1997: a vintage year for Cage.,"I realise that Con Air is about as far from ground-breaking visionary cinema as you can get—Hell, it was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, which speaks volumes about the artistic integrity involved—but as a thrilling slice of slam-bang popcorn action fun, it works a treat.Nicolas Cage plays Cameron Poe, an honourable army ranger who is sent to a maximum-security federal penitentiary after accidentally killing a man while protecting his pregnant wife (Monica Potter). After serving eight years, Cameron is finally given parole, and scheduled to fly home on a C-123 Jailbird aircraft, along with several other prisoners whose number include evil criminal mastermind Cyrus the Virus (John Malkovich) and Poe's likable diabetic cell-mate O'Dell (Mykelti Williamson). Poe's freedom is delayed however, when Cyrus and his equally vile cohorts take over the plane by force, and O'Dell's life is placed in jeopardy...Unlike The Rock, which was an overly dramatic and rather jingoistic affair, Con Air is pure cartoonish excess from start to finish. To try and analyse the plot or apply logic to proceedings is futile, the script conveniently glossing over details as and when it suits (for example, we never learn what Cage's cell-mate O was jailed for; as a result, he becomes a sympathetic character, when the guy could have been a child killer for all we know!). Director Simon West sure isn't concerned about his film making sense, 'cos he's too busy having the time of his life inflicting maximum damage on everyone and everything in the most spectacular manner possible. In this film, the rules are 'don't just have a car crash when you can drag it behind a plane on a hook for a while before smashing it onto a runway?' and 'Don't just kill a man when you can kill him and then drop his corpse from several thousand feet onto a moving vehicle?'.It's stuff like this, coupled with a formidable cast and excellent stunts, pyrotechnics and special effects, that elevate Con Air from the ridiculous to the sublime. I give Con Air a rating of 8 delightfully ruthless maniacs out of 10, making it the second best Nicolas Cage action flick of 1997.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Ultra-Budget Escapism,"You couldn't ask for much more even when it delivers much more than it should. This is one of those Action Movies that throws everything at you but the kitchen sink and then decides to do just that.The ridiculous ending may be too much but once it starts you can't get off the speeding ride. After all, you are already on board so there's not much choice. Not only is there enough action and mayhem, the over the top characters fit right in with the over the top action.Anyone who patronizes a Movie of this sort cannot complain because it is everything that is advertised. This is a frantic, loud, occasionally funny, Hoot. It has a number of quotable lines that would make any Comic Book fan proud.This is quite a trashy triumph of Hollywood excess and is better than most of its type because of its outrageous audacity and unrestrained recklessness. The talent here from the Director to the Stars all contribute.This is in a special category of Ultra-Budget escapism and it ranks in the upper echelons of mind-numbing madness with an atmosphere of testosterone and whimsy that is undeniably utter entertainment for those seeking this sort of thing.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
The mad mad mad mad world of violence,"While not as clever or amusing as _The Rock_, which this was apparently an effort to surpass, it certainly delivers the pyrotechnics. Cage, as always, delivers the best performance he can, given the confines of the script, and his best _Raising Arizona_ drawl.The film's beginning sets a hopeful tone, we see the honorable Cage unjustly imprisoned and preparing to return to his home and the child he has never seen. Meanwhile, the penal system is filling the transport plane which will take Cage to freedom with a cast of the worst criminal psychos behind bars. There is an odd parallel to the beginning of _Stagecoach_ as the plane is loaded with the case of miscreants and a cursory description is given of each criminal. The film has a weakness for hyperbole, each character introduction, each scene, each explosion is meant to top the one before it.Fortunately, the film does have a real ensemble cast, the full roster of villainous character actors: Malkovich, Rhames, Buscemi, Danny Trejo amongst the cons. The law is Cusack and Colm Meaney and Rachel Ticotin (Total Recall). Even Dave Chapelle is amongst the crooks.Ultimately, the film maintains too straight a face during the ruckus. If you are going to ask the audience to accept one outrageous improbability after another, you need to keep it amusing. Chappelle keeps it funny while he's on screen but it's not long enough.Unfortunately, the throttle has only one speed: pedal to the metal. Unlike Woo or McTiernan, who--predictable as they may arguably be--are able to build crescendos and know when to let off the gas, this one keeps on pushing harder and harder until we're feeling a bit catatonic. There is just a terrific amount of pyrotechnics and they use up twice as much powder each time. It never seems to end, which is usually a bad thing for an action movie.But I shouldn't grouse too much. It is definitely an entertaining diversion, and Cage and Cusack are good in their roles, Colm Meaney is as always amusing. Malkovich and Buscemi are creepy enough but not the flamboyant psychos they could have been. Ironically, Cage has exactly that type of charisma (remember _Kiss of Death_, _Snake Eyes_, _Face Off_) but is forced to be restrain himself as the stolid ex-Army ranger.Finally: what the HECK does bruckheimer have against Corvettes???",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Nicolas Cage Delivers Another Action Winner,"""Con Air"" can best be described as ""The Rock"" in the sky.  The film deals with a Gulf War veteran (Nicolas Cage) who becomes a victim of circumstance and is sentenced to eight years in prison.  He is going home via a gigantic prison plane which is also carrying some very unsavory characters (John Malkovich, Ving Rhames, and Steve Buscemi among others).  Of course the evil prisoners take over the plane and it is up to Cage to save the day.  Overall this is a fine action film which keeps its focus on the characters.  4 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Crime
Entertaining for the most part but also ridiculous at times,"""Con Air"" is a typical Jerry Bruckheimer production of the mid to late 90's, more or less along the same lines as ""The Rock"" & ""Armageddon"". Featuring undemanding action executed by a nicely assembled cast, it's the type of movie that's designed for popcorn munching enjoyment rather than garnering prestigious awards. While that approach can often lead to a fairly hollow & trivial experience, in this case the unique premise sets ""Con Air"" apart from countless other routine action flicks.The story revolves around a flight containing some of the nation's most notorious criminals who are on their way to a new maximum security detention center. Little do the authorities know that they've plotted to take over the plane and use it to transport themselves to freedom. Luckily for the good guys, a recent parolee who just happens to be a highly decorated Army Ranger is also on board and he's not too keen on letting these guys have their way.The premise may be fairly high concept but it's an intriguing one. I'd have to say that screenwriter Scott Rosenberg put together a pretty clever plot, even though the last act goes all out in terms of action and, as a result, strays into ludicrousness. There's also quite a bit of memorable dialogue, which is helped immensely by the excellent cast. Nicolas Cage & John Cusack are better than average as the good guys but in my opinion it's the bad guys who really stand out. John Malkovich is always worth watching and here he gives perhaps the movie's best performance as the main villain, Cyrus ""The Virus"" Grissom. His criminal brethren include the likes of Ving Rhames, Danny Trejo, Steve Buscemi, Dave Chappelle & M.C. Gainey. That's an impressive group in and of itself and it's supplemented by a few other standouts like Colm Meaney & Mykelti Williamson.The movie's production values are up to snuff as well, which is no surprise considering that this was a summer blockbuster. The movie garnered an Oscar nomination for its sound along with one for the original song ""How Do I Live"" by Trisha Yearwood. In general, the movie shows the trademark quality of a Jerry Bruckheimer production.Overall, I think that the movie delivers the goods for most of its running time but I find that the extended finale goes a bit too over the top. I can understand why they'd want to go out with a bang but I found the earlier stages to be more intricately plotted than a typical action movie and, as a result, more rewarding. In any case, the movie is worth watching for having a pretty nifty premise along with some entertaining performances from a nicely assembled cast.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Solid action movie...,"""Con Air"" is just one of those action movies that was great back in the day when it was first out and still holds its own today. And that is even despite the fact that it is a Nicolas Cage movie.The story is quite straight forward, a plane transporting the most dangerous and deadly of criminals gets hijacked by the very same prisoners it was supposed to transport. Amongst the prisoners is Cameron Poe who is on his way home to his family and tries his best to see to it that it happens.There is a lot of action in the movie, almost from start to end, and it nicely choreographed and executed. But there is also a lot of really interesting and detailed characters in the movie.But even more impressively is the ensemble of cast which is nothing short of amazing. And ""Con Air"" holds some impressive performances by John Malkovich and Steve Buscemi in particular.""Con Air"" has a lot of one-liners, of course, throughout the movie. You can't have a proper action movie without those. And then there is Nicolas Cage's hair, are you kidding me? ""Con Air"" is well-worth a place in any movie fan's or collector's collection.I will end my review here, before the bunny gets it...",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Now that's what I'm talking about!,"As much cliché there is on this typical action flick, this was a terrific and fun one to watch! Come on! I mean a 6.3?! People, this was a great movie that kept you on the edge of your seat with some of the greatest actors of our time: Nic Cage, John Malkovich, and John Cusack. The movie though went to Steve Buscemi! He is just becoming one of my favorite actors, but I'll explain later. Con Air is about these prisoners who have taken over an air plane meant to transfer some prisoners to other states and some are actually free. There is one person, Cameron Poe, who wants to stop this maniac, Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom played by John M. from destroying these men's lives.John Cusack plays Vince Larkin, a Marshall who believes that Poe is on his side and wants to get this plane down as safely as he can, he does a terrific job, even though his looks aren't what I would've pictured for the part. John M. did a great job on scarring the heck out of me and was a terrific psychotic villain and Nic is so great as an action hero while he ""saves the *beep* day"", he also has this southern accent that is kind of funny but charming. Now, onto Steve who plays Garland 'The Marietta Mangler' Greene, this incredibly intelligent but insane serial killer who gives you a Hannibal the Cannibal vibe. His dialog is incredible and grabs you ""What if I told you insane was working fifty hours a week in some office for fifty years at the end of which they tell you to *beep* off; ending up in some retirement village hoping to die before suffering the indignity of trying to make it to the toilet on time? Wouldn't you consider that to be insane?"" He's funny in a way that wasn't meant to be funny and he just steals the show. Especially how he was singing ""He's got the whole world in his hands"" at the end when the plane was going crazy. :DThese are remarkable actors, and yes, while the story is predictable and the stunts are over the top, nevertheless, I think anyone can enjoy this film an just have fun. It's a great action flick that deserves a look and a better rating! Come on, let go and have fun. Grab the popcorn, because you're going on a ride!9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
so ridiculous that it's kind of fun,"Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) is released from the Army Rangers and reunited with his pregnant wife (Monica Potter). He is challenged by 3 drunks outside of a bar and kills one. He is sentenced to 7 to 10 years in prison. He gets paroled and he's hitching a plane ride until his release. The plane has his friend cellmate Baby-O (Mykelti Williamson) as well as many dangerous supermax prisoners on their way to a new prison. Vince Larkin (John Cusack) is overseeing the transfer with DEA wildman Duncan Malloy (Colm Meaney) running a sting on a drug lord. Malloy sneaks a gun with his undercover agent onto the plane. Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom (John Malkovich) masterminds an escape plan with Pinball (Dave Chappelle) stealing the keys from Guard Sally Bishop (Rachel Ticotin). Diamond Dog (Ving Rhames) is a militant black prisoner.This is an over-the-top ridiculous cartoon action thriller. One has to leave all reasonable logic behind. There is a lot of unnecessary overacting by Meaney. With all the great action, the movie should be a lot more thrilling and intense. The jokey irreverent feel makes it less intense. After awhile, it's not about the plot or whether Baby-O gets the help. It's what other ridiculous things are they going to pull. I have to roll my eyes when Steve Buscemi arrives as Hannibal Lecter. However it is so ridiculous that it's kind of fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Classic high energy Nicholas Cage's best action flick he ever made!,"Con Air (1997) is a classic high energy Nicholas Cage's best bad-ass action flick from the 90's of the decade he ever made! I grew up watching this film as a child and honestly it was my favorite action film and the first one from Nicholas Cage I have ever saw. After seeing Con Air for the first time, I bagged my mom to buy me The Rock and Face/Off along with Con Air on VHS because of Nicholas Cage! I still have all three films on VHS and I also have them on Blu-ray. I don't like Face/Off anymore I have my reasons, but Con Air is a bad ass action film and it is still my favorite action film today that I love to death. I have a blast watching this film.Plot: Newly paroled ex-con and former U.S. Ranger Cameron Poe finds himself trapped in a prisoner transport plane when the passengers seize control.The film is actually about Cameron Poe (Nicholas Cage) U.S. Ranger who accidentally kills a man in self defense when three goon's try's to kill him. Cameron confesses the crime, but because of his military past, Cameron gets 7 - 10. years maximum prison after years his paroled and only what he want's is to get home to his wife and to his daughter he never saw before. Cameron has to share a prison airplane with some of the country's most dangerous criminals, who actually take control of the plane and are now planning to escape the country. Cameron has to find a way to stop them while playing along. Meanwhile, United States Marshal Vincent Larkin (John Cusack) is trying to help Cameron get free and stop the criminals, including Cyrus ""The Virus"" Grissom (John Malkovich).Everyone in the cast is great and Nic Cage's Cameron Poe is one of my favorite action heroes of all time. With such lines as ""I'm gonna show you God does exist"" and ""I'm gonna save the f**king day"" you know you're dealing with a Grade A bad ass. He's not without a sensitive side though as he is prone to crying like a girl at some points too. Con Air is directed from Simon West, who directed also The Expendables 2 another film , that I love.Why I love this movie: You have a solid likable cast that I love, awesome score from Mark Mancina, cool characters, ton's of action, a lot's of explosions, lot's of gun fire and awesome fights, including incredible stunts that I love. Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, John Malkovich, Ving Rhames, Renoly Santiago, Danny Trejo, Mykelti Williamson, Rachel Ticotin, Colm Meaney, Dave Chappelle, Nick Chinlund, Steve Buscemi, Monica Potter and M. C. Gainey gave us a wonderful action performance in a action film I have ever seen.Nicolas Cage as Cameron Poe is a bad ass action decent hero, that I love him so much. John Cusack as U.S. Marshall Vince Larkin is awesome and incredible likable hero in this movie. John Malkovich as Cyrus Grissom is a bad ass villain and he is also very brilliant and insane. Colm Meaney as DEA Agent Duncan Malloy is amazing I really love this actor in this film. Mostly I remember Colm from Under Siege who played Dummer William Stranix's (Tommy Lee Jones) second hand, even in Under Siege I loved him as acting performance. I love Colm's character in this movie. Nick Chinlund as William Bedford was awesome I love the fight scenes with Billy and Cameron and Billy says to Cameron ""Die Punk!"" and Cameron kill's him. I love Steve Buscemi as Garland Greene, I love his character I don't think his character is dangerous or a serial killer, because on the airport Garland doesn't kill a young girl a child, I think he redeemed him self. Last one that I love is Ving Rhames as Nathan Jones was another bad ass villain.I love that Cameron is desperately try's to safe his friend's life Mike O'Dell aka Baby-O (Mykelti Williamson) and get him out of the plane and he try' to safe Guard Sally Bishop (Rachel Ticotin) off the plain. He even safe's her on the plain twice when Johnny 23 (Danny Trejo) try's to rape her. I love that Baby-O protects Cameron against Cyrus and confess that he is a traitor on a plain, but he wasn't. I love this flick.There a re a lot of action scenes that I completely love and I have enjoyed them including a explosion's fire truck who explodes in Las Vegas. A lot of gun fights. Cameron using his martial art's skills on a air field, Cameron beating three guys on a plain and force the pilot to land the plain down. The car chase scenes in Las Vegas where incredible Vince and Cameron see them Cyrus,Swamp Thing and Jones trying to flee, pursue them on motorcycles.Overall: Con Air (1997) get's a perfect 10 by for incredible awesome high energy solid action flick of the 90's that I love to death!Con Air is a 1997 American action film directed by Simon West and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, producer of The Rock.

A Good Movie That Got Bogged Down With Greed,"`Con Air' more or less defines the term `popcorn movie'  it's an action film designed strictly to entertain.  The film's emphasis is on flash, flair, and adrenaline, with a smattering of humor and story spread throughout for good measure.  Not exactly the most lofty of goals, but the desire to entertain is quite sincere, and `Con Air' does largely succeed in the entertainment department.Where `Con Air' falls apart, however, is the grandiose, grandstanding way in which it tells its story.  Subtlety is a word that is impossible to use in describing this film.  `Con Air' is a firm believer in the concept that more must be better  ten explosions must be better than one; three psychotic villains must be better than two; and so on.  The `bigger is better' approach never truly turns the film into an utter mess, but it does bog it down to a certain extent  what could've been a fantastic action movie becomes, well, just better than average.  A leaner and meaner `Con Air' could've been a classic.`Con Air' is the story of good-guy Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage), an Army Ranger unjustly tossed in prison for eight long years for protecting his family from a drunken, knife-wielding maniac. Finally paroled, Poe is placed on a converted troop transport plane that will take him home to his family. However, also on board the plane is a roster of psychotic criminals vaguely reminiscent of the Legion of Doom from the old `Superfriends' cartoon. There's Cyrus the Virus (John Malkovich), an articulate, thoughtful madman with a penchant for automatic weapons; Diamond Dog (Ving Rhames), a black militant and Cyrus' trusted lieutenant (or so Cyrus thinks, at any rate); Johnny 23 (Danny Trejo), a serial rapist; Garland Greene (Steve Buscemi), a serial killer in the Hannibal Lecter vein who is treated as the resident prison celebrity; and a good half-dozen other colorful characters to flesh out this flying rogues' gallery of nightmare criminals.  Under Cyrus' direction, the criminals take control of the plane, and it's up to the beleaguered Poe to save the day, with some help from good-guy U.S. Marshal Larkin (John Cusack) on the ground, who's seemingly the only person in U.S. law enforcement capable of deciphering Poe's brief and cryptic messages to the authorities.The film moves along at a brisk pace, cheerfully glossing over its own improbabilities.  `Con Air' is definitely the kind of film that only works if you don't stop to think about it, and director Simon West keeps things going quick enough to keep most of the ludicrous plot holes mercifully brief.  He manages to cut from one story arc to another with a certain amount of skill, keeping each arc from completely snowballing into something unmanageable.  However, the juggling act wears thin by the end of the movie  there's simply too much to try to balance.  It's not particularly Simon West's fault (although he does have an annoying penchant for overusing the slow-motion explosion filmed from five different angles, a lá `The A-Team'), but more a by-product of the script. The second half of the film has forced moments, where the only purpose of the action scenes seems to be to completely outdo the action scenes in the first half.  These scenes are undeniably cool looking, but they're filler, and filler can only take a movie so far.  A good third of the film  story, action scenes, you name it  could've easily been excised from the film, and not only would it never be missed, `Con Air' would actually be vastly improved.Even the characters, while entertaining, wind up just overwhelming the film. The villain Diamond Dog, as played by Ving Rhames, is charismatic, menacing, and a truly inspired movie bad guy . . . and he's also completely gratuitous.  As Cyrus the Virus, John Malkovich is also charismatic, menacing, and a truly inspired movie bad guy . . . just like Diamond Dog. The movie simply doesn't have room for both villains (and it definitely doesn't have room for the Lecter-inspired Garland Green, who Steve Buscemi turns into an odd sort of comic relief, but otherwise serves no purpose in the film.)  ONE villain would've been plenty.  Ditto the heroes: Cage is good, Cusack is good, but c'mon, pick ONE.  Like the rest of the film, the characters become too much, and wind up becoming pure overkill.In many ways, `Con Air' looks like the results of a Hollywood brainstorming meeting gone haywire, where a thousand ideas are slapped down onto a notepad. . . but these ideas don't necessarily mesh well together.  Most of the ideas in `Con Air' are surprisingly decent, there's just too many of them. (How many times have you heard that about an action movie?)Overall, `Con Air' is okay, and if you're in the mood for fun, mindless action, it gets the job done.  Personally, I'd recommend watching `The Rock' instead it's by far the best of the recent spate of Bruckheimer action flicks  but  `Con Air', for all its excesses, has its own good moments, too.

The ultimate guy movie!,"Macho's in a non-stop action movie with lot's of explosions. This is ladies and gentlemen; the ultimate guy movie.The movie is filled with crazy over the top characters such as Pinball, Johnny-23, The Marietta Mangler and Sally-can't-dance. It has some of the best casting in a movie I have ever seen. The actors are all simply perfect for their roles. Especially John Malkovich and Steve Buscemi are excellent as always and their characters are the best of the movie even though Buscemi's character wasn't really needed at all. The introduction of the prisoners at the beginning of the movie is completely over the top but I love it! It possibly is one of my favorite scene's in cinema history when we first meet Cyrus the Virus and Diamond Dog, the music really sets the mood in that scene.Of course the story is not important, it's all about explosions, shootings, fist fights and everything in between. But dislike other action movies ""Con Air"" actually has a story that I like, even though it's completely over the top. Although I think that the movie might had been better of without the Poe's family scene's and storyline, even though I still sort of like the emotional scene's between them. Also I think that Nicholas Cage is a bit too much of a good guy in the movie, not only does he help his friend on board, he even finds time to try and save all the cops their lives and that of the bunny present for his daughter.A good thing is the excellent soundtrack by Trevor Rabin and Mark Mancina that gives the movie an extra 'cool' feeling.One little point of critic is that the editing isn't always great.

"Pretty standard stuff, but enjoyable enough","Con Air is what I've come to expect of a standard Hollywood action flick, nothing more, nothing less. It's got plenty of action, big explosions, one-liners and pure entertainment value. The plot is pretty good, somewhat original, and fairly fast-paced. The acting is good, and the film has a surprisingly large amount of well-known good actors; Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, Danny Trejo, Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames and John Malkovich. They all give good performances, as do most of the supporting actors. The characters are well-written and credible. I found it interesting how most of the characters aren't all black or white in their actions and personalities; many of them have a shade of gray or two. The action is well-done, exciting and intense. The special effects(the few there are) are good enough. The ending may be a little extreme, but it's a good climax, and the good things in the film make up for the bad; granted, there are a few downright lame parts, but there are far more good parts than bad. All in all, everything you'd expect from a Jerry Bruckheimer action film, and nothing else. I recommend it to fans of standard action films. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
This is going to be wildly unpopular but...,"I'm sorry but this really isn't a great movie, even by ludicrous 90s action flicks standards. Look, I'm not above over the top, ridiculous and cheesy action movies as I grew up in the 80s/90s on those and there are many I do enjoy and I think still hold up considering their specific genre. But I somehow never got to see this classic and my friends insisted I should give it a go. And while all the elements are there (preposterous action, dumb dialogue with cliché one-liners, stereotypical hero-type main character, etc.) for me they just didn't work well enough together to make this the entertaining 90 minutes I thought it would be. I ended up finding myself bored most of the time... so maybe it will work for you better than it did for me but I can't really recommend it.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Thankyou For Choosing Con Air...,"Con Air is just simply mindless entertainment! The script is full of hard-as-nails characters, each nicely developed to melodramatic point, with Nicholas Cage's con the moral centre. The only exception probably being Steve Buscemi's Ed Gein-esquire Garland Green who offers a slight variation on what we come to expect as your typical lifer con! O.K, so the plot does have a few holes that need filing and the whole thing is pretty unoriginal but the ridiculousness of the premise does call for some suspension of disbelief.

Kick Back and Have Fun,"Con Air (1997)*** (out of 4)Newly released con Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) just wants to see his six-year-old daughter and wife for the first time but to do so he must battle a plane full of some of the worst criminals in the country including Cyrus The Virus (John Malkovich). CON AIR doesn't have too many brains but it's certainly a highly entertaining film with some of the most memorable and fun characters that you're going to see in a picture like this. I certainly hopes no one comes to a movie like this expecting some sort of art-house picture because those folks will just be cheating themselves. Those wanting a lot of things blowing up will certainly be entertained by this. The greatest thing going in the film's favor is the terrific cast, which not only includes Cage and Malkovich but we also get the likes of Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames, Dave Chappelle, Danny Trejo, John Cusack, Mykelti Williamson and Colm Meaney. The terrific cast certainly adds a lot of fun to the picture as the supporting players all fit their roles wonderfully and there's no question that the two leads are perfect. Malkovich chews up the scenery in the role of the bad guy who you can easily fear but also tell how smart he is. Cage, with a hilariously fun Southern accent, is also extremely good in the part and is smart enough to know when it's best to just wink at the viewer and have some fun. Another major plus are the stunts and action scenes. There's certainly some great stuff here including the finale with the plane landing in Las Vegas and of course the end stuff with the firefighter truck. Throughout the picture we're given all sorts of fun situations and it certainly doesn't hurt that we've got all these likable characters. CON AIR isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination but it's certainly a lot of fun and that's all that matters.",,Anonymous,Crime
"""I'm goner show you God does exist""","`Oh the Action Movie', as a child of the eighties I was practically raised on a diet of loud explosions, simple scenarios, white vests and killer one liners.  So with so many action films around, why do I turn my attention to the only slightly above average `Con Air'?  Well, for a start, I watched it last night and it's still fresh in my mind, but besides that Con Air represents every aspect of the turning point of the action movie.  So it's one small step for entertainment, one giant leap for Jerry Bruckheimer's bank balance.  The simple scenario of Con Air involves Parolee Cameron Poe (Cage) hitching a ride home to his wife after a seven-year sentence for murder.  Of Course Cage didn't mean to destroy the hillbillies' vocal chords at the start of the film, that wouldn't be very heroic, instead he is protecting the honour of his ladylove.  This being Hollywood, we couldn't let the hero be a real killer, but that doesn't stop the film-makers populating the rest of the film with the most adorable host of paedophiles, rapists, and murderers, some of whom only serve as nothing more than comic relief.You see, this is the big plot mover in Con Air, every action movie has a plot mover, be it the taking of the Building in Die Hard, or Sarah Conner's decision to run in The Terminator, in Con Air, as luck would have it, Cameron Poe is being delivered out of captivity on a prison airplane.  Not just any airplane mind, this one is filled with said jolly bunch of paedophiles, rapists, and murderers and as if we couldn't guess, the maniacs end up taking over the asylum.  What follows may not be Bergman, but it does constitute as some damn fine, time tested entertainment, for as we all know Bruckheimer is of the, `if it ain't broke don't fix it' school of producing, so here we have a (just under) two hour re-hash of Bad Boys, The Rock and Top Gun.  The film follows the path we would expect it to and ends in exactly the way we knew it would, but it doesn't matter how tired and predictable the film may be, because it does what it's supposed to do, and that is to deliver a solid piece of mind-diverting entertainment with all the loud explosions, white vests and killer one liners (`Buckle-up') that any action film fan craves for.Elsewhere, the acting, for this kind of film anyway, is first class, with a definite ensemble at play.  Besides Cage, who continues his role of the action hero that he perfected in The Rock, and later carried through to Face-Off, this time however, delivering all his lines with an hilarious deep southern twang (`Dis iz your Barbeque an it taste gud' is just one side splitter), but adding to his star power we also have the two Johnnies, Cusack and Malkovich as the Good and Bad elements.  Both are good in their respected roles and there is fine support from Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames and Colm Meaney.  To top it all off, the director is Simon West (aka Michael Bay without pretension) who applies an unbelievable amount of colour filters and MTV editing, that we have now come to expect from the Hollywood crap factory.  So to finish, Con Air is a decent enough action movie that washes over the brain and leaves you punching the air with excitement, it may not be high art, but it's still a pretty fun ride.  7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
B Movie Magnificence,"I say B movie not because of anything deficient but because its not trying to be an Oscar contender.
Its a ridiculous movie, drowning in a great cast that is clearly having a good time making something this OTT.The only action sequence missing from the movie is some kind of trip to space, aside from that it seems to cover the lot.Hard to pick a stand out actor amongst them but I enjoyed the moments of Colm Meaney.If you want a bigger than big night in at the movies go the triple Cage 90's bonanza...

PUT THE BUNNY BACK IN THE BOX; Would Recommend,"Con Air was directed by Simon West and stars our lord and saviour Nicholas Cage, John Malkovich and John Cuasck. ​Just-paroled army ranger Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) is headed back to his wife (Monica Potter), but must fly home aboard a prison transport flight dubbed ""Jailbird"" with some of the worst criminals living. Along with Diamond Dog (Ving Rhames) and Baby-O (Mykelti Williamson), genius serial killer Cyrus ""The Virus"" Grissom (John Malkovich) unleashes a violent escape plot in mid-flight. Secretly working with U.S. Marshall Vince Larkin (John Cusack), Poe tries to foil Grissom's plan.This movie can be genuinely summed up with the simple phrase 'PUT THE BUNNY BACK IN THE BOX'. Nothing more needs to be said but I took notes while watching so why not? All the acting was great in this movie, it has a cheesy, stupid story, dialogue straight from the word of God and absurd action. This movie is the best bad movie I've ever seen in my entire life. It shouldn't be as good as it is. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie; it's pure, unfiltered stupid fun and I beg of you to watch this movie at least one point in your life.The story for this movie is so stupid, so cheesy, so ridiculous that it makes it better than Shawshank. A script can be so bad it's good and this movie proves that. If you watch this movie looking for a dark, gritty, realistic crime thriller then read the quote in the summary and rethink your mindset. It's so dumb and unrealistic but that is what makes it perfect. If I actually cared, the story would be awful but this movie is so fun that you shouldn't care.Nicholas Cage was so cheesy in this movie and his accent is thicker than the 38th parallel. He knew EXACTLY what he was doing in this movie and relished in that fact. John Malkovich was amazing as Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom and is easily the best part of this movie. Cyrus is such a great villain; he's a pure psychopath and sociopath but has so much charisma that it's genuinely frightening but also amazing. John Cusack was good as Vince Larkin. Steve Buscemi was good as Garland Greene as was Danny Trejo as Johnny 23. Every actor in this movie did a good job and knew exactly what type of movie they were in. Every single inmate has a sickening degree of likability to them and was very memorable.Technically, this movie was awful. The cinematography was awful and the editing was just sad. The effects were awful and the set design consisted of plane.The action in this movie is absolutely absurd and that makes it so much better. It's stupid fun and doesn't work in any way but that is what makes it worse. This movie's primary goal is to provide a mental time and it does that to the nth degree.Honestly, I could vote this movie for having the best dialogue in any movie ever, along with Face/Off and The Wicker Man'(Something convenient there don't think). The line 'PUT THE BUNNY BACK IN THE BOX' and 'MAKE A MOVE, AND THE BUNNY GETS IT' being two of the greatest lines of dialogue ever written. It's now official that Scott Rosenburg(co-writer of that beloved classic 'Kangaroo Jack') is officially a better writer than Roald Dahl, Steven King, William Shakespeare and J.R Tolkien purely for those two lines.In conclusion, this movie is awful. I mean it is but it is so much stupid fun. I love it. I can name so many flaws with this movie but none of them matter if you take this movie for what it is. If you can do that, then you will enjoy this movie immensely.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Underrated,"John Malkovich gives a ground breaking performance as Cyrus the Virus in this movie and you won't find a similar performance anywhere else. He and John Cusak actually overshadow Nicholas Cage for the most part of this movie. This movie is just filled with so many things that will keep you entertained and amused from start to finish, leave you extremely satisfied and force you to come back and watch the movie all over again. You also wont find such a huge assembly of stars in most other movies either. The same guys wont shy to display their attitudes as well. The story is good and the action is even better. The cinematography and screenplay are also top notch. This movie was a box office hit and I can't understand why its rated so low?",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Nicolas Cage- feminist of the year,"It's hardly good quality, but a campy fun time nevertheless- Con Air makes the most out of its often convoluted and ridiculous plot- serving up a fun heap of action and star studded talent all wrapped into one package. Obviously with this film, we have to talk about Nicolas Cage, who plays easily one of the coolest action characters on screen since Kurt Russell's snake. So many of these odd macho heroes are so sexist and even racist at times, but Cage's character puts a lot of his stereotype to rest and truly makes the most out of it with his performance. The action throughout is pretty fun at times, and I enjoyed a lot of the subtext and concepts of the U. S. criminal system throughout- an interesting although not so subtle commentary at times. The cinematography is that greatest 90's burnt orange, and the side characters all have their fun little quirks. It's no groundbreaking formula, and at times it can butt its head, but it is rather fun to watch. I also enjoyed John Cusack's performance- a different change of pace for him at this point in his career- and found the music to be quite exciting and charming at times as well. In the end, Cage's badass yet irreverent new take on his leading hero makes the film what it is- and gives us a lot to look forward too through its somewhat predictable story. It may feel familiar and dull at times, but its action scenes are well made, and there is a lot of heart in the film in general which helps it sticks out on its own. It's far from perfect, but Con Air makes the best with what it has- and proves to be a fun campy delight for all action fans and fans of Cage's work.My Rating: 6.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Con Air is an average action movie, nothing special.","By today's low standards, you could argue that Con Air is a solid 6-star film based on the scale featured here.However, it was still a disappointing '90s flick. It's got nothing on the Die Hard series, Lethal Weapon movies, or Speed (1994).I personally didn't care for Nicolas Cage's Alabama accent in this movie. It just wasn't believable; I wasn't buying it.More importantly, we don't get much of a backstory on Cyrus ""the Virus,"" Nathan ""Diamond Dog,"" or Garland ""The Marietta Mangler"" Greene. All of their names are interesting. There was potential here.Though, there was just not much going on throughout parts of this movie for viewers to be emotionally invested. The worst part of this film was the dialogue. Nothing flowed naturally.Interactions between characters never seemed organic. In other words, the jokes and conversations were forced. The director took the cheesiness of the '90s and turned it up to the max.A general rule of filmmaking is to never turn cheesiness up to the max, unless it's for a comedy.The over-the-top action sequences were OK for the most part. The practical effects were great. Needless to say, the explosions were typical for this movie genre.If you're looking for an in-depth story with plot twists and believable dialogue between real human beings, this film isn't for you. Having said all of this, action movies nowadays are much worse.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Take the ride,"Strap yourselves in, fasten your seatbelts and prepare for one of the most exhilarating thrill rides of your life as ""Con Air"" takes you on a two-hour adventure that includes an all-star cast, powerful action sequences and great direction. Everyone will be glad to learn that ""Con Air"" is an action film that is able to have a great story to accompany it.Originality and believability are two more keys to the success of a film because if nobody believes the story, success can be thrown out the window. ""Con Air"" revolves around a plane carrying high-risk prisoners being transported to a maximum-security prison. However, the prisoners have other ideas.Action films cannot survive without the right cast in place to portray the heroes and villains; therefore, the director must locate the right talent who has the correct chemistry to make it work. For ""Con Air,"" the director chose five immensely and incredibly talented actors who fit this formula. Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, John Malkovich, Ving Rhames lead an all-star, stellar cast in ""Con Air."" Chemistry between cast members is key to the success of every movie. It didn't take long to realize these five actors contained a massive amount of chemistry.Cage stars as Cameron Poe, a parolee on his way home to his wife and daughter until he runs into a problem and save the day. Cage is one of the most versatile actors I have come across. Playing everything from a romantic lead in ""It Could Happen To You"" and Moonstruck"" to dramatic roles in ""Leaving Las Vegas"" and ""Bringing Out The Dead"" to comedic roles in ""Trapped In Paradise"" and ""Guarding Tess."" Cage is the ultimate action star combining all of these elements to bring home the role of Cameron Poe. For this reason, I'm proud to call him one of my favorite actors.Monica Potter and young newcomer Landry Albright star as Cameron's wife and daughter to whom he is flying home to after being paroled. Potter's beauty radiates off the screen with such heat and force I almost melt.She may not be a veteran, but Potter's poise, beauty, talent and presence has proven that she could be mistaken for one. I relish every opportunity I had to watch her on screen because I knew what I was seeing was something special. Potter is on the rise with awards in her future and great films on the horizon.Albright's performance as Casey brought smiles to my face because she is one of the cutest and most talented newcomers to hit Hollywood in recent years. Albright may not have a lot of dialogue, but her presence on screen is a sight for sore eyes, her beauty is hypnotizing and her energy is electric.Albright will have a long, bright future in acting if she decides to pursue the profession because she has the special sparkle in her eye and aura surrounding her. I can't wait to see her next film.Malkovich is Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom, the ringleader of the hijacking. Malkovich's face oozes with villainous intent, which is one of the reasons he is so great at playing one. With his role in ""Con Air,"" he proves once again he is the best. Cyrus was calm, cool, and collected in the face of danger as he led his group of convicts.I have gained a new respect for Malkovich because I was able to see the true range and versatility he brought to the role.However, the best was yet to come as I learned that the supporting cast was a welcome surprise. For example, Rhames is Nathan 'Diamond Dog' Jones, Cyrus' right hand man. Mykelti Williamson stars as Baby-O O'Dell, Poe's only friend on board ""The Jailbird."" John Cusack is Vince Larkin, a federal agent, who from the ground is doing his best to bring down the plane full of convicts. At odds with Larkin is Duncan Malloy, played by Colm Meaney.Another aspect of ""Con Air"" I enjoyed was the writing because the film was able to tell a story with substance without letting the action take over. Creating great character development and story depth are just a few examples how the writers were able to win me over.The special effects in ""Con Air"" is great that it made me feel as if were part of that flight right along with the convicts. I commend director Simon West, and producer Jerry Bruckheimer on how well they put together the action sequences and bringing together the tremendous cast without any clash of egos.Finally, the one thing that signed, sealed, and delivered this movie was the signature song performed by Trisha Yearwood called ""How Do I Live."" It remains my favorite song even today, five years after ""Con Air"" was released.This is an action packed film from start to finish that has a believable plot; as well as comedic moments at times with great one-liners by various actors. I urge everyone to see ""Con Air"" for a great action film with substance.",,Anonymous,Crime
Buckle Up,"Con Air was a simple enough movie in its plot. Some very dangerous criminals are being transported to an Alabama prison via a prison plane. The prisoners had other plans which amounted to hijacking the plane and going to a South American country with a no extradition policy. Poe (Nicolas Cage) wasn't ready to go along with that plan.This movie was made in Nicolas Cage's heyday. He had come out with Leaving Las Vegas, The Rock, Con Air and Face Off all in a row. All solid movies. Con Air is truly a high octane action movie full of zingers and one-liners. It was pure mindless entertainment in a good way. Although I didn't realize it in '97 this movie had quite the all-star lineup. Cage, Malkovich, Cusack, Buscemi, Rhames, Chappelle, Trejo and even Mykelti Williamson who was Bubba Gump.Forgetting Cage's TERRIBLE southern accent this was his chance to be a real action movie hero. He even got to show off his shredded physique. John Malkovich was excellent. He was made for the ranting psychotic role. And Chappelle was vintage Chappelle funny as heck. I count this among the memorable movies of the 90's and definitely one of Cage's better flicks.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Nothing Much More than a Fun Action Flick,but it's Very Fun,","Con Air is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a great cast.It's certainly not an outstanding piece of film,but the reason why I'm rating it so well is simply because I find this movie very fun to watch,it's a very well made action movie that is quite intense at times and a straight forward story.The cast is, admittedly, hard to take seriously at times, Nicolas Cage's character was a bit too overly dramatic at times and some of his dialogue just sounded ridiculous coming out of his mouth,but I wouldn't have preferred anyone else in this part. The highlight of the movie is certainly John Malkovich, he really brings class and sophistication to this movie with a very dramatic and somewhat frightening performance that is much more believable that any other actor in this. Its simply a fun action movie that may take itself too seriously,but I enjoyed Con Air for what it's worth and would recommend it if you ever see it on television and are looking for a good action movie to kill some time.Chaos ensues after prisoners hijack a plane transporting convicts to a maximum security facility.Best Performance: John Malkovich Worst Performance: Colm Meaney",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

The day he is supposed to be released. He gets trapped in a prisoner transport plane when the convicts decide to hijack the plane. Can Nicolas Cage save the day?*Minor Spoilers*This movie is so dumb that it's not even funny. It's loud, in your face, and totally entertaining! Right from the opening where we are treated to Nicolas Cage sporting a laughably bad Southern accent, I knew I was in for some cheesy fun. The action scenes are gloriously spectacular to watch. It's filled with explosions, cheesy one liners from Cage, and totally improbable situations which make it all the more fun to watch. How can you not love the sheer audacity of Nicolas Cage continuing to strive forward towards the baddies on the plane and act like nothing has happened, despite the fact that he gets shot in the arm while doing so. Some of the stunts in this one had to be extremely expensive. The finale in this movie takes place on the streets of Las Vegas. I won't spoil it, but let's just say the destruction that commences is somewhat breathtaking to watch. It's totally illogical, but who cares. For almost two hours, you'll get your money's worth in this one if you're an action junkie.I'm still a fan of Nicolas Cage, despite his unlucky string of many terrible movies as of late. It's not exactly a great performance, but he is a lot of fun to watch. He has a really bad mullet while having a bit of a lone wolf character, which carries a heavy heart. His breezy character is pretty illogical, but I had a hoot with him. His star power is very apparent in this one. John Malkovich can play this type of role in his sleep. Not many people can play an entertaining villain like him. I loved his show! John Cusack provides great support as the United States Marshal, and manages to overcome slight miscasting with charisma and charm to spare. He doesn't feel like the Marshall kind of type, but he did really good; David Chapelle is the comedic relief (Not that the movie needed it!) Ving Rhames, Danny Trejo, Rachel Ticotin, M.C Gainey & Monica Potter all do their roles well. Steve Buscemi is a scene stealer in this one, despite not having much screen timeFinal Thoughts: I had fun. It's very stupid, but fun. The critics that rip into it aren't getting the big picture here. You can rip into the script all you want, but this is set to entertain the masses, and that's exactly what it does. Just enjoy the fun cast, all the explosions, and have a blast with this cheese fest.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Best action film of the late 90s,"Jerry Bruckheimer's production style rarely makes a good movie but Con Air is one of those rare exceptions in which all the OTT mayhem and full-on action make a film so exciting it scorches when you watch it.Nic Cage (in a typically bad performance) is Cameron Poe, a US Ranger who is sent to prison for accidentally killing a thug who attacks his pregnant wife. After 8 years of porridge he is freed and hitches a ride home on a prison plane called The Jailbird. But this is no ordinary flight.On Board are a small army of America's toughest crooks including Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom (John Malkovich) a men on death row for murder, robbery, kidnapping and extortion. Nathan 'Diamond Dog' Jones (Ving Rhames), a black militant inside for murder. Billy Bedlam (Nick Chinlund), inside for killing his cheating wife's family and dog. Pinball Parker (Dave Chapelle), a pimp and drug-dealer. Swamp Thing (MC Gainey) a pilot who knows a few things about a good hijack. And finally Garland Green AKA The Marietta Mangler (Steve Buscemi) a serial killer in for killing a zillion people and crossing 2 state borders wearing a girls head as a hat.As you can tell, with such a eclectic bunch of psychos on board it's only a matter of seconds before all hell breaks loose. As soon as the plane is in the air the cons have taken over, restrained or killed the guards and have changed the destination from prison to South America.Poe, being the good-hearted sort of chap that he is, doesn't rat out as his best pal needs his insulin shot and no one else will help. It's up to Poe to sneakily round up the baddies until US Marshall Larkin (John Cusack) and the cavalry can get there. Easier said than done, as double-crosses, suspicious cons and incompetent authority foul everything up. The result is action overload as the film blazes through to it's anarchic, devastating climax upon another anarchic, devastating climax. At the end you'll be left breathless and your senses stinging with over-stimulation. Con Air is everything an action film should be.Steve Buscemi steals the whole show. His deadpan, bug-eyed and dare I say 'innocent' portrayal of a deranged killer is the centrepiece of the whole film. The scene where he sings with a little girl (and continues later on) will either freak you out or steal your heart. And the ending is the best you could hope for.Mark Mancina and Trevor Rabin provide a loud, blaring score of thrash-metal and acoustic guitars with the usual Media Ventures flare. It's brilliant stuff and I suggest you hunt down the (sadly incomplete) score CD. And this really did deserve the Best Original Song award over that pansy Titanic one.Superior to both The Rock and Face/Off, Con Air is Nic Cage at his (worst) best as an action hero and Bruckheimer at his best as an action producer.

The guiltiest of all the guilty pleasures,"Of all the guilty pleasures the Hollywood action machine (often headed by Don Simpson and/or Jerry Bruckheimer) churned out during the 1990s, Con Air may just be the guiltiest. Utilizing a premise that incorporates most every type of movie villain at once, the film piles it on with more of everything: more characters, more campy dialogue, more at stake, and, of course, more fire, explosions and action. As we get to meet the passengers aboard the ""Con Air"", you realize that you've seen all these criminal types in other renditions before, from the coldblooded, eloquent mastermind (Cyrus the Virus/John Malkovich), via the emotionless, psychopathic serial killer (Steve Buscemi as Garland Greene) to the hotblooded black nationalist (Ving Rhames as Diamond Dog) and the crazed sexual sadist (Danny Trejo). And of course, you've also seen the hero before; a man so idiotically heroic that he by all logic would have gotten himself killed a long time ago. Nicolas Cage's deadpan performance becomes increasingly fun (and possibly ingenious) as the film slowly develops from serious prison drama to gung-ho Hollywood extravaganza. When director Simon West captures Cage in slow-mo, smiling and shaking his long, wavy hair, you realize that the filmmakers actually knew all along what they were doing. Although there's a good chance not all the players were quite in on the joke. Con Air is too much in most every respect, and it even pushes the envelope within the scope of exaggeration. But it's got a sweetness to it that makes it quite enjoyable from beginning to end - almost like an epitome of the term 'guilty pleasure'. There are also a number of delightful performances to enjoy: Malkovich, Buscemi, Rhames, and Dave Chapelle are all having a field day. This silly thing still is an enjoyable watch after a quarter of a century.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Excellent action film.,"I love explosions in action movies. This one's got 'em LOL I've watched it so many times, but it never gets boring.
Steve Buscemi is a stand out, of course. John Cusack, Colm Meaney and John Malkovich (playing it straight!) are excellent in their roles. I was really tickled with Colm Meaney in his role. It's nice to see him playing an out-and-out prick.
The rest of the cast was either well-chosen, well-directed or are just great actors - yup, it's a great cast. I haven't seen Nick Chinlund in enough roles - I am a big fan of his. I'll have to be satisfied with his slightly manic bad guy in this one, 'cause he's really good in it.
I'd actually forgotten though, since the last time I saw this, how much great fun it is. Also, despite what one reviewer said about it being a perfect guy movie, well, it's good for everyone who loves mayhem, explosions, wit, great production values and Steve Buscemi.

"We've seen it before, and just the way I like it.","My Take: An action-packed guilty pleasure action movie loaded with thrills.Try DIE HARD meets AIRPORT with several elements borrowed from FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX, THE DELTA FORCE and SPEED and you got the idea behind CON AIR, a completely implausible but nonetheless entertaining action adventure team-up with producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Simon West (in his directorial debut). It's not exactly art, but then again that may guarantee that's pure not-to-be-taken-seriously fun.The plot concerns the hijacking of a prisoner transport plane by one of the nastiest criminals on the planet, led by Cyrus ""The Virus"" Grissom (John Malkovich). The rest of the passengers read like a who's who of the criminally insane, like the cast of AIRPORT in hell. We have black militant leader (played by Ving Rhames), a Hannibal Lecter-like psychopath (Steve Buscemi), a rapist (Danny Trejo), a loudmouthed black stereotype/comic relief (Dave Chapelle) and down to a transvestite inmate and all mass murderers as far as the eye could see. Back on the ground, US Marshal Vince Larkin (John Cusack) must rely on paroled ex-convict Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) to cease control of the plane. With already such a cast, I was expecting George Kennedy to show up somewhere.Part of the fun is seeing who the movie plays with several clichés of the genre. The clichés are age-old, some dating back to the days of AIRPORT with such a big all star cast (but this time, mostly with character actors). At some point, Cusack tells Cage that ""he's at the wrong place at the wrong time"", which will immediately remind anyone of DIE HARD. CON AIR is not exactly strong with plot, with an ending in Las Vegas that could only be described as implausible. (Plus, after all the action, the movie even has time for Trisha Yearwood to warble the theme song ""How Do I Live"") Not that it matters, the whole film is not exactly art but it's loads of fun, and I'd be damned if I say I wasn't entertained.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Quite bad!,"Awful and ridiculously overrated, just a stupid frentic action and explosions anaesthesia. Kitsch aesthetics, bad soundtrack, unconvincing script, confusing and too chopped edition (looks like a Michael Bay flick)... There are several technical problems, but the movie is also bad for other reasons. It is a law and order propaganda developped to frighten people about criminals (including some vile policemen does not change that bias, and probably showing their williness to torture will have no negative impact on spectators who want criminals to be beaten and killed). Presenting a black activist (from an organization which name ressembles a little the black panthers) as one of the most hideous men there and a partner of serial killers, rapists and psychipaths was a particularly disgusting sin.

Manipulation can be lucrative,"In Hollywood, ""high-concept"" triumphed over creativity and quirkiness long ago, and it's no wonder that ""Con Air"" has joined the pantheon of mindless escapism that pushes all the right buttons to please a lowbrow audience.When this was released I found it condescending and hokey, but that's beside the point. Bruckheimer took the caper movie template and reduces it to silly crowd-pleaser shtick. Hack writer and hack director complete the formula -checking IMDb it's hardly surprising that over the hill scribe Rosenberg is (or at least was) working on a Dirty Dozen remake for producer Joel Silver.

For every honest, decent, honorable person who has studied martial arts for the respectable purpose of self-defense, Con Air presents a realistic scenario of how everything can go wrong for the law-abiding citizen who defends himself.For starters, the laws of this nation defining 'self defense' have long been established by lawyer politicians and judges who never studied self-defense and more, have never been in a self-defense situation. It's possible a few have served in the military but that doesn't mean they experienced combat. Therefore the laws defining what the law-abiding citizen can and cannot do have been written by politicians who harbored only a vague sense of what legal self-defense should be. They never took into account just how fast and chaotic any life-and-death self-defense situation can be and the victim is not always in the position to determine just what constitutes enough self-defense that a 'reasonable' person would be expected to commit. This term, 'reasonable' and 'reasonable of amount of force' comes up repeatedly in the laws defining self-defense and deliberately cultivates an element of subjective uncertainty that is left up to the jury and judge to decide. The victim is still considered to be a law-abiding citizen and therefore is subject to strict compliance with the subjective laws of self-defense while the criminal aggressor of course is free to use whatever means of violence he chooses. Also bear in mind that the politicians and judges who framed our nation's laws of self-defense; many, not all, greatly disdained violent responses to personal attack because to them it broke the laws of civilization, introduced the law of the jungle and regressed society to the Old West frontier. While you can't pass laws restricting the criminal's violent crime they could pass laws restricting the law-abiding citizen's ability to defend himself.The set-up in Con Air is pretty stereotypical. Decent man, former US Army ranger, Cameron Poe, celebrates his return home with his beautiful wife in a local bar. And there's the stereotype villain, an obnoxious, drunk, horny, local white lowlife, dressing, looking, and speaking the part. And he has two, silent, lowlife buddies with him to give him courage. Drunk white trash lowlife makes obnoxious, lewd comments to Poe and his wife. Poe and wife put down the idiot and do the right thing, leave the dive. Since the white trash drunk lowlife has two buddies with him, he feels invincible in deciding to thrash the impertinent, clean-shaven Army boy, and maybe get in some rape fun with his wife. Well, that's how it is with bullies, isn't it? They always need to have a couple of guys backing them up. Had the slob been alone, he may have thought twice about going out in the rain to confront Poe (Nicholas Cage). Now the laws of self-defense in almost every state declare that Poe and wife retreat from the scene but it doesn't look like they have much opportunity to do so. A guy by himself could try to duck and run but with a woman on his arm that's out of the question, unless he plans on leaving her behind. As might be expected, the lowlife takes a sucker punch swing at Poe, who, counterattacks with fast, well-placed military combatives hand strikes, one of which, the palm heel strike to the nose, kills the lowlife. His two buddies immediately desert the scene.At the trial comes the nightmare. You hear nothing from Poe's lawyer, who stands silently like a store mannequin ten feet away from Poe as if he had some communicable disease. You get the sense Poe's defense lawyer was worthless to a tee. Then comes the judge who immediately shows his left-wing liberal views on self-defense by declaring Poe the aggressor and the criminal, simply because he had military combatives training and, ""...should have known better."" Should have known better, what? How was Poe to know? Men have died from a single punch to the face/head from an untrained assailant and it's happened twice in southern California over the past five years. During a fracas at local baseball park in southern California, a normal, healthy 5'10"" man took a punch in the face from another fan. The man collapsed and died two days later.Now the laws of self-defense being what they are, when you kill someone in self-defense, a lot has to go into consideration. Typically killing an assailant armed with a deadly weapon usually (hopefully) ends with no prison time provided there was no escape option for the victim. Most of the time these situations involved house break-ins with armed burglars. But out in the street, fist-to-fist, it gets murkier. Killing someone in what the judge considers a bar brawl is not self-defense in his mind. You might blame the defense lawyer for not being eloquent or persuasive enough with the judge and jury. When you kill someone in a fistfight often the law declares you guilty of negligent homicide, be it manslaughter or second degree homicide. So you are going to jail. But the jail term should not be as long as Poe received, ten years. The judge could have sentenced him to three years to seven years. With time off for good behavior, Poe could have been out of jail in as little as 18 months to 3 years. Poe would still be vulnerable to a wrongful death lawsuit from the dead man's relatives but that's another worst case scenario.As you contemplate self-defense, know from the experts that it is chaotic, unscripted and thousand things can go wrong. But in the split seconds that you have, you take the risk, especially as in Poe's case, he could have been badly injured, even killed by three men, with the possibility of his wife been sexually assaulted afterwards, which in this movie was a distinct possibility given the lust the drunk lowlife exhibited to Poe's wife.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Big explosions and dopey dialogue. May work better as a drinking game...,"Like Face / Off, Con Air works best when you don't think too hard about what you are watching, though it must be said that the first 2/3 of the film are pretty good – if formulaic.Nic Cage is returned serviceman Cameron Poe, home to see his pregnant wife who works as a waitress, after a spell away – the fact that his wife is pregnant means he was either stationed for far less than 9 months (she wasn't even ""showing"" upon his return) or that perhaps he might have cause to wonder how she picks up her tips In any case on the first night some local hicks poke fun at Poe, then confront him in the car park where a fight breaks out. In dispatching his three assailants Poe accidentally kills one of them, leading to a trial and a sentence of 7 – 10 years.Welcome home.Poe ends up serving 8 years and is due for parole. While behind bars he wiles away the time improving himself, working out, writing hokey letters to wife and daughter and growing a bad-ass redneck mullet – according to the montage we are shown anyway.If that wasn't ""Awww shucks"" enough his day of release coincides with his daughter's birthday, and seeing Poe didn't want his daughter to see him in a cage this will be their first meeting.Don't worry I'm sure there will be absolutely no hiccups.Poe is scheduled to board a plane that will take him home to be released, only it happens to also be transporting some of the most seriously deranged and violent criminals to a newly created facility to house ""the worst of the worst"". This gives Vince Larkin (John Cusack) good reason to list the various body counts and worst aspects of the inmates, who have names like Diamond Dog (Ving Rhames), Pinball (Dave Chappelle), Johnny 23 (Danny Trejo) and Cyrus ""the Virus"" (John Malkovich).As a special matter a Drug Enforcement Agency operative will be boarding undercover as a prisoner to try to uncover information from one of the inmates – this is at the behest of the DEA boss Molloy (Colm Meaney), though in reality Molloy's character only exists to provide friction between he and Larkin, and to make bad decisions to allow Larkin to fix them in heroic fashion.Once aboard it takes all of 14 seconds for the locked up criminals to undo months of prevention and security planning and take over the plane. The only thing between them and freedom is a routine stop to drop off and pick up more inmates (including meek looking mass-murderer Garland Green who gets the full Hannibal Lector treatment) if all goes according to plan they are then on the way to freedom.This stop necessitates the drop of some inmates. Now the ideal scenario would see Poe volunteer to leave the plane, thus removing himself from the situation so he can make his release in time and see his family, but Because Poe isn't really a criminal – after all he only killed one little guy with his bare hands! – and as his buddy on the plane is diabetic and there is a female guard (Rachel Ticotin) that he worries about, he chooses to stay aboard.To this point the film was only very far-fetched, now however the fun starts and the film loses whatever fragile grip on reality that it previously enjoyed, devolving into a mess of plot-holes and one ""REALLY?"" moment after another.Shortly after the plane once again takes off the good guys on the ground realise that they are no longer in control of matters. Might I point out though that no-one seems to have a radar to see the plane, they only follow the transponder that was once in the plane – seeing as how satellites can now read the numbers on our mailboxes from space I feel that their inability to locate the real plane was baffling. (I know this was over a decade ago but I know they had pretty good radar equipment even back then!) Anyway in between the gun battles, explosions and macho talk that includes some gems as:""I said, put the bunny back in the box!"" and""I drove through three states wearing her head as a hat."" John Malkovich lends credibility and genuine menace as Cyrus the Virus and John Cusack tries in vain to make the Larkin character work as the voice of reason, though if you consider most of his arguments with Molloy and his own boss his suggestions and protests are often plain wrong.There is a creepy ""Well did he"" subplot involving a young girl which seemed unnecessary in a mindless shoot 'em up and the longer the movie goes the more ludicrous and laughable it all becomes.Final Rating – 5.5 / 10. Another ""don't think"" film, if you just enjoy the pretty explosions then Con Air has a couple moments, not enough to suggest that you seek it out unless you want a good movie for a drinking game.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Bruckheimer meets the Coens,"Yes, far-fetched, loose, bonkers, ridiculous and knows it for the most part. It's the usual Bruckheimer exploding stuff colored by someone who has known the Coens as simply those quirky guys. Malkovich threatens to kill a bunny. A body falls from the sky, smack dab on normalcy.But just about its best quality is how pliant.Just as you might settle for an elaborate hostage situation, we're already wandering about where to land. Just as you might expect a protracted anxiety about the death toll of landing in Vegas, we're already blithely plowing through casinos. It always moves faster through its sets than the equivalent Die Hard movie would, which was the established staple of this type then.Cage stops just short of channeling his Sailor/HI persona and goes the Bruckheimer route of action hero. But it's still Cage at the time when he was the best possible version of himself, feeling the most comfortable in his skin, cockiness that moves through the whole body.",,Anonymous,Crime
Welcome To Con Air!,"US Ranger Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage)returns home to Alabama to see his wife Tricia (Monica Potter). Poe has trouble with some of the locals and does his best to try to ignore the troublemakers. After he leaves the bar, the men spot Poe outside and start beating him up, but Poe fights back and ends up unintentionally killing one of the men. As a result of his actions, Poe is sentenced to 7 to 10 years in a state penitentiary. Poe becomes eligible for parole and boards a plane with various convicts who are being transported on the aircraft for varying reasons. However, some of the convicts have plotted an escape attempt and hold the guards and air crew hostage. Poe's conscience will not allow him to sit by and do nothing and he does everything he can to try and stop them.Con Air isn't entirely original and shares many of its plot elements with Air Force One. Despite this though, the story isn't actually too bad. Despite the fact that Poe is a convict here, he isn't an animal like many of the others on board - he has morals and a conscience and it does mean that it's very easy to get behind Poe and his fight against the convicts. The film flows very well and for the most part the script is actually pretty good - we all know that the convicts are going to hi-jack the plane, but it can be fun sometimes to see how they're going to do it and it's clear that some thought had been put into the script. As with most action films there are plenty of wisecracks, some tongue-in-cheek humour, and the film also has a sense of menace about it which are all essential ingredients for a good action film.The film is very well-paced and mercifully has no real padding or silly sub plots and stays very much focused on Poe trying to save the day (which was fine with me). The performances from the main cast are variable; Nic Cage is OK when he's called upon to do anything physical, but lacks any real charisma meaning that he gets by here on his likability. Monica Potter is cute, but rather bland. Malkovich is the star of the show and seems to have a lot of fun hamming it up here. He knows exactly what film he's in and really throws himself into the role. Rhames is good here too, but is very much playing second fiddle to Malkovich. Colm Meaney and John Cusack are also good in supporting roles.Director Simon West stages the action well and once again serves up pretty much everything we come to expect from an action film. The final sequence of events was pretty exciting and overall I was fairly impressed with this film.Con Air has everything I look for in an action film; a sense of fun, wise-cracks, tongue-in-cheek humour, a fast pace, a reasonable story and a trace of menace about it. If these are the sorts of things that you look for in an action film then you certainly won't be disappointed with this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

It's almost like he didn't even belong in this movie. Ving Rhames and John Malkovich are also pretty good.I don't think Con Air is a great movie. In fact, I don't think it's even a good movie. As a matter of fact I think it's terrible, with dumb dialogue, way too many explosions and one liners for its own good and Nicolas Cage overacting at its best. But it's hilarious, it's awesome.

A lot of action but very little else.,"Con air is one of those films that actually requires you not to think at all. Because if you do you'll just end up questioning its content; dialogue, plot, everything.But hey, this is a movie, it's Hollywood man, it's not even trying to be original or feel real. It just want to give 100% action and it does deliver.The story is simple and nothing talk about really. A lot of bad guys escape while being transfered from one prison to another with an airplane called ""Con Air"". This is, of course, a perfect excuse for spectacular explosions, shootouts, men going to pieces, cars burning, stuff flying around with total disregard of gravity etc. etc.A thing I enjoyed about it is that it has two of my favourite supporting actors in it: Steve Buscemi and Colm Meany, Buscemi is entertaining as a total psycho. But the acting don't get a big part here, and maybe it shouldn't. It's just one spectacular scene after another, which is fun if you're in the right mood for it.

At no point was i bored! this is quite something for me. normally if the first 5 seconds of a film don't please i wonder off and get something to eat. But here it was a different case. i liked where the film was going right from the very beginning. i think unlike some films the characters were developed on very well. you knew more than they were convicts. you knew about their backgrounds and what they had done. and generally about there mental stability. the star of the film, Nicholas cage, pulls it off very well. he puts on a very nice hillbilly accent and acts quite tough for the duration. sure some of his lines and actions may have been corny but i liked it never the less.i think overall it is a good film and one i will buy, and watch many times.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Something Is Missing,"CON AIR has a good enough premise to make the audience forget about some rather obvious plot holes like the good guy Cameron Poe getting sent down on a manslaughter charge ( It was self defence and no one in America would be convicted of defending themself especially if it`s a serviceman against a red neck scum bag ) , but there`s something missing from the movie that stops it being a classic action thriller which is a great pity because I do remember seeing the trailers and thinking CON AIR would be worth watching . Ah maybe that`s the problem ? All the good bits are used in the trailers !Yup that`s what`s missing - enough substance to make this movie enjoyable for its full duration . In fact when you stop to examine the script it contains next to no substance whatsoever , it`s a simple contrived tale of a good guy being in the wrong place at the wrong time saving the day and watch out for some clumsy scripting where it looks like there`s a traitor amongst the feds and this becomes quickly forgotten about by the end of the film . Nicholas Cage is an under rated actor but I doubt if he has what it takes to be an action movie star ( But after seeing Steven Segal and Jean Claude Van Damme that`s by no means a criticism ) and I found his Elvis Pressley type mannerisms rather grating . Likewise John Malkovich is seriously miscast as the main baddie but I guess Gary Oldman would be a too obvious casting choice and being a Jerry Bruckheimer production the real stars are the explosions and stunt sequencesI wanted to like CON AIR a lot but it`s spoiled by its shallow blockbuster roots",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

He should have put the bunny back in the box.,"A lot of 'Con Air (1997)' doesn't make sense if you stop and think about it, but you're not supposed to stop and think about it. You kind of get the sense that the picture is aware of its own absurdity, even if it never explicitly states it, which allows it to feel as though it's 'in on the joke' (despite not necessarily aiming for funny). It's basically just a tongue-in-cheek action flick that sees a seemingly average man come up against heavy odds in a confined space, yet another variation on the formula perfected by 'Die Hard (1988)'. It does pretty much exactly what you expect it to and - while it certainly isn't going to win any awards - it's a lot of fun while it's underway. That's the most important thing when it comes to stuff like this. It's an enjoyable, typically well-paced affair that often makes you smile. I mean, who doesn't want to see Nic Cage - complete with flowing locks, toned muscles and a southern drawl - tell a grown man to put a bunny back in a box? 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""Con Air"" won't let you take it too seriously","In the era of the gritty blockbuster actioner, tongue in cheek action has become a lost art in Hollywood. 1997's ""Con Air"" resides between the tongue-in-cheek heyday of the '80s and the explosive realism of today, but it certainly leans toward the former.Nicolas Cage stars as Cameron Poe, an Army Ranger who immediately after returning home to Alabama gets in a brawl with some drunks that turns deadly. He lands in prison, having to wait eight years to finally see his wife and the daughter he's never met. But when parole day finally arrives, his lift home comes in the form of a U.S. marshal max-security aircraft transporting the country's most dangerous criminals. When they manage to overtake the plane, Cameron proves to be the only one capable of thwarting them.""Con Air"" takes much delight in its concept. Screenwriter Scott Rosenberg gleefully crafts an array of criminal characters that are absolute freaks, but not without a large degree of self- awareness as to their rotten nature. Equipped with absurd nicknames such as Cyrus ""The Virus"" Grissom and Johnny-23 (23 being the number of women he's been convicted of raping), these villains strike a balance between formidable and not to be taken too seriously.John Malkovich leads the way as Cyrus, a ""learned"" convict who educated himself in prison. Malkovich has fun with his typical over-enunciation and patented snide tone, making him the ideal cliché mastermind. Ving Rhames plays his right hand and physical compliment, Diamond Dog, a black supremacist of sorts. The other convicts receive boatloads of personality and the script hypes them up ahead of time. Steve Buscemi's Garland ""The Marietta Mangler"" Greene even gets the Hannibal Lecter treatment ... yup, Steve Buscemi.These nut jobs actually make a lion-mained Cage speaking in an awful Southern accent seem totally normal. As ripped as he's ever been in his career, Cage makes for a convincing action hero, though his real strength turns out to be how flips countless one-liners into enjoyable movie quotes. Cage seems to know exactly what kind of a movie he's in and never flinches. Few actors can say the line ""put the bunny back in the box"" with a straight face and get away with it. Cage has always had that gift.Director Simon West keeps the tone light, but that doesn't mean he also eases up the on the action. ""Con Air"" has a pretty relentless motor and all of its major sequences feel as though they could be the climactic showdown. It could've ended an hour in and been effectively entertaining, so everything in the final hour feels like a bonus. The degree of explosions does get to an absurd level by the end, but that's part of the film's charm.To some extent, there does feel like a wasted opportunity to create an intense self-contained action thriller aboard the plane. One man trying to stop a plane hijacked by horrific convicts has plenty of potential, but the plane lands three times in the movie, plus John Cusack's character, Larkin, plays the U.S. marshal trying to rectify the disaster and keep an over- zealous DEA agent (Colm Meaney) from jeopardizing his plan.Helping us stay invested in the outcome is the desire to see Cameron and his daughter meet for the first time. The film spends not 10 minutes setting up the ""relationship"" between the two (Cameron's lone motivation) in hopes we'll care and somehow we do. Care too much, however, and you start to wonder how a guy on parole gets stuck taking a plane full of the worst of the worst and why at one point he elects not to take an easy out. Those are not questions worth wondering.A lot of action films struggle to cross the border from ridiculous and stupid to tongue in cheek and facetious, but ""Con Air"" is one of them. From the story to West down to the actors, there's an unspoken acknowledgement of exactly what kind of a movie this is and together they churn out one of the '90s finest guilty pleasure action films.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"Ladies and Gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. I have the only gun on board. Welcome to Con Air.","Hummingbird Humdinger.Con Air is directed by Simon West and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. It stars Nicolas Cage, John Cusack and John Malkovich. Plot sees Cameron Poe (Cage), a parolee on his way home to his wife and daughter after serving years in prison for manslaughter. He's travelling on a plane full of the most dangerous criminals currently being held in America, they are being transferred to some new super prison. Inevitably something goes wrong and the cons take over the plane, with only Poe standing between them and freedom.No doubt about it, Con Air is one of the most over the top action film's you are ever likely to see. But it knows it is, it embraces it - and positively revels in it. What we have is a bunch of sicko's and psycho's on a plane, their roll call of crimes as gargantuan as the excess of explosions and quips are. Down on the ground are a frantic John Cussack and an angry Colm Meaney, the play off between the two almost as funny as the shenanigans on the plane - where characters called Billy Bedlam (Nick Chinlund), Cyrus The Virus (Malkovich) & The Marietta Mangler (Steve Buscemi) push mania to a new level.Enter director West, who clearly under orders from Bruckheimer, unleashes a barrage of explosive set pieces, each one more outrageous than the last. It's neatly edited and paced like a good action movie should be. There's also no small amount of tension to sidle along side the white knuckle thrills. As Cage strips down to his Bruce Willis vest we have a real likable hero to get on side with, yes it's played tongue in cheek, very much so, but his character has been so well written by Scott Rosenberg we really forgive the ridiculousness of each heroic act. Also along the for the ride are Ving Rhames, Danny Trejo, M.C.

"great action,decent story,and comic relief from the master(Steve Buscemi)","this is another action packed thrill ride,though i didn't like it as much as ""The Rock"" another action adventure thrill ride which came out the year previous.Nic Cage stars in both of these movies,though in ""Con Air"",Cage is the main focus,whereas ""The Rock"" was an ensemble cast.any way,in this movie(Con Air)Cage is the lead star and the the main action hero,though he does have some help.the action scenes in this movie are great,though not always believable.there is also a semblance of a story which we are told near the beginning of the film.this sets up the action nicely.there are some big names in this movie,including John Cusack ,John Malkovich, Ving Rames, and Colm Meany.Danny Trejo puts in a very good performance,as well.but it's Steve Buscemi who provides the comic relief,in his usual wry, sardonic way.but,like i said,it's Nic Cage that takes centre stage as the action hero,and he is very credible in my opinion.before i forget,i must mention that the movie also has some dramatic moments which work good.i also like the soundtrack.i thought it suited the movie very well.overall,i liked this movie lot and would recommend it for action fans.i give ""Con Air"" 8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

However, he is nonetheless one of the main, and key characters in this action flick.John Cusack, actually, one of John's best acting performances, really I haven't seen a great John Cusack movie ever, however, with these set of actors he actually puts on a very suspenseful drama induced part, of an FBI agent.Steve Buscemi, he adds to the motley crew of killers and rapists that all happen to be on this airplane. He is in fact a very smart and intellectual killer, but he is said to be psychotic.What makes this movie so great is its simplicity, yet complexity. It's a very simple theme, however, the cast of characters that were casted for this movie is just so diverse that it makes this simplistic theme a drama ridden tale.After watching this movie you sadly won't be any smarter, or no anything more about the world.

Con air is another great die hard film but the movie is good thanks to Nicolas Cage. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Fairly Entertaining Action Film,"This film is really pretty good for what it is. Since it's about a recently-released prisoner on his way home when prisoners seize control of the prisoner-transport plane he's in, it's a relatively unusual action film. The relatively unique setting (it's kind if like Die HArd in a general way only) and plot have potential, with Cage's character trying to solve the situation in the air whilst cops on the ground try to handle it there. And, for the most part the film uses the potential well. There's action, tension, and drama, and the momentum keeps up throughout.That said, of course the film has some failings. Some themes and elements are well-trod and even clichéd while parts of the whole things are rather implausible, and in some parts the story has not handled very smoothly.One other point is that some people don't like the range of characters, especially among the criminals, and think that the film tried to do too much. I think, however, that all of this added to the film. Although the number of singular characters does prevent much exploration of each one, that is not something to be expected in a film such as this and it is not a very significant problem. Thus, the variety of characters increased the film's depth and the range of entertainment value, added to the realism and tension, heightening the mistrust, etc., among some of the prisoners, and it provided some more rich characters with personality. Some claim that Buscemi's much-feared serial-killer character was superfluous, but I find him a great addition in part because he's a relatively complex and interesting character and he provides a very different aspect to the lot of criminals on the plane. The fact that the other criminals kept him tied up because they thought he was just a dangerous nut case, while in the end he ends up coming off as much more intelligent and less savage than they is a fun and interesting spot in the film. This is heightened by the fact that he appears to be the only prisoner who escapes, which adds more fun irony to the film.Could this film have been better? Yes, it could have been much better if different themes were introduced, characters handled differently, etc,., but as it was it is still a pretty good film for what it is.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Every character is overblown, every scene charged with organizational and procedural errors, and the lack of intervention by higher authorities is outrageous.

So much better than typical action movies nowadays.,"While certainly it is an entertaining film, is not as good as other over-the-top action flicks of the 90s, Air Force One and Face Off come to mind.
While some one-liners remain classic, some others are just ridiculous. Nic Cage is just Nic Cage, he is kinda hard to take seriously in some of the movies he stars in, but he was acceptable in this. John Cusack and John Malkovich really pull their characters off. I believe the 90s continued a trend with action flicks, that may have started in the 80s and continue today with such unrealistic unplausible plots that somehow the heros magically save the day at the last minute. It all comes down to a greasy machine that keeps manufacturing these overproduced audiovisual pieces just for the sake of a genre, without providing something different to the formula. Well, at least movies like Con Air have a nostalgic element to it that decidely throws in an extra charm. And if you watched it in the 90s and you watch it now in 2019, you obviously realize it hasn't aged well, but it is still highly entertaining and not as bad as you recall. It's actually decent.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Timeless 90's action,"As a highly decorated former U. S. Army ranger Cameron Poe has always been a man of action sometimes finding himself on the wrong end of certain situations. After one druken altercation Poe is sent to the federal pen on a seven year sentence for something most would consider not wrong but unfortunate. Finally up for Parloe Poe is anxious to get home to his wife and to finally meet his daughter who was born while he was behind bars. Poe now boarding the prison transport aircraft, the Jailbird, and once they arrive at destination he is a free man. It just so happens that the plane is also boarding some of the most famous & most dangerous convicts not on the way to parole like Poe. One specific convict known as Cyrus ""The Virus"" has a different set of plans in motion to take-over and hijack the plane with the help of the other high profile criminals on board in order to re-route the Jailbird to an alternate airfield to escape incarceration. Cameron Poe has never been a man to not do any and everything to protect his country no matter the personal consequences thus including these would-be hijakers. It's up to Poe to shake off the rust(not difficult), with the help of a certain U. S. Marshal to thwart the ""The Virus"" and his plan for escape at any cost.This film is 90's action in its ultimate form. Sure it's ludicrous but in the best ways, big guns, bad guys, explosions, quips, a one man wrecking ball, and of corse more explosions. The films cast is highly impressive, quite an eclectic collection of stars the kind of cast you really don't see done so well In movies anymore. Cage is exceptional here, a real mans man, a total badass. The type of character Cyrus The Virus, is awkwardly cagey but none less dangerous and I simply don't see anyone pulling it off the way Malkovich does, he was superb. Even the supporting cast have some star power in their own rights, Buscemi, Trejo, Cusack, & the list goes on. The soundtrack oozes 90's movies and the cinematography is impressively polished. I may be a sucker for anything action but in my opinion Con Air is certainly a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Big, loud and not too bright","Con Air follows in the tradition of most Bruckheimer films - it's flashy,oversized and contains more explosions per minute than Dresden in WWII. The ilm contains a number of interesting characters - Cusack's Marshall Larkin and a number of the villains (notably Malkovich as a thoroughly engaging psychopath and Buscemi as - well, an even more engaging wackjob) are especially interesting, but most of the talent in the film is wasted because someone upped the budget on explosives but forgot to include summary raises in intelligence.Yes, the film's worth seeing once or twice. It's visually entertaining (and often almost ludicrously so) and features some well-choreographed action scenes, but can't stand up to repeated viewing. You quickly realize that most of the movie is boorish and many of the characters - mostly the villains, sadly - are hackneyed and cliche.Cage's leading role is especially disappointing, though the fault lies in the writing rather than his portrayal. The script makes his Army Ranger out as a soulless creation of the military, a man without any emotion - unless you decide to mess with his family, in which case he gets rather angry. He's shown as devoted to friends and something of a crusading hero, but there's barely enough development to give us an inkling of why he's the way he is. If you want to see convincing Army Rangers, go pick up a copy of Saving Private Ryan and check out actual humans in the military. For some reason, ""Con Air""'s writers decided to take more of a ""Terminator"" approach, but at the same time make us like and identify with Cage's role. I'm not buying it.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"It's so 90s, but in the best way possible","Nicolas Cage plays Cameron Poe, a former US Army Ranger, who has been locked up behind bars for years after he accidentally killed a man while defending his wife. But now he's about to be freed. There's only the last remaining prisoner transport flight left. What could go wrong?The whole idea of Con Air is ludicrous. You have all these over the top bad guys in one airplane. Each of them almost worthy of joining Batman's Rogues Gallery. And then you have the one good guy, who just happens to be there by pure luck and it's up to him to save the day. But you know what, it works. Perhaps I'm more forgiving because it is from the 90s or perhaps they simply knew how to make these plots work back then. Nevertheless, in Con Air the ludicrous tone is a source of strength, not a hindrance.Especially when it comes to John Malkovich. He plays a character named Cyrus the Virus. What a great name and what a great performance. It shouldn't work. This sleazy, smarmy, snobbish piece of over-articulating rhetoric shouldn't work. But in Malkovich's hands it just flows so naturally. Because it's Malkovich.I also like Cage's odd accent. I like Steve Buscemi's completely nonsensical and distracting character performance. I like the clichédness of John Cusack and Colm Meaney's characters. I like the stunts.What I don't like is the completely unnecessary fourth act after one of the best ending action scenes I've seen in a while.

Con Air A Well Made Action Adventure With Solid Performances,"Con Air is a well made action adventure with solid performances by the cast including Nicolas Cage, John Cusuak, John Malcovich, Steve Buscemi, and Ving Rhames. Director Simon West does an admirable job of making Con Air giving audiences for the most part what they come to except from these type of movies. Nicolas Cage is excellent as Cameron Poe an ex-con and former ranger who finds himself trapped in a prisoner transport plane when the passengers seize control. John Cusuak is equally impressive as US Marshal Vince Larkin who joins Cameron in an attempt to stop the dangerous criminals who have taken over the plane. John Malcovich is great as the main villain Cyrus ""The Virus"" Grissom whose the leader of the criminals. Steve Buscemi is solid as Garlin Greene another psychopath who is brought into the plane in restraints when you first meet him before being set free. Ving Rhames is perfect for Nathan ""Diamond Dog"" Jones one of the dangerous criminals working with Grissom. The rest of the cast including Monica Potter, Dave Chappelle, MC Gainey, Danny Trejo, Mykelti Williamson, Rachel Ticotin, Nick Chinlund, and Colm Meaney are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The action/fight sequences, the chases, and explosions are well executed. Despite some flaws with the film juggling too many characters, development, and a rushed finale.

But that's kind of my gut reaction to this movie - basically a good ride (I remember seeing it a couple times in the cinema), but, wow, not anything that should ever be referenced as 'good'.Scenery-chewing (in a good way) by John Malkovich, Ving Rhames and Steve Buscemi give this movie what entertainment value it has. All three ham up their performances with the director's (and the audience's) blessing, and clearly had a lot of fun doing this. I can't blame them, as it probably was.Nicholas Cage competes strongly with Dick Van Dyke in the 'Worst On-Screen Accent of All Time' category, with an Alabama drawl that makes me feel like someone's working my cerebellum with a cheese-grater.John Cusack is slapped in the background, even during scenes in which he's talking. His entire performance is straight-to-cable, and is possibly the biggest downer - we all know he (unlike Cage) could be doing a lot better.The first ten minutes of the movie are swallowed by a gaping plot-hole, in order to get Nick Cage ('a really good guy, with some lethal training') aboard Con Air, surrounded by all the evil in the universe. Clearly not comfortable with making him an anti-hero (which would have been infinitely preferable), we're instead stuck watching a pre-credit buildup that stretches one's benign disbelief to the breaking point.On the positive side, it gets a bonus point for having rocket launchers.

The first act kicks off with a solid character buildup-short but effective-and the second act ramps up the tension, keeping it steady all the way to the end.The acting is top-notch, with a star-studded cast that truly delivers. Nicolas Cage holds his own in the lead role, but the ensemble cast, packed with some of Hollywood's finest, really shines. Each performance adds to the intensity and fun of the film.Cinematography isn't groundbreaking, but it does the job, letting the action take center stage without distraction. What really stands out is the script-it's surprisingly layered in certain scenes, offering more depth than your typical action flick.Overall, Con Air balances great performances, tension, and an unexpectedly thoughtful script, making it a must-watch for any action movie fan.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

The casting for this movie was excellent -- John Malkovich is utterly convincing as the socio-pathic Cyrus the Virus, and Nicolas Cage is brilliant as the laconic ex-ranger.

Con Air,"This takes forever to get going, but once the plot gets the establishing twenty minutes out of the way, it's actually quite a decent adventure story. Ranger Nicolas Cage (""Poe"") gets embroiled in a fatal brawl that lands him in jail. Out on his parole, he gets caught up in a highly sophisticated prison break planned by ""Cyrus"" (John Malkovich) - intent on hijacking their prison flight and executing a complicated onwards escape plan before the pursuing Colm Meaney (""Agent. Malloy"") and an heavily armed squad of soldiers track them down. Luckily for Cage, and the authorities, John Cusack (""Agent Larkin"") is on hand to help guide in the Feds as time marches on, and Cage's predicament becomes even more precarious. Malkovich makes for quite a good scheming baddie; there is plenty of action, a little bit of humour, pyrotechnics and the last half hour consists of pretty decent, entertaining, end-to-end stuff. Nothing remotely cerebral, but it's still an enjoyable film that finds a use for a snow plough in the desert! Soundtrack is quite good, too.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

The stuff that action movie dreams are made of,"Nicolas Cage Week: Day 7Con Air is as loud and dumb as action movies get, so much so that I'm surprised Michael Bay had nothing to do with it. Instead its helmed by Simon West, with explosive support from producers Jerry Bruckheimer and notoriously bawdy Don Simpson. It's a big sloppy kiss for action movie fans, and a right good time at the movies. In case I get called out for focusing more on Nic's more shallow genre stuff during this week, keep in mind there's one more film that I left out on account of a special video project that myself and a good friend are cooking up this weekend. But I am aware of his artsier stuff like Adaptation as well, just haven't gotten around to them yet. Anyway.. back to Con Air. Cage plays stoic navy SEAL Cameron Poe, who accidentally kills a scumbag (Waingro.. I mean Kevin Gage) who really, really asked for it. He's sent to the clink on manslaughter charges and awaits his return to his wife (Monica Potter♡) and young daughter whose birth he missed. Just his luck though, as the transport plane that is to carry him home at the end of his senteance is also home to the meanest, nastiest, most psychopathic bunch of convicts that US Corrections could dig up, making him pretty nervous. As anyone who's seen the trailer can guess, the inmates take over the plane and all kinds of fiery, high octane hell breaks loose thousands of feet above the ground. Cage is left to contend with the worst of the worst...These guys are really bad. How bad? Danny Trejo stands out as 'Johnny 23', who's got 23 heart tattoos, for each of the women he's raped. ""They'd call me Johnny 600 if they knew the truth"" he sneers. Ugh. Snarling, volatile Billy Bedlam (Nick Chinlund) slaughtered his wife and her family, even the dog. Hannibal Lecter esque Garland Greene (Steve Buscemi) committed countless atrocities, which he reminisces about like he's ordering lunch. The leader of the pack, Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom (John Malkovich, hysterical) claims to have killed more people than cancer. It's a trashy, unapologetic flick, but it's endlessly fun as well. Poe races to control the situation, while US Marshal Vince Larkin (John Cusack) struggles to get things under control on the ground. There's some impressive sequences, including a desert explosion and lot of bloody antics on the plane. The climax erupts into a massive car chase through downtown Las Vegas that's so incredibly chaotic and ridiculous that one has to admire the filmmakers own commitment to pure reckless abandon lol. The supporting cast is stacked too, including Ving Rhames, Dave Chapelle, Don S. Davis, Mykelti Williamson, Rachel Ticotin, Powers Boothe, M.C. Gainey and a priceless turn from a blustery Colm Meaney, getting all the best lines (in reference to Cusack's character ""He's probably recycling his sandals to save the amazon or something""). This is definitely check your brain in at the door territory. Sit back, have a beer and enjoy the near comic book over the top aesthetic of this classic headbanger.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Nonlinear action sequences + Weak Plot + Jerry B. = Bad movie,"Jerry Bruckheimer. He has a way of turning every movie he produces into s---, such as Black Hawk Down, although that was still good it could've been great if Ridley Scott was free to do as he pleased. Okay, now for this movie. The premise is somewhat interesting since it has never been tried before. The cast looks worthy, good actors such as Cage, Buscemi, and Malkovich. The execution is just plain bad. Instead of being a somewhat intelligent movie about its characters such as The Rock it becomes a mindless action film. It doesn't even have enough action to be called an action film. It tries to be dramatic and funny but utterly fails. Cage is all right here, he doesn't have much to act out. Buscemi is okay too, he doesn't do that much. Malkovich is too stereotypical, watch him in Being John Malkovich and In the Line of Fire. The ending was so pathetic with that song all of a sudden starting, it was such a sharp contrast to the overall feel of the film. That song even got nominated for an Academy Award (seriously, this is the first time it was played??) The wife and kid of Cage were really annoying, I wanted them to leave him alone. Overall, this is a stereotypical film with a weak plot and bad action. The only reason I give this above a one is because of a rare memorable action scene or a good joke. 4/10",,Anonymous,Crime
A Turbulent Thrill Ride That Soars High,"In the realm of high-octane action flicks, ""Con Air"" stands as a testament to the enduring appeal of over-the-top heroics and explosive entertainment.From the opening sequence, ""Con Air"" wastes no time in establishing its tone, plunging viewers into a violent prison riot that sets the stage for the mayhem to follow. The film's premise is deliciously outrageous: a group of the most dangerous criminals in the United States are being transported via a heavily fortified prison aircraft, aptly dubbed the ""Jailbird."" However, when a band of convicts led by the charismatic Cyrus ""The Virus"" Grissom (John Malkovich) orchestrates a daring hijacking, the once-routine transport turns into a high-stakes game of survival.At the center of this chaos is Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage), a former U. S. Ranger who has just been paroled after serving eight years for a crime of passion. Caught in the crossfire, Poe must draw upon his military training and unwavering determination to protect not only his fellow passengers but also a crucial key to thwarting the convicts' sinister plans.Cage delivers a pitch-perfect performance, effortlessly blending gritty intensity with a touch of sardonic humor. His portrayal of Poe as a reluctant hero is both compelling and relatable, making it easy for audiences to root for his character's survival and ultimate triumph.Supporting Cage is an ensemble cast that revels in the film's over-the-top nature. John Malkovich steals every scene as the deliciously unhinged Cyrus, while Steve Buscemi delivers a memorable turn as the eccentric serial killer Garland Greene. Other standouts include Ving Rhames as the intimidating Diamond Dog and Dave Chappelle in a scene-stealing cameo as Joe ""Pinball"" Parker.While the plot is undeniably far-fetched, ""Con Air"" embraces its absurdity with a wink and a nod, never taking itself too seriously. The action sequences are expertly choreographed and executed, delivering a steady stream of heart-pounding thrills and jaw-dropping stunts. From mid-air brawls to daring parachute jumps, the film never disappoints in its commitment to spectacle.Ultimately, ""Con Air"" succeeds as a cinematic guilty pleasure, a rollicking ride that unapologetically indulges in excess while delivering a healthy dose of popcorn entertainment. Its enduring popularity among action enthusiasts is a testament to its ability to captivate audiences with its over-the-top antics and larger-than-life characters. While not a masterpiece by any stretch, ""Con Air"" soars high as a prime example of a well-crafted, unabashedly fun action flick that knows exactly what it is and revels in it.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

And now the big but. BUT Con Air has a secret that isn't a secret: this cast, what a cast. This star power, this is where the strength lies, the entertainment. And this one task, depending on your point of view probably the most important one of a film, is more than fulfilled. So in a nutshell: a brutally bad film that is brutally good fun.

"So much speed, so much energy","The most awesome scene in this movie must be that fighting scene where somebody shoots our hero in the arm and he just keeps on walking. This thing has really slapped together a great cast for an action movie. John Malkovich! Ving Rhames! John Cusack! Steve Buscemi! The relevant Nicholas Cage! All in one movie, all in great straight-forward action scenes that remind me of John Woo. The writing is semi-mindless, with an appetite for destruction, but occasionally it shows more depth. Buscemi's conversation with the little girl is another highlight. The plot has been done millions of times, but never really this well. The developments are great, they keep everything dynamic, where most action flicks fade out and tend to drag near the ending. From that angle the screenplay is actually pretty creative. It's a movie that's probably at best in a wide-screen, surround sound, cinema experience, but you could watch it on a cell phone and it would still be cool. In conclusion, ""Con Air"" just plain rocks.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

The Cage Unleashed,"Con Air is a nostalgia bomb that I watched more times as a kid than I'd care to admit. It was one of those beloved childhood favorites that has now graduated to the guilty pleasure category. But who can resist the allure of Nicolas Cage in his most majestic form?This film unleashes Cage as Cameron Poe, a guy with a luxurious mane of hair. He finds himself aboard a prisoner transfer plane, surrounded by some of the most dangerous criminals you've ever seen - until the Suicide Squad. But he's the only one who's actually served his time, and all he wants is to get home for his daughter's birthday when all hell breaks loose on the plane. He even has a stuffed bunny for her that becomes the centerpiece of the most intense unboxing video - since Se7en.Alongside Cage, you've got John Malkovich playing the mastermind villain, and he's as sinister as they come. John Cusack brings his signature charm as the lawman trying to make sense of the chaos. And the supporting roster is a who's who of '90s tough guys - Ving Rhames, Danny Trejo, Steve Buscemi, and Dave Chappelle, adding layers of absurdity to this already over-the-top movie. The action sequences are unbelievably chaotic with all the thrills, spills, and cheesy one-liners you could ask for. There are explosions and fistfights; a crash into the Las Vegas Strip and a ridiculous high-octane chase involving a firetruck; Con Air delivers adrenaline-pumping moments one after another.This is not a movie you watch for its intricate plot or nuanced character development. No, this is the kind of film you put on when you're in the mood for a delightful time capsule of '90s action cinema, a big bowl of popcorn, and a sense of nostalgia. It's a high-flying, explosive thrill ride that defies logic and gravity while delivering maximum entertainment. Buckle up, because this is one ride you won't soon forget.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

You could tell that he was having a blast with the role and Malkovich himself is usually never disappointing whenever he gets an opportunity to have time on screen in any movie he's in.As for the plot, you don't really rely much on the plot in these sort of movies due to the action scenes that are provided in the film, although I do think that the movie handled itself well and had some pretty good emotional scenes, as well as some great action scenes as well.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A good cast can't save an awful script,"Were Con Air a parody, it would have been one of the best action flicks of the '90s.  Unfortunately, they played this truly awful script straight, and the result is one of the worst action flicks I've ever seen.  It's like watching a 90 minute trainwreck in slow motion.  I'd rather watch Pamela Anderson in Barb Wire again - at least that film was good for a few laughs, and had some imagination (lamebrained though it was).  Con Air is about as original as asphalt on a highway.The only surprising thing about this film is the sheer number of good, or at least competent actors stuck in it, including Malkovich, Buscemi, Colm Meaney and John Cusack.  I'm assuming they were all offered a fortune, and probably figured this stinker of a script would either get cleaned up while in production, or that their combined talents would allow them to rise above it.  It wasn't, and they can't.  As writer Mike Judge once had his characters Beavis and Butthead observe on their old television program, you can't polish a turd.Oh, and Nicolas Cage has become - without question - the most overrated actor in Hollywood.  I loved this guy in flicks like Raising Arizona, but he has almost systematically turned himself into cinema's premier soulless action film ""hero"".  His performance in this flick is tee vee movie of the week atrocious, and he sports what has to be the worst southern accent since Streisand's ludicrous attempt at one in Hello Dolly a generation ago.  If it weren't for his inexplicable ""status"" as an A-List star, giving him first pass on fantastic scripts like Adaptation, this guy would be waiting tables in his uncle's restaurant.  Here's some free advice, Nicky boy  having your character march around like he's in desperate need of a thousand pounds of Metamucil *isn't* acting.

Cringe at Nick Cage's accent (& hair) but watch for John Cusack,"Con Air is basically your standard popcorn flick - lots of explosions, bad-guys with really silly names (Cyrus the Virus, Billy Bedlam, Diamond Dog etc...) and just enough plot to get you to the next special effect.What makes this film better than average is the quality of its cast. Accent aside, Cage is fine as paroled con, Cameron Poe (who, of course, had a perfectly good excuse for killing someone and isn't a bad guy at all), but he is overshadowed by John's Cusack & Malkovich.Malkovich seems to relish playing Cyrus Grissom - the criminally insane sociopath who masterminds the capture of the plane - with an over-the-top flair that is both comic & chilling by turns while Cusack steals the show as U.S. Marshall Vince Larkin, who is on the ground struggling to contain the situation and keep his superiors from blowing the plane to bits (the exchanges between him and DEA agent Duncan Malloy (Colm Meaney) are particularly note-worthy).The finale is as over-the-top as you would expect from a Jerry Bruckhemimer production, cramming the maximum possible mayhem into the smallest possible time as the plane crash-lands on the Las Vegas strip, followed by a high speed chase through the city.Con Air doesn't pretend to be anything other than another fairly mindless action film and, if you watch it with that in mind, you won't be disappointed as (after a slightly slow start which sets up the reason for Cage being in prison) the action doesn't stop and the humour is better than average.My advice is watch this with friends & a plentiful supply of alcohol for an enjoyably pointless evening in.Rating: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

This and 'The Rock' – hell yeah!,"There are great films that will stand the test of time and then there are great – FUN – films. 'Con Air' is the latter. It may never be committed to the world's film archive as an example of classic Hollywood storytelling, but it deserves its place the annals of nineties action movies. For, if you're looking for one great action film that summed up the decade, then it's 'The Rock' (or possibly 'Speed'). But if you're looking for two or three, then Con Air should definitely be in there.Where do I start? Oh, yes, the star of the show. And, when I say 'star' I don't mean Nicholas Cage, but the explosions! Everything (and very nearly everyone!) explodes around here. Years before Michael Bay bored us to death with those pretty explosions Con Air did it first (and better!). However, apart from the fireworks, it does boast a really impressive cast to blow things up. Yes, Nick Cage is at the forefront of the carnage and he plays what is actually a bit of a tongue in cheek role straight as they come. He's ably assisted by John Cusack and – perhaps more importantly – John Malkovich, as he's almost as important as the explosions. The fact is, he's possibly one of the greatest (and possibly under-rated) villains ever to grace the silver screen. He's absolutely fantastically bad, only slightly over the top, but never playing it so much that he becomes unbelievable or a cartoon of himself. Now, it's easy to give all the acting credit to Malkovich, but this 'rogues gallery' of an aeroplane is also packed full of colourful (and completely evil) other prisoners and a special mention to Steve Buscemi who isn't in it for as long as some might wish, but is also fun to watch as a – not particularly subtle – Hannibal Lecter clone.Anyway, the plot our Nicholas Cage plays a U.S. ranger who returns from active duty to his pregnant wife, only to immediately he embroiled in a bar fight where he ends up killing his assailant. Now mercy is spared here and he ends up being sent to prison for years. Then, and all this is hardly a spoiler as it all happens in practically the first five minutes, when he does get released he only ends up on a prison plane flying across America that gets hijacked by the convicts. Some guys just don't get a break.I think the reason I find Con Air so watchable is because it's serious, but not dark – if that makes sense. It kind of knows that it's being a bit overblown and has some nice moments of humour thrown in there, but it's part of that generation of action film that came because 'uber-serious' action films were forced upon us ('Bourne' franchise and Daniel Craig's Bond – I'm looking at you).I find it hard to believe that there are people out there who won't find some enjoyment from this film. Even if you're not a massive fan of any of the stars or action movies in general, this is just such a daft, silly ride then surely you can't help yourself from climbing aboard the plane and going along for a – very explosive – ride.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Obviously from time to time the searches and the aspirations to get to this perfection can lead to a disaster so ""perfect"", that in it you cannot find anything... GOOD, actually - even if you search with subatomic microscope. ""Con Air"" has achieved this ""perfection"" to the full, but multiplied by minus one.And yet, you cannot create a nice and decent film only by doing the opposite to what the script-writers, the director, the actors and the producers of ""Con Air"" did. You cannot do it simply by multiplying with (-1). Cause there is one thing in ""Con Air"", which equals zero: and it is the plot - the vision, the ideas, the messages, which every movie has to have. And as it has no plot and no reasoning, apart from the wish of the its makers to show us unimaginably ridiculous pile of crap that they intended to label ""an action movie for fun"", you see the point: when you multiply anything by zero, you will get zero again.The conclusion is clear: you cannot make a film without a core, and the core of every film is some kind of an noticeable idea. Only the comedies (and not all of them) are excused of that need, but then it has to be replaced by a continuous number of really good jokes, tricks and comic situations. Take ""Blue streak"" as an example: what it would be without the lost diamond, or without the main character being black? Only some stupid chases and shootings will remain. But how he tried to retrieve the diamond, and the comic situations that came from it - this is enough to create a good, fun action movie. Just don't take it seriously, when you lack the big idea to tell!The idea is indispensable for a serious movie - so if you don't have what to say to the world, you will never make even the slightest kind of a good non-comedy movie - even with a billion dollar budget at your disposal. In this case - depending on what your social status is - better go wash dishes, or continue to drive your daddy's $200,000 jeep, that he gave you for your birthday. While if you have a good idea and you don't want to spoil it tragically, watch ""Con Air"", and watch it at least 20 times, and oblige everybody from your future film-making team to watch it, cause there - in the most vivid, noticeable and ""classic"" way - it is shown HOW NOT TO MAKE A MOVIE. It can also be used as a certain kind of ""barometer"": whoever has actually liked it and didn't find how shallow and silly it is, is himself exceptionally stupid. To be more specific, he is more stupid than one hundred thousand sitting ducks, staring at a ticking bomb right in front of them.This film has in it - in compacted and very accessible form - EVERY SINGLE THING THAT YOU HAVE TO AVOID, when you make a movie. The idiotic dialogues; the terribly overexposed, mostly misplaced and pointless effects; the obvious physical impossibility of so many scenes that were supposed to be ""for real""; the irritating, horrible acting of so many of the cast - who probably were contesting for the ""Triple worst actor"" Golden Raspberry awards; the infinite clichés - especially this about the innocent convict, who not only has to beat the bad guys, but also the police, the government and the military, which, of course, are not aware of the situation, so unwillingly help the bad ones and handicap the hero - yet he will overcome the difficulties (or rather - the impossibilities) and prevail in the end - and they will arrive only to witness the spoils of his smashing victory, to shake his hand and to apologize that they almost killed him (I'm not sure if ""the-authority-shakes-hands-and-thanks-the-hero-for-the-good-job"" scene was in the film, but in the last minutes it had turned into such an omnipotent mess, that my head turned into a pumpkin); and on top of it - the serial child killer, who happened to be so nice person: this almost brought me to tears; and so many more - from beginning to end, embroidered in every second of this movie disaster... I actually can't count them all, without breaching the 1000 words limit.Despite all said above, from an ironical point of view ""Con Air"" has a value. I gave it the lowest possible rating, because it was the worst movie ever created, but I also have written this comment about it. There are worse films than ""Con Air"", but they are so unnoticeable, they cannot earn even that ""label"" - ""THE WORST MOVIE"" - as not only me, but nobody would ever watch them. While this one had a relatively prominent cast, Nicolas Cage in first place, and I kept watching it to find how bad it will go, and to see the disaster from the whole perspective. It caught my attention with its HORRIBLE, YET CLASSICAL WEAKNESSES. And what about the actors? What they played is always played by total ""beginners"", not by career actors, and as they are totally unknown, nobody notices the movie also. Yet these ones were moderately well-known in Hollywood, I think. We have to pay them a tribute: they destroyed - if not their careers - at least their reputation, in order to give us this classic anti-example of a movie.It is the most vivid, conspicuous film that you have to watch in order to find what kind of films you must never watch.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Totally stupid and over-the-top, but so unbelievably AWESOME that nobody should care","The attempts at drama and characterization in ""Con Air"" are exceptionally hollow and simplistic. There is not a hint of logic through the entire screenplay. The cast is made up of big names who barely bother with the acting side of things at all, and Nick Cage's southern drawl and put-on everyman badassery doesn't exactly qualify as a good performance. There are also several shots which are downright bad, scenes just run into each other with no fluidity (even the score changes from sugary sweet sentimentality to menacing hard rock far too abruptly), and the movie just generally has the intelligence of a peanut.But of course as you've probably guessed by now I F-CKING LOVED ""Con Air"" simply because it is F-CKING AWESOME. Sh-t gets BLOWED UP REAL GOOD. Nick Cage says stuff like ""What do you think I'm gonna do? I'm gonna save the *beep* day!"", which is just REALLY F-CKING AWESOME. John Malkovich chews scenery like the best damned steak he's ever had in his life, and says sh-t like ""onara!"" after a guy started saying his name, begging him not to burn him alive. The guy says ""Cy..."" and Malkovich says ""onara!"" GET IT?! He even says this to a rapist: ""You keep that in mind when you look at her. Because if your dick jumps out of your pants, you jump off this plane."" HOW F-CKING AWESOME IS THAT? COULD THIS *beep* GET ANY BETTER? Believe it or not, the sh-t does in fact get even better.How does it manage to get better? THEY F-CKING CRASH-LAND IN F-CKING VEGAS, MAN! Sh-t gets BLOWED UP REAL F-CKING GOOD, and stuff is destroyed and oh man they even tack on a totally extraneous action scene near the end! You get a shot of John Cusack and Nick Cage getting on two motorcycles and looking deliberately badass! HOW F-CKING AWESOME IS THAT?If you don't cry tears of joy during the insanely protracted and eye-roll-worthy finale with Nick Cage reuniting finally with his daughter, you have no appreciation for AWESOMENESS. Because while ""Con Air"" is exceptionally dumb and lacking in logic, it also has an extremely high amount of AWESOME. I know for sure now that AWESOME is an ingredient which can cancel out every single bit of intelligence in my brain and turn me into a caveman just like Nick Cage in this movie. The movie has the line: ""This is a situation that needs to get unf-cked, right now!"" for Christ's sake! THAT TRANSCENDS ANY AWESOMENESS EVER PREVIOUSLY KNOWN TO MAN.TOTALLY. F-CKING. AWESOME.BEST.

All aboard!!,"Con Air stars Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, John Malkovich, and is what I like to call the second film in the Nick Cage summer trilogy. The film revolves around a former U.S. Ranger who has been released for serving a ten-year sentence for manslaughter. He's about to fly home to see his wife and daughter, but things take a turn for the worst when the passengers take control of the plane. I'll talk go into more detail about it in the first one, but the rundown is is that Nicolas Cage has starred in the Rock, Con Air, and three weeks after this movie he would later star in Face Off. And what's more ironic is that The Rock and Con Air are both produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. Now that I have gotten that out of the way lets talk about this movie as a whole. While I enjoyed the concept of the film and how the film didn't take itself seriously it feels like this was split into two groups when it came to the script. Group A was responsible for creating a script that wasn't to be taken seriously, but stilled be enjoyed at the same time and Group B's responsibility was to provide us with some action. And while Group A succeeded in the first half Group B got drunk on testosterone and gave us out of control action that the entire time felt like a competition to see who was tough. And that's where I think the problem lies. Groups A and B couldn't settle on an agreement so they turned this film into a macho ego competition. The only thing that kept it from falling apart was the cast as they try their best to keep this movie on autopilot instead of letting it crash and burn. But the one person that soars above all is Cyrus the Virus played by John Malkovich. He's sadistic, funny, and terrifying all in one that in some strange way I found myself actually liking and cheering him at the same time. I liked John Malkovich in this movie so much that even if the movie did crash and burn I wouldn't stop watching because his performance is terrifyingly fantastic and nobody in the making of Con Air would question him. But the movie isn't that bad as Group A and B finally come together and bring this movie in for a sweet landing. So in the end, while this film may provide some turbulence, it's still a sweet ride to board.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
An exercise in sheer 90s excess that's as ridiculous as it is fun.,"After serving 7 years for accidentally killing a drunk man who tried to assault his wife, Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) is paroled and is put on a prisoner transport plane for his processing destination which also contains several violent criminals who are being transferred to a new supermax. A takeover of the plane is coordinated by Cyrus ""the Virus"" Grissom (John Malkovich) who through the help of several other prisoners manages to incapacitate the guards and seize control. While Poe has an opportunity to leave, his friend O'Dell (Mykelti Williamson) and several guards at the mercy will be trapped and decides to stay hoping to stop them. On the ground, U. S. Marshal, Vince Larkin (John Cusack), tries to bring the plane back under control on his end as Poe tries to coordinate through makeshift messaging routes, as Poe fights suspicions of the rogue inmates and Larkin fights bureaucracy and interagency squabbling.Released in 1997, Con Air marked the first film from Jerry Bruckheimer following the death of longtime producing partner, Don Simpson. Having seen major success with last years The Rock it makes sense that Bruckheimer would want to recapture some of the success in a similar high concept action thriller featuring Nicolas Cage. The movie features the directorial debut of music video/commercial director Simon West, and West gives us one of the most excessive, non-sensical, and insane action movies from a decade defined by excess, and I mean that in the most complimentary way possible.Con Air boasts a fantastic cast with Cage's quirky acting style and laid back charisma well suited for the leading role of Cameron Poe, and makes for a commanding but likable protagonist you can't help but root for. John Cusack is also quite good as Poe's U. S. Marshal ally Vince Larkin, the level headed investigator who's Poe's best chance of taking down the plane and freeing the hostages while his colleagues just want to shoot it down and let God sort it out. Last, but certainly not least is John Malkovich as Cryus ""the Virus"" Grissom who's well suited to playing a diabolical mastermind who kills without remorse or hesitation and plans everything to the smallest detail, it's a really good villain performance that definitely ranks with the benchmarks of Dennis Hopper in Speed, Patrick Swayze in Point Break, or Gary Oldman in The Professional.The action in the movie is per the standard for a Bruckheimer production loud, excessive, and chaotic, but unlike Bruckheimer's other Commercial turned film director, Michael Bay, Simon West has enough restraint to cut where he needs to and put in breaks and pauses between the action beats so we can appreciate them rather than be exhausted by them. At 108 minutes not including credits, the movie is the perfect length for its roller coaster plot never pausing too long to let the audience think and always keeping the audience engaged with strong expressive performances from the supporting cast, or Simon West's bizarre tangents such as a serial killer played by Steve Buscemi that is one of the most pointless and ancillary characters I've ever seen in a movie like this and yet there's a twisted sort of dark humor that comes from this character in just how detached he is from what's going on and despite him having little to do with the movie ""plot"" wise, I was always drawn to Buscemi whenever he was on camera and never cared he wasn't moving anything forward.Con Air is the pinnacle of 90s action junk food and but it does so with care and restraint. While Simon West is just as excessive as Michael Bay in his debut, West does so with craft and care and makes a movie that moves briskly and doesn't overstay its welcome. With strong performances, well staged action, and a quirky sense of dark humor, I found myself caught up in Con Air because of its sheer silliness and excess.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Another overblown Jerry Bruckheimer-produced action flick to rival ""The Rock""!","As an aircraft full of murderers, rapists and criminals pulls away into the air, a rope attached to the tail of the beast catches on a convertible's front bumper, pulling the car upwards where it flies into the air, and sways back and forth, as the plane picks up altitude. ""On any other day, that might look strange,"" Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) says as he stares out the back of the plane and watches with exasperation.Cameron is having a strange day, indeed. The film begins eight years prior to the present. Cameron returns home from the Military to his pregnant wife, who is being harassed by a band of drunken idiots where she works at the town bar. Shrugging them off, Cameron and his wife are both assaulted by the men when they make a dash for their car in the rainfall outside the place. Defending his wife, Cameron kills the men and is sentenced to 7 - 10 years in prison. Because he is a trained government weapon, his murder charges are a bit different than those of other criminals. Because he knows how to kill more than most people, he is given a longer sentence. If the point of this is to make the audience wonder why in the world the justice system works like this, it has achieved its goal.Flash forward eight years, and Cameron is finally getting parole. Hitching a ride back to his wife on a plane with a band of ruthless criminals, Cameron expects nothing less than a pleasant ride. But when ""Sirus the Virus"" (John Malkovich) takes over the plane with his buddy (Ving Rhames), everything goes wrong.Cameron is suddenly an undercover hero. Back on land, a U.S. Marshal played by John Cusack thinks something is wrong. When he finds aircraft blueprints lodged in Sirus' old prison cell, he realizes that the plane could be in trouble. Cameron solidifies the marshal's suspicions when he alerts everyone on ground (in secret) that the plane has been taken over. He also tells them where it's going to be landing.The movie's grand finale--in which the plane lands on a Las Vegas strip--is silly but fun. The film is a Jerry Bruckheimer production that rivals ""The Rock."" Very similar, it's an over-the-top action extravaganza with big explosions, a ""Die Hard""-esque plot, and a surprisingly large human quotient in the mix. It's one of the best action films of the past decade; the type of film all the pale imitators always try to be, and few ever come so close to actually being.Nicolas Cage, who in fact starred in ""The Rock,"" is often picked on for bad acting. I like him. Here he provides a sort of gentle hero to the film, more realistic than Stallone would be, not quite as funny as Arnie, but somewhere in between both of them. He was absolutely fabulous in ""Adaptation"" (2002), and also in ""Leaving Las Vegas,"" for which he won an Oscar. I'm one of his bigger fans. He doesn't disappoint here.John Malkovich is great as the villain. Something about the man has always seemed strange, and he's good at playing oddball serial killers and baddies. Malkovich was creepy and effective in Clint Eastwood's thriller ""In the Line of Fire,"" downright silly in ""Johnny English,"" lovable in ""Of Mice and Men,"" and here he's creepy again.My favorite character in the film has to be that played by Steve Buscemi, though. ""He makes the Manson family look like the Partridge family,"" someone tells Cameron. He went on a killing spree and murdered thirty people. He tells Cameron that one time he drove for three hours wearing a little girl's head as a hat. ""Feel free not to share with me,"" Cameron tells him.In other cases, Buscemi's character might seem totally evil. Here he's funny, though, because the film makes us think he's murdered again after the plane lands to re-fuel, and then we find out he hasn't when we see his potential victim waving at the plane as it takes off again. That makes him a ""good guy."" It's all contrivances in the script, but it works. Just like the film.4.5/5 stars.John Ulmer",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Sometimes an action movie is what you need,"I've seen this movie, several times, ages ago and just wanted to watch some Nicolas Cage again. Just in time for his latest movie, which looks much better than what he's been in, in the last decade or so.The actors in Con Air are well-known - almost all of them are faces I've seen before.It's an easy plot, but with fairly diverse characters. Most are in the template category, as in, you know their modus operandi for the whole movie almost before it has even started.It's an action movie from the 90s, you know what you get, and love it.

Predictably stupid,"Oh my word, is Nick Cage channeling Segal or some other action-movie retard?I can't believe that John Cusak is in this. Money must have been tight at his house.

"Shooting, explosions, one-liners, what more do you want?","This is a dumb movie but a very entertaining one. I was thinking it's like the quintessential Michael Bay movie but I guess it's actually a Jerry Bruckheimer movie which isn't that much different.It kicks ass and that's all it does. People walk away from explosions in slow motion, everyone talks in one liners, it's full of pop culture references, the plot is very over-the-top, as are many of the performances, lots of stuff blows up, etc.This brought back some nice memories. I must have watched Con Air a lot as a teenager because I remembered it really well. It's funny how some things just sit somewhere in the back of your mind for years, gathering dust, but pick them up, blow the dust off and they're ready to go. I knew this movie way better than I thought I did.When a movie has a main draw - action in this case - and it works, nothing else matters that much. This is a high energy, adventurous, big and stupid movie which works quite well. About as good as movies like this can be. Up there with Independence Day.It was funny to see Dave Chappelle basically playing himself - I had no idea who he was all those years ago. In general the cast is quite good - John Cusack is likeable and funny, the same with John Malkovich as the villain, Ving Rhames, Steve Buscemi, Monica Potter, etc. They're all good. Nic Cage is Nice Cage. He has long hair and keeps saying ""Hummingbird"". And his physique seems pretty good. The classic ""good guy caught in the wrong place at the wrong time"".The action is put together quite well. It's big and entertaining. There are some cool stunts and the effects work pretty well - nothing stands out as bad CGI or anything. And the plot moves pretty fast.The music is quite effective as well. Nothing brilliant but some nice and memorable themes for the goodies and baddies. Plenty of electric guitar and a kind of heavy rock feel.Movies like this are entertaining enough to make you forget or not care how stupid they are. That does take skill. Con Air is well crafted enough to keep you engaged for the whole runtime and maybe to even revisit it again later.

Perfect if it wasn't for Cage,"My TV guide insists on granting ""Con Air"" a single star, whereas ""The Rock"" usually receives three. While the two of them have a lot in common. They use the same combination of Nicolas Cage teamed up with another major name and state-of-the-art action sequences in order to deliver a roller-coaster action thriller against an original background.But i'm here to discuss ""Con Air"" in its own integrity. During several screenings i started to make an explicit distinction between the elements that work and the aspects which probably upset the critic community.The principal cast mostly gives away a good performance : John Malkovich is due to his voice & eyes the perfect choice to bring Cyrys Grissom to live. It was one of the few times i would nominate an actor as the new Anthony 'Zorba' Quinn. Next, Ving Rhames' portrayal of a black militant seems more convincing than the decent, but rather soulless roles of Nick Chinlund Danny Trejo - whose characters get a little more attention than most of the convicts. On the other side of the law, John Cusack found himself an appealing equilibrium between the rookie and the sidekick approach. Steve Buscemi is a man apart. Although basically he has little more to do that put his teeth and tiny humid eyes to work to play the greatest psycho of them all, Garland Greene wouldn't have been the same without Buscemi's dry sense of humour. He is a relief - well, measured by the standards of action movie humour. For example, his comments on insanity & idiocy have the class of a Trainspotting voice-over.As for the action, there are some memorable moments : the breakout, the trap at the deserted airfield and the firetruck chase in Vegas really brought out the merciless insanity connected to the convicts on the Jailbird. The other sequences may not be as good, but keep up a rapid, steady pace. So far, we have a more than average action flick which is enriched by its cast. Then where lie weak points ?Number On : Nicolas Cage !! It is a complicated matter which is best explained through another comparison with the Rock : both times he played a sensitive hero, making good use of his personal charisma, but the emotional background Scott Rosenberg came up with for Con Air feel like a lame excuse to put a likable one-man army on screen. Apart from that, his haircut and smoky BBC accent annoyed me immensely. Number two : that stupid diabetic sidekick of his was merely another twist of the script to make us connect with Cameron Poe. I did not give a damn whether he'd succumb to an insulin shortage or take one between the eyes like the three stooges aka Carl, Bensen & Popovich.Number three ... you've got to have some Elvis Presley or Tom Jones on the soundtrack when you take a trip to Vegas, though Buscemi's attachment to Sweet Home Alabama largely make up for it :-)",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Loud , brash , over the top action movie extravagance","""Con air"" defines the term ""popcorn movie"". It's an action film designed strictly to entertain. The film is over-the-top with over-the-top characters, dialogue and situations that are just too unbelievable to happen in real life. It's done DELIBERATELY . ""Con Air"" is pure cartoonish excess from start to finish . A genuine escapism. At no point does this film ever take itself seriously. I cant help but feel that people who didn't liked this movie haven't realized the joke.The movie was inspired by a newspaper article about a plane that transports convicts. The story does have resemblance to ""Die hard"". Anyway , the story is rather thin , full of holes and the characters are one dimensional The screenplay however deserves praise for the dialogues and colorful characters.Direction by Simon West is great. He has a quick-cut, music-video sensibility . The film moves along at a brisk pace, cheerfully glossing over its own improbabilities, you might even not notice the plot holes because things are happening so quick. West manages to cut from one story arc to another with a certain amount of skill, keeping each arc from completely snowballing into something unmanageable. West keeps you on the edge of your seat with the non stop action. There are multiple destructions of all kinds throughout the film and countless explosions. From one devastating climax to another devastating climax. At the end you'll be left breathless and your senses stinging with over-stimulation. The corny emotional sequences, however, ring completely hollow.There is a hell of impressing cast here : John Malkovich ( superb as crazy bad motherf***** Cyrus The Virus) , Steve Buscemi ( a brilliant pastiche of Hannibal Lecter with his Garland Greene) , John Cusack ( nice good guy) , Ving Rhames ( great as intellectual black racist) , Danny Trejo ( good as sadistic rapist Johnny 23) , Dave Chappelle (the first and only time he was funny – as Pinball) and finally Nicolas Cage ( a weird mix of Jesus and Rambo , but it works).Also the lesser known actors deserve applause : Renoly (as the gay prisoner Sally Can't Dance) , Colm Meaney (as the asshole cop) , Mykelti Williamson ( as the always suffering Baby O) , Rachel Ticotin ( as tough guard Sally Bishop) and Monica Potter (as the loving wife Tricia Poe).The movie is full of great dialogues and one liners . Here are some of my favourite quotes : ""Define irony: a bunch of idiots dancing around on a plane to a song made famous by a band that died in a plane crash."" And ""Insanity, I'll tell you what insanity is: spending sixty years working in an office only to end up in an old folks home to die an undignified death while trying to get to the toilet – that is insanity"" . Who could forget ""Put the bunny down"" or ""He's got the whole world in his hands"".Non stop action and hundreds of classic one-liners, what's here not to love ? ""Con air"" it's an endlessly re-watchable genuine action movie escapism. Lynrynd Skynryd "" Sweet home Alabama"" is a song that reminds me of this movie . Simple , unambitious , fun and charming . Just like ""Con air"" . I give it 7/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Still Nic Cage's best work yet,Would be much better if it didn't have Nic Cage in it. His accent in the whole film is cringe worthy at best and down right shameful for the majority of the movie. The fact that he looks like a bald eagle that got turned into a human by a vengeful witch is amplified by the gollum like strands of hair that look consistently damp throughout the film. How he landed the roll baffles me and makes me wonder what kind of blackmail he had on the director.Steve Buscemi's performance is breif but he steals the whole film with a single scene that had my stomach twisting in knots.If you're a fan of John Cusack then I couldn't recommend it more.

Story-content wise it's a bit of a let down.This film can be recommended to those who love a good dose of action. If you're looking for something deep, look somewhere else.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Fantastic last half,"My Age: 13Cameron Poe, played by Nicolas Cage, a former US ranger, is being released from jail.  He went there for murdering a man while defending his wife. The fastest way to get home to his wife and child is if he takes a plane filled with some of the worst criminals which ever lived.  The worst of the worst, Cyrus the Virus, played by John Malkovich, leads the criminals in taking control of the plane, so that they can live the rest of their lives in freedom.  Cameron must stop them.  Helping on the ground is US Marshal Vince Larkin, played by John Cusack.The first half of this film is fairly good, but after the plane lands at Lerner airfield, this movie really kicks into full swing.  The criminals are very well thought out, as are the rest of the characters.  Acting from the 3 main leads is very good, but some of the others are fairly ordinary. Action is dynamic and fantastic in the last half, though in the first half it seems too rushed.  With an incredible ending climax, Con Air will definitely please action fans.Australian Classification: MA 15+: Medium Level ViolenceRating: 88 out of 100",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Free Bird,"It's been years since I've watched ""Con Air"", but as it was covered by the ""How Did This Get Made"" podcast that was the inspiration I needed to fire it up again. Though it's still a reasonably entertaining time, and with some stellar performances, there are some sections that haven't aged particularly well.Cameron Poe (Nicholas Cage) is a parolee hitching a ride on a cross county flight taking some of the worst criminals in US History to a new supermax prison. When the prisoners, led by Cyrus Grissom (John Malkovich) take control of the plane, Poe is forced to remain on board and attempt to thwart the escape, to save the live of his friend O'Dell (Lykelti Williamson) who is going into a diabetic coma. Vince Larkin (John Cusack) tries to convince the authorities not to shoot down his plane, but everyone has underestimated the scale of Grissom's plan.I can't say that ""Con Air"" doesn't still have the power to entertaining. The high concept action films of the 90's were very popular at the time and Nicholas Cage was one of the kings of them. It's difficult now to think back to just how big a star he was, with this and ""Face/Off"" coming out at around the same time. You could also wrangle a proper actor into your movie at this point, without having to through the Marvel bucks at them. With Grissom and Cusack both taking roles for money to help work on passion projects. You can also chuck in four iconic character actors, with Ving Rhames, Danny Trejo, MC Gainey and Steve Buscemi taking roles as convicts on the plane.Time hasn't been particularly kind to some aspects of the film though, the visual effects are starting to show their age a bit and there's a casuality to the death and the racist language that a film this flippant wouldn't go for now. The odd plot element doesn't really make sense. Why exactly does Larkin not want them to shoot the plane down? I know eventually he bonds with Poe but still, it's the least risky, least expensive option - particularly given the carnage of what does happen to the plane.It's certainly cheesy, and of it's time, but I can't say I wasn't still entertained by ""Con Air"".",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"An Excellent,Action-Packed And Explosive Action-Thriller. Nicolas Cage And Jerry Bruckheimer At Their Best.","Con Air is an excellent,Action-packed and explosive Action-Thriller that combines terrific direction,a wonderful all-star cast,outstanding Action and a memorable score. All of those elements make Con Air not only one of my favorite Action Films but also of the best Action movies of the 1990s that is Nicolas Cage and Jerry Bruckheimer at their best.Con Air tells the story of United States Army Ranger Cameron Poe(Nicolas Cage)who after serving 8 years in prison for manslaughter is getting out on parole and going home to his wife and daughter and to get home he has to board a plane that transfers prisoners. Unfortunately for Cameron the plane is taken over by convict Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom(John Malkovich)and other prisoners. Now,Cameron with the help of U.S Marshall Vince Larkin(John Cusack) has to stop Cyrus save the say and get home to see his family.Con Air is a brilliant and exciting Action movie that was a Box Office hit in 1997 and is a film that I have loved ever since I saw it on Home Video during the late 1990s and in my opinion is not only one of the most enjoyable,watchable and defining Action movies of the 1990s but also one of the Nicolas Cage's and Jerry Bruckheimer's finest hours on the silver screen and is a big budget spectacle that is explosive as it is thrilling and is the true definition of a roller coaster ride that you just never want to end. Ranking alongside with The Rock(1996),Bad Boys(1995),Crimson Tide(1995),Enemy Of The State(1998),Black Hawk Down(2001),Top Gun(1986),Beverly Hills Cop I(1984 and II(1987)and Flashdance(1983)Con Air is one of the best productions from Jerry Bruckheimer. Con Air is one of those movies that whenever it's on television you just never turn it off and just gives viewers non-stop thrills and entertainment from start to finish and is the kind of movie you watch with a drink and popcorn. Con Air is a movie that is just re-watchable no matter how many times you watch it. This is a movie that has everything I love about Action films:great Action,memorable characters and great lines that are catchy all within a Die Hard type storyline with a very good twist,instead of terrorists taking over building it's prisoners taking over a plane. Another thing I also love about Con Air is that the movie never takes itself too seriously because it's a movie that is big,loud and over the top meaning that the film isn't going to win any Oscars,get tons of acclaim from major film critics or give viewers thought provoking story that is important,it's an Action movie for Action lovers. The movie also doesn't take itself too seriously because of the Humor thanks to the main and supporting characters(some who are straight forward and others who are weird and nutty)and with moments and scenes of wildness and fun. The Action scenes in Con Air are amazing,fast and intense and when you see the Action you don't want it to stop. There is tons of Action and more with gunfights,fist fights,explosions and heck there's even a car chase sequence and each of the Action scenes are big,in your face and done in Jerry Bruckheimer's style of quick and slow motion because like in any Jerry Bruckheimer production everything is far and beyond it's limits and the pace goes from 5 to 100 in seconds. The Action scenes will have Action fans glued to the screen and craving for more. The main character Cameron Poe is the tradition Action hero he's a one-man Army who is strong willed using his fists as well as his brains and can kick anyone's butt in the entire film but he's does it for a reason and that is to get home and see his wife and daughter. You also like Cameron because of his honor and loyalty to not only people but to certain principles and ideals that is true to his nature. You will root for Cameron Poe to survive and beat the bad guys. The ending of Con Air is outstanding and is filled with terrific Action and thrills that will have you cheering at the screen. A wonderful conclusion.The cast is wonderful. Nicolas Cage is excellent and at his best as Cameron Poe,with Cage kicking butt with a Southern accent and mullet. John Cusack is terrific as Vince Larkin,a U.S Marshall. John Malkovich is brilliant and at his best as Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom,one of my favorite Action movie villains with Malkovich being charismatic and evil. Steve Buscemi is delightful as Garland 'The Marietta Mangler' Greene,a serial killer. Ving Rhames is great as Nathan 'Diamond Dog',Cyrus' partner in crime. Colm Meaney is wonderful as Duncan Malloy,a DEA Agent. Rachel Ticotin(Guard Sally Bishop),Mykelti Williamson(Mike 'Baby-O' O'Dell),Danny Trejo(Johnny-23),Nick Chinlund(William Billy Bedlam Bedford),M.C Gainey(Swamp Thing),Dave Chapelle(Joe Pinball Parker),Monica Potter(Tricia Poe),Renoly(Sally Can't Dance),Jesse Borrergo(Francisco Cindino),Steve Easton(Guard Falzon),Jose Zuniga(DEA Agent Willie Sims)John Roelius(Skip),Angela Featherstone(Ginny),Landry Albright(Casey Poe)and more give good performances as well.The direction by Simon West is fantastic,with West bringing an energetic style and pace to the film while doing an incredible job with the Action scenes. Fine direction,West. There is also songs by Tricia Yearwood(How Do I Live)and the classic song by Lynyrd Skynyrd(Sweet Home Alabama).The score by Mark Mancina and Trevor Rabin is great,big and matches the tone of the movie perfectly. Nice score,Mancina and Rabin.In final word,if you love Action Films,Nicolas Cage or Jerry Bruckheimer,I highly suggest you see Con Air,an excellent,Action-packed and explosive Action-Thriller that you will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"pulling a ""con"" of sorts","Mostly, ""Con Air"" is your typical action flick: a good guy gets put with a bevy of bad guys, and when the latter take over, it's up to the good guy to save the day. I figure that overall, the concept is actually pretty stupid. Still, Nicolas Cage manages to do some neat things with his role. I think that my favorite part was actually the car's license plate (I wonder whether you can actually get that written on a license plate).Maybe this movie is nothing special. It's a good, fun way to kill time, even if it seems quite improbable.

An awesome and exhilarating thrill ride everyone should take,"Strap yourselves in, fasten your seatbelts and prepare for one of the most exhilarating thrill rides of your life as ""Con Air"" takes you on a two-hour adventure that includes an all-star cast, powerful action sequences and great direction.""Con Air"" revolves around a plane carrying high-risk prisoners being transported to a maximum-security prison. However, the prisoners have other ideas.The ""Con Air"" director chose five immensely and incredibly talented actors who fit this formula. Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, John Malkovich, Ving Rhames lead an all-star, stellar cast in ""Con Air."" It didn't take long to realize these five actors contained a massive amount of chemistry.Cage stars as Cameron Poe, a parolee on his way home to his wife and daughter until he runs into a problem and save the day. Cage is one of the most versatile actors I have come across. Playing everything from a romantic lead in ""It Could Happen To You"" and Moonstruck"" to dramatic roles in ""Leaving Las Vegas"" and ""Bringing Out The Dead"" to comedic roles in ""Trapped In Paradise"" and ""Guarding Tess."" Cage is the ultimate action star combining all of these elements to bring home the role of Cameron Poe.Monica Potter and young Landry Albright star as Cameron's wife and daughter to whom he is flying home to after being paroled. Potter's beauty radiates off the screen with such heat and force I almost melt.She may not be a veteran at the time, but Potter's poise, beauty, talent and presence has proved that she could be mistaken for one. I relish every opportunity I had to watch her on screen because I knew what I was seeing was something special. Potter is on the rise with awards in her future and great films on the horizon.Albright's performance as Casey brought smiles to my face because she is one of the cutest and most talented newcomers to hit Hollywood in recent years. Albright may not have a lot of dialogue, but her presence on screen is a sight for sore eyes, her beauty is hypnotizing and her energy is electric.Albright will have a long, bright future in acting if she decides to pursue the profession because she has the special sparkle in her eye and aura surrounding her. I can't wait to see her next film.Malkovich is Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom, the ringleader of the hijacking. Malkovich's face oozes with villainous intent, which is one of the reasons he is so great at playing one. With his role in ""Con Air,"" he proves once again he is the best. Cyrus was calm, cool, and collected in the face of danger as he led his group of convicts. I have gained a new respect for Malkovich because I was able to see the true range and versatility he brought to the role.However, the best was yet to come as I learned that the supporting cast was a welcome surprise. For example, Rhames is Nathan 'Diamond Dog' Jones, Cyrus' right hand man. Mykelti Williamson stars as Baby-O O'Dell, Poe's only friend on board ""The Jailbird."" John Cusack is Vince Larkin, a federal agent, who from the ground is doing his best to bring down the plane full of convicts. At odds with Larkin is Duncan Malloy, played by Colm Meaney.Another aspect of ""Con Air"" I enjoyed was the writing because the film was able to tell a story with substance without letting the action take over. Creating great character development and story depth are just a few examples how the writers were able to win me over.The special effects in ""Con Air"" is great that it made me feel as if were part of that flight right along with the convicts. I commend director Simon West, and producer Jerry Bruckheimer on how well they put together the action sequences and bringing together the tremendous cast without any clash of egos.Finally, the one thing that signed, sealed, and delivered this movie was the signature song performed by Trisha Yearwood called ""How Do I Live."" It remains my favorite song even today, five years after ""Con Air"" was released.This is an action packed film from start to finish that has a believable plot; as well as comedic moments at times with great one-liners by various actors. I urge everyone to see ""Con Air"" for a great action film with substance.",,Anonymous,Crime

"Fasten Your Seatbelts: 'Con Air' Takes Off with Criminals, Chaos, and Cage!","""Con Air"" (1997) is an action-packed thrill ride that takes to the skies, boasting a star-studded cast, impressive stunts, and a healthy dose of 90s nostalgia. While it doesn't quite reach cruising altitude, this Nicolas Cage-led vehicle is an entertaining, if flawed, romp that's sure to satisfy fans of the genre.The film's strongest asset is its charismatic lead, Nicolas Cage, who brings his signature intensity and unpredictability to the role of Cameron Poe, a wrongly convicted prisoner on a mission to clear his name. Cage's presence elevates the entire production, making even the most implausible moments feel somewhat believable. His chemistry with co-star John Cusack, who plays U. S. Marshal Vince Larkin, adds a welcome layer of tension and humor to the proceedings.The supporting cast is equally impressive, featuring a who's who of 90s character actors, including John Malkovich, Steve Buscemi, and Ving Rhames. Each brings their own brand of eccentricity to their respective roles, making the film's eclectic ensemble a joy to watch.From a technical standpoint, ""Con Air"" is a marvel. The aerial stunts are breathtaking, with the film's climactic plane crash sequence remaining one of the most memorable set pieces of the decade. Simon West's direction is workmanlike, if unremarkable, but he handles the action with aplomb, keeping the pace brisk and the tension high.Where ""Con Air"" falters is in its predictable, formulaic script. The story beats are familiar, and the characters' motivations are often reduced to simplistic, one-dimensional goals. The film's themes of redemption and justice are similarly underdeveloped, feeling like an afterthought in the face of the action-oriented plot.Additionally, the film's tone can be inconsistent, veering wildly from intense drama to campy humor. While Cage's antics often provide a welcome respite from the tension, some of the supporting characters' quirks feel like they belong in a different movie altogether.In conclusion, ""Con Air"" is a fun, if flawed, action film that's elevated by its talented cast and impressive stunts. While it doesn't quite reach the heights of other 90s action classics, it's a worthy addition to the genre. If you're a fan of Cage, Cusack, or just looking for a mindless, adrenaline-fueled thrill ride, ""Con Air"" is worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

This is the sort of role he excels at.There is also an appearance by Steve Buscemi as the Marietta Mangler, a serial killer who first appears in the film strapped to a chair with a mask, a la Hannibal Lecter.Nicholas Cage is also good as a very honourable guy who just wants to get home to his wife and child, but not at the expense of his fellow prisoners.This film is worth watching many times - its entertaining, sometimes funny and altogether brilliant!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Put   the bunny   back  in the box!,"Between an Oscar-winning portrayal of a Vegas drunk and an Oscar nominated performance as a tortured screenwriter, Nicholas Cage decided to let out his inner redneck.

Immensely entertaining,"""Con Air"" is like a nice souvenir from that late-'90s sweet spot when Nicolas Cage action movies were good. For my money, this is his ""road House""; the hair, the accent, the roundhouses. It's impossible to take him seriously (and yet he's the sterling hero of the movie) and that applies to the rest of the movie as a whole. One wrong move, and this could be insultingly stupid, But that move never comes, and the absurdity is somehow very appealing. This is a great cast, spouting macho dialogue to a screaming guitar score; violence and explosions all over the place while Cage's cartoon character stares down every last convict.

Flying Guantanamo.,"This film is slightly based on true air travels made to transfer convicted criminals. I think I don't need to say that the idea of ​​a plane full of chains and bars, with criminals traveling like caged beasts, is pure fiction. Despite having a good cast and some regular action scenes, this film has a very poor quality. The script, written by Scott Rosenberg, is too unrealistic and implausible, starting with the totally stupid idea to fill a plane with crazy killers (one wearing a mask out of ""Silence of the Lambs""), side by side with an arsenal of light weapons and fatty policeman full of donuts. This scenario could only end badly, making the hijacking too predictable. I don't understand how the police had so much difficulty in tracking the airplane with so many locators and covert surveillance devices available in that days, on the service of the writers and the director, Simon West. Starting from there, the film only gets worse, with a huge circus of unlikely and unbelievable scenes. The end is worthy of the Razzie Award that this film won.The film has a good cast led by Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich and John Cusack. Also participating, among others, Ving Rhames, Steve Buscemi, Danny Trejo, Renoly Santiago and Dave Chappelle. Nevertheless, none of the characters was particularly interesting with the exception of John Malkovich, who gave his Cyrus all the required malice and wickedness without allowing himself to explore a little more his evil. Some of the characters tries, mainly through dialogue, rehearse a few moments of humor, but it's a shot that backfired. The action scenes are truly impressive, but most merely to show-off, being clogged with special effects and sound.

Comic booky pull-out-all-the-stops action/thriller with Nicolas Cage and John Cusack,"Released in 1997 and directed by Simon West, ""Con Air"" is an action/thriller starring Nicolas Cage as Cameron Poe, a former US Ranger and newly paroled ex-con who finds himself trapped in a prisoner transport plane where the hardened cons seize control, led by the brilliantly insane Cyrus the Virus (John Malkovich). John Cusack and Colm Meaney co-star as the two conflicting officers in charge of resolving the situation. Some of the more notable cons are played by Ving Rhames, Danny Trejo and Steve Buscemi.My title blurb says it all: ""Con Air"" is a no-holds-barred action/thriller with a clever sense of humor in the compelling spirit of 1996's ""Broken Arrow,"" although I give ""Con Air"" the edge. Yes, the story's contrived and the movie's overall cartoony, but it's just so kinetic, amusing and well-executed you're inspired to go with it rather than go against it. In fact, you'll probably find yourself hilariously laughing at moments, particularly in the third act. On top of this, the movie shoots for a little depth with the well-done (and amusing) redemption of a certain con.The weak point is the lack of a quality female role. Sure, there's the guard on the plane played by Rachel Ticotin, but her role is rather one-dimensional; however, I do appreciate a later scene with her and Poe. Monica Potter is on hand as Poe's wife, but her part is limited to standing around looking doe-eyed. Despite this cavil, ""Con Air"" delivers the goods for what it is; and spectacularly so.The movie runs 115 minutes and was shot in Indiana, Utah, Nevada and California.GRADE: A-",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Not even the host of grade A actors recruited could compensate for this true holocaust of simple and predictable story, continuity mistakes, poor and greatly exaggerated special effects, stereotypical characters, unrealistic events, overacting, corny dialog, unmotivated events, etc. The movie has zero artistic value and the only entertainment value is that of self-ridicule. Clearly it was made solely for the purpose of profits. If you liked Speed 2, you will probably like this movie, too.

Steve Buscemi Steals The Show In Classic 1990's Action Flick,"People say a lot of negative things about Jerry Bruckheimer, however the man does know how to produce a solid action flick. Movies like ""Armageddon"", ""Bad Boys"", The Rock"" and ""Con Air"" are all superb action movies of the highest calibre.Plot in A Paragraph: Cameron Poe, a United States Army Ranger, came home to Alabama, only to get in to a drunken brawl defending his pregnant wife from some drunks. Cameron kills one of the drunks and is sent to a federal penitentiary for involuntary manslaughter for seven years. Years later Cameron is released on parole and can now go home to his wife and daughter. Unfortunately, Cameron has is on a prison airplane with some of the country's most dangerous criminals, including Cyrus ""The Virus"" Grissom, who take control of the plane and are now planning to escape the country. Cameron has to find a way to stop them, Meanwhile, United States Marshal Vincent Larkin is trying to help Cameron and stop a DEA agent shooting the plane down.Nicolas Cage (who was delivered some ropey performances to say the least over the years) is at his best here, John Cusack is excellent as Vince Larkin and John Malkovich is as usual excellent self as the main villain Cyrus The Virus.Ving Rhames (who never disappoints) offers solid support as Diamond Dog, likewise Danny Trejo. Colm Rainey is effectively annoying, while Mykleti Williamson, Dave Chapelle and Rachel Ticotin are all good in supporting roles. Renoly Santiago is a lot of fun,However it is Steve Buescemi who completely steals the show as Garland Greene.I also need to mention the song ""How Do I Live"" which I didn't stop singing when this movie was released, and usually is stuck in my head for a while every time I watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"In four words...""Why was it made?"",","The storyline of this movie is anything but original. It must have plundered (if not exactly plagiarised) at least a dozen previous scripts, and is inferior to most of them, and I really can't savvy why Nicholas Cage, an actor of real ability, got involved in the movie at all (except perhaps for money). As the anti-hero he looked more anti than hero.The decision taken to collectively transport some of the country's supposedly most dangerous convicts in one aircraft would surely never have been contemplated by the real U.S. authorities. One would hope not.The action moves at quite a pace, which is probably just as well, as it doesn't give the viewer time to consider it's many faults, not least of which is the ludicrousness of the whole package. Personally I cannot understand the obsession of modern Amercan movie-makers to produce and glorify this type of violent pap, or for that matter of the American public in watching it.Except for a re-vamping of the usual ""good against evil"" theme (or could it perhaps be for the enhancement of bad language?), this film (I hesitate to call it entertainment) seems to serve no purpose whatsoever. I can't see one valid point it's trying to make. Not that a justification is always necessary, but this garbage is just violence for the sake of violence, and there's no worse reason for a film to be made.

One of the worst movies I have seen,"Could a movie get any worse? I have never cared much for Nicolas cage, and this is one of the reasons I did not see Con Air in the past. Well tonight I was flipping thru the channels when I saw the show on one of the cable channels. I paused for a few moments to see what it was, after a few moments I discovered what it was, I decided to watch a few minutes to see if it was as bad as I imagined. Well it went beyond my wildest dreams. It is bad. The part I was subjected to was, as I guessed near the end of the show. Cage was trying to get to a plane in the bone yard, I am assuming that this the bone yard in Tucson Az. If so it looked nothing like the bone yard; I have had the opportunity to visit it myself when I was a training mission at Davis-MonthanAFB, These two are adjacent to each other. If the military is going to be sending in troops it would send in a lot more then the few it did, plus there would be no civilian police cars in the parade. But then this would not make for a so-called action movie. I turned it off right after the Corvette hit the ground. That was about all I could take. I just hope that they did not destroy a real Vette, in the making of the movie. There is now way that plane would have been able to takeoff let alone fly with that car tethered to it.

"""Con Air"" - What a wild ride!","I have to say that 1997's Jerry Bruckheimer-produced, Simon West-directed ""Con Air"" is one of the best action films to come out during the cynical, seen-it-all late '90s. The film is over-the-top with over-the-top characters, dialogue and situations that are just too over-the-top to be truly believable and deliberately so. But damn it, is this movie good and endlessly re-watchable - 14 long years after the fact!True to most Bruckheimer productions (it was only just Bruckheimer at this point because his long-time business partner Don Simpson had only just passed away the year before during their time on 1996's Michael Bay-directed ""The Rock,"" and that film was dedicated to his memory), ""Con Air"" is loud, crazy, and there is not anything even remotely close to resembling a brain cell in sight during its 122-minute running time (this review is based on the extended version). But like I said, damn this movie is really good.""Con Air"" begins in the aftermath of the U.S. military's Operation Desert Storm in 1991, and U.S. Army Ranger Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) has just returned home to Mobile, Alabama, after his tour of duty overseas. Before he can break out the celebrations with his pregnant wife Tricia (Monica Potter), he gets into a drunken brawl with three locals and kills one of them. An unsympathetic judge sentences Cameron to no less than seven to 10 years behind bars for his crime.Eight years passes and the day Cameron has eagerly awaited has finally come: he's been paroled, and he's on his way home to reunite with Tricia and see his young daughter Casey (Landry Allbright) for the very first time on her birthday (July 14). He's hitching a ride home on the U.S. Marshal's prisoner-transport plane, The Jailbird, along with his buddy Mike ""Baby-O"" O'Dell (Mykelti Williamson). This same flight is a special one, because it is also transporting some of this country's most lethal criminal offenders to a brand-new maximum-security penitentiary in Alabama - a place that has been ""designed to house the worst of the worst... most of these guys are lifers, some on death row,"" one official exclaims.Some of these ""colorful,"" over-the-top characters Cameron and ""Baby-O"" are sharing this ride with include arsonist and dope addict Joe ""Pinball"" Parker (comedian Dave Chappelle), who is actually one of the least dangerous of all these hardened criminals and is essentially a nice guy; the notorious serial rapist ""Johnny-23"" (Danny Trejo) - ""23"" standing for 23 counts of rape - and who has his eyes set on the flight's sole female, Guard Sally Bishop (Rachel Ticotin); Nathan ""Diamond Dog"" Jones (Ving Rhames), a former general in a black militant organization who blew up an NRA meeting; mass murderer William ""Billy Bedlam"" Bedford (Nick Chinlund), who proudly boasts that he's serving eight consecutive life sentences for killing his cheating wife's entire family, even the dog; the soft-spoken, yet weaselly Hannibal Lecter-wannabe Garland Green (the weaselly Steve Buscemi), ""The Marietta Mangler,"" who went on a serial-killing spree that spanned up and down the entire Eastern seaboard; and the notorious criminal mastermind Cyrus ""Cyrus the Virus"" Grissom (John Malkovich), ""who likes to brag that he's killed more men than cancer.""Predictably, some of these convicts, led by ""The Virus,"" get loose during the middle of the flight, kill some of the guards and take control of the plane, which he not-so-subtly re-names ""Con Air"" for a trip to a non-extradition country somewhere south of the border. Cameron and ""Baby-O"" realize they're in way over their heads on this flight. Meanwhile on the ground, U.S. Marshal Vince Larkin (John Cusack) clashes with DEA Agent Duncan Malloy (Colm Meaney) over how to bring the situation to a resolution that will hopefully please everybody but it appears that the only one capable of saving the day is Cameron.""Con Air"" is loud, brash, and over-the-top (did I say that it was over-the-top already several times?). It's hard to believe that Michael Bay WASN'T in the director's chair this time, since it contains many of his trademarks including fast editing, crazy characters, outlandish dialogue, stunning action sequences, explosions, car chases, and shootouts. What involvement he had, if any, on this picture is unclear, but it is clear that Simon West definitely took his cues from Bay and definitely knew how to stage the picture in his vain. That goes to show you Bay's influence in movies these days.Cage is good in another one of his trademark low-key performances, since this action flick was made to cash in on his massive popularity following his Oscar win for ""Leaving Las Vegas"" (1995). It's clear the actor worked pretty hard on his Southern accent and hand-to-hand combat skills as well as his physical appearance in order to beef up for the role. The actors playing the convicts seem to be having the most fun here, though, and let loose with over-the-top (there's that hyphenate again!) theatrics and performances, especially the lunatic criminal mastermind Cyrus the Virus played by John Malkovich. He's made a career out of playing creepy, compelling psychopathic bad guys (like in ""In the Line of Fire""), and with his role as the steely-eyed ""The Virus,"" he has more cause to celebrate as this is one of his greatest portrayals of movie villainy.""Con Air"" is one boldly energetic and exciting action flick. I've seen the movie well over a dozen times since it first came out in 1997 and it's never lost its luster or ability to be exciting, brain-dead entertainment. Trust me, it's one wild ride you'll want to take again and again!10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Effective OTT action caper,"""Con Air"" is a film that inhabits the alternative universe where everything is highly combustible, bad guys are always larger-than-life and have a talent for quips, heroes can defy the laws of gravity and probability, and vehicles of all shapes and sizes have a tendency to crash spectacularly. There is nothing ostensibly wrong with this kind of film, but it is not for everyone, and some may be annoyed with the lack of reality as the stunts and improbable events pile up higher and higher.The movie is one of the better specimens of the over-the-top sub-genre of action movies, mainly due to an excellent cast list and a very fluid sense of direction. The editing hardly puts a scene wrong, and the plot holds the attention for a good two-thirds before it slides into ludicrous, badly-orchestrated overdrive at the end. One of the biggest bugbears is that some major plot points are overlooked along the way, such as who helped the bad guys obtain materials like plans of the plane, etc.Nicolas Cage does reasonably well in a role that is effectively a rewritten John McClane, but the clothes do not quite fit him right, and neither does the Deep South accent. While it would be very easy to see Bruce Willis romping around the plane if this were another ""Die Hard"" sequel, there is something just a little off-key with Cage's character, an Army Ranger who is being paroled after seven years of a ten-year sentence for killing a man in a bar-room fight. This may partly be due to the over-emphasis on sugary romance featuring his wife and the daughter he has never met. It's possible to get behind Cage as he takes on the bad guys, but he just isn't as likable as McClane.On the other side of the cast, Malkovich and Buscemi both play very effective, believable psychopaths, and a scene of Buscemi's freed character stalking a little girl is among the most tension-filled in the film. The rest of the cast largely play their parts effectively.If you are willing to delve deep enough  and you do not need to examine the movie too closely to spot them  the flaws are there, as the goofs section indicates. Depending on your tolerance for a film to deliver an entertaining story over being entirely realistic or accurate, this may or may not be a problem. Most things considered, ""Con Air"" has a lot going for it, the least of which being that it is neither ""Air Force One"" or ""Executive Decision"" to name but two fellow (and inferior) high-octane action movies featuring airplanes.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Rambo takes to the skies,"Con Air is your typical crash, bang, wallop Jerry Bruckheimer kind of movie. Loud & blatant pyrotechniques, lots of shouting and bad language; a dumb-downed script, actors act by the join-the-dots method, and not a lot of subtlety.The plot, such as it is, has the worst kind of scum all being dumped on the same plane as Mr Nice Guy, Nic, who has just served a 7 year jail term on a jumped up charge.There's lots of stern faces, flexed biceps & fixed stares, but you begin to wonder who is using the brain cell between this motley crew.Nic Cage acts like sly stallone & Bruce Willis rolled into one with equal numbness but ends up like Hommer Simpson and gives us the impression he'd rather be somewhere else. (""Duh, put....duh...the....bunny...duh....back!"")Cage talks like an old-fashioned LP playing at the wrong speed; Cussack & Meaney are the comic relief who spend most of their time calling each other a__holes & much worse along with lots of running/flying around.Buscemi is always fun to watch - a bit like the whining kid in the classroom; and here he thinks his Hannibal the Cannibal with a fixed smirk and a worrying choice of bondage-wear.The only person I really felt for was John Malkovich - playing the chief baddie with the loaned-out brain cell. You just knew he was only in the movie for the money and not to stretch his considerable acting talent. But to be fair he played the part with gusto and in real life would have kicked Cage (and his fluffy bunny) into touch!This film would suit those people who like a crazy Saturday night at home with the gang and a few tinnies. There's just no point in being critical for its lack of intelligence because that would miss the point.Con Air is hokum pure & simple, and yet its fun to watch when you want to unwind big time.

"You're not meant to take it seriously, so buckle up and enjoy the ride!","Con Air was one of my favourite movies growing up and to this day I still enjoy watching it from time to time. Con Air was another reason Nicolas Cage was one of my favourite actors as a teenager, although nowadays not so much. Con Air is still enjoyable eye candy with non stop action, explosions, and crackling one liners. John Malkovich is a delight as the lead villain and John Cusack who is normally well known for comedies and dramatic films did great in his first action movie.Former Army Ranger Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage, The Rock) is sentenced to 10 years in prison after he kills a drunken lout who accosts him and his pregnant wife Trish (Monica Potter, Along Came a Spider), despite the fact Cameron was acting in self defence. After being paroled after 8 years and keen to meet his daughter that he has never met, Cameron is flown to Alabama on board the Jailbird along with a number of dangerous criminals being flown to a new maximum security prison. The assortment of criminals include Cyrus ""Cyrus The Virus"" Grissom (John Malkovich, In the Line of Fire), Nathan ""Diamond Dog"" Jones (Ving Rhames, Pulp Fiction), John ""Johnny 23"" Baca (Danny Trejo, Heat), William ""Billy Bedlam"" Bedford (Nick Chinlund, Training Day), Joe ""Pinball"" Parker (Dave Chappelle, The Dave Chappelle Show), ""Swamp Thing"" Williams (M. C. Gainey, Breakdown), and Garland Greene (Steve Buscemi, Boardwalk Empire). While Cameron tries to keep his head down and stop the crisis, he also works to protect his diabetic friend Baby-O (Mykelti Williamson, Forrest Gump) as well as the guards kept hostage including Sally Bishop (Rachel Ticotin, Total Recall). Meanwhile on the ground, US Marshal Vince Larkin (John Cusack, Grosse Point Blank) must also work to stop the criminals from escaping custody however his efforts are hampered by headstrong DEA Agent Duncan Malloy (Colm Meaney, Under Siege) who is eager to have the plane obliterated from the sky.Following the success of the blockbuster hit The Rock (1996), Nicolas Cage's career kicked into another gear in the late 1990's with Con Air. His accent may be a bit dodgy, but Cage looks impressive after pumping iron for his role as Cameron Poe and getting involved with doing his own stunts. John Cusack who is well known for romantic comedies such as Say Anything...(1989) does a great job as US Marshall Vince Larkin who seems like the only ally he has is Cameron Poe in taking down the dangerous convicts who have seized control of the Jailbird. John Malkovich who has always been a quality actor sinks his teeth into his role as Cyrus the Virus and comes up with all the cool one liners throughout the movie. The rest of the supporting cast including Ving Rhames, Danny Trejo and Steve Buscemi also do a fantastic job in their respective roles.Simon West makes his directorial debut with Con Air and it is unfortunate that he hasn't hit the same heights of success with his subsequent movies with movies such as The General's Daughter (1999), Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), and The Expendables 2 (2012). Con Air would also be the first movie produced by the then-newly established Jerry Bruckheimer Studios after Jerry Bruckheimer went solo following the tragic death of his producing partner Don Simpson in 1996.Con Air is everything that is to like about blockbusting action movies. One where you can just sit back and enjoy all the action. The story and some of the acting may be divisive, but put all of that aside and enjoy the fun.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

And more recently I did enjoy Cage in Adaptation. However, in this piece of claptrap he is ""the hero"" Camerone Poe, which is such a fake sounding name, by the way. Then again, it fits, because the whole movie is filled with these paper thin ""bad guys"" who are so one-note jokes. Buscemi is the only one who somewhat elevates the material to something watchable, and even then it's just barely. Monica Potter plays the wife of Cage, and she is nothing but vapid airiness as well.

faster and more"" were the ultimate goal for him to generate budget and conquer audiences. I'm not saying that he doesn't do that anymore, but there's a certain
distance from the times he delivered the likes of ""Crimson Tide"", ""The Rock"" and ""Bad Boys"" where the sense of adventure, real danger, spectacular sequences and
stellar casts were the main attraction even if the story didn't deliver much, lacked of bigger brains and as usual, countless jump cuts and plot holes - he's still
delivering more of the same but the quality of the material, the charm and innocence of the 1990's flicks (the lack of political correctness was a major turn on too)
were all gone; the team he has now, the directors and actors on his productions are too softened in those days where he basically lives of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"",
some other franchises and super heroes who are the name of the game now. Action films were made with more humans beings than CGI. And that's why ""Con Air"", despite its numerous flaws,
still stands out as a supreme moment in terms of entertainment, quality and memorable moments.The basics: Golf War veteran Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) spends some time in jail after accidentally killing a man who was messing around with him and his wife
(Monica Potter). When jail time's over, free is at the door when he takes a ride on a plane filled with the most horrendous and dangerous criminals, and their plan,
meticulously conceived by Cyrus ""the Virus"" Grissom (a hilarious yet menacing John Malkovich) is to take over the airplane and escape from authorities. After all, the
majority of the group have long sentences to complete while Cameron is going on parole and his greatest wish is to return home to wife and the daughter he never met.
The hijack works and suddenly our hero Poe is destined to alert the good guys down there about what is going on. One of the guys is Vince Larkin (John Cusack), supervisor
of the flight and a good man who has the thankless job of dealing with the unpleasant presence of a careless Narcotics chief (Colm Meaney, also hilarious) who put an
inside man on the plane to track down the schemes of a powerful drug dealer. It's total chaos but for us in the audience is an endless thrills to joy the ride, how
Cameron is gonna make his good plan to work; how Cyrus' dangerous plan is going to work; and how Larkin is gonna manage to do his job without being bossed around by
clueless bureatric people.Gotta put into account that ""Con Air"" was a baby created to be pleasant to its creators (obviously) and to ourselves as long we don't get too demanding on
what the film brings to us. One action sequence tops the other, it's extremely fast paced yet perfectly edited, a insanely sense of humor with one countless cheesy lines
and dialogues (never cringeworthy), and to the ones expecting some message behind all those rushes, changes and gunshots there's a positive message behind it all:
there's always someone with good intentions trying to make the best of nightmarish situations. Poe is not the selfish hero who just wants to leave the plan and go
back home; he's the one who always finds means to spread the message of a taken flight to the police and also save his sick friend (Mykelti Williamson) and the female
guard (Rachel Ticotin), hostage of the bad guys. And the Cusack character comes in a high and might intellectual way, though always knowing best but when it's time to
act he becomes a man of action. As for the humor relief - though ""Con Air"" is not as heavy as one may think - Malkovich delivers all the goods, along with the ad-libs
from Dave Chappelle and the frightening Hannibal Lecter-traits coming from scene stealer Steve Buscemi. I grew up watching this and the forementioned films to the point
where I can watch repeatedly and the pleasure it's always the same. I might discover one or two new things, overlooked points, lots of errors obviously but I never get
tired of it. It reached to a point that few current films hardly ever get, which is to make you revisit the film time and again, absorb everything and that enjoyable
thing where you can repeat the most memorable lines every time you watch it. Not saying it's the greatest script ever written, but there's excellent quality stuff
that never gets out of your head (""Put the bunny in the box"" or Buscemi's definition of irony when people are having fun while listening to Lynyrd Skynyrd).The core of this review goes to show how nostalgic one can be with a movie. I guess the majority of current viewers are only accostumed to see Nicolas Cage
wasting his talent with ""only in it for the movie"" flicks and forget that for some decades he was a truly great actor, not just in action movies as this one and
""Face/Off"" but also a heavyweight actor for all seasons in ""Leaving Las Vegas"", ""Moonstruck"" and ""Adaptation."". I must say ""Con Air"" joins the list of his best movies;
along with John Cusack who also was at one time a talented fella but his current wave of dark characters simply don't appeal to me. His heroic character is smart,
likeable and it's worth the adrenaline he goes through while following the plane's movements. I mean, let us be honest: how many times in recent you looked back at
a highly charged action flick that had all those best elements combined that made the profit this one had? The difference is that audiences don't care much about
getting lost in the enthusiam and the fun filmmakers are delivering to us, now we all follow only intelligent action films that lose in appeal or quality here and
elsewhere (sometimes they're not even all that good). And a pity that director Simon West (unknown at the time) never repeated a similar feat with his next films, they
were all dull and empty - but made money, possibly launched some careers.In all honesty, heart of hearts, ""Con Air"" is one of the most exciting, humorous and heart-pounding action/adventure films of all time in my book. It brings the best of me in so many ways, I get the laughs, the suspense and I can even enjoy all the unbelievable goofs and silliness of it all - the descent in Las Vegas tops everything - and admire how bald West/Bruckheimer et all brought to the screen. Fasten your seatbelts, enjoy the flight and apllaud at the end. You probably haven't feel this good in ages with a movie in the past decade. Just maybe. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Sirus the Virus!!!,"Con-air can be viewed upon as the sequel to ""The Rock"" because of the following things: 1) it has the same star(N. Cage) and producer(J. Bruckheimer) as ""The Rock"" 2) storywise it can easily be what happened to Nicolas Cage's character from ""The Rock, after he escaped Alcatraz. Nicolas Cage plays Cameron Poe, a military-officer who kills a man to protect his wife. Poe is sentenced to 7 years in prison. 7 years later he is going aboard a plane called ""con-air"", which will be taking him back to his wife and daughter. Everything is not running smoothly though, as the other convicts take over the plane. Poe does not want to be a part of the hijacking so he does what he can to prevent the plain from reaching the destination set by the other convicts, and he tries to tell the police where they are heading. The film has plenty of cool actionscenes and two quality actors(Cage and Malcowich). However, the movie is not as good as ""The Rock"", and the music is lame when compared to ""the Rock's"" soundtrack. It must still be said that Con-air is a very good movie and one of the best American actionmovies of 1997. Rent it! 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Another Great 90's Action Film!,"Along with other greats from the late 80's and 90's such as Die Hard and Lethal Weapon, this movie joins that group of amazing movies. This is what you call a typical action movie. There are tons of explosions and really menacing bad guys.Basically, a group of prisoners decide to take over the plane they're being transported on. They want to escape for their freedom in sunshine and sand. But, one of the prisoners is on his way home due to parole. He wants to make sure that he sees his wife and daughter again. He will do anything it takes.The strongest point of the movie is the acting. The acting is full of well-known actors such as Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, and John Malkovich. Malkovicn can really play an intimidating bad guy. I wouldn't want to cross his path. Cage and Cusack were also very good.I liked the music of the film. I wonder how the song by Tricia Yearwood can be nominated for both an Oscar and a Razzie award. I liked that song. Overall, this is a great action film and a one to watch over and over again.

Like I said many things didn't made enough sense, but that's not important when it has so many great action sequences (most of them were in the second half of the movie). The direction was great. I heard positive and negative responses about Simon West, but after watching this movie, I realised what a great director he actually is.

One of the top ten worst big-budget films (possibly the worst) ever!  POS!,"Con Air is the type of movie that separates film-goers into 2 distinct camps: Those who think or dare to say aloud, ""this film has it ALL"" and those who feel as if a chunk of their ""life force"" has been forever stolen. The latter leaves the TV room or, worse, the theatre weak, angry, and sad for the state of cinematic art in the western world. Expertly ruined by director, Simon West, Con Air at first glance has the look and feel of a crummy, jingoistic Michael Bay film, crammed with slo-mo, gratuitous violence, testosterone, low-rent style, and zero substance. We watch, uncaring, as sell-out actor Nick Cage struggles to stay alive in an airborne turbo-prop chock full of prison socio-pathology. He's a former bad boy who's trying to pay his dues in a world that's ""totally out of his control!"" If I had to single out only one defect in this abortion of entertainment, it would be the unnecessarily-large ensemble of otherwise accomplished actors. This is a recent trend in Hollywood: Get a separate actor to over-play each separate emotion in the colorful rainbow of human experience, like in that rocket-powered reel of pure excrement, Armageddon. In Con Air, it's the ""criminal"" version of the trend. One guy is the genius psychopath (the worst on record), another eats faces (the fastest eater of faces around), and so on. In summation, this whole miasma of poorly-conceived, infantile ideas is an insult to a thinking person's intelligence. And, anybody who likes it or had anything to do with its creation should be bashed squarely in the teeth. Insert sound effect of crunching bone here.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime

If this happens, Con Air would most definitely be the ace up the sleeve of the prosecution. Its egregiousness is astounding, almost hypnotic.It is the celluloid equivalent of the scene in The Simpsons where Bart writes: 'INSERT BRAIN HERE' on the back of Homer's head, Homer runs in circles, frantically trying to see the back of his own head.

Greatest Movie Ever,"This movie ranks number one on my top 9 movies list.  What could be better than this movie?  Nothing.  It had an all star cast, and had the most original plot of any movie.  No other movie has had a group of convicts hijacking an airplane before (Ignore the movie US Marshalls and a few other exceptions).  But honestly, this was the greatest acting performance by Nicolas Cage ever.  It is a shame he didn't win an academy award for best actor.  And how about that John Malkovich.  He played a psycho criminal so well, that if you saw him in real life, you would crap your pants on the spot.  Dave Chapelle was wonderful too, playing an all too fitting role of a crackhead, just added to the realism.  Then there was Colm Meaney. Everyone knows him from being that guy in Under Siege, and his new upcoming role playing apart from Seagal again in the yet to be released Half Passed Dead (I know good movies, and let me tell you, HPD will be number 6 on my top 9 list, and I haven't even seen it yet).  Nobody can forget John Cusack being the anal retentive ""nature boy"" policeman.  Ving Rames played a convincing criminal as well.  But the greatest character in this movie was Steve Buscemi.  Little do you know, but Buscemi was not acting in this movie, he actually is like that in real life.But enough of the cast, back to the plot.  What an amazing scenario, to have the criminals overtake an airplane and try to free themselves with Nick Cage (who is in the Italian-American Hall of Fame mind you) stuck in the middle of all of it.  You must watch this movie to see what predicaments the criminals get themselves into, and how Nick Cage, aided by Cusack and Meaney on the ground, tries to thwart their plans.  I feel this movie should have won multiple academy awards for best writing.  The dialogue between characters, especially Malkovich, was nothing short of phenominal.  So while I sit here and write my second comment for this movie, YOU need to go watch it.  I guarantee your life will be complete upon seeing this movie.A Masterpiece.  Belongs in the Walt Disney hall of fame. 45,000 stars out of a possible 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Yes, it is a slighty Lecter-inspired performance, (but who cares, Steve Buscemi is a much better actor than Anthony Hopkins). As for Cage's accent, well I'm not American, I've never been to America, and I thought it was pretty good, however I'm sure there are a lot of Americans who would beg to differ.You don't have to understand the details.

Oh the nineties,"Con Air really coins the term ""stupid action blockbuster"".It is held together by great cast (performances) and insane action. It is stupid, but it's still somewhat entertaining and childishly romantic.While it's clearly not going to top any 90ties action lists, it is still watchable (or re-watchable if you saw it as a kid or young adult in the 90ties).Obviously the plot is full of holes, but it's sufficient for an action film (especially a 90ties one). The only distracting or rather confusing thing was the teleportation and insane continuity errors. It's like Schrödinger's cat, when our characters are not on screen they disappear from their relative position and re-appear when we start looking. Nobody is anywhere consistently and this provides for some funny situations.It was also very weird for me to see Cage as a ripped action hero and for me he looks kinda comical in these roles (like in Face/Off, same year).

Well he stays for a while, but now it is time for his freedom, unfortunately the more dangerous criminals want their freedom as well and they end up hijacking said airplane and taking it over. Lots of action in this one, liked ""The Rock"" better, but this one has something better in it, in that it has a better bad guy played by the always good John Malkovich. It also has a whole lot of other stars too, Cusak, Ving Rames, Steve Buschemi, and even Dave Chappalle in a small but funny role.

It has excellent characters played to perfection, such as John Malkovich as 'Sirus the Virus', and Steve Buschemi as 'Garland Green' aka 'The Marietta Mangler'. The action races along with little release, and yes it can be seen as a little cliché, as it's about a good guy has some bad luck to end up in jail, then just when he's going home to his family hits some more bad luck and has to save the day, but I defy anyone not to be impressed when Cage's character continues to storm ahead without flinching, after been shot in the arm.

Negative criticism was so overwhelmingly abundant that I will not even attempt to elaborate on what was already there, except to say that it felt like a relief to locate something else that at least made a reasonable amount of sense by comparison.

The slow southern drawl,"I really like this movie. No, no, no seriously. I really do. If Nick Cage talks any slower I would . . .fall . . .asleep. But it works perfectly. Okay, obviously this movie was not made with the intention for the movie makers to end up standing behind a microphone thanking their agents. It was simply made to entertain, and that it does. John Malcovich (spelling?) is not his usually stiff self and he really lights up the screen as Cyrus the Virus.One of the things that makes this movie work is its vast cast of characters from Steve Buscemi as Garland Greene, or Dave Chappelle as Pinball, all the way to John Cusak (YES!) as U.S. Marshal Vince Larkin, not one of his regular roles. I am so glad that he decided to do this movie however, because he really breathes life into this film, er I mean, Movie.And with all it's explosions, and cheesy action dialog, I still have a hard time not crying at the end.

Extremely incredible,"No doubt this film has been ""nominated for 2 Oscars, another 6 wins & 8 nominations"". It really is incredible, and I love it very much. Actually I happened to have watched this movie in 1997 with my siblings, but as a teenager who fancied only comedies, this movie was therefore not very enjoyable back then. However, after watching it for the second time last weekend, I should say Con Air is definitely a 'two thumbs up'. It has lots of action, and although with strong violence and language, the storyline is actually great and quite emotional in the end. Being in prison for 8 years and as a father who has never met his own daughter, u'd imagine how eager Poe would be to go home and meet his family. But when his release came, unfortunately his original flight was delayed and he had to be placed in a transport plane carrying a cargo of convicts including the most dangerous criminals like Cyrus the Virus and his gangs.

Peak nineties action movie - timelessly energetic and fun,"This film couldn't be any more 90s action movie, and I love it for it. Before superhero movies and the boomer action hero franchises swarmed cinema, we just had movies like this.A simpler time, with real explosions, ridiculous set pieces and three dimensional characters. And actors like Nicolas Cage and John Cusack (remember him?) At the absolute top of their powers.This movie really has it all, a noble, courageous and unlucky main hero, a genius but unpredictable villain (played with great relish by John Malkovich) and a wide cast of criminals and cops which all play a role, and funnily enough none seem unecessary or forced. One liners don't always hit but the cheesiness adds to the appeal. Even the slow motion and long Nicholas Cage hair just make it that much more fun. Recommend.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good solid entertainment,"This is one of those movies which are simply good solid entertainment. The fact that I do like Nicolas Cage, even though he is at times really lousy at choosing which movies he participate in, is of course an additional plus.Naturally I do like the performance of Nicolas Cage in this movie but John Malkowich is also great as the main bad guy and Steve Buscemi is perfect as the nutcase although his role could have been a bit more expanded upon. The rest of the actors are doing nicely as well although it always saddens me to see Colm Meaney playing a dumbass and/or bad guy after his role in Star Trek.The story is not really bad although it has the usual Hollywood mistakes here and there. The ease by which they pick locks in this high security flight is somewhat laughable and I seriously doubt that they would have been able to haul the plane out of that desert junkyard in flyable condition in real life for instance. Still, it is not a bad story and it works for moving the movie forward.There are plenty of action and it is mostly quite entertaining. Sometimes it is a bit silly and rather unrealistic of course but, as I wrote, mostly it is quite entertaining. The ending is definitely a bit on the silly side with the plane touching down on the Las Vegas Strip. This bit felt like the producers realized that they had some FX budget left and just had to burn it.Anyway, on the whole a quite entertaining movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
perfect job,"I think, that the characters of the actors where just perfect. i could not think of any other actor on any place in the movie. And what i think was the most interesting thing is that Cyrus the main bad guy was played by an actor who never really a good action actor, he is more of a ""thinker"", than a ""doer"". But in this he was just really good.Cameron was a little less than i thought, but it was great to see, that he was shown as a father, who can be fight with, and got hurt by 3 drunk man, on the ground... The reason why i think he was a little less than he should be is because his face was not shown the emotion he felt. I mean i know that he was a ranger and as a profession soldier he can not show any of this but he was in the jail for 8 years. And his wife didn't grow old...But I thing it was just really good...",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
failure,"this movie sucks because Johh Malkovitch sits there and acts crazy, but sounds more homo than homicidal, it's not realistic(I don't have to explain that one), and everyone is running around just trying to squeeze out some one liner thats going to somehow make it worth watching. Steve Buschemi in in the movie, technically, but because he does almost nothing, I left wondering why? Why would they throw him in there, make him so scary, and have him do nothing. I didn't find the characters realistic; I left the movie feeling like I'd just watched a fantasy flick instead of an action movie. This just not that good of a movie.

The epitome of action.,"Con Air must be said to be a genuine action flick. Jerry Bruckheimer really knows how to impress his audience, with previous action hits like The Rock and Top Gun, and now Con Air. Scott Rosenberg's electric screenplay is the aspect of Con Air that really sets it alone. Smart, inventive, and downright entertaining, Rosenberg presents a story that takes us back to films like The Wild Bunch and the Dirty Dozen, where we get to know all the characters and get to like them all too. Bruckheimer and director Simon West really pile on the hardware, and make Con Air one of the most appealing and best looking films of 1997. The aspect of maximum security prisoners- including murderers, rapists, and serial killers- really appeals to teenage audiences. But despite their crimes, the characters become quite lovable, which then turns Con Air into an action/comedy. Spectacular action scenes on the plane, in the desert, and most importantly, Las Vegas, really make Con Air a top action movie. Although containing some love scenes, it doesn't drag Con Air down much more than any other movie. Con Air's film editing is quick and effective, adding another action movie aspect to it. Con Air really gets the audience involved in the movie, and never lets the audience stop and think. It's real in-your-face action, which never lets up. Con Air is really a prime example of the action genre.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

I kept watching,"Via on demand, digital cable, and premium channels, I always have zillions of movies at my fingertips -- but rarely watch any of them for more than a few minutes. The last movie I watched on TV from beginning to end before Con Air was the extraordinary Master and Commander -- I saw it in the theater and liked it even better re-viewing it on HBO on demand. The closest I usually come to watching movies at home are watching some of the great HBO series like Carnivale, which have a movie-like feel to them.Now Con Air is a silly, formulaic movie. But I found it engaging and entertaining from beginning to end. They throw so much at you that there is plenty to like, unless you're trying to be a movie critic...It was not a movie that was intended to be taken seriously -- that's obvious as minute by minute the movie gets progressively more over-the-top and fantastic in the second half. You know more or less what's going to happen, the only question is ""how?"" The characters are mere sketches -- Con Air is pure viewing pablum.But the wonderful cast effortlessly handle their formulaic roles -- and of course the action is non-stop to the point of being ridiculous.

Obviously it's not the only one, but I find that with films like 'Lethal Weapon', although it's another good film, it takes a while for the action to start.The film is about a man, Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) who was imprisoned for manslaughter, When he is released, he flies home on a plane with a group of criminals and terrorists who take control of the plane. It's up to Poe to regain control, and make sure the bad guys don't escape... and he does just that... except for one man!!

I watched it on TNT and even with some of the cuss words bleeped out, this movie obviously has to have used the f-word more than any other movie.

There is also quite a few uses of the N-word as well.My other complaint is Nicholas Cage's horrendous southern accent. Being from the south, I don't think I have ever heard a more fake and overdone accent. I don't think anyone has talked that brand of southern accent since the Civil War. They could have easily made him from somewhere else in the U.S. without negatively impacting the story one bit. It would have been much better to have him in a believable speaking voice than a ridiculous one.Also, what was with the music?! I thought the electronic, synthesized background music went out with the 80's (a la ""Top Gun""). Yet this movie was made in 1997?

A high octane fast pace movie.,"Cameron Poe, who is a highly decorated United States Army Ranger came to his home of Alabama to his wife, Tricia. Only to run into a few drunken regulars at where Tricia works. Cameron unknowingly kills one of the drunks and was sent to a federal penitentiary for involuntary manslaughter for seven years. Then, Cameron became eligible for parole and can now go home to his wife and daughter, Casey. Unfortunately, Cameron has to share a prison airplane with some of the most dangerous criminals in the country, who somehow took control of the plane and are now planning to escape the country with the plane. Cameron has to find a way to stop them while playing along. Meanwhile, United States Marshal Vincent Larkin is trying to help Cameron get free and stop the criminals including, Cyrus ""The Virus"" Grissom. ""Con Air"" is an action packed movie. There are remarkable actors, and yes, while the story is predictable and the stunts are over the top, nevertheless, I think anyone can enjoy this movie and just have fun watching it.

Solid and Tense Entertainment,Like a roller coaster you love to ride it makes you clench your teeth and scream... for more. This is solid entertainment. I am surprised at how many times I have _re-watched_ this action thriller. When I first saw it I liked it and all. At first I thought it was just 'ok' but after a while I started to see the details and the intricacy of the action and the tension.Add to that the few (tastefully done) moments with humor. E.g. the Corvette and how to define irony. You will laugh out loud - if briefly - because Nicolas Cage's acting brings you right back to the action. 8/10-Zafoid,8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"if you say a word about this over the radio, the next wings you see will belong to the flies buzzing over your rotting corpse","Con Air is a 1997 action thriller about a group of prisoners who overtake an airplane transporting them in an attempt to gain their freedom. But one inmate already close to release, doesn't go along with the plan.The first twenty minutes or so is a nice build up to the nonstop thrill ride the movie becomes once it gets going. It has an All Star cast including Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich, and John Cusack. With nice supporting roles from Steve Buscemi, Dave Chappelle, and Mykelti Williamson.As far as action films go, this one sits right at the top with the rest in my opinion. The story is creative, the characters are intense and keep things interesting, and it's filled with everything one would expect from this genre. It's a fast paced action classic that keeps the adrenaline flowing all the way to the very end.If you haven't seen this before, I'd definitely recommend giving it a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A pure thrill ride from start to finish!!,"Nicholas Cage has proven himself as an action star in my mind. What he gives you, that you won't get from people like Arnie and Van Damme etc, is the ability to convincingly play a character with more than two dimensions, he can easily do roles in action films with his eyes closed as the characters do not require to much stretching. Of course when it comes to the action itself he has been doubled too much for my liking. Although he was pretty good in Con Air it must be said, Cage was in great shape in this movie. He has been in three classic action films. This, Face Off and the Rock. In The Rock and Face Off he was doubled annoyingly every second, but he is more involved in this film. Basically Con Air is your typicle macho man action flick, full of one-liners and angry stares but what sets this apart is the amazing energy produced by the direction, set pieces and the standard of actors you don't usually get in this genre. Nic Cage is good although his accent is a little difficult to take in at times, he gets it spot on but it just doesn't suit him. Also John Cusack is in great form as an FBI agent who is responsible for the plane that subsequantly becomes hi-jacked and terrorist controlled. As for the villiansof the piece, well Ving Rhames stars as Diamond Dog and is very good and John Malkovich excels as lead baddie Cyrus the Virus (all the bad guys have stupid names). This film has many of the stupid cliches of the action genre but the amazing action sequences, quality score and the stars make this a must see. The plot may be thin but do we really care in an action flick. Overall this is a great flick, and I really appreciate those few action flicks that employ top actors to add something in that department. Some of the scenes really raise the excitment levels pretty high. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

John Malkovich is suitably menacing alongside Ving Rhames and Steve Buscemi, each in their own way of course, and John Cusak does a decent 'good cop' performance as well.The final act goes on for quite a while, with the adrenaline felt throughout the movie starting to wear a bit thin, but the action is still very well done and consistently fun.Overall, Con Air is a great Nic Cage action flick, providing lots of tension, one liners, and explosions from start to finish.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Excellent actionthriller, but ""The Rock was better.","Con-air can be viewed upon as the sequel to ""The Rock"" because of the following things: 1) it has the same star(N.Cage) and producer(J. Bruckheimer) as ""The Rock"" 2) storywise it can easily be what happened to Nicolas Cage`s character from ""The Rock, after he escaped Alcatraz. Nicolas Cage plays Cameron Poe, a military-officer who kills a man to protect his wife.  Poe is sentenced to 7 years in prison.  7 years later he is going aboard a plane called ""con-air"", which will be taking him back to his wife and daughter. Everything is not running smoothly though, as the other convicts take over the plane. Poe does not want to be a part of the hijacking so he does what he can to prevent the plain from reaching the destination set by the other convicts, and he tries to tell the police where they are heading. The film has plenty of cool actionscenes and two quality actors(Cage and Malcowich).  However, the movie is not as good as ""The Rock"", and the music is lame when compared to ""the Rock`s"" soundtrack. It must still be said that Con-air is a very good movie and one of the best American actionmovies of 1997.  Rent it! 9/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"If it were a comic book,  it would be good","Cameron Poe is a US Amry Ranger who comes back home with the joy of seeing his wife who is pregnant with their baby. Their happiness of finally being together is ruined when in defense of his wife, Poe kills a punk who was threatening her and winds up in prison. Fast forward five or so years and Poe is now ready to fly home. But, pardon the cliché, this is no ordinary flight.Packed with ridiculous and exaggerated, though pretty entertaining, characters this film is ripe comic book material. Almost a dumbed down and much less stylish version of Sin City. It has plenty of TNT action and macho testosterone that you'd expect from an action movie like this. Even some of the performances are decent with a truly unique and interesting mix of weird and down right whacko characters.The problem is that the whole film overall is incredibly stupid, not believable for a second, and predictable all the way through.

THERE'S ONLY 2 PEOPLE I TRUST; ONE'S ME- THE OTHER'S NOT YOU,"For action and entertainment, not too many movies each year deliver.  ""Con Air"" is entertaining, which is one thing I expect a movie to do.  Nick Cage and John Malkovich lead the way with catchy one liners and light-hearted drama.  John Cusack also delivers a solid performance, and there is enough action and little twists to keep me interested for the entire movie.  The dialogue is simple, yet clever throughout.  One scene typifies the movie. Cage's character sees the plane he is on with a sports car accidentally hooked to the plane.  He says rather calmly, ""any other day, that might seem strange...""  The ending is over the top with explosions and mayhem, which detracts a little from the entire movie.  The director definately wanted Malkovich's character dead, and he over killed him.

Simplistic and Infantile,"'Con Air' is an exploration of the untold depths into which an action film can sink when guided solely by a lust for revenues. Nicolas Cage is an exemplary inmate just released and on his way home, who finds himself aboard a prisoner transportation airplane hijacked by a group of notorious convicts. Depressingly one-dimensional and sadistic, the film is a cluttered patchwork of often unrelated action scenes, centered around miserable primordial notions of good (Cage) and evil (everyone else onboard the plane, with the possible exception of a black diabetic inmate). Most viewers over the age of twelve will rapidly lose interest following the introductory procession of stereotypical villainous characters -the latter representing the worst fears of American suburbia, and featuring Latino drug barons, deranged murderers, compulsive rapists, serial killers and, of course, black supremacists. At some random point toward the end, there is a botched attempt to conceal the film's barrenness behind a deranged display of chaotic blasts caused by the airplane's landing in downtown Las Vegas. Yet even this nauseating waste of production funds on a meaningless vision of urban mayhem fails to stir the film's overbearing numbness. Following the crash, the audience is left with a number of bizarre segments offering an unbefitting comical twist to a truly laughable film.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

They somehow managed to get every creep and freak in the universe onto this one plane.,"Con Air...where to start? This film is one of them films you have to watch because its just an excellent action adventure movie. Its very much along the same lines as all the other film which its based around...Die Hard and Lethal Weapon. Its easily in the top list of action films with those two films, but though its the same Con Air offers something different.Con Air is basically the story of Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage)...I know John McClaine and Riggs sound better but just because the main characters name is bad doesn't mean the film is bad...I mean the names can only get better right? Still the film is around him being transported with several other prisoners, the only difference is that hes being set free...so this begs the question why is he with the most wanted guys in America on this plane in the first place? Anyway several minutes into the movie and we meet the other characters but the most important one is the villain Cyrus 'the Virus' (John Malkovich)...I told you the names get better! Anyway because all these prisoners all want to escape and are all as bad as each other they decide to in fact all try to escape! makes sense right? Its at this point we learn that one of the security personnel have in fact done the most stupid of things and taken a gun on board the aircraft (guess who ends up with the gun...YEP...CRYUS).Anyway as the film progresses along we learn that Cameron is trying to get home to see his daughter whom hes never seen and hes got her a present (wont spoil it for you but its quite important and has some good moments in the film). The film is very much like the other two I mentioned, its fast paced and has loads of memorable moments where Cameron tries to stop the prisoners from stopping him seeing his daughter.The most memorable thing about the movie though is the sound track its so good and so suited to the environment. The ending is also a real treat after following the main character you finally see one of the most powerful endings in any action adventure film (it will more than likely make you cry). The other thing which is important about this film is the sound track the main song ""How do I live"" is a very very good track and at the end is used to good effect.This film is by far one of the best Nicolas Cage movies...though he does have several which include Gone in 60 seconds and National Treasure. This film however marks the beginning of his action roles and is one which is easily the best.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Put the bunny back in the box.,"In anticipation of Old Guy (2025) coming out later this month, I have decided to binge through the filmography of Simon West and that journey starts off with Con Air (1997). This movie is one of the most insanely awesome guilty pleasure movies I've watched in my life.Positives for Con Air (1997):
This movie has one of the most insane ensemble cast of actors which includes Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, John Malkovich, Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames, Colm Meane, Mykelti Williamson and Rachel Ticotin. The character of Cameron Poe is one of the best role for Nicholas Cage as he is truly insane in this movie with his performance and his ridiculous southern accent. The other characters are some of the most entertaining batch of characters in the history of cinema. The musical score is amazing and it brings so much life to the movie. The action sequences are so awesome and you get some amazing shootouts and explosions throughout the entire movie. You also have some of the best lines of dialogue I've heard in a 90s action movies.

Flying solo men? Here is a film that will complete any Saturday night being spent alone,"If there is nothing else to do on your wimpy, pathetic, miserable life, then do what most lonely people should do on a Saturday night: check out a mindless action flick. Of course, the trick is, finding an actual good one. The 80s was a decade chock full of them, but the past two decades, we've seen quite a decline on full-powered action movies destined to destroy the plot and still be able to run on fight after gunfight after explosion after unnecessary roughness. The Rundown is an example of an action flick that doesn't allow the plot to conquer the film, and allows for style to conquer substance. The Transporter relies on an extremely simple plot and expands upon it with a long action scene that runs in the second half of the movie. Jerry Bruckheimer knows how to blow things up (a lot of things I may add), and while this isn't always good for Hollywood, which doesn't get many films nowadays that can be attributed to the word ""instant classic"" or ""masterpiece,"" the technique does indeed work for this movie; the mindless yet satisfying Con Air.Con Air has enough action, blood, and guts to make you look away at the screen and wipe off the bloodstains that have suddenly appeared all over your shirt. While being hyper-violent but not a point of losing too much realism, Con Air stands as one of Bruckheimer's best works, director Simon West's best work, and one of the best action movies to come out within the last 15 years. Also, unlike most action movies released in history, this one actually has believable acting, some convincingly tough and creepy convicts, and also doesn't allow the sappy moments to soak in on the running time.Convicts. Plane. Convicts entering plane. Smart convicts. Hero of story is at the wrong place at the wrong time. Convicts take over. Simple enough? Now, add the fact that more convicts have to enter the plane, add the fact that some feds want to shoot the plane down despite the innocent folks boarding, add the one guy about to die if he doesn't take his insulin, add the one female aboard and a rapist ready for his next victim, and then add the psychotic murderer who scares even the toughest aboard. We get conflict after conflict after conflict; it doesn't end. By the time the movie is over, we'll be able to see four to five fights, one massive gun battle, and a dozen action sequences, some ranging from short, to amazingly loooong.Scott Rosenberg does a superb job in giving the characters in the film a lot to do, even with the film clocking in at two hours. Also, he doesn't sap the movie up with too many tear-jerking scenes about Cameron Poe (Nicholas Cage) wanting to see his wife and daughter after 8 years. John Malkovich is excellent as the main villain, as he is violent, unsympathetic, yet portrays himself as trigger-happy, when he is much smarter than the impression he gives others. Ving Rhames does his usual awesome performance as the main villain's second-hand man. Rounding out the supporting cast is Dave Chappelle, Steve Buscemi, Danny Trejo, Mykelti Williamson, M.C. Gainey, and also John Cusack.Con Air takes no prisoners, literally and figuratively. This is a Man's film, and it's not for the easily offended or queasy. This film has it all: good fights, action sequences that stretch beyond the imagination, brutal deaths, amazing gun battles, and then an obsession with pyrotechnics that delivers so many explosions, it almost looks like World War III was going on. The special effects were excellent and was never overused, and rarely did it ever look unrealistic. But for some odd reason, everything flammable that you can possibly think of just happens to show up.With little time to think about what just happened, you are forced to sit there, like some of the victims in the plane, and go along for a wild ride that seemed to have no end. Nonetheless, it's a better ride than you would expect out of an action movie that has more fire than air in almost every frame. Witty dialogue, nice little twists, well-thought out sequences, and a cleverly creepy scene involving the most psychotic killer and the most innocent of children rounds out the 1997 action blockbuster.Bottom Line: Lowlifes, single men, get off your seat, and rent Con Air. You'll forget your troubles; you'll forget everything that's going on, because this movie won't allow you to think. Instead, you'll be practically forced to sit there and witness all the carnage, all the senseless violence, and all the bitter, no-holds-barred action that is sprinkled upon every single set and scenery in the movie. No, that's not a bad thing at all. Despite the fact that mixing action with good acting and great writing happens so seldom it can be considered a modern-day contradiction, Con Air pulls it off nicely. The movie doesn't take long to start, and once it starts, it will continue flying high on bloodshed up until the very end. This is indeed a Man's film. Before Snakes on a Plane, there were convicts on a plane. Difference is, the snakes didn't have motivation, or weapons of mass destruction.

Others like Danny Trego, Colm Meany, M.C Gainey, Rachel Ticotin, Steve Eastin, David Chapelle, Monica Potter, Nick Chinlund, Renoly, Landry Allbright, and Mykelti Williamson were really good. But no other man was as good as Steve Bucsemi. I cut off one girls head and wore it as a hat through 3 states. He is worse than Hanniball Lector.

Con Air,"I have loved this film since the first time I have seen it at least 20 years ago! This is a great action film and nothing more. You can't watch this film with the expectation of anything other then a good action flick.

I admit that it took me 2 sittings to make it through the movie. Nicholas Cage shattered any rumor that he possesses no acting ability by showing the world that he can indeed act as the most unconvincing redneck, hillbilly, moron, Army Ranger idiot that could have ever been thought up for a movie.I found myself drooling and picking my nose, although I did manage to stop short of eating my boogers as the movie reached its climatic ridiculously absurd ending.How it has such a high rating is a mystery to me.

"CON AIR is a big, noisy, pre-fab summer movie. Yes, it delivers large-scale stunts and lots of hyperactive energy; but after six or so climaxes, it is just plain exhausting.","Nicholas Cage is the good-guy hero, Cameron Poe, a Southern soldier jailed for killing another man in a fight. He has paid his debt to society after years of separation from his loving wife and daughter. Poe is on his way home on a flight carrying some of the scum of the earth. The script tells us over and over just how bad these hardened criminals are. How bad are they? ""Every creep and freak in the universe, the worst of the worst."" Led by Cyrus ""the Virus"" (John Malkovich), they take over of the airplane (yea right). Also flying business class with Cyrus are demented sex offenders, crackheads, career rapists, murderers, serial killers, a drag queen and a violent black militant. Oh, yes--there is also an attractive female guard handcuffed in the galley for the rapist to drool over throughout the flight. Unlike that other cons-take-over-an-airplane movie, TURBULENCE, these guys don't crash at LAX, but make a spectacular landing on the strip in Las Vegas. The most satisfying moment has the cargo plane taking out the Vegas Hard Rock Cafe. Maybe they should have circled around and aimed for those Golden Arches. I Loved the flying convertible sequence. Excessive violence, excessive pyrotechnics, excessive music and a script in which every word must have been underlined pound viewers into physical submission. The corny emotional sequences, however, ring completely hollow.Director Simon West, who has graduated from TV commercials, has a quick-cut, music-video sensibility that will grow annoying to those with an attention span longer than five seconds. Oscar-honored Cage adopts a stiff, Alabamy-bound accent, but demonstrates that after THE ROCK and FACE/OFF, he is ready for an action-hero upgrade.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Dark comedy or action thriller?,"Floor wax or dessert topping?Relax, it's both. After watching an excruciating first 30 minutes of the movie anticipating a decent, mindless action flick, I came to realize that the movie makers hadn't intended it to have a believable story line nor three-dimensional characters. Nope. What I got from the movie was so much better: Jerry Bruckheimer was shooting a comedy, carefully wrapped up in a blast-fest package.Once I realized that, my opinion of the movie changed.Like other IMDB contributors, I thought Cage's drawl was silly. I also thought casting Cusack, a great actor, as an unlikely action hero was weak (driving alone to meet a plane full of vicious convicts, armed with only a pistol?). Yes, the plot was filled with more holes than a Beverly Hills golf-course. Yes, the story was predictable and the dialogue unbelievable. Yes, great talent was wasted (Cage, Cusack, Malkovich). But, I have to admit, the movie was good for a few yucks and a lot of adrenaline rush. I also enjoyed Malkovich's performance as an intellectually-advanced, morally-stunted psychopath.Before I realized it was a comedy, I would have given the movie a 2 or 3. But now, armed with this knowledge, I give it a 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

An action-packed thriller!,"Once once in many years is a movie released that appeals to the inner soul of a man, makes him think, makes him see the world in a new perspective, forces him to ponder over the little things in life....This is not one of those movies.This movie defines mind-blowing action, with Nicolas Cage being in the center of it all. First of all, I'd like to say right off that if you want a deep, thought-provoking story, then this is not the movie for you. Con Air works as a stress reliever; filled with explosions, extremely high number of casualties, bombs exploding, planes crashing, karate scenes etc etc.Nicolas Cage plays as a convict being released. He is set to go to Carson City by air, along with many other hi-profile criminals who are being transferred. He has a wife and a daughter waiting him for him, and he is looking forward to a new beautiful life. But then a slight problem comes in the way. The plane he is in is captured by the criminals, the leader of them being John Malkovich. Now it is up to Nicolas Cage to think of something so that he can get off the plane and see his family again. And then the action starts.Nicolas Cage was brilliant in this movie, he played up to his role extremely well; and Malkovich was excellent as the criminal leader who knows what he is doing, and is extremely good doing it.All in all, this is an excellent summer flick that acts more as eye-candy to the stressed soul who wants to see large scale gunfights and planes crashing.

A FLIGHT TO ALABAMA?,"Con-Air is kind of movies that you don't look for a logical script,satisfying character analyzes or lessons for life.You just go and watch the movie.You remember that there were times that movies were just for entertainment.It helps you forget the day and enjoy the moment.And I think Con-Air does it very well,all of the special effects,explosions,gunfights.chases...It's hard to find a minute to breath and focus on another thing. Con-Air is the plane that all 'respected' and 'highly-reputable' criminals of U.S.A. are brought together for a transport.And of course there is a good man who will save the day.The bad guys take the control of the plane so you start to think with all of this cruel gang if there can be a top for the action.The script has a lot of senseless points like if there is any way to put all these men together with such a lazy security or every agent in U.S.A. knows 'cutting the root' with exploding something no matter what the cost is the best solution for a problem.But as I said the action is so successful that if writers tried to write the script deeper,there won't be such a big chance to make this adrenaline crush.Seeing this movie I thought that Simon West would be good action-movie director but I still can't believe that is there any chance to make a 'going down' movie like Tomb Raider.Then I figure it out that the key to this movie is the script;it is too smooth.It has no mysteries,puzzles,dialogs to analyze so it lets the director create huge action scenes.Like Tomb Raider,if you try to tell a story,an adventure,too,Simon West is the wrong man.By choosing him you both loose the chance to tell the story or make great action scenes.Con-Air is a typical Bruckheimer production:good cast,easy story,smooth script,a director who is familiar with action movies,culture of new generation and of course the explodings that are planned never to stop.After The Rock Bruckheimer chose a different path.I think Con-Air and Pirates Of The Caribbean are the best ones of this period.In movies like Pearl Harbor and Armageddon he tried to tell a story,too.But Michael Bay was the wrong man.To achieve this he finally worked with Gore Verbinski and 'right in target!'.Unlike most of his other productions the bad guys are another topic to speak.These guys are not just characters to be.In this movie Malkovich,Rhames,Trejo and of course Buscemi make the villains to watch.All of the action and humor are on the shoulders of these guys.There is no need to speak about the cast very long.There can be great actors but the language of their performance depends on their charisma in this film;except Buscemi.Just for watching Steve Buscemi,this movie is one of the gifted ones.This guy is a great actor and after seeing the movie the longest talk can be about his character.I don't say that this movie is a classic.Probably when there is John Woo,it's hard to remember this one.But in 1970's the Michael Caine movies are the purist tone of action movies.Now time has changed.There are special effects,new concepts and audience approach to action in different ways.And I think Con-Air is one of the examples of the pure action movie of these times.Besides sometimes you love a movie just because it's just a movie",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Cusack, Rhames, Malcovich, and Buscemi in: I Needed the Money!","This is an interesting anomaly in the Hollywood Spectrum. Take an overly talented cast (John Cusack, John Malkovich, Ving Rhames, and Steve Buscemi) and make a movie as bad as possible. I do not blame anyone for this movie. Not the writers, not the director, not even Nicholas Cage. Somehow, this movie managed to suck and I don't know how. Outside of Magnolia and Cradle Will Rock, this is one of the most talented ensembles I've ever seen. Take almost anyone of these men (or even Nick Cage in some movies) and you've got a Being John Malcovich or High Fidelity or Pulp Fiction or Ghost World worthy performance. Put them together, and you get Con Air. Not that there aren't funny moments. Steve Buscemi is especially hilarious as a Hannibal Lecter-esque sociopath. But the battle scenes and climactic chase scene all seem rather forced. Mind you, I didn't watch this expecting Citizen Kane. I watched this expecting cheese along the lines of Plan 9 or Chopping Mall. What I get instead are lazy performances from a talented cast who needed a paycheck. As for Nicholas Cage (I had to get to it sooner or later), his character has NO FLAWS. He should have a freaking halo around his head the entire time. Even during a fight scene he is NEVER to blame for anything. If his long-haired hick of a character had any flaws he might be interesting. But, as the previews showed, even when he's in a life-or-death situation, he's more worried about his daughter's stuffed rabbit then anything else. I give it a four just because I can't completely hate a movie with the combined forces of Malkovich, Cusack, Buscemi, and Rhames. Heck, it even had Dave Chapelle being not funny, which is really hard to imagine for anyone who's seen his stand-up special, Killing Them Softly. With this much talent, you can't completely hate the movie. Until next time, this is ToucanBob fighting the good fight.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

The film is full of cliche, which is not always a bad thing, and leads you nicely on to the obvious end.The film centres on Cameron Poe an 'innocent' murderer and ex-soldier.  Now being released he finds himself on an aircraft hi-jacked by the worst criminals in America, nicknamed 'Con Air'.  The inevitable happens, of course.John Malkovich, John Cusack, plus many others, are excellent actors, and steal the show.  They, unfortunately, make Nicholas Cage look wooden, and encourage support for the 'baddies'.Worse, still, the script tries too hard to involve 'comedy' ala Die Hard. Whilst the 'running gag' does tie the film together a bit, it is really quite risible.  The script also is hampered by Political Correctness, and some of it's assertions on rape are just laughable.  In short, don't think about the film too much, it'll turn you off it",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Disappointing. Falls foul of the Celine Dion Factor,"Disappointing to me, as I am a big fan of some of its closest relatives within the burgeoning action film canon (The Rock, Face Off, Bad Boys, Die Hard with a Vengeance in particular). What distinguishes these films, is that they have a certain style about them: you can look at any number of scenes or shots within them and think 'that's cool'. You cannot do this with Con Air. There are no shots to match those of the Bridge or Alcatraz Island in The Rock for aesthetic and photographic quality; it lacks the choreographed, balletic style of Face-Off and the orchestrated precision of, say, the break-in in Die Hard.. ; and compared to its sibling chase scenes in The Rock and Bad Boys, Con Air's final reel is less a scintillating, grippingly visceral rollercoaster and more a sprawling, unravelling mess. Symptomatic of the film's stylistic failure (and all of these films, with the exception of Face Off, can only be exercises in style) is its (mis)use of music. Whereas Die Hard with.. and Face Off used music at times to remarkable effect, Con Air simply adds Celine Dion in a crass and reprehensible attempt to intensify its romantic scenes. No film worth anything would ever feature Celine Dion in its soundtrack, and no action movie can ever neglect the effect of its soundtrack and retain the sense of style upon which films in the genre must be judged.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

Although it does contain some competent special effects and a few shining moments at the hands of John Malcovich, John Cusak, and Steve Buscemi, these brief temptations of satisfaction only make the viewer wonder why these outstanding actors chose to participate in such a foul heap of Hollywood dung.

Cy..Anorra!!,"'Con Air' represents everything wrong with the action film genre. Granted, I loved the Die Hards and some of Arnold's work, but this film is just way too much in terms of ridiculous logic and loud bang-bangs. The plot involves a too-good-to-be-true wrongly accused prisoner (of course he has no true flaws) played by Nicholas Cage, on his way home after being released. He can't wait to see his wife and daughter, but one problem: he is put on a plane with a group of the most dangerous criminals in the country, including John Malkovich as Cyrus 'the Virus' who have plans of their own. (old John was clearly collecting a good pay check here to pay off that mansion.) Others in the gang include Ving Rhames, Steve Buscemi, and Danny Trejo. You might say this is an impressive cast in an opressive story. Even more absurd is Cage's southern accent that makes Dennis Quaid's Any Given Sunday accent look as authentic as a NASCAR driver's. This movie is non-stop catch phrases and explosions, the kind of thing that pays John Woo's bills and makes a ton at the box office. I'm all in favor of selling out every once in a while. Hell, like the Tupac song says ""Hey, I gotta get paid.""... But 'Con Air' is on a level of it's own. It's dumb, real dumb. Mind-numbing dumbness. If you make it through the film, you're in a for a real treat of an ending. This is laughable: Cage gets to see his family (CUE THE SAPPY POP-LOVE MUSIC!!). You're sitting there thinking this can't be not a parody, but it's true...and I don't get why they make Steve Buscemi's character, the sickest of all the criminals get away at the end!!

Junk-food cinema for the Nintendo generation.,"There are two kinds of action flicks as far as I'm concerned  the elaborate, well-thought out vehicles that suck the viewer in with good characterization and worthwhile plots (stuff like ""Die Hard,"" ""The Fugitive"" and ""True Lies"" to name a few recent cinematic highlights in this genre), and the ones that rely on explosions, relentless fight scenes, big budgets and plenty o' effects (""Eraser,"" ""Die Hard II,"" ""Rambo,"" and any number of action sequels).  ""Con Air"" is wedged somewhere between the two, though closer to ""Die Hard II"" -- you sorta care about a few of the characters, but not enough to stand up and root for them unabashed.  Still, it doesn't really matter, because by the final lap Jerry Bruckheimer has reduced the film to action-mockery and Explosions R Us (the same fate ""The Fifith Element"" suffered).Bruckheimer, with his late partner Don Simpson, engineered flicks like ""Beverly Hills Cop,"" ""Top Gun,"" ""Days of Thunder"" and ""The Rock""  ""Con Air"" is more of the same; a film that feels more like an arcade-game than a work of art.  It's junk-food cinema for the Nintendo generation.The star of the show, Nicolas Cage's ex-Army Ranger Cameron Poe, is finally getting out of lock-up after eight years to see his family; imprisoned for defending his pregnant wife in a bar fight and killing a hooligan (personally, froma legal standpoint, I don't see how he could have gotten sent up river, but hey, this is Hollywood).  So, for God-knows-what-reason, he's sent aboard a C-123K plane in the Air Transport division of the U.S. Marshal's Service, a carrier that transporting some of the nation's most dangerous felons across the country to a new super-maximum security facility.  But guess what -- Poe suddenly finds himself mixed up in a carefully detailed skyjacking masterminded by Cyrus ""The Virus"" Grissom (played unequivocally by Malkovich).  And, as you might guess, Poe becomes a reluctant hero, fighting to thwart Cyrus and his band of ""lifers"" from massacring everyone on board as the damaged plane careens toward disaster on the famed Las Vegas strip. The criminal superstars are probably the best part of the film: there's Malkovich (awesome in every role he's played), black militant Nathan `Diamond Dog' Jones (Ving Rhames), Johnny 23 (Danny Trejo) and Garland Greene (Steve Buscemi), a serial killer who arrives on board encased in custom-made restraints patterned after Hannibal Lecter's in ""The Silence of the Lambs.""The film's most riveting scene comes when Buscemi, the soft-spoken serial-killer, has tea with a little girl who's likely to become his next victim  the little girl and he instead sing `He's Got the Whole World In His Hands.'  Other than that, and a few other scenes, the movie is basically a procession of swift set-ups, oddball characters, spiked colloquy and action sequences.

Nicolas Cage can not be bettered,"In the last few years, Cage has proven his ability to act the action hero. Playing the main guy in The Rock and playing opposite John Travolta in Face/off, he has managed to bring more to an action film. In this film, he plays released con Cameron Poe who is aboard a prison plane taken over by killer Cirus Grisham(john malkovich). Cage does his best to be noticed but frankly, Malkovich wins hands down! Excellent support by Monica Potter(patch adams) John Cusack(money for nothing) Ving Rhames(out of sight) Dave Chappelle(woo) Danny Trejo(heat) and Steve Buscemi(fargo).

Malkovich and Buscemi are worth watching it,"This is typical fare from the Jerry Bruckheimer machine, which cranked out such razzberry-worthy mega-blockbusters as THE ROCK, ARMAGEDDON (my money back???), GONE IN 60 SECONDS, etc.Nic Cage (whose SUTHIN' ACCENT needs a ton of practice) plays Cameron Poe, a parolee from Mobile, AL, who after serving an 8 year sentence for manslaughter, is finally going to meet his little girl and reunite with the wife. The plane he is boarding to go home in is about to be taken over by a bunch of career criminals like Diamond Dog (Ving Rhames), Cyrus Grissom (John Malkovich) and Pin-Ball (Dave Chapelle), who are planning to pick up a Columbian Drug Lord at Carson City, and fly off to a non-treatied country.Malkovich is always a gleefully naughty villain. Chapelle is a good comic relief, although the whole movie really is a comic crime adventure. Mykelti Williamson as Poe's pal Baby-O is a good support. M.C. Gainey as Swamp Thing, the wacky con who pilots the fugitive plane is a hoot--- just the wacky insane look in his eyes will bust your guts!!! Steve Buscemi as the Marrietta Mangler a.k.a. Garland Greene, is right where he goes best, as a psycho who says a lot of things that disturbingly make sense!!!Colm Meaney and John Cusack play federal agents who oppose each other's tactics as much as they oppose the actions of the convicts.Not the greatest action/adventure of all time, but worth a few laughs.",,Anonymous,Crime

"OK, just OK","I've heard numerous people saying that Con-Air is their favourite film of all time. Hearing this time after time, i finally decided to watch it when broadcast on the box.I was expecting the same quality of other classics action films from the 90s like die hard. Sadly however, this doesn't even stand close of it in terms of overall viewing.Nicholas Cage, for all the things i love him for, was at times, annoying. I'm not one to judge the accent but either ways, truly annoying . The concept was brilliant and there were some great characters, mainly the convicts. I most interested in watching these baddies killing and blowing stuff up than watching Cage trying to make it out alive to see his wife and daughter again.The shootout at the deserted airfield deserves merits and the final showdown between Cage and Cyrus was great. The ending on the otherhand, best not to go there but totally understandable with the song choice seeing that this was made in the 90s.There are some riveting moments ( and some darker moments ) that makes con air enjoyable. My expectations were perhaps set up to high. good to watch on Saturday night.",,Anonymous,Crime
Brainless entertainment - and I like it!,"Con Air is the perfect film to watch with a bunch of friends on a Saturday night - no plot (that makes sence), no developement, just lots of explosions and tons of action.  Nicholas Cage is laughable in his performance of a Southern Ranger, but who cares, it adds to the cheesiness of the film, along with the classic oneliners.  The ending is a bit over the top, even for an action movie, but it detracts little from this classic action flick.  Con Air is full of great characters (even thought they are quite two dimensional and stereotypical, but again, action flick) to add to the action, from a philosophical serial killer to the d*ckwad DEA agent.  As said before, check your brain at the door, and simply come to Con Air expecting a wild crazy flight to the deadly end!",,Anonymous,Crime

Could have been so much more.,"I really wanted to like this film.  The basic premise of the plot was great and it had a fantastic cast.  But all this seems to have gone to waste. Nicholas Cage's abilities were wasted by a poor script, and let's not go into the accent.  John Cussack also seemed very much out of place, and I felt his character added very little to the story. Okay, it was an action film, but there's no reason why the rather intelligent plot basis couldn't have been expanded into a wholly intelligent film.  Sadly it was riddled with poor jokes, ridiculous sub-plots, and a lot of unnecessary characters and events.I must however commend John Malkovich for playing a convincing and genuinely menacing psychopath, and for the best part of the film, Steve Buscemi's talents had not gone to waste, even if his character was a little superfluous to the plot.  But that final scene...way to really screw up an average movie.""Well, he *is* a psychopath and he did kill 30 people, but come on!

Enjoy the thrill ride,"Strap yourselves into your seat, fasten your seatbelts and prepare for one of the most exhilarating thrill rides as ""Con Air"" takes you on a two-hour adventure that includes an all-star cast, powerful action sequences and great direction. Everyone will be glad to learn that ""Con Air"" is an action film that is able to have a great story to accompany it.Originality and believability are two more keys to the success of a film because if nobody believes the story, success can be thrown out the window. ""Con Air"" revolves around a plane carrying high-risk prisoners being transported to a maximum-security prison. However, the prisoners have other ideas.Action films cannot survive without the right cast in place to portray the heroes and villains; therefore, the director must locate the right talent who has the correct chemistry to make it work. For ""Con Air,"" the director chose five immensely and incredibly talented actors who fit this formula. Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, John Malkovich, Ving Rhames lead an all-star, stellar cast in ""Con Air."" Chemistry between cast members is key to the success of every movie. It didn't take long to realize these five actors contained a massive amount of chemistry.Cage stars as Cameron Poe, a parolee on his way home to his wife and daughter until he runs into a problem and save the day. Cage is one of the most versatile actors I have come across. Playing everything from a romantic lead in ""It Could Happen To You"" and Moonstruck"" to dramatic roles in ""Leaving Las Vegas"" and ""Bringing Out The Dead"" to comedic roles in ""Trapped In Paradise"" and ""Guarding Tess."" He is the ultimate action star combining all of these elements to bring home the role of Cameron Poe. For this reason, I'm proud to call him one of my favorite actors.Monica Potter and young newcomer Landry Albright star as Cameron's wife and daughter to whom he is flying home to after being paroled. Potter's beauty radiates off the screen with such heat and force I almost melt. She may not be a veteran, but Potter's poise, beauty, talent and presence has proven that she could be mistaken for one. I relish every opportunity I had to watch her on screen because I knew what I was seeing was something special. Potter is on the rise with awards in her future and great films on the horizon.Albright's performance as Casey brought smiles to my face because she is one of the cutest and most talented newcomers to hit Hollywood in recent years. Albright may not have a lot of dialogue, but her presence on screen is a sight for sore eyes, her beauty is hypnotizing and her energy is electric. Albright will have a long, bright future in acting if she decides to pursue the profession because she has the special sparkle in her eye and aura surrounding her. I can't wait to see her next film.Malkovich is Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom, the ringleader of the hijacking. Malkovich's face oozes with villainous intent, which is one of the reasons he is so great at playing one. With his role in ""Con Air,"" he proves once again he is the best. Cyrus was calm, cool, and collected in the face of danger as he led his group of convicts. With his role as Cyrus, I have gained a new respect for Malkovich because I was able to see the true range and versatility he brought to the role.However, the best was yet to come as I learned that the supporting cast was a welcome surprise. For example, Rhames is Nathan 'Diamond Dog' Jones, Cyrus' right hand man. Mykelti Williamson stars as Baby-O O'Dell, Poe's only friend on board ""The Jailbird."" John Cusack is Vince Larkin, a federal agent, who from the ground is doing his best to bring down the plane full of convicts. At odds with Larkin is Duncan Malloy, played by Colm Meaney.Another aspect of ""Con Air"" I enjoyed was the writing because the film was able to tell a story with substance without letting the action take over. Creating great character development and story depth are just a few examples how the writers were able to win me over.The special effects in ""Con Air"" is great that it made me feel as if were part of that flight right along with the convicts. I commend director Simon West, and producer Jerry Bruckheimer on how well they put together the action sequences and bringing together the tremendous cast without any clash of egos.Finally, the one thing that signed, sealed, and delivered this movie was the signature song performed by Trisha Yearwood called ""How Do I Live."" It remains my favorite song even today, five years after ""Con Air"" was released.This is an action packed film from start to finish that has a believable plot; as well as comedic moments at times with great one-liners by various actors. I urge everyone to see ""Con Air"" for a great action film with substance.",,Anonymous,Crime

"Really, really stupid but somehow...","I don't know. I saw this in the theater, I hated it then. I saw it on cable, I hated it then also. On the way to a ski lodge, it was playing on the bus ride.

A bunch of convicts take over the plane they're being taken to some prison in and all sorts of mayhem ensues. Maybe it's because it doesn't take itself too seriously and all the actors involved seem to be enjoying themselves, that it doesn't fail completely. It has enough action for at like fifteen movies and there's a point in the movie that it just doesn't let up for like a straight hour. It's got a pretty good cast and never gets boring. I think Nicolas Cage was wrong for the role. I'm surprised to see he even did this. I don't picture him as a buff action hero but he manages to be as convincing as you can be, given the character he plays. You have all sorts of villains with colorful names like Cyrus the Virus, Billy Bedlam and Sally Cant Dance (I'm not a homophobe but that character just gives me the willies).

Good action movies that at least has three things going for it...,"Yes, if there are only three positive things about this film they'd be:1) The Action: This being a Jerry Bruckheimer action movie, you can count on that.  From the scene where the prisoners escape there bonds to the ending motorcycle/fire truck chase, the action amazes to say the least.2) The Villain: John Malkovich is always able to play a good psycho, but his ""Cyrus the Virus"" is my personal favorite.  Cyrus kills without thinking twice and takes pleasure in infuriating the DEA officers after the captured plane.3) Steve Buscemi Veteran character actor Buscemi plays Hannibal Lecter-type convict Garland ""The Marrietta Mangler"" Greene.  Greene spews philosiphy and provides bizarre comic relief as action hero Nicolas Cage fumbles his fake Southern accent over and over again.Aside from Malkovich and Buscemi, the acting in Con Air isn't exactly perfect, but hey, it's an action movie.Okay action, 7/10.",,Anonymous,Crime
Your IQ must be this low to watch this movie...,"What a hideous movie.  At numerous points, I felt like the movie was contrived and at others, I felt like the movie writers were making obvious and shameful attempts to grab the viewers' emotions.Like with Buscemi's character - he goes off to one side, finds a child in the middle of nowhere.  The director alludes to the fact that he maligns and destroys the girl, and then later, reveals that nothing apparently happened. What am I, a voodoo doll for the director's pleasure?And the reason for Cage's character to remain on the plane (and in the story line) felt like it was decided on by committee and sewn in with big stitches.  He has to save his diabetic black friend and hispanic lady officer.  How much more PC could it have gotten?  I guess they could have made the guard pregnant and the friend a father of octuplets...I guess my final complaint would be Malkovich's character's gruesome end - he gets his head flattened by some pile-driver machinery.  Where did that come from?  I was stunned and could only imagine another committee-decided plot-point here: ""We got 3 votes for impalement on a picket fence, 4 for death by country music, and a whopping 7 for the pile-driver.""  This is exactly the kind of tripe that Itchy and Scratchy was made to parody.I think that if a movie has big bucks to spend on big actors, big bucks should likewise be spent on good writers and editors who know how to put spit and polish on the movie to make it look good.  If you haven't already seen this, why don't you give it a pass and watch a classic action flick, like Die Hard or Predator.",,Anonymous,Crime
Thrills! Spills! And some great lines.,"The pitch must have been so simple: ""There's this plane, right. And it's a prison plane going to a maximum security penitentiary, right. And you've got all the most evil, insane, screwed up criminals on it, right. And they hi-jack the plane in mid-air! But, there's one wrongly convicted, ex-ranger on board who's being released and is just on the plane to get a ride home to his wife and daughter, who he's never actually seen. So, he has to beat all the crim's, warn the authorities, get control of the plane, and get back to his family."" Oh, brother. Did I mention Jerry Bruckheimer is producing this one?There are absolutely no prizes for guessing who wins, who loses and who gets the particularly queazy death scene. The outcome is signposted before you even enter the theatre, let alone five minutes in. But be fair, what did you expect? This is gourmet popcorn of the highest order. It rises above lower event films like ID4 and Batman & Robin simply because it has no intention of being anything more than what it is: two hours of violent, funny and very good looking eye candy.Cage and Cusack do what you expect. They're dudley-do-right's that wouldn't return a library book late. But both of them have their harder sides. Cage is sent to prison for man-slaughter during the credits. BUT HE WAS ONLY ACTING IN SELF-DEFENSE AND TO PROTECT HIS FIANCE. Which is pretty much what he does throughout the entire film. Whenever Cage does anything it's either to protect himself or some other helpless person, be they a shackled female prison guard or his prisoner best friend with diabetes. Cage is a great actor but here he's obviously in Bruce Willis sweaty vest mode and plays it to the hilt. Cusack retains a little more dignity but gets less airtime as a result. It's still good to see him in something a little more high-profile than his usual choice but he's obviously just doing it for the self-advertising (it worked).But the show stealers are the villains. Being a nice guy is okay but it's better to a really cool bad guy instead. This films full of them. Malkovich and Rhames lead the nasties and Malkovich does his In The Line Of Fire routine with more energy than you could believe. Rhames gets to be Marcellus Wallace again. He's happy. The rest are a bunch of straight-to-video faves with stupid names like 'Bedlam' Billy and Johnny 23 but they're evil, sick and marvellously cool. Buscemi cameos with his gibbering Lecter-a-like and almost steals the show from Malkovich. He fails of course. Nobody steals the limelight like John Malkovich.He's given free reign to do so with a script which has more one liners than plot exposition. Some of them are dumb. Some of them hit the mark. Most of them do the latter by being the former. She the Quotes section for the good ones but Buscemi's definition of irony really stands out: ""A bunch of idiots on a plane singing a song made famous by a band that died in a planecrash."" It's with the script that this film will lose or gain it's audience. Half of you will just roll with it and enjoy the stupidity (such as threats like ""put the bunny back in the box"") while the rest will just wave it off as utter trash. When the script gives way to the action sequences they suceed due to Simon Wests zippy direction. Like a combination of Woo, Scott and Cameron he slo-mos, explodes or machine guns most of the cast and set. Again you'll either enjoy or get bored.I enjoyed it as the big budget explosion that it obviously was. But I must warn you that this is not the best action film out there. The Rock and Die Hard beat it by miles because sometimes the gags do fall flat, sometimes the cast get a little too hammy and sometimes the ""Oh, pah-lease!' moments get a little too much. The saccharine, sugar-coated beginning and end are a little annoying as well but the ninety-minutes in between make up for that. Better at the cinema than the video but if you need action, excitement and a good laugh then here's the very thing. Buckle up!",,Anonymous,Crime

Steve Buscemi, we could've done without. I like him when he's funny and making people laugh. He's better at doing comedy. Dave Chappelle gave a short comical role and everyone else was pretty much mediocre. But the best performance was that of John Malkovich. He is so good at playing the bad guy. Although it does kinda get old seeing him as the bad guy in just about every movie he's in but he is a very talented actor. He was vicious in this movie! His character (Cyrus the Virus) made me cringe sometimes and he was just downright mean! But he did have some comical lines though. ""Make a move and the bunny gets it!""  I think this movie would've fell flat if he hadn't been cast. The only thing that made me wonder was, why did Cyrus and the other prisoners take the plane hostage? What was their motive? They probably explained it in the movie but I must've missed it. I just didn't understand that part. The scene at the end where Cameron Poe (Cage) meets his daughter for the first time and they start playing the song was sweet and I almost started crying. He was so happy to see his family.

And the judge tells him he is held to a different legal standard because he was an Army Ranger?  Wrong!!!  Couldn't the producers invest in a legal consultation?And why were all the syringes on the airplane broken?  They've been made from plastic since, oh, probably the 1950s!No air traffic controller will mistake a slow-moving sightseeing plane for a much faster aircraft no matter what the transponder indicates.   And what about the passive radar that detects aircraft that don't have transponders?  Was it all turned off that fateful day?Well, they exploded a lot of stuff and killed a bunch of people-- and Malkovich delivered his usual excellent performance.  But hey, don't we viewers deserve at least a  credible storyline?  Fasten your seatbelt lest you fall through the holes in this movie's plot.",,Anonymous,Crime
"It's never a dull moment, but it isn't anything else either","ok. I REALLY HATE TO ADMIT IT but I actually liked this movie.It wasn't boring, and, sure it had no brain but an actionmovie CAN actually get away at some points with only entertainment, but it has got to be a movie like CON AIRCON AIR=stupid, silly but FUN TO WATCH (better than THE MATRIX) 7/10",,Anonymous,Crime
"action, action, and more action","I thought this was a real good movie. It had great special effects, great acting, and a cool plot. This movie has a lot of action. A group of cons have taken over a plane that transfers them to different prisons. But Poe is riding on the plane to  hitch a ride home from being in prison for eight years to see his wife and little girl. So it is up to him to bring the plane down. 8/10. A must see!!!!",,Anonymous,Crime
A decent one time watch of an action movie,Con- Air is a decent big budget film starring everyone from Nicholas Cage to John Malkovich and John Cusack. The synopsis is basic: A ranger tows aboard a transport plane full of convicts led by John Malkovich. They soon take over the plane and all hell ensues. This was a decent film and Malkovich is really good playing against type but seeing this film now where 100 million dollar pyrotechnique are common in every other film Con Air lacks the punch.,,Anonymous,Crime
hold the fake accent,"What a stupid movie this was. Nicolas Cage acted like a real idiot in this one. It seemed like he was daydreaming throughout the entire film. He had no personality, and he never seemed to react to anything that was going on. And his accent sounded so stupid. Even if I didn't know it was a fake accent, I'd still think he sounds stupid. Also, Nicolas Cage seem to be invincable. There were so many times he should have been killed. But, everyone knows that the star of the movie never dies. ""Glory"" was an exception because it was a true story. Also, the story was pointless and the jokes were not funny. I give this film a 7 out of 10.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Good Action, But Thank God for the Bad Guys","Con Air has all the makings of a good, but not great, action movie. It all begins with Nicolas Cage, having just finished his eight-year prison sentence, taking a plane flight home to his wife and daughter. The plane is affectionately known as the ""Jailbird"", and for good reason, as it's filled with the country's most vicious convicts who are being transported across the country to a maximum-security prison. With ""Cyrus the Virus"" (John Malkovich) engineering the break-out, the rowdy criminals quickly take over the plane and predictable carnage ensues. For the most part, Con Air delivers just what you expect: a really straight-forward plot line, lots of action in the form of explosions and gunfire, and a little comedy mixed in among the mayhem. However, Cage, is really weak in his role as ""all-American good guy"" Cameron Poe, whose prison sentence was the result of him simply being at the wrong place at the wrong time. In short, Poe is equivalent to Bruce Willis' John McClane and Sylvester Stalone's Rambo, without any hint of personality. One of the aspects that made Die Hard's McClane so popular is that you got the feeling he was getting a great deal of enjoyment out of kicking some bad guy's ass. The same cannot be said for Poe, who is likable, but has no real distinguishing characteristic or edge that makes him memorable. Jon Cusack is also lame as U.S. Marshall Vince Larkin, another consummate, yet lifeless, ""good guy."" Colm Meaney, although over the top, at least provides some enthusiasm as a fiery and opinionated DEA agent. Thankfully, the bad guys in Con Air are just as impressive as the good guys are unmemorable. The convicts aboard the plane are for the most part unique and combine effective humor with their evil. Unlike the movie's heroes, they actually have personalities. The colorful cast of convicts, also including Steve Buschemi and even Dave Chappelle, makes Con Air worth watching. Nothing about Con Air is especially amazing, but its bad guys and quick pacing make it an enjoyable, prototypical, action flick to kick back to on a long summer night.Rating: 2.5 stars out of 4",,Anonymous,Crime
One of the Best Comedies of 1997!!!,"This has got to be Nicolas Cage's funniest film! A laugh riot from beginning to end, ""Con Air"" has everything a funny movie should have: a ridiculous plot, cartoonish characters, silly dialogue, and unbelievable situations!Cage's ""Southern accent"" is a hoot and his performance as a slow-talking sleepy-eyed soldier wrongfully imprisoned is hysterical! John Malkovich and Steve Buscemi try to outdo each other imitating Anthony Hopkins and Christopher Walken. Watch this one on DVD if you want non-stop laughs (yes, there's a few dramatic parts, but those are easy to spot because of the slow motion)!Jerry Bruckheimer knows how to make a funny film - this one easily tops his other comedies ""The Rock"" and ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" !!",,Anonymous,Crime
A Mindless Adrenaline Rush of a Movie! ***1/2 out of 5,"It's interesting because I don't think I've ever seen a film where literally from beginning to end it's as non-stop and as fast paced as this one. Sure, there's plenty of movies that don't seem to let up, but this one in particular seems extremely anxious to get to the next big scene. It's almost in a rush at the beginning as to say 'Let's hurry up with how Nicholas Cage got into prison' and get on with the fun stuff.And for this film it really works. The action here is INSANE. This is popcorn entertainment at it's best. There's planes, explosions, special effects, and all the razzle dazzle we've come to expect from a Bruckheimer film.The cast itself is a real solid one. We have Nicholas Cage who's always a likable guy. John Malkovich who plays a really great lead villain and has some of the films best lines. Steve Buscemi who hands down is one of the coolest guys in all of Hollywood.It also features a rousing score by Marc Mancina and Trevor Rabin. Always has the action packed, heroic, Bruckheimer feel to it.Great stuff.",,Anonymous,Crime
Its Die Hard meets The Fugitive,Nicholas Cage is good as Cameron Poe. He buffed up for the role.  But its the scene stealing John Malkovich has Cyrus the Virus pretty much takes the picture. His role as a crazy but smart prisoner is well performed. John Cusack is also good as Vince Larkin the nice but know-it-all D.E.A. The action almost never stops. The rest of the cast do well. This is an action classic.,,Anonymous,Crime
Getaway Plane,"Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) steps on the transfer plane after being released from prison.  He is on his way to see his wife and daughter.  He does not realize that this flight will take longer then expected.  After take off, the other prisoners seize control of the plane and are on their way to a great escape.  Poe, who is a free man, has no reason to escape. He also has to help a friend on the plane who needs his insulin or will die. He is left with the decision to help U.S. Marshall Vince Larkin (John Cusack) stop the prisoners and to help his friend who is dying. Con Air was directed by Simon West in 1997.  He also directed such popular films as Laura Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and The General's Daughter (1999). In Con Air, West combines action with comedy.  The film will be serious, and then out of nowhere a punch line will be thrown in for comedy.  In this movie, the director tries to demonstrate that although someone may have a bad past that does not represent who he or she is.  West shows this when Poe, an ex con, helps a friend who is sick and tries to stop other prisoners from escaping, when he does not have to. I feel the film is action packed and contains a little bit of everything. I like how most of the movie takes place on the plane.  The only part that I did not find appealing was the ending because it seem far fetch and not possible at all.",,Anonymous,Crime
High Octane/High Nitrous Oxide,"I must admit to liking this film. The action is indeed in good supply with a liberal sprinkling of humour for good measure.Our main character Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) is being released and shares his final journey to freedom on a flight transporting Lifers and Murderers to a new facility. Of course things don't go as planned.Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom (John Malkovich) is the archetypal Genius bad-boy with little regard for Aviation Safety. The enigmatic character of Garland 'The Marietta Mangler' Greene (Steve Buscemi) appears to be a Murderer's Murderer, trussed-up like Hannibal Lektor's evil brother!However, things are not all they seem.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Fast, Fun, and Funny","This is one of those movies that if your not looking for a 2 hour lecture, then this is the movie for you. Nicholas cage is the perfect redneck, even though i'm from Alabama and I hate how they always make fun of this state. He has the accent down right. The action is great. The story is great and this movie was great.",,Anonymous,Crime
Bruckheimer the enslaver,"As if my summary didn't say enough.  This movie is about as exploitive and stupid as a summer action movie can get.  By using mult-ethnicity, the makers only reveal their own bigotry.  Let's see:We have the black revolutionary complete with dogma and his own 'gangsta style'.  There is the tamer counterpart to balance out any negative effects the former may have, of course.We have the hispanic rapist, sure to be popular with the kids.We have the everyday white serial killers and mass-murders complete with degrees in insanity and lunacy.And, to make things worse, we have Nicolas Cage wasted on a repeat of his role in Raising Arizona.  Whoever thought giving him a southern accent was a bright idea needs to be dropped from 20,000 feet onto a parked Volvo.  John Malkovich, wasted on a role as the dominant predator, shows he is as empty-headed as the script.  He was better in Empire of the Sun.Obviously, a movie of this nature devotes more time and money into making sure the pyrotechnicians don't accidentally kill everyone than the script. If you are a fan of Bruckheimer's work, or if you liked Tomb Raider, then this is for you.  Otherwise, forget it.  The boneyard battle shows--in full glory--where the money went more than any other scene.Overall, so dense you need a chainsaw to get through it, this is predictable entertainment. 1.5 out of 5 stars.  There is better quality stuff out there.",,Anonymous,Crime
Malcovich...one cheesy movie is enough. Now get serious again!,"Well, I would´ve taken the big sack of cash, too. I shouldn´t really criticize Malcovich for acting in a not-credible, macho-man, no-brain, movie like ""CON AIR"", but I wonder how dangerous for the career of a drama actor this action clips are.Hollywood is getting smart. They used to produce this kind of action packed films using no names. Now, aware of the increasing boredom they were creating in most adults, the industry has decided to start plugging in serious, established, quality stars in their cheesy movies (like Glenn Close in ""Air Force One"" or William DaFoe in ""Speed 2"").Don´t get me wrong, ""CON AIR"" was entertaining, of course, but it´s far from being a brain teaser like all the other movies where Malcovich starred in. Again, I would also take the money. Can´t blame him for doing it, but... still...don´t make it a habit, please! Take it as a cameo role and go back to the real projects where people still talk about you a week later.",,Anonymous,Crime
Good action fun,"I bought this movie last year and was glad that I had. Its a funny movie, full of action. The characters range from cruel to insane. Steve Buscemi's character, Garland Green is especially funny(i guess Steve Buscemi is funny in whatever movie he's in) and his lines throughout the movie are SOOO funny. Overall this movie is fast, furious and full of action. Just don't watch this movie for the plot(not much there) instead just sit back and enjoy the wild ride this movie is. 7/10",,Anonymous,Crime
"Stupid, stupid, stupid. But quite fun.","This is one seriously stupid film, but what makes Con Air acceptable is that knows that it is ridiculous and enjoys the ride regardless. I found Nic Cage to be a rather faceless and uninventive hero, but John Malkovich was a good villain. Depending what mood you're in, this can be very annoying or very entertaining. The music is unbelievably corny, especially that silly guitar section that accompanies the big action sequences, and when it appears to be trying to be serious, like at the start, Con Air is quite bad, but in its more bombastic moments, the film becomes near-irresistible. The highlight of all this silliness is the ending, in which the action is so overblown as to become hilarious. If only what preceeded this craziness was just as over the top, then Con Air could have been one of the all time great guilty pleasures. Instead, its just a good laugh.",,Anonymous,Crime
Hello Boys!,"Well, you can't swing a dead cat in this film without walloping a cute guy looking a little sweaty: Cage, Rhames, Malkovich, Cusack, Treja and Chinlund.
