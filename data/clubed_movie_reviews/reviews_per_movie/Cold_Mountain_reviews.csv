A chilling vision of a tragic era,"'War movie' is a Hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clichéd dialogue, rehashed plot and over-the-top action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with large-scale combat. Once in a while, however, a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen. The Civil War-era ""Cold Mountain,"" starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renée Zellweger is such a film.Then again, calling Cold Mountain"" a war movie is not entirely accurate. True enough, the film opens with a (quite literally) quick-and-dirty battle sequence that puts ""Glory"" director Edward Zwick shame. However, ""Cold Mountain"" is not so much about the Civil War itself as it is about the period and the people of the times. The story centers around disgruntled Confederate soldier Inman, played by Jude Law, who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of Cold Mountain, North Carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind, Ada Monroe, played by Nicole Kidman. At first glance, this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier's tribulations on the battlefield. Indeed, the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived.""Cold Mountain"" soon takes a drastic turn, though, as the intrepid hero Inman turns out to be a deserter (incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the Confederates) and begins a long odyssey homeward. Meanwhile, back at the farm, Ada's cultured ways prove of little use in the fields; soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast. Coming to Ada's rescue is the course, tough-as-nails Ruby Thewes, played by Renée Zellweger, who helps Ada put the farm back together and, perhaps more importantly, cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon Ada.Within these two settings, a vivid, compelling and, at times, very disturbing portrait of the war-torn South unfolds. The characters with whom Inman and Ada interact are surprisingly complex, enhanced by wonderful performances of Brendan Gleeson as Ruby's deadbeat father, Ray Winstone as an unrepentant southern ""lawman,"" and Natalie Portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother. All have been greatly affected and changed by ""the war of Northern aggression,"" mostly for the worse. The dark, pervading anti-war message, accented by an effective, haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of Virginia and North Carolina, is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought. Though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century, it's hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant.Director Anthony Minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film, but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters. The love story between Inman and Ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film, though the inherently distant, abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot.Make no mistake, ""Cold Mountain"" has neither the traits of a feel-good romance nor an inspiring war drama. It is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Sensitive film with  great interpretations and spectacular outdoors,"The movie deals about American Civil War (1861-1865) , the starring (Jude Law , though Matt Damon, Josh Hartnett, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Eric Bana were all considered for this role) meets Ada (Nicole Kidman , though Julia Roberts and Cate Blanchett were both considered) in ¨Cold mountain¨ and they fall in love . Then he's enlisted and participates in Battle of Saint Petesburg (Virginia 1864). He leaves and sets off to find his lover . Being dead her father (Donald Sutherland), Nicole will have to confront a lot of misfortunes until that she's helped by a valiant woman (Renee Zellweger) .The picture is overlong , runtime is approx. three hours but is neither boring , nor tiring , but entertaining for the reason that happen several events . The film blends epic battles, drama , a love story, shootouts and a little bit of violence . The motion picture is pretty strong with crude scenes : the bloody battles ,rampages , rape , murders...it has many violent shots , for that reason the film is rated ¨R¨ as the violence is extreme with cruel killings , besides some sex scenes.In United States attained a moderated success in spite of nomination to various Oscars , though only obtained one award to support cast for Renee Zellweger . In Europe achieved much more success at the box office . The picture has spectacular sets and some wonderful snowy and natural landscapes. Many of the scenes were shot in the Carpathian mountains in Romania . The production design and set design by Dante Ferretti is breathtaking .Jude Law and Nicole Kidman interpretation is top notch likeness to Renee Zellweger rightly rewarded . The secondary actors are first rate : The hideous Ray Winstone , the renegade priest Philip Seymour Hoffman , the kind Bernard Gleeson , everybody are good. Gabriel Yared musical score is romantic and magnificent and John Seale cinematography is astounding and stunningly made . Anthony Mingella direction is accurately developed but there're some moments with slightly slow movement . The flick will appeal to emotion enthusiasts and romantic films fans . Rating: Very good . Above average , well worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,History
My brief review of the film,"A strongly acted and always interesting portrait of the hardships that came with the American Civil War, not only for soldiers but for those who did not fight too. The times are portrayed well, with sets and costumes that cannot be faulted. What can be flawed in the film however is the central romance, which is without much spark or realism. But all the action surrounding the romance is great, with some good-natured humorous touches, wonderful supporting characters and the perfect picture overall of life during the American Civil War. The cast is superb, with Zellweger in particular undergoing a superb transformation from her typical roles. The film is generally well written and well directed by Minghella, so that in spite of a lackluster romance, the film is still a captivating and entertaining watch.",7.0,Anonymous,History
It's the lasting effects of war on the idividuals...,"Anthony Mingheller's astounding film cleverly sweeps the audience into the horrors of war at its beginning.  He then introduces his two principle characters who would gradually move the audience into their world wrought by war and hardship. We watch as the characters begin to unravel their internal tortures and their need to subdue their isolation to face their regrets and hope for the future.  This is an absolutely fabulous movie that portrays the stunning performances of its stellar cast of actors and the overwhelming raw landscapes that are kept in sync with their events and moods.  Observe the stages of emotional changes in the characters. So amazingly and magnificently captured at different camera angles, from scene to scene against the cold, mountainous countryside!This film isn't throwing off longwinded dialogue and lengthy physical encounters between Jude Law's Inman and Nicole Kidman's Ada to reveal the meeting of two souls searching for a meaningful existence.  Yep, it's that brief and silent stare of Inman as he confronts the graciously low-keyed, prim and proper Ada that explicitly puts their sensory awareness of each other so powerfully on screen.  As the events flow, I was completely mesmerized by the Inman character watching him transcend to his sense of isolation and his developing disillusion with his world. On the other hand, I couldn't take my eyes off the immaculately well-bred and gorgeous Ada as she succumbs into a scrawny hapless damsel in complete distress.  It's fascinating to watch the couple adapt to situations beyond their control and to study the emotional and behavioral attitudes of two human beings altering at such opposing magnitude as a result of one war.  Observe how the once popular Inman slips into desolation in the battlefield, becoming even more tormented from his world as he meets up with some very strange characters. Will he ever find solace with these characters, or with Ada at the end? Will Ada, while feeling alienated from her new abode, at the beginning of the film and with the death of her father, be able to battle her insecurity to become spiritually enlightened and physically capable with the help of her new acquaintances?  Is she able to embraces what the farmland has to offer her? And will Inman be capable of escaping what the gruesome battlefield has come to mean to him?  This film lays out an enormous ground for the examination of the effects a war on different individuals.The film continues to remind the audience that Ada and Inman are bound together by their haunting memories of one another.  That, indeed, is beautifully captured by the expressions on Law and Kidman's faces. The symbolisms, throughout the film, are plentiful and brilliantly ascribed, allowing the audience to join the dots to the destinies of the couple. Even crows, clearly suggesting doom and destruction, never fail to demonstrate the dark instincts that trouble a man's soul. And those women Inman meets in his journey seem to trigger the expectation of the audience to see him drawing closer to the woman he loves and to home.  Even these characters, encountered by Inman, provide a picture of how different people react to the war. But will war ultimately bring peace and safety to its protagonists? This film is a masterpiece that will provide much food for thought.Renee Zwellweger is phenomenal in her boisterously loud 'Ruby' role. She brings another aspect of the American woman that's so different in breeding from Kidman's Ada.  Both are educated in their different cultural way of life.  What can Ada learn from Ruby, the frontier woman who sees the 'hands and knees' toiling as the only way of survival in her community? Zwellweger provides the comic relief that's much needed for this powerfully intense film.  She's superb in her role as the beacon of strength and hope for injecting a meaningful existence of living. Unlike the soldiers or the hypocritical Home Guard authorities that use guns to destroy their enemies, Ruby uses her hands-on skills to beat the odds of survival. It's uncannily delightful to watch her interacting with Kidman's character. She, Law and Kidman are definitely worthy of being recipients of the Oscar statuettes. They exhibit their superb non-stop performing talents in this film with their onscreen appearances. The Q&A session with Brendon Gleeson (who plays Ruby's father), has prompted me to want to go see this movie again - to watch closely how the strength of the film's womenfolk can make a difference to the human beings' survival instincts.  I want to study again how hellish wars are for destroying and crippling, not only the physical, but the mental aspects of the masculine race.  And Gleeson does drive home an interesting question: When these mountain folks `volunteer' to fight a war, how come they should be penalized as deserters if they were to decide to opt out of it?This film is a MUST-SEE. It's beautifully crafted, assembled, and absolutely mesmerizing in all aspects of filmmaking techniques and style. The music score and soundtracks are so appropriate locked into the events and the moods of the characters. And the film's title? It does project its allegorical appeal.A+",,Anonymous,History
"This movie works, but it is no ""Gone With The Wind""","This movie worked for me because I see this movie as an exact opposite of 'Gone With The Wind.' Farm owners instead of plantation owners. Scarlett fights and connives for what she wants; Ada gets depressed and turns inside herself until Ruby, (Renee Zellweger,) shows up to save the day. Sort of, in a round about way. Deserters instead of officers trying to get back to their families, the lists goes on and on. Even the love story was opposite. If this is what the producer and writers were trying to get across it succeeded with me.There are only two things I didn't like about the movie, the rest I thought was well done and I liked it enough to recommend it to friends. First, I couldn't see the attraction between Inman, (Jude Law), and Ada, (Nicole Kidman,) as being strong enough for Inman to desert to get back to her. Inman said he only had written to her a few times where Ada wrote to him almost constantly. Second, something or someone getting killed or dying in almost every scene was a little much. I must say it was full of action because of that, but after about the second scene I knew something or someone was going to die in the next scene. I like to be surprised by the next scene, not know what is going to happen before it does.I thought all the acting was very well done, with Zellweger the best. She deserved the credit she got for it. I thought she played the part of the hillbilly girl very well. She must have done her homework on the part. Zellweger even said in the movie that she was smarter than people thought she was. I think that was true. Law did well with his part with all he had to go through to get back to Kidman. It must have been a lot stronger love to go through all that than I thought it was. Now he showed a lot of emotion in his face during his trials. Kidman's part may have had something to do with the fact I chose her performance after the other two. Except when she was depressed she didn't show much emotion, I don't know if that is how the part was written or if that is how she perceived the part. She still did a good job, I just thought the other two were better.I liked the scene with the Zellweger, Kidman and the rooster, even though it was one of those scenes I mentioned above. I thought the 'Home Guard' was exactly as they probably were back then. Even though we don't hear much about them they were a part of that time. I thought the scenery was beautiful. The movie had everything needed to be a good historical romance.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Hope in Times of Despair,"Anthony Minghela's (writer/director) Cold Mountain is a carefully constructed, sensitive, and intelligent drama set in the social context of the confederacy during the civil war. It deals with the politics of the war in a very subtle and realistic manner. While it accurately depicts the brutality and inhumanity of that war, it also does something that many films related to this period do not handle effectively - Cold Mountain studies the southern context from the inside out, and portrays changes among the non-slave owning common people wrought by the war. Almost uniquely, Cold Mountain does not over-generalize southerners, northerners or anybody else.The film surfs through genres as needed - never presenting a dull moment. It is a romance, a war story, an action-adventure and historical fiction, all nicely woven into one.The story centers on Inman (Jude Law) and Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), who are smitten with each other for very simple reasons. As this young romance begins to bud, Inman enlists in the confederate army, taking with him a book Ada has given him and a photograph of her. Ada's character is one of the most brilliant aspects of the film, which is important because the audience experiences this film from a third person perspective, but the story is clearly hers from the beginning to the end. Ada is an intelligent southern belle and daughter of a liberal minister. She begins the film as a daddy's girl skilled in many of the arts that southern women who have been surrounded by servants most of their lives were expected to learn. In other words, as she admits to Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger), she is a master of everything useless.Ada's father passes on, and she is left to manage his modest estate by herself. With no experience of this sort, she struggles, and survives by holding the memory of Inman close to her heart. Ruby enters the picture as a tough young woman who has been raised by a drunk and negligent father. Ruby has all the skills and abilities Ada lacks, and as they become inseparable business partners, they grow to love one another as best friends. Inman's experience is radically different, but something of a mirror image. During his participation in the war, he sees many friends killed for causes they don't really believe in, and decides to desert. Nobody he meets comes to his rescue as he begins the thousand mile walk back to Cold Mountain and Ada, and most of those he meets die.The bulk of the film takes place during Inman's long walk, following both of the protagonists as they live, learn, grow and change. An on-going act of will borne of desperation preserves their intense passionate love. For Inman, it is his only source of hope in a world of pure desperation. For Ada, it is very much the same thing, but also a symbol and remnant of the old south - a world which is rapidly passing.The cinematography is powerful and breathtaking. There are beautiful shots of Appalachian landscapes which give the film a strong sense of history. The script and editing are also extremely strong - emphasizing the broad class and educational differences reflected in the ante bellum southern dialects of the middle and lower classes. With the cast of this film, nothing short of perfection should be expected. And the cast, mostly, rises to the occasion. My one criticism, however, relates to the accents adopted by Kidman and Law's characters. An Australian and a Brit probably should not be expected to accurately reproduce southern American speech, but there are a few occasions where these two exceptionally gifted actors produce distracting vocal slips. I admit my oversensitivity to this, and can say with some confidence that it won't bother most people. Zellweger's performance is outstanding and she creates a character I will remember into my senescence.Very highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,History
an epic,"This movie moved me more than I was expecting, and I was fully prepared to cry. The acting mainly carried this film, with superb performances from Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger, as well as the supporting cast. These actors portrayed characters so intensely human that they lingered the remainder of the night with me, and I had trouble shaking this war drama. The costumes and cinematography were also magical, but didn't get carried away with themselves. They didn't take focus, but added to the whole effect. Cold Mountain could never become my favorite movie, as that title will always belong to The English Patient, but it's in the top five. The story itself was well developed, and stayed fairly unpredictable. I did not find myself guessing what line came next. A heart-wrenching story about humanity and war. In fact, this movie was so strongly real that it was barely noticeable it took place in the 19th century. It seemed to apply to all times.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Beautiful Romance in Times of War,"In Cold Mountain, North Colorado, near to the period of the American Civil War, the Reverend Monroe (Donald Sutherland) arrives in the small town with his daughter, the shy Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), due to health reasons. Ada meets the also shy Inman (Jude Law), and they fall in love with each other. With the beginning of the war, Inman becomes a soldier, and his great support to stay alive is the wish to see Ada in Cold Mountain again. Meanwhile, Ada meets Ruby Thewes (Renée Zellweger), a survivor of the war, who helps her in the farm and becomes her best friend. The story alternates present and past situations, disclosing a beautiful romance. I liked this film a lot. Having names such as Philip Seymour Hoffman, Natalie Portman and Giovanni Ribisi in the supporting cast, a magnificent direction of Anthony Minghella and seven indications to the Oscar, this movie does not disappoint. My remark is that there are some very important scenes deleted in the story and presented in the DVD. At least one of them, which show what happens with Sara, her baby and the three dead bodies in her farm, should not be deleted as it was. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): 'Cold Mountain'",9.0,Anonymous,History
a grand punching-bag epic of a film,"I went into this film thinking I wasn't going to like it, but hoping to be surprised, but this, much like the film, ended up being bleak and hopeless. But don't get me wrong, Minghella delivers every bit of a grand epic and for those who enjoy that kind of experience and are willing to take that adventure and accept what comes as just that, then they will not be disappointed and it will be one of the better films of the year in their opinion.  The acting is of a high quality and will most likely come away with a trinity of oscar noms for Law, Kidman and Zellweger, even though Portman's few scenes may be the most powerful in the film.  The locations are beautiful and Minghella has an eye for a good shot.However, for those like me who want the director to take them on the adventure instead of going willingly may come away disappointed mainly due to Minghella and his adaptation.  The film is so utterly bleak it makes for what I consider to be a punching bag epic which is a film that that tries to hit hard with emotion but does so to such an extreme and so often that during the film I didn't have the time to emotionally invest, or hadn't recovered from a previous blow, and it became unrealistic and consequently too difficult to really care, not to mention predictable. Overall the ""Cold Mountain"" almost left me too drained to even think back on the good aspects of the film, as all I remember is death, which may have been an original motif but ends up being the focus instead of the characters.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Depressing and Desparing,"Overly long and depressing account of mostly the Southern Homefront during the Civil War. This is not at all a pleasant time Historically and it is just the same in this well mounted Production. With Mega-Stars and Mega Character Actors it is one unpleasantness after another with very little left to the imagination.There was a lot of dreaming and romanticizing during and about this period mostly to conceal the unbelievable pain and suffering but none of that can hide here. This is an anti-war Movie no doubt and it pulls no punches in that regard. But it is so agonizing the Romantic elements can barely penetrate all the nastiness.Overall, it is a truly disturbing display of Wars inevitable intrusion into the participants lives and dramatically deconstructed the Heart and Soul and renders the most basic Humanisms, but it is not a pretty picture and is quite a despairing piece of work",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Civil War drama has epic grandeur, and yet it's a curiously draining experience...","In 1860s North Carolina, the daughter of a recently-deceased reverend awaits a handsome carpenter's return from war, unaware that he was wounded after several violent battles with the Yankees and deserted his troop; meanwhile, with no means of support, she takes in a female ranch-hand to help transpose her bedraggled farm. Director Anthony Minghella, who also adapted the screenplay from Charles Frazier's book, shows a masterly tableaux feel for wartime savagery, and his openings moments of battle are vivid, acrid, and powerful. The unconsummated love story between Nicole Kidman and Jude Law doesn't work as well, mainly due to the past-and-present story structure but also because of the casting, which fails to come off. Kidman seems too womanly for this role--too alert and capable and grown-up--so it doesn't quite wash (in the dramatic sense) for her to be pining after a young man after just one goodbye kiss (and why did she pick him in the first place? We've already been told she could have any man she wanted). Meanwhile, Law, whose haunted stare gets possibly too much screen-time, is an odd choice to play a Southern American left alienated by wartime, but Renée Zellweger gives the movie a little kick (Zellweger comes into the picture at just the right time and, though her accent doesn't completely convince, her big spirit enlivens the proceedings). Minghella treats this scenario with great care, and he triumphs with small, individual scenes (such as the slaves hiding in the cornfield with their basket of eggs, the rotting corncobs on the stalk, the drift of the first winter snow). The filmmaker tends to lose his way with the extraneous story threads, such as one involving a preacher who's about to kill a slave because ""she's got my bastard in her belly!"", one of the many howlers in the script which land with a clatter. ""Cold Mountain"" is a both forthright and shameless; its many peaks and valleys do include some good scenes, and yet the 154mn runtime is self-defeating. ** from ****",5.0,Anonymous,History
"Beautiful-looking and compelling in parts, but falls short of greatness","This film is a sad reminder that an impeccable pedigree does not guarantee an impeccable result. Great cast, a powerful story, amazing cinematography, a director whose previous two films I enjoyed immensely - so why does this movie feel so underwhelming and hollow?Well, the biggest obstacle for me is the central relationship of Inman and Ada. I love Jude Law and Nicole Kidman, but their scenes together are the weakest link that ultimately undoes the chain. In a film where your star-crossed lovers spend most of the time apart, it is crucial that one believes in their love and wishes for them to get back together, and that's just something the film fails to do completely. One could blame the fact that Ada and Inman spend barely any time together before they're torn apart by the war, but when you come down to it I simply felt no chemistry whatsoever between them. There's far more sparkles flying between the characters of Renee Zellwegger and Jack White, for crying out loud.On their own, Law and Kidman fare with varying results. Kidman's Ada turned out to be a far more sympathetic character than I expected her to be, and her growth from a helpless and clueless house plant into a self-sufficient farmer is convincing even if not exactly demanding. Jude Law tries hard to inject some humanity into Inman, but his supposed suffering over the horrors he's seen and done never really rings true.It is also a problem IMO when your main characters are getting constantly upstaged by the far more interesting supporting players. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is fantastic (as always) as a fallen priest who tries to commit a murder. I noticed that people either love or hate Renee Zellwegger's plucky Ruby. For my part I was initially distracted by her over-acting and the way every word comes out of her mouth like a pistol shot, but she definitely injects some energy and no-nonsense humour into the film. It's a flamboyant and showy part that is bound to get awards, but for my money the best supporting moment belongs to Natalie Portman as a single mother struggling to survive all by herself in the woods. The scenes with her are the most poignant and hard-hitting in the film and really make you feel that the horror and cruelties and senseless waste of war is not confined to the battlefields.Unfortunately all this good stuff is not enough to give Cold Mountain a true emotional core, or make it the sweeping epic it clearly strives to be.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Film that addresses romance, friendship and the effects of war","Cold mountain is a film that addresses big issues like romance, friendship and the harsh effects of war. It shows these things in a very open and raw way. The film's best thing that it has going for it is the excellent performances by the A list cast. Nicole Kidman is an extremely talented actress and she turns in a great performance as Ada. Jude Law also stars as Ada's love interest, even though he rarely shares the screen with Kidman, the majority of the film focuses on them living apart longing to see one another again. And that journey to return to each other is really what makes the romance great here. We also have Renee Zellweger. This is the performance that earned her an academy award. Zellweger is wonderful here, she plays a very blunt, country girl that helps out Ada with the farm. The movie's best acted moments are by Zellweger. She truly makes the viewer feel the raw emotion in her performance. The script is very well written. I love how it isn't melodramatic but it still manages to create emotion. Seeing these characters and the tragic events they go through will make you care deeply for them. But it isn't just that they go through junk, it's how they survive and the connections they have in one another. That's really what Cold Mountain is all about. It's about connections with people and learning how to keep going. 8/10. I recommend this one!",8.0,Anonymous,History
Zellweger steals the show,"Some movies has great acting that make the movie. This is a perfect example. Without Renee Zellweger giving an Oscar winning performance, this movie would not have been enjoyable. Her portrayal of Ruby Thewes, the tough talking farm girl who doesn't take nothing' from nobody. It was this character that saved the movie.The movie focuses on the journey taken by Inman (Jude Law) on his way back from the Civil War to find his lover Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman). On this journey he comes across some unsavory characters and has to tough it out to find his way back to Ada. Meanwhile, Ada must keep try and keep the farm with the help of Ruby. Ada doesn't know much about farming but since her father just passed away, she must make it or break it. Hiding two deserters from the war, one being Ruby's father, doesn't make things easier with the local law enforcement always keeping an eye out on the area for people hiding deserters.This movie isn't terrible, but it isn't unbelievable either. If it weren't for Zellweger's performance, the movie would not be even close to the caliber of greatness. It is a good watch with some thrills and entertaining portions. The journey that Inman embarks on isn't an easy one and does have its surprises. Overall Cold Mountain is worth a viewing but may not be the right choice to buy. This film isn't for everyone but for those who like great acting, this is the place.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Invested with nobility,"Anthony Minghella knew something of the Civil War in locating his story in North Carolina. Of all the states that seceded to form the Confederacy, North Carolina may have been the most reluctant. It's Governor Zebulon Vance who is mentioned in the story dragged his feet in giving help to the Confederate government and its citizens save for the east where the plantations were never really embraced the Southern cause. Jude Law's attitude about fighting for a rich man to own slaves was not at all uncommon in North Carolina.Which after a well staged recreation of the siege at Petersburg which when the north blew up the Confederate defenses by tunneling under and mining them with explosives did not have the desired result, Law decides he's sick of war and just quits to go back to his sweetheart Nicole Kidman on Cold Mountain. In the meantime Nicole is having her own problems just keeping body, soul, and property together on the small family farm. So the film proceeds along two tracks of Law's journey and Kidman's problems.The stronger track for me is clearly Kidman and her problems. Renee Zellweger won a Best Supporting Actress Award for playing a young white trash woman who Kidman takes on for just board and feed to help with the farm. Without her help the farm's survival would be problematic although she has to put up with some pithy observation as well. Zellweger invests this simple character with so many dimensions her performance even without the Oscar capping it is her personal best. Kidman while not to the plantation manor born being the daughter of minister Donald Sutherland also is not used to manual farm labor. She grows in character as the film progresses.As for Law and Kidman as well he has to worry about the Home guard, a self appointed group of militia taking over because official government machinery has broken down. Probably before the war they were slave catchers, now they hunt deserters and those who aid and abet them. Giovanni Ribisi also scores well as a young man in the home guard who declined to serve at places like Petersburg. Ribisi is some piece of work.Besides Zellweger's Oscar, Cold Mountain was deservedly nominated for a flock of other Oscars. It's a marvelous look at the decline of the Confederacy, a cause that simply would not die quietly. In its own way the survivors are invested with the same kind of nobility that the Gone With The Wind cast was.",8.0,Anonymous,History

A film without insight into good and evil,"Loosely based on Homer's 'Odyssey', 'Cold Mountain' tells the story of the final days of the American Civil War, and one man's struggle to get home. Unfortunately, it's also a world where the heroes, even when supposedly starving, have 21st century muscles, and the heroines all have 21st century teeth. More than that, they have 21st century values as well: I'm not saying that all southerners were slave-owning bigots, but the film establishes very early on where it's coming from, where the hero shows, in the very first scene, what was surely very unusual courtesy from a southerner to a black man, while shortly afterwards the heroine declares her happiness to be away from slaves, though without specifying the nature of her objection. Which means, of course, that the film offers no insights into how white people, viewed as having the highest moral character in their own community, could have fought a war ultimately for the purpose of the right to enslave others. Meanwhile, the various foes who stand in the path of a happy ending are all depicted as evil and venal, in contrast to the nobility and modernity of the sympathetic characters. This is less history than 'The Lord of the Rings'; where moral merit is not a judgement passed on a set of behaviours in a particular environment, but rather an innate property of the good and the beautiful.",5.0,Anonymous,History
I imagine God is weary of being called down on both sides of an argument.,"Cold Mountain is directed by Anthony Minghella who also adapts to screenplay from Charles Frazier's novel of the same name. It stars Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, Renée Zellweger, Eileen Atkins, Kathy Baker, Brendan Gleeson, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Ray Winstone and Natalie Portman.Music is scored by Gabriel Yared and cinematography by John Seale. Plot finds Law as W.P. Inman, a wounded deserter from the Confederate army who is trying to make his way back to North Carolina to rekindle a fledgling romance with Ada Monroe (Kidman).This is Minghella's world and the American Civil War movie gets a double shot in the arm as Cold Mountain not only deals in the home front, but also in the perilous life of the soldier. Add into the mix a fire cracker of an opening, a central romance and an array of expertly drawn characters, and it's safe to say that Minghella's film is not only epic in production, but also in story telling. In essence the film is about love, friendships and learning to cope under the most trying of circumstances, but the director doesn't paint it with a sentimental brush. As the three strands of the narrative play out, tone is often gritty, intense, sorrowful even, with Minghella cribbing from the Anthony Mann Western book by having the stunning landscapes form part of the characters emotional world.Come back to me, come back to meStory is strong, even if the key romance is soft; since it's told mostly in flash backs, but those flash backs are threaded into the main seam of Ada's life on the home front and Inman's perilous odyssey. She, befriended by hard working, dirty handed, Ruby Thewes (Zellewegger excellent); who also provides the only moments of levity within, he, meeting up with a number of interesting characters, both good and bad. This of course makes the film episodic, but in this instance it's a good thing, mainly because characters are so utterly compelling. Hoffman as a less than honourable priest and Portman as a young woman out in a wood cabin, alone with her sick baby, they stand out. But there's also the Home Guard attached enforcers led by blood thirsty Teague (Winstone) and a potent thread involving Ruby's fiddle playing father, Stobrod (Gleeson as usual a considerable screen presence).On the technical front it's hard to find fault, it's a tip top production. Romania's mountains, rolling hills and forests form the backdrop to most of the action, with John Seale's Academy Award nominated photography neatly passing for a rugged North Carolina. While the costumes, set design and Yared's score also add impetus to the feel of the time. There's some minor itches, such as fluctuating accents and the delicacy of the romance lacking the passion to drive such a journey by Inman on, but they are not flaws. Such is the strength of Minghella's story telling ability, Cold Mountain still comes out as great cinema. A film that can stay in your mind for days after viewing it. Bleak yet subtle, savage yet tender, a different sort of Civil war movie. Amen to that. 9/10",,Anonymous,History
Civil war aftermath,"Any war brings disasters to any nation or territory. American civil war was not an exception of these calamities, and in my opinion, this is what the director Anthony Minghella wanted to emphasize in this drama starred by young Jude Law and backed by Nicole Kidman and always efficient Renée Zellweger. The plot is about the love of a young couple, W.P. Inman (Law) and Ada Monroe, (N. Kidman). The first one had to go to the civil war where he was able to fight effectively and even saved the lives of some of his fellows. War was finished and he escaped from the hospital where he was recovering himself. At this point he had to overcome several serious difficulties in his way back home, he made it and found a situation of abuse by a group of gangs in his site. The couple finally decided to marry and start a new life, but the gangs once again frustrated this desire. The film is a good combination of suffering and love.",7.0,Anonymous,History
The Slender Thread,"I've always reacted against the ugliness of war. The politicians who send others to fight for them, sitting back, pontificating about the justice of battle. This is a slice of life story where two people are victims of forces they can only hope to avoid. Having read the book and knowing how it ended (no spoilers here), I sat back and watched what went on, seeing how certain figures were presented. Renee Zelwigger as Ruby, of course, dominates every scene she is in. She takes it all on. She is equipped to survive where others are not. I would like to find out if there really were groups of raiders who sought out deserters. I sometimes wonder if people knew half the time who was actually in a battalion, let alone sending out warrants on them. Were people pursued like Jude Law was? I need to find a Civil War scholar. The movie is episodic, like a modern day Odyssey. Every obstacle just leads to a more overwhelming one. Was there no kindness? Were all betrayers? Anyway, I felt a great sense of having been in a fight at the conclusion of this film. See it for its intensity and its life. Some of the acting is a bit wooden, but the course is rough and the way hard. That's what the film is all about.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Cold Mountain,"""Ada"" (Nicole Kidman) lives a comfortable life on her farm with her father ""Rev. Moore"" (Donald Sutherland) as the American Civil War comes to a close. That's where she meets and takes a shine to ""Inman"" (Jude Law) who is making his way back to his Confederate troops. When the preacher dies, ""Ada"" finds herself having to throw the fine frills and fancies in a box and struggle to maintain the property as the winter snows set in. Luckily, along comes the savvy ""Ruby"" (Renée Zellweger) who agrees to stick around and help so long as both women chip in and share the load. As the women try to survive, the war concludes and ""Inman"" sets about retracing his steps back to North Carolina. With the conditions treacherous and the territory pretty lawless, both must face the insecurity that prevails, and that is well exemplified by the odious ""Teague"" (Ray Winstone) and his brutal sidekick ""Junior"" (Giovanni Ribisi) who are roaming the territory looking for deserters, or for those who help them out. A violent fate awaits those they meet. Anthony Mingella knits the threads of their respective adventures nicely together here, with a certain inevitability, sure, but nothing too predicable. The brutality of war, the desperation of hunger, cold and depravity as well as the more visceral human needs are all shone a light on as his journey tests both the mettle and the morality of ""Inman"" and of those he meets. It's probably Winstone who takes the plaudits for me here, he really does convey a palpable sense of wickedness and Zellweger also performs well as proof that women can thrive in what is meant to be a man's world. Now it is too long, and it meanders just a little labouring the point as it goes, but the action when it happens and the strongly developed characters compensate enough for that to keep it interesting and watchable.",7.0,Anonymous,History
An American Odysseus from Penelope's Perspective,"I hesitated to see Cold Mountain. I figured it for a heroic tragedy from an officially sanctioned Southron viewpoint in the vein of Gone With the Wind. But to my pleasant surprise Cold Mountain was very different anti-heroic and anti-war to the point that I'm surprised top see that the Bush administration allowed it in the theatres. Perhaps Cheney left no instructions.Cold Wind is an ant's eye view of the Civil War's impact on the Carolina Highlanders, an everyday in the life of story of the frightening last days of the Confederacy. The Highland lads have been dragged off to fight for slaves they did not have. Many included Inman (Jude Law) have become disillusioned and have deserted the Lost Cause. Rebel officialdom has branded them traitors and ordered them hunted down and shot or returned to the crumbling front lines breaking under the pressure of Yankee raiders.Back home genteel Ada (Nicole Kidman) sits on her front porch reading books as she pines away awaiting Inman's return and as the farm goes to seed. Wooed by an offensive, murderous member of the home guard, Ada is content to live off the generosity of neighbors who have little to spare. There is only hope for Inman's return; no word has been heard; postal service has deteriorated from sporadic to non-existent. Outside of die-hards in the Home-Guard freed from service at the front, most locals are praying for the cause to be lost and the end of the war.Enter roughneck Ruby (Eileen Aikens) who forces Ada off her pedestal into the real world of living off the sweat of the brow and brings the farm back to productivity. Ruby came from a family dysfunctional even for its times and despite her hatred of her Pa, she saves him from capture by the Home Guard. Ruby says of the men who planned the war being lost that ""They go out into a thunderstorm; stand there till they're drenched and all they can say is 'Sh - - it's raining.'""Inman's Homeward Odyssey is laden with traps: sirens, the home guard and yankee raiders.Will Ada and Inman survive the tempest?

Better than i thought and yet somehow not as good as i expected,"Well, i expected, for all the hype and Oscar nominations, an epic Civil war drama (& something with the ""magnitude"" of the ""English Patient"" given the same director). This film isn't of epic stature, but it turns out i was relieved it wasn't.  It's a love story in the midst of the horrors of war where young men are sent off to fight, deserters are tracked and killed, and the women and children at home are left to fend for themselves while the men are gone.Anyway i thought Nicole Kidman and Rene Zelleweger were pretty decent and not knowing much about Jude Law, he was all right, also.  It seems Rene Z. had the more fun part of the 3 leads and was able to smartly play a spirited, feisty downhome woman with much aplomb.  Also for me it was good to see actress, Kathy Baker...someone's who's talent needs to be more recognized/acknowledged.This film is worth seeing this -- i'm can't articulate why really, but maybe because it is a slice of Americana.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Overblown, Tedious, Boring Melodrama","Kidman and Law lack the chemistry to make this sloppily directed, poorly written romance/melodrama work on any level other than grandiosity. Kidman pouts andpines wistfully for her absent lover Law. She's just met him when he's whisked off to do battle for the South in the Civil War, and they've only exchanged about 5 sentences and one kiss, yet they're totally smitten. Law's main direction throughout seems to be `Look vacant and shell-shocked, but sensitive.' Rene Zellweger is about the only spark in this dreary script, but she plays it way too broad and over the top, like she was starring in `Annie Get Your Gun.' Yee-hah boy howdy! Something about her character felt more like it belonged in a Monty Python sketch - the one from `Holy Grail' where the peasants spend all their time wallowing in muck making mud pies for no reason. Kidman is a smart enough actress to stay out of her way whenever she can. Their scenes together are like a comic book hidden inside a Victorian Era novel.Whenever the action bogs down into total tedium, which is frequently, all the writers do is shout `Cue the Simon Legree-type Villain!' and Teague (Ray Winstone) comes galloping out of nowhere to do his unspeakably dastardly acts, like kill and torture innocent God-fearing townspeople in the name of loyalty to a fast-fadingConfederacy. All other times, he's missing in action, which is preposterous even in this cornball script. There is a plethora of other talented actors who give credible performances in small roles. These are the characters Law meets as he does his Johnny Appleseed trek from the front lines, where he has deserted, to the hopefully loving embrace of Kidman back in Cold Mountain. Ultimately though, none of these characters matter. Law has no time for them or their lives. Each of these little mini-movies has the same tired theme: war is gol-durn heck, and turns otherwise decent Christian folk into rabid animals.And the script is far too predictable, too heavy-handed. Moreover, the pacing of the story is dreadfully slow. You spend the entire movie waiting for Romeo and Juliet's inevitable reunion, with Kidman wringing her hands and sighing, Law overcoming incredible odds and dodging bullets. And when it finally comes you just don't care anymore. You'll be looking at your watch wondering how much more of this clap you have to endure.I give it one star out of five for the battle scenes. There is a potent anti-war message here. The incredible lack of concern for the loss of life by the Generals on both sides of the conflict is powerful stuff. But it's only about 15 minutes of this 150-minute dog.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"Stunning photography, fine performances but flawed script and mixed results...","There are so many good things to praise in COLD MOUNTAIN that it pains me to say that staying with it to the very end is sometimes difficult because it drags in spots and some of the story-telling techniques are awkwardly staged.Nothing but kudos for the casting. Nicole Kidman and Jude Law are in top form--with Law hiding his good looks most of the time under beard, stubble or mud. Renee Zellweger makes us understand why she won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role as the tough but tender-hearted Ruby. Cinematography and background score are tops.By the time the two lovers have been reunited for the finale, much has happened in the way of showing how war brutalizes men. Anthony Minghella doesn't flinch from showing the harsh realities of battle and then switching to scenes of pastoral splendor on the home front.It's a film in which all the ingredients are put together with exceptional craftsmanship. So much so, that you wish the script had been a little stronger to make the two hours and thirty-four minutes more absorbing. Unfortunately, it tends to take too long to tell a tale that lacks the power of holding interest once it gets past the midway point.Nevertheless, anyone interested in the Civil War period will find this a meticulous work as far as costumes, settings and use of folk music is concerned.But be warned: This bittersweet romance at times is downright depressing and the gritty war scenes (and the brutality of certain Yankee soldiers) are about as graphic as such battle scenes usually get. The overall feeling is one of awe that so much has been accomplished and yet there is something unsatisfying about the tale itself.",,Anonymous,History
Good movie!,"Cold Mountain could have been more like Frasier's book, but what can you do.The movie is beautifully shot, with great care given to the costumes and landscapes. The peaceful Southern countryside has an almost mystical air, of some far-off legend which cannot exist in the modern world. There is plenty of action and heroism, and a suitably grand battle scene to end things. It's all been done before, but this does not mean the movie is not entertaining.The one problem I have had was the over-use of cheap devices to provoke emotion, which had the action bordering on melodrama on several occasions. We don't need slow, sad music and slow-motion footage every time some character dies or gets hurt. Subtly inserting emotional content is one thing, but this film takes it and beats you over the head with it, then shoves it down your throat. It felt rather insulting and unnecessary, almost like the sad equivalent of a laugh track. But perhaps it was just me.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Minghella brings to the screen the harsh, human brutality of war and its consequences in a mini-epic version as well as primarily offering the audience a haunting and powerful love story through looks, voice-overs, behavior, pregnant pauses with tidbits of humor. Nicole offers another outstanding performance along with Jude Law and Renée Zellweger in capturing the idealistic love of passion and commitment. Implicit in this movie is the insanity of war and its demeaning and cruel outcomes, particularly on women.

Good depiction of a little noticed by-product of the Civil War,"If you are a Civil War or American History buff, then you'll appreciate how this film addresses an ignored aspect of that violent part of our past known as the war between the states. Although mired in a somewhat predictable and sappy love story, it pointed out very well how many common folks were abused by their own people as these miscreants preyed upon their vulnerability. Beautifully photographed, with set designs accurate to the era. I thought Nichole Kidman was miscast in the primary role, which is difficult for me to admit as I believe she is one of the most talented actresses in the business today. However, it was Renee Zellweger who stole the movie. This actress never lets her ego get in the way of playing any part, even if that part lacks glamor. I recommend this film on several levels -- acting, directing, and historical significance. Weakened only by a trite ending.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Rebel with a cause: but he gave it up,"Very enjoyable film about a southerner who gleefully goes off to battle only to find it wasn't the grand adventure he had envisioned. Sick of the carnage he takes the long road home, experiencing many rough knocks as he does. The picture bounces back and forth from 1861 to 1863 showing us the man before and after his soldiering experience. Primarily we see his relationship with a woman as it gets a rocky start and gradually forms into something permanent. Many fine performances in the movie made it memorable; I particularly liked the interplay between Ruby and Ada. I had to laugh a couple of times at Ruby's habit of counting off points she wanted to make. Hilarious. Well played out ending; fit in well with the mood preceding it.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Emotional and Balanced View of the Civil War,"Cold Mountain was nominated for several Golden Globes, including Best Motion Picture Drama.  When time for the Oscars came, however, and the Best Picture nominees were released, Cold Mountain had been replaced by Lost in Translation.  I was further surprised when I realized that this movie was not unanimously acclaimed by critics.  Yet I knew that since there was such controversy over this film, there was all the more reason for me to see it. I came out of the theater having watched a very good movie, but after seeing the movie I also realized why many critics would not praise this motion picture.  Let me explain.First of all, the music from Cold Mountain, both the original songs by various artists and the original score by Gabriel Yared, was nothing short of incredible and I felt that it matched the film very well.  The film rightfully received three Oscar nominations for its original music.  Also, both Jude Law and Renee Zellweger put in solid, emotional performances, and Zellweger rightfully won her Best Supporting Actress Academy Award.  I also felt that the dialogue was well-written and genuine, evoking a flow of emotion from the audience.  The tragic aspects of the film are also shown to be full of emotion, and the story is paced well. The view of Civil War is well-balanced, showing corruption on both sides.However, my one complaint was the often awkward acting and staging by and for the minor characters.  They are obviously seen to be in a league not of their own.  One of the most controversial aspects of the film is Kidman's performance.  I felt that she played her role well, even though her makeup often made her seem out of place.  The other reason that many seemed to hate this film is because it seems to be a poor adaptation of Charles Frazier's book, focusing more on the love story than on the fighting itself.  I have not read the book, so I can not truly affirm or discredit this idea, but Minghella obviously focuses on the love story in order to make the film as emotional as possible.  I feel that this was a good choice in his writing and direction.Overall, a few minor flaws (as mentioned above) and some unneeded sex and nudity keep this one from reaching its full potential, which is a shame, especially as one considers the caliber of cast and crew involved with this movie.Final Grade: A-.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Cold Mountain(2003),"The actors performances were phenomenal. Renee Zellweger's character Ruby adds a lightheartedness to the film at the right times in otherwise a very bleak film. Nicole Kidman is also superb. The film includes a love interest, several nasty characters and some odd balls as well. So, it's always interesting and there's plenty going on to keep you watching throughout the two and a half hours.Also noteworthy are the small roles of Natalie Portman, Philip Seymore Hoffman, Donald Sutherland, Giovanni Ribisi. Jude Law turn in a compelling performance. This is a gorgeous film to watch, with deserved credit given to cinematographer , it is photographed in such a manner that you almost lose yourself in the spectacle of the moment. The war scenes are just brilliant and very much the highlight.The film score of the 2003 film Cold Mountain is particularly good and features original compositions from Jack White, Sting, and Elvis Costello. The best music in the film is ""shape-note"" music, an a cappella, traditional form of folk hymn singing that dates to Colonial times. Also known as Sacred Harp music, it's enjoying a revival after being featured in the film ""Cold Mountain"". An epic sweep about a brutal adventure set in the final days of the Civil War. The soundtrack is a perfect fit for the film's setting and the series of events. Diffidently worth seeking out.The hard core hillbilly white gospel is so good in Cold Mountain I have sung a fair amount of this style as a 1st tenor I lived in Virginia when I was 8-9 years old. I acquired a lot of white hillbilly gospel and black gospel at a really young age . My Mother did not know what to make of it. She considered the genres as wild music and always scratched her head as to why I liked it at such a young age ! I like the atonal sensibilities. I have a vast Black and Hillbilly gospel and mountain music collection still today with records dating back to late 60's and early 70's !",8.0,Anonymous,History
Finding the long way home.,"I had heard news and stories about this movie before and so this kind of piqued my curiosity when I saw this on the cable days ago.I don't know much about the Civil War and all that, I have to say first. Given I only understand this is based on Charles Frazier's novel about the final days of the Civil War and that is it.It's the final days of the Civil War. Inman (Jude Law), being wounded from the war, slowly made his way home to Cold Mountain to be together with his sweetheart Ada (Nicole Kidman) once more. Along the way he had to overcome various obstacles as he had learnt that those soldiers who had escaped will have to be brought back to be on the battlefront once more. Something definitely not all those who had escaped wanted.Also at the same time, Ada is trying to keep her faith that Inman is still alive and well. She even got a helper for the house and it's in the form of gutsy Ruby (Renee Zellweger).I was almost horrified looking at the war how some of the soldiers treated the ordinary folk. Looking at how Ada and Ruby are like, they cannot be more different from each other. Maybe Renee's convincing portrayal of Ruby was the reason why she won at the Golden Globes and the Oscars as well.Maybe for someone like me who may not understand the historical aspects of the Civil War, but then maybe at least the love story part kind of won me over.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"The fatal flaw with the film, and why Nicole Kidman will lose her career if she's not careful.","Cold Mountain alternates between the stories of Nicole Kidman, waiting at home for her sweetheart to return from the civil war, and Jude Law, her sweetheart trying to find his way back to her. For conflict we have a rather nasty band of home guard who race around killing deserters... But Jude Law is a deserter... oh no! Run, Jude, run!Another period tragedy masquerading as romance adapted from a famous novel by Anthony Minghella. This time its a sweethearts separated by the civil war ""tell me a tale"" story. The plot is Mills and Boone / Midday Melodrama, but so exquisitely filmed with such an exquisite soundtrack that we hardly notice. It maintains a sombre tone throughout, and goes for tears almost non-stop.I've pinned down the fatal flaw with the film. I felt that Kidman and Law had zero chemistry: that the film worked, but when the two finally met up, it felt wrong, like they were two separate satellites, individually fine, but there was nothing between them. Its built into the structure of the movie. The two hardly know each other before he goes off to war: they kiss, she gives him a photo and speaks in a poor southern accent, and that's it. Then they spend the entire movie not sharing the screen. They have their completely separate story-lines: him at war, and then journeying back to her; her at home waiting for him. So by the time they finally meet, we have gotten to know them both as independent from each other - and somehow this fits. Which is why it seems wrong once they're together. And there's the fact that Kidman is an ICE QUEEN!She's becoming increasingly cold and distant - and looking more and more like Vivien Leigh. If she's not careful, she may just end up like Vivien. Her career is in danger of disappearing if she doesn't come back down to earth, experience the real world and real people again.For a female protagonist in this film we needed somebody who the audience could associate with, imprint themselves on - instead we have someone with only relevance to her insulated celluloid world than to us, the audience. She's like a porcelain doll: elegant, but nothing to do with reality.Zellweger is a definite scene-stealing highlight. A unique, vibrant character - almost a broad character, but not a 2D character.5/10. Everything about its look is 10/10 stuff. Superb cinematography, great performances from Jude Law, albeit iffy southern accents right the way through, and despite the fact that I did not like Kidman at all in this, I enjoyed it, but its flawed, to my mind, by the lack of a chemistry, and Nicole Kidman's unwelcoming, mannered persona.",5.0,Anonymous,History
"Worth watching even if ""brought to you by Mattel.""","There are a couple of things wrong with this episodic, rather sweeping film, but not enough to destroy it. Fortunately, the good outweighs the bad enough to make it worthwhile viewing. Law plays a shy, but thoughtful young man in Cold Mountain, NC. When the local minister's daughter (Kidman) moves to town, he is immediately taken with her and they share a few very brief, very stifled moments (including an impromptu kiss) before he leaves to fight in the Civil War. (An opening battle scene is so intense that the impact of it literally tears the clothes off one participant!) As they each experience great change, disappointment and destruction, it is their longing for each other that keeps them going. He can't wait to get back to her and she can't wait for him to come back. As Law treks across the southeastern coast, he comes upon a wide variety of opponents and allies. These are all played with great skill by a terrific gallery of solid, semi-name actors (Hoffman, Ribisi, Portman, Atkins, etc......) Meanwhile, Kidman faces the end of her gentle existence and almost existence itself until a scrappy, brassy local girl steps in to rescue her. Zellweger plays this feisty, mouthy girl, using every ounce of her acting prowess. The pair must fend off an opportunistic home guardsman played by a slimy Winstone. The film lurches forward with the all-important reunion moment dangling in front of the viewers like a carrot on a stick. It is solely due to the acting talent and intense chemistry of the stars and not the sketchy, spotty script that this moment carries any dramatic weight at all. Somehow, Law and Kidman manage the impossible, which is to create a romance and desire for one another that is never properly developed on the screen. They are forced to create everything through their expressions and body language and do just that. As good as they are, they are almost completely overtaken by the surprisingly wondrous and intriguing work of Zellweger. Her welcome dash of vinegar and bluntness is a perfect counterpoint for the dewy and sensitive lovers. Also, of particular note is another surprise - the downright striking job that Portman does as a lonely widow and mother. She outdoes herself in this brief role. As a matter of fact, nearly every performance in the film is excellent. The one exception is the horribly anachronistic and inexplicable presence of the peroxide blonde henchman to Winstone. His punk-rock, eyelinered look and shopping-mall line delivery remove the viewer from the already tenuous time period whenever he's on screen. (And is it ever stated why someone his age isn't IN the war??) That's one other problem. There is very little period feel to this film. It always seems like the actors are playing with clothes they found at Western Costume with their make up done by Ben Nye. Kidman's hair, while lovely, is absolutely ridiculous. It distracts from and detracts from scenes very often. Ditto her make up. One key scene near the end is a close up and her heavy mascara and shadow grey/purple eyeshadow (masterfully applied by those Hollywood wizards) turn what should have been an agonizing emotional moment into ""Barbie Does the Civil War"". Zellweger does better in the make-up department, though her chemically-whitened teeth do not go very far in suggesting her character's background. Her deliberately tousled hair is also a problem at times, but nowhere near the level of Kidman's. These are quibbles in light of the bigger problem which is an overriding predictability. Even to one who has never read the book, there is no doubt as to the ending of the film. There is very little room for surprise and what there is of that is telegraphed again and again. So the audience is left watching a 2-1/2 hour film with a foregone conclusion. (And this sometimes meandering work was originally FIVE hours long!) The amount of footage left on the cutting room floor makes for some uncomfortable continuity (such as when a character is tortured and watches 3 family members slaughtered and is next seen smilingly dancing a Christmas jig!) Nevertheless, the romance and beauty of the film still delivers and there is no doubt that Kidman is a MOVIE STAR. She glows and glistens and has every accommodation made to her. Even her old riding coat looks runway perfect. Law is achingly beautiful in the early scenes, but delivers a sincere, dedicated performance in spite of his physical features (which are all but buried as it wears on.)",,Anonymous,History

A visually stunning film with a great score and solid performances,"Minghella's cold mountain is a visually stunning and dramatically great film in adapting the famous Frazier novel. There are few films that one can say covered the task of adapting a novel into a screenplay and doing it well. I can say this about this film. The story is a bout a couple that is drawn apart because the man (Law) must go fight for the south in the civil war. The woman is left in ""Cold Mountain"" with no family and little friends. Nicole Kidman gives a solid performance as the woman while Jude Law was great as the man. THe film is well-acted for the most part. Most of the supporting actors are memorable in their short parts (especially Sutherland, P.S. Hoffman, and Giovani Ribisi). The film has a beautiful score and cinematography, the highlights for me.

Brilliant direction and great performance by the cast,"Kudos to Jude Law and Nicole Kidman ( and how can I not mention the mouthy and boisterous Renée Zellweger). They were bloody brilliant in the movie. Albeit the story moulded itself in a predictable fashion, it was exceptionally well directed by Anthony Minghella. Love was what bound them together (Jude and Nicole), although the moments were brief and the talks were tacit, Nicole kept on waiting patiently for Law while he eagerly wanted to return for her. A great love story, I'd say, hardly possible in today's scenario. While we always want things to end up happily, the movie ends up with a sad note. While I watched the flick I had a premonition that something bad was going to happen eventually.Natalie Portman's role was brief although very well portrayed as a widow. Giovanni Ribisi and Philip Seymour Hoffman performed their part very well. Renée Zellweger surely deserved an Oscar for her performance. She was brilliant and fluent with her accent. Nicole Kidman was amazing in the flick. While the whole world crumbled upon her and the wicked self proclaimed sheriff Ray Winstone kept on coming at her house asking her to give up but she wouldn't. She kept on patiently waiting for Law to come back as he had promised her. The war had separated them and that war demanded every man from the Cold Mountain to show up while the crude Ray Winstone didn't allow anyone who absconded from the war to live as he hunted them down wherever he found a runner.Jude Law had to return for her. She had to wait for him. That is the basis of the entire story. It was a well written story by Charles Frazier with a brilliant screenplay by Anthony himself. A wonderful love story with marvellous dialogues and great acting by the actors in the flick. I would rate this movie a 7 on 10. Albeit the story went on in a predictable fashion it was brilliantly directed and well produced eventually. It managed to wet the cheeks of the viewers and that is what acting and directing is all about.",7.0,Anonymous,History
You know it's an epic when...,"... it spans across 2½ hours, stars a wide-ranging montage of Hollywood stars, features unspeakably picturesque shots, evokes dramatic comparisons of 'Gone with the Wind Redux' and, more than anything, scored over seven Oscar nods with the Academy. 'Cold Mountain' boasts of all of the aforementioned accolades, although it is not usually hailed by critics or fans, possibly because this swelly dramatic Civial War set-up means treading down a road we've all been down before.Although there is perhaps not much novelty in Anthony Minghella's long epic, the end result is much better than it ought to be. Two things I feel compelled to put forth about this film: 1, how curiously low my expectations were seeing the underwhelming preview and a less-than-favourite cast of mine  only to be completely floored by a fantastic film and 2) how it is perhaps the only film I felt an urge to rewind and rewatch immediately after the end credits had started rolling. Now, I have many favourite films, but none have evoked this particular desire and as the cynic I am, I never thought I'd experience an overwhelming thing like that. This speaks volumes for me.The very core of 'Cold Mountain' is how absence makes the heart grow fonder. We see how awkward fleeting moments between the quiet, reserved Inman (Jude Law) and the rich preacher's daughter Ada (Nicole Kidman) turn into something quite profound and layered when the former is called to fight against the yankees in the Civil War. Through narrative letters, Ada communicates her longing and love for the soldier who finally decides to desert and head home to Cold Mountain to see her, not really knowing her but being swept away in the idea of his lover. While Inman embarks on a Homeric odyssey of varying degrees of humanity and desperation, Ada is at a loss as how to run a farm at home.You will be pressed to find a film that more strongly illustrates the dehumanizing effects of war on individuals and communities, even though it is a popular theme in movies. The difference between 'Cold Mountain' and heavy classics such as 'The Deep Hunter', 'Apocalypse Now' and more is that here we find a sweet core of love, and the story is infinitely brighter because of it. The screen is awash with dramatic lushly green hills, rivers, mountains and picturesque cottages and cabin logs filtered through almost unspeakably beautiful cinematography that fleets across the world with apt tracking shots. The costumework is equally impressive, capturing the bruised grace of the era as well as the gritty tragedies of war.As far as cast is concerned, I was skeptic to see Jude Law, Natalie Portman and Nicole Kidman in the same picture and expected polarised under- and over-acting. I was mostly wrong, for Nicole Kidman gives the best performance in her career as Ada Monroe with pure raw, intense emotional transparency. Jude Law, by contrast, is horribly wooden and botches through emotional scenes. Natalie Portman is not in the film for long, so there is no harm done. Every remaining actor is thankfully heartwrenching and apt in their respective roles, including a bold Renee Zellwegger as the unsinkakle hands-on-hips labourer who comes to help Ada with her decaying farm. She rightfully won an Academy Award for her performance.'Cold Mountain' is a perfect narrative with a brilliantly and patiently unfolding story, as is Minghella's style. Its only flaw, as I see it, is its inherently Oscar-baiting nature. But then again, it's a Hollywood epic about the civil war so it is presumably difficult not to fall into this trap. All I know is that it is so intense and touching that it fully trumps any film I have seen for the past months.9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,History
Certainly watchable but many things in the movie restrain it from being a masterpiece.,"""Cold Mountain"" is a beautifully made movie with a great celebrity cast, than why don't I regard this movie as a masterpiece? There are several reasons for this.The heart of the movie is the love-story between the Nicole Kidman and Jude Law character. Everything that happens in the movie evolves around the fact that both characters are deeply in love and are always on each others mind. But problem is that the love-story is not believable at all. The love-story feels unlikely because there is no chemistry between Jude Law and Nicole Kidman at all. No click, no spark no nothing at all. Maybe this is also because the love-story in the movie is very underdeveloped. The love-story is only developed in the beginning of the movie when they are still together but honestly, that period of time is too short to build an entire movie around. It makes all of the other things that occur in the movie also extra unlikely.Which brings me to another problem I had with the movie; it was highly unlikely at times. The events and characters in the movie seem to pop out of nowhere. Obviously the story is supposed to be an adventurous one but yet the movie is made too serious so all the sense of adventure and fun is not present enough. All of the events in the movie feel highly unlikely and most of them lack a point or purpose.The big celebrity cast is great to watch but is also the downfall of the movie. Most actors suddenly pop up so every time a celebrity appears on screen you're thinking; 'Hey look there is Natalie Portman and hey there is Philip Seymour Hoffman, boy this movie sure has some celebrities in it'. Point is, it works distracting from the movie and it's story. It almost feels at times like they were bragging up by showing the many famous actors they got to appear in this movie. Yes, sure the actors are just absolutely great, especially Philip Seymour Hoffman, Renée Zellweger (yes, she deserved her Oscar even though I din't always liked her character) and Natalie Portman. Still I have the feeling that the movie would had been a better one with a more 'unknown' cast in it.Only reason why I still rate this movie as 'highly' as I do is due to the obvious profession it was made with. Director Anthony Minghella shows some moments of greatness and the settings and sceneries are quite beautiful. It also is no punishment to watch the big celebrity cast in the movie, even though still the movie is a 'celebrity-overkill' at times. The movie is loved by many, so I guess this is just simply not my cup of tea.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,History
Not all that,"A kind of poor man's ""Gone With the Wind"", ""Cold Mountain"" tells of a man (Law) who falls in like with a woman (Kidman) but has to go off to fight for the CSA during the American Civil War. After the battle of Petersburg in late 1864, he deserts and spends the bulk of the 2.5 hour film humping it back home to his kinda-sorta beloved all the while bumping into all manner of peculiar hillbilly characters while Kidman does a sort of Scarlett O'Hara thing trying to maintain a stiff upper lip in the face of cold and deprivation and never having had to do labor before. ""Cold Mountain"" is a worthy albeit Hollywoodized star power and hype film about star crossed would-be lover hillbillies who struggle with the tribulations of the time. The film suffers from a thin plot with a story which is filled with side characters who contribute little to the plot and a denouement which is predictable and too little too late. Don't expect to be seeing much of bit parters Hoffman, Ribisi, Portman, or Sutherland in this long wannabe epic which fared well with critics and public alike and garnered a respectable brace of awards.

beautifully haunting,"I love this movie, I think it's beautiful and the fact that Anthony Minghella is a genius and should be treated as such. The fact that this man treats the eerie and beautiful music as another actor that he cast in this film says a lot about the man. You know, there was a time in which this did happen ladies and gents, I've talked to my great grandma and she's told me plenty about her grandpa's adventures during the civil war. Whether we like it or not, our amazing country once decided to separate and fight one another. If that doesn't amaze you, then don't watch this movie. The story is as rich as the country itself, it lingers within my heart.Anyone reading this needs to realize that in our generation, all links to the civil war will be gone, and with this the understanding of such an event will be gone too. We're losing what once made us what we are today. I love this movie; listen, love and learn about our families history. thanks :)",10.0,Anonymous,History
A whole lot less than the sum of its parts.,"Not a bad film. Not a good film either. All that talent just never manages to jell into something substantial..The main fault lies with the screenplay. Whatever charms the novel might have held were mostly lost in the translation. Supporting characters never stick around long enough to justify their presence - the hermit lady who heals Inman, for instance, adds nothing to the story line or theme that is not added elsewhere. With sparse dialogue and introverted main characters the script fails to invent ways to reveal their inner lives in ways that we really care about. And after 2.5 hours we really should care what befalls them at the end.Despite the massive promotion as the year's masterpiece the film just doesn't deliver the goods, and, to their rare credit, most critics and Academy members were able to see that behind all that sizzle there wasn't a whole lot of meat. But then again it did manage to get Jude Law and Rene Z. oscar nominations and neither perfornance particularily shouts out for such recognition.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Gone With the Wind Redux,"""Cold Mountain"" is a grand old-style, satisfyingly catch-you-up-in-the-sweep-of-emotions/resistance-is-futile Hollywood epic, whose primary difference from ""Gone With the Wind"" is that the actresses get to flash some tasteful T & A and use a four-letter word more vulgar than ""damn"" about manure.Perforce it can only be a hurried ""scenes from"" the engrossing novel which puts Penelope and Odysseus amidst the Civil War where author Charles Frazier added irony to Homer as Ada/Penelope first has to (metaphorically) learn to weave as she keeps suitors and other dangers at bay and Inman/Odysseus is not a hero but barely survives as a deserter to face parallel trials on the way home.The book at least includes a map so readers can trace Inman's lengthy Odyssey, but the movie unfortunately opts out of that 1940's-style even as it follows other conventions of the genre, particularly as seen through John Seale's beautiful cinematography from the fog of war to the fog of snow.While producers Miramax are technically not a major studio, their casting is part of what puts this in the grand Hollywood tradition.Even under dirt and mussed hair, Nicole Kidman and Jude Law are two of the mostly stunningly beautiful human beings on the planet --and it's a pretty safe bet that they'll be entered in MTV's ""Best Film Kiss of 2003""--yet they almost don't stand out amidst an attractive cameo cast with the likes of Natalie Portman, Cillian Murphy, Giovanni Ribisi, Charlie Hunnam, with Ray Winstone as the villain, etc.  It was almost startling to see Eileen Atkins's mountain woman as the first non-pretty or handsome character actor. Renée Zellweger gets to chew the scenery as an over-the-top Ma Kettle, but her comic relief is enjoyable.While the complex production design, from battles to farms to log cabins, creates whole environments, ""Ada""'s wardrobes must be pretty huge to fit all those beautiful dresses; it was only in the last days of poverty of the war that she actually had to repeat wearing one.A good deal of the credit for the irresistibility of the movie is the music, especially T. Bone Burnett's Americana and Jack White's Americana-sounding selections, and I would have preferred even more of those and a bit less of Gabriel Yared's score. Allison Krauss's singing is especially evocative in enveloping the audience in the mood and themes, in ""The Scarlet Tide"" and closing with Sting's ""You Will Be My Ain True Love"", which is a shoo-in for an Oscar nom.There was a credited dialect coach, but I found the Southern accents bland. And none of the quibbles really matter.",,Anonymous,History
Moment of irony,"It's very brief, but I couldn't help but wondering if the director meant us to see the irony. In the open battle sequence in the crater, there's a shot of Inman's Cherokee buddy struggling with a black Union soldier. To me, the image of the Native man and the African American man struggling to kill each other in a white man's war was deeply ironic, but perhaps unintended? I'd be interested in knowing if this was commented on in the book . . . Overall I though the technical quality of the film was quite high. Also, I was struck by how many Irish and English actors were used. Was this because their accents were closer to the way people in the American south spoke at the time, I wonder? I actually thought Law's performance was much more affecting than Nicole Kidman's. I think he did a nice job portraying a man who was swept up in events beyond his comprehension. And what's her name did a fine job as Ruby, just what was called for. I don't think her accent and mannerisms were over the top, rather they fit the character . . .",6.0,Anonymous,History

"Visually stunning, but overlong","I never read the novel that ""Cold Mountain"" was based on, nor do I expect I ever will, but it seems that several elements must have arrived intact from the text.The film of ""Cold Mountain"" is a sweeping romantic epic, heavy on the epic and voice-over narration, and low on any real purpose. It's a flawed, but highly entertaining piece of work that leans heavily on it's terrific musical score, cinematography, and cast of supporting characters.With an unnecessary two and a half hour running time, ""Cold Mountain"" has plenty of time to present minor characters played by familiar faces. These minor characters combined with startling war scenes and intense torture scenes together create the most vivid picture of the South during the Civil War. Unfortunately the film feels weighed down by so much material.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Two Words: Anthony Minghella,"I want to talk about Anthony Minghella, a British director, and his influence and impact on American cinema. He is one of the most awarded directors of our time, and has done films that will be classics years from now or already are (now I know that I must see ""The English Patient""). But personally, it took one screening of ""Cold Mountain"" so I could realize all his qualities as a director.First of all; perfect management of the actors. Jude Law is the finest example for this, if we explain that his two Oscar nominations as an actor were earned for his work in two of Minghella's pieces. Once in an interview, the director said: ""When I saw Jude Law, I didn't feel he was right for the role. I liked him, but he wasn't what I was looking for. But then, when I pictured Dickie, I couldn't imagine any face but his, so I called him"". And he was right, and Law's performance was great; so was Matt Damon's, and the portrayals of the whole cast. You'll never be disappointed in terms of cast when you watch an Anthony Minghella film.This is why the man has no problem in getting the best people on the industry, if only for a few minutes appearance. I'm surprised this cast didn't even get nominated for Best Ensemble in the SAG Awards. In the course of the story, we get to meet lots of wonderful characters, played sometimes for two minutes by names like Jena Malone, Cillian Murphy, Giovanni Ribisi; and larger parts by names like Natalie Portman, Kathy Baker, Donald Sutherland, Brendan Gleeson and Ray Winstone (are you reading these names?), where Gleeson clearly stands out.Continuing with actors, what I most enjoyed was when Law's character meets the great Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character, and Nicole Kidman's meets Renée Zellweger's respectively. I enjoyed it because it was amazing to see the scenes changing and watching stars of the caliber of Law and Kidman, each of them on their own, alongside the other two, not big stars, but actors I respect and like more watching on screen. I compared the talents because Hoffman is, well, a master in acting.And topic apart, Zellweger had made clear since ""Jerry Maguire"" that she urged for a deserved Oscar. Although she should have won it one or two years ago, her award for her portrayal of Ruby Thewes is more than well earned. A lot of power as always; in her words, in her looks, in her way of standingShe's so confident about what she does and that makes her perfect. At last!Then I can't forget the main stars. I don't really respect Nicole Kidman, but I pretend to accept her because she is considered an excellent actress by a ninety percent of the people. I can realize she changes a lot between performances. Changes everything, but forgets some very important details I will explain when I write about another of her movies; because her performance here is good, and helps the picture a lot. One thing I'll say; I keep on examining her beauty in all of her films, and I'll tell a friend of mine, again: She's not more beautiful than Katie Holmes.I didn't mention before, but I thought it was understood: this is Jude Law's best performance. Every part of his performance is understood too; this was a challenge (a big one) for the actor. I'd like to compare it with Adrien Brody's in ""The Pianist"". When a character suffers the changes these both characters suffer, it needs to be expressed by the actor. Brody, I've said before, seemed inexpressive in his film, with all the beard and hair in his ruined moment. With the same beard and a lot of hair, Law excels in showing he's ruined, this becomes noticeable in the way he introduces himself to people, the way he talks to them; and that's the strength and brilliance in Law's work here.From the way Law talks, we go to the screenplay, adapted by Mighella from a novel, as he did in some of his previous works. There are no hero intentions in this tale, no false words, no impossible love story. Everything is close to reality, which makes the piece a lot more powerful. In one scene, when an old lady is helping Inman (Law), she asks him: ""Why are you going to Cold Mountain?"", and he answers, almost crying: ""To find a womanAnd I barely even know her"". It's all very convincing; every moment.Going back to the main point; in the sceneries, the breathtaking war scenes and everything achieved by Minghella, show the committed director he is, and how he deserved and Oscar nod with this feature. He carried on a story that talks not just about love, but about several life aspects; and a very powerful work in every sense. With a constant melancholic tone, directed by Nicole Kidman's voice, that, even in the ending, talks about good positive things, but the music and the environment of the movie makes us think negative. I believe that's something terrifying but somehow fantastic at the same time.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Direction and acting a savior,"Anthony Minghella is a master of the old fashioned love story. His films do not house cynicism nor bad intentions. His two previous efforts, 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' and 'The English Patient,' were so good I had them at the top of my top ten lists for their respective years. In the case of 'The English Patient,' I believe it even outdid 'Fargo.' The classic beat the absurd.'Cold Moutain' is different, it is a long film. Not particularly its running length, which I don't surmise is much longer or shorter than 'Ripley' or 'Patient.' It is long because many of the actions in the film are not entirely that entertaining.We start toward the end of the Civil War. At a bombed out confederate strong-hold we meet Inman, not so different from the other soldiers. It is as if by happenstance that we should immerse ourselves into his life rather than anyone else out there. Inman, we learn, has been separated from his love, Ada. Although as we soon find out, Ada and Inman hardly know each other. It was fate, or love at first sight, that brought the two together. It was bloodshed and war that tore them apart.In ways this seems hokey, and it is. Minghella had done so well in his other films to stay away from sappy, in this one he dives right into it. As the story moves along we understand their feelings deeper, and thus some sappiness goes away, but to many it will be too heavy to bare.Inman deserts his comrades knowing the end is coming. He is far more interested in meeting up with his Ada, though the journey will be perilous. As he leaves, the Confederate Army everywhere begins to hunt down deserters and those who let them stay on their land. Inman's journey becomes an 1860s Oddysey through the American south. Along the way he meets an amorous preacher, runaway slaves, a widow and her baby, as well as your standard country cabin full of horny women.These stories are okay but lack any cohesiveness, it is the same problem that faced 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?'. 'O Brother,' however, was an all-around better film, the pace quicker and the characters better situated. All this having been said, the guilty truth is that I liked it. I tried reading the book at least four times and could not get past the first few chapters. I figured the movie had no chance.There is plenty wrong with it, but the gorgeous cinematography and exquisite acting made the film sweet enough to swallow. Listen to the names: Jude Law (as Inman), Nicole Kidman (as Ada), Philip Seymour Hoffman, Donald Sutherland, Natalie Portman. But above all, the year's best scene stealer was Renee Zellweger, a character straight out of the back-woods to help a bewildered and dainty Ada survive on the farm. The humor and life she brings to the film is enough to lift it from the despair of the rest.There is enough wrong with 'Cold Mountain' to make it a bad film. It is a credit to the fine director and gifted cast that they were able to lift a diamond out of this rough. *** out of ****",6.0,Anonymous,History

In a telling tale of love in times of war, men in times of service to country, and a women trying to cope with sudden helplessness! The ingredients are just right. This story parallels back and forth two lovers. One who goes for war and hopes to get back home to this other who is touched by some feeling that she is ready to wait till he comes back. What is really beautiful are the emotions of this young man in upholding hope of reaching back just to try and tell her that she wants to marry her. Amidst the ravages of war, the experiences in those times of men running away from their cavalry and being declared a criminal on charges of treason; is handled superbly. The subtlety of the multiple stories while the protagonist travels back is amazing. If one is really not impressed, then there are more on the other side where the female protagonist tries to uphold herself. An upper class petite girl faces the hardship she never expects. There is where the icing of the story also lies (Renée Zellweger). For all the depth, it finishes beautifully.Hence a 7.5 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,History
When movies like this don't succeed it is beautiful.,"When I first saw the trailors for this movie, I was overjoyed. Anthony Minghella is one of my favorite directors. His English Patient has always captured my imagination and moved me deeply. The actors in this movie were some of my favorite. Jude Law and especially Nicole Kidman, whose last year's performance in The Hours shocked me with her undertone of power. And with a cast of amazing supporting actors, including the likes of Phillip Seymor Hoffman and Giovanni Rabissi. How could anyone not love this movie? Simple, it was sold to you. You were not expected to buy it or believe. It was a bad soap opera on wheels rolling into a ravine. True, this movie had its moments. But that is all it had moments of average filming that swept you away for a second. Yet, you were brought back quickly by the stereotypes of the film.

But I must say, I was highly impressed with Renee Zellweger's contribution to the dramatic scale of the film.

Other than that, the pace was just right.Renee Zellweger's performance as Ruby steals every scene she is in.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Worth Watching,"This is a good but not excellent film. To begin, at 152 minutes, the film is too long. I could have easily cut out 30 minutes of the film with none the wiser. Nicole Kidman and Jude Law do well with their scripts, but are they too old for their parts? I haven't read the book ""Cold Mountain"" so maybe their characters are suppposed to be in their thirties. I have no problem if the characters are supposed to be in their thirties, but it would have been interesting if this had brought out more in the film as people used to get married much younger.Further, I think parts showing Ada messing up domestic chores should have been included, a bit like Scarlett O'Hara in ""Gone with the Wind"". Ada Monroe mentions her naivity in farm and house work, but adding some humorous learning experiences for Ada to a somewhat sad film could have added more realism to her transition from fair haired maiden to skilled markswoman.Also, I'm not a prude, but the sex scene between Ada and Inman in my opinion is softly p*rnographic and unnecessary. I think more awkwardness would have occurred between Ada and Inman for their first time yet Ada appears to be a skilled and unhibited lover. I think less should have been shown and more imagined by the audience.Renee Zellweger is excellent as Ruby and most believable as her character. Lesser known actor Brendon Gleeson as Ruby's father also does a fantastic job in his role.The film's cinematography is excellent and the scenery gorgeous. Overall, a good film worth watching, but it could use some improvements.",7.0,Anonymous,History
This is why movies are made. Tops my list of 2003.,"`Cold Mountain' may perhaps be the best picture of 2003. In a year of such feats as `The Station Agent' and `The Human Stain'. I think I am coming to realize, that the Civil War epic love story (sounds like it's been done before, doesn't it?) stands in a high place, maybe above those other first two.You see, `Cold Mountain' is the type of movie that is rather hard to review, as there are aspects of the film and plot that one can't allude to without something being given away; with that I say, if you are an avid movie fan, and think you may want to see this film in any (even small) way, go see this art and experience it for yourself. Each performance in this movie fits into the larger puzzle in pieces, with supporting performers such as Natalie Portman or Donald Sutherland or Philip Seymour Hoffman playing their parts with a certain flawless, true and often brutal, beauty. And so it goes for the leads-each is simply spellbinding. I believe Nicole Kidman to be one of our time's greatest actors, and as Ada, one part of the epic (though unconventional) love story, gives a phenomenal performance; capturing an inexperienced character in love and life in the beginning pieces of the film, and taking that character on an amazing, harsh journey into real life and romance in the face of such terror, through the film's remainder. And Jude Law; I did not know he had this in him. I'd seen very good performances from him in `Road to Perdition' and even `The Talented Mr. Ripley', but as Ada's lover Inman, he blew me away. His accent, look, body language were all perfectly woven together in his character. As is also the case with Renee Zellwegger; of course, given the uneducated attitude one might attribute to a stereotypical `hillbilly' type of her character, it is not hard to see how some would think her performance strictly comic relief. But Ruby, her character, is so much more than all that. She's funny, she's honest, and she feels; she's human. A beauty character-in a beautiful ensemble.On to the story, which has been called `uneven' by some, for reasons which include every thing to its only having one graphic strictly battle scene in the film's opening (one extremely powerful piece of cinema that effected me in a way I'm not sure I've been touched before) to Inman and Ada's relationship before the war being to brief, to the fact that Inman is a deserter, low-life, traitor of his cause. If you watch `Cold Mountain', and still think that, then I do not know what to tell you. Yes, it is about a deserter; a man who leaves the war he's fighting what is his life's love, for he yearns for life beyond the death of war and no longer wants to support anything such as the brutal ugliness of the Civil War. That is what the whole movie is about, love and life, and the pointlessness of fighting in the extreme ways of war. The story is about the people-not strictly the battle fought on the field, but of the ones fought in the soul-their love, their simplicity, their depth, their comic moments, their tragic moments; as the moments of their lives.No other film this year has captured me into the state of emotional involvement, also. Though the film is something close to two and a half hours, to me it seemed nothing like the time. It did not seem short, but it was in no way `long'. It was a perfect piece of time during which I experienced some great, involving art. And while you have to see the film to understand the type of love story it is, I can tell you the love story had me entirely swept away (unlike Minghella's other major work ""The English Patient"". The final hour of the film had me, and then, I knew this was a feat of cinematic achievement regardless of the ending, and I let the film take me entirely.The result was quite possibly one of the greatest movies I've ever seen.I highly recommend you go see `Cold Mountain'. A standing ovation from me for director Anthony Minghella, leads Nicole Kidman, Jude Law, and Renee Zellwegger; and all those involved.  Avery large, enthusiastic thumbs up.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Renee Zellweger, Jude Law, and Nicole Kidman all give outstanding performances in the best period film of the year!  I am so pleases renee won BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS at the oscars. Even though this film got snubbed for best picture, best director, best actress, best makeup, best costume design, and best cinematography, IT IS STILL MY SECOND PICK FOR THE BEST PICTURE OF THE YEAR! (return of the king was my #1). This films message is probably the most important of any other film this year: Find your way home...no matter what the cost.  THIS IS BY FAR THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MOVIE OF THE YEAR and I loved every inch of it. It's a full-blown **** masterpiece.

A solid tale of love and survival with some questionable casting choices.,"Based on a book by Charles Frazier and adapted for the screen by Anthony Minghella, Cold Mountain is a broad, ambitious love story set against a backdrop of the American civil war (1861–1865). It has a cast that you imagine being assembled at Cannes, as almost every character we encounter on the journey (all 148mins of it) is instantly recognisable, and therein lies my beef. For any period piece brimming with big names, there's an inherent distraction from the material when each time we're introduced to a new Hollywood star. I found myself holding my breath as to whether he or she had the ability to adapt to the landscape of the time with an authentic southern accent. What's worse is when my fears are realised and actors like Ray Winstone, Jude Law and Nicole Kidman allow their accents to slip resulting in a character/audience detatchment that need never have been there. I understand the box office benefits to having star names dotted all over your poster, but in this case, a few more indigenous folks wouldn't have gone amiss. Casting issues aside, the film looks beautiful. Clearly, this is an ambitious piece and fittingly the cinematography is epic and sprawling. There's striking visual metaphors too. Apart from in the opening scenes, we see very little of the actual conflicts, although what we do see is brutal and bloody. Instead of witnessing soldiers dying, we see the crops on the farms and the unattended fields going to waste amid the absence of farmers to tend to them. It's symbolic of a country that was tearing itself apart from the inside. Essentially though, this is personal love story, but within that it's also a survival tale and the film stands and falls on buying into that love. I'm pleased to say that i felt it worked. Casting issues aside, such is the weight of what's happening in the background coupled with the obstacles our couple have to overcome to try to be together, that it's hard to deny some sort of emotional investment. That said, the initial set-up of the relationship, crucial to understanding and believing in the central love, could have been more played upon. Nicole Kidman is a fine actress yet here she lacks a sense of warmth. The times she shares the screen with a lively Renée Zellweger, she almost fades into the scenery. Additionally, Natalie Portman, in a brief role, brings real humanity and weight to proceedings leaving Kidman, the main star playing very much third fiddle. I'd have to say that although Cold Mountain is long and flawed, the backdrop events really help carry the film through some odd casting choices to help it become a good, but not great story of love's efforts to overcome the seemingly insurmountable. 3/5",7.0,Anonymous,History
Why I thought Cold Mountain was just plain bad.,"I could forgive the fact that the movie was shot in Romania (the time and place are a crucial part of the novel full of character and qualified film staff, but remained an untapped resource for the movie).  I could forgive that foreign actors were used as leads, presumably for their names, while there are perfectly qualified American, or better yet southern actors available (there was an Australian, an Englishman, a couple Irishmen, and a whole bunch of Romanians; Oh and one great young southern actor, Ethan Suplee with a relatively inconsequential part.).  I could forgive the geographical mistakes (if you are in Petersburg, VA start walking south or west or better yet uphill and you will get to Avery County, NC, but you will never see the ocean).  I could forgive the lack of true development of a villain or evil (several were suggested, the weakest of which was there for the finale).  I could forgive Phillip Seymore Hoffman's British southern fusion accent (Not nearly as bad as Nichole Kidman's or Jude Law's sad attempts at southerners...sad and inconsistent), or Rene Zellweger's comic book interpretation of her comic relief character (she was occasionally amusing after all).  I could forgive the soundtrack for leading me by the nose though every pivotal scene like some kind of emotional laugh track (not the bluegrass, the bluegrass was great).  I could forgive Natalie Portman for anything (because she is supremely attractive).  I could forgive a lot of things, but I'm not gonna.  It was just bad.  The acting. The interpretation of the story.  Character development.  The sexual tension. The release of said tension.  This is Hollywood hubris at it's best.  To be fair everyone worked very hard, and with a different script and a different director this cast could have made one of the greatest movies ever (I have a deep respect for so many actors involved in this movie), and Cold Mountain is a nice vehicle (most of the nice parts of the movie were where Minghella left the book alone), but it just didn't happen.  Donald Sutherland was very good along with James Gammon and Giovanni Ribisi.  Romania was pretty. Cold Mountain however, was just plain bad.",1.0,Anonymous,History
The Odyssey of the Civil War?,"""Cold Mountain"" (2003) tries to be The Odyssey told during the Civil War - the story of a man on his way home to his eternal love and all the obstacles and tribulations he faces. There a lot to admire in CM - Anthony Minghella sure knows how to make a good-looking film with great views and impressive cinematography. This and his previous films, ""The English Patient"" and ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" are the good examples of his craft. The war scene in the beginning of the film is powerful and violent but I could not help thinking of the opening scene of 'Saving Private Ryan' which had set the standards for all following war films for shooting the super violent and realistic combat scenes. I did not read the book, so I can not comment on what parts were left out but the love story between Inman (Law) and Ada (Kidman) did not touch me very much. I am not sure if it has to do with the story itself or with the performances of two main characters but they were overshadowed by the supporting characters played by Eileen Atkins, Brendan Gleeson, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Natalie Portman, Kathy Baker, and Giovanni Ribisi. Some of them had only few minutes of screen time but their characters are interesting and alive. Renee Zellweger received all possible awards last year for her turn as Ruby, funny looking but strong, energetic and independent woman who had helped the helpless and lonely Ada to manage her farm after her father died. I liked the character but I was not too impressed by Zellweger's performance. I think she had overplayed and made Ruby too grotesque. I've seen four Oscar nominated performances from last year and at least two were much better than Renee Zellweger.There is a very frank love scene between Law and Kidman in the end. It is the well made scene but too beautiful considering that two lovers went through the nightmares of war, starvation, disease, and the lack of any decent conditions. I saw on the screen two very attractive people in great shape with sexy bodies, well tanned and toned in the trendy gyms not two lovers of Cold Mountain during the devastating war. 6/10",,Anonymous,History
Cold Mountain,"Inman is a laborer living in Cold Mountain, North Carolina. He is a quiet man, content with his life of solitude. When Ada and her minister father move into Cold Mountain, he is instantly smitten. Ada is immediately attracted to Innman as well, and after only a few meetings they have fallen madly in love with each other.But they never get a chance to form a real relationship, because Inman is soon sent off to fight in the Civil War.Inman is gone for several years, and Ada continues to hope for his return and send him letters. While in a hospital bed, Inman receives a letter from Ada; ""If you are fighting,"" it reads, ""quit fighting. If you are marching, quit marching. Come back to me.""And Inman does - he gets out of his bed, and sneaks away in the night, heading back to Cold Mountain. He treks through the wilderness, avoiding the army (he is a deserter, after all) and running into several interesting characters, including an adulterous preacher and a widowed mother. Ada, meanwhile, is having trouble maintaining the farm after the death of her father.So Ruby Thewes, a strong-willed southern woman, is sent to help out. Upon arriving, the first thing Ruby does (other than berate Ada), is rip the head off of a troublesome rooster. Soon, the farm is nearing its former glory. But not all is well. The head of the local ""home guards"" has his eye on Ada and her land.Things continue to get worse when Ruby's father, another deserter, and his band of musicians (including a surprisingly good Jack White, of the ""White Stripes"") show up for a visit. Everything soon falls apart, but soon things begin to look good for Ada. With Inman on his journey home, with Ada tending to her land, at times things will look dim.The acting in the film is superb. Notably Renee. She received an Oscar, and rightfully so. Jude Law's performance is also Oscar worthy. Kidman's how ever is nothing special, as usual. Cold Mountain has ""epic"" written all over it. Although, I didn't get that feeling with it. It is a good movie. Don't get me wrong. I didn't want to see it. (Long story).What makes the film fall short of perfection is that it at times drifts away from Inmans quest. Making it confusing, and sometimes annoying. It looses focus quickly on Inman's quest, his journey home and that hurts the film. It relies too much on supporting characters. By supporting I mean characters that last no more than 5-10 minutes. No importance really to a good portion of them.***1/2/*****",7.0,Anonymous,History
the courage to live,"Love is a long waiting period, like a flight over mountains. In the dim light, even undressing becomes art. In fact, the emotional foundation of Inman and Ada is not reliable. Even Inman himself said, ""I don't even know her"", but only the first few memories are replayed in his mind countless times and strengthened into an indestructible fortress, even becoming the courage to live. I have to say that this is the best embodiment of loftiness in the air of great love! Perhaps, it is because the real life is really too dark, so light is also hope. Because of you, I am afraid to die.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Just one problem,"This is a really well executed film. There are some scenes that are absolutely just perfect, like the main war sequence. I think it is beautifully filmed and the story is OK but the characters make it. I particularly like the smaller characters as played by Brendan Gleeson, Renee Zellweger and Philip Seymour Hoffman is, as always, amazing. The two female leads are actors that annoy me as much as they impress me but have most definitely impressed this time around. The one problem I speak of is Jude Law. There are any number of great actors that could have played the part and they wouldn't have even had to fake an accent. By no measure does he ruin the film and actually does a good job through most of the film. It's when he and the Nicole Kidman character aren't going at it that the relationship is farcical. Their debates as to whether they are behaving appropriately as a couple and their attempts to outdo one another in the ""most poetic expression of love"" competition were unnecessary.The casting was great but almost unnecessary. As was the marketing ploy of the bit part player Jack White, who performs the musical parts well but acts badly. Other personnel include Cillian Murphy, Natalie Portman and Giovanni Ribisi who do really well but, again in bit parts. Ray Winstone is unrecognisable as ""the baddie"" and plays the part really well. Charlie Hunnam is someone I'd never heard of before but I'll be keeping an eye on, pure evil.Overall a very good watch and good value for money with over 2 1/2 hours entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Cold Mountain tells a story happened during American Civil War:,"Cold Mountain tells a story happened during American Civil War: Young Inman(Jude Law) fell in love with beautiful Ada(Nicole Kidman) in a place called Cold Mountain. But Inman decided to leave and fight with the Confederate Army when the civil war broke out. As the years pass, Ada struggles on her deceased father's farm with Ruby (Renne Zellweger), a doughty girl who assisted Ada along way, they had to work extremely hard to survive from the harsh environment and protect themselves from the Home Guards bullies who left behind the war. Meanwhile injured Inman received a letter from Ada and he realized that he had enough pointless slaughter, so he tried to go back to his spiritual land- Cold Mountain and beloved Ada. Inman had to walk through the dangerous and unstable south, cross the mountains without let the pursuing Union Army find him. On the way of his unforgettable and perilous odyssey, he met a lone line of interesting people who suffered from the war in different ways. When finally Inman arrived to Cold Mountain and married Ada, an irreparable tragedy happened: Inman lost his life during a conflict with the Home Guards, but Ada faced her miserable future bravely with her friends. The movie clearly expressed its theme- the ruthlessness of the brutal war by showing audience two different parts' stories: the journey of Inman and Ada's hard life back in Cold Mountain. Examples: On the way home, Inman suffered from starvation, injuries and frustration; Back in Cold Mountain, Ada the genteel intellectual had to face the real world on her own for the very first time, all she could do was to create the refuge herself or to die. The story contains some interesting characters that have distinctive personalities. E.g. a beautiful and well educated young lady was forced to run a farm, something she knows absolutely nothing, she was waiting to die in the beginning, was fortunately saved scrappy Ruby. And then she turns 180 and shown great determination to survive. There are some people like Ada in the real life: could be very depressive in a special moment, but when once activated by someone or something, they could change the way of attitude and do really well. Obviously, Ada's special personality made the story more interesting and extend-able; the next good example should be Ruby, she has a resisting personality, it shown by her dialogs like ""oh, I am better than any men!"" and actress' great performance like her complex emotion when found her father has been shot. So Ruby was also an important role of connecting and extending stories. The movie used some remarkable techniques such as the repeating of flashback in the beginning, it shows the huge difference between the life in Cold Mountain and the life that Inman is having in the war. It worked with actor's incredible performance to made audience feel stronger of character's situation and created a sense of horror which could immediately draw audience' attention to the film. It also symbols how serious the movie is; cross cutting has been largely used through out the movie, it created the special structure of the film: starts with flash back, and then tells two different parts of story at the same time by kept cutting forth and back. The director used this structure was probably it deferred to the original form the story: the novel Cold Mountain by Charles Frazier. And it also successfully reinforced the meaning of the movie: on both side, they were all suffering but not giving up.There were also some impressive scenes in the movie: Scene one: when Ruby's father realized that Home Guards were came to kill them, he chose to play and sing a real nice song and hopes to soften their hearts. The pace of the scene was so slow in the beginning but was sudden turns to fast when the singing plan fails- they shot two members of the band. After that, the pace slowed right down and long still shots were used again to emphasis the death. it made the scene so shocking! Scene two: In the last part, whole ""family"" was sitting around the table, they were the survivors and everything seemed great. But from their faces, audiences could easily tell that none of them is happy, because they've all lost something from the war, things those will never come back. It once again strongly reinforced the powerful meaning of the movie and highlighted the main theme: ruthlessness of the war.Over all, I think it is a great movie and I really enjoyed watching it. Excellent acting performance, vivid personalities of characters, refined camera shots all linked by a nice storyline. The only regret I left was the pace of whole movie; it seemed a bit too slow to tell such a story. But anyway, this is good movie to watch.

excellent adaptation of a superior novel,"""How can a name, not even a real name, break your heart?"" Here's how. There have been few film versions of a celebrated novel that have done better justice to their source material than Anthony Minghella's movie of Charles Frazier's Cold Mountain.

I personally cried numerous times while reading the novel and spent much of the evening watching the film through tears.Astounding scope, beautiful words, great acting and great music.

Weinstein-Miramax Bulldozer Can't Scam This Viewer,"Critics are falling over themselves within the Weinstein's Sphere of Influence to praise this ugly, misguided and repellent adaptation of the lyrical novel on which it's based.  Minghella's ham-fisted direction of the egregiously gory and shrill overly-episodic odyssey is one of the many missteps of this ""civil-war love story"".  Are they kidding?  After Ms. Kidman and Mr. Law meet cute with zero screen chemistry in a small North Carolina town and steal a kiss before its off to war for Jude and his photo souvenir of the girl he left behind, it's a two hour test to the kidneys as to whether he will survive a myriad of near-death experiences to reunite with his soulmate. Who cares?  Philip S. Hoffman's amateurish scene chewing in a disgusting and unfunny role pales to Renee Zelweger's appearance as a corn-fed dynamo who bursts miraculously upon the scene of Kidman's lonely farm to save the day.  Rarely has a performance screamed of ""look at me, I'm acting"" smugness.  Her sheer deafening nerve wakes up the longuers for a couple of minutes until the bluster wears painfully thin.  Released by Miramax strategically for Oscar and Golden Globe (what a farce) consideration, the Weinsteins apparently own, along with Dick Clark, the critical community and won 8 Globe nominations for their overblown failure. The resultant crime is that awards have become meaningless and small, less powerful PR-driven films become obscure.  Cold Mountain is a concept film and an empty, bitter waste of time.

Miramax strikes again,"This is yet another vacuous, overlong, prettified Miramax adaptation of a semi-literary novel.

Great battle scenes,"As with the French weeper, A LONG ENGAGEMENT, COLD MOUNTAIN is a war film within a romantic film, a chick flick with some pretty awesome battle scenes and satisfyingly bloody violence. Jude Law plays a southern farmhand who goes off to fight the Civil War, vowing to return to his true love, the aristocratic Nicole Kidman, who has recently moved with her ailing father (a bewigged Donald Sutherland) from the big city to the hills of North Carolina. While Nicole is waiting for Law to come home, she undergoes various trials and tribulations, as does Law. An almost unrecognizable Renee Zellweger plays Kidman's spunky right-hand woman, and Natalie Portman is a woman with child and no husband whom Law befriends on his arduous journey home. Jena Malone, Charlie Hunnam, Kathy Baker, Philip S. Hoffman, Ray Winstone, Cillian Murphy, Brendan Gleeson and Giovanni Ribisi play supporting roles. With all this star power, especially all the foreigners, I half-expected Keira Knightley to pop in. The thick southern accents are something to hear, if not always understand, and the many fight scenes are worth a look by all you unreconstructed males out there. I could have done without all the romantic folderol, but you can't have everything. Zellweger gives an Oscar-worthy performance.

"Minghella's love story set in another gritty war plays well enough, unfortunately the romantic plot is the least interesting element of the picture","Watching ""Cold Mountain"" gave me the impression that its director, Anthony Minghella, was deliberately trying to outdo himself and the own film of his' that he was trying to beat was the virtually impeccable ""The English Patient"" from 1996. Comparing the two movies, the premise is quite similar. We have a passionate love affair between two people set in a turbulent time of war and they end up treating the war more or less as a disturbance in the background while trying to find themselves back in each other's arms again. The primary plot differences are that Nicole Kidman's character is not married, Jude Law's is a deserter, and the conflict is the American Civil War.""Cold Mountain"" is, story-wise, more watered down and mellow than say ""The English Patient"" and it's more on the level for people who want a simple love story with some kind of an exterior turbulence causing a problem. It is a shorter film, which is a plus for people with less patience. However, it's not as spectacular or original or genuinely gripping as ""The English Patient."" My *only* big complaint about ""Cold Mountain"" is, astonishingly, the love affair between the characters of Inman (Jude Law) and Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman). Amazingly, their love was the least interesting thing in the picture. They don't have a real relationship; we don't feel any real passion coming from them and the passion that we do see is more physical than emotional. I was more fascinated by the friendship between Nicole Kidman and Oscar-winner Renee Zellwegger and also Jude Law's travels across country dodging vigilantes and enemy soldiers. If Minghella had strengthened the importance of the love story, then he would have had, I feel, a better picture.Of course, the movie is entertaining even if the love story is uninteresting. The Civil War sequences are absolutely great; they are of the modern tradition that show war as horrible and dehumanizing. The re-enactment of the Petersburg campaign, in which tons of explosives was detonated from underground and then followed by a hand-to-hand battle is horrifying. Minghella does not shy from showing blood and gore in an artistic and sensible manner, and he's not afraid to show casualties of innocence and life in these scenes. There are moments where women as well as men are killed, oftentimes by crossfire. And there's more to it. Just the sound design of the movie generates tension. There's a scene where Inman and another deserter make themselves a meal by sawing off the head of a dead cow. We don't see the slicing, but the sound effects of blade going through bone are sickening.Lastly, I must congratulate the cast for the performances. Jude Law was terrific in the movie and deserved the Academy Award nomination he received. I feel that Nicole Kidman deserved one as well, even though her character was a bit shallow. Renee Zellwegger had the most personality and screen-stealing atmosphere. And then there's just the bit parts that also really work to complete this stylistic world recreating a horrible time in America's past.Maybe ""Cold Mountain"" would have been better as a war picture, but it most certainly would have been spectacular like ""The English Patient"" if its love story had been powered up and made more passionate by the screenwriters and director Anthony Minghella. As it is, it's a most enjoyable picture, I wasn't bored by it, and I recommend it. I just say that its love story - though a central plot point - is a little more mellow than it needs to be and all the stuff around it was what really worked.",7.0,Anonymous,History
One of those kinds of pictures practically budgeted to get Oscar nominations,"Anthony Minghella, responsible for such films as The English Patient (which I did not like despite the acclaim) and The Talented Mr. Ripley (which I liked), returns with another adaptation- Cold Mountain, which entails the romance-during-civil war scenario passed down by the Gone with the Wind movie gods. Jude Law and Nicole Kidman play two people, Inman and Ada, who've barely known each other before Law goes off to fight in the War, but they write (Kidman contributes voice-overs that more often than not don't work or aren't needed for the story) to one another, that is until he witnesses a terrible battle years later. He becomes a deserter, as he travels across wild parts of the South on her way back to her. During this time Ada's father dies, and she's all alone until a girl from the mountains who's also lost her father, Ruby (Renee Zellweger), comes down to help on the farm. It doesn't take this reviewer to tell where the story is headed, and that's probably how Minghella liked it set up (from Charles Frazier's book).There's much that I liked about Cold Mountain: the strong, period-perfect production design by Dante Ferretti, an entertaining battle sequence near the beginning, and an all-star cast that, though mostly supporting, does it's job well. And among the Oscar nominations the film is bound to receive (from my perspective this film follows in the tradition that Miramax puts out at least one film every year around this time to garner some space in the audience at the show), I'd say that Zellweger could perhaps get her's. What I didn't think was all that great about the movie, and what makes it over-rated, is that it's a story that makes itself too clear that this will happen now, and this will happen in the next scene, and in a few minutes we can expect this, and so on. The presence of confederate soldiers, always on the look out for traitors around Ada's region, makes it all too by-the-books, so to speak. A couple of minutes could've been chopped off as well. Is it a well made movie? yes, but maybe it's TOO well made for its own good.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A rare film where the movie is better if you've read the book ...,"Rarely is a movie improved by having read the book. Usually, whatever they do with the movie will be a disappointment if you loved the book. I love the book ""Cold Mountain"" and have read it at least 4 times. I think that it speaks to the horror of war, the wickedness of which the human species is capable, and the futility of the bloodshed better than any other book I've read.I think the movie captures those feelings very well indeed. I hope I am quoting this correctly (but I'm close, anyway) -- when Inman says that he is like any other fool ""going off to war with a lie and a flag"" ... well, yeah. A lie and a flag. That IS what war is, for the most part. The battle scenes at the beginning of the film, according to those who have been witness to real battles in war, are as good or better than any battle scenes ever filmed.The story is, of necessity, simplified for the purposes of the film and that's where it helped to have read the book. My husband and I were able to mentally fill in ""missing pieces."" I found that among my friends who saw the movie, those who did not first read the book thought it was okay, but didn't love it, whereas those of us who had first read the book, really LOVED the movie.I also felt the casting was exceptional and that Renee Zellweger well deserved her Oscar. When I realized that she had been cast as Ruby, I was highly dubious ... but she made it work. Jude Law, who is not usually cast as a leading man, gives a super performance, for which he has received surprisingly little recognition.Finally, if you love classic ""old timey"" country music, the score for this film is beautiful. As is the cinematography.This is not an upbeat movie, but it wasn't an upbeat book, either. The adaptation is deeply faithful to the author's intent.

The film's soundtrack may be my favorite part of the whole production! I was unfamiliar with the Appalachian music style and I have come to really love the simplicity of a fiddle and banjo pairing.

Renee' Zellweiger added some great moments to this movie, the character added humour & contrast-her relationship with Kidman was very, very strong and quite touching.

You really believe in the passion this couple has for if not each other for the idea of it when the their world is falling apart. The scene Jude Law has with Eileen Atkins is incredibly moving and deeply felt. Renee Zellweger is great in the role of Ruby. She is both hilarious and heartbreaking. Any scene with Sally is extremely well done. Kidman also gives an excellent perforamnce. She really inhabits the character and here ""there will be a reckoning"" kine is nailed. Cold Mountain has the best gun fight probably since High Noon. The action in the movie is consistently raw and shocking. The most underrated movie of the 2000's.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Surprising and beautiful,"First, it is surprising that very little of the film is shot in North Carolina - and that the majority of it is actually filmed in the country of Romania! Having been to 'the real' Cold Mountain many times, one can see the similarities though. The landscape around the mountain is filled with the same type hillsides and hollers we see in the film.And honestly, even in 1860's character, Nicole Kidman has never looked more beautiful. She is very much like a porcelain doll come to life, and the perfect choice for this film - cause she nails this helpless yet proud character of Ada, her performance is virtually flawless. And even though Renee Zellwegger's character is a little irritating, but her performance is brilliant. The rest of the cast is well chosen and most acceptably fill their roles. Watch for Giovanni Ribisi and Kathy Baker, they are especially good. Ribisi brings his trademark 'weirdness' to a despicable character, and Baker is amazingly 'motherly'...The most upsetting thing about the film is the realistic and historically accurate portrayal of the disgustingly rancid 'home guard' - who in real life simply took advantage of the war (as an opportunity) to terrorize the countryside, humiliate or routinely murder personal enemies, and line their own pockets with impunity. As if the war wasn't bad enough, southern towns and communities had to endure it with this accompanying evil in the form of men purported to be patriotic to the cause - when all they were (were) violent criminals who deserved to die.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Beautiful,"I do not know the novel. So, the admiration for the work of Anthony Mingella is high. Not only for the option for Romania for few scenes, but for a seductive, admirable film, an inspired love story and a moving war story. All is fascinating in the case of Cold Mountain. The outdoors, the performances for each character,, the humor and, sure, especially, Renee Zellweger. Short, a beautiful film. And little more because it escapes from the cage of sentimentalism, using a sentimental story for a large and precise perspective about a special world.",,Anonymous,History
Brilliant but boring,"The acting, script, and cinematography is superb. However, it is the longest 2.5 hour movie I have yawned through in a long time. Saving Private Ryan sets the bar for a battle sequence and I was thoroughly unimpressed with the PG-rated opening battle scene at Petersburg. Other elements of the movie firmly plant this movie in the R-rated arena and they certainly could have made the battle scene more realistic. Maybe this set me off for the rest of the movie. I was just waiting to see how it ended. There are two scenes (one is the Siren' scene) that are not family-friendly and should be fast forwarded by anyone who trusts what is written in Matthew 6. Even the behind the scenes featurette was slow (Minghella, have some coffee!). If you like a wonderful story, great acting and brilliant cinematography, you'll like this movie. If you like fast paced entertainment you may not. 7 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Love, War, and an Unforgettable Journey""","I was on the hunt for Civil War movies, and this one popped up at the top of the list, along with Gettysburg (which is 4 hours long-that's for another day). But wow, how did I miss this gem?The opening scene is absolutely stunning, setting the tone for a beautiful yet harrowing journey of one man making his way back to his love one. It's a perfect blend of war, love, and then some more love and war. Philip Seymour Hoffman, as always, was delight to see that left me feeling bittersweet. Jack White, surprisingly, brought a touch of humor that made me laugh.Overall, this is a wonderful film that I highly recommend.

I'll bet Charles Frazier has to be as pleased with the translation of his extraordinary work ...,"A brilliant film.   The book was fresh, original and `tight' as stories go. On film, it's the best love story since West Side Story.  There's plenty of killin' and explosions to keep the story moving for the guys.  If Minghella decides to release a 3 hour director's cut, I will buy a copy.  Seinfeld had fewer eccentric characters than this gem.  I did not want it to end.  And then it did  brilliantly again.Every actor hit their marks.  Kidman has been exceptional for years Jude Law finds his talent here.  Both will get nominations.  Supporting: Zellweger, Portman and Hoffman are brilliant  Brilliant!  especially Zellweger and Hoffman.  Renee's worth the price of admission all by her lonesome.Cold Mountain is a beautiful place to be.  True love is a beautiful thing to have.   Against the backdrop of war's horror  the brief life spans of the day  the inability of mail getting through, forcing those starving for a lover's words to cling to a single sentence, or a memory when words are unavailable  . . . these are things to be treasured.   Only those with dry-ice frosting in their veins can't see it.Favorite parts:  That the characters think / speak like they would in the era (as I imagine it anyway).   1860s South.  Zellweger and Hoffman are best in supporting roles.  The war is portrayed as realistically as I've ever seen it.  The war photography is gritty  real  the war action is painful and morally split - like a bayonet to the gut.   Remedies to repair damaged flesh are fresh out of Granny Clampett's doctorin' bag.  Dirty fingernails: the standard of the day.   I'll bet Charles Frazier is as pleased with the translation as I am.  10 / 10.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"A sweeping, ravishing film.","I don't understand the criticism that COLD MOUNTAIN is getting. It is a heartfelt, lavish epic with an unabashedly romantic and beautiful heart. And, just as in small-scale and independent dramas, the characters are always the most important thing.Jude Law is excellent as Inman, a wounded soldier who drops everything to journey back to the woman he fell in love with. Despite what others say, Nicole Kidman is absolutely wonderful as Ada Monroe. Her transformation from delicate Southern belle to strong survivor is notably strong.Renee Zellweger steals the film with her plucky and sassy Ruby Thewes. Zellweger avoids cliche by showing commitment and giving her character real emotion... thus making the audience fall in love with her.Natalie Portman is also great as a young, suffering mother named Sara. Portman is so good in this, that I actually forgave her for those garbage STAR WARS flicks.Anthony Minghella (whose TALENTED MR. RIPLEY was one of the best films of 1999) once again gives his keen eye, tight writing skills, and literary sensibility to a near-flawless masterpiece, and I think it is disturbing that his work was blatantly ignored by the Academy.Don't fight it, don't look for things to nitpick about.

"""Cold Mountain"" - A Technical Review","Adapted from the Charles Frazier novel, and a poignant study of love prevailing over distance, time, and war, Cold Mountain (2003 Miramax Films) tears a romance asunder by means of the Civil War.Reverend Monroe (Donald Sutherland) and his beautiful and loving daughter Ada (Nicole Kidman) move from Charlotte to the community of Cold Mountain, North Carolina just before the War Between the States. Ada subsequently meets and falls in love with Inman (Jude Law), a local laborer and soon-to-be Confederate soldier. Inman is sent to the front lines as his relationship with Ada is only beginning, and, soon after their relocation, Reverend Monroe passes away, leaving Ada to care for herself. Much to the dismay of her neighbors, Ada is unable to take care of both herself and the Monroe's property. When it seems as if the situation could not worsen, Ruby Thewes (Renée Zellweger) arrives and restores the Monroe estate and Ada. Inman meanwhile escapes from a military hospital, deserting his country and its cause, to return to Ada, to whom he has been writing and from whom he has been receiving letters. The movie relates Inman's journey home and also chronicles the difficulties that both Ada and Cold Mountain experience in the absence of all of its able-bodied men.Virtually every aspect of Cold Mountain is effective in contributing to the movie's success as a whole. Casting is excellent. Each actor fits his or her role quite well  there are very few times in the movie that the audience is reminded that this is a production by professional storytellers. Scenery is unquestionably one of Cold Mountain's fortes; sweeping panoramic shots of picturesque landscapes characterize the movie's cinematographic establishment of setting. Along the same lines, the movie's setting (both time and location) compliments the central theme of romance exceptionally. Cold Mountain's use of Civil War-era Appalachia for a backdrop plays on the nostalgia of the audience perfectly. The tempo of the movie is another of its strengths. At no point is the viewer bored  constant plot twists abound and new characters appear often, yet the observer commands a comprehensive understanding of the tale at all times. To top it off, Cold Mountain successfully utilizes an oft-ignored component of cinema: music. The musical score does its job modestly, enhancing the different elements of the film, but it rises to the task when called upon.First-rate casting, outstanding cinematic work, and a plot that is both captivating and moving provide for an extraordinary movie. Cold Mountain relates a saga of romance and undying love while exploiting the historic sentiments of its viewers.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Quite likable, if somewhat hokey ""Gone with the wind""- wannabe","I really wasn't expecting a correct American history lesson here, so I found myself quite enjoying this long, romantic and sweeping civil war-backdrop southern tale. A very likable ""Gone with the wind""- wannabe, albeit somewhat hokey, as many strong, potently violent scenes clash with the old-fashioned western-dreamy clichés.And although crammed with big Hollywood stars who are all a guilty pleasure to watch... I can't help but feel that this would work ideally (again, as with a LOT of films) as a mini-series, as many of the characters just seem to cartoonishly jump in and out- Hoffman, Portman and so on... they just don't stick around long enough!6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",6.0,Anonymous,History
Struggles Real,"Watching Cold Mountain was one of the most refreshing and most enjoyable experiences I have had with a movie in a very long time. This movie came out in 2003 and definitely covers the history side. Even Though it is a movie on the Civil War, this movie should be for a mature audience. This is a well made film of an epic drama which captures the cruelty of war and goodness of human heart. The movie is based on the book that was written. Cold Mountain is an emotionally driven, historically-based movie with an amazing cast and plot. This movie is very entertaining and heartbreaking all at once, it is great. The whole plot of the movie is very well written and executed. The actors' performances were phenomenal. Renee Zellwegar really made the character Ruby one of my favorites. Ruby is a drifter who is a strong, caring and feisty country woman who could do anything and did not need a man to lean on while doing it. She was sent to Ada to help her get the farm back on its feet. Renee Zellwgar taught Nicole Kidman, who played Ada, to be a strong independent woman as well. Ada struggled to keep her farm intact, as she had never done anything herself. She struggled as all her loved ones were leaving her. Nicole Kidman's acting was incredible. Nicole Kidman compels as a spirited yet vulnerable soul who uncovers her own unexpected secrets to life while on her journey to love. The way she had perceived her heartache and the love that she had for and saved until she had seen Inman. Inman is played by Jude Law. He played a huge role in creating such a tender love story between Ada and Inman. Jude Law's character had only one goal and that was to get home to his love Ada, the world has other plans for him but he keeps pushing through his troubles. The journey of Inman trying to get back is long and hard, but with many little action packed scenes that you can't look away from. The sweeping cycle of Inman's homeward journey is deftly balanced by Ada's growing sense of herself and her connection to the natural world around the farm. Inman had other plans and he was ready to go when he wanted. Even though it seems like his world is crashing down, he never gives up, this is a great characteristic to have when it comes to living in that era. There never seems to be a break as there is always something going on. I can not imagine watching this movie with any other characters. Rennee Zellwagar, Nicole Kidman, and Jude Law really made this movie and brought the feelings to life. The action in this movie is enough from start to finish to keep you entertained, but it is a great love story. There's no shortage of bloody fight scenes and there is some nudity at the end, so be aware. The struggle that there was when living during the Civil War was really brought out to life and how those with power abused their standings. The federal raiders who hunt down the war deserters add another dimension to this film. As they take their power way too far and it stands in the way of this love story. The scenes are beautiful and very detailed. The thought that went into filming the scenes definitely paid off because it just adds to the struggle of life that was going on, not only during the war scenes but the home front as well. The scenes are intense at times that it was hard to turn away from, this makes the two and half hour movie feel like it was only about thirty minutes. The costumes in this movie play a great role in showing the struggle of the time and sets the perfect image of the year that this takes place. These kinds of stories make you appreciate what we got in this time even though we still try so hard to screw up. Showing that our American history has always been in a hurry to fight and kill. This film was not afraid to show the brutal, violent horror of the Civil War. It is hard to imagine those gentlemen having to suit up and leave their wifes and kids, and yet to take nothing from it. I one hundred percent recommend this movie, one of the best films I have seen. Cold Mountain is very captivating. This epic drama is definitely worth rewatching. I am a big fan of war movies, love stories, and history, so this is a very well sought out movie that does a great job bringing all three of these into a movie. After reading the book, Cold Mountain, this movie was a perfect way to bring Frazier's ideas to life. Cold Mountain reaches deep into the reader's mind and heart. Frazier's way of wording his work invites participation into his thoughts. I was not reading the book, I experienced the book. I felt this way when I was watching the movie, I felt as though I was right in those scenes and I was part of the movie. The movie is based on the famous book under the same name. In general, the movie represents the events from the book with great degree of accuracy. Despite the fact that there are some small changes, the main events and the story lines from the book are represented in the movie. The book makes the perfect epic, which describes the period of the late Civil War. The movie depicts events from different perspectives. The authors of the movie make an accent on the visual representation and show different perspectives of the same events. After I had read the book, I told myself, I had to watch the movie. This film, Cold Mountain was definitely worth the two and a half hours long. I absolutely loved this movie and everything in between, there was so much that was added to this movie that made it a top tear movie for me.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Epic Proportions without an Epic Script,"Many points given to some of the cast - Jude Law, Renée Zellweger and Natalie Portman.

The Ishtar of Civil War dramas,"This movie was so bad, I thought I was going to scream in the middle of it. It was all I could do to sit through it.  The beginning of the movie where they are at war was promising.  Only it smacked of ""Saving Private Ryan"" to me...or at least an attempt at it.  Only we don't care for these people. There was no build up to the characters.  The kid that dies I guess was suppose to make us cry...but for some reason it just irritated everyone.  Then we have to listen to line after line of sappy dialog that tried desperately to mimic ""Wuthering Heights"", which of course was also quoted in the movie.  Go figure.  There was nothing original about the movie at all, it was like sitting through the most mundane parts of every war movie ever made, with a little bit of humor thrown in to keep you hoping that it was going to get better.  Sadly it doesn't.  3 hours later, I leave the theater feeling cheated.  Anthony Menghilla should be shot for trying to duplicate the English Patient, which for it's time was a good movie, but now I wonder....should I rent it and make sure I wasn't just caught up in the HYPE???  Maybe I was, but I definitely wasn't caught up in the hype of this film.  I really went to the theater wanting to like this movie.  I am a die hard Nicole Kidman fan. Save your money, rent it on DVD and laugh through it, as I did.",1.0,Anonymous,History
As a romance it stutters but it is a fabulous story of war,"In the months before the civil war, Ada Monroe moves to Cold Mountain, North Carolina with her father and meets Inman briefly before he goes to war. They fall for each other in this brief period and she writes to him constantly.  Injured in a major attack he receives a letter from her that her father is dead and she needs him to return.  He steals away from the hospital despite risk of being shot as a deserter.  At Cold Mountain, Ada gets the help of Ruby Thewes to run her farm and try to get by without a man.The trailer had failed to grab me and the mixed reviews hadn't exactly got me rushing into my local cinema, however a wet and cold morning helped me decide that it was a better bet than the January sales!  The film opens well with a great battle sequence that leads to flashbacks to show how Ada and Inman's romance began.  At this point the film stutters because the brief interaction between the two was not strong enough to get me totally behind Inman's quest to return to her.  If the whole film had relied on this then it would have been a problem - however it manages to keep moving as a story of the impact of war rather than a love story.The two strands of this tale work well as separates and the film seems to know this and doesn't labour the romance too much during the body of the film, preferring instead to let the stories work in their own right. Towards the end the film relies heavily on the audience caring about Ada and Inman, however this just about manages to work because I cared about them as individuals even if their love was something that hadn't been made real to me.The cast risk mockery with them having to all do accents that don't come naturally to them.  Law is very strong and he holds the attention as our eyes on the story.  Kidman is very good but she doesn't physically change as her emotional change would require.  Zellweger was a bit full on for my tastes but her character does help liven up her side of the story. Sutherland is good and the support cast of characters met alone the road includes Winstone, Gleeson, Hoffman, Ribisi and Portman - each of who does more than simply make an `oh look it's ..' appearance.Overall this was not as strong as it could have been because the film can't manage to develop a convincing enough bond between Inman and Ada.  Without this parts of the story stutter but what works regardless is Inman's journey though a country torn apart by war and Ada's struggle of women of the time left behind by the men who went off to die.",,Anonymous,History

"""Having a thing, and the loss of it""","American cinema was once very much enamoured of the Civil War. The silent era produced the world's first blockbuster with Birth of a Nation. Then the classic era gave us its crowning achievement in Gone with the Wind. But since then Civil War pictures have been few and far between. That period has to some extent fallen out of favour as a cultural touchstone, and there has of course been widespread condemnation of the overt racism of the former movie and the general of-its-timeness of the latter. Now, with a more realistic approach towards the horrors of conflict and oddly enough a British rather than American production, we finally have another great Civil War epic for our times in Cold Mountain.Adapted from the popular novel by Charles Frazier, Cold Mountain is an epic that is made vast through its succinct storytelling. The background to the romance between Jude Law and Nicole Kidman is communicated to us with pure images and mere fragments of dialogue. The characters and where they came from is rarely stated overtly, and it seems more natural that way, as if we're watching life pass by before us. In keeping with this director Anthony Minghella (who also adapted the screenplay) often keeps his camera high and distant, although he's not afraid to put us right within the action at times, allowing the liveliness of a character's performance to push the camera away or their calmness to draw it in. His wide-open shots show off the landscape at its finest (Romania often standing in for North Carolina, but this doesn't matter; it looks wonderful), showing off the changeless beauty which surrounds the misery and bloodshed.The cast of Cold Mountain gives us some fine examples of non-American actors playing Americans, not that you would know for how well Nicole Kidman and Jude Law master the dialect. That lilting Southern States accent rarely sounds very serious to an outsider, but Jude Law manages to bring a strong dignity to the part of Inman. Irishman Brendan Gleeson is excellent as always, and his authentic fiddle-playing is a bonus. Best of the bona fide Americans is Renee Zellwegger. She's massively theatrical, but she gives us just the sort of larger-than-life supporting character the movie needs. She plays the role with life and likability, and she is deep and genuine when it's needed too.Cold Mountain is, above all things, a powerful romance. There's a sweeping, Odyssey feel to Inman's journey, and a burning idealism to the love story that some might regard as old-fashioned despite the movie's modern take upon warfare. And funnily enough those earlier movies – Birth of a Nation and Gone with the Wind – weren't overly romantic tales. Cold Mountain is, in a way, more achingly human; a beautiful picture, full of the balance between great evil and great kindness. It's a worthy and far less flawed successor to those Civil War epics of past generations, and it's a real shame it never got quite the reception it deserved.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Best supporting actress,"Renée Zellweger's entrance makes the film start for me, even before she utters her first sentence. Her line about the stupidity of wars, all started by them, comes naturally from the mouth of a person with a strong character like her - enough to make the principal of the romance change to a practical stance in life... Also, that sentence should be mandatory reading in high-schools, everywhere! (Expletives included...)She has already won a British award, and should win the Oscar in this category. IF there was justice on this world, which it ain't.For instance, it's impossible to give another prize to the beautiful Kathy Parker, whom lechers won't look twice at... shame on them!

It could have been better.,"Director/Screenwriter Anthony Minghella takes so much time showing gruesome battle sequences that the fragilelove story between Ada and Inman hardly has a chance to come to life during the first 45 minutes of the film. It's only after the appearance of Renee Zellwegger as the mountain woman Ruby Thewes that the picture becomes interesting. If nominated in the best supporting actress category, Zellwegger will be hard to beat this year. The film strives so hard to be epic in scope that the intimacy is often lost. ""Cold Mountain"" is a good film, but could have been a very good one had it been edited down to under two hours by chopping out much of the military violence.Nicole Kidman as Ada is not asked to do much. Jude Law as Inman has the more physical and challenging role and is outstanding. The supporting cast is also excellent.One of my friends loved the film.

"boring, meandering soap opera","Based on the best-selling novel by Charles Frazier, Anthony Minghella's `Cold Mountain' is, like his earlier snooze-fest, `The English Patient,' one of those highbrow historical romances that only a Motion Picture Academy member could love.  Jude Law and Nicole Kidman play Inman and Ada, two Southerners whose budding romance is cut short when he goes off to fight in the Civil War.  Though the two `lovers' barely know one another, she spends years pining away for him, while he, eventually, deserts the battlefield in order to get back to her.  When her minister father dies unexpectedly, Ada, who has hitherto led a very sheltered life, is forced to fend for herself on the land he left her.  Eventually joining her in that endeavor is a feisty young woman named Ruby, played with a whole host of annoying, self-conscious mannerisms by the usually reliable Renee Zellweger.In ambiance and plot, `Cold Mountain' feels an awful lot like a warmed over `Gone With the Wind,' right down to the Southern-belle-forced-to-demean-herself-to-survive scenario.   The difference is that the two main characters in `Cold Mountain' are completely uninteresting as people and thoroughly unconvincing as lovers.  In a film in which the driving force is supposed to be obsessive passion, it's odd that the romance is laid out in such lukewarm and sketchy terms.  It's hard to believe that a young man would risk execution for treason trying to get back to a woman he barely knows  and it's even harder for the audience to work up much personal stake in the outcome.   Ada is like a magnet drawing Inman to her, but, for the life of us, we can't figure out the attraction.  Law does reasonably well as a sort of anti-hero version of Odysseus, but Kidman fails to score as a charisma-challenged Penelope  or Scarlett O'Hara, if you prefer.Another problem with `Cold Mountain' is that it overdoses on Southern-fried cornpone and backwater moonshine.  Every time Inman or Ada turn a corner, they seem to be confronted by yet another `colorful' Southern character  be it a fornicating preacher, a clan of promiscuous hillbillies, a fiddler-playing, ne'er-do-well daddy, or even the over-the-top Ruby herself, whose way with a folksy aphorism, after some initial appeal, eventually ends up setting the teeth on edge.  The film is a strangely schizophrenic one in that, while the lead characters are underdeveloped to the point of blandness, the secondary characters are overdrawn to the point of buffoonery.  The film, after awhile, begins to resemble the casting call for an out-of-town revival of Tennessee Williams.There are a few good things about `Cold Mountain.'  It doesn't shy away from some of the more brutal aspects of war and it deals head-on with the struggles the Southerners had to undergo being on the losing side. Moreover, some of the vistas are attractive.  But, apart from a few effective moments, `Cold Mountain,' is little more than a boring, meandering, high-toned soap opera, just the kind of movie that makes Academy members sit up and take notice come nomination time (the film garnered seven nominations and one win  for Zellweger's performance).  The rest of us are more likely to just curl up and go to sleep instead.",,Anonymous,History
Real feelings,"Did you ever notice that most - or all - of the films telling us about courage and honor, and devotion , and kindness, are about the past? Or maybe these are coincidences.. This is a very good film, tragic and sad, about people with clear hearts and Can you believe in a woman who's waiting for someone she never knew well, met him only several times - but knew that something were between them that will never let her forget him - believe in her waiting for him for years? All the letters she wrote , they were for him and for herself , to help her hold on and to not lose faith. And can you believe in a man who tries to get to her to her for only one day, or maybe less, and the day which may never really come? And the way the story ended is the only one possible. Inman could kill the man who shot him in he end, even without talking to him ,and Ada could give up, find herself someone else or merely get insane, but they two have met - through the horror of war , despite people's meanness - they've met and had the happiest moments in their lives, those moments which never last forever.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Mixture of ugly and beautiful,"It was a mixture of very ugly and very beautiful.  The brutality was so disgusting, it was difficult to watch (at one point I wanted to walk out). Some scenery and certain scenes were beautiful. Mingella was successful in showing symbolism, hypocrisy, imorality, kindness, cruelty and reality. At times too long and boring though. Nicole Kidman looked too beautiful throughout the movie (even in scenes where she is suppose to be ragged working the fields and going through extreme hardships). I always thought she was attractive but never looked so good as in this movie. It was the only unrealistic thing, almost a distraction (fault of Mingella). This part did not give Nicole a chance to show a lot of range as she was this composed, proper lady. Jude was very good but Renee I loved (she was funny and not attractive at all).",7.0,Anonymous,History

Great bonus points from my girlfriend for that. I really don't mind, though. What guy doesn't love a good war flick, right? Additionally, however, this movie gives a guy a chance to look at emotions, very raw, and not feel like he's less of man because of it. Emotions, especially in their rawest state, are what make life worth living. And this movie allows that. And you can always plead that you just enjoy the blood and guts if you want to later...

An epic,"""Cold Mountain"" opens with a literal bang at the July 1864 Battle of the Crater, part of the Siege of Petersburg, telling the story of Jude Law's Confederate soldier Inman's desertion and quest to get home to his sweetheart Ada (Australia's own Nicole Kidman) in Cold Mountain, North Carolina. He is pursued by Confederate forces, runs into Union forces, and meets plenty of memorable characters along the way.It's an epic from start to finish, often bleak and violent, the scenery and cinematography as spectacular as the performances particularly from Law and Kidman, but also others - Renee Zellwegger, Donald Sutherland, Ray Winstone and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Natalie Portman, Charlie Hunnam and Jack White co-star, amongst others.A very enjoyable Civil War movie.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Good Movie: Variable Acting,"I watched Cold Mountain and the English Patient again this weekend. The former is a Civil War melodrama about Inman (Jude Law), a Confederate soldier who deserts the army to return to Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) a girl he barely knows. Both films were lovingly directed by Anthony Minghella who does an exceptional job. Although, Cold Mountain is very good it could have been a great movie with the right casting and less folksy, backwoods dialog.Romantic epics need a convincing heroine. The English Patient, had Kristin Scott Thomas who was perfectly cast as the smart, alluring and beautiful Katherine Clifton. The main problem with Cold Mountain is Ada who seems silly and dim-witted and lacks that quality would make you believe that Inman could become obsessed after one kiss. As an actress Kidman has a limited range, she usually plays stern-faced women who face adversity with stoicism. Kidman was also too old to play the ingénue and Law's love interest. The film needed a young actress who could play charming, warm and vulnerable. For someone who was supposedly enduring hardship and near starvation she seemed ridiculously well-fed and over-dressed. Kidman was so impeccably groomed that it looked like she had spent three hours getting made-up for each scene. Michele Pfieffer in her younger days could have played the part perfectly. Even Natalie Portman would have been an improvement.Renee Zelleweger was more appropriately attired but her animated performance chewed the scenery but maybe she was trying to compensate for Kidman. Jude Law was in his own silent movie in the Odysseus role, but played his part well. Ray Winstone was excellent as the London/Southern villain.During the Civil War, people were probably not very well educated by today's standards and maybe they did speak in monosyllables. However if you watch BBC adaptations of Dickens, Austen or Mrs. Gaskill everyone is articulate. Maybe this is unrealistic but it would improved my entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Well Done,"Whenever I see a movie based on I book I really like, I always expect the worse. Cold Mountain is a great exception. The Romanian scenery is perfect. The actors all give it their best. One problem...after months of hard labor on the farm, Nicole always appears like she just walked off a Cosmo cover shoot, I mean, come on, NOBODY looked that good coming off a hardscrabble North Carolina farm in 1864. But that's a small quibble...the movie is great The music really works well too. Another good credit for T Bone Burnett.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Superb & haunting. One for the collection...,"Having seen this film again on DVD I can say that I enjoyed the film even more than I did at the cinema. It is atmospheric, beautifully filmed (in a beautiful part of the world) and combines a war film with a love story, with other elements thrown in. It is also important in illustrating just how grim the American Civil War was, at the front or on the 'home front'. Although Rene Zellweger won the most acclaim, I actually think Jude Law steals the acting with his portrayal of a thoroughly honourable 'southern boy' soldier torn between his desire to do his duty to his state and his love (Nicole Kidman). Where light relief is needed the brilliant and versatile Philip Seymour Hoffman provides it as 'the Reverend', not to mention Brendan Gleeson as the musician father to Rene's character - though it is never over-done. On the darker side Ray Winstone and his extremely sinister albino side-kick (Charlie Hunnam) provide the menace. Together with a superb soundtrack I would rate this as a timeless classic to be enjoyed in DVD collections for many years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Nicole Kidman needs to lay off the Botox,"Her embalmed look was totally inappropriate for the role. Her face remained too white, hair too coifed, clothes etc. too clean (and well-fitting, especially her father's old hat and coat in the scene where Inman comes home) for any sense of accuracy. It would be one thing if the production had allowed all the other actors to remain clean and perfect, too, but she was the only one who didn't get messy. There was never even a smudge on her powdered cheek. Are we to believe she was the only person in the Civil War with a bathtub and a mirror? She certainly looked like the only one who used them. Tweezers, too; I mean, what's with those eyebrows? She looked absolutely mean!The love story was implausible. She only went over to the guy because someone told her that he had said he thought she was cute. So, she goes over to tease him, then flirts with him a couple more times, and suddenly this is a love on a par with Odysseus and Penelope? Please.I should have known better than to expect anything better from the man who brought us ""The English Patient.""

Garbage Hill,"Let's see... we'll put three big stars in an adapted screenplay from a best-selling romantic war novel.  Can't miss, right?Wrong.Anthony Minghella's script for ""Cold Mountain"" is completely unbelievable. Nicole Kidman's southern belle is just too glamorous for the Civil War (the South went through hard times and then LOST, remember?).  Jude Law is okay. But the worst performance easily is Renee Zellweger's.  She wasn't believable for 5 seconds as the mountain girl who helps Nicole.  Even the ever-reliable Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a preacher whose role is such a cliche in the film that I wanted to walk out of the theatre, I really did. The whole ""Marry Me, Marry Me"" thing that was shown in the theatrical trailer was so fake!  Aaargh!  It's too late to get my money back!The worst part is, Renee Zellweger is a very talented actress, but she is completely unconvincing here.  Yet she's the odds-on favorite for this year's Best Supporting Actress award.  If she wins, this will be the film she's remembered for!  Aaargh!  I truly hope this film gets the same ""shut out"" treatment that the awful ""Gangs of New York"" got last year.

I agree with the Oscars.I would have liked to see it just a tiny bit least fixated on the ugliest instincts of men when struck by the horrors of war.

There Are No Small Actors,"This is a great drama that contains many interesting elements of romance, struggle, and the human condition, that nicely combine into a satisfying plot but it is truly the actors (and mainly the supporting ones at that) that make this a film worth seeing. There are many striking performances from individuals who ofter go above and beyond their pre-established skill levels.  Indeed, it is not the actors telling the story but rather the characters themselves. The Stanislavski method was definitely in use and just as the actors had immersed themselves in the roles, we, the audience we're able to be fully immersed in the story. Of particular note (besides, of course, the incomparable Renee Zellweger, who is fantastic but won her Oscar based not only on this performance but that of the last three years of work!) are Natalie Portman, Giovanni Ribisi, Kathy Baker and Philip Seymour Hoffman, who all make the most of their brief, yet poignant, appearances in the film.  Each of these actors make their jobs seem effortless and all have an incredible way of getting at the soul of the piece and the heart of the audience. All in all, this is a fine drama and worth at least one look.  Be prepared to get lost in the story and inwardly applaud those who made its telling possible.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Love triumphs over any suffering,"Although I haven't read the book, it became obvious that the film's screenplay has origins from literature. Many novels, poems written on diverse languages have at their basis the topic of fighting and suffering for love. This is the essence of the film. The rest is detail. But these detail differentiate it from other films. The age, the natural surroundings, the supporting actors are also chosen carefully, distinguishing the film from the majority.It is the age of the Civil War. A wounded soldier begins his journey back home to Cold Mountain, North Carolina to reunite with his love. Their love is pure, idyllic. The whole journey is also fabulous, he gets in amazing situations encountering evil and good. Meanwhile his love meets her own problems at home in the lean and dire days of the war.The acting is very good. I won't comment it in detail, I am sure others did, anyway the names and nominations speak for themselves. The scenes filmed in Romania near Brasov are beautiful, although I'm sure there are differences between the Carpatians and the Appalacian Mountains. The costumes and make-ups are good, the filmmakers even manage to make the audience forget about the fact that Kidman and Zellweger are film stars.This is not the usual romance story. Violent sometimes naturalistic scenes are mixed with romantic scenes. There are people, loving romantic movies, who consider it too violent at some places, others consider it too romantic.

I normally don't write reviews for films...,"I had to write a review for this film after I saw it last night and read some of the comments of people trying to classify the displeasure of this film go down to wfmitchell's post)). I don't fit any any of those classification. The other classification that needs to be on the list is 5) people didn't like this movie because it was not good. I found the film to be booring and forced. My wife picked it for us to see because she is a huge Kidman fan and she also likes Jude Law.Speaking of Law, it took a long time and a huge amount of suspension of belief for me to believe his southern accent. I can't help but wonder if they didn't make his character less talkative on purpose so we would't have to hear that tortured accent so much.As far as the movie, it took a long time for it to get interesting (about 1 or 1.5 hours), and then fell flat in it's ending. What was interesting, is that I did not know that this film was directed by Minghella. About 40 minutes into the movie, I asked my wife ""this isn't going to be another English Patient is it?"" It absolutely was.As far as the battle scenes. I'm trying to think of a word to describe the opening battle scene, but I think the most descriptive word that accurately describes it is simply ""dumb"". It was forced, it was unbelievable, it was silly and it was dumb. (After the battle I looked at my wife and asked ""was that just dumb?"" to which she vigorously nodded her head).The only bright point in the film was the performance of Zellweger. The role was a bit over acted like any decent comedy relief role, but it worked. From her speech pattern, her walk, her mannerisms and esp. her little quips (my favorite: ""If you want to get 3 feet up a bull's ass all you have to do is listen to sweethearts talk to each other""), she was able to create an almost cartoon-like character who did her job extremely well.I simply did not like this movie and I have to wonder about the kind of people who do say they like it (or the English Patient for that matter). I suspect you could categorize them in one category: 1) Soap opera fans",1.0,Anonymous,History
Epic Tragic Romance,"Minghella's Cold Mountain is a long one - over two and one half hours - and it delivers on all cylinders. It's a love story cast in the classic 'epic love story' mold.The acting cast are impeccable and impressive: Kidman, Law, Zellwegger, Hoffman, Gammon, Gleeson, Ribisi, Sutherland, Winstone, Baker, Portman - and an assortment of mostly English to round things out.That gives reason to pause: this is a movie about the US civil war with a mostly non-US cast and filmed in Romania. That's reason to pause and ponder.It's an intriguing tale, very bloody at times, and it's not hard to see where it's going, but its obviousness does not deter. It has its requisite 'stacked deck' and it's not hard to see where the final comeuppance there is going to be either.But in movies such as this such comeuppance is not without its price. This might be a love story, but it's also a tragic love story, and so even the scenes the audience long for must be tainted with sorrow.Alison Krauss sings a couple of tunes for the soundtrack, one of which is composed by G Sumner.Kidman is hardly my favourite actress or personality yet she shines here. Although she doesn't have all the classic features, Seale knew how to grasp what she has. If anyone stands out above their colleagues it is Renee who deservedly won an Oscar for her performance. But they're all good. And Law is an excellent counterpoint. And there are so many good anti-war quips in this bloody drama it's not funny.Watch for a punk rocker singing hillbilly tunes.Well made and infinitely more sympathetic than The English Patient from which it seems to derive theme and substance, but is it a keeper? Something to have on the DVD shelf?That's another question entirely. You might appreciate it and enjoy it but it's likely you won't want to buy it.",,Anonymous,History
I'm in love!,"I've now watched Cold Mountain twice in 24 hours. I have to say, this is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. When the film first came out, I wasn't at all tempted to view the movie. It appeared to be dull and depressing. I happened to receive the novel as a gift, and recently finished reading it. I was absolutely enchanted with the book. I've never really been impressed with movie adaptations of books. This novel was so brilliant, I felt an urge to see the visual adaptation. My oh my, I'm glad I've seen it!The acting was absolutely superb. The whole cast gave believable performances that totally envelopes you with emotion. My favorite character was Inman. He didn't say much, but his body language and facial expressions spoke a thousand words. I also think the chemistry between him and Ada closely represented what was written in the book. They only kissed once before Inman went to war, so some may think it's unreasonable for them to cling to their love through three or four years of separation. We're talking about the 1860's people...sex before marriage was uncalled for. A kiss meant so much more than it does nowadays! The cinematography was stunning. Who knew that Romania was so beautiful? According to the director's commentary, scenes jump from S. Carolina, to Virgina, and then to Romainia. The transitions were seamless, and you had no idea the filming was done on two different continents. You could also understand why Inman was so drawn to Cold Mountain. Not only was it Ada, but the locale was mesmerizing. The music was entertaining and poignant. Stobrod's fiddle changed his life forever, which in turn brought him together with his daughter he neglected for so many years. The music not only affected the characters emotionally, but the viewer as well.What more can I say? I am absolutely shocked. I had no idea I'd be so in love with this film. I'm an indie film type of gal, but I'm ecstatic I gave this big budget Hollywood film a chance!",10.0,Anonymous,History
"When a movie tries to be everything to everyone, it usually fails to live up to anyone's expectations. Cold Mountain is one of few exceptions to that rule.","When a movie tries to be everything to everyone, it usually fails to live up to anyone's expectations. Cold Mountain is one of few exceptions to that rule. The critically acclaimed, award-winning film is now available on 2-disc DVD and VHS.While the recent theatrical success of Fahrenheit 9/11 highlights the country's division regarding the war in Iraq, this film tells a similar tale. Set in a time where America was torn apart by clashing ideology and values, Cold Mountain is an epic saga of life during Civil War America. In it, we bear witness to the lives of a blossoming couple who are torn apart by duty and loyalty to one's country. Inman (Jude Law, Road To Perdition) is a young Confederate solider who, after being wounded in battle, deserts the war and takes a 300 mile walk toward home and his sweetheart, Ada Monroe (Oscar winner Nicole Kidman, The Hours). Inman's journey takes him away from the war and towards the peace he sees can only reside at home with his love. But, standing in his way are bounty hunters, slaves, sirens and Union soldiers at every turn. Meanwhile, well-to-do Ada takes a journey of her own. While his absence cements her feelings for him, Ada fears her love for Inman may be in vain as her countless letters go unanswered. When her father dies suddenly, she must learn to take care of herself and to survive long winters, merciless lawmen and overwhelming solitude. Along the way, she forms a life-long alliance with Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger, Chicago), a scrappy drifter who only knows hardship and back-breaking work.Cold Mountain is a breathtaking drama and love story starring award-winning actors, based on an award-winning book and directed by an award-winning director. Written by Charles Frazier in 1997, Cold Mountain, the novel, won the National Book Award that same year. Director, Anthony Minghella (The English Patient, The Talented Mr. Ripley) came across the book and decided to adapt it into the film now known for seven Oscar nominations including Best Supporting Actress, Best Actor, Best Cinematography and Best Score. In addition to about a thousand Romanian soldiers, the film also includes cameos by Natalie Portman (Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones), Jena Malone (Saved!), Jack White (singer of the rock band The White Stripes), Phillip Seymour Hoffman (25th Hour), Giovanni Ribisi (Lost in Translation), Donald Sutherland (The Italian Job) and more.Cold Mountain has been released on DVD and VHS. Special features on the 2-disc collector's edition include feature commentary with the director and editor; 'Climbing Cold Mountain', a documentary; 'Words and Music of Cold Mountain', a 90-plus minute special about the music behind the movie; 'A Journey to Cold Mountain', a featurette on the making of the film; 3 storyboard comparisons and 11 deleted scenes.Not only does this film deglamorize war and highlight its violence and brutality, Cold Mountain also takes us beyond the battlefield and into the lives of the civilians, many of them women, left behind to fend for themselves while the majority of the men fight for their cause. Rarely do you come across a film about the Civil War that is accessible to all people. Surprisingly, Cold Mountain has the ability to draw in men with its action and women with its romance. Though, the film does drag a bit at times, Zellweger makes up for it in her Oscar winning performance as the strong-willed yet humorous Ruby. In fact, all of the acting is brilliant. The above-mentioned cameos are all well executed and Kidman and Law are extremely believable as the star-crossed lovers, Ada and Inman. Shot largely in the unspoiled country of Romania, the landscape is stunningly beautiful. To top it all off, the well-crafted film is also set to a phenomenal score by Oscar-winning composer Gabriel Yared and original music performed by Sting, Elvis Costello, Jack White and many others.Cold Mountain gives the audience a little bit of everything: action, romance, drama, even some comedy. It is a sweeping epic with big battle sequences, passionate love scenes and a haunting score. And, yes, it is worth 2 ½ hours of your time.",7.0,Anonymous,History

It showed how hard it was not only fighting in the war like Inman, but the men and women fighting back home was also a struggle. Like the struggle with the Home Guard. I also loved the way Mingella showed the realism in the war scenes. This movie should have won more Golden Globes than it did. Especially more that Lord of the Rings! Which I personally thought sucked. But I don't think that Cold Mountain got enough respect as it should have. Nicole, Jude, Renee, and everyone else in the movie did a wonderful job!

"Awright Then ... a rooster, a goat, a fiddle and Zeger","Greetings again from the darkness.  My first movie of 2004 has already shown up on most critic's top 10 list for last year so my expectations were high, yet tempered with the knowledge that director Anthony Minghella was responsible for ""The English Patient"" (the focus of one of the funniest ""Seinfeld"" episodes).  What an unbelievable cast Minghella assembled.  Every scene brought a recognizable star.  However, as feared, the story is excruciatingly predictable throughout.  The wonderful performances make the movie quite watchable, but never should such a predictable story land on a best movie list of any respectable film lover.  Surprisingly, Renee' Zellweger is most impressive in her quite less-than-glamourous role while firing off one liners to pick up the pace in the painfully slow dialogue. The stellar cast includes the leads, Jude Law and Nicole Kidman and the celebrity baggage associated.  Young stars such as Natalie Portman, Jena Malone, Giovanni Ribisi and Charlie Hunnam (""Nicolas Nickelby"") are joined by screen vets such as Donald Sutherland, Kathy Baker, Brendan Gleeson and the great Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  Especially effective and creepy is Hunnam.  Biggest question I have is, why so many foreign actors in a civil war picture?  The battle scenes are filmed wonderfully and the countryside alternates between beautiful and stark and with hope and desperation.  Law and Kidman are fine in the leads, but really have little to do other than look longingly into the lens.

"Weak unintentional remake of, well, you know","I know, I know, this is the film of some fairly recent book that everybody loves. Well, to me it is just a lame remake of ""Gone With The Wind"" that is dumbed down for the modern era, with several essential ingredients removed because the film-makers probably feel they are too sophisticated for modern audiences to grasp. Girl falls for handsome dude, the Civil War is declared, everybody down on the plantation thinks this is just the coolest thing, handsome dude goes off to war, war is hell, girl's daddy dies leaving her to fend for herself, girl has a hard time keeping Tara, err, I mean the family farm going, handsome dude returns home all roughed up, girl and handsome dude ultimately wind up not together after all. The best part of ""Wind,"" Rhett Butler, is missing and replaced with the vastly inferior character played by Jude Law, and that isn't the only reason this is a lesser film.I will give credit where it is due. Renee Zellwegger absolutely steals the movie and runs around the block with it. Her character is refreshing and easily the best thing in the film. Some of the other supporting characters, such as Natalie Portman as a war widow in dire need of assistance, do fine work.But the list of faults is greater than the list of virtues. Jude Law is stiff and even more inarticulate than his character could possibly call for. Nicole Kidman is simply too old for the part of a naive preacher's daughter blushingly falling in love for the first time, and it is unbelievable that she continues looking daisy fresh even while supposedly suffering the greatest of privations. Donald Sutherland sleepwalks through his role as Kidman's father. The villains are one-dimensional and unbelievable, and the background townspeople who would have been a major factor in such peoples' lives pretty much non-existent with a few notable exceptions. There is a notable and inexplicable paucity of African-Americans, by the way, they seem to get thrown in for atmosphere once in a while and then disappear without a trace.War is hell, and this movie keeps hitting us over the head with that inarguable fact. Fluff it up with a few soap opera moments (women getting pregnant after one romance-novel type of encounter, for instance), some obvious foreshadowing (no, don't split up before going back down that mountain, someone always gets killed when that happens!), some really unnecessary and obscure plot complications with symbolism that just bangs away at your head like a gong (having a preacher try to throw a slave off a mountain after drugging her up but getting stopped from doing so by our oh-so-pure hero, then have that same preacher coincidentally save our hero later, what exactly were the screenwriters smoking anyway?) and you have ""Cold Mountain.""I have a pet peeve about films told out of sequence like this one. It is becoming a common tactic to tell films out of chronological order. The directors who do this are just telegraphing that they feel the story is insufficient to carry the film without tricks. This was terrific in ""Slaughterhouse Five"" thirty years ago, but is suddenly being used in films where it is pointless - as here. The most egregious recent example was ""21 Grams,"" where it was difficult to tell what the heck was going on despite the simple plot. There is absolutely no reason to tell ""Cold Mountain"" outside of normal order, and I hope this Hollywood fad passes away quickly. Please stop!I like history-based dramas. There was enough good acting and enough action and plot complications to keep my interest. This film, though, is not nearly as good as the hype it is getting as the big Oscar candidate this year. Zellwegger may deserve honors, but the rest of the film is just one step above dull.",6.0,Anonymous,History

"A rare, less-than-brutal review...","Those of you who have read my other reviews will know 2 things: Most of my reviews are written without remorse (they're either very good or savagely bad), and I don't waste either your time or mine on plot summaries. Someone else already wrote that, so on to my reviewAs I said in the subject line, this is a rare less-than-brutal review. There are flaws to this movie, but they don't drag it down into a quagmire of mediocrity.First, the good Renée Zellweger is brilliantly cast as the crotchety (and all the more lovable because of it) Ruby Thewes. She is a strong woman (which is immensely tantalizing to begin with), competent, and independent. She brings verve to the role, especially in the scene with the ""floggin' rooster.""Nicole Kidman is also perfectly cast as the ornamental-without-any-real-redeeming-value Ada Monroe. She is completely believable in the part. You might wonder if she could pull off going from the charming southern belle with nary a marketable skill to an independent, functional, and prosperous farm owner, but there it is.The cinematography gets a nod as well. Good location work and visuals.Now for the bad This movie is at least half an hour too long. It wanders, repeatedly, away from the point and seems to forget where it's trying to go. Better editing could have made this movie top-notch, but not enough of it found its way to the cutting room floor. The excessive length and meandering plot are a serious detraction from the overall quality of the film, preventing a higher score, but the core of the movie is reasonably solid, so I can't knock it TOO badly.6.5 (maybe a 7) out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Well worth renting - - a war movie with a heart,"My wife and I enjoyed this studio adaptation of a superior recent novel and highly recommend it to film buffs. Not everyone rates it a ""10"" but it achieves a number of commendable priorities. It conveys the rage, gore, and horror of battlefield combat with its mass confusion (not being conveyed in the present-day coverage of the Iraqi Insurgent War and Afghanistan Taliban- al Qaeda battles); also, it highlights the ambiguity of ""Support the Troops"" when their place is so desperately needed back at the homes of their loved ones. I know that purists might object about the accents of the multi-national cast. It is, however, a treat to hear the talented actress Renee Zellweger have a go at the most rambunctious and endearing character of the entire film. The film's score and end credit music are quite excellent and demonstrate something of the character of that period of U.S. culture. The director and art-scenery department also have produced a landmark depiction, meant to update some of the cultural ""imaging"" done in the classic GONE_WITH_THE_WIND. It is a great 21st Century historical epic, well grounded by the novelist Charles Frazier, who also consulted in the making of the film itself.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A valiant attempt but not quite there,"It's initial premise is based on the American Civil War but it's ultimately a love story. We start at the beginning of the war where the main characters (Kidman & Law) are obviously aware of each other and there's an obvious attraction, they have a passionate kiss on the day he leaves for the war. The main thrust of this film is for Law's character to return to Kidman's and his struggles to achieve that and her struggles to survive until he returns. The reason it fails to convince is that we don't see enough of this relationship before Law's character leaves for battle - it's difficult to believe the premise that 2 people yearn for each other so much given they've had so little contact. Everything else is just about fine, Renee Zellweger and her incumbent father and his entourage are lovely additions as is the threat from the gang chasing deserters. Sure it's a long film but it does hold the interest and the cinematography is great. An honourable attempt that doesn't quite make it but worth a watch nonetheless.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A true masterpiece,"To those that have a lot of trouble choosing just the right movie,I suggest going one step beyond the ordinary rental and purchasing this finely executed motion picture. I truly enjoyed this depiction of the love, the country and the time of the Civil War and how they emerge together depicting love and the power of love. You too will follow Inman back to his love that he longs for a few more precious moments (diamonds) with a women he hardly knows. The obstacles and challenges that he must endure. You will feel the painful separation and longing for a love that Ada felt for her Beau (Inman)....all the way to the end. She too going through her own personal challenges as she awaits his return.Truly, a love story that all can relate to especially those that have loved and lost in an untimely manner.Trust me...this is a movie that you would want to enjoy for many years in your movie collection.Thanks for this opportunity, Angel""This world won't stand long, god won't let...this world...stand long.""""They made the weather and they stand in the rain and say, sh*t it's raining.""",10.0,Anonymous,History
The Moose Hole - Review of Cold Mountain,"What is with Hollywood and the concept of love in the mitts of great disasters? There can be no greater example of this obsession than the highest grossing film of all time, Titanic. Though the Oscar darling can be blamed for the most recent trend, it is not the first to start this. There's the classic Casablanca and many other films set in and around World War II that do the same thing that is happening today in war features. Many films have come out recently and tried to duplicate the same result as Titanic but none have come close. Miramax is hoping they can break that statement with their film set in North Carolina during the Civil War. The Great War that divided this nation from 1861 to 1865 has become a hot subject as of late but few have taken the time to really focus, accurately at least, what this war was truly about. Instead they focus on side issues and stories that were only a small piece of the puzzle that was this time period. Gangs of New York, which starred Leonardo DiCaprio, is a perfect example of this. If the subject matter of Cold Mountain and the historical time period are blended in a way that creates an accurate interesting tale then maybe more and more films will be able to do the same.The story follows the young Confederate soldier who has deserted his position in the army in order to return home to be with his pre-war sweetheart. Inman is a man of very little words and actions but when he discovers the new missionary's daughter, Ada, he is at even greater loss for words. The two young North Carolina residents seem to take an interest in each other but that development is quickly put in jeopardy as Inman goes to join the other young men of the South to defend their homeland from `Northern aggression'. After he is wounded after the Siege of Petersburg, he deserts the Confederate army and starts a long and tiresome journey back to Cold Mountain. Along the way, he encounters many different characters that both help and hinder his journey home. Back in Cold Mountain, things are no better for Ada for the farm goes into disarray after the death of her father. With help of a drifter named Ruby, she hopes to survive long enough to reunite with Inman once again. The story for Cold Mountain may have been a bestselling plot when it was in book form but up on screen it is nothing short of disappointing. The plot is pretty predictable with several actions leading up to `major' events that could be seen from a mile away. The feature runs into the same problems as Gangs of New York, which opened this same time last year, in that it tries to cram too much into three hours and loses its focus not too far from the end.Though the cast seems to be an impressive group of Oscar favorites, few of them really show off why they should be labeled as such in this film. The biggest problem has to be Nicole Kidman's character, Ada. In the beginning of the film, it seems as though her character should be a little younger then Kidman herself makes her out to be. How old is Kidman? Forty years old? Whatever age she is, the way the character is presented, it seems she should be a lot younger. Another problem is featured after the death of Ada's father. Obviously Ada is going through rough times taking care of herself and the farm all alone but her faces just holds up so well. Boy! The medical care back in the 1860's may have been crap but make-up was just spectacular. This sarcasm being said, they could have made her character a little less dolled up, cosmetic-wise, as the film progressed. Despite a somewhat impressive performance by Jude Law, the bottom line is that the so-called relationship between Inman and Ada lack substance. They barely know each other and yet the audience is made to believe that they act as if they have known each other all their lives and once the war is over, they can go back to where they started? And critics should especially be yelled at believing this after ranting on such films as Daredevil and Pearl Harbor for attempting the same thing Cold Mountain tries to pull off. If there is anything good about the cast, it has to be Renee Zellweger's Ruby, who really picks up the film where it seems to be heading for a continuous decline.Overall, Cold Mountain manages to outdo last year's Gangs of New York but like the English Patient, it takes the film a long time to get to its predictable and pointless conclusion. Once again the Union on the basis of the Civil War are demonized and made to look like idiots no more so then in sequences like the scene that involved Natalie Portman's unnecessary character. Even the issue of freeing the slaves, which was not the main issue of the Civil War though many try to make it that way,  isn't as focused on correctly as they could have made it. What would have been a lot more interesting then the bland `love story' would have been the more grand battle sequences and issues of statehood and homeland but those are only battered about here and there without developing into anything grand scale. The film presents a valid topic of the Confederacy wanting to start a war and even doing anything they could to fight the North but when it comes to the end of the war, they blame everybody but themselves for what has been brought upon them. Director Minghella could have done something like that but chose not to. Once again another lackluster Civil War feature is presented to the movie-going public. Hopefully the American education system can pick up where this film fails to lead up to.My Rating: *** out of 5 (Grade: C)",6.0,Anonymous,History
Tintypes,"This Miramax film epic, directed by Anthony Minghella, will, no doubt, be hyped to the heavens by the studio in order for it to garner as many prizes as possible. Comments from viewers in this forum seem to indicate they love the film, which, at first glance has all the qualities to merit them. However, this Civil War story of romance in the midst of conflict, feels empty as soon as it ends. This film doesn't stay in one's memory for a lot longer than its 155 minutes of projection.Inman and Ada love affair is a bit a bit far fetched. Not only do they come from different backgrounds, but they don't appear to have anything in common. In the South of before the Civil War, with its class distinctions, Ada and Inman wouldn't have had a chance, let alone, have the long distance love affair that seems to hold the narrative.The other problem the film has is the many fake Southern accents, which is understandable when an international cast has been assembled to recreate the same Southerners that wouldn't probably understand what they're talking about.After all is said and done,  Ada only gets to keep Inman's image in the tintype picture he gives her, and as another Southern heroine, Scarlet O'Hara, she will survive the tragedy and come out ahead of the game.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Stop Minghella before he strikes again!,"What gives Anthony Minghella the right to ruin two extraordinary works of fiction?? First, he destroyed The English Patient, which was bad enough, but now I discover he's butchered Cold Mountain - butchered!!!I had such a strange reaction to The English Patient. My son and I went to see it the first weekend it was released, and I was so disappointed, but told my son I felt like I needed to read the book. I drove straight to Barnes and Noble, bought it, read it, and tried to figure out what in the world the critics were talking about when they said Minghella had trusted enough in the intelligence of the movie-going public to give them a great film. That is what he most surely did not do.I do not ordinarily read a great deal of fiction, but Cold Mountain was so highly recommended by friends that I felt compelled to read it. I did not see Cold Mountain, the movie, when it played in theaters, and it was because of what Minghella had done to The English Patient. But like a fool, I rented it today, and I'm so upset, I had to vent my frustration and, most of all, my sadness, that someone could have taken this beautiful story and crafted it into something almost as beautiful on the screen, and now they never will.READ THE BOOK AND LET THE MOVIE ROT ON THE SHELF. I will never be taken in by a Minghella project again. I think he may be one of the worst directors working today, and I'm tired of the praise Hollywood heaps upon his head. It must be that no one in Hollywood reads anymore. This movie bears no resemblance to the book, except for the names of the characters. Minghella's ego must know no bounds, and if he didn't like the book, then why didn't he write an original screenplay and leave the book alone. Even if I hadn't read the book, I would still consider this movie one of the worst I've seen from 2003; and I've seen almost everything that's been released for viewing in the USA.Elaine, you aren't going to like this one either.",1.0,Anonymous,History
No chemistry kills the romance,"I'm not quite sure if it was bad casting or lazy writing.  Either way, the love story that runs through COLD MOUNTAIN is like ice on a pond: looks great from a far but don't dare tread on it.  Unfortunately, the film maker sinks deeply through the surface as the picture concerns itself with endless voice overs from Nicole Kidman to her love Jude Law.  Repetitive and filled with the same words, you start to wonder what would have happened, if they had just concentrated on the crazy union army and its cast of evil characters.  Nonetheless, Law does a wonderful job opposite Kidman with whom he has absolutely no chemistry.  Renee Zellwegger is a bit annoying but bearable.  The scenery is nice and the costumes cool (except for Kidman who looks like she's out of 1934 glamour magazine as opposed to 1864).",,Anonymous,History
Tough Climb,"Some films are like sprints. ""Cold Mountain"" is a marathon. It pushes and pulls you a long way from point A to point Z, forcing you to bear witness to a lot of cruelty, devastation, and wildly variant plot lines, all in a sincere albeit misplaced effort to faithfully reproduce the Charles Frazier novel on screen. Oppressive, yes, but at least it's never dull.Inman (Jude Law) is a Confederate soldier, badly wounded, who decides to give up the Civil War and return to his North Carolina home, Cold Mountain. ""Come back to me is my request"" writes his lover, Ada (Nicole Kidman), and he obliges. While Inman meets a deviant preacher, a young war widow, and a kindly goatwoman en route, Ada keeps the house her father owned with the help of a female Huckleberry Finn named Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger).""Cold Mountain"" runs nearly two and a half hours, and you feel every minute of it. Because the film compresses everything so much, trying to fit all of Frazier's vision in, it never quite breathes in the way of another longer war epic such as ""Lawrence Of Arabia"" (an unfairly great film, yes, but those are the stakes ""Cold Mountain"" director Anthony Minghella plays for). While Ruby is running Ada through various farm chores, for example, she's also providing pertinent details on her character and motivation through talky exposition. Everyone in the film seems to have a monologue to deliver, crammed one after the other like air traffic over O'Hare.The other thing that makes ""Cold Mountain"" tough is its capacity for sadness. Sure bad things happen to good people, but seldom in so concentrated a form. This is also largely faithful to the book, but it should be pointed out that the novel uses its opportunity to better space out the ""war is hell"" theme. Also, certain characters suffer a worse fate in the movie than the novel (i.e. the Swanger family, the girl in the canoe, the war widow if you catch the extra scene on DVD). Usually films lighten up on a novel's content precisely because hard scenes one against the other alienate an audience, but Minghella trusts his audience to bear with him.I didn't exactly, but I did admire ""Cold Mountain"" for what it was, a stage for uniformly splendid acting and camera-work. Law nicely develops an understated tone as Inman, man of few words, while Kidman makes the romantic parts sing louder than they otherwise would and plays a good straight man to Zellweger, who gets most of the best lines and delivers them with gusto. The only great performance I saw was Brendan Gleeson as Stobrod, who really faked me out with his accent and with Zellweger co-stars in the best sequence in the film, when they meet again after a long separation.""He's so full of manure,"" Ruby says. ""We could stick 'em in the dirt and grow another just like 'em.""Minghella works in some great shots that keep you watching even as they don't lead anywhere, aided by an authentic-feeling musical score that feels at times almost devastating. In this way, ""Cold Mountain"" pushes in your face the fact the Civil War was fought by real people, not just played out in the quaint pages of a history book.I was reminded, with that music and Ada's voice-over letter readings, of Ken Burns' famous ""Civil War"" documentary. While not as inspiring or commanding as that, ""Cold Mountain"" retains the same aesthetic, and on that level succeeds more often than it does not. I just question anyone's ability to come to this movie without doing some serious homework, and when you do the homework, it may prove more interesting to you than the film itself.",6.0,Anonymous,History

I never bought into the great love between the Kidman and Law characters--love at first site (especially intense/non-physical love) is hard to convey and altho they are fine actors, and I truly enjoyed the growth/transformation of the Kidman character throughout the movie, I didn't buy the premise.

This film would melt even the coldest of hearts.,"Set during the American Civil War and comprising of an all-star cast, this romantic tragedy cannot fail to captivate. The story alternates its focus between Ada Goodman (Nicole Kidman), a young reverends daughter, and Inman (Jude Law), a wounded Confederate soldier.With the unexpected death of her father, Ada watches as their farm falls into disrepair, relying only on her letters to Inman to help her through the long winter. When Ruby (Renee Zellweger) wanders onto the farm one day offering help, an inseparable bond begins between the pair. With new found strength the two gradually put the farm back together, whilst secretly looking after Ruby's estranged fiddler father.Determined to make it back to Cold Mountain after three years of being separated from his beloved Ada, Inman uses the last of his strength to drag himself out of his hospital bed and onto the long road home. Encountering slaves, bounty hunters, deserters, women of the night and a witch along the way, Inman's journey is a slow and treacherous one.With a strong story (based on the novel by Charles Frazier) and excellent acting, this film would melt even the coldest of hearts.",10.0,Anonymous,History

You will also enjoy this movie if you have studied the Civil War. I kept on picking up on things and saying ""oh yea, I learned that"".

As is the case with Oakland, there's no ""there, there.""

"If You Haven't Seen It, Don't","Cold Mountain is seriously over-rated and over-blown. It would be improved by losing an hour, and from this viewer's standpoint, by losing the entire 2-1/2 hours. It is s l o w, utterly predictable and irritating. Neither Nicole Kidman nor Jude Law make convincing Southerners and, though she won an Academy Award for her role, Renee Zellweger is less believable than either of them. For obvious reasons, Cold Mountain reminded me of Gone with the Wind, another Civil War story that seemed to this movie-goer to last longer than the war itself. Though the earlier movie belonged to the romantic fiction category and this one pretends to be more realistic, they are alike in seeking to capture (as does Tolstoy's War and Peace) history through the stories of fictional characters. Tolstoy, of course, produced a truly great novel which no film maker has yet brought successfully to the screen. In its time, Gone with the Wind was an extremely successful movie from a box office standpoint and won many awards which, in this reviewer's opinion, were totally undeserved. It was based on a very bad though quite popular novel. As a novel, Cold Mountain is better than Gone with the Wind though that isn't saying much. As a movie, it also won more awards than it deserved but it fell short of the success the makers hoped for and may have expected. Gone with the Wind is proof of the adage that no one ever went broke under-estimating the taste of the American people. Cold Mountain is less dramatic proof of the same adage. It didn't make its producers rich but it didn't exactly make them poor either. Crimes against art often pay very well.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Loved it!,"This was a really good movie. After reading several comments, I have to address some of theissues with the execution of the film. Nicole Kidman's accent was actually pretty good. I thought shesounded reasonably like a South Carolinian.Several viewers mentioned the lack of African-Americanroles/issues in the film. Because the mountains of NC were hometo a large percentage of poor farmers, sharecroppers andmountain folk, there weren't many slaves in the area and mountainpeople were some of the last to get involved in the war. They hadno interest in it one way or the other since they didn't own slaves orplantations. Their plight would remain largely unchanged nomatter the outcome. Many were Union sympathizers on the slaveryissue, but served their native South when NC finally got involved inthe war.The language might have been a little flowery and awkward, but Ithought easily overlooked.I thought the scenes of the effects of war on the homefront(starvation, worthless money, home guard and yankee raids)brought something to the film not always seen in other CivilWar-era movies.",,Anonymous,History
lukewarmed over cold mountain,"I read the book nearly four years ago. I very much enjoyed that and seem to recall it had much more interiority for Inman, whereas this film seemed focused on Ada/Ruby for character development. Jude Law was left to speak in silence too much of the time. He was longing embodied, though righteous (overly so at times).I almost wish they had given the narration of letters to Inman rather than Ada, it would have helped with his character as a deserter who has seen too much disaster. The interplay of Ada/Ruby seemed to work well-enough on its own.Also in the novel, the trek seemed more arduous, with more on the isolated survival of Inman. And I recall passages that felt quite poetic, that helped to distract me from the distinction what on film seemed to much like the good characters and the bad characters. Maybe more strife and chafing between Ada and Ruby would have helped? More dishonor for other deserters, as opposed to Inman??That said, this certainly makes fine use of the music cited in the text. And enough of the quirky encounters are decently recapped here. Seemed like an awful lot of close-ups, playing up the romance angle. The eventual sex scene was funny to me, as it seemed out of place with an edit of the two just laying in what I thought was post-coitus first and then into the beast with two backs and plenty  more wounds.Sex was not a problem for me, but a brutal beginning bugged some with me. Actually I recall the book being far more visceral, but reading pages of slaughter and amputation provides a better barrier of distance than on screen jump-cuts and gouges.This will win awards as a treacly epic when its really one of those not-so-bad, not-so-great films, I'd rather it had more of the arty starkness of Jim Jarmusch's ""Dead Man.""Who will make ""Blood Meridian"" into a film, one frets.If you are inclined to read the novel first, I urge you to do so.

Good character study and great original score,"I saw Cold Mountain last night after hearing some good reviews about it and good performances. I thought I was going to like the film before I saw it, and well I was right. The film is good on many levels. The character study is great and there was really no bad acting besides a little cheesy romantic lines but thats about it. The large cast was great. There was some great scenes like the Civil War battle at Petersburg, the Union soldiers coming in the woman's house for food and for sex, or the return home for Inmann. The music was amazing like the piano playing, the Sting song, and the battle choir song. Overall, a good 2 hrs. 34 min film with a great casting choice by Anthony Minghella.

"Cold Mountain is predictable, but manages to propose some reflection on the violent impulses of the human being","When watching a movie like Cold Mountain, it's not difficult to guess what will happen to it: we already know that the Academy will give it a lot of Oscar nominations and the general public will be moved by the love story and the beautiful landscapes. That doesn't make it a good movie. Especially since Cold Mountain is as predictable on screen as it is off it: from the first minute the story is drawn, step by step, until its end.Director and screenwriter Anthony Minghella has already shown that he knows how to adapt literary works. The English Patient and especially The Talented Ripley are great transpositions of bestsellers to the movies - popular films that are sophisticated, intelligent and vibrant at the same time. None of these traits apply to Cold Mountain, which is clearly inspired by the trajectory of Homer's hero Odysseus Odysseus. The atmosphere that surrounds the impossible romance between Ada and Inman is cold as the ice of the mountains of the title, and this is due in part to the dialogues that border on the ridiculous - ""Come back to me as my request"" the most ""exciting"" thing Ada has to say to her lover in the letter sent to him.Based on the book by Charles Frazier, Cold Mountain is set during the American Civil War and revolves around the journey undertaken by the young Inman Balis, a Confederate soldier who deserts and decides to return to his hometown in order to be reunited with his beloved, Ada Monroe. Along the way, Inman encounters several strange figures as he tries to escape his former army mates, as the punishment for desertion is death. In turn, Ada faces the decadence of the South, caused by the war, and tries to survive the misery and the advances of the unscrupulous Teague, who takes advantage of his position as a representative of the 'Law' to take the goods of his landowner neighbors.The first few minutes of screening, which focus on one of the numerous battles between Union and Confederate soldiers, are the best of the film, as Minghella confidently guides the complicated sequence and adds details that effectively illustrate the bloody nature of the war: in a certain moment, for example, we see Southern soldiers collecting coats and boots from their dead comrades in order to redistribute them to those still on active duty. In the same way, the 'dusty' photography and the shots made with the camera in hand lend an almost documentary air to the chaos that follows. Furthermore, the explosion seen in this first act of the narrative is impressive, portraying the force of the fireball as it shows a poor soldier's clothes being literally dissolved by the heat.Unfortunately, this sequence ends after 15 minutes of projection, leaving us with the next 140 minutes, which are divided between Inman's journey and Ada's tribulations. Regarding the first, the biggest surprise (at least for me, who haven't read Frazier's book) concerns the similarities between the soldier's adventures and Homer's Odyssey: the mermaids (in this case, the nymphomaniacs led by the always beautiful Melora Walters) to the 'witch' who tends to Inman's wounds, several elements of the Greek classic appear in Cold Mountain, which is nonetheless interesting. Ada's 'growth' never rings true, thanks in part to Nicole Kidman's performance.Kidman, by the way, represents one of the weakest points of the production: after offering great performances in works like Dogville, The Hours, Moulin Rouge! And The Others, the beautiful actress demonstrates that she can also make a mistake by transforming Ada into an unreal figure, completely at odds with the rest of the cast. At no time does the girl really seem to belong to the same universe as the errant Ruby or the suffering Sally: always made up and clean, Ada gets to annoy her with her fragile and childish voice (a problem that Kidman managed to get around in her other works). To make matters worse, the actress's southern accent is inconstant - and even Brazilian viewers will be able to easily perceive the different cadence that he assumes at different moments of the projection. Her character undergoes a radical transformation over the course of the film (the cliché young city girl who loses her freshness in the countryside), but this is only noticed by the tan of her skin and her wielding a shotgun at the end.Jude Law, in turn, is hampered by Minghella's weak script, which does not bother to study the changes experienced by Inman: why does the young man, who was initially so determined to accompany his friends towards the war, suddenly become if so disillusioned? Of course, the shock caused by the massacre seen at the beginning of the story contributes to altering his perception, but it does not explain his revolt regarding the motivations of the conflict (he goes so far as to say that he no longer wants to risk his life 'for a cause he does not believe in. '). Now, of course, Minghella tried, with this, to lead the viewer to ignore the fact that his hero was on the 'worst' side of the battle, defending the interests of the slaveholding landowners - which is still a trick of the director, who doesn't answer how (and when) Inman concludes that that 'cause' was no longer his. The result is that the soldier becomes a non-dimensional figure - and I'm willing to bet that much of the impact of Law's performance is due to the beard with which he appears from the second act, which gives an air of suffering and sacrifice to the character.Incidentally, Law and Kidman's performances don't just fail individually; the relationship between its characters, which is, after all, the center of Cold Mountain, is never convincing. Minghella treats the romance as something tragic, dramatic, but forgets to give veracity to the involvement between Ada and Inman. As if that wasn't enough, the filmmaker resorts to a ridiculous scene when trying to establish a connection between the couple, showing Inman capturing a dove inside the Church.Renée Zellweger, on the other hand, ends up standing out precisely for sharing all her scenes with the faded Nicole Kidman, but the fact is that Ruby also becomes quite cartoonish (note the exaggerated way in which she walks). Zellweger makes you laugh, it's true, but that shouldn't be enough to earn her a Best Actress nomination. On the other hand, it is important to highlight the excellent performances of three other Cold Mountain cast members: Philip Seymour Hoffman is (as usual) impeccable as the ambiguous Veasey; Kathy Baker is moved by Sally's suffering; and Natalie Portman stars in the only scene in the film capable of causing any emotional impact - and if anyone deserves recognition for her work in this production, it's the girl.What also fills the eyes are the beautiful landscapes recorded in Romania, which simulates the mountains of North Carolina, the production is impeccably photographed, but fails even in historical matters, after all, if we are talking about the American Civil War, where are the black characters, part of that period? In reality, the slaves are only used to illustrate the 'kindness' of Ada, who is willing to serve them refreshments during a feast. Doing its part, the soundtrack punctuates and helps accentuate Inman's dramatic walk home and Ada's endless wait. Love motivates them to keep moving forward, even when there seems to be no way out. But don't be fooled, Cold Mountain is not a simple love story. First, because the two protagonists are most of the time apart, but mainly because, as Ada Monroe will learn, love alone is not enough to survive in such a harsh world. A lot of people, though, may leave this new Minghella film disappointed. But those who don't care about the slightly contradictory outcome will understand why the film was considered one of the best of the year of its release.Despite the film having a long and unnecessary duration, Anthony Minghella is even successful in the war part of the film - the battle scenes at the beginning are well done and the script manages to propose some reflection on the violent impulses of the human being, something welcome these days. A good example of this is the anti-war speech of Natalie Portman's character, just before she blows the brains out of the defenseless soldier, in one of the best scenes in the film. But otherwise, what Minghella does is underestimate the spectator's ability to reason with such a chewed up plot. While waiting for her lover, Ada has a vision of him reflected in the water of the farm's well - what is seen is a man staggering and crows flying around the place. When this kind of premonition comes to fruition at the end of the film, it's obvious that it's a reference to the well scene, so Ada didn't need to repeat, in words, what the viewer had already perceived. Good cinema dispenses with dialogues to explain the images. This elementary rule Minghella should already know by heart.",7.0,Anonymous,History
This is less of a film review and more of a commentary of some of the reviews herein presented,"Reading through the many reviews it's obvious that in spite of their confident tone, most have little real knowledge of the period beyond what they've seen in movies. May I suggest that these self-absorbed experts read the novel on which the film is based and then read some 19th century social history and a few histories of the post-Gettysburg South. The relationship between the two main characters, Inman (Jude Law) and Ada, (Nicole Kidman) is rather accurate and sufficiently developed to drive the plot. Young people unfamiliar with how love developed even 75 years ago need to understand how loving relationships evolved in the Victorian era: in fact, the main relationship is portrayed quite accurately, and if that seems underdeveloped...well, it isn't. The Ruby character (Rene Zellweger) is terrific, presenting an excellent contrast between the well bred quintessential Southern woman and the generally not well film-documented hardscrable backwoods woman. The Battle of the Crater at Petersburg July 1864 is not overly detailed but accurately represented. The trials and tribulations of the Confederate Home Front present, in all their glory, a willingness of some people to abandoned personal honesty and honor in exchange for power and wealth, providing a plethora of hissable villany. Cold Mountain is a long film at more than 2 hours and 30 minutes but it's thoughtful, absorbing, and very well acted but be forwarned: it isn't a war film but a dramatic antiwar movie.",8.0,Anonymous,History
One of my top 10 fav movies!,A beautiful love story that'll pull you in from the beginning.,10.0,Anonymous,History
It has a bit of everything but just a bit,"It has some romance, some drama, some adventure, war scenes and funny moments and a classic story with some symbolism. Such a pity that it doesn't go further than that and excel on improving a particular genre. Some of the bad guys are already poor written and feel flat and towards the end it looks like they had to endure even more lazy writing. The romance part didn't really make me burst into tears but it's ok, I didn't expect that. It's not bad, don't get me wrong, it just could have been done better.There is one scene there with Natalie Portman that it's just beautifully tragic and for me is pure gold, even though at first sight I didn't know what to say about casting her.A 7 out of 10 from me.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A Well Made Picture,"A well made film. I'd like to see a more gritty version as this is a bit ""pretty"", but it's got great characters and really nice cinematography. The intro war looks amazing the way it was shot. Through this film we see how the Civil War affected many families throughout the country and how some abused the power.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Movie passes but not Mountains,"Starting in I had a trepidation that ""Cold Mountain"" was going to be sympathetic to the South. It takes place in the fictional town of Cold Mountain in western North Carolina.  The townfolk are constructing a church in anticipation of the arrival of the new pastor (Canadian Donald Sutherland) and his daughter (raised in Australia Nicole Kidman).  Sparks eventually fly between the daughter, Ada, and a carpenter, Inman (Englishman Jude Law).The romance between the two is supposedly the main plot point sustaining the movie but it's really to demonstrate the futility and eventual desperation of the Confederacy.  When war was announced, the menfolk of the town were enthusiastic to join the fight.  Three years later, some of them - those that haven't died - have had their fill of fighting and try to return home as deserters.Here's where the dramatic tension comes in the film.  The South had set up a Home Guard, a force granted powers to ensure deserters and the people who sheltered them were punished.  Naturally the Home Guard abused those powers and that's what we see in ""Cold Mountain"".I read one negative review regarding the lack of African-Americans in the film.  It is true their are very few scenes with slaves but I let is slide because the scenes take place mainly in the Appalachians where slavery was not common.  Indeed it gets me to thinking why the people there would want to fight for a system that was against their interests.What did confuse me were the mountains.  The Appalachians are ancient and rounded.  The film was shot in Romania and its craggy Carpathians.  I expected to see troikas in the mountain snow scenes.Lastly a reviewer remarked the Renee Zellweger appeared to be channeling Granny Clampett.  It was meant as a insult but I like that.  I now think of her character as Granny Clampett's Granny.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Yawn!,"Two words best sum up this resplendent bore of a movie - ""Oscar Bait."" Everything about it seems to be a conspicuous grab for prestige and Academy Award consideration. But more often than not things go horribly awry.Its a splendid looking film, but the design more correctly evokes Trannsylvania than the Old South. More than once I awaited gypsy caravans and torch bearing villagers.In homage we have Jude Law dressing up as the Wolf Man for much of the running time, stumbling through thickets in search of Nicole Kidman. He has the good sense to keep his mouth shut most of the time - his accent being so studied that it lacks all credibility - adopting a generally pained expression that suffices for most emotions.Nicole Kidman is simply woeful. Much too old for the part, she lapses between Australian twang and Southern drawl to basically nil effect. We simply don't care about Ada as portrayed by the now familiar Kidman twitches.Renee Zellweger makes amends for Kidman stealing the Oscar that should have been hers for Chicago by stealing Kidman's film from under her. Its not much of an achievement, given that La Kidman seems to be asleep for most of the film.Amongst the mugging supporting cast, Giovanni Ribisi stands out, incomprehensibly decked out as Theda Bara with a beard.It may go on to triumph at the Oscars, but that will be small consolation to people suckered into seeing a sterile, boring film.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Great movie,"I'm going to keep this review as short as possible as most reviews posted on this site are startlingly long and I will neither waste my time over-writing a review, or yours giving you a book to read; this movie is incredible. It is the story of a strong and powerful woman left alone by her husband living only with her children in a terrifyingly cold and isolating mountain pass with another woman, desperately awaiting the return of her husband from the war. Throughout the film she undergoes many trials and tribulations that test her faith in her husband, but the zenith of the film occurs when she is finally reunited with him and the two are finally able to express the love they've coveted for so many long months. It's these kind of movies that made me fall in love with Nicole Kidman and I will remain a fan of hers until I die. I suggest all to rent/buy this movie as soon as possible and to keep an eye out for her next film ""Trespass"" while your at it. It looks like a winner. http://bitly.com/o7TwhG",,Anonymous,History
A Return to Classica,"Probably one of the more pronounced impressions of this film is its dusty and nostalgic feeling for old classics.  It has all the right ingredients - a small farm town, a southern belle, her farmhand lover, a war, villains and deceivers everywhere, and your immortal tragedy.  But in order to bake a cake it takes more than just ingredients, it also takes exquisite chefs. And who better for such a job than Jude Law, Renee Zellweger, Nicole Kidman, Donald Sutherland, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and Natalie Portman.I found the most difficult part of the movie to digest in terms of plot to be the short-lived courtship of Ada Monroe (Kidman) and Inman (Jude Law). Once you can accept that their almost nonexistent relationship has had an enormous effect on them both, the movie seems to movie along without further questioning.  The plot is very simple.  It is the Civil War and Inman is a confederate officer gone off to war.  Ada agrees to wait for him but months and then years pass.  To help her survive, Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger) comes to help her on the farm.  The two become close friends during dark times.  The only thing keeping Inman going out on the battlefield is the letters he receives from Ada.  When she tells him to come back to her he obeys, but the journey home proves harder than he ever could have imagined.I have wondered how true to life some of the elements of this story are. More men died in the Civil War than all the other wars combined.  That alone should give some indication of how gruesome life was at that time.  But for those that lived on or who sat at home and waited, praying for their loved ones to return, what was it like for them?  This movie tries to give some indication of that existence.  The horrors it shows I can only hope weren't real but in my gut believe they could have been much worse.This movie seemed to depict how two young people were trying not to fall in love and yet despite themselves did so completely.  Outside influence symbolized by the war is so determined to break them apart in their struggle towards one another.  When all else appears to have to gone to hell, these two individuals cling tightly to what they believe and pray they have left - each other.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Disappointing,"For all its noble intentions this movie never gets off the ground.  The opening battle sequences fall short of the mark and everything afterwords does as well.  The usually admirable Jude Law seems to sleep walk through his role; Nicole Kidman never seems to fit the part of Ada, Donald Sutherland is miscast, and Renee Zelwinger is a stereotype.  John Phillip Seymour has the only interesting, if unbelievable, role in the whole effort. 5 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Great love story,"This is definitely one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever seen. It had some bad critics but I don't see, why. It's about a strong love that keeps a person alive for more than 3 years. And they know both, why they want to live - to see each other again. It's told with such intensity and it speaks right to your heart. All the time, you wish that they see each other again, you feel what Inman has to endure while he wanders through the woods. The actors are brilliant: Nicole Kidman as Ada, she embodies all the things - Ada's inability to cope with the situation that Inman is gone, the situation after her Dad is dead (she doesn't know how to cook or how to lead a farm); but also Jude Law: he plays the silent Inman so well, the one who never says much, so there are many things left unsaid. Renée Zellweger even received an Oscar for her performance of the farmer girl Ruby who helps Ada to get along. I think she really deserved it. Great movie! Watch it!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Too long.,"This film is a butt-numbing 2 1/2 hours long & I trekked about those mountains & in the rivers with Jude Law until I was worn out!  Interesting characters along the way non-developed by the film maker (such as the old woman in the mountains, who was she, why was she there?).  Anyway, Nichole looked good, then not so good, then with stringy hair, slovenly but still good looking (she just IS).  Renee stole the show.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Minghella and his mountain,"Anthony Minghella, perhaps not a genius, but a storyteller. This film is a visual feast, the cinematography is in parts, breathtaking. Each camera angle adds to the simple message, this is not a story about the American Civil War, this is a story about love. Any person who is after realism will be sorely disappointed. Despite the constant historical references, Jude Law escaping and wandering back to Ada is something that in essence, is part of the theme of love, the theme of the beauty in love. Of course most instances are highly improbable and sometimes laughable e.g. that he can stray across a woman herding goats and be lifted by an old woman to be nurtured back to life, but what we must understand is that in film, nothing is realistic. Nothing is real. Accept that and I believe this film is incredible. So it may be designed to pull on the heartstrings, but what is cinema for if not for evoking emotion? Cold Mountain is not a masterpiece but is still a piece of art. Grudgingly, I'll accept some lines are cheesy, out of place, ridiculous, but isn't that what you want from a love story? Perhaps I am just a romantic but I found this gripping, not didn't find it long and boring, but then I enjoyed The English Patient. I'd say, definitely, this is worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Good but...,"I must admit, after watching the trailers, I wanted to despise this movie. It seemed a heap of melodrama with some utterly stupid dialogue (what was Ruby saying about the weather again?  Come on...) intended only to win Oscars for Miramax.  And while it had all the trademarks of Minghella, the overt symbolism and sheer epic-ness seemed to work for it.  Certainly the performances by Jude Law and Renee Zellweger will not go unnoticed come the Oscars - Jude is quite touching as a man of few words with his emotions all stirring beneath his face, and Renee is a barrel of energy and intensity who can put on the brakes when she has to.  Both create very unique performances, which cannot, unfortunately, be said of Nicole Kidman.  Brilliant in the Hours, here she returns to her trademark ticks and stock emotions, which are normally quite nice, but certainly don't match up with the other more subtle and intriguing people that surround her.  As well, her accent is pretty awful, even for Hollywood-impersonates-the-South standards, and she is FAR too old for the role this time.  Really surprising is Natalie Portman in her small role, getting back to acting after her horrendous turns in Star Wars. In five minutes of screen time she shows more layering and creates more understanding for a character than she has in the last five years of her career.  Perhaps she should have been given a chance at Ada, although Miramax must have desired a huge star in the lead, regardless of how ill-suited she is for it.  Overall, probably Minghella's best movie to date, with possible Oscars for Cinematography, Actor, and Supporting Actress, but if this gets Director and Picture over ROTK, it'll be a crime. 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
Lack of relationship building early in film.,"One of the most notable criticisms is the lack of relationship building between Inman and Ada in the beginning of the film. Having not read the novel, is there a deeper explanation? I do believe that in the 1860's relationship development was much shallower than what we perceive to be necessary today (depending on how you look at it). In the film the characters seem like genuine good people. The interaction between these two early in the film certainly doesn't warrant almost getting yourself killed everyday to 'get back to her.' Maybe it's that 'in love' vibe that people get when they first flip out over someone - and it just never wore off? That seemed like the only thing that didn't make much sense about the story line.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Good,"I actually found myself watching it four times in a row. I probably could have watched it 24 hours straight, but I didn't want to ruin it right away, you know? In the waning days of the American Civil War, a wounded soldier embarks on a perilous journey back home to Cold Mountain, North Carolina to reunite with his sweetheart. So what do we get? We get sludge. You can tell that everybody in this movie knew that it was a stinker, so why try? Maybe the worst thing about this movie is that deep down, beneath the bad acting and the awful script, there were some okay ideas.

Amazonian,"I heard lots about this movie. I rented it when it came out on DVD. Watched it. Thought it was well shot. Well staged. Well acted. Well directed. Heck, even the script was good.But there was something missing.What was it? Oh yeah, the guy got shot in the end, and his wife winds up with the good life.We live in a day and age where the marketers are chasing social trends. Social trends in turn feed off of the marketing that affects society. One synergizes with the other. It's a chicken and egg thing. One follows the others' trend, hoping to cash in. Who's in the lead? I have no idea. But the morning news, the soap operas, the game shows, nearly everything you can think of is aimed at garnishing dollars. And ""Cold Mountain"" was no different.Consider; Law goes off to fight in the war while Kidman stays home. Not a big variance in theme there, but Law's character gets challenged with the harsh brutality of Civil War, while Kidman's character, though facing her own challenges at home, isn't quite so fretted with what could happen to her so much as what could happen to her neighbors.We see one love making scene after Law's character comes home, and then a violent confrontation. And Law get's shot. Kidman? She goes on to live a happy and fruitful life now that she's been given a child from her alleged love of choice. I don't know about you, but it seemed more like Kidman's character was waiting to be fertilized than to protect her man.Is this worrisome? Not really. If any feminist thinks this is a good message, then they're off their rocker. Me, I found it trite. A much better film with much the same story, better production values, and just scoring higher marks in the theme and values department, is Ang Lee's ""Ride With the Devil"".Lee's film tells a better story; the harsh non-mystical realities of tribal warfare, and why men and women need each other, and why they create families that need one another as well. It's a story of survival to keep the hope of romance and family alive. In short, it's a better film on all levels.""Cold Mountain"" is sophomoric pablum. It's aimed at the ""Sex in the City"" crowd, only designed to ride on the coat tails of other historic Civil War success stories.And that's why I didn't take a liking to ""Cold Mountain"". The film should've been renamed ""Cold Women"", for not one man of worth survives to the end of this film. And the one man who should have, was shot in the gut, and needlessly so.I guess you could say I don't really like this film much.Watch it for its aesthetics, but then understand what you've seen after it's all said and done.

It painted a lot of pretty and pretty awful pictures, but in the end I really didn't feel emotionally attached to the two lead characters. I just felt like everything surrounding them was contrived, even the end.  For me what resonated the most were the other stories, especially that of Natalie Portman's character...that was real heartbreak.

The main love story is very well acted and there does not seem to be too many follies into the ""who cares"".From the trailers and TV spots I was expecting to be bored silly by this movie, only sitting through it to keep my wife company.I was very surprised, lots of war stuff for the boys, and an engaging love story without rambling into the corny or cliché.Nicole Kidman and Jude Law both deliver excellent performances without very many foibles in the accent department.A little predictable in the end but very much worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Could have been better,"I had mixed feelings going into this film as the trailer was promising but it also appeared to be a film obviously gearing itself towards the Oscar race. The film itself is well shot and has some beautiful cinematography but it is the film's story that causes it to not live up to the hype. For whatever reason I found that I did not care about Nicole Kidman's side of the story nor did I care about the love story. To have a gripping love story when the main characters are not in the same scenes is hard, but not impossible, to do, and they fail here. Jude Law's side of the story is entertaining and I would argue a great 2 hour movie could have been made just with Law's story including a lot more of Phillip Seymour Hoffman's entertaining character. But instead we get a drawn out film that shows some great promise(the Civil War scene, the various character's Jude Law meets)mixed with a lot of unnecessary scenes and a story that fails to engage the viewer beyond it's surface.

The movie had a good balance of drama, romance and a bit of humor. My husband even liked it and he is not too into love stories. The scenery in parts of this movie was spectacular. Jude Law did an amazing job of acting. He should have won that Oscar. This movie does have some harsh war scenes so if you are too squeamish this movie may not be one of your favorites.

Why Oh Why can't Hollywood just make a good movie.,"OK, this is my type of movie. So why did I despise the director for making it, how could he waste so much of a good thing, lack so much common sense, live in such degradation, and ruin such a plot?So, I read other commentaries to see if I'm psycho. It seems I'm not alone, there are others, very bitter and disappointed.I thought Law was supposed to be good, well he is, so why waste it?Kidman begins to shine, you start to feel her character, and she is loosing that, I'm a cold bitch look, I could fall for her now, but wasted character.Well Renée? We've got to love her for this part, she was having fun and so was I. She did well despite the likely best parts on the cutting room floor.A supporting cast? Whow!, long list of wonderful character and characters that filled the basket even fuller, but the production scattered it all to the wind. No matter how well they did, it was an impossible task of bringing it all back together.Where does this creative crew live? The dark side? With no personal fortitude, no faith? The whole world sh-ts on them? Life's not worth living? Then, what a cheep shot for and ending scene, there is no redemption in guilt. Do a good job in the first place. Something more than Ruby should have shined.When having something good, it should have been building plot and character, but it quit cold, when it should quit and move on, it dragged on, then came back and threw in more.

For whatever reason, Hollywood still hasn't seemed to figure out that NOT every good book has to be made into a film. In fact it rarely works, particularly with this Minghella dude at the helm. There was absolutely no chemistry between Law and Kidman, the accents were incredibly poor and ruined any semblance of authenticity, memorable dialogue was completely deleted for no apparent reason whatsoever, and... I could go on and on. In short, it had none of the heart, wit, beauty, and charm of the novel. It amounted to little more than another big budget ""epic"" that might as well have been called ""Hey!

"Despite attractive leading characters, it was a disappointment.","I go to the cinema infrequently these days.  I love the old movies, but I am usually disappointed by the chase-them, bed-them, blow-them-up approach taken by so many of our current movie makers.  Advertisements for ""Cold Mountain"" managed to conquer my trepidation.  It seemed that  finally we were going to be given a real old-fashioned romance along with a bit of history.  I regret to say that it was a disappointment.There was romance, of course.  I found the main story line of star-crossed lovers very appealing, and I thought that the lead actors carried it off very well.  They were attractive and generally convincing.  Also, the supporting cast was excellent, the cinematography was outstanding, and the director did a good job of depicting the horrors and sadness of war, both in battle and on the home front.  As a student of history, however, I must say that historical accuracy did not enter into it.  Perhaps this was also true of the novel.  Since I have not read it, I cannot say.The way this story is presented, the Home Guard was nore of a threat to the Southern civilian population than the Union Army.  This, of course, is utter nonsense.  The Home Guard was made up of men too old or too young to serve in the army, and its primary mission was home defense -- not hunting down deserters and shooting them on sight.  In reality, the aim of Confederate officials was to return deserters to their units in condition to fight -- not as cadavers.At the time our fictional hero was trying to make his way back home to the North Carolina mountains (in the winter of 1864-5), there were deserters all over the South, especially in areas of strong pro-union sentiment such the Southern highlands.  Also there were thousands of former Confederate soldiers who had been seriously wounded in the fighting and invalided out of service.  Under these conditions, does one think that a man like Teague, along with his murderous companions, could have terrorized and entire county for months on end?  But the lack of historical accuracy is not my main problem with the movie.  After all, when do you go to the cinema expecting an accurate portrayal of an historical event?  Like most people, I go principally for entertainment.  On that level, my real problem with this movie is some of the excessive non-battlefield violence and the graphic sexual encounter that is depicted at one point in the movie.  That sexual scene was gross, unnecessary, and over the top.  It made be embarrassed to be in the theater, and I was embarrassed for the actresses who had to bare their breasts and bottoms to make the scene.",6.0,Anonymous,History
beautiful story but has credibility stretch,"I thought this was a beautiful and strong story with excellent performances by the entire cast. In one instance I thought believability was stretched for the sake of a dramatic moment, but forgivable for the otherwise flawless film that this is.Renee Zellweger delivers what I think is her best performance. Kidman is stunning as the belle who has to learn to manage on her own. Her frustration at her upbringing which has made her a ""refined lady"" but almost useless in the harsh times the war brings comes across and really helps the viewer see her as a whole person. She easily have been a very flat character only serving to move along the plot for the others (unfortunately many female so-called leads are written that way)--but is not.This film is able to pull many different emotions as the characters struggle. Since historical epics are coming around like TROY and now KINGDOM OF HEAVEN, this one is great as a short epic of the ending of the Civil War for many of the same reasons the Odyssey was of the Trojan War.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Pointless degradation,"There are good moments and scenes in this film: when the lovers eventually get together, when Ruby gives the farm the once-over, when deserters and farm women share a small hoedown, and when Inman carefully shares a bed with a woman who has lost her husband. For the most part, though, the movie moves from pointless gore to meaningless degradation, scene after scene. I understand very well that there are times and places in which that's what life mostly is. And if this movie were an exception to an overload of happy films, who could object? But it is not. It is simply the dramatization of suffering for the purpose of making the rich richer. And we already have plenty of that.",6.0,Anonymous,History
The look of Nicole Kidman...,"I didn't watch The English Patient, so I can't talk about it; but I did watch Talented Mr. Ripley and it seemed to me that Minghella  an elegant filmmaker, sober and perfectionist, and an excellent actors director. Now, Cold Mountain corroborates all those qualities. He's adapted to the big screen a classic love story set in USA's Civil War, where a refining girl (Nicole Kidman) has to  face up to poverty and to the absence of her beloved one (Jude Law), who's gone to fight in the War. The movie has two main lines: Kidman's character's evolution from a well educated and respectable girl to a farmer; and the oddyssey of Jude Law to come back to her from the battlefield.Ok, the story is nothing extraordinary, there're plenty of movies in the same line (starting by that icon called Gone With The Wind); but there's only one Anthony Minghella. He looks after every detail, he lavish care every sequence, every shot. Photography is just spectacular, and so are the locations. Wardrobe and soundtrack are just nice.Since Cold Mountain is based on a novel (just like Talented Ripley -and English Patient I guess-), the narrative style is rather literary, with a voice over and such well cared dialogues. Maybe Anthony Minghella's biggest defect is that he takes pleasure in every scene, in every view, in every look, and that makes his movies a little too long, and a little slow sometimes. He seems to be incapable of making a 90 minutes movie.As for the cast, well, this is the very strong point of Cold Mountain. Nicole Kidman shines so bright, and she demonstrates that her talent seems to have no limits (maybe it's nothing to do with it, but since she divorced Tom Cruise she has incredible grown as an actress, so much so that she's become the best actress from his generation). Also her beauty is remarkable, she's more beautiful now than when she was 25 or 30. No doubt she's the most memorable thing in Cold Mountain. I'm not much of a Jude Law's fan, I think he's quite unexpressive, and without many registers, but maybe a more histrionic actor wouldn't have fit the character. I don't know much about american accents, but it seems to me that Mrs. Zellweger makes a good job imitating an accent that's not her natural one (and she takes charge of the funny points in CM -that's something she sure knows how to do-). There's also an impressive team of supporting actors: Donald Sutherland, Eileen Atkins, Brendan Gleeson, Natalie Portman, Giovanni Ribisi, Philip Seymour Hoffman ... a top quality cast.One of the best Hollywood pictures from 2003. A wise way of spending the money from the Studios.My rate: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History

what one would expect from a good Hollywood movie,"'Cold Mountain' is a big studio epic, and a good one for a change. All elements of a successful creation of this kind are in place - a good historic theme, super-stars casting, good cinema (much was filmed in location in Romania) , and a message that is beyond the plot, and makes the film worth watching. The message is about the vanity of war, the conflict between love and man's brutality, the will of the human beings to love and survive despite the wish of their leaders to push them to war one against the other. It's an actual theme today as well, unfortunately.What the viewer gets is a good cinema treatment, a superb war scene at the beginning of the film setting the background and providing Law's character motivation for the rest of the movie, and very good acting from Renée Zellweger. I was slightly disappointed by Jude Law and Nicole Kidman. Each of them was good, but not at their best, and they never showed up the radiant chemistry of a true great love story as they should have. A full world of good supporting characters and solid cinematography re-create the world of the American civil war in a fresh way, despite the many other memorable film stories inspired by those times.It's what you expect. Nothing less, maybe a bit more. 8 our of 10 on my personal scale.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Very moving,"I really enjoyed this movie, and was quite surprised to see so many negative comments posted here.  I thought everyone in the cast did a fantastic job. I was especially moved by the depth of emotion presented by both Nicole Kidman and Jude Law.  It was heart-wrenching and touching.  I really enjoyed the comic moments with Renee Zellweger and Philip Seymour Hoffman.  They were hilarious!I would recommend this movie if you're in the mood for a deeply touching love story.  It's kind of violent and gory in some scenes, but such were the times during the civil war.  I thought this was very well done and it's well worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Zellweger great performance,"Jude Law is Inman, who falls in love with Ada Monroe (Kidman) prior to being sent to fight for the South in the American Civil War. When he is seriously injured, Inman is determined to leave the frontline and return home to Cold Mountain. Ada Monroe is battling the freezing winter and it's not until Ruby Thews (Zellweger) comes to her aid that she begins to survive and await the return of Inman.While everyone accepts that war is brutal, it was the portrayal of the cruelty and viciousness inflicted on those left behind that was captivating and thought provoking.

Oscar Bait no Bite,"I had to see this movie after I heard the Hype how this movies was ""the second coming of movies"", that this was the to beat movie of the oscar season.  Going to see this was a BIG MISTAKE, this movie was Mediocre on all levels and NO Nicole Kidman really fumbles this part unable to nail down her accent she was portraying.  A movie about the civil war?  Yeah right you could have used any war to pass this movie off.  I was a sappy love story on-screen never read the book so I wont say anything about the book, but what was put to screen was horrible.  Why is Natalie Portman even credited as to having a BIG role when she doesnt she it just a bit part, somewhat moving but only 10 or min of screen time, what happend it was a name that they could add to the budget they could afford.  The movie just wasnt that good and dont let anyone tell you, you have to be in love to enjoy it no you dont I am and I still didnt like it.  This movie is overrated by all means, this was just the big tragic love story of the year.  I have restored faith in the Oscars again that this didnt get the big nomination, I can accept Jude Law's nomination this is the second movie I have seen him in that he didnt annoy me, acting wise.  This movie's advertising proved you shouldnt count on a sure thing Oscar bid and sweep, cause it didnt.  In closing this is a renter I give it a C- at best.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Cold Mountain unfaithful to the book,"I had read the book before seeing the movie, and also listened to the unabridged audio book read by the author. I found it's story astounding. But the movie....it became a discombobulated contortion right before my eyes.Ada was a brunette, and a snotty little uppity-chick from Charleston whose sole intent at times seemed to be shoving people away, or saying something outrageous just to shock those within earshot. Inman and Ada knew of each other, but their encounters were few. Inman told Sally Swanger that he'd ""clear an acre of new ground for an introduction..."" to Ada. After the intro, there was little said, with Inman finding himself lost for words and staring down into his hat. Ada asked if that collection of ""dullards"" had put him up to it, and ask how he thought it was going. Inman said ""...like picking up a chestnut burr, thus far."" The book is far more satisfying, and far more of a look into the characters of Ada and Ruby, and Inman, and Sally and Esco, and all the other rich characters.The movie is a swill-trough of poorly matched character-representations, all due to a poorly written script and simple-minded attempt to capitalize on a truly extraordinary novel.Rene Z. should have been allowed to purchase the rights also, so she could make a semi-faithful MINI-SERIES that would actually allow the audience to see how Ada's coming into her own (from a socialite to a ""person"" of substance) shaped her into a much better person, with Ruby's guidance and ""foot in the back"".I'm still bummed out about how this wonderful story was so recklessly mangled....",,Anonymous,History
Most overrated film of 2003,"This movie was just flat out disappointing. I love every actor in it (Save Jack White, who's White Stripes are the biggest travesty in music today), and you have to love the sweeping romance epic angle, but this movie was just...meh. It reminded me of a really really beautifully shot adaptation of a trashy romance novel. In the first hour the dialouge is flat out terrible. Revolting even. Jude Law was excellent as always but my god, Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger hurt me. The supporting cast saved the movie, Portman was wonderful, Gleason and Hoffman as always were excellent. But for the most part I was just sitting there wondering how this movie was nominated for 8 Golden Globes, or any for that matter. Maybe it's because I saw 21 Grams earlier in the day for the first time. This movie did not even make my top 10 for the year, no where close. It will be a joke if this wins Best Picture, just like Chicago was last year. I know it will be nominated for sure, but it really should not be.

Very Dramatic movie with lots of violence.,"This movie was very dramatic. A great performance from Jude Law, and Renee Zelweger. I think Nicole Kidman was a bit over the top. An appearance from Jack White of the band The White Stripes appears as Georgia, a fiddle playing band mate of Rudy's(zelweger) father. If a dramatic love story with a war tie in is what you crave, this is the movie for you. But there is much death and blood, and drinking, and major violence. It is not for the weak of heart. Definitely a movie that was really worked on, but its long like the lord of the rings, and i got a bit bored in the middle once nothing was happening, the end is where the most productive events happen. The ending is sweet and sad at the same time. See it for yourself and post here your views. see if you agree with me.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A brilliant display of emotions in war time with a different angle,"The film starts with the voice of Nicole kidman as ADA and the voice alone promised a lot. And to start with the complete movie I say a very nicely written screenplay and some very fine performances that I had recently seen. There were some moments in the starting when I felt sleepy but as the story progressed it started to show that it is a promising film. A girl saw a boy and both felt in love secretly with each. This might not be a new formula but was well made into a completely nice movie. The girl has to wait for the boy to return from the war. How the relationship got so close is the only part where something more had to be explored but nevertheless after that the movie picked up its pace and didn't made me feel like a time waste. Jude law is always good no doubt but I had never seen Nicole kidman performing so nicely. A completely new side had been explored in the movie regarding what a girl would do when she is waiting for someone in a war time. Many movies related to war been made and there are only a few who touch a completely different aspect and this movie made me remember of The Pianist. The things going on in the girl's life while waiting for her man were good. Another aspect was a number of twists at all times. The way they pictured the difficulties on his way home were very nice. Also when Ruby got in the movie everything seemed much smarter and interesting. She rightfully got the academy award for the best supportive role.VERDICT: ""A must watch film.""",10.0,Anonymous,History
The stars are the weak points,"""Cold Mountain"" - a movie that you can watch.Script: tight, if you can mentally insert the ""Years later..."" card between a few scene cuts, and I know you can. A few Oscar-bait monologues are clunky in that adapted-from-the-novel way... but that's just me, I like to be shown rather than told by a character what they're going through.Production design: convincing, believable, with that old movie-magic feeling of being a window into the way people lived oh so long ago and far away... (though when Kidman walks in front of it, the jarring incongruity jumps out that, despite her partial grime-over, there simply were no women as pretty as Nicole Kidman 140 years ago. Squinty-eyed pout-machine Zellweger looks more like Appalachian mountain breeding stock.)Cinematography: Amazing. Everything has the natural light look - absolutely absorbing. One of the most beautiful winter snow scenes ever filmed.Story: Good Guys good, Bad Guys bad... with their character conflict/resolutions built right in. A series of long, protracted tragedies you don't have to see comin' round the mountain when they come. But still, the familiar crudeness and cruelty of events have that original-source feel - when life was more of the hardscrabble scrape than the dreamworld we live in.Casting: Ahhhhh... this is where the movie both succeeds and fails.It's mostly inspired. Jude Law and Brendan Gleeson are very good... no, they're excellent.The character actors are all first-rate - I mean, you could SMELL the backwoods witch goat-lady.Jack White does a fine understated job, though I found it impossible to stop seeing Jack White and thinking how cool it was that Jack White was in this movie, and wondering if Jack White was really playing his instrument.(It couldn't have been more amazing if his character's name was ""Jack White"" too - I mean, that even sounds like the name of a traveling mountain musician. Anyhow, the point is it kind of breaks the spell. )And Philip Seymore Hoffman is good in anything.But this movie belongs to Ray Winstone. His Confederate villain is more than just menacing. He's got the violence of battlefield madness in his quiet voice. (Can you believe he's British ? His Southern accent wasn't just convincing, it was FLAWLESS, something that even American-born Yankees can't manage.)I know villains never get For Your Consideration treatment - but this one should've instead offfffffffff..... (*drum roll*)ZELLWEGER-MANIA !She won award after award for this. People gushed about how great she was as the comic relief. Hm. I didn't find anything she said or did particularly comic. And I could spend a little while detailing why she shouldn't have all those awards. Cause Renée Zellweger stinks.Her accent is inconsistent and drawling - it's Appalachian mountain folk accent, Renée, not Savannah, not 'Bama, not Texas or Nawlinz... Study the dialect tapes, honey. Amazingly, she's up against British, Australian, and Irish lead actors, and yet her accent is the weakest. Maybe that's why she kept changing her mind about it as the movie progressed. (Do like Kidman does - pick one wrong accent, and stick with it.)Zellweger plays her character with three emotions - mad, madder, and wounded-&-mad. But it's not the bitter anger of a young woman whose life has already let her down and had to come up fighting - it's more like the pouting petulance of a teenager who spends most of the day brooding cause she's mad at her mom. She's so ADORABLE when she pouts ! Oh no, her pouting is out of control ! Ha ha, oh, Renée !How does Zellweger keep getting work ? Beats me. I wonder if her British affectation is any more convincing.Who would've been better in this role ? Oh, I could say something cruel like, ""Hold an open casting call and throw a rock.""But instead, let me ask who might have been a WORSE casting choice for Renée Zellweger's role. The answer springs immediately to mind: Winona Rider. An only slightly worse choice.Also, it seems Nicole Kidman is in the movie. ""Cold Mountain"" may have originally been a vehicle for her. I like Kidman, and she's done good work elsewhere; it's just that this was just not a standout role for her. Next to the wailing klaxon horn of Zellweger's acting, Kidman seems merely to perform adequately. And again, it doesn't help that she's just too Hollywood-pretty for the part.Truthfully, both female leads could've been cast better. Because the other issue is that not for a MOMENT did I believe that Jude Law's and Nicole Kidman's characters were attracted to each other.Sting, who used to be a rock and roll singer, wrote the theme song that uses the word ""ain"" in the title, which just gives me Reason #98 to want to kick him in the *ss. But I can't fault the movie's music at all. Good score, great sound.So there you go. ""Cold Mountain."" A movie that you can watch.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Great Movie,"The creators of this movie took the time to make this movie as realistic to the times as possible. EXCEPT, I do not believe Nicole Kidman was the appropriate person for the role she played. Nicole Kidman does not have the appearance of a sympathetic character and tried too hard in her role. Despite Ms. Kidman's performance, the movie and the rest of the actors were wonderful. I would definitely watch this movie again. This movie is more of a romance mixed in with occasional action. The one really bad part of the movie is that the role of the bad guys is deeply overplayed and too predictable. The movie would have been better if these bad guys made hardly any appearances until the end. I don't know if the position of these bad guys is historically accurate, but it did not seem very believable.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"""A Tale from the Home Land""","The movie Cold Mountain takes place during the Civil War and focuses primarily on a town in North Carolina called Cold Mountain. Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) comes to Cold Mountain with her father, Reverend Veasey (Philip Seymour Hoffman) from Charleston. Ada quickly catches the eye of a young man by the name of Inman (Jude Law), but is too shy to tell him her true feelings about him. Soon enough the war has begun and Inman is called to go off to war; and now she is left to deal with her feelings for Inman bottled up and hoping that he comes home from the war. And if matter couldn't get worse Ada looses her father a year later and has nobody to lean on for support. So she is forced to work and live off of the land; and along with what little values that she had left to her name. Almost starved to death and worn down, Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger) comes to Ada's rescue. Ruby teaches Ada how to work and live off of the land and teaches Ada what life is truly like -- hard and unfair. Years have passed and the war is still going and Ada has no idea how Inman is or where he is. But her heart is still with him. Meanwhile, Inman is faced with the hardships of war, wounded and determined to find his way back to the beauty of Cold Mountain and into the arms of Ada.Director Anthony Minghella intentions of the movie are: 1,) He wanted his audience to get a realistic view as to what women had to overcome when the men were off at war; 2,) Soldiers' family and 'sweethearts' is what kept them going and sane during the war. With all of the blood, guts, and death that soldiers had to see everyday the memories of their loved ones help them to survive.I would consider this movie to be one of the best Civil War movies because it is set in another point of view -- the women at Cold Mountain. Cold Mountain focused mainly on what was going on back home. And that is what I thought was one of the best parts of the movie. Many civil war movies are depicted from the soldiers at war; but here the audience sees what is going on back home.",,Anonymous,History
An Amazing Cast!,"I have never bothered to watch this movie as I'm not much of a Jude Law fan, and the thought of him an movie almost three hours long about the civil war did not appeal to this reviewer, even with the always reliable Brendon Gleason, Giovanni Ribbsi, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Natalie Portman and Donald Sutherland in the supporting cast. Not to mention Nicole Kidman and an Oscar winning turn by Renee Zellweger. But it was on TV tonight and in the absence of anything else to watch, I gave it a go, and boy am I glad I did.Plot In A Paragraph: A wounded Confederate soldier named Inman (Law) who struggles on a perilous journey to get back home to Cold Mountain, to his sweetheart Ada (Kidman) the woman he left behind before going off to fight in the Civil War. Along the way, he meets a long line of interesting and colourful characters.Every actor I have listed gives a good if not great performance. Portman stands out in her small role, whilst Seymour Hoffman reminds us what a talent we have lost.Zellweger deservedly won the Oscar for her work here, Kidman may have been aggrieved that her work was over shadowed by her costar. As she too is superb, and was rightly nominated for a golden globe, but their was an academy award snub for some reason. For some reason I found the love scene with Law awkward to watch too. Weird. I didn't even find Jude Law as annoying as normal and he picked up an Oscar nomination.There are several problems with it, but not enough to ruin the movie. Definitely worth checking out.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"A Very Good, Almost Great, War Drama","I have been waiting for the release of Cold Mountain for more than a year, and eagerly attended the first showing on opening day.  My interest was based upon the Civil War theme and my respect for Minghella, Law, Kidman and Zelwegger.  My expectations were largely met, but there were aspects of the film that came up just a little short.What was great about Cold Mountain?  As Ruby (Zelwegger) would say, Number one-  the cinematography.  The initial battle scenes were astonishingly realistic and inspiring.  I have not seen such splendid reenactment since Glory (a favorite film).  Number two- the authentic costumes and set design. Number three- Jude Law's perfectly understated characterization of a war-weary Inman.  Number four- Renee Zelwegger's delightful portrayal of Ruby.  Number five- Nicole Kidman's beauty and grace.All of these splendid facets made this a superior film.  There are a few small details that detracted from its greatness, and here's my short list: number one- the location shooting in Romania works 70% of the time, but the extremely high, sheer-faced and snow-capped mountains are not typical of North Carolina.  number two- the instant attraction of Inman to Ada is part of the plot but needed to be developed just a little more to make the separation more meaningful to the viewer.  number three- being no prude, I have no real objection to nude scenes but they seemed unnecessary in this Victorian-era romance.  Leigh and Gable didn't need to flash breasts and buttocks to make it clear they were about to have intercourse when Rhett swept Scarlett up the staircase in GWTW.  number four- what's with all the animal mutilation? people have to eat but for goodness sake, there's a bull sawed into pieces, a rooster head yanked off and a cute little goat's neck is slashed.  PETA members, be warned. number five (and last)- Civil War history buffs know that the vast majority of casualties at 'the crater' caused at Petersburg were African Americans but this is not evident in the opening battle scene.Overall, Cold Mountain was a terrific dramatic film and certainly deserves the accolades it has received.  I cast an early set of votes for upcoming Oscars as follows:  Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Cinematography, Screenplay, Direction, Costume.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Misery Mountain,"Adapted from the much-loved novel by Charles Frazier, `Cold Mountain' has been a welcome arrival to the big screen. Acclaimed director/screenwriter Anthony Minghella, thankfully, has taken on the responsibility of bringing forth the tangled story of love and war to a visual reality. May it be war on an epic scale or war on a personal level Minghella knows precisely how to capture the moment. And even with the abundance of splendid scene-scapes and backdrops spread throughout the film the key achievement `Cold Mountain' exhibits is the emotion and passion harnessed within the characters.Clearly the heart of the story is one that viewers are more than familiar with. Hope, loss and love, all up against overwhelming odds, it's hardly original. But, you will find satisfaction by being able to identify with the emotional quandary of these characters. Once you get to know them you slip into the story and enjoy yourself all the more. But Minghella has some trouble getting you there. The movie starts off slowly as exposition and character development is needed to boost the rest of the film. It's all stuff that is essentially needed but it's just a little dreary at times. On top of that the need to get closer to true history means that the tone gets quite depressing. This is only strengthened by the characters who the majority are driven by a sad coating of misery, sin or defeat in their lives. Then add the Confederacy losing the war and you don't have a very happy place to be. Make no mistake about it Minghella has made a serious drama with a somewhat relaxed momentum in the telling. But if it's authenticity that he wanted then he has done a marvelous job. It's just that, in this case, reality can really bring you down.Performances are all A-class. The two leads, Nicole Kidman as Ada and Jude Law as Inman, are truly great actors. The roles themselves are not the best we've seen but they work well within context of the story. Renée Zellweger's character, Ruby, strikes a sudden change to the pace and grim guise the rest of the movie holds. I found myself liking all of Ruby's scenes but am still trying to figure out if it's because she's the inversion of an overly dim film or because she just sticks out like a sore thumb. Either way I think the film would have probably fell completely stagnate if it weren't for Zellweger's lively portrayal.`Cold Mountain' is not exactly Anthony Minghella's greatest effort but definitely one of his finest. This is a great story made with tremendous care by a large handful of master filmmakers. It's a little bleak and sluggish for most of the time but done in reflection to the literary source and the authenticity of the story. Ironically, it's hard to imagine it done in any other way. Despite some minor announces you will have a hard time not enjoying yourself. In the end this is a good entertaining few hours. I'd even go as far as saying it's a must see film, because you really must see it to make your own judgment.Score - 3 out of 5",7.0,Anonymous,History

Epic film-making of the highest caliber,"As the dust clears and the rumor mills are finally silenced, it is time to acknowledge Anthony Minghella's Cold Mountain in a separate light from the tiresome and repeated scandals that surrounded its production. The film finally surfaces on both sides of the Atlantic conveniently in time for Oscar consideration, and the nods of recognition from the Academy must surely follow will be richly deserved. This is a wonderful movie, executed to perfection in both performance and direction and a fine example of epic film-making of the highest caliber.The narrative tells the story of a man known simply as Inman, played by Jude Law, who deserts his position at the front of the American Civil War in order to return to Nicole Kidman's Ada, his true love who stayed behind. The story splits its concern between the two characters as Inman continues his odyssey across war torn America and Ada undergoes a transformation of her own. Both Law and Kidman are excellent in their roles but the real revelation here is Renee Zellweger, whose performance breathes new life into the movie whenever it shows signs of flagging.It is a good job that the central figures do perform to the highest of their ability because the film is so packed with talent, any weak showing would be quickly overshadowed. It is hard to recall in recent times a movie that employs so many actors at the top of their game, even when playing cameo roles. Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Giovanni Ribisi and especially Natalie Portman all threaten to steal the scenes they share with a bewildered but single minded Inman.Complaints are few and minor, with the only major misjudgment occurring in an ill conceived and distastefully executed whore house scene. Some viewers may also find it hard to empathise with a romantic pairing that is given so little screen time to develop, and it is true that Inman and Ada develop very strong feelings in a short space of time. It is as Inman's hand that the explanation for this is found though as he clutches a photograph of Ada throughout. When war changes the world perspective around him, one image and one glimpse is all the motivation he needs.Cold Mountain is a riveting film that remains brutally true to its source material, and though this does make for a rather relentlessly bleak experience, it is refreshing to witness a director fully in control of his craft. Minghella has produced one of the best films of the year, an achievement that deserves to be assessed apart from its accompanying gossip.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Give COLD MOUNTAIN  the Cold Shoulder,"What a lousy, boring picture.Jude Law was horribly miscast in this civil war yarn. Nicole Kidman pulls out all the stops to emulate Scarlett O'Hara but does not and Renee Zellwegger gives a performance that I quite did not understand.

That combined with her southern drawl made her impossible to understand.Can't fathom that Kathy Baker recovered so quickly following the horrible massacre of her husband and sons. They ought to use Miss Baker as a grieving counselor in a public high school. Nice job of getting back to yourself quickly, Miss Baker, but it was inappropriate.Jude Law appeared to be able to survive anything in this grim civil war tale.

"Typically Hollywood, but pretty good","Good flick. Interesting story. Good adaption to screenplay.Somewhat predictable but not overly so. Played on lots of ridiculous stereotypes of southerners. On the upside, it least made an attempt to show good and bad characters on both sides, though this isn't exactly the same thing as accuracy. Southern accents were woefully off, particularly Kidman's.I rented this movie not fully expecting to like it. Hollywood flicks that try to capitalize on historically events usually suck in lots of ways.They often play on historical stereotypes. Second, they frequently insert fictional love interests and other stock story lines into the lives of historical figures. This was fictional to begin with, and not being a Civil War history buff, I'm not aware of any distortions. This film's plays on stereotypes weren't among the worst that I've seen.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A starkly beautiful film of great emotional impact,"Nicole Kidman and Jude Law are two of the most beautiful people on the planet, so it shouldn't be difficult to understand why many critics are praising this film. Watching the emotions play upon their nearly perfect features is mesmerizing. Did any Confederate soldier really have teeth this good? Impressive performances by both leads (particularly Kidman's range) and a stellar cast bring this Civil War tragedy to a higher level. Brendan Gleeson and Philip Hoffman are wonderful. Natalie Portman is so convincing and heart-wrenching that one has to wonder what narcotics George Lucas had her on in Star Wars Episodes I and II. I will say that the opening battle scene was a huge disappointment. The choppy cuts and camera movement meant to give the documentary feel doesn't work here. The reason it worked so well in Spielberg's WWII era films (""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Schindler's List"") is because there were actual gun cameras, footage of combat and newsreel documentary footage as a frame of reference. The film feels gritty and authentic in all other respects. Excellent suspense is maintained up through the rewarding and mature climax.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Wow.,"This film is absolutely spectacular. It fulfills everything; drama, lust, romance, passion, love, war. Passion, in every form is portrayed throughout this film and I have been left in complete awe at how touching this film is. Heartache and desperation is also portrayed and if you have a soft spot for romance this will anchor that and really hit a nerve (in the best possible way). Slow starting perhaps for some, but after the first hour I was completely hooked, as the film ended I was left in awe and admiration for not only the storyline but the wonderful performance by ALL actors involved in this film as well as the beautiful choice of music to go alongside each chapter of the film. It's a must see and I can't recommend it enough.",9.0,Anonymous,History
The movie deeply moved my heart,"The movie amazingly displays the time period of the Civil War, showing the great scene of the giant explosion that started the Battle of Crater in part of Siege of Petersburg as the opening scene into the movie. Just with this horrific scene of the war, it brought me the feelings of terror and the visions of the war that I could never imagine. It got me absorbed into the movie quickly. Throughout the movie, it provided us the hardships that the main characters, as well as the people that lived through the war, had to survive in. The film not only conveyed one perspective during these terrifying times, it showed us a woman's point of view and what they had endured when the men had to live for war. Additionally, the film portrayed the scenes of the war very well with appropriate attire and choice of music. The director, Anthony Minghella gave the realities of the battles that men were forced to face, for instance, some of the Yankee soldiers were treated brutality. Nevertheless, this film is originally on two lovers (Inman and Ada) that longed for another and hoped to reunite since the Civil War brought them apart.It's a tragic story that both Ada and Inman only have memories of each other to rely on. Also, in the film there were symbols displayed to foreshadow the outcomes of the couples. It was very interesting to connect the dots and predict the outcomes, which I was not expecting.Briefly, the movie overall was excellent. Not only did it showed the battles that one could not imagine except to those who experienced war. Jude Law and Nicole Kidman both played their character very well. Law portrayed as Inman, a young man that was very considerate and shy that lived in Cold Mountain (NC) while Kidman was Ada that was forced to mature as her father died. This movie had made a great impact on me and I would highly recommend this, however, to those who are very emotional be prepare to cry.",9.0,Anonymous,History
This movie carries high morality values,"The movie it's about two lovers Nicole kidman and Jude Law separated by war and fighting to get back together against all odds . The dialog of the movie is well thought and poetic and the acting is brilliant. This movie carries high morality values. It challenges lovers who are far from each other that distance is not an excuse to cheat on your loved one. We see this through the main two characters lovers Nicole kidman and Jude Law who are presented with the opportunities to compromise, to give in to comfort zones but remain outstanding even though those that we expect high morality values from are compromising.This movies really shows what loves is all about Patience , Sacrifice. I strongly recommend it if you have a distance relationship and finding it challenging to remain faithful this is the movie for you to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Solid leads enhanced by an outstanding supporting cast.,"As Nicole Kidman walks across the screen towards Jude Law, the question remains; where is the chemistry? As solid and thoughtful both actors portray Ada and Inman individually, together their love just doesn't seem believable. Law's limited expression doesn't benefit his character's myriad of emotions, and Kidman, though slightly more realistic, conveys, at best, a weak and fragile woman lost in depression. Despite these few faults, both the leads create the tone and mood of the film to be one of despair and depression, amidst all of the feelings of love.What makes Cold Mountain special is the supporting cast. Natalie Portman enrichens the screen as the wife of a soldier. While delivering her script with raw austerity, she also enhances Law's presence with her compassionate and understanding person, despite the turmoil surrounding her. Giovanni Ribisi also shines in his role, offering a believable and realistic role in the time of war.But it is here that Renee Zellweger shines. The minute Ruby appears to Ada, the movie changes it's monotony and depression to one with depth and even excitement. The way Zellweger shapes Ruby's personality towards her surroundings is a stark portrayal of strong women during war. Her Oscar is only a testament to one of the most captivating and intelligent performances of the 21st Century, rivalled only by Charlize Theron's portrayal of Aileen Wuornos.Ultimately, Cold Mountain depicts the solid leads enhanced by one of the greatest supporting cast ever to be assembled in a movie.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Very dissapointing,"I had such high expectations for this film, but I guess you should never expect anything from something you have no idea about or weren't a part of. This movie was one of the biggest wastes of time I've ever had to sit through. The storyline was very boring and was always dragging along. It's a shame that so many movies are being put together just because of a few good actors, and a somewhat ""interesting"" surrounding. As I said before, this movie was a total dissapointment.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Moving away from violence to love,"I feel that ""Cold Mountain"" not getting more recognition- box office or award- is a shame(at least Renee Zellweger won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress). To me this movie was excellent in all departments: terrific acting, epic cinematography and set design, and above all else a meaningful story.As director Anthony Minghella says on the DVD commentary track, this movie is about the virus of violence, how violence is spread like a disease-the innocent have violent acts committed against them and in turn become violent themselves-. Moving away from violence toward what makes life worth living(love)is the journey that Inman is on.Cudos to all involved, as well as to Charles Frazier for penning the novel that was the basis for the film.In closing, a movie that deserves much more credit and praise then it has received; well-worth watching.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Wonderful heartache,"Judging from the plethora of comments I've seen in the message board, there are lots of folks that loved and hated this movie. I could not have hated it, and not because I am located in the south.I think that Nicole Kidman and Jude Law were perfect for these roles. The romance that the previews promised turned into a longing that I felt with every bit of the woman I am, but it didn't really disappoint me that it wasn't exactly as much a romance as I felt I was led to believe. I hadn't seen or read much about the movie before I saw it, and I'm glad. It was mostly a big surprise all around.Renee Zellweger may just be the actress that stole the movie, but then I think she does that with every movie she appears in. I'll say she was an addition that kept it from becoming morose, for sure. Thankfully she added a bit of wit, whimsy, down home country feelings, which are very much a part of any southern home. Her brutally honest presence in Ada's life gave a feeling of security, even when she was being sarcastic which is often. *smile*The war scenes were difficult to watch and seeing the desperate men that did their best to return home only to be shot down by the home guard hurt... because even though I understand their need to encourage loyalty to the confederacy, surely they had to realize that it was quite fruitless to kill that which you needed so badly - able bodied men! I cannot understand this part of history - meaning, I do not see what benefit it gave the confederacy, and may very well have been one of the reasons the south lost that war so pitifully. So many men deserted that were shot rather than rehabilitated.Anyway, I thought Donald Sutherland was wonderful in his brief role, and think he always lends a classy air to any movie. The ending was bittersweet... the waiting, looking and watching, hoping and praying they both did ended differently than I'd thought it would.I would buy this one and recommend it to anyone. Whether you like it or not is up to you, but I loved it and so did my husband.",9.0,Anonymous,History
what an ending !!!!,"Cold mountain is definitely a must see movie. Set during the civil war, we see a love story between Ada and Inman. (Great cast, by the way... Kidman played a beautiful Ada and Law.. a sensitive Inman.) We also see how the lovers were separated by the war, how the war destroyed Inman's spirit and the only thing that kept him alive was his desire to get back to Ada. Ada in the meantime, had to grow up the hard way after her father died. Then enter Rene Zellweger's character, Ruby. I must admit without Ruby's character in the movie, it (the movie) would've been rather boring.Ladies .... prepare a box of tissues for the ending ! You won't see it coming until you realise that tears are rolling down your cheeks !",8.0,Anonymous,History
Definitely worth a look.,"I haven't seen this film for about a year, but something brought it to mind. I decided to browse the comments here and am most surprised, especially by some of the negative ones.Two of the most laughable are that a) Jude Law's acting performance was very wooden and b) there are two many non-American actors in the film.a) Jude Law IS one of the most wooden actors ever, and in my view is normally dreadful in all that he does. However, in this film his character, Inman, is one of the most dull individuals ever realised on film, and Law is ideally cast as the shy, boring, monosyllabic carpenter. He fitted the role perfectly.b) What the critics who moan about the use of non-American actors forget is that the USA is a land of immigrants, and that the likelihood of people speaking with a not quite perfect 'southern' accent was very high in the melting pot of the 19th century. Granted, I don't suppose that there were too many Australian immigrants ;), but that shouldn't be held against Ms Kidman who does a fine job with most parts that she takes on.The film itself? It is not the greatest thing since sliced bread that some people believe, neither is it the boring rubbish described by others. I found it an engrossing story that, although episodic, held my attention for the whole two and a half hours. The story was well told and visually it looked good; the only reservation I have is that of the character played by Ray Winstone, which grated somewhat.Overall, well worth seeing. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Torture.  Slow Torture.,"Another tiresome bore from Anthony Minghella, who seems to thrive on these big bloated super-productions that take over two and a half hours to do what any reasonable filmmaker would do in about ninety minutes.The story centers on Inman (a somnambulent Jude Law), who goes off to the Civil War having just barely started a sort-of romance with Nicole Kidman, a Preacher's Daughter who has recently arrived in the prettily photographed backwater town.  The story cuts back and forth between Inman's trials and tribulations at war (which is, guess what boys and girls? HELL!!) and Kidman's trials and tribulations back at home (which are, very predictably, incredibly boring).  Renee Zellwegger appears on Kidman's farm to help Kidman get it back into shape after Kidman's saintly Daddy dies of Inconvenient Character Disease.  Zellwegger acts all squinty and bossy in that Granny Clampett kind of way, dispensing enough Tough Love and Homespun Wisdom to turn the stomach of even the hardiest watcher of Touched By An Angel.This film is, quite simply, excruciating.

Fine film,"Many, many comments here.  Some good, many bad.  Zellweger steals the show. All the drama and intensity of this civil war odyssey aside wherein returning Odysseus too falls in the wasteland, Renee is simply wonderful. Her perkiness reminds me of an early Shirley Maclaine with the refreshing honesty and simplicity without dumbing it up.  Some fine contrasts between the social classes wherein Belles were raised to be Belles and farm girls were raised to be tough. The mindlessness and dehumanizing aspects of war are also clearly made, especially relevant in today's context [one hopes that this film will be shown at the White House...and understood there!]. Fine performances from Kidman and Jude, Hoffman and Sutherland...indeed, all give their best.  The corruption of the local Homeguard is often overlooked and it was a fine point to make.  The outstanding message seems to be that there was not a hell of a lot of romance in killing each other during the Civil War.  Hopefully, this message will be understood as being just as relevant today as it was then.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Worst film since English Patient,"After The English patient, I thought that nothing can be more kitschy and stupid while pretending to be very artistic. I was wrong. This is much, much worse than The English patient... The characters are incredibly stereotypical, the big ""stars"" are so weak you wouldn't believe. So is the story - especially if you compare it to that of the novel. (I'm not writing this because I believe a film adaptation should be faithful to the book, but in this case, like so often, the difference in quality is outrageous.) The music is the usual fake, flashy, gushy Hollywood score (there are very few good score composers in Hollywood...) This film is not even worth writing more about it. Definitely made for the Oscar, but the Academy for the first time seemed to ignore the bribe of Miramax, and fortunately this film didn't win any important award - except for Renee's that was rather a compensation for Bridget Jones...

"No doubt, a very good movie.","Anthony Minghella, who directed `Truly, Madly Deeply' a movie I loved, wrote the screenplay, directed, did other things this jam of a movie. The movie is the life journey of Inman, played by the extremely young looking and talented, Judy Law (`The Talented Mr.Ripley', movie also directed by Minguella; and among others `Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'). Inman's life journey is told in a fashion of a person returning home, in a sense like we all are, in a journey back to the unknown, and to the woman he loves. His life's journey is full of struggles and temptations, but more than anything a very humbly experience. He becomes a deserter and is very much persecuted because of it. Oscar winner Nicole Kidman (The Hours) is absolutely beautiful in the movie, and plays a very pampered pastor's kid. Now comes Renee Zellweger as `Ruby Thewes' (`One True Thing,' `Bridget Jones Diary' and the much anticipated, `Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason.' She is an actress I absolutely adore, with that super fast southern accent, and full of bravery very upfront, making everyone laugh. Just when you think things are pretty bad.  Watching Renee work is worth the ticket price. I have watched at least fifty percent of her work, if not more. She is a very good actress. I can say every line of `One True Thing,' Yes... I can talk like Bridget.'perfect' and know the lines as well.  Renee has a sense of self worth, innocence, a strong sense of morals, even moved to NY, not to be polluted by Hollywood, that makes her a very, very  special  She DESERVES Golden Globes,  and Oscar and whatever other statuettes they are handing out this year. So please, members of whatever vote for RENEE!!!!!!! Please! I liked the other characters especially, the N.Y.U. graduate Phillip Seymour Hoffman `Veasey', who played in `Twister' plus 37 more movies. He is always playing those disturbed people. I look at him now and start laughing. Just like when I look at Jack Nicholson (`Something's Gotta Give,' `As Good as it Gets') I just crack up! I view this movie as the Inman's life journey of, regardless of where he is heading. It is his complete journey. Along with `Glory,' ` The Love Letter' (a movie worth looking for, with Campbell Scott and Jennifer Jason Leigh) are my favorite movies about the Civil War. Speaking about a very American topic, Civil War, our Civil war, explain going to Romania. I find no reason for such fiasco, besides cheaper labor, than if made in the U.S., why sent those people all the way to Romania???????  when there are so many actors that could work in right here in our back yard... and don't feel like going all the way to Hollywood to get started.  For that I find no excuse. Sorry... but the money should have stayed right here with us. We are in wartime, Hello!!!!  This irritates me. But I must say the photography is beautiful, and so is the music. I recommend the movie, but I am not that much into drama. There are enough funny parts. My favorite and most funny lines came from Ruby and Veasey. Ruby: `They call this war a cloud over the land. But they made the weather and then they stand in the rain and say 'Sh** its raining.'

"Both Pointless And Charmless, But It Does Have Renee Zellweger","Essentially, this movie could have chosen to move in one of two ways: either as a war movie, depicting the agony that the Civil War wrought upon the South and its citizens, or as a romance, depicting the agony of lovers separated by war and uncertain whether they'll ever see each other again. In the end, it tries to do both, with the emphasis being on the romance, and, in the end, I found neither part of the story - which seemed to me to jump around far too much, giving it an unfocused feel - either convincing or compelling. The challenges faced by the South are realistically portrayed, particularly with the emphasis on the ""Home Guard"" - a group of Southerners tasked with the job of searching down deserters and those sheltering them, and who, as the war approached its inevitable conclusion, chose to abuse their positions to satisfy their own desires rather than to fulfill their admittedly distasteful job. This part of the story was often brutal - perhaps realistically so - but it left me rather empty to be honest.As to the romance, it struck me as both forced and artificial. Neither Ada (Nicole Kidman) nor Inman (Jude Law) came across to me as star-crossed lovers, although I suppose that the point of the movie was that it was their love for each other that gave them hope, and the strength to get through their trials. Still, neither character really connected with me. The one character I did like was Ruby (Renee Zellweger) although, to be honest, it wasn't so much the character that appealed to me as it was Zellweger playing the character. Zellweger is a fine actress who seems to be able to take on any role in any type of movie and make it work. As to Law and Kidman, neither appealed to me. Law seemed flat, and Kidman, who is a very beautiful woman, nevertheless generally underwhelms me with her performances.For Zellweger's performance alone, 2/10",2.0,Anonymous,History

Nice Acting,"This movie, suffering a just a little from the semi-believability of the plot (a tale set in modern times and loosely based on real events; the real and somewhat less than heroic desertion a centerpiece for rumination), is nonetheless engaging and so well cast, acted and filmed it deserves a viewing.  The fans of ""Dances With Wolves"" will be delighted as well as those enamored of the Odysseyan journey-film, sure always to be populated with oddball characters, punctuated with humorous moments and almost always senseless violence.   ""Dead Man"" seems to be the only film of the recent past with the feel of ""Cold Mountain"", though the earlier film had more bizarre events than are recorded in the latter.  But here we must note the attractiveness of the cast in ""Cold Mountain"".  Renee would look great in a burlap sack, and Jude Law and Nicole are of the same ilk. The battle scenes are all quite good, although it is a bit of a stretch to think Inman would find his documents so readily after so horrendous an explosion.  And for the life of me I cannot determine how the ""turkey shoot"" devolved into a hand-to-hand combat situation within a few frames of film. Inman's journey (oddly from inland to coast to inland) expressly exploits the ""Dead Man"" aspect (or more recently ""Oh Brother.."") view of travels cross country.  Note the completely rural setting of all the scenes; even in the U.S. of the 1860's it would be difficult to steer such a course.  Not on any occasion is a large town sighted. There is more than enough good writing to offer us some laughs, but for certain Ms. Zellwegger steals the show.

"mostly fiction, historically inaccurate","One would think that the setting of this movie was in Kansas with Quantrills Raiders and the Jayhawkers, not North Carolina. This movie is full of brutal atrocities that never happened in North Carolina and to some extent not during the Civil War.For example is the rogue Southern militia rounding up deserters and punishing all they believed helped them. Deserters were not executed by the militia as depicted in this movie. They were turned over to the nearest Souther Army units and then sent back to their units where they were court martialed and executed as example in their own units.Another example was the incursion of a Union patrol into the North Carolina mountains in 1864. That did not happen but members of this patrol attempt to rape a widow with a baby. Never happened. One of the atrocities that didn't occur during the Civil War was rape. The entire scene was unreal. A patrol might scavenge for food but the soldiers would have most respectful to the woman, particularly since she had a baby. They would have been solicitous of her welfare.And then when the widow escapes from the soldiers, she finds a rifle that did not exist in the Civil War and shoots a naked soldier running for his life in the back. Pure nonsense.Then the Southern deserter has the horses of the Union patrol available to ride to his destination but instead of using the horses he continues walking across the mountains. Could he be that stupid? Nicole Kidman was completely miscast in this movie like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. Even her costumes are too well tailored for a mountain girl.And her acting left a lot to be desired. Renee Zelwigger fit her part perfectly which was that of a homely mountain girl.All in all, this movie didn't bother with the facts.

Kidman is the daughter of a preacher  she can play piano and speak several languages but is poorly equipped to look after herself when times get hard. Zellwegger plays her down-to-earth companion and saving grace and as such is a revelation. Jude Law's character as a moral' soldier is an interesting one, as his long journey, physical and emotionally, against many difficulties.This epic tale tells not only of the torments of facing very alien scenarios unprepared, but of a love that spans several years of separation, based on next to nothing, and yet is the guiding light giving hope to the future. Kidman rises to the challenge and delivers another memorable performance. She is backed up by superb ensemble acting and fine storytelling, beautifully adapted to the screen.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"so bad, such a waste","Yikes this movie was a bunch of boring treacle - kinda like cookie cutter formula for pulling on the heartstrings of women...only it didn't work in my case...I was bored stiff by the plot, and as for the winning performance of Rene Zellwegger...I have no idea why she nabbed it for this role?!Ohmigod and how long and overdrawn were the constant battles and fights. It's hilarious to watch the suitor get blown up a gazillion times just to make it back to the 'true love', who is someone he only knew from trays of punch. C'mon, puhleez!

The Best Film of the Year,"This was most definitely  the best film of the year. I thought Anthony Minghella did an amazing job of staying true to the book. Nicole Kidman's accent was kinda weak, but believable. Renee Zellweger was amazing in all aspects. Jude Law had the best accent and did an incredible job. That and he is really, really hot. I don't think the violence is over done at all. I mean it's really not that graphic and there's not that much of it. The sexuality really seems to be a big issue. If you are a mature person than you won't have a problem with it. It's not that bad and it is completely necessary to the story. Anyways go see it. It's worth your time and money. I loved it.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Nice!,"Anthony Minghella (Truly, Madly Deeply, The English Patient) always interests me. The movie is the life journey of Inman returning home to the woman he loves, played by the extremely young looking and talented, Judy Law (The Talented Mr. Ripley, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil). I paralleled his return to `Ada' played by Nicole Kidman (The Hours, The Others ) as most people's life.  Inman's life journey is told in a fashion of a person returning home, in a sense like we all are, in a journey back to the unknown, and to the woman he loves. His life's journey is full of struggles and temptations, but more than anything a very humbly experience. He becomes a deserter and is very much persecuted because of it. Now comes Renee Zellweger as `Ruby Thewes' (`One True Thing,' `Bridget Jones Diary' and the much anticipated, `Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason.' She is an actress I absolutely adore, with that super fast southern accent, and full of bravery very upfront, making everyone laugh. Just when you think things are pretty bad.  Watching Renee work is worth the ticket price.  She DESERVES Golden Globes,  and Oscar and whatever other statuettes they are handing out this year. So please, members of whatever vote for RENEE!!!!!!! Please! I liked the other characters especially, the N.Y.U. graduate Phillip Seymour (Twister ) Hoffman `Veasey'.  He is always playing those disturbed people and entertaining people. I look at him now and start laughing. Just like when I look at Jack Nicholson (`Something's Gotta Give,' `As Good as it Gets') I just crack up! I view this movie as the Inman's life journey of, regardless of where he is heading. It is his complete journey. Along with `Glory,' ` The Love Letter'  with Campbell Scott and Jennifer Jason Leigh, Cold Mountain will stand as of my favorite movies about the Civil War.The scenery is beautiful, the photography outstanding, loved the music. My favorite and most funny lines came from Ruby and Veasey. Favorite Line:  Ruby: `They call this war a cloud over the land. But they made the weather and then they stand in the rain and say 'S--- its raining.'",9.0,Anonymous,History
A Long Journey Home,"I liked this movie a lot and am amazed at the relatively large number of people who gave Cold Mountain a low number. Perhaps these are folks who have read the book and were disappointed in the movie's treatment of the story, but I haven't read the book so can't comment on that. This was a side of the Civil War that was relatively unknown to me--the desperate situation back on the home front, particularly involving self-righteous individuals searching for deserters. I found the movie incredibly moving, the war scenes horrific, and the love story unbelievably touching.Bottom line: Any movie that moves me to tears once earns a high rating in my book. A two-hanky movie moves up a notch, and a three-hanky movie, such as Cold Mountain, is a true winner.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Love is that I will come back to you,"Love and war are the two eternal themes in movies and literary works, and this film is the combination of the two, which makes this love extremely warm and great. In the story of ""Cold Mountain"", love is faith, persistence, willing waiting, and solemn and stirring to face death. The lines, scenes, shots, music and costumes like the poetry of the film make people sink into it and cannot extricate themselves from it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
An excellent drama that captures the dangers of the day,"Civil War films are of particular personal interest because of my many forbears who fought and died defending their homes.  The film opens with a dramatic re-enactment of the horrific Battle of the Crater. The necessary meanness that comes with combat is seen on both sides as well as acts of personal heroism. The Crater foreshadows the bloody battles of WWI and re-enactors will be engrossed. It is, however, a film about a Southerner's dangerous road home whether it was before or after the Surrender.Jude Law's performance is extraordinary.  Up until the 1950s when roads came to NC's mountains, people spoke a dialect closely resembling 18th century English; so his articulation is effective as this would have resembled the language spoken in England at that time.  He also captures the sense of the strong, quiet mountain man who is a formidable adversary but inept in the language of love. Zellweger's performance also celebrates the virtues and determination of a woman from the Smokies.  Her dialect, expression, and sentiments capture the heart of the clever and quick witted Carolinian of the day. There has been no better performance by a supporting actress. While most of the characters rely on 'types', those that are developed are well done.  The licentiousness of some characters seems a bit over the top. For example, the murderous minister's character (not the father) is the exception rather than the rule. Read Glasgow's ""Barren Ground"" for an accurate, fictional depiction of white landowners relationships with African Americans.The film's use of folk music is effective and helps develop the audience's understanding of Cole Mountain.  Was  surprised that the director did not use ""Imogene"" or ""In the Pines"" for the song played in the hospital.The announcement of war in the film is poorly done and unfair to Western North Carolinians.  If they celebrated they would have sung ""Dixie"" (a song I heard played at the end of every major evening event followed by hurrahs until about 1970, which is an appropriate time for that custom to die). The idiotic, visceral hollaring about war is just that. Many opposed the war. One forebear from a tobacco growing region argued in county debates in 1861 to remain with the Union. When defeated in debate he enlisted as a private to defend his homeland. In 1864, North Carolina's gubernatorial debate centered on whether or not to re-enter The Union. The secessionists narrowly won the election. And she was the state who lost more men in the conflict than any other Southern state. But many other parts ring true. Great-great uncle Vann died at the age of 12 as a bugle boy. All we have is a tin type of him in his uniform. Great-great Uncle Bill was murdered by a scalawag while trying to return home.  It was a time of great nobility of spirit and base profiteering.  Very few people today in either the North or South understand the ethos of the players in the War Between the States and this film brings us a bit closer, if by way of metaphor rather than history. The best still remains ""Birth of a Nation"".There is much more to be said for than against this film.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"Anthony Minghella's art is the key with Renee Zellweger the ""winner"" of an all star cast","It is hard for me to say much bad about Anthony Minghella's work.  I think The English Patient was among the best movies ever made.  Cold Mountain is not that good but it is very good in its own right.Nicole Kidman is really growing as an actor and her work grows proportionally.  But the real gem in this film is Renee Zellweger. She is a lock for a lot of awards for this role.The film is beautiful and sweeping in scope and short a few nit-picking things about a lot of sing song sessions going on when danger lurked around every corner from the ""home guard""...but as I say,... that is splitting hairs.  This is a wonderful movie.  Go see it!",8.0,Anonymous,History
A good movie - not a great movie,"I find it a little ironic that Cold Mountain took an English Director (Anthony Minghella), a British Actor (Jude Law), an Australian Actress (Nicole Kidman) and a supporting cast that primarily showcased a Canadian (Donald Sutherland) and an Irishman (Brendan Gleeson), to bring to the screen the best movie set during the American Civil War since 1989's Glory. Don't get me wrong, Renee Zellweger and Phillip Seymour Hoffman have probably the two most memorable roles within the movie's 155-minute frame, but it's the southerly-accent-challenged that get the most screen time.Cold Mountain is directed by Minghella (who has worked with Law and Hoffman before in The Talented Mr. Ripley), who worked from a script he adapted from the best selling novel by Charles Frazier.  The story surrounds a young woman named Ada Monrow (Kidman) who falls in love with the town handyman Inman (Law) right before the breakout of the American Civil War.  After a horrific battle with the Americans, Inman is injured and decides to dessert the army to travel back to his true love.  Back at the ranch (literally), Ada is finding the times hard.  Her father has died and Ada is unable to maintain the farm and garden.  Enter one Ruby Thewes (Zellweger) who hears of Ada's plight and attempts to show her how to cultivate the land and groom the animals in exchange for free room and board and the eating at the same table as the owner.Time goes on and the movie weaves between the lives of the two central characters.  Inman continues his odyssey back to Cold Mountain, evading those that hunt deserters and running into an eclectic bunch of characters that include a sexual promiscuous priest (Hoffman), a woman and a child left lonely by the war (Natalie Portman) and a hillbilly type character (Giovanni Ribisi) that lures Inman into his self-indulgent web.In contrast, Ada and Ruby continue to work the land and Ada soon becomes capable of sustaining the property on her own. We watch as they build fences together, grow crops and hunt for food.  They become friends and no sooner does Ruby confide in Ada of her abusive father, Stobrod (Gleeson) than he shows up caught in food trap on their property. Stobrod and his daughter begin to rekindle their loving relationship of oldBut where would a movie be without a villain, and Cold Mountain has a few in a posse of men that are out to get back land once theirs and to rid themselves of undesirable deserters within their midst.  When the posse crosses paths with Stobrod and his band, Stobrod is killed and when Inman finally returns to the warm embrace of Ada, a gunfight ensues with nary a man standing its conclusion.Cold Mountain is one of those films that does everything an Oscar contender should.  It takes a bunch of good-looking, previously nominated stars puts them in a big budget war/drama/romance film with a love story that is multi-generational.  Minghella does his best with a multi-layered novel and brings to the screen characters that are both believable and enjoyable. But it is the relationship between Ada and Inman, or the lack of it, which is at the core of Cold Mountain's problems.  These two characters share but a kiss and rarely have any scenes together, so it is not very credible that they would pine for each other as they do throughout the film.   This suspension of belief alienates the audience from connecting with the two leads.  Everyone involved with the film is well cast (even and including Jena Malone as the Ferry Girl), but it is Renee Zellweger (who was a colored woman in the novel) stands head above the rest in her portrayal as the rough around the edges Rudy.I heard one critic say that `Cold Mountain is a good film, not a great film', and I can't think of a better way to describe it.  The battle sequences you will admire in the trailer play a small part in the overall production so be prepared more for a dramatic romance rather than the fight for ones true love.  That said, Cold Mountain should do quite well come Oscar nomination time.  Kidman and Zellweger are Academy favorites and Minghella has won before with The English Patient.   In a year where the best films have all been about dark and dreary subject matters (21 Grams, Mystic River), Cold Mountain may stand above them all in late February with a bunch of non-anatomically correct statues in its hand.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Beautiful!,"In my mind the best movie of 2003. Yes, ""Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" was a wonderful movie, ""Cold Mountain"" was everything I want to see in a movie. It had a beautiful romance that came at the very beginning of the Civil War. The most romantic part of the movie is that they fight to hang onto, some hope that the other is not dead or wed another.""Cold Mountain"" shows what war will do to people. There are scenes in the movie that will make you laugh, cry and even realize that even in the darkest of ages, even in the most desolate of times there is some hope that people can hold onto.For those people who have read the book it maintains the true essence of Charles Frazier's masterpiece. It shows the beauty of the South and the terrifying events that changed America forever.Inman's struggle is a version of the ""Odyssey"". Inman's eternal struggle will make you reach for your tissues. When he tells yells ""I'm done, I am done fighting."" It makes you fall in love with him ten times over. He has struggled to leave the war, but it seems that the war is only at his doorstep.Thank you Anthony Minghella for making movies such as this. Thank you for maintaining the classical way of film making.Cold Mountain gets a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Not a Civil War film,"If someone hadn't told you, you wouldn't know that this was civil war film. We've all come to expect that there would be some battle scenes in a Civil War film yet there was one scene at the start of the film and it was very short.It was basically a war about Southerners who were excited about getting into a war but after a few years decided to desert. Deserters are shot and those deserters are pursued throughout the film for their betrayal of the ideals for which they started this war.Yes, there was some good acting but the film dragged on and had very little action.It wasn't until after I read the reviews about the film that I found out it was made by the same dork that gave us one of the most boring films in history, ""The English Patient"". If I had known about this before renting this film, there's no way I would have rented this clap-trap.If you're in the mood for a mindless, boring, ineffectual film, then this is the film for you.For the love of everything that's holy, don't watch this nonsense.",1.0,Anonymous,History
did Minghella even read the book?,"First off - let me state that I enjoyed this film very much. Now...let me begin my rant.  I understand that every book or novel that is turned into a movie is subject to screenplay interpretations and revisions;  a custom tailoring, if you will.  But in the beginning, at the very touchstone of any screenplay of a successful novel, there must be the essence of the author's intention by which to proceed forward from.  In the case of ""Cold Mountain"" it is just that - Cold Mountain.  The book's central theme - it's essence - was Inman's love of home and longing for it's simpler life (back in Cold Mountain, NC) and THEN his love for Ada.  I'm not downplaying that a major major theme of the book was the lovestory of Inman for Ada and vice-verca - and of course, the movie played that to the hilt.  However, to ignore or at the very most make scant reference to, Inman's love of home and life back in Cold Mountain does the book and the moviegoer a great injustice.Another theme (a central one at that) was Inman's abhorrence to the war and his own disgust with himself for his loss of innocence through his horrific experiences.  I understand the time restrictions and limitations of film, but to barely develop the author's true characterization of Inman will leave those who did not read the book prior to seeing the film at a loss of why Inman was such a righteous man BEFORE the war.It's interesting to think what Minghella would have done if given Homer's The Odyssey instead of Cold Mountain to direct.  Would he choose to ignore the near god-like status that Homer betroths upon Odysseus throughout his epic and rush to  put him in the sack with Kidman's fair-headed Penelope? Would he skip the Sirens and the Lotus Eaters in favor of a more violent encounter with the Swineherd?Probably.",9.0,Anonymous,History
The best movie I have seen this year!!!,"I read the book Cold Mountain, and it is a wonderful book well written, haunting and emotionally involving.  I usually am deeply disappointed when I see a movie based on a book I've read.  Not this time!!!  This is a 2.5 hour plus movie, and not once did I look at my watch.  Anthony Minghella beautifully captured the feeling of the book, which is a somewhat surrealistic journey for Inman through all of the faces of evil temptation and a test of his inner strength and determination.  It also captures the trials of Ada as she struggles to learn to become useful in spite of her sheltered upbringing, and to hold onto her belief that Inman will return, and to overcome the dark designs of the local ""home guard"" soldiers.See this movie, it is haunting, uplifting and moving.  Also, read the book, because Charles Frazier is a masterful writer, and no movie could quite capture the beautiful quality of his use of the language.",9.0,Anonymous,History

The love epic of the year,"Having read a great deal about the film during its production, I have to admit that Cold Mountain was my most anticipated movie of the year. Now, having finally seen it, I'm pleased to say that not only did it live up to my expectations; it has exceeded them in many occasions.Through its portrayal of the brutality of war, Cold Mountain more importantly conveys a powerful love story that transcends distance.Aside from the breathtaking cinematography that takes us into the world of Cold Mountain, director Anthony Minghella yet again managed to assemble such a group of talents as his leading characters. Because so many have already commented on the scene-stealing performance given by Renee Zellweger, let us focus on the other two, more subdued, performances given by Jude Law and Nicole Kidman. We should observe things from a different perspective. Unlike Ruby, Inman and Ada are much more introverted. They do not easily reveal their emotions through gesture or speech; instead, they most often communicate silently through their eyes that convey the sense of hope, of despair, and most importantly of love.In addition, worth mentioning is that even though the two lovers, separated by war, are not to be seen in the same scene for the majority of the film, Minghella, through his juxtaposition of certain scenes, hints a sense of an emotional interaction between Inman and Ada. These poignant yet subtle details are what convince the audience of the reality and the passions of the love between these two characters.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Irony and the Fabricated Ending,"I know that happy endings don't necessarily make good literature, that irony is the hallmark of excellence, and that happy endings can be trite and fabricated.

Since all endings are fabricated, why couldn't the author have fabricated differently?",9.0,Anonymous,History
cold mtn,"High on the list of asses I would enjoy kicking (somewhere between Trevor Bauer's and my tenth grade algebra teacher's) is that of the person who told Anthony Minghella, most likely in his theatrical directing youth when he was staging S Beckett, that slow equals serious, thoughtful, and artistic rather than what it almost always is, in movies at least, namely dull, boring and pretentious.The end product of Minghella's listening to such advice is this nearly three hour soporific about the American Civil War, a conflict which, as I learned for the first time, was populated, in western North Carolina at least, principally by Aussies, Brits, Canadians...and Renee Zellweger,* whose Walter Brennan-ish efforts at comic relief serve merely to put the tedium in starker contrast.Rarely has Nicole Kidman been as bland as she is playing straight man to Zellweger. Hell, even Ray Winstone is forgettable. And Minghella manages to pull off a feat I would have thought impossible, i.e. Making Philip Seymour Hoffman ordinary! However, Jude Law is in his proper hole in the screen element. Give it a C for cold, as in how it leaves the viewer.Great cinematography, though.*Ironically Ms. Z, who broke the Meryl Streep glass ceiling in ""Bridget Jones"", here abets it by being, along with Hoffman, the token Yank in the cast.",5.0,Anonymous,History
wow! - powerful and involving,"Wow, what a movie! After ""Chicago"" last year, Miramax has done it again. Come Oscar time, look for Cold Mountain to get plenty of nominations - and hopefully a gold statue for Rene Zellwegger.Roger Ebert has criticized Jude Law's and Nicole Kidman's characters as being like islands, complete unto themselves. I agree; while the two are talking, you just about want to grab them and say, ""oh come on you two, start smooching already!""But if they're islands, what islands they are. ""Inman"" is, on one hand, a man so gentle he can catch birds with his bare hands, but also a cunning warrior who will kill when he has to. ""Ada"" is an upperclass lady who falls on horrible times, and does what she must to survive. Yet nevertheless she remains a lady, with skin that never loses its  soft pearlescent glow.Rene Zellwegger - wow, can you imagine anyone more perfect for this part! I loved ""Ruby's"" outspoken words and manner. Yet Ruby and Ada hit it off like sisters. Their chemistry is delightful, and you sense they're having fun. Rene's chemistry with musician Jack White is also tangible, and a closing scene involving children may be prophetic.There is some VERY beautiful photography in this. There is also a lot of blood. As with ""Master and Commander,"" the fighting is often point-blank and frightfully realistic. Several good people die. (Several bad people die too, happily, but still....ewwww!) Funny how you can see three James Bond films in a row and never blink an eye, and then you see this and just about reach for a glass of water.My only other complaint with Cold Mountain has to do with a love scene between the lead characters. I find it too graphic, and out of harmony with the rest of the film. Inman's and Ada's love is built on faith, promises and high ideals. Likewise then, their love making should have been romantic, idealized and cloaked with mystery.Frankly, it seemed like the director or somebody wanted a sex scene, so okay, they did a sex scene. Ugh. In contrast, the sex that happens earlier in the movie suits the primal nature of those characters and that situation. It seems funny to say this, but in this context, I did not want to see close-ups of Nicole Kidman's tush.Whatever. Nine out of ten is still an awfully good film. Enjoy it!",9.0,Anonymous,History
travel from the war,"I should start by noting that I've never read the novel on which Anthony Minghella's ""Cold Mountain"" is based. Seeing the movie on its own, I can say that it's a good movie. The gist of it is that war damages all sides involved. Inman (Jude Law) and Ada (Nicole Kidman) have vastly dissimilar experiences in the US Civil War but they both get affected by it. Even after the war, the effects will take years or even decades to heal.The most interesting character in the movie is Ruby (Renée Zellweger). From a background unlike Ada's, she always has something to say. But she, like the other characters, won't remain untouched by the events surrounding her.One of the points made with the movie is that not every southerner at the time was a slave-owning racist. Plenty of them rejected the plantation system and simply wanted to live their lives. It was unfortunate that the events of the ten years following the Civil War resulted in the old Confederates rising to power again and establishing the Jim Crow Laws, resulting in almost a century of institutionalized racism.Anyway, it's worth seeing. Zellweger deserved her Oscar for her role.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent movie,"I enjoyed this movie.  In reading some of the external reviews for this movie there seems to be universal praise for Renee Zellweger's performance and I would agree.  There also seems to be some disappointment in the fact that the two main stars are separated throughout the movie and in this I disagree.  Whereas the detractors seem upset that the movie was supposed to be a great love story, I never took it for that.  It was true that the two main protangonists are infatuated with each other in the beginning, how can that be mistaken for love.  However, each becomes the symbol to the other of the way they want the world to be and not the daily horror the war has made it.  It is clear from the beginning that Inman's home coming is going to be long delayed, and that the story is each protagonists' reaction to the war and how they managed to survived it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
'Mountain' Stands Tall,"Despite the reviews of this movie and its lack of major Oscar recognition, I thought it was one of the best movies of 2003. It is not only beautiful to look at, but it is both sad and hopeful at the same time. Every scene is equally as important as the last and in the end it feels like you have actually seen the lives of these people, felt their pain and understood them through it all.The great novel that this was adapted from is just the beginning of many amazing elements that came together to make Cold Mountain a success. The screenplay does not feel like too much has been crammed into in but loosely enjoys the story that it is telling. The dialogue feels right and even though all the actors could have improved on their accents, this flaw seems to fade into the background because the actors don't place the emphasis on their words to tell the story but rather use them as one of their many tools instead of the only one as is the mistake in so many movies.And as for those actors who couldn't create the accents...well, they can create characters. Nicole lives up to her title as Academy Award winner and gives a better performance than the one that got her that title. Jude Law's character is the simplest and he knows it. You won't see him stealing any scenes from his co-stars but that is what is supposed to be. Renee is the polar opposite of that. She is the comic relief for the film and she does it with grace. Her loud and very southern character of Ruby fits her well, but then again, so does everything else she does. She just further shows us that she is one of very few actors working today with a range that has yet to be defined. She is the focus of our attention whether we want her to be or not.The entire film feels very natural and is one of the years best. ****/****",8.0,Anonymous,History
Aptly named Cold Mountain is completely devoid of heat.,"Webster's defines ""cold'"" as ""marked by lack of warm feeling."" That perfectly describes this film.

Romanian Mountains look like the Smokies.,"Having been born and raised within a few miles of the N.C.mountains I could believe that I was back there, until I spotted one of the crows on a fence as a gray and black Hooded crow, sub-species of the Eurasian Carrion Crow, which are not found in North America.

Absolutely perfect,"Before going to see Cold Mountain I have heard several comments about it. Most of them said it is cold, for me is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. And it is not cold, but warm and emotive. I enjoyed and loved the whole movie, from beginning to end, though there are some moments that, for me, are specially great: the first kiss between Inman and Ada (I didn´t expected it and breaks the ""coldness"" between the couple), the scene with the white pigeon in the church (shows Inman's sensibility), when Ruby appears (Renée Zellweger really surprised me, she is completely different from her other movies and makes a great performance), when Ada and Inman meet again, and of course the end, which I wish it was different but the truth is that it is absolutely perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"Historically Asinine, Tremendously Depressing Entertainment!","When the historical context of a film that is based in a setting as well documented and relevant as the American Civil War is so completely falsified as is contrived in this film there is only one thing to do: turn off the brain and try to enjoy the movie on its entertainment merits alone. Unfortunately, this film is so depressing there is no entertainment value. In a word, Blech!Even illiterates involved in the Civil War had clearly understood at least the basic reasons they were fighting.  Both sides had concrete and heart-felt convictions to the last man.  There is no excuse for painting it as a Vietnam style political fiasco-- even allowing that over simplistic view of Vietnam-- other than outright ignorance or a desire to revise public perception of what really happened.  Read a book, people!Hollywood's obsession with antichristian themes is annoyingly prevailant these days, but here we have a blatant case of malicious slander against anything related to church, even though the moral influences of christians in general played an enormous role in America's growth and stability, and particularly in Abe Lincoln's resolve to follow moral issues rather than political ones in fighting the Civil War, to the ongoing benefit of African-Americans and the United States overall.  Contrary to Hollywood idiocy, men of the cloth are not and have not been the scum of the earth as a matter of habit(present Catholic controversies notwithstanding).",1.0,Anonymous,History
A Gritty Look Back,"If there was anything that really stuck out to me in Cold Mountain, it was the beautiful imagery.  The scenery was just amazing, and you really get a sense that you are looking at a Civil War-era South.  Some may complain that this movie lacked compassion or chemistry, but wasn't life back then a lot more restricted than it is now?I thought the actors did a tremendous job, but it was the side characters that really stole the show.  Natalie Portman gave a very strong performance in a small, but powerful scene.  Philip Seymour Hoffman provided some surprising comic relief as did Renee Zellwegger who really shined as a tomboy who resurrects Nicole Kidman's broken down ranch.  In fact, I'd say Renee deserves an Oscar for this role, but that's not for me to decide.The movie is a little long, but you come to appreciate the struggle Jude Law's character goes through as he treks miles to reunite with Nicole Kidman, all while being hunted down as a traitor.  I imagine this story isn't that far from the truth.  Life was quite different back then, as I noted earlier, and probably more ruthless, so it wouldn't surprise me that some people were hunted down like dogs.So overall, this is a very powerful flick.  It gives you a true sense of what life was like back then, and it's another adaption of the classic Odyssey tale that just never gets old.My IMDb Score: 10/10.  My Yahoo!

Cold Mountain - A Review,"Ada and Inman love each other. But like most young people, they take life and time for granted and leave things unsaid. Only when Inman is called to fight for the South in the American Civil War do they realize the magnitude of their loss. Separated and constantly assailed by the horrors of war, death of loved ones and the cruelty of weak men, they hold on to the hope of finding each other to keep them alive.Director Anthony Minghella creates truly memorable images that are certain to linger on in the viewer's memory. The scenes where Ada and Inman interact are carefully played down and manage to maintain a clear originality. The superb visual style of the film owes much to the excellent work of cinematographer John Seale, who worked with Minghella in 'The English Patient' and in 'The Talented Mr. Ripley'.Jude Law does a good job of portraying Inman, a man of few words, and the scriptwriters made sure his lines are well worth the utter. Equally impressive is Nicole Kidman, whose character (Ada) undergoes a complete transformation from a shy, spoiled girl to a brave and resilient woman. But Renee Zellweger is the one who steals the show as the laborer Ruby - in fact, she's so good you almost forget her character is rather two-dimensional.All in all, Cold Mountain is a very satisfying cinematic experience that works on all levels - good acting, well-structured screenplay, assured direction, beautiful soundtrack and superb cinematography. And unlike most long films, it keeps a fast pace right to the very end. A realistic, sometimes brutal, love story, Cold Mountain is a true work of art.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"well-done, interesting tale","A Civil War saga and romance, Cold Mountain portrays a beautiful, patient love in contrast to impulsive brutality and random killing.  Although the violence seems overdone and overemphasized at times, it serves to highlight the terror that enveloped soldier and civilian alike, hardening hearts. Overall, a fabulous story with remarkable direction by Anthony Minghella and powerful acting.  The uncommon fidelity of the lovers makes this movie unique among love stories, although the superficiality of the relationship made it a bit less than it could have been.  I would also have liked to see more on the life and recovery of their neighbor who lost her husband and sons to brutal attacks of deserter patrols.  A few script shortcomings, but interesting characters, excellent camerawork, setting and production quality.  8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History

A tale of two movies,"When Miramax spends $80 million dollars of their money to back a film, then spends another $25 million for marketing it, you can be sure that they expect huge things in return for their investment.  Then again what studio doesn't?   Most studios are pleased as punch when their films simply give them a profitable return on their investment.  I'm sure Miramax loves a profit margin as well as any other studio but for films like Cold Mountain they make them because of the little visions of gold Oscar statuettes dancing around like so many sugar plums in Harvey Weinstein's head.  Nothing wrong with that either, I suppose, but when you set out to make a film with winning awards being a top priority, everybody had better be at the top of their game.  It is apparent in Cold Mountain that everyone involved is trying hard to achieve greatness.Minghella bring us the riveting stories of a Confederate Soldier, Inman Balis, struggling to find his way back home to the life and the woman he loves, Ada Monroe.  Ada, at the same time is struggling to hold on to her farm with the help of Mountain woman Ruby Thewes.Cold Mountain is a breathtaking film to look at.  John Seale's cinematography of Civil War Battles and landscape is almost worth the price of admission alone.  Dante Ferrati's production design, especially in an early battle sequence will leave you gasping. Along with Minghella's direction, it will remind one of the opening sequence of Saving Private Ryan.  In other words, war is chaos and hell, and there's not much glory in getting your body parts blown around the battle field.I can find no fault with the acting in this film either.  Though some have been critical of Nicole Kidman performance and most notably her accent. I found her southern accent to be every bit on a par with many others who have played the Southern Belle but were hardly from the South.  It is (the accent) easily comparable to that of Vivien Leigh's Scarlett in Gone With The Wind.  As for her performance, it is a role that is not demonstrative, requires reserve and Kidman gives it exactly that.  So why fault an actress for staying in character and bringing to life the role of Ada Monroe as it was meant to be?Jude Law will quickly make you forget his robotic role in AI. As Inman Balis, he too is a quiet reserved Confederate soldier, who is willing to fight for the cause up until he has nothing left to give, and begins to see how hopeless and pointless the bloodletting has become.As mountain woman, Ruby Thewes, Renee Zellweger nearly steals the show. When she shows up to aid Ada in putting her farm back together, she brings new life to the film and the audience.  Having watched as Ada struggles just to stay alive, and as Inman deserts the Confederate Army, Ruby gives us a shining glimmer of much needed hope.  She is a strong willed, no nonsense woman, and with Ada and Ada's farm sees a chance to have something that would not have been possible previously.There is not enough words available to me to talk about the excellence of the rest of the supporting cast.  Brenden Gleeson plays Ruby's no good father who returns for a last chance at redemption.  Eileen Atkins as the always concerned, always giving friend Maddy, who after witnessing one of many senseless acts of brutality in this film, is forever changed.  Natalie Portman as the young widow Sara, trying to deal with the loss of her husband while raising her ill child will make you forget completely about her stale performance in Attack of the Clones.  Ray Winstone, who plays the head of the local home guard, is as evil and lecherous a villain to ever disgrace the South.  Donald Sutherland is also on hand giving a touching portrayal as Ada's father.So, with all the great cast and production values, why does Cold Mountain fail to achieve greatness?  Unfortunately, it just tries to do way too much. Most of the blame is with the screenplay, and the rest of it has to be placed on the shoulders of director Minghella.  In trying to bring us so much story, we are never quite drawn into it the way we should be.  At times we are with Inman as he fights to make his way home, then we are returned to the story of Ada and Ruby on the home front. What this does is shortchange both stories.  The opening scenes between Kidman and Law pass by so quickly that we never truly understand the chemistry between them.  This is made even more difficult because Ada and Inman are both quiet and reserved by nature.  We can see where they may be attracted to one another but we never feel it in our hearts.  Ada's struggles on the farm and Inman's struggle to return home are both captivating in themselves but trying to tell both stories just doesn't blend together. Just as we are being drawn deeply into Inman's story, Minghella quickly whisks us away to check in on Ada and Ruby. By the time we may return to Inman's narrative, it has lost whatever momentum it might have gained.  I would have like to have seen a film about the story of Ada Monroe, Ruby Thewes, Maddy and Teague.  A film about a Confederate soldier deserting the army to return home would also have been a great film.  Putting these two stories together is trying to give us too much of a good thing, and sometimes it's better to have just enough than overfilling the cup.My Grade A-",8.0,Anonymous,History

Fails structure wise.,"The decision to tell this story in flashbacks for much of its beginning does not work to it's advantage as a film. Since I have not read the book, I am not sure how the author structured it to begin with. But flashbacks are always tricky to work with, it has to be done in the right way. Patricularly in films you have to set up the story and characters before you begin throwing flashbacks at the audience.That's my major complaint about ""Cold Mountian"". We get thrown into a love story without first knowing the people it involves, so why should we care? There are some good scenes scattered here and there, and it's a beautiful film to watch; wonderful landscapes, detailed, pretty clothes and attractive people. And the war is portrayed in a respectful manner I guess. Yet, I cannot feel anything for the main characters. It's not that I'm not moved by some scenes, but it's never about their love, it's more about the circumstances of war, and the more interesting character of Ruby.It moves way to quickly, especially in the beginning, for the mood and the care to set in. It feels like a whole 30 minutes or more is missing from the setup. I'm sure the story works better in the book, but it does not hold together as a film. It gets boring as soon as it stops portraying war and goes for the main love story. Might have been better as a mini series.In short: A love story seldom works if you don't care about the lovers. And ""Cold Mountian"" does not give their lovers a chance.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Cold Mountain is not to be given the cold shoulder,"'Cold Mountain' is a fantastic movie about a journey home to a loved one.

Not the year's best but a darn goon one!,"At the end of the Civil War, Confederate soldier W.P. Inman (Jude Law) makes the long, arduous journey back to Cold Mountain, North Carolina to reunite with his sweetheart, Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), whom he left four years ago with only the promise of a relationship-to-be.This epic romance was adapted from the popular bestseller by Charles Frazier, and I'd have to say they did a pretty good job converting the book to film. This movie was met with a lot of disapproving critical reactions but to be honest, I really enjoyed it. I like all of Anthony Minghella's films. And I'll tell you what, it's a lot easier to understand waiting four years for someone you have barely spoken to when that someone is played by Jude Law (or Nicole Kidman, depending on which way you want to look at it - either way, they're both impossibly beautiful).The movie does have some flaws. One - it's hard for our now more...promiscuous human race to understand waiting and waiting and waiting...and waiting and waiting to be with someone you just kissed four years ago. But times were different! At least that's what I told myself. However, this was smoothed over by a hell of a kiss between Law and Kidman before he takes off. I don't know what the critics were thinking when they said there was no chemistry between them, because I'm a-tellin' you these two were on FIRE. I almost felt guilty watching them.Two - and I will be met with some disapproval here, but I absolutely did not like Renee Zellweger as Ruby Thewes, the pistol-packin' mama who comes in to help Ada survive the war. Ruby is a cool character in the book, but I didn't approve of Zellweger's over-the-top, cartoonish, stereotypical Southerner. I will never in a million years understand her receiving an Oscar for this role - it had to be a pity vote. She's kind of funny, but ultimately obnoxious, especially if you read the book - she wasn't at all what I pictured.However, what you do have are divine leads. Jude Law was absolutely wonderful as Inman, exactly as I pictured it in the book. He definitely went through a great transformation along with his character - you'll see him sweat and strain through gunshots, near-deaths, starvation and heartsickness. It's a wonderful moment when he finally gets back to Cold Mountain and reunites with Ada, who I also thought was played beautifully by Nicole Kidman. Were I the one casting, I think I would have gone for someone a little younger for the role, but Nicole has the depth to carry this woman through four years of struggling and starvation. I'm not sure why people attacked Nicole's performance so much, I thought it was subtle and elegant. And as much as I didn't like the Renee casting, she and Nicole were good together. I felt the sisterly love.Also some fine cameos in the supporting cast - a brilliant performance by Natalie Portman is the near-highlight of the movie, rivaled by Kathy Baker as Ada's kindly neighbor Sally.And at the risk of sounding totally and completely shallow - oh what the hell, you'll all agree with me anyway - y'all should watch this movie if for NO other reason but the amazing, amazing scene between Law & Kidman at the end. Oh man... ...I wonder if Jude Law realizes that he will, in fact, be marrying me? He can be MY ain true love!

The final shooting scene is somewhat redundant (kinda remind me of old stupid Westerns); it's like a reminder of the lingering of the civil war but it simply falls into the wrong place.

"A fantastic, refreshingly original and understandably highly acclaimed film from the Writer and Director Anthony Minghella. The film combines some epic footage with superb acting from Jude Law, Nicole Kidman","Cold MountainA fantastic, refreshingly original and understandably highly acclaimed film from the Writer and Director Anthony Minghella. The film combines some epic footage with superb acting from Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and in particular, Renee Zellweger.In his moving and dramatic film, Minghella adapts the book to the big screen with the sort of class and impeccable attention to detail that sets apart quality Writers and Directors from the rest. This is without a doubt the best film adapted from previous material and would be top in this Oscar category, sweeping aside films such as The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, if it was not for the disgraceful shambles surrounding the fact that it was not nominated in the first place. Perhaps this polemic shows that the good people at the Academy didn't want Cold Mountain to go away with too many awards, having already been nominated for six, including Best Achievement in cinematography.As well as the amazing writing and direction of the film, Minghella has managed to use cameo appearances that were as surprising as the quality of the motion picture itself. The cast included actors such as Philip Seymour Hoffman, Giovanni Ribisi, Natalie Portman, Ray Winstone and Charlie Hunnam and many more. This large and tremendously talented cast of well chosen actors helped to give the film just what it needed, a strong sense of community and friendship. This in turn was a brilliantly thought out move to back up the strong bond shared by Inman (Jude Law) and Ada (Nicole Kidman), which is the crux of the film.The action sequences, although incredibly well filmed, were few and far between. Many war films have two plots, the main part of which being the battles, interspersed with short moments from the sub-plot (usually a love story). However, in this plot, such a structure is turned on its head with the main focus being Inman and Ada's struggle to find each other again in the face of considerable danger or hardship. All credit to the writer of the book, Charles Frazier, for creating such an inspiring, touching and originally masterpiece, and to the actors, producers, writers and director for doing it such immeasurable credit.Inman, the wood labourer turned Confederate soldier, struggles to deal with the pressures of the war, and after having been shot, an injury as well. He receives just three of Ada's numerous letters to him and when he hears, in the last letter, that she wishes him to return he sees his opportunity. Temporarily crippled by his injury, Inman must wait to recover before trying to come back to her.' One evening he escapes from the Military Hospital in which he is being treated and heads for his home town of Cold Mountain. Soldier turned deserter,' he is hunted down by the decadent Home Guard.' On his travels he meets an immoral Priest, banished from his home town, and together they are drawn into a web of deceit that leads them to being captured by the Guard, previously their Allies. Inman continues he fight, not only to get back to Ada, but also to survive with serious food and sleep deprivation. This fight is brilliantly acted in its entirety by Jude Law in this winning performance and supported by the cast of just as fine actors.Meanwhile, Ada, sick with love for the man who she is desperate to see and hardly even knows at the same time as facing starvation. She writes that the war is being lost twice over by the people who have been left behind.' In one of her finest performances to date, Nicole Kidman shows that she really knows what acting is all about, emotion. Hungry and poor, Nicole Kidman receives just the help she needs, only from an unexpected source. Ruby (Renee Zellweger), appears on the scene in an excellent performance, capped by her very authentic and well developed Southern accent, to help out. As good as a man in practical skill, Ruby has learnt to look after herself from a young age. She too has her own problems to deal with. In particular, the appearance of her deserter father/ musician and his friends, triggers memories of her hard childhood, caused in part by the neglect of her father. The struggle that she faces is beautifully acted and the grit and the determination that make her what she is are the building blocks for the portray of her character in the film. Renee Zellweger does this with a style and uniqueness that makes the part her own.From set design, to plot, to fantastic casting, this film has all the right ingredients for an all round spectacular film. With one of the best film endings I have ever seen I can justify summing up with the words: Ingenious, resourceful, imaginative and Breath taking!",9.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent,"This movie was leading the Oscar race before it even came out--with it's budget and pedigree, it was touted as the next big epic.  No pressure...It succeeded.  It's a great movie, gritty, powerful, engaging, and wonderfully directed and acted.  It's not quite amazing, but it's worthy of the attention it has received (namely by the Golden Globes).As much as I love Nicole Kidman and how well she did, Renee Zellweger is the best part of the movie.  Her often humorous, yet diverse, roll was perfectly done on her part.  Jude Law was great in the roll that where all the ""gritty"" parts take place, as he is a soldier in the Civil War who escapes to travel home (treason).  Nicole Kidman tries to have a southern accent, and it slips every now and then.  I'm not sure if she was supposed to have a big one, as I think her character doesn't originally come from the south...at any rate, she's great, as usual.  While it's not as ""rangey"" of a character as past performances (namely Moulin Rouge), she takes her role and owns it, sans a perfect accent.I didn't care for all the historical, not harsh, gore, but that's just me. The two and half hours don't fly by, but I was never pondering when the movie was finally going to end.  It was very well done, just short of incredible.  9/10",9.0,Anonymous,History
Historical & Romantic,"It is based on a romance after the Civil War. It is a terrific story, but it took me half an hour to really get into it.  The first part was a bit boring but once I caught on (too many flashbacks), it became very exciting and heartbreaking.  Compared to Gone With the Wind, I'd say Cold Mountain is much better.  Now I know what all the hoorays are about; Nicole Kidman was terrific as well as her leading man Jude Law, and what a strange love affair they did have.  But the one who stole the show was Renee Zellweger.  In fact it took me half an hour to realize who the actress was; playing a distinctly different role, that of a strong self-willed southern gal, she stole the show as well as my heart.  If anyone gets an award, Renee Zellweger should definitely be that one to get it.  The war scenes are brutal and bloodthirsty, but they do not take long, thankfully, and the rest of the two and a half hour show is definitely a must see.  The musical score is mostly piano which I do like, and there are a couple of hillbilly character songs in it.  It's also at least a one hanky film if you are a sentimentalist. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,History
Plodding,"Why are Anthony Minghella's films so plodding? I remember seeing THE English PATIENT at cinemas back in the day and being astonished at how long it felt. Okay, TRULY MADLY DEEPLY was acceptable but still could have been shortened a little. COLD MOUNTAIN is the worst yet, as what should be a Civil War epic turns out to be a lengthy and often routine melodrama with little to recommend it.Perhaps the novel was at fault too, although as I haven't read it I can't comment. The film is told from the point of view of Jude Law, a wounded soldier whose sole purpose is to get back home to the woman he loves (Nicole Kidman). The film chronicles Law's journey throughout, so why then do we get all the needless boring scenes of Kidman pining for him back home? Just when you thought things couldn't get any worse, in comes Renee Zellweger with a supposedly comedic character and proceeds to reduce it to pantomime level.There are elements to enjoy in COLD MOUNTAIN, not least the battle sequences which are well mounted. Law comes into contact with various characters as the story progresses, some of them engaging (Philip Seymour Hoffman), others less so; Ray Winstone seems particularly underdeveloped in a supporting role. But after a couple of hours or so it all gets rather repetitive, and you wish they'd just get on with it instead of dragging things out so much. The ending is particularly anticlimactic.",4.0,Anonymous,History
I'm A 21 Year Old Guy!   I Don't Cry At Films!!!,"Whilst not perfect, I thought this was a film full of beautiful and moving moments and the simple fact is that I had tears in my eyes at 4 or 5 points during the film and, whatever comments or criticisms I can have, nothing can change the fact that I was deeply moved from this film.I think one of the biggest perceived criticisms of the film (i.e. the fact Inman and Ada barely know each other film) is the very thing that makes it such a beautiful, moving idea.   I really loved the idea that someone could be going through such a terrible time and the only source of hope that I have is not even, as such a person, but the image and idea of a person who they don't even really know.I found Ada's letters to Inman extremely touching and the sense of longing throughout the film is absolutely staggering heart-wrenching although, to be truthful, this sense of longing also does cause problems with the film's end as the hope and longing can never live up to to the final realisation.Elsewhere, Natalie Portman has the single saddest, sweetest moment of the film in a brief but outstanding cameo while Philip Seymour Hoffman adds brilliant comic relief.   Renee Zelwegger must surely be a strong contender for the Best Supporting Actress nods at the Oscars and elsewhere.True, the ending has its problems, true the chemistry between Jude Law and Nicole Kidman does not entirely work and Law gives a strangely muted performance (I don't mean in the sense that the character doesn't speak much, although he doesn't, but that Law does not give as strong an impression as the character as you might expect from such a talented actor).But, when a film is as moving and brilliant in its conveyal of the horrors of war and when I enjoy virtually an entire two and a hour film - I'm a firm believer that there is seldom ANY excuse for making film more than 120 minutes - all quibbles seem minor.",10.0,Anonymous,History
great Renée!!!!,"I believe this is an amazing movie, although not so good as Minghella's masterpiece - THE ENGLISH PATIENT. Jude Law has an astonishing performance, but the real treasure in this film, even more than the story itself, is the one and only Renée Zellweger. There are no words to describe her performance as Ruby Thewes. She brings real life into this film. I think she is the true soul of COLD MOUNTAIN. I really believe she deserved the Oscar she won. I can´t think of nobody who could perform such a though role in such a splendid way. When she is on the screen we completely forget the also great actress Nicole Kidman. If it wasn't for Renée's character this movie would be a bit boring and monotonous. I really think that you should watch this film and see for yourself what I mean.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Each main character is heroic in their own way, but the pivotal character is Ruby(played by Rene' Zelwigger).  If you haven't seen this movie, you will not be bored.

"Unforgettable, unmissable, unbelievable.","Big, sweeping romantic epics don't come along as often as we'd like, so set a date to see this powerful love story set during America's Civil War. From the director of The English Patient, Anthony Minghella, the film focuses on what matters cinematically, such as impressive scenery and artistic, daring camera angles, as well as adapting and delving deep into the heart-warming emotions, originally displayed in Charles Frazier's acclaimed novel. The chemistry between onscreen sweethearts Nicole Kidman and Jude Law is explosively romantic, while Renée Zellweger injects some well-timed humour in amongst the thrills, spills and heartache that wartime love can bring.Although a sombre movie, with numerous explosive scenes full of the best special effects around, cinematically, Cold Mountain is given an authentic look- largely due to the exquisite costumes displayed on screen, exquisitely hand-crafted, and are appropriately suited for the backdrops around them.The actors in the film, all make admirable attempts at capturing the Southern accent. Although their accents are flimsy and inconsistent at times, the variations in speech could be put down to Minghella's creativity and authenticity, and relate to the different cultures and backgrounds at the time.Overall, a terrific romance/war epic, with sensational technical work, horrifically spectacular action, rich characters and a love story to die for.A MUST SEE FOR 2004!",10.0,Anonymous,History
An emotional experience not to be missed,"Cold Mountain is a very moving and powerful movie. I was most impressed with Anthony Minghella's ability to clearly capture the emotional plight of a variety of characters on screen. Jude Law was great as Inman. The internal nature of this character makes this an extremely difficult role, and Jude succeeded most of the time in conveying the emotions of Inman. Nicole Kidman was good but not great in her role as Ada Monroe. I thought the accent and the fact that she is Nicole Kidman made her seem out of place at time, but overall she gives an effective performance. Her transformation and ability to not beg for sympathy from the viewers was most impressive to me. Rene Zellweger really stole the show. She was in total control of her character (Ruby Thewes) and served as not only witty but really spiritual relief. Her character was so complex and well developed it was very easy to forget the fact that she was being played by Rene. The supporting cast (Kathy Baker, Natalie Portman, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Brendan Gleeson, Eileen Adkins) in general was incredible. They really shaped the movie as a whole. Overall I believe the message of this movie came through in a strong and powerful way. A true must see 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Zellweger will win an Oscar for this role,"A very engrossing film of the hardships of the Civil War.  While most films give us a view of the Union side of the war this gives us the opposite, showing that war brings out the worst in everyone but also their best.  Jude Law and Nicole Kidman were good, however I may question the casting of an Aussie to play a southern belle.  Anyway the truly great performance was given by Renee Zellweger.  I base a great performance on whether or not the actor can make you forget about anything else they have ever done (such as Tom Hanks in ""Forrest Gump"") and she did this.  This should ensure Miss Zellweger a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination, her third nomination in as many years I might add.  However this time she will win because this was by far her best performance. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
SUPRISINGLY WARM MOUNTAIN!,"Cold Mountain is just full of suprises. I must say tht I did not completely enjoy this film. But I liked it alot.  I found it to be very creative and involving.  The love story aspect of the film isn't particularly invovlving but what the film does succeed at is showing the loss that war brings on. On all accounts, from loves to families to lands.  The horror of war is very apparent in a film that fills it's moments with constantly changing charachters, weird humor, and a war torn land. Some of the suprise pop ups include Natalie Portman showing her acting chops, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, The sexy guy from 28 days later, the guy from the white stripes and etc. The real reason I went to see Cold Mountain is for Nicole Kidman and although her porcelain presence and timeless acting are just as good as ever. Her role just isn't enough to sustain a real powerful performance. However Renee Zellwegger is the extreme stand out performance, with a rocky sense of humor and times of melodramtic overacting she contains into a heartfelt performance. Hottie Jude Law also does a fine job showing his charachter's complexities as he goes from one emotion to another. From acceptance to despair, from love to hate.  The film takes place during the last quarter of the civil war as Law and Kidman are seperated as he goes off to war. She longs for him as her father dies and he realizes the horrors of war.  She tries to keep the farm in shape as the local villain tries to take it from her, and she slips into lonliness from having no one and nothing. The war takes it tolls on everyone and everything and Renee Zellwegger enters as a young hard working woman whom decides to help Kidman. The only strong chemistry is those formed from friendships. The kidman Law love triste lacks it but they certainly look great together. Making probably the most sexy couple on film of the year! Cold Mountain doesn't draw any real tears besides a watery eye it remains overly warm and even though it's quite depressing it manages to leave you in good reassuring spirits.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Another Beautiful Movie by Anthony Minghella,"Anthony Minghella is not only a great screenwriter, but a beautiful director.  He takes words from a book and allows people to see the emotions we feel.  Kidman, Law and/or Zelleweger may have not been the actors we would have chosen to portray these charcaters, but in a Minghella movie it almost does not matter.  Jude Law who was also in Talented Mr. Ripley, feels not like an actor but the actual characters he play.  I can believe him as Dicky Greenleaf and i can also see him as Iman. Two very different characters played by one actor.  That is the magic of Anthony Minghella",8.0,Anonymous,History
don't care for the romance,"Before the war, Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) and Reverend Monroe (Donald Sutherland) arrive in Cold Mountain, North Carolina. She immediately falls for Inman (Jude Law) and they become sweethearts. In 1864, Union sappers set off a large charge under the Confederate trenches outside of Petersburg where Inman is stationed. Union soldiers charge into the crater and are trapped under heavy Confederate fire. Inman is injured by friendly fire. After reading a letter from Ada, he deserts to go back to Cold Mountain. Meanwhile Ada's father dies and she is unable to work the farm alone without slaves. She is hounded by a home guard soldier. Her neighbor Swangers (Kathy Baker) sends her Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger) to help.The movie starts with a very impressive battle. It is one of the grittiest vision of the ugliness of war. After that, the movie depends on the romance. The overwrought melodramatic romance doesn't strike me with any heat. It is literally the proverbial love at first sight. In great film romances, they spend a little time building to that point. It is usually time well spent. This is no Scarlett and Butler. In fact, Nicole Kidman makes me want to ring her neck like that rooster. The Old South of Cold Mountain before the war is a beautiful lush gentle place with few references to slavery. I guess that's fine although they mention that the Monroes let go of their slaves. It seems like a good thing to put on screen. Inman's journey seems fascinating but very random. Renée Zellweger may have won the Academy Awards but it's a bracing performance next to Kidman's. Overall, there are interesting scenes but most of all, I find the romance rather uninspired. This is no 'Gone With the Wind'.",5.0,Anonymous,History

Renee actually ""stole"" the movie, and most certainly was deserving of the Academy Award. It was brutal, it was tender and, it was one of the best motion pictures I have seen. The Civil War was far from ""civil"", with American's killing American's, American's destroying American cities, but this movie was totally different in its message.

Contemplation, love and faith - these are the feelings that permeate the entire film from beginning to end and make the viewer worry. One kiss can lead to an eternal love. Of course, this only happens in fairy tales and movies. But in two and a half hours you don't doubt the sincerity of the characters' feelings.The love story is mixed with the horrors of war and violence. What did the southerners fight for? For everything to end, and not for political dogmas. At the same time, you understand the value of men. Such versatile love is shown that you plunge into it headlong and involuntarily gasp at the sight of suffering, flinch at the sound of a shot...A very sensual film.

"Much better than I expected.. I mean, WOW","Cold Mountain was such a great movie! In fact, it's my favorite movie of the year, maybe even my favorite movie of all time. It was almost perfect, with the great directing and amazing performances. Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zelwegger make a magnificent team. They did such a great job that affected the movie in a good way.I don't know why people were saying that Law and Kidman lacked chemistry in the movie. I thought they had a perfectly good chemistry in the movie that made it even better. Jude Law really surprised me on this one. I never knew he had the talent to pull this off. I thought he was perfectly cast. I can't imagine Tom Cruise (who was supposed to play Inman) to play this role. Jude deserves an Oscar nomination for this performance of a lifetime.Nicole Kidman, on the other hand, was also good, although I liked her better in Moulin Rouge and The Hours. She delivered a great performance, as usual, but  she kinda messed up on her southern accent. Renee Zelwegger HAS to win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for this movie. She just HAS to. She was perfect as Ruby Thewes. Natalie Portman, in my opinion, delivered her best performance so far in her career. You can actually feel her pain and her love for her husband, who died in the war, and her baby (who was, by the way, HUGE!). I think that Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zelwegger all deserve Oscar nominations, and hopefully wins.Ok, about the love scene. It was... um.. weird and confusing. It's not like any love scenes you see in other movies. It was confusing too because one moment they're standing up and Nicole is naked, next they're lying down and Nicole isn't naked. Then they're standing again and she's naked, then they're lying and she's not naked. blah blah blah. I dunno about the love scene. I thought that it was uneccessary to show Nicole's butt twice. I didn't see the reason or the point of showing it.Anyway, I liked this movie because you can relate to Inman as he travels home to Ada. You can tell that he's really, really, really, really, really in love with Ada, and vice versa. It was amazing how they didn't lose hope and how they remained faithful to each other even though they only shared three or four moments at the beginning. And that kiss. That kiss looked... WOW. I'd kiss Jude in a heartbeat. It was that kiss that helped him survive through the war, and with the help of Ada's picture.This movie deserves all eight nominations it got for the Golden Globes.

I can't blame the director for the ending, that's the author's contrivance, but that's what it is, utterly predictable, hokey and contrived.

I Got Punk'd,"Actually I had major doubts about watching this movie, but when I saw the trailer, I though that it was going to be awesome. Unfortunately the trailer contained ALL the best scenes from this extremely long movie! I wasn't aware of that & naively thought, the movie could offer me something more.What I totally hated is that there was ONLY ONE battle scene in the movie!!! The one which was going on for something like 5 minutes & was shown in the trailer! Yep, no more battle scenes for the entire 2 & half hour movie about the civil war! What the hell? Is Miramax in such bad financial state? Couldn't it have afforded battle scenes or what?Apparently most of the money was spent on the actors' salaries. Yeah, money well spent, since most actors in this movie couldn't do the most important thing - portray credible characters! Yeah, they were all wonderful at moaning, whining, crying & expressing different emotions. But did they manage to make us viewers believe that depicted characters could have existed in real? NO! The acting was very emotional in the beginning & got simply pathetic by the end of the flick. The only one, who's done her job well was Renee Zellweger!!! Her acting was awesome & it was the ONLY thing I enjoyed about Cold Mountain!!!The movie is based on the book, which I haven't read, so maybe I ain't gonna be very fair. But to me the story seemed to be quite sappy. It featured some goofs & stupid plot lines. It would be OK, if the actors were able to play believably, but they couldn't & all the flaws became evident to the viewers.Maybe the direction is to be blamed on such far-fetched performance. The movie focuses too much on emotions, but it sometimes doesn't make sense. Apparently, the idea was to show the misery of civil citizens, who suffered the terrible consequences of war. The director failed to do this. The main character is running through the woods & swamps occasionally coming across some civil personages, who are mostly weird & don't meet sympathy from viewers.To sum up, the flick appeared a far-fetched, pathetic,unpatriotic, cheap anti-war crap to me. And if to be honest, I felt some compassion towards the characters in the beginning, but by the end of it I could care less, because of terrible direction & over-acting. The movie has some clear anti-war trend, but it seems ludicrous, cause the war itself wasn't even shown well enough .According to the trailer, it was gonna be an uplifting patriotic film with vivid breathtaking battle scenes. In real, it sucked. I got punk'd. But I guess, it was my fault. I should have read the book at first.P.S.: Harvey what Oscar award are you talking about?

Much more vivid and enthralling than the book,"I read the book and found it tedious.  The movie, though, is magnificent. The author, Charles Frazier, seems like one of these guys who really gets into describing everything--each action, each button, each leaf.  As well as the thoughts of the characters about these items.  Now, part of the plot is about the importance of knowing the names of things (Ruby knows the names of everything; Ada knows the names of nothing; Ada becomes one with her new land when she knows what things are called).  But reading this stuff was a horror, while watching it played out in widescreen technicolor with wonderful actors made it a fascinating element of a grand movie.The battle scene in the book is practically un-envisioned.  It's a vague memory in the mind of Inman, which he wants to forget.  The directors wisely decided to include a battle scene, and it is one of the best ever.  Two segments in particular--where the US troops appear out of the smoke, and where the troops get trapped in a ditch and a ""turkey shoot"" begins--are among the best I've ever seen.Visualizing the battle scenes makes the character of Inman seem so much more real.  You get a full sense of the horror he's experienced.  All his other actions afterward are understandable and seem trivial compared with the horror that happened all around him.The book did one scenario a lot better than the flick:  Inman's transition from a soldier to a deserter is poetic in the book, mundane in the movie. Inman is in a hospital, looking out the window toward Cold Mountain.  One day, he feels that he must go back to Cold Mountain.  He wills himself from the hospital room out into the world beyond the window.  The window goes from a frame for something distant, to a gateway to Inman's new reality. The movie treats this as an ordinary escape from captivity to a tenuous freedom, whereas the book made it magic.But the movie has so much other magic--it contains the best Phillip Seymour Hoffman performance ever--he's the perfect clergyman with  no scruples. Eileen Atkins as the frontier woman who can fend for herself is memorable.Especially great was Rene Zellwegger--it's a role meant for Mary Steenburgen or Holly Hunter, and she plays it to perfection. It's hard to believe she was ever the star of a splashy musical.  She embodies the self-sufficient country woman, and deserves Oscar No. 2.",10.0,Anonymous,History

I could not believe how sappy the story was, not a shred of originality even the photography was mediocre. Go see it if you like over the top mush and typical Hollywood tripe!",4.0,Anonymous,History
Stunning film!,"This movie is set for release to DVD/VHS on Tuesday, June 29th. I work for a major chain video store and I'm able to view movies prior to release in order to make recommendations to customers. I missed this in the theaters but just finished watching it on DVD a second time!I watched it TWICE in two days because I wanted to catch what I may have missed the first time. The scenery is gorgeous, the major battle scene is epic and despite what an earlier comment states, the love story is totally believable.Yes, the two principals, Ada (Nicole Kidman) and Inman (Jude Law) only share a few words and glances but the spark is ignited before Inman marches off to war with the rest of the able-bodied young men of Cold Mountain. The thought of the possibilities of that love is what carries Ada and Inman through the most difficult times in their separate lives. It's a dream, a hope that some day things will be better if they are ever reunited and that together, there is a future even though the war and the resultant circumstances have changed them both forever.Ada writes to Inman constantly although he actually only receives three of her letters but they are most precious to him and he reads and re-reads them every chance he gets to help keep him sane in insane times. He never writes her back although he composes his own letters in his head (heard in voice-overs) because he feels that the war has changed him too much and he is not the same as when he left her. He is injured and recuperating in a hospital when he is outside one day to enjoy the sun and he decides to go back to her (one of her letters pleads with him to stop whatever he is doing and just ""Come back to me. Come back to me."") He simply starts walking even though soldiers are warned to stay on the hospital grounds.Inman's adventures as he makes his way back to Ada and Cold Mountain are strongly reminiscent of Homer's ""Odyssey"", complete with a long time away from home due to a war hundreds of miles from home, suitors angling for Ada/Penelope's hand and land, Sirens and a person who takes care of Inman/Odysseus in a hut in the wilderness.A separate disc is PACKED with Special Features that only added to my enjoyment of the DVD, including a segment/special called ""The Words and Music of Cold Mountain"". In this special, director Anthony Minghella is interviewed about the process of bring the movie to life, Sting reads part of a chapter of the book (yes, it was a BOOK before it was a movie) and Jack White (who plays ""Georgia"" in the film) performs some of the lonesome bluegrass music heard in the film.The acting is superb; Renee Zellweger more than deserves her Supporting Actress Golden Globe and Oscar and it's too bad Nicole Kidman while nominated for a Golden Globe was overlooked at the Oscars. (Charlize Theron won both for ""Monster"".) Jude Law is excellent, too. I much preferred his performance over Sean Penn in ""Mystic River"" (Oscar) and Bill Murray in ""Lost in Translation"" (Golden Globe).All told a great movie. I highly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"Fine Scenery, But Overtly Boring","Many people sing arias about this monster of a movie, as they say. They told me many times it was a masterwork of pure art, as grand as The English Patient was. Well, for the start, I do not enjoy the Patient movie. Sorry. Cold Mountain was a yawning boredom almost all 3 hours. I waited for the famous Crater attack scene. It was shown. Not true, not as it was in reality. I wanted a Civil War movie and got a messed melodrama with very slow and poorly acting Nicole Kidman, very funny (the best there) Renee Z., and then, Jude Law. He was not good for his part. He was far too weak for that tremendously challenging character. So, even the parts of Donald Sutherland or Phillip Seymour Hoffman did not save this film from the abyss of boredom. Sometimes, it was OK, especially in battle or shoot-out scenes, but mostly - slow, deliberate and unnatural. There are many goofs, many historical inaccuracies for Civil War buffs' horror. Generally, it was a languid, prolonged, unnecessary dirty movie, which did not even come close an inch to masterworks like Gettysburg or alike. Sorry, it was not great.",2.0,Anonymous,History
This movie was just plain good.,"Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zellweger all put a great deal of effort into this film and it has paid off well. I think critics will agree that Law is one of the better actors in this 21st century... oh yeah, and not bad at the box office either. Inman really seems like a reasonably realistic person of the time. The only problem in my mind, is would even a woman of the civil war times stick around for a man who she has seen for a very brief period of time and has kissed only once? That struck me as odd, but in the long run... I was not dissapointed when my sister dragged me into this one. B+ for this one.",9.0,Anonymous,History
This is why I go to the movies - NOT FOR ESCAPISM...,"After all the fuss over 'Lord of the Rings' and everything else out over the the Christmas period - you know all the films that people see in droves to try and escape from their reality? It was so nice to see 'Cold Mountain' a couple of days ago.Yes it's pretty morbid but does have touches of humour. And when you have a great lead cast and an amazing supporting cast giving some very strong performances, plus some lush cinematography and a compelling story, how can you complain?I like the fact that there's something deeper happening here with the characters other than the love story. But unlike 'Titanic', 'Cold Mountain' isn't a Hollywood love story, it's a story about survival and Law and Kidman are very convincing here - they also heat up the screen too towards the end. Plus Kathy Baker, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Jena Melone (in a very small role), Natalie Portman (reminding us after 2 'Star Wars' films that she CAN act) and Rene Zellwegger, I came out full filled. This is a film about 'us' and anyone who says it's too bloody needs a reality check because this is what life was like and for all we know could be like it again some day.I don't think anyone will come out of 'Cold Mountain' saying, ""that was just a bit of fun... harmless entertainment"" but I think it's impossible to come out thinking that you haven't just seen a film of very high quality both in production values and in terms of story. If you want your movies sugar coated, then by all means, go spend another 3 hours and see 'Return of the King' again.If you didn't like 'The English Patient' or 'The Talented Mr. Ripley', then you might not like this film as all three are by the same writer/director, but if you enjoy seeing some real characters in real situations, this movie could be what you're looking for.8 OUT OF 10",8.0,Anonymous,History
Leaves you warm!,"I have a message for Ms. Renee Z~ you stole the show, girl!

I was extremely curious about the ending as it relates to Frazier's breath-holding epic, and actually stopped breathing at the moment of reckoning!The ""characters along the way"" were superb; although it's been about 5 years since I read the novel, Ms. Portman brought her situation rushing back to me.  I couldn't help wishing something different for she and the blanket-conscious soldier, but as a product of both the North and South, I'm used to such confusion.This movie is **not** an ""Ah, I'll rent it!""

Prepare to cry some tears,"Amidst the ridiculous movies of our time: violence, sci-fi... going back in time, getting your memory wiped and other stupid plots, Cold Mountain brings a monstrous movie to the screen. Although I do admit that the plot has been performed many many times before, Anthony Minghella is able to bring in different aspects to keep the story unique. The story does not only focus on the main love plot and the viewer is not over-stuffed with tacky romance and cheesy catch phrases. The entire time I watched this movie all i wanted was for Nicole Kidman and Jude Law's characters to get together. Both deliver amazing performances, and as always, Jude Law looks immaculate and Nicole Kidman is able to make the audience cry with just one look. The surprising actress for me was Renee Zelwegger. Having mostly seen her in comedic roles, I did not expect much from her. Her performance, however, is simple but extremely powerful. Although I admit that I did cry the entire movie, and through the credits, the movie is beautifully presented and pain-stakingly desperate love story. Some may say that this has been done before, but with the amazing cast and unique directing, there are many factors that set this movie apart from the rest. I say: watch it! And don't worry about crying or feeling that little squirm deep inside of you. This is a pure love story, but a truly incredulous one. I would watch it a million times over... and still cry!",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Many great filmmaking qualities, but the melodrama of it's love story is annoying!","`Cold Mountain' is one of those tragic love stories that director Anthony Minghella loves, like his Oscar winning film, `The English Patient.' However, unlike `The English Patient,' one does not feel swept away in the grandeur of the love story. `Cold Mountain' plays out like an overemotional romance novel turned film. Still, I cannot deny that the film has many great filmmaking qualities that to down it would be unfair. This movie is marvelous for its cinematography, direction, performances, and musical score. The film is based on the book by Charles Frazier. 	`Cold Mountain' opens with a stunning battle scene during the Civil War in which one of the characters, Inman (Jude Law) is wounded. While in hospital, he is read a letter from his lover, Ada (Nicole Kidman), back home in Cold Moutain by a nurse. Ada's final comment was `come back to me,' so he deserts the Confederate Army and begins his trek home. On the way, he is troubled by the memories he has of Ada, as they have only met on a few occasions but have become infatuated with each other. The same is true for Ada-she is so consumed with grief that she spends more time writing him letters and pining over him than she does taking care of her farm. On the way home, Inman meets many colorful characters that give him aid, or slow him down. One of which was Reverend Veasey (Philip Seymour Hoffman) whose piety and bad habits do not mix. As for Ada, a young woman named Ruby (Renee Zellweger) approaches her. Ruby has a cocky attitude and hardy nature that bring about some of the film's more whimsical moments. She wants nothing more from Ada than a home and food. The two agree and get the farm back in order. But there are problems in Cold Mountain-the sheriff is on a mission to kill anyone who may harbor deserters of the Confederacy. Ada, Ruby, and Inman will have to face the righteousness of the law before all is said and done. I was not impressed by Reverend Veasey's character, regardless of Hoffman's excellent performance. He added distaste to the film when at that point it was based on noble characters. However, Inman also met two other women during his travels. One of them was named Sara (Natalie Portman), a woman whose husband had died and she was now alone to fend for herself and her newborn son. Portman portrays her grief so effectively that it pulls at the audience's heart. Especially during a scene when she asks Inman to sleep in her bed with her so she will not be alone. Nothing sexual occurs, but it was a nice touch to give this woman something to feel after she had been alone for so long. Another interesting character that Inman meets is an elderly woman named Maddy (Eileen Atkins) who looks after him-she lives in the woods, in a shack and raises goats. She provides Inman with medicine and food for his journey. What's more, she also provides understanding of Inman's heartache for his beloved. `Cold Mountain's' one weakness is its melodrama-it becomes irritating at times and one cannot help but want it to end. In one scene, Ada and Inman confess their love and want to get married by saying `I'll marry you' three times, as they do in some strange land unknown to them. Give me a break! It is a good thing that the film can fall back on so much filmmaking majesty as opposed to its overbearing love story. ***1/2",9.0,Anonymous,History

Deserters Are Good; Catching Them Is Bad,"I found the first 90 minutes of this film to be very interesting, even though a few parts of it were ridiculous (i.e.. Philip Seymour Hoffman's character). The last 60 minutes were distasteful and I began to lose interest in the film. The last hour lasted forever, it seemed.The movie is nicely acted and I can see why Rene Zellweger won an Academy Award since her character was so interesting. The movie also is beautifully filmed and the story is an emotional one. However, I found the message to be a bad one: not surprising these days in Hollywood. In this story, ""Inman"" (Jude Law) deserts the Confederate Army during the Civil War. His reason: his girlfriend misses him and wants him home. He's also getting disillusioned with war. (Can you imagine if every soldier who was in a similar boat deserted the army in the two world wars??!)Yet, in this film of course, all of that is perfectly acceptable. Then again, what Liberal filmmaker has ever had a nice thing to say about the U.S. military?? To add to their left-wing slant, they portray a vigilante-like posse going after deserters as cold-blooded sick killers. Well, in the world of films, as we know: good is portrayed as bad and bad is good.....and only Liberals would portray deserters as heroes.",3.0,Anonymous,History
A Whiter Shade of Pale,"Anyone of colour in this movie is relegated to `walk-on, walk-off' or `drop dead and stay that way' roles.  Even `Gone With the Wind' managed to convey less on-screen apartheid.  This is a movie about white people and white peoples' preoccupations in a war being fought essentially over the rights of black people.  So where are they? We understand in a phrase or two that Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) owns slaves; she uses their unseen presence as an excuse to talk with Inman (Jude Law).  Then, much later, in a toss-off sentence, we understand that she freed them. How very liberal. In the beginning, all the men are happy that they got their war.  But what are they fighting for?  Later, Inman walk away from `a cause he no longer believes in', but what was that cause?  I believe that the purpose of this vagueness is to keep audience sympathy with the main characters who are fighting  this war to preserve states rights and to OWN SLAVES. A braver film maker would have conveyed these paradoxes, not been afraid of them.The life of non-slave owning rural whites (and let us remember that they were the majority of the Southern population) is portrayed realistically as one of semi-literacy and hard-labour,  punctuated by  fervent and musical religious expression. The scenery is beautiful, Nicole is beautiful, Jude is beautiful (even when he's ugly).  Their relationship, founded on a few glances and even fewer words, lasts an Odyssey of time and travel.  Frankly, I believed it.  The privileged upbringing of Ada, alluded to by her dress and deportment and later on by her incompetence at anything practical, would have predisposed her to this very passionate, frustrating attachment. The type of fiction she would have read (we hear her reading `Wuthering Heights' aloud to Ruby Thewes (Renée Zellweger) is all about intense, thwarted passion.  But Ms. Kidman is a superstar and has arrived at that place where all I can see is Nicole Kidman and not the character she wishes to portray. Ms.Zellweger finally convinces me that she can act and steals every scene in which she appears.  Jude Law is soon to arrive at that superstar category where he can only be `Jude Law', but thank God, he isn't there yet. He's wonderful.The opening battle sequence is justifiably famous and will be the new benchmark for period war filming.Let me mention the music in this movie which is a true highlight.  Powerful, evocative and, for anyone who isn't familiar with Sacred Harp (Fasola), a revelation.The book( and I urge everyone to read it) was a wonderful read BUT the movie is not the book.  Judge the movie as a separate, independent work.  I have no patience with people who cry `But the book was so different'.  Of course the book is different; it's a different medium. If anyone is at all interested in the period, I would suggest they read `The Civil War Diaries of Mary Chestnut', a work of non-fiction written by someone who was there and at the very top of the social heap. Her take on the slavery question is very interesting.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Hollywood's Civil War Executed with Commanding Skill,"Oscar nominations for ""Cold Mountain"" are assured.  It's a sweeping micro-epic of the Civil War and it succeeds where other recent sprawling films about the great internecine conflict, ""Gods and Generals"" for example, fail.  And the reason why it holds viewers' attention through two and a half hours is that it focuses on relationships - good, bad and homicidal - rather than on the great battles and still controversial generals from that conflict.  Unlike ""Gettysburg"" and ""Gods and Generals"" we can all sit back in comfort and not debate or challenge whether Lee knew his business, a subject that prompts vigorous personal exchanges both North and South to this date.Based on Charles Frazier's outstanding novel of the same name ""Cold Mountain"" tracks Inman, Jude Law, a young, taciturn laborer falling in love with Ada, Nicole Kidman, as all in the small hilly North Carolina town await the act of secession that will lead to war.Australian-actress-of-any-accent-needed Kidman is marvelous as Ada who falls in love with Inman (no first name) before he joins his friends to march off to a jolly war guaranteed to be over in a short time.  Inman, of course, has fallen for the preacher's blond and beautiful daughter.  They exchange tintypes (an early form of photography).  Donald Sutherland is the clergyman and he delivers an expectedly competent and familiar performance.Inman does not have, as the English might say, ""a good war.""  He is present - up front and personal - when the Army of the Potomac launches one of the great disasters of its march on Richmond, the mining of Confederate lines before Petersburg.  A curiosity:  the slaughter of Union troops trapped in the Crater following the explosion is quite accurately depicted.  But the troops sent in were largely black and inexperienced and here they're all white.  Why so obvious a distortion of a horrific event? (Incidentally, the white brigadier general who commanded the black troops was hiding in his quarters behind the lines dead drunk while his men perished. Since the whole misbegotten, failed operation was an enormous embarrassment to generals Grant and Meade and the main Union casualties were just blacks, the drunk was quietly dismissed rather than being shot.)Inman survives a grievous wound and, barely recovered, he decides to check out of the Army of Northern Virginia and hike home.  To Ada, of course.On his journey he has many adventures most of which could have been fatal. He meets and makes and loses friends.  He meets and eludes or dispatches foes.  Jude Law is man with a grim determination that impresses and engrosses.  His pain becomes the audience's.  That's a compliment about how well he wears his role.Meanwhile, back at the farm, literally, Ada has taken in as a partner, not a servant, Ruby, played with insouciance bordering on the hopelessly comedic, by Reneee Zellweger.  There must be a reason why a large part of the audience broke out laughing when Ruby makes her first appearance in an unfolding set of scenes that has humor but also pathos.All is not well in the environs of Cold Mountain where law and order seems to have been exclusively delegated to a small crew of Home Guard vigilantes whose cruelty and mindless killing polarizes the characters.    There were vigilantes hunting Union sympathizers and Confederate deserters, especially at the tail end of the war,  but this crew is off the charts.  I don't think anyone in the theater liked them. I hope not. The actors are excellent in an expectedly stereotyped portrayal. Forget Manhattan, they won't be cheered in the Deep South.  I think.A short but intensely emotional performance is Natalie Portman's as the Confederate widow, Sara, alone in her forest cabin with her little baby when first Inman and then a trio of Union soldiers arrive.  Portman is believable and moving.  She is Everywoman who is victimized by conflicts men fight and women and children pay for with if not their lives, their welfare.Curiously, except perhaps for Florida which fell to Union forces early in the conflict, North Carolina saw little actual combat (the one significant battle in that state, Bentonville, was near the end of the war).  The privations that occupy much of the screen time were common as the war drew to its disastrous close for the rebels but in North Carolina things were largely better than elsewhere.Director and screenplay writer Anthony Minghella crafted a surprisingly taut drama given its length and the complexity of interactions by numerous characters.  The cinematography is excellent-the movie was shot in Romania which, it's been reported, looks more like North Carolina in 1864 than any part of that state does today.  I'm not sure if that's good for Romanians.General Sherman said that ""War is hell and you can not refine it."" Hollywood has grappled with the dilemma of capturing America's war that is still being fought over 140 years later.  D.W. Griffith was the first prominent director to deal with the war and its issues and the celluloid avalanche hasn't stopped.  ""Cold Mountain"" will achieve success throughout the country because it has truly terrible characters on both sides, avoids any real discussion of root issues such as slavery and shows kindness to slaves (Ava's willingness to go out in the rain to deliver cider to the slave quarters during a big party is almost enough to make one wonder what the fuss was all about).  The war in ""Cold Mountain is brutal as it affects individuals and meaningless as a recounting of a conflict without comparison in our history. So general audience acceptance north and south of the Mason-Dixon Line (meaning box office receipts) is assured.But it is a very good, not a great movie, largely because of the intensity of Law's and Kidman's acting.  And we'll be seeing white-knuckled cast members in the audience at Oscar time.  Trust me on that.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,History
cold mountain,"Anthony Mingella has captured the reality and feeling during the civil war. Although i have never read the book, i enjoyed watching the film. It made me think from the characters point of view and what it would have felt like for them,and what they would have felt.An effect which really caught my eye was how the first hour of the film was set in flashback. The dramatic change from violence in battle scenes to peace and tranquility back in cold moutain had an amazing effect on me and really caught my eye. It's as if Inman (jude law) is fighting on and on then thinking back on how life was before the war and each flashback holds more regret that Inman had signed up for the war in the first place.One thing that isn't so good about this film is that it drags on in places and is really a bit to long. People don't want to sit and watch a film for 2 and a half hour straight. As a 14 year old, i am not one to sit and concentrate on a certain subject for as long as 2 and a half hours. After about an hour and a half i begin to get bored and cold mountain is a film that needs full concentration right the way through.When ruby (renee zellweger) is entered into the film, it all of a sudden becomes more interesting and exciting. She manages to keep the film on a top level as she is entertaining. With renee zellweger, cold mountain would be slightly boring and highly stereotypical. I am a huge fan of renee and believe cold mountain is one of the best pieces of work she has done. Well done renee!!!!!!! Nicole Kidman plays the part of Ada very well. She is consistent through out and her acting typically fits her costume. Despite this, the chemistry between her and Inman (jude law) could have been much stronger. It seems a bit unreal that somebody would wait for four years to see the person they don't even know and only saw a few times and kissed once.Overall i think this film has been wonderfully casted and directed. Despite all of the bad things i have pointed out on this review, it is expected to be mistakes in a film on this subject. It was on of the most critical moments in American history. If somebody gave you the book of cold mountain and said "" Read this book and make a film on it. "" Would you be able to make a film anywhere near the quality that Anthony Mingella has produced? It was a big ask for him and therefore i believe he has done a fantastic job.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Simply pathetic,"There is nothing worth your time about this movie. It simply sucked! with a boring and pointless story, over-acting, over-dramatization with prolonged, superficial and over the top romantic exchanges. As for directing, well...it had to be bad to put together such a lousy product. There was absolutely no true romantic chemistry between Kidman and Law, nor was there any build up for their relationship. I did not feel connected to any of the characters, and there were way too many of them with very short life span, as if the director was trying to con us into liking the movie based on its size. The movie did not move me in any way. It didn't make me feel sad, funny, excited, or entertained. I simply didn't care. Rarely has a movie made me feel so indifferent about its plot or any of its characters. It is worse than day-time soap operas.

Worth watching,"Jude Law was great in this movie, his best performance IMO, and he really carried it. Conversely it was Nicole Kidman's worst performance, she made her character come across as pretentious and annoying, although she improved a bit toward the end as she learned to be self reliant instead of making others wait on her hand and foot. Her fake high-pitched ""Southern"" voice never went away though came across as bad acting.Extras were all cringey but the side characters like Philip Seymour Hoffman and Giovanni Ribisi also carried it. Writing was awful. Dear God who wrote this love story, I'm a huge fan of romance but several lines and scenes made me actually cringe.Otherwise a really good movie.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Just a nice film,"And I do not mean to be belittling with the title. Is this a historically correct, Oscar winning masterpiece that filmsyidents will be studying in a 100 year...no. But that is the worst that Can be said about it. Nicole Kidman and Renee zelwegger make a delightful couple of misfits off the opposite end. They bring humor in what would otherwise be a tearjecking tragedy. The romance is believable if you consider the lack of choice and the hard times. It is a realistic portrait of war. There is a moral about how harsh conditions bring out the best and worst in people. It is not a happy end and yet it is. The photography is beautiful yet gruesome. So why do I call this ' just a nice movie'? Because it doesn't go to extremes. The acting is good but not perfect, the story works and has a good tempo but is not mind blowing. The photography is beautifull but not sophisticated. There is a moral but it doesn't break down any doors. It is a well balanced, easy going, beautifully directed movie that has you engaged but not on the edge of your seat. It doesn't always have to be a masterpiece or a cult classic.

Beautiful and Sad,"Liking Jude Law has been elevated to the level of national pastime among my demographic. The last few movies I've seen him in, he was in his clever fop mode, and I started losing sight of why. In this movie, he was different. Spectacularly different. I never watched this movie when it came out, because I thought it was going to be sappy. It was not. The reason is Jude Law and his fierce, raw performance as the soldier dude who leaves the confederate army after coming back from the brink of death from a gunshot. He leaves to walk a thousand miles through a war zone, avoiding the home guard who want to put him back in the army. The reason he walks is Nicole Kidman, the awkward and beautiful belle he left back home in Cold Mountain, was being harassed by locals and starved by the war. She wrote him a letter telling him she needed him back.It's rare when two actors can make love at first sight work on screen. These do.Another reason I didn't watch it was that I have an irrational dislike for Renee Zellwegger and she got so much attention for her role, which I thought would be too precious. It was a little precious, but also was hilarious. In this very dark movie, which had me crying a bunch of times, it was a welcome bit of levity.I'm glad I watched it finally. Wouldn't want to do it again soon, because of the wrenching sadness. In the ethos of this movie, there are more than two sides in a war, and none of them are good. The victims are the soldiers, the civilians, and everyone affected by the changed rules of war. ""Hey, there's a war on,"" is an excuse for a lot of sick injustice, and that doesn't ever seem to change.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Major Disappointment,"The 4 I give this is because there is some good camera work & photography in this. The problem is too much license was taken from realism with the story. The sex sequences are absurd considering the historic era the film was staged in (the Civil War). Nicole Kidman isn't even given enough script to work with but there is no surprise with this considering the writers could not even get the history right.Anyone somewhat knowing of the era would consider some of the out door sequences to be absurd. Things are done which are totally out of context or totally out of sequence.The scenery is the films strong point, the rest of it is a pretty lame effort. The film tries to make up for script weakness with scenery and length but the extra length does not really help either. Think a better script was deserved by all those involved.",4.0,Anonymous,History
"Guys, let her talk you into seeing Cold Mountain","This is a movie for guys who like movies. Like ""Cool Hand Luke"", only with actual American girls included. A movie is such a huge collaboration between artists, far beyond my understanding; but Cold Mountain is a remarkable effort on the parts of some talented people. The production, the direction and the acting are greater than the sum of their parts. The camera work, the editing, the costumes and ESPECIALLY the sets get top marks. The script is good.The Actors are great, save a small caveat. Some (not all) of the bad guys (and there are lots of bad guys in this movie) play the heavy a little too heavy. Not over the top, but just a little too mean AND evil at the same time, you know? Part of that probably comes from the way the characters and their actions were written in the original novel, and some of it comes from the age old problem of basically decent human beings playing (and directing) the role of sick, demented, evil human beings, and not really having anything in their own life experiences to base something like that on. I am not referring to Ray Winstones performance as Teague, I thought he was great. Very believable that you can dislike someone without being able to put your finger on why at first. A real trick to play that character and have the audience feel the distrust without the words and/or actions to substantiate that emotion.There isn't a female actor in this movie that doesn't do an OUTSTANDING job. Nicole Kidman is stunning, she has never been more attractive than in Cold Mountain. Renee Zellweger is brilliant.

Basic human values laid bare - for those with the time and inclination to explore them.,"A slightly narratively-divided tale of how America was torn apart by civil war using the device of two people (Inman and Ada) that want to be together despite all that has happened.This is a classic case of a movie which you can either get inside and consider a minor classic (as I do) or one that you get left outside of. In which case you may well use puns based on the word ""cold"". I think the IMDb reviews reflect that.What is amazing is that some of the serious UK press gave this a drubbing and the kind of ratings you would expect for X Men 13. If cinema is going to be a serious art form then it needs movies like this. Big money has been spent on what might be (crudely) called quality art-house with mainstream players.Not that it is perfect: Anthony Minghella has a tendency to spend a long time emoting and explaining when the actions and motives of the main players are already clear. War is hell and being on the losing side of a war is an even greater hell. Like Francis Ford Copolla - he tends to linger on a scene long after a point has been made or an action has occurred.America has never looked kindly at country people. It has a culture that is urban based and urban-basting. In cinema often a bunch of inbreed hillbillies that cannot be trusted. Growing food will never be hip and trendy and let's not pretend there is any chance of a makeover. The historical nature of this production doesn't change a thing.The concept of lovers torn apart (by war) is not new, nor is strong women that can cope on their own. There is plenty of cod drama here (fights, war, chase, capture, life-and-death struggles, etc.) but it has a proper setting. Tragic scenes are followed by happy scenes - because that is how life is and was.I thought all the main players were good. Nicole Kidman might have been a bit too pretty and made up at times and Renee Zellweger a bit over-the-top crude, but they worked well off each other. Jude Law has the kind of face (and hollow look) that the camera can focus on for long periods without him doing a lot. He is almost in another movie as he tries to fight his way home.Congratulations to Miramax for putting up so much money to make a risk piece - I hope you got your money back so you can invest it in more quality productions. Cinema that is worth the entrance money and that can send you away moved.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Not so great,"Usually with a movie like this the complaint would be that it's too slow. But in Cold Mountain, things really move too quickly. I did not have much time to know these characters and build empathy. Jude Law's character survived so long because of so many people helping him, but he never seems to care about this. He was supposed to be broken down on his journey, but apathy by others would do this. Some people were uncaring, but so many were kind.The scenes with Natalie Portman, the strongest in the movie, also show its weakness. She helps him and he just leaves her. 'Good luck with the sick baby, but I've got to get back to Cold Mountain. My girlfriend's there with that dude from The White Stripes.' Speaking of whom, Jack White is another of the film's strengths, along with all of the music. The soundtrack was good throughout.Renee Zellweger on the other hand is simply annoying. And she won an Oscar? Holly Hunter was robbed! The movie simply seemed disjointed. Usually I love barren, gray scenery, but in this case it did nothing for me. And how is it that Liberal Hollywood keeps making movies sympathizing with the slave-owning South. From Gone with the Wind to The Outlaw Josey Wales to Cold Mountain, Glory being a notable exception, the Confederates are the heroes, or at least the ones who are supposed to hold our sympathies. Yes, most people in the South did not have slaves, but they were pro-slavery and wanted to keep it that way. And Hollywood seems fine with this.",,Anonymous,History
Bitter-sweet drama.,"Starts of a bit hokey but develops into a hard core drama. When a film grows like this it reflects the human experience of learning and life unfolding. Sometimes we don't grow, sometimes we do. Here they do quite a lot. Impressive encapsulation of the process of life. Only annoying thing was the preponderance of Hollywood stars featuring as the timeline progresses. Yes they do a good job but the familiarity was slightly distracting.

Still Love This Film,"It is and will be one of my favorites. All cast members gave stellar performances. The Soundtrack was good also. Jack White should have been in more films after. His role wasn't large but what he did felt natural. The only thing that gets on my nerves in this film re Hollywood is the typical actors ""go to"" gimmick. In this case it would be Renee Zellweger's attempt at a pouty mouth and overly circled lips as Julia Roberts has the obnoxious laugh they force these gimmicks into almost all films. Other than that, I've not got a bad thing to say about it. It was Charlie Hunnam's best American accent yet.

Good view of Cold Mountain!,"Almost every freeze frame of the epic `Cold Mountain' is encompassed with ravishing cinematography, an authentic art direction, and a heart-rending musical score. Those are definitely the hot properties of `Cold Mountain'. Jude Law stars as Inman, a Civil War soldier who is on an enduring journey to Cold Mountain to reunite with his love- Ada Monroe.  Ada is played by newcomer Nicole Kidman. Just a little kidman kidding!   Part of `Cold Mountain' revolves around the series of adventures that Inman is confronted with on his journey, which very much resembles `Homer's Odyssey'. The other side of the mountain focuses on Ada's desperation for her Inman to return, and the friendship she develops with the tough grassroots southern farmgirl Ruby- here played with dynamism by Renee Zellweger. Director Anthony Minghella continues to prove that he is mountains above many other directors as far as adapting epic literary works into major motion pictures. However, I must give the cold shoulder to the screenplay of  `Cold Mountain. It was a bit falsifying and way too melodramatic. Nevertheless, `Cold Mountain' is high enough with positive attributes for you to climb on to. **** Good",8.0,Anonymous,History
More like Dullsville.,"This is probably my shortest ever review for any film.There is one spectacular battle at the start: grim, grimy and grueling and showing what war means: death all around. Technically well done, but nothing new. Quite a few war films in the last twenty years showed it equally well, or better: Apocalypse Now (1979), Platoon (1986), Full Metal Jacket (1987), The Thin Red Line (1998). Whew, even Gone With The Wind (1939) is a far better story.This movie is death to the senses, however, because it's what you can get when you mix genres: is it a love story during war or is it a war story that shows love is still possible? Either way, it's a dull, dull, dull story. The characters are dull, and the acting is dull.Which is all quite surprising from the late director of The English Patient (1996), a much superior film and story, in my opinion. Just proves, however, that you need a good story before you can make a good movie, especially when set during wartime.Cold Mountain, however, reminded me of the tedium of another war movie, Battle Cry (1955). And for a more credible love story set in war, see From Here To Eternity (1953)So, don't bother to see the rest of Cold Mountain after that first battle, unless you like long flashbacks, long interludes and voice-overs that serve merely to send you to sleep.In fact, I don't even recommend seeing it, even the first big battle. It's just not worth your time.",3.0,Anonymous,History
"Not nearly ""Minghella"" enough for me","Never before have I been so bewildered by a movie before, a movie that is by equal terms laughably bad and awe-inspiring. The opening battle scene is one of the best I have ever seen filmed (although the question of how Inman's Indian friend survived the knife fight with the black Union soldier when it clearly shows he was about to get the sharp end of it), and the reflection of fighting soldiers in the bloody mud puddle with a blood-drenched Union flag on the ground was a nice touch.The problem I had with the film (notice I did not say, ""the problem with the film"" props to me!) is that, crowd-pleasing moments and Minghella-type storytelling do not mesh. Rumours abound that Boss Weinstein had too large a hand in this production in his zeal for the annual Oscar campaign. The deft artistic risk-taking and touches that Minghella lovingly placed on ""The English Patient"" and ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" are few and far between in ""Cold Mountain"".Ms. Natalie Portman is of particular notice, she gives an excellent supporting performance in her all-too brief screen time, and the sexual tension between her and Mr. Law clearly overshadows the tension that Inman and Ada were supposed to have. It just goes to show that some things cannot be faked.I must point out Robert Altman's excellent film ""McCabe + Mrs. Miller"" on how to properly film a period movie, much less a Western. In that film, you can literally feel the dirt and grime oozing out of everything. The actors have real dirt on their face, clothes, and under their nails, not movie makeup. I only mention this because its the inappropriate use of makeup in this film that distracted me from fully immersing myself in the story. For example, when Ada meets Inman for the first time, instead of concentrating on how they are reacting to each other, I was totally mesmerized by the detail and complexity of Nicole Kidman's eye makeup.This is a good movie, but not a great one. Somehow, I expected better from Minghella. I think he has paid his dues by now, so perhaps on his next Miramax film he will be able to tell Boss Weinstein what exactly he can do with himself.",,Anonymous,History

This film could have been a classic and for instance Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood would have made it so....don't say they are too old which would be Ageism.

Depressing tale in frozen scenario,"Much has been said about the implausibility of the romance between the Jude Law and the Nicole Kidman characters, but personally I do not find their idealistic passion unbelievable. Actually, the fact that they barely know each other adds to the credibility of their long-term, long-distance relationship. Love at first sight does occur, and mad passion usually burns in the early stages of a relationship, when one does not know the other well. Then you have mystery fueled by desire, hope and expectations.Therefore I do not object to Inman and Ada passion. What I object to, is the fact that Ada is quite too old to be taken seriously as a passionate virgin. When Kidman played this part she was 36, which is more the age for a mature spinster. Besides, Jude Law is five years younger than Kidman and it does show. Basically, I wonder why the part of Ada did not go to a younger actress. Kidman looks fantastic for her age and she is a beautiful woman, but this part called for a girl. Portman, who has a supporting role, would have been perfect for the lead.Another thing I object to is the artificiality of the whole set-up. This movie is corny sentimental while trying to sell itself as a great tragedy. Each situation is blatantly staged for maximum cheap thrills; from the opening battle, carefully shot so as to generate horror and disgust and to convey the idea that war is unreasonable, to the sadistic torturing and killing of Ada's neighbor family, to the obligatory sex scene between the two leads, artfully shot, so as to show parts of their tonic bodies floating in honey-colored light.Minghella is pressing hard to make us reach for the handkerchiefs, but his Ada is no Scarlet O'Hara, and the final result is gloomy and depressing rather than heartbreaking. The movie sits stills in its frozen scenario, the only warmth coming from Renee Zelwegger, who deservedly got an Oscar for her performance.",4.0,Anonymous,History

I'm glad I did now, because, I would definitely have hated Cold Mountain if I'd gone in expecting the film of the year. It would be a real shame if anyone does end up with unjust feelings of vehemence toward Cold Mountain though, because it's not a film that warrants such feelings as there are a lot of area's in which it excels.

To call it a war or romance movie - doesn't do it justice. It's a movie about humanity or more often the lack of it. It's about survival and redemption. The way all the smaller stories wind around the larger is brilliant. Some may think it's depressing and maybe they're right, but I think Cold Mountain presents life, and it's trial and tribulations.

"Renee Zellweger ""stole the show""?","I just saw this film over the weekend. It is quite good! There is some amazing imagery here, and the opening battle scene was very well done. Very gritty and muddy. To bad there weren't more battle scenes, but this is not that kind of film.What we have is a loose re-telling of ""The Odyssey"" set in the Civil War. The long journey to returned to a loved one and overcoming the obstacles to get there are right out of The Odyssey. Even the sirens are in this story. This is a classic formula for good storytelling. The protagonist (played by Jude Law) has a literal journey in this film, but he failed in having his inner journey. The character is rather flat and doesn't change much. It is implied that he is changed, but I just felt Jude Law didn't portray that change well.Here's where I will demonstrate unpopular opinion...Renee Zellweger. Everyone raves about her performance and how she ""stole the show"", how great she is, her best performance, bla, bla, bla. I completely disagree. Sure, she stole the show, but it was with a completely campy, over-the-top, almost cartoon performance. The characters in this film were so believable, except for the character of Ruby. They might as well have had Ruby played by Daffy Duck; it would have had the same effect. This movie is steeped in realism, but Renee takes the audience out of that realism and puts them into another movie. The character was a nice contrast to all of the low-key characters, and was necessary for some comic relief, but a better actor should have been used. Phillip Seymour Hoffman's performance is a better example of doing a colorful and comedic performance without being out of place. Rene Zellweger was acting in a completely different movie than everyone else. You think that the director would have noticed and had her tone her performance down a bit. That being said, the rest of the supporting cast is outstanding (unfortunately, the leads are rather flat). Phillip Seymour Hoffman, as I mentioned before, and Natalie Portman are the ones who ""stole the show"" and Renee Zellweger should be happy she was not in any scenes with either of those actors because they are a completely different caliber of actors than she, and it would be very apparent that she doesn't know what screen acting is. Her style would be better suited for stage performances, because that kind of acting is necessary for that environment.Gee, I guess I don't much like Renee Zellwegger. I never realized that until now.All in all, I still think Cold Mountain was an excellent film with some amazing cinematography. The visuals alone are enough to see this film.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Film Most Likely To Sweep The Oscars,"Many 'Lord of the Rings' fans seem to be blinded in their votes for most likely film to win the Oscar for Best Picture. 'The Lord of the Rings' series has not won before and it is not likely that it will win this time because of it's content and predecessors. The Academy have never given Best Picture to Fantasy picture and they have never given it to a sequal unless the first installment won (Godfather part II should've been Chinatown) and it doesn't look like they'll do it this time.'Cold Mountain' is a sweeping romantic epic and a five star visual acheivement with stand-out performances and stunning music. Even though it is not as critically loved as LOTR it is exactly the period romantic tales that the Academy love and how can this Film be snubbed when it has the Oscar giant Miramax throughing 100% of it's support behind it this year (They won last year when they had three film's to support: 'Chicago'(won)'Gangs of New York' and 'The Hours'. It also has a previous Oscar winner at the helm, Anthony Minghella.Now to the picture itself: 'Cold Mountain'is a beautifully constructed re-entry into the great romantic epics of old (my personal favourites of which are: 'Gone with the Wind','Doctor Zhivago')The lead performances from Nicole Kidman and Jude Law are impeccable, but admittidely the supporting players slightly steal the show especially Renee Zellweger (my Best Sup. Actress pick) and Natalie Portman (I don't think she got enough rcognition for this role). The Technical sides of this film are also amazing: John Seale's cinematography, Dante Ferreti's art/set direction (should've won last year for 'Gangs'),Ann Roth's costume design, Walter Mursch's editing and most of all Gabriel Yared's amazing score (I'm listening to the soundtrack now)Many people on this site have complained about the violence and sexuality, but that's what films need these days, realism (that's what it was like back then, times were tough)Now for all the offended LOTR fans out there I do like the LOTR series (I thought Fellowship of the Ring would win over a beautiful mind anyday, But to all you blinded fan's out there just think was ROTR really going to be able to compete with Oscar's fav. genre, Romantic Epics ???And I just think that Cold Mountain is a bigger individual acheivement while ROTR is just really a continuation (would it be so successful critically if it was the only LOTR movie released? (I think Peter Jackson should get an honorary oscar for the overall acheivement of the series rather than just a fragment of it (all be it a very impressive fragment). When you think about it the more likely choice for best picture out of the LOTR series would be FOTR because it could at least stand as a movie with a beginning and an endIn conclusion: Cold Mountain 9/10 The Return of the King 9/10Thankyou and may the best movie win.............'Cold Mountain'",10.0,Anonymous,History

Cold Mountain,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, the film delivers a story that is profoundly powerful and heartbreaking. It shows us the needlessness of The Civil War and how it destroyed innocence and purity. The film shows us the drive and power of love and how it can overcome the greatest of odds. The ending is powerful and touching in so many ways.The acting is amazing. Jude Law delivers a stunning performance as a man who overcomes the greatest of odds. Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger also perform very well. Brendan Gleeson, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Giovanni Ribisi, Donald Sutherland, Ray Winstone, Kathy Baker, James Gammon, Charlie Hunnam, Jack White, and Cillian Murphy all add so much to the story and the devastation of the Civil War. Natalie Portman's performance really hit home for me. She plays a woman who has lost everything and just wants hope. She is broken and torn. Her performance was stunning.The pacing is a little slow, but I was completely engaged throughout the entire movie. The runtime is a little overlong.Pros: Powerful and heartbreaking story, touching ending, amazing acting, Jude Law's performance, Natalie Portman and her powerful acting, and a great message about loss, love, and warCons: Some slow pacing and an overlong runtimeOverall Rating: 8.4",8.0,Anonymous,History

The epic historical/love story, the score, the cinematography, the broad and unique cast of characters, and wonderful performances all-around made for a very impactful film experience for me. It's not that I didn't like Nicole Kidman, it's just that prior to her work here I always thought of her as overpraised. That all changed with her performance here. It wasn't only the delivery of her lines but she also brought an intense, genuine, and robust physicality to the character that blazed with power and intensity. Jude Law and Renee Zellweger played opposite characters, one barely spoke at all (Law) and the other wouldn't stop talking (Zellweger), but both were just right here. The score, which was a combination of newly written music along with traditional American folk music and was very emotive and greatly enhanced the story.

A Civil War soap opera that has held up well,"It's a Civil War romance set in 1861 and July-December 1864 in Cold Mountain, North Carolina, Petersburg, Virginia, and the route in between. There is also a postscript set in the early 1870s.The widowed Rev. Monroe (Donald Sutherland) moves from Charlestown, South Carolina, to Cold Mountain, North Carolina, in early spring 1861 with his daughter, Ada (Nicole Kidman). Ada is city-cultured and educated but ill-prepared for the hard-scrapple life in the Blue Ridge Mountains. However, she catches the eye of a shy carpenter, William Inman (Jude Law). They only begin a romance before he heads off for war.The movie begins in 1864 at the Battle of the Crater in Virginia, where Inman is seriously injured but survives. The film then alternates between Ada's experiences back in Cold Mountain and Inman's efforts to return the 400 miles to Cold Mountain from Petersburg as a deserter. Both Inman and Ada encounter quirky characters who help them survive highly challenging experiences. For Inman, these include Rev. Veasey (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a hermit (Eileen Atkins), and a young widow, Sara (Natalie Portman). For Ada, they include farmers Esco (James Gammon) and Sally Swanger (Kathy Baker), mountain-smart Ruby Thewes (Renée Zellweger) and her father, Stobrod (Brendan Gleeson), and Homeguard nemesis, Mr. Teague (Ray Winstone).""Cold Mountain"" is a very well-done Civil War soap opera.

There is barely any attention paid to the slavery and atrocities that made the South so hell-like for those unfortunate to be born and sold into slavery. Inman is never shown to be remorseful except once (""I don't want to fight for a cause I don't believe in"") but there is nothing more shown for that. He is portrayed as a pretty vapid, shallow mystery man of few words and even fewer perceptive thoughts. This works, and it makes his heroism all the better because of its stark contrast to his otherwise nondescript character. Renee Zellweger does a fine job as Ruby, and really is the heart and soul of this film. Nicole Kidman is excellent as always, although almost too otherworldly as a presence to be perceived as a riches-to-rags girl from the city. It makes her a joy to watch, though. Charlie Hunnam really steals the show with the few scenes he's in as a reinvention of Birch, this time around named Bosie, an albino with a hobby of inflicting serious pain on unlucky victims. Ray Winstone is effective as Teague, although he always plays sleazy, sneaky villains so this is no exception. The battle scenes and violent moments in the film are the most effective parts of the film. They really draw you in, and although are nowhere near as graphic or realistically gory as Saving Private Ryan (indeed, I would have appreciated more gore for realism's sake, people get gunned down and they have no wounds or blood sometimes) the drama is truly jarring as we see humanity at its very worst (boys and men being killed in the blink of an eye, stepped on, and crushed). The torture of Sally Swanger (Kathy Baker) is also an effective look at the brutality of the home guard, these scenes really work because the violence - although lacking in realism at times - is still well played in terms of shaking you up and reminding you times are grim. All in all, the emotional scenes are beautiful (if not a little hammy), the supernatural elements effective, the battle scenes excellent, the photography beautiful, and the performances more or less right on target. It's one of those trendy ""epic violent movies"" of 2003, which seemed like a real hot year for violent, fast-paced epic movies. Check it out, but don't expect a masterpiece of modern cinema. But it definitely hits the mark in a way that few filmmakers can do.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Best production ever.,"The well twisted storyline and best production is based on the civil war in North Carolina. Superb cinematography and great visual effects. I felt the coldness in my bones and enthralled by the beauty and cried in the tragic scenes. The film got many awards.The beginning of this century had been very difficult for
people around the world. But also for Nicole Kidman, the stars
were against her. That is, in her sign Gemini the evil of
Saturn was there which destroyed her emotional and personal life. They say that
Saturn is a great teacher planet that takes the test first
and gives lessons later. Nicole also learned life's lessons,
which involved suffering, hard work and constant
struggle. She has transferred this coldness around her successfully in this film.Not only did she start singing herself, but she dedicated her life to acting. Then she got the fruits of her hard work and patience, which was in the form of nomination for the Best actress Oscar Award. After this film she never looked back and the sky is not the limit for her.The multitalented super star Rene Zelvegere got the Best Co actress Oscar award alongwith many other awards for this film which proved to be a jump start for her acting career and incredible fame.The most handsome Jude Law also proved his metal in this multifaceted action thriller.The actor cum violinist played himself in this film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Hollywood's Civil War Executed with Commanding Skill,"Oscar nominations for ""Cold Mountain"" are assured. It's a sweeping micro-epic of the Civil War and it succeeds where other recent sprawling films about the great internecine conflict, ""Gods and Generals"" for example, fail. And the reason why it holds viewers' attention through two and a half hours is that it focuses on relationships - good, bad and homicidal - rather than on the great battles and still controversial generals from that conflict. Unlike ""Gettysburg"" and ""Gods and Generals"" we can all sit back in comfort and not debate or challenge whether Lee knew his business, a subject that prompts vigorous personal exchanges both North and South to this date.Based on Charles Frazier's outstanding novel of the same name ""Cold Mountain"" tracks Inman, Jude Law, a young, taciturn laborer falling in love with Ada, Nicole Kidman, as all in the small hilly North Carolina town await the act of secession that will lead to war.Australian-actress-of-any-accent-needed Kidman is marvelous as Ada who falls in love with Inman (no first name) before he joins his friends to march off to a jolly war guaranteed to be over in a short time. Inman, of course, has fallen for the preacher's blond and beautiful daughter. They exchange tintypes (an early form of photography). Donald Sutherland is the clergyman and he delivers an expectedly competent and familiar performance.Inman does not have, as the English might say, ""a good war."" He is present - up front and personal - when the Army of the Potomac launches one of the great disasters of its march on Richmond, the mining of Confederate lines before Petersburg. A curiosity: the slaughter of Union troops trapped in the Crater following the explosion is quite accurately depicted. But the troops sent in were largely black and inexperienced and here they're all white. Why so obvious a distortion of a horrific event? (Incidentally, the white brigadier general who commanded the black troops was hiding in his quarters behind the lines dead drunk while his men perished. Since the whole misbegotten, failed operation was an enormous embarrassment to generals Grant and Meade and the main Union casualties were just blacks, the drunk was quietly dismissed rather than being shot.)Inman survives a grievous wound and, barely recovered, he decides to check out of the Army of Northern Virginia and hike home. To Ada, of course.On his journey he has many adventures most of which could have been fatal. He meets and makes and loses friends. He meets and eludes or dispatches foes. Jude Law is a man with a grim determination that impresses and engrosses. His pain becomes the audience's. That's a compliment about how well he wears his role.Meanwhile, back at the farm, literally, Ada has taken in as a partner, not a servant, Ruby, played with insouciance bordering on the hopelessly comedic, by Renee Zellweger. There must be a reason why a large part of the audience broke out laughing when Ruby makes her first appearance in an unfolding set of scenes that has humor but also pathos.All is not well in the environs of Cold Mountain where law and order seems to have been exclusively delegated to a small crew of Home Guard vigilantes whose cruelty and mindless killing polarizes the characters. There were vigilantes hunting Union sympathizers and Confederate deserters, especially at the tail end of the war, but this crew is off the charts. I don't think anyone in the theater liked them. I hope not. The actors are excellent in an expectedly stereotyped portrayal. Forget Manhattan, they won't be cheered in the Deep South. I think.A short but intensely emotional performance is Natalie Portman's as the Confederate widow, Sara, alone in her forest cabin with her little baby when first Inman and then a trio of Union soldiers arrive. Portman is believable and moving. She is Everywoman who is victimized by conflicts men fight and women and children pay for with if not their lives, their welfare.Curiously, except perhaps for Florida which fell to Union forces early in the conflict, North Carolina saw little actual combat (the one significant battle in that state, Bentonville, was near the end of the war). The privations that occupy much of the screen time were common as the war drew to its disastrous close for the rebels but in North Carolina things were largely better than elsewhere.Director and screenplay writer Anthony Minghella crafted a surprisingly taut drama given its length and the complexity of interactions by numerous characters. The cinematography is excellent-the movie was shot in Romania which, it's been reported, looks more like North Carolina in 1864 than any part of that state does today. I'm not sure if that's good for Romanians.General Sherman said that ""War is hell and you can not refine it."" Hollywood has grappled with the dilemma of capturing America's war that is still being fought over 140 years later. D.W. Griffith was the first prominent director to deal with the war and its issues and the celluloid avalanche hasn't stopped. ""Cold Mountain"" will achieve success throughout the country because it has truly terrible characters on both sides, avoids any real discussion of root issues such as slavery and shows kindness to slaves (Ada's willingness to go out in the rain to deliver cider to the slave quarters during a big party is almost enough to make one wonder what the fuss was all about). The war in ""Cold Mountain is brutal as it affects individuals and meaningless as a recounting of a conflict without comparison in our history. So general audience acceptance north and south of the Mason-Dixon Line (meaning box office receipts) is assured.But it is a very good, not a great movie, largely because of the intensity of Law's and Kidman's acting. And we'll be seeing white-knuckled cast members in the audience at Oscar time. Trust me on that.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Civil War accurately portrayed?,"This movie was filled with tiresome clichés dressed up as an historical portrait of the South.To begin with it buys into the fallacy that the Civil War was primarily about slavery when it only became about that in the history books after the Union forces won. Some glaring historical facts support this such as the fact that Lincoln did not ""free the slaves"" until at least two years into the war and then he only freed the Southern slaves. Ulysses Grant - general of the Union forces - had slaves during the war whereas General Lee did not.In the South blacks fought alongside the whites. Whereas in the North they had their own segregated regiment - ""eulogized"" in the movie ""Glory"" with Matthew Broderick - as the union men did not want to fight alongside ""darkies"".The people of New York rioted and killed blacks after Lincoln's emancipation decree - somewhat accurately portrayed in the movie ""The Gangs of New York.""All these facts fly in the face of the ""death to all abolitionists"" line in the movie Cold Mountain - when in fact there were many abolitionist organizations in the South. These facts fly in the face of the seeming ignorance people in the movie have as to the battle cry of the South when one says ""last time I checked the south was a direction"". As if someone in the South - who voted overwhelmingly for succession - would not understand that the war was about the independence of states and their rights. They fought against the tyranny of the North to force their will on other states simply because they had more guns.Like most I am glad slavery died but let us not pretend that this was nobly achieved as the central cause behind the American Civil War - or more accurately The War of Northern Aggression.",1.0,Anonymous,History

Good war film but a tad bit overlong,"This is an artistic take on the ravages of war. Cold Mountain was adapted from the long, complex novel by Charles Frazier, and clearly proved to be a challenge for Minghella to capture on film. The movie has its share of structural problems, and may be a little longer than seems necessary, but it rarely lost my attention. I would not place this in the top echelon of end-of-the-year motion pictures, but it's certainly a successful adaptation, features numerous memorable performances (mostly by the supporting players), and is worth a post-holiday expenditure of time and money. One thing that cannot be denied is the effectiveness of the film's look. This is a gorgeous film to watch, with deserved credit given to cinematographer John Seale.",,Anonymous,History

In hopes of a better world,"Aside from the fact that most people apparently are not cerebral enough, nor paying attention to details, the comments I have seen lack imagination in the extreme. When I see a movie I suspend disbelief and become absorbed with the plot and characters. I am, however, more disappointed to discover that there are a large number of people whose attention span does not go beyond 90 minutes.As to the film, I have seen it about 12 times which gave me the opportunity to watch the details and still I am compelled by this film. I have also read the book, which indeed does not match the film. However, the details that are added to the characters are worth the time to read it.I have to agree that Nichole's acting is shallow and that the development of her character seems lacking. As you watch Inman from the beginning to the end you see a remarkable change in his carriage, looks and demeanor that is stunning to watch. He ages in accordance with what he experiences. As you watch Ada, she does little more than change her clothing and it is obvious that makeup is performing all the acting when she should be blushing.Having seen both of these actors in other movies, I am very impressed with Jude Law and his desire to hone his craft. Nichole seems to be riding her sexuality to the end and I fear she will never go beyond that to make a real actress.I give this film a resounding 10/10 rating.",9.0,Anonymous,History

As beautiful a movie as I've ever seen,"I can't remember ever seeing such dynamically beautiful scenery. It absolutely took my breath away. Quite honestly I never cared much for Nicole Kidman before I saw her in this movie. She was absolutely stunning. This is the first movie that I ever remember seeing Renee Zellweger in. I fell head, over hills, in love with her character, Ruby. I'm from the south, and am quite familiar with southern accents, and this is one of the few movies I've seen where the accents of everyone included were done with perfection, especially Ruby. As a rule I'm not a big fan of movies involving romance, but this movie had a very poignant twist to the romance involved. It ended with such profundity, that this 59 year old mans eyes filled with tears. I can't think of enough good words to describe what an absolutely wonderful movie this was.A little bit of trivia. The revolver that Inman was using in the beginning of the movie was a pretty unique weapon. It was a Le Mat, nine shot 44, 42, or 44 caliber revolver, which also had another short 18 gauge barrel in the center of the cylinder. It was essentially confederate weapon, but by the end of the war it was, like a lot of other weapons, in the hands of both sides.If you don't see this movie you're missing a very enjoyable experience.",10.0,Anonymous,History

I hate to use these old phrases but you could feel the paper the script was written on while they spoke.It also feature several needlessly explicit sex scene's, that again were just kind of there with no real message that they seem to want to send.This is a bad movie with a plot that was doomed from the beginning that leads to several pointless adventures(To use the term loosely)followed by a long drawn out resolution with a ridiculous and predictable ending.Take my advice, save yourself two and a half hours and do something a little more productive.",2.0,Anonymous,History
"Gone With The Wind, eat your heart out!","Anthony Minghella is a genius! He loves to do these complex love stories when love is at its deepest, when passion is at its greatest, and when heartbreak is at its most touching. Ada Monroe (the great beauty Nicole Kidman) is a shy Southern belle and the daughter of the local minister in the small town of Cold Mountain, North Carolina. At the beginning of the Civil War, she meets the equally shy and deep Inman (striking performance by the handsome and great Jude Law) and they fall in love. But it's not like what we would expect: Southern belle playing hard to get or the usual Civil War soap opera. Inman and Ada are so in love its crushing and their love is expressed through their looks, the awkward moments, and the passionate first kiss they share before he marches on to the war. The film dances between the past and the present, between the war fronts and the home front. We see through historical accuracy the horrors of war and the toll it takes on humanity and of society. We see the Yankees raping and pillaging the women left behind by their Confederate husbands. And we see the harsh struggles that those on the home front must endure. While Inman lays injured he begins to see the reality of war and its illusion. He is the classic hero defined by Joseph Campbell: on a journey where he is tested by lust, vengeance, and faith. He endures starvation, pain, and harsh weather. He is a deserter and a target for death by treason. But his only hope and his only reason is love. Love in all its purity and in all of its crushing power to be with the woman he loves: Ada. Meanwhile, Ada herself waits for Inman and waits with agony and worry that he may never return to her or may never have loved her. She struggles with poverty, the possibility of losing her home to thieving opportunists like Col. Teague (great performance by Ray Winstone), and borderline poverty. And then Ruby Thewes, (Oscar-winning performance by Renee Zellwegger) a tough, no-nonsense, and strong young woman who befriends Ada and together the two women learn from each other. Ruby teaches Ada how to farm and keep busy while Ada teaches Ruby about culture and love. Together they are like sisters fighting off the crows and the weather. Anthony Minghella uses the formula used in another complex love story called ""The English Patient."" He is not a filmmaker who will go for the girl meets boy and they live happily ever after soap opera or teen slick. He is fascinated by love stories where words are said at the last moment and when love is at its greatest in times of war. There are so many moments in the film, but my favorites: Inman and the old woman (Eileen Atkins) who nurses him back to health and sends him his journey. Inman and the young Confederate widow (a brief, but touching performance by Natalie Portman). He needs shelter and she is alone with her baby. The scene where she asks him to sleep next to her is so poignant and touching. She is lonely and in mourning of her lost love; He is in search of the woman he left behind. It was scene not to be in any sexual matter, but it was scene of comfort and of true humanity at its finest. But like any other war movie there are also moments of horror: ""Patrols"" on the home fronts torturing and killing their own people in search of deserters. Union soldiers terrorizing widows and families of the Confederate army (Natalie Portman has an agonizing scene when three Union soldiers force her to watch her sick baby being exposed to the cold in order for them to get food and to eventually rape her) ""Cold Mountain"" is a beautiful film because it shows both the beautiful and the ugly sides of the human race. The film is also a show of love at its greatest.",,Anonymous,History
"Worthy, full of qualities, it is a film of great merits, despite some weaknesses.","The American Civil War is one of those historic moments that gave rise to a lot of movies, as it was one of the great defining moments of America's historical course. This film was directed by Anthony Minghella, who left us films as good as ""The English Patient"" and ""Talented Mr. Ripley"", with which this film makes a trio, a ""best-off"" of the director. The film, by the way, was one of the great cinematographic releases of 2003 and a serious competitor at the 2004 Oscars, with seven nominations of which it managed to reach only one.Despite being a film set in the civil war, it has few war scenes, preferring to give the audience yet another wartime romance, in ""Pearl Harbor"" style: he goes to fight, and she suffers in the rear, yearning for the return of her beloved. The film is happy in the way it gives an overview of the political position of North Carolina, which joined late to the Confederacy and, despite the youthful enthusiasm of some and the personal interests of others, the southern cause was not so unanimous. Much less well drawn is the romance that forms the core of the script: after all, love at first sight is something difficult to take seriously, and it is the protagonists themselves who assume that they didn't turn around and spoke long before the mobilization, despite the passion that unites them. This gives their romance a touch of incredibility.Despite this weakness, we have two great actors committed to the maximum effort in this story: I have to particularly highlight the effort of Nicole Kidman, who gives us one of the most powerful works of her career (better than in ""Moulin Rouge"" and without the distance and the coolness her character demanded in ""The Hours""). Insecure but courageous, hopeful in a love that had everything to go wrong, her character demanded a lot from the actress, and she was able to rise to the challenge. In the background, Jude Law is just as happy here, giving life to a farmworker who is recruited to fight in a cause he feels belongs to others and not his, until he is wounded and takes the opportunity to desert and return home. However, the character doesn't have as much subtlety and depth as it could. Much richer and more interesting is the figure played by Renée Zellweger who, like Kidman, had just been successful as the protagonist of a musical (""Chicago"", while Kidman had made ""Moulin Rouge""). Her character in this film is a hardworking, empowered, self-assured woman who doesn't expect anything to be done for her... in a way, it reminded me a lot of Sofia, the character played by Oprah Winfrey in ""Color Purple"", many years ago. The award for her work was the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, after two years in which she was nominated and saw it slip away. The cast is completed by honorable and talented additions, including Philip Seymour Hoffman, Brendan Gleeson, Donald Sutherland and Ray Winstone. On the negative side, I want to highlight the participation of Natalie Portman and Giovanni Ribisi... not because of the actors' demerits, but mainly because of the way in which the film didn't know how to use them as much as it could, because of the little relevance of their characters to the plot.Technically, the film has a lot of qualities, starting with its impeccable cinematography, in which the skillful use of the camera allows us to have a lot of clarity, light and a beautiful color palette, giving intimacy to the most romantic or introspective scenes while still giving grandeur to the war scenes and dynamism to the action scenes. The addition of excellent visual and sound effects, often using CGI and other digital tools, was a bonus to the entire cinematic show. The sets and costumes are perfectly suited to the time and period portrayed, with no glaring anachronisms that would make a historian pull out his hair. The film is relatively long, two and a half hours long, but it was well edited, and I only felt it drag on in some very concrete scenes. The dialogues were well done, but it's the monologues that give it more drama thanks to the characters' letters, which are a little too melodramatic. The soundtrack does a satisfying job, but it also doesn't have any themes that particularly stand out.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Well made...but awful.,"Considering how important the US Civil War was and how many died in this awful war, it's surprising how few films have been made about it. By comparison, there have probably been ten times as many American movies about WWII...or more. So, I was happy to see a film about the war...particularly on a personal level where you can see how the war affected ordinary folks like you see in ""Cold Mountain"". This film is particularly unusual in that it's told from the Southern perspective...something you only saw in Hollywood films of the 1930s-40s...as well as in the infamous ""Birth of a Nation"".The story is NOT a story about glory or victory. Instead, it's about the awfulness of war...starvation, desertion and depravity. In other words, it's a tough movie to watch and is NOT a film I'd let most kids watch. Additionally, it has some nudity...not exactly sexy nudity, but nudity.The story is told much like two separate stories...that of Ada (Nicole Kidman) and her lover Inman (Jude Law). And, it also is ion many ways like ""The Odyssey""...featuring a lot and dangerous journey.When the war begins, Inman, like too many met, thought it was going to be quick and easy. Instead, it's long, bloody and terrible...and eventually, after being wounded, Inman has had enough and decides to sneak back home...just like other men in the story. As for Ada, she's pretty worthless on her own and has no idea how to run the farm or take care of herself. Only with the help of Ruby (Renée Zellweger) does she manage to survive. Will the pair ever be reunited or will one of many gangs of folks who track down and kills deserters get to him first?This is an exquisite film...with one problem. It is so depressing and the end so tough to watch, you might not want to see it. I thought it was a great film...and I give it a 10.

Gritty,"A lengthy movie, with a stellar cast and memorable roles. An improbable love story between Ada and Inman. Improbable since they hardly spoke more than a few words before he was sent off to war. Ada and her father, a Reverend, came from the 'big' city to Cold Mountain. There are some brutal battle scenes, the main one around the 'pit' that was from an attempt to breach the Confederate lines, but was horribly mismanaged by the Union side leading to a slaughter. The story spans more than three years, and although badly wounded, Inman seeks to return to Ada, and Ada keeps her love for him. But Inman is wounded, and hence if he tries that he will be labeled a deserter, since all able bodied men are needed for the fighting. And there is a group of what can only be described as power hungry vigilantes, searching for Confederate deserters, and ready and willing to terrorize anyone in doing so. They call themselves the 'Home Guard.' The movie really captures the hardships brought about by the war. Ada's father dies, she has no real skills for farming, and the entire area is in sad economic suffering. But along comes Ruby, who knows what to do, and makes a huge difference. It is not all grim, however, as there are some moments of levity. For instance: Q. You shot or something? A. Not lately. Later in the film, we find that Ada wrote 103 letter to Inman, and he received only 3. She received none from him. So it is reasonable to question if such a love between two who are really strangers is possible.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Disapointing,"If folks are going to see a Civil War movie, they'll be very disapointed. Most the movie is of Law trying to get home and the girls working the farm. The battle scenes you see in the trailers is almost all you see in the film. Even most of the folks I know who have seen it were very disapointed and one even walked out. Word is, don't waste your money and wait for the video to come out and rent it. I was hoping for a good Civil War film like everybody else and this was just awful.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Loved the movie ~ HATE the book,"I just watched to movie for the first time a few weeks ago. Loved it! Have watched it 3 times. Usually do not like war movies, but this one has a breathe-taking love story that goes along with it. Could watch it over and over. Love Ruby and the look in Inman's eyes when he looks at Ada. Since the movie was based on a book, I thought, the books are always better, I am going to read it. Got the book and HATED it. There is so much that is different in the book - all things that just mess up the story! How they meet is different, the town and people are different. Throughout the book Inman and Ada hardly ever say anything about each other. They are suppose to be long lost loves returning to each other/waiting, longing for each other. In the book Inman is just returning to his home. Ada is always talking and being reminded about her dead dad - not about Inman! Ada only writes to Inman 3 times in the book, and there is no breath-taking kiss before he leaves for warIf you are thinking about reading this book - skip it - watch the movie again! :)",,Anonymous,History

"War-Unleashed Sadism, and a Brilliant Jude Law","""Cold Mountain""'s leads are two of the most beautiful stars of all time: Nicole Kidman and Jude Law. In addition to being peacocks, their love lives are tabloid staples.It is set in the South during the Civil War, a time we inevitably associate with one of the epic romances of all time, ""Gone with the Wind."" Given the leads and the setting, not to mention the movie posters and the cover of the DVD box, you may come to this movie expecting an epic romance.What I'll remember from this movie, though, are the literally gut-churning scenes of war-unleashed sadism, carnage, and torture.I love Kathy Baker; she is an angelic presence in this film. And she is tortured on camera. It's a brief scene, but I wish I had never seen it.There's one scene of war atrocity after another: a beautiful and defenseless young mother menaced by Yankee soldiers who mean to rape her, steal her food, and murder her baby; a vicious albino (Albinos get such a bad rap; Hollywood should be ashamed) dancing on a board crushing a woman's neck, while her loved ones are shot in front of her eyes; soldiers blowing up other soldiers and then being trapped in the crater they created; a man attempting to murder the slave he impregnated.I'm willing to watch disturbing material if it comes together to educate me, move me, make me a better person...that didn't happen here. I was just cringing, holding my gut, waiting for the next unbearable scene.That's because ""Cold Mountain"" is episodic. Characters appear, speak high falutin', literary sounding monologues, and then disappear, often after being killed in some horribly diabolical way.These various characters' stories don't intertwine, or lead up to a climax where they all come together.You have to admire the very high production values of ""Cold Mountain."" It is beautiful to look at, but not in any new way. It's probably hard not to photograph snow covered mountains beautifully. I won't see snow covered mountains in a new way after watching ""Cold Mountain."" The cast is out of this world, and, in a way, that, combined with the film's episodicity and its off putting scenes of torture, took away from the film's impact, for me. Oh, look, there's Philip Seymour Hoffman! Oh, look, there's Natalie Portman! I half expected Charles Lane to make an appearance.I hope I can forget the torture scenes, and remember Jude Law's magnificent performance. He is just so, so good here: he is as believable as a taciturn, All American, homespun, working man of great integrity as Gary Cooper was as ""Sargeant York."" Law's performance deserves to have had a much more coherent movie around it.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Just what the world needs: Another US war/torture porn epic,"Let's not be too harsh on the novel that inspired this abomination. The result would have been the same if it had been an adaptation of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" in the hands of those filmmakers. Just like the benighted citizens of Ancient Rome amused themselves by watching human beings dismembered for their enjoyment in the arena while the rest of the world burned in a conflagration they had started but didn't know how to stop, today's Americans love nothing more (apparently) than to collectively cuddle up to tales of squalor, gratuitous blood spilling, dehumanized killing, torture and various acts of degradation and wanton barbarity. What distinguishes this little effort from the mainstream snuff porn you can rent at your local sex shop is that the values of womanhood, motherhood and vaginahood are raised on a pedestal on an equal footing with apple pie while all men (i.e. walking phalluses) are portrayed as anti-feminist pigs. For two and a half hours, the spectator is kept in perpetual suspense as to how his/her gag reflex is going to be stimulated next. This passes for art in the United States these days. And it wins Oscars and a lot of moolah for Mr. Weinstein. And, apparently, even the US matriarchy loves it!",1.0,Anonymous,History
new meaning to the word facial,"A movie incredibly over-awarded. Sure, Zellwegger is good but I think she's had more Oscar worthy performances. Ever since the divorce, I've come to really appreciate Nicole Kidman but this is just crap. I don't like Jude Law but tried not to think about it when I watched this. The problem is that even if these two did get together, it would most likely have been more of an occasional visit type of thing. Maybe this worked in the book, but it just didn't pan out for me. If you want to see one of the stupidest courting scenes, watch Kidman play piano on the back of a moving wagon while she's intermittently watching Jude Law in the field. It's so stupid, I wonder who her publicist is. I know that everyone in America really loved this movie and thought it was the godsend of great post Civil War romance/dramas but in my opinion, America seems to have forgotten Gone With the Wind. Want to see really painful love experiences and blood, and war, and drama, and everything else really uncomfortable? Watch Vivien Leigh be Scarlet O'Hara and you will wonder why you thought Cold Mountain was so good. And the sex scene? Yeah, right. I'm sure it's a really sexy experience for someone who's never seen a naked man before. Imagine, in real life, they both had butt facials and I just couldn't get over that one real aspect of movie making. Who needs to see that anyway? I don't. Rent a porn if you need to sex in a movie. It completely took away from the ""love"" and you realize that these people have been jonesning from afar for way too long. They could have picked someone else up by now. Just forget about this sappy, crappy, junky Hollywood movie that is a terrible excuse for believability -- unless, of course, you like that kind of thing.",3.0,Anonymous,History
"Oh Jude, please...","The best thing about this movie is without a doubt Jude Law. Oh my goodness he is hot!The plot is somehow tired, full of clichés and very predictable, but I suppose it was being true to the book (having never read it, I wouldn't know). But it has some redeeming aspects, like Ruby, played fantastically well by Renee Zellweger, and Ada (Nicole Kidman) who did a very good job playing the fine lady with useless skills in a time when finesse was the least thing required.However, Jude Law definitely steals the show (at least from a woman's point of view), he's totally charming, very sexy and incredibly handsome. He seems very natural in the skin of a southern man. The love scenes are very well done and very beautiful, the chemistry between them is electric.But it's a rather long and boring movie, with many unnecessary sub plots and annoying characters, like the priest and his strange habits, (at least for a ""man of God"" anyway as he calls himself).The self appointed home-guard is also quite good, being true to their call: nasty, cruel and relentless, if not contradicting! How come the blond rock star look alike thug was not fighting in the war and apparently quite right in hunting other men just as young as himself and killing them for desertion?Anyway, if you don't have something else better to do, it's a good entertainment on a wet, cold night!",5.0,Anonymous,History

"Glacially slow, cliched, messy and uninteresting.","This movie talks about the civil war. The main downfall of the movie are the numerous pointless scenes.Do not get me wrong. In general, I enjoy slow movies - if they are well done. i.e. I loved 'The gaze of Ulysse's' and 'Das Boot', both extremely long movies that tell quite a simple story. However, the longer scenes in those movies aid characterisation and immersion. The scenes in 'Cold mountain' are one of the following types:1. The heroine's voice reciting love letters to her love. 2. Pointless scenes of havoc and violence. 3. Depiction of unbelievable cruelty by the 'villains' 4. The hero wandering around.This is all packaged with very badly thought out characterisations and motifs that follow really trite cliche's.During the course of this overlong movie, nothing is learnt of the protagonists. I felt no empathy for them, or for their quest. The letter-reciting is particularly loathsome and does not add *anything at all* to the movie. Also, no matter how many times you show the hero not letting himself to the pleasures of another woman, or how many times he looks at her picture, it does not make us feel that he loves the heroine.A lot of characters are introduced quite briefly. Given that this movie is so long, it would have been better had the characters been given some more time to develop rather than have all this letter reciting. Maybe it is better that they are not, since all of their lines are just patronising monologues.This movie has no romance, no interest and no soul.",4.0,Anonymous,History

The director wanted to make the environment that no matter what, good, bad, evil or something else, Inman will go back.

Baaaad....,"Such a bad-bad movie... I had quite high expectations before seeing it (even if the name of Anthony Minghella should have made me suspicious), but this film didn't even meet my lowest expectations. Though shot in beautiful landscapes (in Romania, I read), it is overblown, boring and didn't touch me at all. Only in a very few moments I felt that all this could have been much better - as in the sequence with the young widow (Natalie Portman) searching a moment of comfort with Inman (Jude Law). Renée Zellweger's genuinely comic performance was also one of the few good points - even though the script didn't help her much.And please: Nicole Kidman is quite a good actress, but she was definitely too old for this part - especially with her Botox-ridden features...

That, and an overt awareness that they were ACTING, placed this movie in my personal ""eh"" file. The only character that makes this movie watchable for me is Renee Zellweger. This movie should not have been made with major Hollywood stars from England and Australia. This story deserves real Southerners, and emerging stars who don't divert focus from what is otherwise a beautiful story.Read the book instead.

Thinly Disguised Chick Flick,"Despite the ads showing the Battle of the Crater, anything looking like the Civil War only appears in the first few minutes of the film. The rest of this depressing film has the feel of a western. The plot is episodic, with Inman drifting from one encounter with a colorful character (more colorful than him) to another.  None of these encounters propel the plot or change him.  Meanwhile, the perpetually glamorous Ada, looking like nothing from the 1860's, is given a lesson in how to survive by Ruby. Aside from feminist feel-good, what does this have to do with the theme of waiting for Inman? Speaking of which, there's no explanation of why the two are so intent on reestablishing a relationship based on one kiss. Is she a beacon of comfort for a brutalized war veteran?  Is he the only eligible batchelor in the back woods? The movie doesn't address motives aside from a patently ridiculous romantic obsession.  And then there's the villains. The Home Guard seems to enjoy killing every stranger they find. Why?  What's in it for them?  The movie is handsome, it seems to have a grand theme, whatever it may be, and looks like a serious, major film. Problem is, the movie isn't really about anything other than two people getting back together. The grander themes of the Civil War, such as liberty or self-determination, don't play into it. In fact, if it weren't for the occasional grossly brutal scene, it would be boring.  What was Minghella thinking?",5.0,Anonymous,History
Cold it is,"There is still some money to be earned from making scripts of the 30s, although with a little more realistic violence. I don't wanna spoil somebody's naive expectations, but you really got to have a heart of stone, if you don't laugh at the end of this movie.Zellweger is overplaying, but is anyhow absolutely a born comedienne. Law and Kidman have really been lazy and really been making much money without effort. She, at least, can do much better.The good thing here are the costumes and the whole Civil War environment.

"Slow, slow, quick, quick, SLOW","There's a certain amount of nice scenic photography in this film. The mountains in winter look good from a helicopter. There is some rather horrible gore at the beginning, during the civil war battle. The rest is like ""The Outlaw Josey Whales"" without pace and without Eastwood's charisma. Just when you think the action may pick up, we get another softly-spoken, dirge-like voice-over from Nicole Kidman. Jude Law makes little impression in the lead male role. He is monosyllabic, and comes over as too lightweight for the 'epic' tale he is obliged to carry. Overall, the action is fatally episodic and the script WAY TOO LONG.

No chemistry whatsoever...,"It is most sad that there has been such a slew of bad Civil War movies in theaters of late. That said, you have an idea of how the rest of this review shall go. Cold Mountain concentrates on one thing, how war tears families apart. This it does very well, again, and again, and again. In fact there are so many examples, one wonders how they had any time for plot. This proves to be true as Anthony Minghella spends most of his time showcasing how pitiful Kidman is, how mopey Jude Law is, and how whiny Zellweger is. All three of these characters have no chemistry with eachother, especially Law and Kidman. The entire movie subsists of them pining for eachother, yet they had little, if nothing together to begin with. Now one might say that there is a much deeper meaning in this relationship, which i do acknowledge. These poor fools are cast into a conflict which they do not wish to be a part of, and they are trying to hang on to whatever is fimiliar to them. This is where it all ends however, as Law marches on home like a mindless fool and Kidman begins to move on with her life. The story as a whole sounds like the screenplay was derived using a cookbook strategy, requiring shoot outs, explosions, and a fat naked woman to keep the interest of the audience. Minghella also threw in a sex scene towards the end of the movie in a manner which lead me to believe that he almost forgot he needed one, and threw it in. Historically, there were a few inacurracies as well. Through much of the movie, Jude Law carries with him a Le Mat pistol, an item which would cost the average soldier over a month's pay. Overall, I believe that Cold Mountain should remain what it once was, a book. Simular to Hemmingway's ""A Farewell to Arms"" the book is ripe with symbolism that High School English students would love to tear into, but as a movie the characters and events are as two dimensional as the screen on which they are projected.

My only question is: Will they refund me the $10 for two matinee tickets, $13 of refreshments, and time spent traveling to, sitting through, and racing home from this piece of garbage??? They did just enough Civil War research to learn how to spell ""war."" As an avid student of the time period, I was horribly disappointed by their parade of inaccuracy.  They present battle scenes unlike those ever witnessed during the 1860s, because their film crew had no apparent clue about Civil War battles and tactics.  It is no small wonder that they had to retreat filming overseas.  They had hoped that re-enactors would give their time and effort to this work, as they had done so for ""Gettysburg"" and ""Gods and Generals.""  Not a single living historian of the Civil War was willing to be associated with this drivel, and now, having seen it, I understand why. One is hard pressed, indeed, to find anything historically accurate, emotionally moving, or socially redeeming in this utter affront to the hundreds of thousands who died during the American Civil War.  This film wants so badly to be on par with ""Gone with the Wind.""  It would have trouble matching up intellectually with ""South Park"" or ""Freddy vs. Jason."" Don't be suckered in.

"Civil War of blood, pain, love fails to reach the heights","After 630 or so comments what remains to be said? A European view maybe? The film fails. Why? Historically, its so American. 1860 of the civil war was fought primarily between the European immigrants who fled Europe because of the continual wars, social conflicts, poverty that their generations had experienced. The film lacks this perspective. The films from the great directors on war, U.S. and European, avoid the exaggerated dense combat in such a compressed colour spectrum as that of the Cold Mountain, found however in European paintings but nowhere better than in Leonardo da Vinci's Battle of Anghiari. Paintings are not films. Cold Mountain lacks distance, space and battle rhythm that is so well done in Sam Peckinpath's masterpiece Cross of Iron in the other great war films. The love story fails to reach the heights of intense emotion as other U.S. and European war films have done. The acting is good, but no better than many other films of relatively good quality. Strong coherence of a powerful current throughout the film is lacking. Through American eyes the film has nostalgic merit but as an independent work of art in the western world it lacks emotional conviction, and so sadly fails.",5.0,Anonymous,History
