ridiculously hilarious,"Being a long time fan of the BJD books (three years and counting), I had nothing but high hopes for the movie version. I was lucky enough to get into a sneak preview last night, and I was not disappointed. The movie, like the book, has the most hilarious lines and moments, and each of the actors portrayed their characters so well you couldn't imagine anyone else in that part.  Renee Zellweger IS Bridget, there is just no arguing it. No other actress could have pulled off what Renee did in this movie. Hugh Grant makes for an excellent Daniel, who is completely two faced and has a smarmy sort of charm that makes you want him just as badly as Bridget does. Colin Firth is a superb Mark Darcy, but that was a given because the character was practically written with him in mind - as all avid BJD readers know, Mark Darcy's character is a play on the Mr. Darcy Firth portrayed in Pride and Prejudice.Some of the more hardcore fans of the book may be disappointed with all the missing jokes and scenes, but to film the entire book would have left us with a 10 hour movie. The writers did an excellent job distilling the essence of the novel, and the finished product has all the charm and wit of the original. The audience, many of whom I'm sure have never read the book (and many of whom, surprisingly, were male), laughed nonstop throughout the film, and everyone seemed to enjoy it thoroughly. As for those of us who have read it, I do believe that this is one of those rare book-to-movie jobs that was really spot-on, and everything that was noticeably changed in the process only makes the movie better.  So go see it, it's hands-down one of the best movies of 2001 so far.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Horror fan watched this chick flick and enjoyed it,"I can remember when this came out and a girl that I was dating at the time suggested I watch it. Me?? A die-hard horror geek!! Nah!! Fast forward 18 years and last night me and my girlfriend sat down together and watched it. And it was really good. Granted, I wouldn't have chosen to watch this by myself, but if you're looking for a charming, date movie then look no further.
Predictable and basic but it does have a nice plot none the less, and many times we were laughing out loud. Very well acted and produced. I would, however, like to point out that very few Brits speak posh like they do here, and that snow is quite rare in England at Xmas (unless you're on top of a mountain!)
Looking forward to seeing the sequel",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Quality!,"What made this film work? What made this film break the usual British romantic conventional route? One actress! Her name is Renee Zellwegger, seriously, if the actress was British, this film would've been -'been there, done that'. Instead, this clever casting has made Bridget Jones a wonderful little picture.Renee Zellwegger is an actress who changed to suit the screenplay, now that is ACTING! Her mannerisms, her weight, her enthusiasm and cutesy style are a wonder to behold.Colin Firth does a great job, he plays his role well, a future James Bond perhaps? Hugh Grant finally gives us something different, he was actually quite funny at times.Maguire as the director handles the proceedings extremely well, this is her debut and I think she will become quite successful with small films. The Super35 wide-screen frame is used well, bravo! The screenplay is lightweight, but written well, plenty of ad-lib and spontaneity transcend the script.As a male, sit back and have a laugh.

"Not as great as everyone claims, but still amusing","Bridget Jones's Diary is a somewhat amusing movie about an English woman who wants to change her life because she finds herself in her 30s and still single. I must say though that Renée Zellweger does a wonderful job and earns her Oscar nomination for portraying Bridget Jones. Colin Firth and Hugh Grant fit their roles well also. The script is pretty average for a film like this, I don't know why but I wasn't really struck with the writing like a lot of people were, although I did like hearing Bridget's narration throughout the movie. And there were also some pretty genuinely funny moments. Now with all that said, that still doesn't mean that this romantic comedy is the best of its kind, in my opinion it's not. There were just some scenes that I thought lagged on too long and other parts that were dull. I do think that there are better romantic comedies to choose from out there, but it is worth just one watch just to see Renée Zellweger, because she really shines, if only the rest of the movie would've kept up with her. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not a hardcore chick-flick,"Speaking as one familiar with ""Pride and Prejudice""--the book and the 1995 miniseries upon which this work is loosely based--I like this spunky little movie exceedingly well, just as it is. Do not be put off by superficial comparisons to ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Notting Hill,"" both shallow and pretentious movies memorable only for one fine eulogy and some physically beautiful protagonists. ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" is more.Bridget Jones is, as its soundtrack suggests, ""Everywoman."" Every woman who has ever fumbled for words, fallen on her face, been embarrassed by her mother, chosen her underwear carefully, picked a cad for a boyfriend--whether she's a thirty-something singleton or a sixty-something grandma--can identify with Bridget on some level. You can't help pulling for her. Cheering her on is cheering yourself on.But this chick-flick is not hardcore; it has a broad sense of humor. Male viewers have been caught in the act--smirking. There is even a fistfight to warm insensitive martial hearts. A couple of famous people make appearances here, too--one with a million-dollar price on his head--Salman Rushdie, who plays himself in a wryly irreverent little sequence.It's easy to miss the movie's charm on the first screening--some very good lines are swallowed at the ends; the gratuitous profanity, casual sex, prodigious smoking and drinking are turn-offs; the heroine is an awkward, fleshy woman with reprehensible fashion taste, and one may easily posit that she ended up with an unsuitable and unlikely mate.But I contend, after a second viewing, that this movie is a little gem. There is a wonderful economy in the editing; every scene, every action tends toward only one possible conclusion, a PERFECT conclusion. And the childhood clips in the ending credits give credence to that conclusion and provide support for it--which is that the hero and heroine are made for each other.I rate it a solid 9 (with a 10 for the BBC/1995 ""Pride and Prejudice"").* * * *  S P O I L E R S   A H E A D  * * * *At first glance, Miss Jones seems stupid and inept and the last woman in the world one would pick for the intelligent and successful Mr. Darcy. But consider this: Darcy already had ""a clever wife"" before--bliss must needs be sought elsewhere. Besides, Bridget, though somewhat gauche, is not unintelligent, as evidenced by her voiceovers and some of her sallies. But most of all this: Each has something the other needs--he is steady and reliable, she possesses liveliness and warmth. Notice the wistful look on Darcy's face as he watches Bridget and Cleaver cavorting on the river. He WANTS some nonsense and indecorum in his life--needs them; she would be his savior. Imagine Darcy's life if he had settled on the competent but priggish Natasha--both parties would have stagnated. Imagine if Bridget had surrendered to the charms of a Daniel Cleaver--fun for the nonce, but misery for the long haul.No, this ending is perfect in every way, down to the last delightful epithet uttered by an aroused Darcy. And oh yes, the kiss--very promising indeed; at once tender and ardent, it leaves one with the distinct impression that Darcy will be something more than ""helpful in the kitchen.""",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the most charming romantic comedies in a while,"Bridget Jones's Diary actually gave some laughs, and for that alone gives this film reccomendation, since so few romantic comedies now adays (outside of the classic Woody Allen flick) deliver laughs WITH corny plot twists.Renee Zellwegger is as charming as she was in Jerry Maguire and Nurse Betty (though Nurse Betty has her best work) as a British woman who has some low self esteem about herself- she drinks, smokes, and eats too much, and has trouble staying away from bad boyfriends.  In the movie, it focuses on her relationships with Colin Firfth, a honest British lawyer, and Hugh Grant who is a coniving yet charming scoundrel.Some of the movie might be a tad too over-conventional for some tastes (at times it was for me), but the film delivers enough surprises and good feelings (lame for me to say that isn't it) that it should make for a good date movie that the guy might not hate with all his being.

"Delightful, witty, and sexy  a TRIUMPH!","As a huge fan of the books, I had incredibly high expectations of the movie. In order for the movie to work for me, it had to capture Bridget's plucky-heroine character and the hilarious-poignant emotions that are in the book.  Needless to say, `Bridget Jones's Diary' the movie worked very, very, very well.  Although Helen Fielding also wrote the screenplay (w/ Richard Curtis, very skilled with romantic comedies) and keeps the laughs coming, this movie could have fallen flat on its face.  But it doesn't because one, the casting is absolutely divine and two, smartly builds on some elements the book downplays.Renee Zellweger is absolutely perfect as Bridget Jones.  She has always been one of my favorite actresses and here, she totally displays Bridget's pathetic cuteness.  Zellweger gained weight for this role, too, so she looks adorably plump.  It's very, very hard to not fall in love with her the moment you see her at her family's Christmas party or drinking alone at home or listening to sad, Celine Dion music.  (You have a heart of stone if you aren't moved to laughs or tears or pity for her.)  I can't imagine anyone else playing Bridget Jones.  Zellweger fits the role because she is very much normal and approachablewe can relate to her.As Daniel Cleaver (her caddish Cassanova lover/boss), Hugh Grant is smoldering and hilarious.  (Ok, I might be a little biased because I've been in love with him for ages and ages, but you can't deny he is a great comedic actor.)  There's no trace of his stuttering that we saw (and I loved) in `Four Weddings and a Funeral' or `Sense and Sensibility.'  Grant morphs effortlessly into a cad that we all love to hate and all love to love.  Yes, it's a paradox, but that is what Grant brings to his role.  He makes being `bad' look so sexy.  You can't take your eyes off him; he brings his own humor to his role.  It's lovely, smoldering, and incredibly sexy.Colin Firth is also a delight to watch onscreen as Mark Darcy (I think I might be in love with him, too).  He is also sexy and smoldering, but not in the same wild, fiery way as Daniel Cleaver.  Firth brings a very cute sweetness to his role.  I don't know if it is his adorable face or his hair or the way he dresses or just the fact that he is a major sex symbol, but you can't help but fall in love with him the MOMENT you see him onscreen. There is also one very beautiful moment where he tells Bridget, `I like you very muchjust the way you are.'  It's incredibly romantic and, for me, ranks right up there with Tom Cruise's `You complete me' in `Jerry Maguire.' He also has rather explosive chemistry with Renee Zellweger, which is moving and sexy all at the same time.  (And, of course, the author Helen Fielding used Colin Firth as the basis for Mark Darcy, so it all works out marvelously.)I also mentioned that the movie smartly builds on some elements that the book downplays.  Yes, there are certain parts of the movie that cannot be found in the book, but I'm still glad they put them in the movie.  Most of what they added doesn't necessarily build on plot but it does add to the characters.  I don't want to give anything away because it's rather hilarious what unfolds onscreen.  The movie is filmed in an almost Ally McBeal type of way but it remains true to the sincerity, cuteness, and pathetic naivete that Bridget Jones embodies.  There are no pretensions. It's an entirely wonderful film.   10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Star rating: 4 out of 5,"Bridget Jones's Diary is a surprisingly good movie.  Detractors who deride it for its admittedly minimalist plot miss the point - this is a film that shows life without the layers of artificiality favoured by directors (resulting in movies somehow removed from the realm of the everyday in which us mere mortals dwell).  Life is frequently aimless and trivial; and therein lies the movie's attraction.  Notwithstanding of course that this is a very funny and highly original comedy.Bridget (played with considerable aplomb by Renee Zellweger) belongs to the ranks of that modern phenomenon - the over-30, unmarried career woman. Just when it seems Bridget may be destined for terminal spinster-hood, two opposing forces enter her life - charming cad Daniel, and uptight (but very sexy) lawyer Mark.  Which of the two is her Mr. Right?  And why does everyone insist on asking that question detested by all singletons - ""How's your love life going?""  The movie's conclusion is predictable, and although any other ending would leave the audience feeling cheated, it does seem somewhat tame and ultimately unsatisfying.The film encourages the viewer both to get involved with Bridget emotionally and to laugh at her at the same time.  Perhaps the best joke is the milieu inhabited by her parents - where the mini-gherkin is the height of sophistication, and 60-year-olds throw garden parties with such alarming themes as 'tarts and vicars'.  Bridget is certainly no social butterfly, and whilst we cringe at her public embarrassments (notably her TV report involving a fireman's pole and a bottom the size of Brazil), we triumph with her when she manages to turn a bad situation to her advantage.  Maybe we can recognise a little bit of Bridget Jones in all of us.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Disappointing and contrived,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the performances of Hugh Grant and Colin Firth, and Renee Zellwegger more than held her own in the lead role.  I just thought the film a bit on the silly side, and many situations were contrived.  It could have been a comedy with some depth to it, but there were too many stock Hollywood sequences like a fight breaking out with the restaurant windows breaking and cliches like that.  The music didn't fit well, it seemed too obvious that they were trying to sell the soundtrack. (I know, what else is new?)  The Pride and Prejudice parallel is really thin, see the BBC Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth if you want to see the real thing.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
My favorite Romantic Comedy,"This film I only discovered fairly recently, and just absolutely fell in love with it. It sure seemed familiar and lo and behold then I read about the Pride and Prejudice connection and then it all made complete sense.This is such a charming, lovely homage to Pride and Prejudice. The three lead characters are just perfect. It is funny, sweet at times, sad at others, and just wonderfully sexy and v. romantic (especially the last 1/4th of it).Renee is so extraordinary as Bridget Jones, who would have ever thought she could play so believable a modern Brit woman so well. Her accent seems flawless to me. Hugh Grant is hilarious and a charming Lothario throughout. But Colin Firth is who really sold me on this film. His ability to play a guy that you start out not liking but drooling over by the end of the movie is sublime.I am a big fan of the less is more style of acting that Mr. Firth puts forth in this film...much of his performance is in his eyes and his facial expressions. While Daniel (Mr. Grant's character) chatters on and on and tries to charm with his wit and words, Mark Darcy (Mr. Firth's character) just has a strong and rather silent presence along with an integrity of character that is revealed and he wins us over (as well as Bridget).This movie has a lot going on outside of the wonderful romance as well. Contemporary events, gender inequities, social differences, work place decorum, fashion, self-image, sex, family, and friendship all come under the scrutiny of Bridget Jones and her diary.This is a very good adaptation of a beloved novel. The tone, scene selection, dialogue and characters capture the essence of what fans of the book love about it. I cannot imagine it any better cast or written.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Average all round,"Based on R1 (Canada) DVD 98 minutes.Echos of Adrian Mole with much toned down humour. Bridget (Renée Zellweger) is 31, single and keeps a diary - this is their story. Zellweger plays the part well, Grant is the predictable cad with Firth donning the role of the decent though often misunderstood chap.Aside from Bridgets solo routines the humour lacks sparkle, chemistry is absent, the story is predicable and everything is decidedly average.Watch it, miss it - doesn't matter much.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's not just charming - I insist it's charming,"With certain bad movies - ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" is a famous extreme example - you start to wonder if there's something wrong with people who don't realise that they're bad.  I'm not saying that if someone LIKES ""Plan 9"" then his or her brain probably needs to be repaired; the suspicious, unhealthy thing is not LIKING the film, but being of the opinion that it's good.  (Many people have a soft spot for it precisely BECAUSE they realise how bad it is.  In this way it differs from something like ""Timecode"", where either liking the film OR having a high opinion of it is something to be embarrassed about.)  And something similar applies to, say, ""Citizen Kane"". Disliking it makes sense; thinking it's a bad film does not.But there's another kind of film that tempts me to be even more presumptuous.  ""Dumbo"" is the best example I can think of at the moment.  I can see why one might (mistakenly) have a low opinion of ""Dumbo"": some of the footage IS mere padding, the triumph at the end is too swift, the charge has been laid (falsely, but not ludicrously) that the crows are racist caricatures ... and so forth.  But surely even the people who think ""Dumbo"" is a bad film must still manage to like it.  If they don't, THEN I'm suspicious.I feel this way, to a greater or lesser degree, about a number of light comedies, and this is one of them.  I can't honestly say that I revere or adore ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" (N.B.: I'm male), but all the same, I can't help thinking that people who take an active dislike to it have something wrong with them.  This applies not just to the film as a whole but to Bridget Jones, the central character, in particular.  What has she done to merit dislike?  She's beautiful (as beautiful as Renée Zellweger has ever been on screen), honest and kind-hearted.  The diary she keeps certainly reveals her many flaws, but none is particularly pronounced, most are purely negative and anyway, she shares them all with the rest of us - so don't pretend you're not like this, too.This is an amiable, well-written and fresh romantic comedy with, for ONCE, an attractive female protagonist.  It's far from being the greatest film ever made and there may be grounds for attacking it which I haven't touched upon (I suppose there always are), and so all in all I'll understand your not thinking as much of it as I do, but, dammit, you'd better LIKE it.",,Anonymous,Romance
Not My Cup of Tea,"A British woman (Renee Zellweger) is determined to improve herself while she looks for love in a year in which she keeps a personal diary.Whether or not this is a good film depend on who you are, I suppose. Romantic comedy is not really my cup of tea, and this one is more romantic and less comedy, so it may be even less my cup of tea than just the average romantic comedy. I like Hugh Grant and Renee Zellweger, and this was a good role for Colin Firth before he went A-list... but still, following a woman's love life is not my preferred subject matter.Why this ended up on my list of things to see is completely beyond me, but now it has been seen and cannot be unseen. Let us chalk this up to taking one for the team.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Over-Rated But Enjoyable,"After all the hype this movie received when it was released, I was almost expecting to find a comedic masterpiece that redefined the meaning of comedy. What I found instead was a mildly amusing and quite pleasant tale of a 30-something woman (Renee Zellweger) dealing with being single and in search of the right man. The stereotype bothered me a bit; this idea that Bridget just couldn't live a satisfied life unless and until she found her man. Zellweger was good in a performance that didn't really demand all that much in terms of acting ability - the idea that her performance would even be considered for an Oscar is something that I just don't understand. I'm not saying that she was bad; simply that the role didn't ask very much of her.A strong supporting cast including Hugh Grant as Daniel and Colin Firth as Mark - Bridget's rival love interests - helped move the story along. How enjoyable this movie is depends on what you're looking for. If you believed the hype you're going to get less than you expect, but if you simply go in with an open mind you'll probably find this a decent enough movie. Overall I was a little disappointed, but would still rate this effort as a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Colin Firth is magical!  It is a pity that most Americans don't know who he is.,"Bridget Jones's Diary is full of lighthearted fun.  The cast is wonderful - especially true for Colin Firth. His performance is magical.  Being given such a thin material to work with, playing a `dreadful cold fish', he has artfully shown Mark Darcy's kindness and charm that gradually wins everyone's heart.  This would be an impossible mission for actors other than Colin Firth.  I enjoy every minute of his performance.  In my opinion, they should give this nice boy more camera times - that's the only complain I have about this movie.  Besides this complain, I have to congratulate the whole production team for successfully creating a movie of such weightless fun, and at the same time being honest and sincere to the human emotions. It is very hard to believe that this movie is Sharon Maguire's first one. I never read the book.  So, you can trust my observation to be totally independent of the book.  If you wish to have some fun and also like to dream a little bit, this is definitely the movie for you. BTW.  If you enjoy watching drama and haven't seen Colin Firth's ""Pride And Prejudice"" (BBC), do yourself a favor and rent it.

I guess that we can add Renee Zellweger to the list of Americans who can actually do a believable accent.,"I wouldn't call ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" the best movie of 2001 (and I usually have no interest in ""chick flicks""), but I do think that it was worth seeing. Renee Zellweger plays the titular character, a working Brit who has some plans to drastically change her life. I think that Colin Firth's and Hugh Grant's characters weren't totally necessary, but I guess that they were conduits of a sort. Bridget herself can gravitate between sweet and bitchy, and she does just that. Overall, Zellweger's energy makes the movie really good. I don't know whether anyone else would have done the role better, but she certainly does a good job. Definitely worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Brill!,"Speaking as a singleton of a certain age, I found this move dead on. Although set in England, the theme and feelings of single people everywhere were universal.  The plot line stayed pretty true to the book with a few exceptions but the tone stayed the same.

"459 already, why not one more to make it 460, right?","Oh, it's a ""Cinderella of 21st Century"" movie.

Right, when M may talk about the Parliament, the legal circle gossips, what things about B that he's really interested in?  I just find it hard to imagine Bridget is able to communicate with Mark and vice versa.  If they come together, divorce is not unlikely.  The UK, a class-conscious country. Daniel Cleaver, somehow, fits Bridget more, as long as he really cut down his number of affairs with other women.  Let's see how they deal with the sequel.

"Wake me when it's over, please....","One word sums up this movie: Idiotic.  British humor can be funny.  `Men Behaving Badly' and `Coupling' are very funny British shows I see occasionally on BBC America. But, for the love of God, this movie is positively not funny.  It also is complete foolishness, not funny foolishness but utter foolishness.  Sleep inducing foolishness.  Most of the characters are unlikable in almost every way.  Bridget is not very intelligent to put it lightly.  Her escapades I assume were supposed to be amusing but were more or less annoying.  Hugh Grant is by far and away my least favorite actor of all time.  If I had known he was in the movie I would most likely have skipped it altogether.  Colin Firth's character was the only character I enjoyed watching.  He at least had some kind of intelligence and depth along with a little mystery and intrigue.In short, I wrote this because I am flabbergasted at how highly this movie is rated here.  To put it in simple termsThis movie sucks big time.  So for those of you who have not seen this film and say to yourself `IMDB ranks it high so it must be good,' think again.

It had potential to be worthy of Zellweger's exceptional performance if it ignored the conventions of its sub-genre and the unnecessary, redundant twists near the end. Actually, I think it would have been much better if it had leaned towards being dramatic than farcically comedic. Regardless, it's still a delightful and endearing film. And, to be honest, I love it just as it is!(7/10)",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

I am Bridget Jones,"Bridget Jones' Diary is a romantic escape into the life of an imperfect singleton and the little events and habits in her life that we find amusing -- probably in part because we are each a little bit like Bridget and want to be accepted and loved. Who hasn't been embarrassed by their parents, unintentionally made a fool of oneself at a social gathering, wore the wrong clothing (or costume) to a party, dated the wrong person, or messed up at an interview? Bridget Jones' Diary is lovable and funny because it is believable and deals with these every-day events, though usually with a cruel or embarrassing twist at the expense of poor Bridget.Overall, Bridget Jones' Diary is an excellent example of a romantic comedy, and its popularity is gained through lovable and quirky characters that are easily sympathized with. Although the same lovable characters appear in the sequel, the humor is not nearly as imaginative and not focused around the everyday little events. Watch Bridget Jones' Diary is you're looking for a light and funny film. Don't bother with the sequel unless you're a major fan of the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Bridget Jones review: By me!,"i absolutely LOVE this movie. Its had me in tears of laughter. Bridget Jones, arguably the funniest film of 2001, I think you'll agree. This is a film for anyone over the age of 15, but honestly I think seeing as I'm not fifteen myself, everyone will most probably love it. But, I'll give you one piece of advice, DO NOT, and I repeat DO NOT watch it with your parents or grandparents because it will lead to utter embarrassment.The Storyline- It's New Year's Day, hung over and still single, Bridget Jones- a 30-something year old journalist girl from London-decides to start a great new life. And in order to do so, she decides to keep a diary. Of which she rights down everything from her calories gained to her instant messaging with Daniel Cleaver (her boss). She makes new years resolutions such as: to stop smoking; make better use of time; and learn to programme video. It is a film like no other, a masterpiece of great storytelling. As for the genre-it is a Romantic Comedy, which is very equally balanced, which on one hand, makes you feel very sorry for Bridget at times, but on the other will leave you laughing uncontrollably. I mean, come on, how many films have you seen with a great storyline, a love triangle, and that can make you laugh till your ribs hurt? Now I think of it, not many!Characters: Mark Darcy, the love of Bridget's life, and Daniel Cleaver, quite funnily enough, also, the love of Bridget's life are sworn enemies. Mark is a very upper-class sophisticated character. Who is sometimes very up himself. Daniel is the complete opposite; he is a very laid back easy-going character. Jude, Sharon and Tom-Bridget's three best friends which give her some of the worst advice you can think of. But they do try to help, Tom-The main character-Bridget is a working class girl, slightly overweight, or so she thinks. She is infatuated with Daniel before Mark comes along.Movie Soundtrack-Well, I can't say it has the best choice in music to be honest, but its okay, if you're into the whole complaining of heart-ache scene. But I suppose it goes well with the movie so I can get over that. On the other hand, there are quite a few classics in the movie such as; all by myself and without you.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Better than the sequel but that isn't difficult!,"This film is complete tripe. Make no mistake about that. But when you compare it to Bridget Jones 2 it looks a lot better. Its better than movie 2 because at least it was new, if not original, following on from all those 90s English chick-flicks. There are a host of familiar faces in the film, most of whom coast through the film clearly waiting for the cheque to arrive. Jim Broadbent is welcome in the film, but after his brilliant appearances as Slater in Only Fools and Horses its sad to see him wasting his time in this bilge. The jokes are predictable and come with so much warning that you have time to redecorate your house before they arrive. Renee bumbles along as Bridget, her English accent all well and proper, her acting sadly not. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth play themselves as usual, and many blokes who view the film will secretly be hoping that Arnie makes an appearance to blow them away with a machine gun! Alas, they limp on. The music backing the film is that kind of cheap, cheesy commercial radio pop that is supposed to be 'uplifting' but is actually dated and boring. This film will amuse those who like the genre but for those who seek a little more you will be left cold. Overall a lazy effort from Richard Curtis who is in danger of destroying his credibility. He should really get back to Blackadder, we're well overdue a fifth series.............",,Anonymous,Romance
"Enjoyable, light, not too funny nor thought-provoking","So I just re-watched ""Bridget Jones's Diary"". It's better than what I remembered, but not by much. This is perhaps because the movie moves along quite well, as any box office smash does. It's never really funny, I didn't think. I also didn't like the main character that much, though it's hard not to warm to Renée Zellweger. The running joke is that she's sloppy and keeps embarrassing herself. I didn't think it was that funny.There's a terrible fight scene between Colin Firth and Hugh Grant. Not that you'd expect Bruce Lee vs. Chuck Norris from those two, but the fight scene isn't really funny either.I still prefer stereotypical girl movies to guy movies, but I don't think this is one of the best, despite its status.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Much more than a chick flick,"It was the cast that drew me into seeing 'Bridget Jones's Diary', although there were doubts as to whether Renee Zellwegger would work, as well as being familiar with the books, finding them entertaining enough reads if not among the best personally read, and that Richard Curtis has done some other great work.'Bridget Jones's Diary' is a pretty darn good adaptation of the book, it doesn't have everything included (that would have been a tall order) but the essence and what made the book work are captured incredibly well. This said, it is a very good film on its own terms, it can be dismissed (and has done) as a chick flick and a film just for women. It is much more than both those things, being a film that tries to appeal to both sexes and having more depth than your average romantic comedy/chick flick.Maybe 'Bridget Jones's Diary' doesn't cover any new ground. Maybe it doesn't break any conventions. That didn't matter to me, because whether it does matter with any film, TV series, episode etc. is wholly dependent on how well it executes everything else, everything else is executed with very little to complain about.Some parts were a little contrived and there is a slightly draggy section around half-way, but these were minor issues really.'Bridget Jones's Diary' is attractive visually in a film that doesn't require epic sweeping cinematography or opulence, but still manages to be beautifully shot, cohesively edited and have striking locations. Personally really liked the music, with a mix of the old greats and more contemporary performers, and it fits well.A good script always helps, and it's the script that's one of the main good things here. The humour can be daft but is often hilarious and full of wit, while the romantic parts are sentimental but never mawkish or overdone and the more drama-oriented moments have an air of poignancy. Much of the film is also deliciously charming and to me relatable. Bridget manages to be more endearing here than she is in the book, to me she was easy to sympathise with and feel pity for regardless of her faults and the numerous things she does wrong, and quite a lot of us will find a lot of ourselves in her character.Even if new ground is not covered, bright and breezy pacing and remarkably deft directing from Sharon Maguire in her directing debut help make that not count against the film.Renee Zellwegger is fantastic in the title role, any initial doubts were completely subsided after seeing a performance of immense charm and that was both funny, awkward in the adorable sense and sympathetic. She does a good job with the accent too.Cast against type, Hugh Grant still brings a smarmy charm so despite being a cad (which he brings out without seeming ill at ease at all) you do see what Bridget sees in him. Colin Firth is reserved and understated but injects the right amount of dignity, charisma and charm to not make the character dull in a role that seemed like it was written with him in mind (that his character's name is a play on from his most famous role, Mr Darcy in the wonderful 1995 'Pride and Prejudice', further gives that impression).The rest of the cast are a whos who of veteran British talent, all doing reliably solid jobs, with the always good Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent coming off best.Overall, a delight and much more than a chick flick with something for everyone regardless of gender or age if given a chance. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Pure Fun, Excellent Entertainment, Albeit A Bit Rude","Bridger Jones is a clear phenomenon, nobody can deny the fact. What Helen Fielding managed to achieve with her book is enormous. Here, both in the novel and the film, we see the heroine who is far, far from perfect. She, in words of Mr. Darcy, smokes like a chimney, drinks lake a fish and dresses like her Mom. Bridge is not ideal, she is a woman on a fatter side, prone to fall a victim of all her weaknesses and her friends. The film manages to catch this. Renee Zellweger is a great choice for the main part, albeit being a Texan, she overcame the initial difficulties and here she is a real Londoner, with an unmistakable British accent, British ideas and customs. The other great winner is Colin Firth who depicted Mr. Darcy with his cool, reserved, down to earth manner. Colin is hilariously reserved and his near smiles are unforgettable. Hugh Grant is yet another perfect choice for the part of Daniel Cleever, a classic cad, sweet and deadly nice outside and terribly rotten inside. Typical cynical British humor shines and sparkles like a tinsel all the way through; unbelievably hilarious situations which Bridget finds herself in make you laugh all 90 minutes of this light, tight, bright and delightful comedy. What made me feel a bit repulsive was a continuous talk about sex, sex, sex. When the topic was repeatedly returned to even by Bridge's Mom, I was nearly shocked. Then, maybe this is a huge cultural gap, but the sheer impudence of some talks also nearly killed me. In my country, Russia, to tell a woman in her face that she is getting old and she absolutely must get a man is a unimaginable rudeness. Here, it is shown as if it is natural and no one seems to correct themselves after such a shocking case of rude behavior. Sometimes, the film gets pathetic, though, especially when it does show the way too prolonged scene of fistfight between Darcy and Cleever. After all, the film doesn't make you think too hard. Well, we all are created imperfect, we smoke, drink, and say foul words, have premarital sex, tell lies, cheat, et cetera. This has to be fought, not somehow celebrated. But it is good to be made fun of. In which, the film got very well.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"It's a classic, deal with it.","Reviewing this movie, there's no denying: this would never be released if done today.There are so many reasons this movie aged like milk: American actress playing an English character; calling a visibly normal, not even chubby character ""fat""; the use of the word ""poff"" to describe a gay man; not a single black person in London; self-loathing woman who's only goal in life is to get herself a man; glamourising sexual harassment at work. And I guess I'm missing more details.So what? Yesterday is not today. Fortunately, society has been tackling these issues and nowadays we are more aware, more thoughtful. This movie feels like a period piece on how life an mentality was back then. And that's fine. Actually, it's fascinating.Bridget Jones is a mess of a person, bad at her job, obsessed over all the wrong things, completely missing her priorities. She's everyone's hero because she is everyone. Even if you're great at life, there's a little you in your mind that often struggles with the silly things in life, and that is Bridget.Plus, she lives in central London. And has two hot guys fighting over her. If your little self has a dream, this is the one.Bridget Jones Diary is the quintessential British rom-com. Which is no wonder because it is based in the quintessential British romance (Pride and Prejudice).The movie is silly, but it's really funny, easy to watch and romantic. Great actors who make the characters believable. It's not The Godfather or Inception or whatever great movie, but it's a classic on its genre.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great Light Entertainment,"Bridget Jones's Diary is a very entertaining and very light romantic comedy that is well written, well cast and subtlety humorous from start to finish. Renee Zellweger captures the character of Bridget very well, quickly allowing the audience to empathise with her vulnerabilities and relationship issues, and thankfully Hugh Grant and Colin Firth support her excellently along with the rest of the cast.On the down side, I did find some of the scenes a little cringe worthy to endure and i did feel that there were not enough laugh out-loud moments.All in all Bridget Jones's Diary is a winner, and although better suited to a female audience; is still has enough to entertain most fans of the genre.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Absolutely bad! Stay away,"I don't get. Why do so many people like this movie? It plain bad, and that's it. It may be that the novel is better, I can't comment on that, I didn't read it. The film keeps being awful. It is called a romantic comedy but where are the jokes? It just an highly ""escapistik"" movie if you please recall the content. There is a drug addicted, not especially good looking woman in her mid-thirties as protagonist. She is clumsy and has no real abilities. But that is not stopping her in having a career as TV Journalist and two men who are both looking like models want to have her. Huh? That so makes no sense. Of course one could overlook this. But somehow I can't. In an Action movie or a fantasy film, i don't expect realism. Even in more grounded movies I can live without über-realism. But this movie claims to show the life of a woman in her mid-thirties. And this doesn't work for me in the portrayed way. I could ignore this if it were funny. But it isn't. And I will never understand how they got Salman Rushdie as participant. Sorry to the people who enjoyed it but I just wrote down my opinion.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Funny,"I adore Jane Austen. The woman could have been a Behaviorist, so far was she ahead of her time. Add to that her keen insight, sharp and witty tongue, and impeccable prose style, and we undoubtedly have one of the top 5 or so authors of the 19th century. While I agree that Bridget Jones's Diary could not possibly compete with Miss Austen, though based on themes and characters from several of her works, I have to say I found it extremely entertaining in it's own right.Renee Zellweger is a talented comic actress, and anyone who can play a difficult comedic role with such skill and finesse cannot possibly be as clumsy and inept a person as the character she is depicting, however limited she might appear to some. She made me laugh and call out to my roommate to ""Come and watch this girl; she's a scream!"", something I am not in the habit of doing on a regular basis.Hugh Grant was equally funny, and a wonderful foil for Colin Firth's character. Bridget's family was hideously but hilariously portrayed. I am normally not an admirer of the getting-older-woman-looking-for-a-husband-before-it's-too-late genre of films, but this was really less tired and superficial than some of these have turned out in the past. The whole film seemed to me to be particularly well done- I enjoyed it, and I recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I am seriously worried about how Sharon Maguire perceives women.,"'Bridget Jones's Diary' presents how 90's rom-coms typically utilized women in the film industry. Bridget is helpless not just in love but also in her life. I keep asking how dumber she can be. Making soup out of strings and having zero knowledge of any author even when she works in a publishing firm are the examples how the director goes too far to make her clueless. Okay, I will try (so hard) to understand she is not talented enough but has a good heart. However, her behavior is unprofessional and lazy as well. She is late for work so often and is not even apologetic. It looks as she complains about her career and love life without even trying her best, which makes her a whiny and unattractive protagonist. When watching rom-com, audience expects the chemistry, 'how perfect they are together as a couple' while this film keeps reminding audience that Darcy is too good for Bridget not because of differences in social position or outer appearance but because of how incapable of she is and how she never tries hard for anything. She lets things slide. Uncle Geoffrey and Daniel casually grab her bottom, but she is just OKAY with it, especially even in the workplace by her boss. In current point of view, 'Bridget Jones's Diary' is definitely problematic, a clear sexual harassments. Additionally, Bridget's sexy bunny costume is a obvious example of how the movies in 90s sexualize women unnecessarily. Sharon Maguire should be thankful to Renée Zellweger because she makes Bridget more tolerable and adorable and be ashamed how she realizes the main protagonist as a stupid girl who does not bother to be sexualized on the screen.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Endearing, Funny Movie","Dissatisfied at age 32 with the direction her life is taking, a young woman vows to make some changes, and to keep herself on track she decides to start a daily journal, hoping it will make her toe the line, in `Bridget Jones's Diary,' directed by Sharon Maguire and starring Renee Zellweger.  Bridget (Zellweger) begins with some New Year's resolutions that include no more drinking or smoking, not being paranoid about her weight, and developing poise.  And-- last, but not least-- to avoid any romantic attachments to alcoholics, workaholics, peeping Toms or perverts.  Of course she promptly falls for the one man she knows who embodies all of those characteristics: Her boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant).  In the meantime, her mother, Pam (Gemma Jones), continues to play matchmaker for her daughter.  At a holiday gathering of friends and family, Pam nudges her in the direction of an old childhood chum, Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), now a respectable attorney, and recently divorced.  Their initial meeting, however, proves to be a less than monumental event, further complicated by the fact that Cleaver was Darcy's Best Man at his wedding, and has some tales-out-of-school to tell about the subsequently ill fated marriage that puts Darcy in a rather bad light.  But Bridget could care less; she thinks Darcy is rude and a bore, and anyway, Daniel is her guy.  Work is good, her life is going well and-- as she is about to wake up and realize-- she hasn't kept a single one of her resolutions.  And, oh! she should have.First time director Maguire proves with this auspicious debut that she certainly knows her territory and how to negotiate it.  She has the touch and the eye for detail of a seasoned professional, and her sense of timing is impeccable.  She successfully avoids a major pitfall that do in many rookie directors right out of the chute, by never fishing for the cheap, forced, disdainfully pretentious or concocted laugh.  Everything in this film, especially the humor, flows freely and naturally from the circumstances of the characters and the story, which makes it all real and believable and allows it to be readily embraced by the audience.  This is a funny, often hilarious movie, but it's also very warm and at times poignant, and for handling it so sensibly, and with such sensitivity, Maguire deserves to be granted even more kudos.  It's quite simply an exceptionally well made film, presented with a style and grace that reflects that of the director herself.Of course, having a superlative leading lady was certainly not disadvantageous to Maguire's efforts, either, and Renee Zellweger has never been better than she is here as Bridget.  With her quirky good looks, personality and charisma, she is endearing, and she invades Meryl Streep territory by affecting a perfect British accent.  Whether she's lip-syncing to a Celine Dion song, doing karaoke at an office party after having a bit too much to drink, or battling with a blender, it's easy to believe that someone would like her just the way she is.  Even with her hair mussed, or in a somewhat disheveled state, she's alluring, and it all has to do with who she is deep down inside; Zellweger makes it clear that this is a woman of substance, and it's easy to like her.  There's a down-to-earth honesty and accessibility about her that makes her appealing, and she's someone to whom many in the audience are easily going to be able to relate.  For her portrayal of Betty in `Nurse Betty,' Zellweger received a Golden Globe; `Bridget' should land her smack in the middle of Oscar territory.As Bridget's smarmy boss, Daniel, Hugh Grant turns in a noteworthy performance, putting a rather tarnished sheen on his natural charm that works so well for this character.  It's a nice departure from his usual bumbling, reserved Mr. Nice Guy routine he perfected in such films as `Notting Hill,' and `Four Weddings and A Funeral.'  With this role he challenges Greg Kinnear's part in `Someone Like You' for the top spot in the Boss-You-Should-Never-Date category.  And Firth does a memorable turn as Darcy, fairly reprising his role of the same name in the PBS miniseries, `Pride and Prejudice,' from which this story is loosely derived.  Initially appearing a bit sullen, he gets the chance to develop his character as the story unfolds, and he does it quite nicely, ultimately revealing Darcy's true nature.In a supporting role, Gemma Jones gives a performance that deserves mention, doing a good job of fleshing out Bridget's mother in the brief time she is allotted.  Rounding out the supporting cast are Crispin Bonham-Carter (Greg), Jim Broadbent (Colin Jones), James Callis (Tom), Sally Phillips (Shazzer), Honor Blackman (Penny), Embeth Davidtz (Natasha), Shirley Henderson (Jude) and Celia Imrie (Una).  A warmly humorous, uplifting film, `Bridget Jones's Diary' is a delightful and satisfying experience with more than a touch of magic in it.  Not only is it an entertaining showcase for Zellweger's many talents, but heralds the arrival of a director from whom we can expect great things in the future, Sharon Maguire.  A well crafted, reality based comedy/drama that is enjoyable and refreshingly devoid of inane nonsense or gross jokes is a rare find these days, and this is one of the best to hit the screen in a long, long time.  It's a film to be heartily embraced, and one I guarantee you'll want to see more than once.  I rate this one 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A guy's opinion,"On first hearing about this film, dread filled my soul like a fart in an elevator. And as its simile counterpart, news of the event spread fast, catching up with my girlfriend like a fat sprinter in a cherry pie dash. As the lightning crashed and the thunder rolled, words that Mankind had feared since ages past found form on my girlfriend's lips: ""Hey Mark, let's go and see Bridget Jone's Diary""...Now don't get me wrong, ladies, I do like many films that are considered 'Chick Flicks', one of my all time favourites being 'Muriel's Wedding' or 'The Truth about Cats and Dogs'. The apprehension that clung to the bosom of my weariness lay more in the lack of any depth to the character/s. Bridget Jones is naive and abit thick - you'd think that any woman who was now about mid 30s could at least have a decent stab (no pun intended) at guessing if some guy (i.e. High Grant's Character) is a muppet. Although I can let that slide on the evidence so many friends have given me on how enigmatic most guys are (and how most of us are bastards, haha).Some of the jokes will most likely need explaining to quite a few guys. One example is why a chorus of laughter followed her getting drunk and singing bad love songs alone. Another example is when she's sliding down a pole, smacks her arse into the camera and generates crowds of girly laughter as if the audience had been contracted to provide tinned laughter for some slap-stick home video show.One issue however was with the tedious-neuroticism of Bridget Jones and her celebrating the latest fashions of excess with her incessant drinking and smoking. As I say I don't hate romantic comedies, it's just that this one seemed proud to have no depth and sectioning 50% of the humour to the 'Need to be explained to men' section...If your a girl you'll probably find this a stunning exploration into the amorous side of woman-kind, where a single real-sized woman stands up amidst a backlash of what male-kind throws at her. Despite all the disappointments and let-downs, her optimism has not been misplaced as prince charming finally cuts a path through the web of first-impressions, pride and prejudice (pun intentional) to sweep her off her feet... though if you read the sequel, Mark Darcy turns out not so positive.If you're a guy, it'll be mildy funny but a little tedious in places and Renee Zellweger'd get it...",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
A very charming romantic comedy with some excellent humor,"The main thing that appeals to me in ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" is the fact that it is so recognizable. Of course it isn't exactly the same as my life, but the fact of getting older, the fear of having to live the rest of your life on your own without a partner, difficulties at work... all are very recognizable. Perhaps that's why I liked this movie so much. The other reason may be that, despite the fact that she doesn't exactly look like Miss World in this movie, Renée Zellweger has something appealing and adorable. She doesn't look like a model, but as the average woman, with all her imperfections like being slightly overweight, drinking, smoking, saying whatever she thinks... and she gets away with it perfectly.I'm sure that the fact that Hugh Grant has an important role in this movie as her boss, also makes that this romantic comedy works. As we all know, this is the kind of movies he has been doing so many times before and he is really good at it. His typical British flair and humor were essential to make this movie work perfectly.I haven't read the book, but if it is as good as this movie, than I definitely should give it a try. I really liked the movie and had some great laughs (for instance with the blue soup). In fact I think I can say this is a very charming romantic comedy with some excellent humor in it that should be seen by all. I give it an 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

I loved this film when I waited anxiously outside Woolies, waiting for it to open so I could run in and be the first to buy it. And oh how I love Mark Darcy...You probably already know the story - Bridget is a food adoring, chain smoking singleton who is desparate not to die alone and be eaten by alsatians but also is determined not to fall for the wrong guy - certainly no peeping toms, meglamaniacs, commitment phobics or emotional f**kwitts. So who does she fall for? Charming Daniel Cleaver - a bed-hopping rogue who just happens to be her boss. Very naughty Bridget! With the added pressure of trying to stop smoking, start dieting and basically becoming a better person, Bridget Jones is weaving a very tangled web, that is until the beautifully mysterious Mr Darcy enters into her life.....To be honest I had my doubts about Renee Zellweger cast as much-loved Bridget - why couldn't they just pick a good old English actress, someone like Kate Winslet perhaps....? Well, thats what I thought before but after watching the film several thousand times now, I CANNOT imagine any other woman in the world playing her, Zellweger was fantastic - she managed to be hilarious, heart-warming and totally georgous all at the same time. I usually find that most American actors/actresses when portraying English characters usually opt for one of two extremes - alwful cockney accent similar to that of Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins or completely OTT, Royal family type, well spoken accent similar to that of the Queen, Zellweger managed to get hers spot on without sounding completely ridiculous.It was great to see Hugh Grant not be type-cast yet again as the mumbling, all round good guy with the giantic floppy fringe, he still had a bit of the fringe but managed to show us he can play the sexy, bad guy too.And finally, I thought I'd save the best to last, Colin Firth. He was perfect as Mark Darcy, he didn't even have to open his mouth once and he still would've made the film - I know thats probably really shallow and girly-like of me but per-lease, the man looks good in a reindeer jumper for crying out loud. I'm not really a big romantic comedy type fan, but even I was yearning to be in Bridgets shoes in the very last 'coat' scene - for those women who have already seen it, you'll know what scene I'm talking about.....To sum up, it's funny, heart-warming, very funny and more than just a stupid 'chick-flick' and if you're not going to see it for its suberb script, hilairious jokes, great acting and brilliant soundtrack. Then see it for the fireman pole scene.  10/10",,Anonymous,Romance
Bridget Jones's Diary: 6/10,"If there's anything I hate more than overrated movies, it's overhyped movies that don't even begin to live up to their reputation. Bridget Jones's Diary is one of the latter. With an original premise (which is of course taken from a book), a rising star, and charm out the wazoo, how could you go wrong? It's all in the marketing. A clever comedy has to have two things. A consistent clever quality to it and comedy. When lacking in either of these two categories, the company (usually Miramax) just overhypes it (as they're great at doing) so it'll be like the next Gone with the Wind or something and make sure that everyone knows that the lead actress packed on a couple extra pounds. And, unfortunately, that's what this movie is.The title character (Renée Zellweger) is a slightly overweight, slight neurotic thirtysomething who has a menial job and wants to make something out of her life. So she starts a diary and becomes romanticly involved with her boss. Without the diary, the movie would just be another British chick flick. The diary adds some characteristic to the movie, but, as most movies do, anything interesting they could do with the material is defenestrated for general romantic comed clichés and stereotyped characters.Why am I being so harsh on it, you may ask? Well, I had been hearing the hype for two years, since the movie first came out. ""Oh, Renée is so good, she gained 25 pounds!"" ""The movie is hilarious!"" Oftentimes I can just put away the hype and go in with an open mind. But I did not see this before hearing about it; if I had, I'm sure I would have enjoyed it more. For example, I saw My Big Fat Greek Wedding before it was huge and grossed over $200 million at the box office. I enjoyed it a lot, but if I watched it for the first time now, I'm sure I'd be thinking exactly what I am about this movie here. I was led to believe that this movie was strikingly original, nothing else had been done before that was even remotely close to it. As I have mentioned earlier, the only original part of it was the fact that the diary was getting us closer to Bridget's life. But after the first twenty minutes or so, when they knew they had us in, they took it out and went to cliché land.There were some funny moments to it, though. Nothing was down-and-out hilarious, but many points were pretty humorous, although I wouldn't be able to name them now. It's not one of those movies that sticks with you, it's just one of those that you can use to pass the time and that can be used by production companies for unnecessary sequels.Renée (who starred in here before she became America's it-girl) was pretty good and mastered a British accent masterfully, and proves that she's worthy of a future in romantic comedy. Hugh Grant, as Bridget's boss, is his usual self, and Colin Firth, as Bridget's other love interest, is alright, but that added a few plot holes, such as: if Bridget could never get a guy all of her life, how come suddenly she gets two at the same time, not to mention they look like Hugh Grant and Colin Firth? I guess I'm overreacting, but when I see something that's not what it's cracked up to me, I get upset, which is how Bridget Jones's Diary made me feel.My rating: 6/10Rated R for language and some strong sexuality.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Run of the Mill,"Often discussed as one of the early 2000s best rom-coms, Bridget Jones's Diary explores the lonely life of a woman in her early 30s. Floundering to maintain a proper relationship, Bridget Jones (Reneé Zellweger) traverses a disastrous love triangle between her egotistical boss Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant), and stoic ex-neighbor Mark Darcy (Colin Firth). While the debacle causes some quirky hijinks, the comedy throughout the film never fully grasped me. The story is fun, but the characters are slightly more interesting than your everyday co-workers. Though I never felt bored, I am unsure if this will be memorable among similar, more entertaining films. As far as rom-com's go, Bridget Jones's Diary fails to break any boundaries and is little more than a cute time filler.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A classic,"It was coming to my local cinema again, after 21 years. You know what, it still holds pretty well. Very much a modern pride and prejudice, with Bridget Jones as Elizabeth Bennett, Marc Darcy as Fitzwilliam Darcy, and Daniel Cleaver as George Wickham.

Bridget sometimes puts herself in situations uneasy to watch, but she has a good laugh about herself and takes you with her. Love it 🙂",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A bit too much cynicism passing for humor,"Saw Bridget Jones's Diary last night. Audience liked it, I must admit, but for me it was nasty and obnoxious. The fact that she's cynical is automatically inferred to mean she's funny. In the first five minutes she's put down her mother for serving pickles on toothpicks as hors d'oeuvre, a potential boyfriend for wearing a funny reindeer sweater at a Christmas party, and a gay man simply because women have some unquestionable God-given right to do so. The unintentional irony is that, for all Bridget's self-alleged independence, the picture's central, driving purpose is to attach her to a wealthy, influential man, at which point her story will end -- in marriage. Ultimately nothing better than a throwback to most of the Julie Andrews musicals (My Fair Lady, Cinderella, Sound of Music, Thoroughly Modern Millie) of ancient times -- minus the songs. The other irony is, even Julie's material has grown beyond such a shallow self-image for modern women.Snowflakes at the end looked fake in close-ups.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Have you met Miss Jones?,"While there are some elements of the film that are already dated (Christmas jumpers being uncool for example - except I hate them still!), the story is still very relevant and I think there are lots of single people or people that have struggled to find love, that can empathise with Bridget. I know at 40, that the ""Smug Marrieds"" are out there and I do feel that maybe I am some kind of Bridget replica and that I have been repelling men with some sort of toxic pheromone. The dating world isn't any easier today, even with the technology and apps available, in fact I think it might be worse, but Miss Jones gives us all hope that love is out there, even if it has lost some of its potency for me, all these years later.It's a really well put together film, if I'd been her, I would probably have ended up pursuing Daniel eternally and completely missing the fact that Mark was there at all, whilst sleeping with my boss at Sit Up Britain, because I'm just that stupid and because I've never seen the Colin Firth/Darcy fascination. I'm not a fan of Hugh either, but his character does have an appeal here. Oh to have men fighting for my attention.The supporting cast are as brilliant as the leads and they have some of the best lines too.I have read the book and I can say that it remains quite true to it. I like the way they use Piccadilly Circus to show her stats in the mornings as per the diary.There are so many great bits in this film and I think that even your most manly man could watch it with his girl and find it hard to say they didn't like it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Ms. Zellwegger acquits herself well in this part of a young English woman who is on the brink of giving it all up, but decides to do a major make-over with the help of her diary. There is the philandering heel of a boss (Hugh Grant, in his signature role of the hesitant talker, with his er's and um's) and Colin Firth (a particular favorite of mine). If you don't think much of Firth as a screen personality, then you haven't seen the British Television long-form (6 hours) version of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"".

"Not as good as some of Hugh Grant's other romantic comedies, but Bridget Jones's Diary stands out as one of the better comedies of 2001.","First of all, yes, I realize that it sounds kind of ironic to say that Bridget Jones's Diary is not as GOOD as other Hugh Grant movies, but keep in mind that even this hideously charming English actor has come out with some genuinely entertaining and memorable films (I am thinking, in particular, of films like Four Weddings and A Funeral and especially Notting Hill and even several of his other films that are not Mickey Blue Eyes). With Bridget Jones's Diary, director Sharon Maguire approaches the daunting task of attempting to convince the (American) public that there is a big-breasted blonde played by Renee Zellweger who has made it to her thirties without ever having had a boyfriend, and the film that results from this effort depicts the point in her life where she happens to gain two boyfriends at once.At the time that Bridget Jones's Diary was released, Hugh Grant had recently starred in Notting Hill, in which he famously uttered the words 'whoopsy-daisy,' removing any room for respect from his character that there might once have been, although at the same time making us love him whether we liked it or not as well as realize that his character was made un-respectable for that very reason. Because of this uncomfortable but ultimately pleasing love for his character in that film, we are willing to forgive a lot of the terrible things that he does in Bridget Jones's Diary, but only when we see him change from the womanizer that he amazingly plays in this film and reverts into the same caricature character that he always plays (see my Mickey Blue Eyes review) that we have grown to know and love, for the most part.Colin Firth, on the other hand, has just come out of his role in Shakespeare in Love, where he played the jerk who Viola De Lesseps was forced to marry, despite our desperate wish that she would find a way to escape the arranged marriage and marry her true love, William Shakespeare. Bridget Jones's Diary plays off of both of these past performances in the formation of its story, suggesting (erroneously) that the roles were written for the actors and greatly enhancing the effect of its plot.I remember watching this film and being disappointed from within minutes of the film that I was going to watch a childish exercise in the traditional romantic comedy (indeed, it's not hard during the e-mail trading within the office to assume that Bridget and her boss, played by Hugh Grant, are going to go through some weak romance trouble and then wind up happily in love at the end of the film). There is an interesting introduction of the other love interest in Colin Firth's character, who she hates from the moment we meet him. And, if I may interject for a moment, on a personal level, my two best and closest friendships, with Ryan Collette and Kyle Blount, started exactly the same way. When we met in high school, there were times that we were literally inches away from fistfights, and now, several years later, they're brothers to me. There is nothing that I wouldn't do for them or them for me, and it's interesting to consider whether something like this inspired the introduction we see of Firth's character into the film or whether the writers were simply trying to come up with something original.In any case, it doesn't matter, because while the film doesn't exactly generate the most respect in the way that it plods through its content (some of the interactions between Bridget and her two men are less than convincing, which is nearly catastrophic because the success of the film depends exactly on whether the audience is convinced of that very thing), there is a genuine element of not knowing how the story is going to end up. We are torn between our love for some of Hugh Grant's previous characters (as well as our expectation that the more well-known actor will end up victorious regardless) and our hatred from Colin Firth's character in Shakespeare in Love alone (a testament to the quality of that movie as well as to his performance within it) in trying to decide for ourselves what is to become of Bridget Jones's love life in the future.There's a scene where this indecisiveness between the two suitors comes to a climax, when they both get into a fistfight in the snow-covered street, but the uncertainty of who she is going to end up with pursues until near the end of the film, when it becomes progressively obvious. True, this is not the best love story ever presented on film, but Bridget Jones's Diary is definitely one of the better romantic comedies of the last few years.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Quite fun,"Finally got around to seeing this movie and it was better than I was expecting. It turns out that the book / movie is just one big homage to Austen's Pride & Prejudice, so quite naturally Colin Firth has to play Mr Darcy.

Brilliant masterpiece,Bridget Jone's Diary is of course the book that was made into a movie. This movie was released in 2004 mostly for European countries. Renée Zellweger plays the main character called 'Bridget'. Bridget is in her late 30's and is not married; she is very concerned and starts to keep a diary. Now starts the movie. Colin Firth and Hugh Grant co-star as amiable men that she falls for. Other actor/actresses like Jim Broadbent and Gemma Jones also co-star. I would give this movie a 10/10 for an excellent script. The movie is very humorous and shows different personalities of all the actors. The movie does contain sexual references and swearing so watch out if you are seeing it with younger children. Renee shows how wonderfully she can fake an English accent in this movie as well because of course she is American. This is probably one of the best pieces of works i have seen from Colin Firth as well. The movie must have been good you may think because there was a follow-up. The movie soon spread to America and critics from over here also give it wide remarks. I would recommend this movie too you 100%. Thanks for reading this and have a nice day!

Bridget Jones's dreary,"In the early 1990s, British newspapers were suddenly filled with columns written by journalists suffering from the arrogant delusion that their own lives were an subject matter of interest to their readers; journalists who often, with a startling lack of awareness, expressed shock and surprise when some of those they ridiculed in their articles (spouses, friends, etc.) took public offence. In response Sue Limb started writing the 'Dulcie Domum' column in 'The Guardian', an entertaining spoof whose fictional author was a struggling writer, whose limited understanding of the implications of their own words was the best part of the joke. 'Helen Fielding's 'Bridget Jones's Diary' came later in 'The Independent', but was very much in a similar vein.In both columns, the terse style of a diary was used to invoke images of complete catastrophe in a minimum of words. Arguably, both belonged to a tradition started not in newspapers at all but by Sue Townsend in her 'Adrian Mole' books a number of years before.'Bridget Jones', of course, had much more success than 'Dulcie Domum', although the writing was actually less good. But its subject matter, that of a thirty-something woman looking for love, had more resonance, I like to think because the concept was implemented with some subtlety. Bridget was a woman with deeply ambiguous feelings towards the romantic dream (of getting married, having kids etc.) that seemed to have passed her by; but was also a woman with little self-confidence whose erratic mood and behavioural swings owed much to her inability to handle the knowledge that she'd failed to fit the only approved template for a woman's life. The hidden tragedy was that if only she could think more of herself, she might find her life (disasters included) was actually not so bad. The column thus sympathised with Bridget, laughed at her, but contained also a degree of feminist anger at the way social values can on occasion reduce even highly competent women to states of emotional imbicility. But popularity brought popularisation: a move to 'The Daily Telegraph', then to hard covers and finally to celluloid.And the load of witless drivel that is this film.The original idea has here been reduced to a sub-Austen story about a beautiful but utterly ditzy idiot (with an apparent mental age of about thirteen) appearing in lots of sitcom-inspired moments of excruciating embarrassment, and falling in love at the same time. In many respects, the film character is the sort of person the original Bridget might have feared (when at her lowest ebb) she would become if she didn't find a man: a recognisable caricature of herself, but not the same thing at all. The essential angst of Bridget's condition is not dwelt on at all (the original was reliably single except for occasional one night stands, the film version claims to be afraid of being left alone but actually has no shortage of chasing men); while the dry comments of the diary, instead of inspiring the imagination as they did in the columns, in the film simply underscore already obvious incidents (the use of pop music to re-enforce every other point is also crass). Meanwhile, the overall direction of the plot is telegraphed from the start. American Renee Zwelleger manages of British accent of sorts, but her social class is wrong (she sounds far too posh): indeed, the essentially middle class dreariness of the original Bridget's life is traded for something altogether more glamorous (and fake). The film also invites us to accept her self-assessment as ""fat"" as face-value (it's true she fattened up for the role, but this tells us nothing except the perverse standards of actresses).'Bridget Jones Diary' is romance for teenagers (the smutty, unfunny jokes and exaggerated swearing also confirm this). Incidentally, a new report out last week said there are far more single men than woman in Bridget's age bracket. But there's no market, I guess, for films that encourage men to do themselves down and identify with characters as juvenile as the Bridget who is represented here. The implications of that statement are even more depressing than this monotone film.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

A woman in search of intimacy finds herself,"I checked out this movie with suspicious, squinted little snake eyes, intrigued by all the hype, but on the lookout for gushy sentiment and romantic drivel.  Boy, was I surprised.Bridget Jones is a 32-year-old, single, working woman, who has decided to trade some of her independence for a romantic relationship.  She's thinking marriage. Her difficulties arise from the fact that, while she's charming, attractive, spontaneous, trusting, and perfectly sincere, she's not terribly bright.As she enters this new stage of her life, she begins to journal about it. Ms. Jones narrates the film in the third person, as if audibly writing in her diary, a great way to get inside the personal struggles of the heroine.Basically, in the course of her personal quest for a relationship, she's confronted with a choice between `intensity' and `intimacy,' the one offering danger and excitement, the other safety and excitement.  They look alike, but they're not.  The first type of relationship is your typical `cosmic' romance, in which some poor dumb idiot is always looking for a `soul mate,' who is always disappointed that nobody is perfect enough.  This person is usually codependent.  The second type of relationship, while less dangerous (it's a peculiarity of the human psyche that people are more sexually attractive to us when we associate them with danger), offers warmth, acceptance, mutual individuation, and self-expression.  It's the joy of intimacy based upon clear-eyed acceptance of each other's strengths and faults.There's a great scene in the video, where Bridget throws a dinner party for her friends.  She's a horrible cook, and the meal is, by all accounts, hard to swallow.  In a jocular mood, her friends argue over which of several courses was the worst.  But it's not malicious.  It's the kind of jesting that is totally affirming, that fully accepts Ms. Jones in spite of, and maybe also because of, her shortcomings.  Now that's intimacy.",,Anonymous,Romance
Surprised at quirky casting,"I enjoyed the movie thoroughly. However, I don't understand why a foreign actress had to be recruited to play the leading role. I found myself very distracted by her accent which, while it was a reasonable facsimile of a ""southern counties"" accent nevertheless failed her occasionally. Perhaps, were I not British I would not be aware of this.

"Hated the weight comments, but was still entertained","A romantic comedy with some serious flaws, but one that's also relatable and fun. It still won me over two decades later on the strength of its cast, the sweetness that underlies all of its bawdiness, and, let's face it, because I'm a sucker for this genre.The major problem, which I hated, was the repeated commentary about the character's weight, especially as Renée Zellweger wasn't at all overweight no matter what she did for the part, and didn't need to ""lose 20 pounds,"" which was her character's New Year's Resolution. I hate to think of the message that was sending to women at the time, especially young women. There is also some office behavior that's inappropriate to say the least, but in the film's defense, it's done by the bad guys in the film (Hugh Grant in a refreshing change, and a dorky pervert).Despite the issues, Bridget Jones as a character is so relatable, as flawed and awkward as she is. Her speeches are hilariously bad, and she always seems to making the wrong choices in life. When she sits at the head of a table full of smiling couples, all of whom turn their heads to her and ask her questions about why she's still single, it's a wonderful moment. I'm not sure I was 100% convinced about Zellweger's British accent, but her performance as a whole was quite good, and it was impossible not to empathize with her character. Colin Firth is also solid as her childhood friend Darcy (referencing of course 'Pride and Prejudice'); he's awkward in a different way, that of being overly reserved. It was fun watching him beat the hell out of Hugh Grant's character, and what a sweet moment it was when he and Bridget Jones's other friends ate her disastrous home-cooked meal and had fun with awful it is. One of those friends is played by Shirley Henderson (aka Moaning Myrtle), and in an added bonus, we get to see her literally crying in a bathroom. Overall, quite entertaining.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Surprisingly worth watching,"From the hype surrounding its release, I expected very little of BJD. I'm not generally a fan of mainstream films, especially romantic comedies; I'm not even going to mention the term ""chick flick"" (oops!) as I find it (the term & most of the movies described as such) utterly offensive.Anyhoo, a friend got this out on DVD and I found it fairly consistently amusing. It wasn't offensively soppy, the characters, while still pretty stereotypical if you are used to more realistic, non-mainstream cinema, were at least slightly less commonly used stereotypes and there were a fair few laughs to be had for someone who expects at least a modicum of wit and intelligence from a comedy script.I can't, in general, stand Mr Grant, and Colin Firth has been so typecast of late as a terribly ""nice"" fellow without much substance; Firth played true to type - I too found myself wishing Bridget would tell him to p*** off, she was so much better than him despite her human frailties - but Hugh Grant was surprisingly not bad.

So I approached this movie with some supreme caution, reluctance and even dread.However, some 90 odd minutes later, I have to say what a joy it was!Lonely Girl (Bridget): identity crisis, getting old before her time, a dreamer, but scared of getting left behind as a cranky old spinster.Total Cad of the Highest Order (Cleaver, Bridget's boss): womaniser, lier, betrayer of naive women's hearts; handsome, a weaver of words and irresistible to Bridget.Boorish Barrister (Darcy): lives in a suffocating world of vacuous, society, people, boring jobs, boring lives; and shackled to the most hideous wife-to-be imaginable.All three are inextricably linked, yet who will Bridget ultimately find true love with?Yes, this kind of story has been done to death, Yes, it had a very predictable storyline, Yes, it was dreadfully clichéd, Yes, it stretches realism hugely, Yes, it yet again gave a rather stilted & blinkered view of jolly old upper-middle class England, Yes, it had a very telegraphed ending.But you know what? I couldn't care a jot!For it was pure, simple entertainment: I cared not about any of the above; I cared not how the film didn't live up to the expectations of the book; and I really cared not whether a ""plump"" Bridget Jones could really hit it off with a two very handsome men!Just take the film at face value and leave the cynicism on the doorstep.My wife loved it, and I was very entertained by it, especially with its light humour & slapstick; and of course the rather feel-good ending.For a person who prefers far more weightier genres & more thought-provoking scripts, I didn't think I would ever enjoy a rom-com. But on this occasion, I am happy to admit I was totally wrong! Bridget Jones, is a total delight.****/*****",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sweet,"Bridget Jones's Diary is such an adorable movie.  The characters are like the characters in Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.  Bridget being the Prejudice Elizabeth, Hugh Grant as Mr Wickham and Colin Firth as the Prideful Mr Darcy.  It is a sweet little movie especially when Bridget and Mark Darcy are talking because it just is so sweet especially the end of the movie.  It made me go ""awe...""",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Horrible,"This movie is extremely overrated. It's not funny at all and Bridget Jones was so annoying!!!!! She really got into my nerves. I wanted to enter into the movie and kick her ass. Anyways, this movie was a cliche from beginning to end and I hated it. I use to love romantic comedies but it seems that the genre is going downhill. This isn't as bad as ""someone like you"" but close enough. 4/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant!,"Absolutely love this film. It is one of my favourite romantic comedies and I can watch it again and again without getting bored.I think Renee Zellweger fits the bill perfectly for the part of Bridget Jones and she didn't do badly with the British accent. Hugh Grant plays a different character to what we're used to when in romantic comedies, but it is definitely a good thing. It was great to see him in a role that wasn't a charming, soppy, romantic guy. And as for Colin Firth - phwoar!! He didn't have to try and be lovely, he just was! He was effortless at being Mark Darcy, and I am very glad he played the part (he's one of the reasons I just lurve watching it over and over!).It's a funny, soppy and sweet film and I would recommend it as a great chick flick...though I will say, less of the ""f"" words and I would love it even more - I know, you're thinking: is that possible?",,Anonymous,Romance
First rate acting spoiled by weak direction & BAD music.,"Though we've seen him in this character before, Hugh Grant does a great job. Renée Zellweger is fine as Bridget, in a variation of her recent character sketches.  and Colin Firth convinces as a halting, up-tight barrister.But the directing is sloppy, there are a few problems with continuity, and it is painful and embarrassing to sit through the sappy pop music used to portray the characters' feelings.  This becomes a bad version of soap opera or MTV.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"witty, charming utterly adorable comedy with Renee at her finest.","This movie is about a single woman's journey to find herself as well as Mr. Right. It's a sweet, poignant movie with warmth, humor and depth and very well done.This movie also made me a Renee Zellwegger fan. I saw it on the big screen and got into it wholeheartedly from the beginning. This movie combines a witty script, featuring classic comedy with great acting. Renee is perfect for the lead role, as she was utterly charming and whimsical in this.Actually Hugh Grant was pretty good as well, It's difficult for me to think any female wouldn't love this(of coarse everyone has the right to their own opinion). I found Bridget to be a very realistic character as well as the characters of many around her. The attitudes that were shown toward Bridget as a single girl are indeed very realistic even in today's times.I'd say this was one of the best movies of 2001 and a movie I'd wholeheartedly suggest seeing, to anyone who may not have seen it as of yet.It's warm, witty and fun. I don't think a part two was at all necessary though.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

An American Pride & Prejudice,"Having held the two books by Helen Fielding about Bridget close to my heart, I'll admit I was a little apprehensive about seeing this movie. I was excited about the casting of Colin Firth as Mark Darcy for innumerable reasons, not least of which was the question of the scene in the second Bridget book, when she interviews Colin Firth. Will they have him play himself and Mark Darcy? I wondered. But I guess I'll have to wait for the (much anticipated and hoped for) sequel for the answer to that question. As the credits rolled, I immediately noticed that Andrew Davies name appeared as one of Fielding co-conspirators on the script. Knowing that he wrote the adaptation of the BBC Pride & Prejudice mini-series in which Firth played Austen's Mr. Darcy, I thought that I might see something a little different from the Bridget Jones Diary I know and love so well. And right from the beginning, it appears that the intention is to cleave the books together much more than in the original incarnation. Mark Darcy is much sweeter in the book, and Bridget is much less independent. Mum gets her tv job for her, and overall she is much more reliant on her friends and family to guide her than she is in the movie. They've boiled down the story to the Bridget and her two romances, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. To try to include everything would have required a four and a half hour mini-series along the same lines as P&P. I think they've accomplished what they've set out to do. They've made a happy little romantic picture based on a limited Bridget. She's been Americanized so even though Renee does a great British accent and scarfs down Branston Pickle (ugh!)this movie really is most palatable to an American audience who might not take to Bridget's hard-drinking and ultimately British ways.Oh and Hugh Grant was good too.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Dvd diary: The cheapest one,"I bought this dvd for 30 cents. That equals one and a half plastic bags. I was a bit uncertain if I have the courage to buy Bridget Jones and is it a wise decision... but it was so cheap that I had to do it. I like Renée Zellweger and I sometimes have this weird feeling that I want to buy some chick flick which probably is not going to be to my liking - but it feels adventurous and there's always the chance of finding something surprising.I bought over 10 movies but the first one that I put in the player was...you guessed it, the curious abnormality and black sheep in the middle of my thriller pile. Reality hit me...what have I done?. The movie is playing, no turning back!Ok, the beginning was quite good. There were some funny moments and I liked the characters. But somewhere in the middle it started to lose the edge and the last third was mostly very boring. I get it that the movie is based on a book which, like the title says, is like a diary. I believe it probably works better as a book? Or maybe both versions only work for certain type of audience. For me it felt like the movie did not have a consistent plot. There was too much time when the story felt like going nowhere. Well, I guess that's also the whole point - that Bridget doesn't know which man to date, so that causes some random waddling. But I think it could have been done better.I liked Zellweger because she's cute, and good at playing a funny awkward character. Hugh Grant was also as cool as he can ever be, even though his characters are always pretty much Hugh Grant. Not a terrible movie, not even annoying. Just a little bit too boring for me.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Totally Underrated,"This has been one of my favorite movies for the last two+ decades. The characters are terribly relatable: awkward, witty, raunchy, lovable, and sometimes too honest.The film follows the love life of a thirty-something woman in England and gives a spot-on glimpse into the female mind. Fantastic friendships, crazy families, love triangles, insecurities, humorous mishaps, overthinking, falling for the wrong guy... this film has it all. Honestly, I feel like Bridget is me.I love it so much I even bought the DVD for my grandma when it came out. It probably had a bit more profanity and sexual innuendos than she was comfortable with. But it's right up my alley!If you're looking for a more realistic chick-flick that will keep you laughing and smiling through most of it, look no further than Bridget Jones.(Note: the two sequels aren't as good; so maybe just stick to the original.)",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Easy. Let's just print another one.,"I was a bit late picking this one up. Still, it seemed worth viewing late, rather than not at all. Renee Zellweger, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth star in this not overly complicated love triangle story. Bridget is infatuated by her boss, who becomes more interested in her the more weight she loses and the more unattainable she becomes. Firth, in the role of Darcy (no, not his role in P&P) is the third person in the triangle. Some of the lines are genuinly funny. Zellweger's character as famed by the book that preceded the film is excellent, as are her co-stars efforts. The supporting cast is at best one-dimensional which is unfortunate. This is down, I feel, to the constricts of time, rather than of ability. Nicely paced and an uncomplicated story are always a boost for a mass audience appeal, which this has in spades. Think Four Weddings & A Funeral' meets Notting Hill' and you are in the right area. Not a classic by any stretch but follows a successful and pre-determined route to box-office millions.

The most stereotypical crap that came out of Hollywood...,"Movies are supposed to be entertaining, informative or maybe even a little bit of both, and I know that most movies out there fail to do any of those things and Bridget Jones is one of those movies. But why?It's the stereotype of stereotypes. Let's do a checklist:Desperate single woman: Check!, two guys that wants her: Check!, she ends up dating both during the movie: Check!, the guys fight: Check!, sexually oriented jokes throughout the movie: Check! and finally a standard Hollywood ending: Check!If you have seen a romantic comedy, you know the drill. Sure, my expectations weren't high, but dear god, this was bad. The character's had ONE personality trait per person, the acting wasn't anything mind-swaying, the script was lame and the movie was incredibly predictable.If you've seen one, you've seen them all.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Spiky RomCom That is Working its Way Towards Classic Status,"In structural terms, BRIDGET JONES DIARY doesn't have too much relationship to its source; the diary-form is soon abandoned in favor of the basic romantic comic plot. What the film does have, however, is a winning central performance from Renee Zellweger in the eponymous title role; many of her thoughts are heard in voice-over, and director Sharon Maguire has great fun exploring the distance between such thoughts and what really happens in Bridget's life. In many ways she is an idealist, perpetually in search of the ideal boyfriend but doomed to spend her life with lowlifes and/or cads. As Daniel Cleaver, her boss and one-time lover, Hugh Grant is a perfect example of this latter kind of person, the guy who protests love for Bridget on the one hand while trying his best to exploit her credulity on the other. The film also brings out the story's Austenian echoes; Colin Firth is wonderfully standoffish as Mark Darcy, but he understand his true nature from the way he stares at Bridget, even though he moves scarcely a facial muscle. Proud of his public image as a hotshot lawyer, he finds it difficult, if not impossible to acknowledge his true feelings - at least until the climactic fight sequence with Cleaver. BRIDGET JONES DIARY also contains at least two memorable cameos from Gemma Jones as Bridget's mother - whose antics put her daughter to shame - and Paul Brooke as Mr. Fitzberbert (or Tits Pervert as Bridget calls him), Cleaver's snobbish sidekick. In short, a film that improves with repeated viewings.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Kind of fun but hard for me to relate,"Another movie I was drug to by my girlfriend. I went into the picture with no expectations. What I saw was a silly little romantic comedy. Though don't get me wrong, the film was not without its charm. Other users wrote that this movie captured the singleton life at 30 dead on. It is hard for me to relate since I am a bit out of the target range being a young committed male in my 20s. However, I did enjoy several of the film's funnier moments. After it was over, I was generally pleased with the film.Its faults (like so many romantic comedies) lie in the completely predictable plot (I mean this one was super-predictable!) and the mega-cheesy and ultra-predictable ending.The merits of this film are the wonderful performances of Renee Zellweger and Hugh Grant. Zellweger's bumbling Bridget provides most of the genuine laughs of the movie. The film did provide good characterization of the Bridget character; we are left caring about her at the end.I was pleased to see Hugh Grant in the role of sleazebag for a change. He plays it with comedic style. His behavior in the movie provides the rest of the genuine laughs. This is the best role I've ever seen him in as he really makes the movie funny.FINAL RATING: 6/10 A good genre film. Fans of romantic comedies will no doubt love it. Other movie fans should be able to find something enjoyable about it. A good way to pass a Sunday afternoon.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

It's only a movie,"Some IMDb commenters are taking this movie way too seriously - it's a comedy for heaven's sake! Like many other best sellers, the book is no literary masterpiece, so it would be surprising if the movie was on the level of, say, Philadelphia Story.Yes, the film's sexual politics are hardly ""correct"" - though many thirtyish women seem to find no difficulty in identifying with Bridget -and its portrait of Britain displays the usual Richard Curtis (sorry Sharon Maguire!) cozy stylisation - with almost all the faces as white as the inevitable snow. But Zelwegger, Firth and Grant are all excellent, and there are lots of laughs. In particular, high praise to Renee Zelwegger, who as well as having a near-perfect English accent, projects that mix of sexiness (though muted here) and vulnerability that makes her appealing to both male and female members of the audience.One specific criticism - the fight scene is a tad too savage and prolonged for a movie of this kind.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I don't get it...,"I found it difficult to imagine this movie to be a real life situation that I felt like writing this short review. I reckon it was meant to target the dull spinster audience in order to cheer them up and inflict the idea that there is a chance for them all. Well, this is not something bad as long as one could imagine something like that happen in real life. But to go so far as to believe that two handsome and accomplished young men could fall for this Bridget is highly improbable. I'll just be blunt: Bridget is silly, dull, ugly and a bit too old for the part. But don't get me wrong; this is not exactly that which disturbs me most but the fact that she doesn't do anything to enhance her personality and physical aspect.I strongly believe that the axiom inflicted by this movie- take me or leave me; I am the way I am and I won't change- is not a healthy guiding line in anyone's life. Everybody has to work in order to get something or to reach somewhere and strive not to comply with dullness, stupidity, fatness, narrow mindedness or whatever else one has been at a certain point in life just because there might be people who ""will definitely like me the way I am"".It kind of reminded me of ""She done him wrong"" and Mae West who appeared in such a great contrast with the young, absolutely charming Cary Grant...I've waited the till the end for certain changes in Bridget's behavior or aspect but since this is not the idea the film wanted to convey I'll just sit on the back sit and let you others marvel at this movie because for me it was quite disappointing.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Love, Laughs, and a Touch of Nostalgia","Bridget Jones is such a realistic character that it's almost impossible not to identify with her-at least, that's how I felt. She's a 32-year-old single woman searching for a stable relationship, professional success, and, above all, self-discovery. Her personality is an adorable mix of humor, vulnerability, and charm, which makes it easy for the audience to connect with her.Bridget Jones's Diary is a very well-made romantic comedy, filled with funny moments and even some touching scenes. The film manages to balance humor and emotion effectively, keeping the viewer engaged from start to finish. The narrative, though simple, is captivating, and the pacing, in most scenes, is so well-measured that there's little room for dull moments.Renée Zellweger is absolutely perfect in the role of Bridget Jones. Her performance is so convincing that it's hard to imagine another actress in the part. In the supporting cast, I'd highlight Colin Firth and Hugh Grant, who bring extra sparkle to the film. The dynamic between the three actors is one of the production's highlights, with chemistry that leaps off the screen.The film's soundtrack is another aspect worth mentioning. Composed of great hits from the 2000s, it takes us on a nostalgic journey, perfectly complementing the tone and atmosphere of the story. The songs not only enhance the scenes but also help create an emotional connection with the viewer.However, not everything has aged well. Some moments and dialogues feel a bit dated today, reflecting values and ideas that no longer resonate in the same way. Perhaps this has caused the film to lose a bit of its initial charm over the years. Even so, it's still worth watching, whether for the first or the tenth time.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Based on Helen Fielding's hugely popular novel,","This romantic comedy follows Bridget (Renee Zellweger), a post-feminist, thirty-something British woman who has a penchant for alcoholic binges, smoking, and an inability to control her weight.

Another good example of British humor,"""Bridget Jones's Diary"" is another okay romantic comedy with British humor. It is neither a great movie neither a bad movie. Just acceptable and watchable, but without bad surprises.This movie is in the same line as other British romantic comedies such as ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Notting Hill"", which wouldn't be surprising (considering they are all from the same producers and they all star Hugh Grant). I personally consider this neither better neither worst than those two movies that I mentioned.Nevertheless, it's a reasonably entertaining movie with its fun. Its most positive points are: a good soundtrack (""All By Myself"", ""Respect"", ""Out of Reach"" and ""It's Raining Men""), some beautiful landscapes of England, the British humor (despite some offensive lines), the blue soup made by Bridget Jones (I wonder how that soup tastes like) and a hilarious fight between the characters Mark Darcy and Daniel Cleaver.I also like the way how Renée Zellweger portrays Bridget Jones. Not that she is really great, but she's funny in the way she portrays this silly character. Hugh Grant is cool with this performance as the charming ""playboy"" Daniel Cleaver. But this isn't exactly a movie that I would want to add in my film collection.Overall, a funny movie and a full plate for any fan of the peculiar British sense of humor. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys British comedies. As long as it is not taken too seriously, this movie can be easy to enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Between oddball and screwball: near-perfect comedy,"Romantic comedies seem to have a hard time in reviews, they don't seem to get the truly high ratings other types of movies get. Perhaps this is because they are slightly predictable and generally wearing a bit thin.Not so this one. Helen Fielding, who wrote the bestselling novel 'Bridget Jones's Diary' also co-wrote the screenplay and co-produced this film, which was probably a good thing. Instead of standardized, stereotyped U.S. romantic comedy stuff, we get some truly wacky British humour, somewhere between oddball and screwball, but never in bad taste (the elk sweater early on is as bad as it gets ;-) ).Considering the number of copies Fielding's book has sold, the plot probably needs little comment. Bridget Jones, age 32, tries to find a man for fear that she may die a spinster and be eaten by alsatians.Great acting from Renée Zellweger, who manages to portray Bridget as clumsy, chaotic, but also as very likeable and believable. Despite the fact that there were many traps for overacting, she managed brilliantly to come across as a person rather than a caricature. Kudos.Hugh Grant was finally cast in the perfect role. This is so much better than the type of character he usually plays. I don't think he's a great actor or particularly good in this film, but this role was just so perfect.Colin Firth as the other possible love interest seemed very distanced and strangely cold -- that's okay considering his role, but I felt he should have thawed a bit more towards the end.Of the remaining cast, Jim Broadbent stood out in a brief, yet remarkable performance as Bridget's father.All in all, one of the better comedies this year. Usually I'd give it an 8, but this has a serious acting bonus for a great ensemble who seemed to have enjoyed themselves, so I'll give it a 9.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A film with major problems.,"I can't say I hated this film at all, though I have a lot of pretty major problems with it. Ok, the first: I don't think Briget is a likeable or sympathetic character. Her romance with Mark seems not only contrived but also lacks even the slightest chemistry or realism. Its little more than a ridiculous feminine fantasy lacking anything deeper, like actual emotion for instance. Her boss is a much more realistic and likeable figure - he makes one mistake and has to pay for it over and over again. The fact that he doesn't want to settle down with Briget and get married, etc, makes him evil. Are men then meant to wait their entire lives for the perfect woman and forsake all others? Come on. Secondly, it bothers me that for an English film to be accepted by America (I class this as an English film very loosely) it seems that it has to be concerned only with the dull lovelives of obnoxious upper middle class London media types, who amount to less than 0.1% of the population. As an Englishman I see nothing of the England I know in this film, or in Sliding Doors, Notting Hill, etc. Thirdly, the music is gut-wrenchingly appalling. Having said all this, I still don't hate it.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I haven't read the books, but...","I think this movie could have been better.  While I loved Grant's portrayal of Daniel as well as Firth's perfectly understated portrayal of Mark Darcy, I couldn't help but think that Zellweger wasn't the best choice for Bridget. Weight gain or not, she's hardly the average-looking woman that I assume Bridget is in the books.  The idea that someone this cute would have trouble meeting a companion wasn't particularly convincing.On top of that, Zellweger's Bridget seemed downright happy-go-lucky, not weighed down by her situation.  There was very little bitterness, if any, on display, and Zellweger didn't communicate the kind of desperation you'd expect from this person.  While she spoke/wrote of eating and drinking too much, these were usually presented comically and had no dramatic weight. There are real people in the same sorts of predicaments who pacify their disappointment in drink and food, and it's rarely cute or comical.  The movie would have benefited greatly from a truer representation of Bridget's disappointment, making the ending that much more satisfying.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Nothing like the book, for better and worse...","I think I'll start by saying that I am not a fan of the book, which I found rather childish and pointless. Therefor I had no higher expectations when I went to see the movie. But fortunately I was proved wrong, I think I can honestly say that apart from the names Bridget Jones's Diary (the movie) is nothing like Bridget Jones's Diary the book. And in my case that was a good thing... for a while.Strangely no matter how dull the book is I get slightly ticked off if the movie doesn't follow it. And in Bridget Jones's Diary there are very few elements that resemble the book. On the upside, the movie runs smoothly and all parts are equally entertaining (for the most part). On the downside the movie is such a far cry from the book that I wouldn't recognize them if they didn't share the same name.So for the acting; Hugh Grant is great, and a lot less annoying than usual. Colin Firth was way too dry for my taste but I guess that's how Marc Darcy is. Renee Zellwegger did have me impressed, especially with the accent, I saw her in Jerry Maguire a few weeks ago and was stunned at how different she sounded and looked. Bridget's friends are fine, although you see VERY little of them.But honestly my main problem with this movie is that Bridget (and Renee Zellwegger) are NOT overweight. According to the BMI calculator 136 lbs on a 5,5 foot frame is HEALTHY! Bridget's BMI would be 22.6, that's normal. Over 25 is overweight. It's really sad the way Hollywood (and other parts of entertainment) makes 136 lbs out to be overweight.I guess I'd give it (with the cut scenes that were hilarious): 7½/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Zellweger Saves This Movie,"The movie based on the novel by Helen Fielding is a bit of a misnomer. Despite, a few moments of observations told with the delicate staccatos of Renee Zellweger's inner monologue, the diary doesn't really fit into the story all that much. What the film should have been called is Pride and Prejudice 2000. Not to say that a loose adaptation of a classic is a bad idea it's just you don't have to be so obvious about it.Our charming protagonist Bridget (Zellweger) is a bit of a hot mess. In the words of potential love interest Mark Darcy (Firth), ""she smokes like a chimney, drinks like a fish and dresses like her mother."" Bridget decides to mend her ways in an effort to find ""true love."" This promptly gets the attention of her boss Daniel (Grant), a notorious flirt and head of the publishing company she works for. Bridget comes to believe Mark and Daniel are acquainted and not on good terms. So naturally her budding relationship with Daniel causes a further rift while the accident prone Bridget juggles her work, her love life and her family. As you can imagine not everything goes according to plan.All of he film's charm lies squarely on the shoulders of Renee Zellweger. The film goes through the motions as if it were in a trance yet she somehow makes everything bearable and even enjoyable. Much ado was made when she, an American was cast in lieu of a British actress. Rest assured her effervescence, her wit and her accent all make it through the picture unscathed. Truth be told finding a comedic character of this depth and verisimilitude is near impossible these days and for a female character to be this utter likable is a testament to Mz. Zellweger's abilities.If only the supporting characters and competing love interests were as fully developed. Both Firth and Grant do their best yet neither fully succeeds in winning me over. Firth's rendition of Darcy acts like he's come in from an entirely different movie and only adds to the plot when a certain bit of information needs to be conveniently pushed to the side to become a dramatic macguffin later. Grant on the other hand can play many roles including a romantic lead but being a deceitful wastrel who ""wants to make a change;"" oh brother. The less I say about the completely wasted talents of Jim Broadbent and Gemma Jones the better.As I've said before the magic behind the source material i.e. ""Pride and Prejudice"" is it's universality. Despite two centuries of wide circulation, the Jane Austen novel works because it ultimately is about finding yourself within the context of a stifling social structure. To that end Bridget Jones's Diary succeeds until the very last act. Instead of a shrewd Elizabeth Bennet meeting the stoic Darcy on equal footing sans pride or prejudice, we get Bridget coveting a man she knows she loves yet hardly knows and is willing to brave the cold in her underwear to prove it. Bridget Jones is not a subversion of rom- com clichés (or the lives of landed gentry for that matter), it's a submission to the idle, unworkable fantasies of romantic love that to be quite frank has warn out it's welcome in the 90's.Lacking the sharpness of the original source material and willing to submit itself and its audience to sentimentalism, the film is nothing more than your average run-of-the-mill romantic comedy made pleasant by Renee Zellweger. Bridget Jones's Diary should be viewed only to watch Zellweger find her muse in the rich inner-life of a single woman in her 30's fearing the looming threat of spinsterhood. Single people be warned, this movie is liable to push you into bad decisions; don't fall for the hype.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bridget Jones's Diary: A Romantic Comedy to Fall in Love With,"""Bridget Jones's Diary"" is a delightful romantic comedy that brings to life the spirit of Helen Fielding's beloved book. Renée Zellweger shines as Bridget Jones, capturing the awkwardness and endearing charm of the character, making her relatable to audiences. Bridget is a woman who's figuring out her life, navigating romance, career, and friendships, all with a humorous twist. Zellweger's performance is both engaging and believable, and her British accent is spot-on.The film features Hugh Grant and Colin Firth as Bridget's two potential love interests, each offering a unique dynamic to the story. Grant plays the smooth-talking Daniel Cleaver, a charming but unreliable character, while Firth's Mark Darcy is serious and reserved, yet surprisingly tender. Their contrasting personalities add depth and complexity to Bridget's journey of self-discovery.What sets this film apart is its perfect balance of humor, romance, and heartfelt moments. The script, co-written by Richard Curtis, is sharp and witty, and the story is filled with scenes that will make you laugh, cringe, and even shed a tear. The chemistry between the cast members is palpable, especially during pivotal scenes like the infamous fight between Daniel and Mark, or the iconic line, ""I like you very much... just as you are.""
Beyond the romance, the movie touches on contemporary themes such as gender roles, workplace dynamics, and self-image. These elements give the film additional layers of interest and make it more than just a typical romantic comedy.If you're looking for a film that's fun, charming, and emotionally resonant, ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" is a fantastic choice. With its lovable characters, engaging storyline, and memorable moments, it's a romantic comedy that's sure to leave you with a smile.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Funny stuff,"A movie that gets the amount of attention that ""Bridget Jone's Diary"" has received is thought to have some deeper point to it, but pretty much like ""Notting Hill"" or ""Four Weddings..."", this one is very, very enjoyable without actually having one. I'm not saying that it is completely pointless - I'm saying that the diary of Bridget Jones really doesn't reveal anything revolutionary or cast any new light on men vs. women. Some men are a**holes, most are not. Some women are degraded gold diggers, most are not. Most people are just like Bridget Jones - willing, kind and really low in the confidence department. Therefore, all the fuss about this being such an ""insight"" is bull. In the end Bridget Jones just wants stability, love and calm and shies away, quite rightly, from sleazy s.o.b. men like her boss (Grant)It is a very funny movie though - not quite in the caliber of ""Notting Hill"", but still a good laugh. The acting is impeccable (with that cast it would be impossible to miss), Zellweger, Grant and Firth are all enjoying their respective roles so clearly, some of their good mood spills over the brim.Good fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
a good film you won't want to miss,"""why there are so many women unmarried nowadays?""maybe 3 main options,I think:1. don't want to get married due to several reasons. 2. want a marriage, but no choice at all. 3. want a marriage, have choices,but don't know which one is the Mr.right.Bridget Jones belongs to the second one.Jamie O'Neal's song ""All by Myself"" tells how Bridget feels deep inside.She is truthful,lovely,a little awkward, trying very hard to find someone to be with for life.She is unlucky to start an office relationship with a wrong person who is like a playboy.However, she is also lucky.Her directness attracts another man and she is carried by his word ""I like you, just as you are"".(I think it is the most romantic word I have ever heard.^^) Since it is a comedy, laughter goes along with the film and I think you won't forget the last scene of the film.Just like other romantic comedies,a happy ending is there, Bridget and Mr.Darcy get together at last.^^(I know in BJD II,the two are at the brink of breaking-up,but luckily,they still get together AT LAST. however,personally,I don't like the sequel. )Renee Zellweger is a flexible actress.She can play a rough county girl with a strong accent and a little husky voice in ""Cold Mountain"" and a passionate sexy girl in ""Chicago"". Her Bridget is also vivid. she did a great job.no doubt she got the Oscar.It is really unexpected to know Hugh Grant plays Daniel.In my mind,Hugh Grant usually plays those romantic good man,like Charlez in ""4 weddings and 1 funeral"" and the guy in ""Notting Hill""(sorry, forgot the name). It was really hard for me to re-build an image for him when the film goes on, but he did a good job.As to Colin Firth,I knew nothing about him before this film. But he is exactly the right person for Mr.Darcy who is deeply hurt by his previous love. Besides,his appearance reminds me of the original Darcy in ""Pride and Prejudice"".A good match I believe.(Colin's role in ""Love Actually"" is also this kind.)I have seen this film several times and enjoy it every time.I recommend it without any reservation.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Delightful Comedy,'Bridget Jones' is a very pleasant American comedy with all the ingredients of best movies of this genre. Though the environment is British and very well described BJD has charms that only good American brilliant comedies have: think to 'When Harry Met Sally'.The cast is very good and the story funny and a little predictable like plots of this genre always are.I think it was a long time I hadn't seen such a good brilliant comedy!,7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I liked Bridget Jones: she is different,"This  movie is extremely pleasant, funny and endearing.  It is also a relief to break from the typical perfectly successful, thin, invariably rich blonde that one finds in the American movies from the same class with Bridget Jones (such as ""When Harry met Sally"", ""Sleepless is Seattle"", ""You've got mail"" etc.  Love Meg Ryan, but sorry! have to be honest.) Bridget is different especially through her ability to think about what she is and what others are.  And, as some of us know, when one has a world inside one's head, sometimes one goofs with the world outside!  The script could have been better, sometimes things go too fast, I think.  But it follows the book and it doesn't disappoint. Renee Zellweger delivers a performance decidedly worthed an Oscar, she has the talent of a great comedienne.  Colin Firth is wonderful (as Mark Darcy), he can do a heartbroken, handsome, rich divorce like no other (hopefully he can do more than that!).  I love Colin Firth in all his movies that I have seen; unfortunately, his presence in this one gives the movie an air of unrealism, because the guy is too handsome not to be snotty and vain.  But because he is so unbelievably good natured, he makes us dream that he could be a real man.  Hugh Grant succeeds in being annoying, which is the purpose of his character (Daniel Cleaver). One should not accuse the movie or the character Bridget Jones for lack of philosophic depth, for imperfection, pretentiousness, or anything alike, because this movie is not trying to show how we should be, but is just telling a story of how some of us are.  The story is beautiful, the characters are well contoured and there is enough romanticism (see unrealism!) to make one dream and want to see the movie again, or read the books again. Another excellent point for the movie is that it is definitely not targeted to the half-brained sex-obsessed American teenage generation.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Renee a big improvement over Nurse Betty,This movie is a pleasant improvement over Nurse Betty.  Renee does an outstanding job of managing an English accent though out the movie.

This is not an academy award movie it is a pleasant hour and a half.,7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Women like to be patronized...,"After watching Bridget Jones' Diary I have to admit I almost didn't make it through. I was left with a bitter taste in my mouth. Do women really want to be patronized? The whole idea that men can say whatever women want to hear and women take it in is absurd. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth's characters are truly sad excuses for the male race. Overall this movie was truly overrated, and horribly annoying. If I ever say to a woman ""You're totally obnoxious, but I love you just the way you are"" I'd like someone to humanely destroy me. Not in any way Oscar worthy.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bridges over a violent apparition,"One can only ponder the workings of Husserl, of many believed to be the father of phenomenology, as a violent and shocking apparition is bound to be experienced. I have never, in my 63 years of living, been inclined to comment on something so banal, and utterly useless, as ""music"". I am, however, in this case compelled by the siren call of a young child, nay, a woman (I'm told), in which a heavily set spectre appears from above to ""set the scene"" (so to speak). Did hamlet scream his final words in this very way? Did you, as I, write in this ""diary"" during childhood? Did it compell you to speak to the apparition? Did it make your very flesh shiver and shake, in awe of its gigantic appearance? ""Leave the world behind"", says Bridges in this movie, ""let us move from this phenomenological realm of pure duration into that of the mind, the flesh, the mind"". Bridges might be an avid follower of Plato, however, I am not.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Empty-headed but likeable,"Don't expect too much and you will probably be delighted. Renée Zellweger turns in an excellent performance as the single woman old enough to feel she should be seeking a life partner. Essentially perhaps a woman's movie (many jokes that a man might need explained) it is generally however an accessible, light-hearted comedy and a better (if not outstanding) as a film that the popular but overly-lightweight cult novel. Hugh Grant, as one of her suitors, turns in a predictable but amusing performance in his undemanding role and the movie manages to prattle on for over an hour and a half without once getting boring.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great choice for holidays,"I don't think of it as an eight but definitely higher than seven. The plot is light and fun, and the characters are VERY lovable. VERY entertaining to watch. It's also fun to just think about how this film was produced so many years ago and how the story was situated at that time but still brings happiness to people today even though reality of the world differs much. Maybe the reality has never been in the way films are demonstrated to audience. What we need to and should perceive from films are simply arty stories and what's carried behind them.

"Second time I watch this one, still not impressed.","Since a brand new Bridget Jones came out my wife and I decided to watch all the previous ones to understand the whole franchise better. I remember watching this first movie before, one that I wasn't impressed with to be honest, and that didn't change with my second viewing. My wife liked it better than me. I guess this kind of chick flicks is just not really my thing. Renée Zellweger acts like a teenager, Colin Firth is just a stuck up English gentleman and Hugh Grant plays an arrogant and rather annoying womanizer. No real hilarious scenes so in my opinion not really a comedy. Tomorrow we will be watching the second movie, one that I didn't watch before, in the hope it's a bit better but I won't hold my breath.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bridget Jones really is the indisputable queen of second hand embarrassment,"The main reason why the movie was so much better for me than the book is the fact that Bridget was actually likable here. I mean, yes, she's still a completely mess and truly beyond awkward 95% of the time, but it's almost always done in a way that's loveable and endearing. She's not self-absorbed or pathetic (like in the book), but instead she's kind, gentle and even funny.I also understood her romantic choices a lot better in this movie than I did in the book. First of all, Hugh Grant plays Daniel in a way that actually almost makes him seem charming rather than despicable and disgusting (like he was in the book), so it makes sense why Bridget would fall for him at first (before she sees his true nature, of course). It also made more sense why she disliked and distrusted Mark at first, since Daniel lied about Mark sleeping with and stealing his fiancee (which, once again, did not happen in the book, so there really was no reason for Bridget not to immediately choose Mark then, who was clearly already the better option). Nonetheless, I don't want to say Mark is perfect either, though. I don't quite understand why he kept dating with and even got engaged to Natasha when he was clearly in love with Bridget. That's kind of mean to the other girl and almost makes me feel like he's not a great person either. However, he is still better than Daniel by miles and miles, because at least he always chose Bridget and clearly adores her, but yea, neither romantic option is truly great.All in all though, this movie was just very charming and lovely. Bridget's awkwardness was entertaining and often times even cute.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Unintelligibly, unfunny, uninteresting, unetc.","BJD as a romantic comedy is perhaps one of the most unhilarious films of the last ten years. There is little true romance and no comedy whatsoever in a disjointed story that pales in comparison to its source, the namesake book. BJD has average journeyman performances, a horrible production design making for an ugly image and a story that meanders without any direction, other than Bridget's adventures with two men (neither of whom is remotely sympathetic). There is no inner core to the protagonist but a shallowness that detracts from any suspense as to what might happen next. As a result, watching Bridget becomes embarrassing and boring rather than exciting and funny considering the intent of the story, that of an obese 30 years old who wants to find a man. The whole film seems like an exercise in throwing out everything that worked (Bridget's great female friends, for one) in the book and keeping the worst parts (the parents and their excruciating friends) that ultimately fail to add up to anything. To add insult to injury, the editing (cuts) is so fast that most of the time this viewer was unable to see what had transpired. Stay away from this stinker.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Cult Cringe Comedy,"An icon of RomComs, Bridget Jones's Diary is at least funny throughout, topping most others in the category. Casting is point perfect (who would even know Zellweger was an American) for all, and the script, presumably lifted from the book, is witty enough.I'm not one for RomComs, but I cannot deny that in all areas this is one of the better ones. The lead is relatable, surrounding characters all have their own personalities, the plot isn't predictable, and it's just fun.It's more than bearable for that half of the couple not interested in watching it, it's actually enjoyable.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Broken Wing Attracts Male Every Time,"I went into this movie expecting to find a sad and funny tale of loneliness. What I got was an atavistic lecture in antediluvian sexism. Never mind if a woman is slovenly, overweight, smokes, drinks, and totally inept: all that matters is that if she appears pathetic enough, and speaks like a sex kitten, she will snare The Right Man (older, richer, smarter, and higher class) who will then Fix Everything. The last scene says it all: Bridget in Underwear in Snow Embraced by Protector. Please. As for men who do not fit the perfect mold, well, they're Losers and don't deserve sex. And as for attractive, competent women, well, they're ""Stick Insect"" castrating witches.This movie displays a reversion to sexual politics as crude and pathetic as anything I've seen post-feminism. Its myopism is the funniest thing about it. Bridget can hardly see that she is imitating perfectly her mother's choices and is headed for exactly the same misery. Maybe that is the film's subtle message, but I won't give it the credit of being that intelligent. Too bad, because the cast are all fine actors.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Highly original and definitely has its moments.,"There were times during this movie when I laughed out loud and couldn't wait to see more, other times when it put me out.  Ordinarily I don't complain about a film's content, but ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" does seem to have a lot of gratuitous bad language and some really crude dialogue that doesn't serve its story or quality.   I guess I *am* one of those people who gets tired of hearing f***ing-this, f***ing-that every few minutes, so if you're one of those people as well, you may have trouble really getting into this movie.  Still, the leading performances are excellent: Zellweger tackles the accent nicely (Definitely will have any American fooled, and we are pretty starry-eyed discerning when it comes to those English throats.) and Colin Firth is perfect as the sexy, straight man in the reindeer sweater opposite Grant as the slimy but oh-so-cute jerk.  Add to this the movie's ""novel"" approach to providing a glimpse into the world of your average man-troubled, work-a-day, hate-my-weight unmarried young lady, and the results are poignant but still sweet enough to evoke dreamy sighs from the female audience and appreciative chuckles from the males.   I wouldn't consider this a chick flick; more like an accurate Slice 'o Life from the girl's corner that is funny and multi-tiered enough to entertain anyone. Minus the vulgarity of her goofy friends, plus the cute subplot of her parents' marital woes, plus a splendid street brawl between the two roosters, and assorted jokes and wit throughout = a really fun evening alone for someone who can truly sympathize with poor Bridget.  Now if only the rest of us could have such luck landing a guy like Firth...My Score: 8.0",,Anonymous,Romance
"Entertaining, funny, a bit predictable","I saw BJD last night with my wife, who has been asking about this film for weeks now.  I kept putting it off, thinking it to be another clunky, formulaic romance film.  I wasn't exactly incorrect, but the film is rather inventive in how it handles some conventional situations.Renee Zellweger did a fine job as Bridget Jones, although it's difficult to see why men would find her physically unattractive, even with the modest weight gain Zellweger had for the movie.  I thought she looked terrific. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth (one of my favorite underused actors) swap their normal roles around for this film, and both are outstanding.  Grant is the sophisticated, ethically challenged Lothario, Daniel Cleaves (nary a stutter!) while Firth's character seems almost unable to break outside of himself at all.  You can feel Mark Darcy's tension, his wanting to express himself and his despair at not being able to do so.  I'd say Firth's performance is easily the best in the film.Unfortunately, but not too importantly, the crucial plot twists in the story are pretty obvious to anyone with half a brain, especially the one concerning Cleaves and Darcy.  In the meantime, there's a lot of edgy humor in watching Jones bounce from disaster to disaster, trying to exceed her own abilities and in a few instances succeeding.  Some people have commented on her lack of moderation in drink, tobacco, and sex and how that made her unsympathetic.  That seems to me to be a somewhat sexist point of view, as many films feature male characters with the same exact issues, and these manage to garner sympathetic reviews.One last note: Previous reviews have mentioned ""Someone Like You"" in comparison to BJD.  My thoughts were on ""Circle of Friends"", which dealt with an overweight central female character trying to break free of her own expectations and those of the people around her.  While I really enjoyed BJD, and CoF doesn't have the same edgy humor, I think CoF does a much better job of handling the central conflict of both films and treats the characters better.  (Colin Firth is also in CoF, although he is in his traditional jerk character.)  When Bridget Jones' Diary comes out on DVD, my wife will be clamoring for a copy, and then we'll put both on the same night and have a film duel!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"The ultimate antidote for the singles' blues, ladies, do pop it in the tube whenever you need it!","Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) is headed to her parents' home for a New Year's gathering. Again, she is going alone, with no boyfriend in tow. Once there, her parents re-introduce her to an old childhood friend, Marc Darcy (Colin Firth), who is divorced and a hot-shot, human rights lawyer. However, Marc insults Bridget, accidentally, and Bridget sees him as a stuffy, boring gentleman, too. So, a romance between the two of them seems mighty improbable. Back at her small apartment, Bridget gets a bit tipsy but makes a New Year's resolution to keep a diary. It will record the doings of a thirty-something, biological clock-ticking lady in London. Soon after, book publicist Bridget receives some overtures from her handsome but lothario-like boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant). Unbelievably, Daniel takes a shine to Bridget and they begin a ""thing"". Yet, this leave-it-to-Cleaver has wandering eyes and Bridget is about to be on the receiving end of his infidelity. Horrors! On the upswing, Bridget and Mr. Darcy, that is, Marc, meet time and again, by happenstance, and their icy feelings for each other appear to go through a semi-thaw. Is it likely that ""our Bridget"" will find true love in the early 21st century? This is a wonderful movie and a true antidote to the cares of the world, especially for women everywhere. Most of us, like Bridget, are insecure, a bit overweight, and clumsy at love, among other things. Therefore, it warms the heart to see the underdog succeed. As the main character, Zellweger is nearly flawless, exhibiting high humor, a sunny nature, and self-deprecation in perfect pitch. Then, too, Firth and Grant are likewise terrific as her love interests; in truth, no one could have played these roles better, either. All of the secondary actors, Jim Broadbent, Gemma Jones, Shirley Henderson and the rest, are quite fine, too. As for the setting in London, it is lovely, as are the nice costumes and camera work. Above all, the script, based on Helen Fielding's best-selling book, and the skilled direction are to be greatly admired, for they absolutely capture the essence of the unhappy, aging-by-the minute single woman in her thirties. If you were to keep a diary of your own movie views, dear reader, do make certain you include BJD as an entry. In fact, it is one of those films to watch whenever a spiritual ""pick me up"" is needed.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bridget Jones's Diary,"I was watching a documentary on the late Dame Maggie Smith the other day that was narrated by the amiable Celia Imrie (herself still awaiting that particular gong) and she brings that affability to this rather dated but enjoyable comedy drama too. It's all centred around the loveless ""Bridget"" (Renée Zellweger) who hasn't had sex for a while and has the hots for her floppy-haired boss ""Daniel"" (Hugh Grant). After a few rather embarrassing encounters, they finally do hook up but then she discovers he's a bit of a rake and takes a new job in television working for sleazebag tele-journalist ""Finch"" (Neil Pearson). Thanks to an incident with a fireman's pole, that doesn't exactly go to plan either, but it does offer her the opportunity to get it together with posh barrister ""Mark"" (Colin Firth). Now she's known him for a while but took an instant dislike to him at a curry party, so what's changed? Has she discovered a new penchant for striped suits and wigs? I remember reading the book at the time and feeling a certain degree of sympathy with old ""Bridj"". It was just at the start of the now all-encompassing validation culture when we'd dial 1471 on our land-lines when we get home only to find nobody had called (again) and where office instant messaging was rendering scuttlebutt obsolete as gossip and flirtation became the order of many a professional day. It's that culture of feeling needed, liked and wanted that Helen Fielding encapsulated so well with this character. Hapless, yes, but decent and given a chance - loving too. Zellweger delivers charmingly and enthusiastically, as does in a more roguish form Hugh Grant. As to Firth, I'm never quite sure how much acting he ever actually does anyway, but here his contribution works well too. It does struggle almost a quarter of a century later to resonate - especially the fisticuffs in the restaurant scene, but it still has enough wit and pith in the cleverly crafted and observational script to raise a chortle and be grateful for a series of daft scenarios that poke fun at the whole business of courtship amongst the young and the old.

However, viewing the movie again a number of times over the years showed me there are many things that are wrong with this film. Look, Renee Zellweger has a good performance (though right now, her cinematic persona has kind of overstay her welcome). The plot is basically about Bridget having to choose between dour lawyer Darcy (Colin Firth) or sexy cad Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant). Neither of them is a very satisfactory individual. Arguing who was the best guy for her, as I did in my original review is besides the point. Besides, what is more off putting about this film is that Bridget stupidity is supposed to be representative of the modern woman.

He is just so charmingly befuddled...,"I'm tempted say the romantic comedy for people who love and indeed for those who hate them.It's just so archetypal it has this strange anthropological fascination about it. One watching thinks ""so THIS is where it all began!""It's understandable that there is an audience for those movies who tap into psyche of that person in all of us: the sexually mature child desperate to navigate grown-up land with its grown-up jobs and its grown-up relationships and where in the most seemingly normal settings, we live in quite desperation, hating ourselves for what we have not yet become and cripplingly lonely.Thus it is unplattonic love that must come to melt the frostiness of life and guarantee us approval and companionship we can (supposedly) rely on.It's easy to love Bridget; a sort of Miranda Hart before we had Miranda Hart. Not cool or suave, just doing her best. Vulgar when called for (and maybe even when its not), Zellwegger truly was born to play this role and was an idiot not to keep the weight because she never looked better and she speaks more Englishly than most of my compatriots! (I know that's not quite true but it's fun to think).Yes, Bridget is hot even though the subtext is somehow that she isn't but you have to just over-look that.The plot of falling in love with the wrong person and then finally the maybe right one won't stimulate anyone but is certainly unpretentious.The Austen element is superficial at best or maybe its just incidental.

Renee stars in a funny and entertaining film,"A delightful film which accurately and skilfully adapts Helen Fielding's unusual novel for the screen. Key to the film's success is Renee Zellweger who is truly outstanding as Bridget. I expect that a few eyebrows were raised when an American actress got the part of the quintessentially English heroine  but Ms Zellweger delivers a performance of such authenticity that you soon forget her Texan roots. It is not just her accent (accurate though that is) but she IS the epitome of a thirty-something English girl of modern times. She is Bridget Jones.As with most movies in which Richard Curtis is involved below the surface of the very funny script there are some quite serious undercurrents running. These include the fact that groups of friends are a source of strength when times are difficult. We saw this in ""Four Weddings"" and ""Notting Hill"" and we see it again here. Indeed some of the best moments involve Bridget's support group with James Callis particularly good as the gay faded pop star.Hugh Grant and Colin Firth bring to life the very different characters of Daniel Cleaver and Mark Darcy and there is a delightful cameo by James Faulkner as the predatory Uncle Geoffrey. But the best supporting performance is Jim Broadbent who believably portrays Bridget's father coping with the mid life crisis of his rather barmy wife.The soundtrack is also good  worth buying the album.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Excellent!,"Excellent. This is as good as romantic comedies come. It is witty, intelligent and funny. I rarely give such high marks (especially for this type of movies), but this film really deserves it.

A big ho-hum.,"I saw this film last night, and it was an audience filled with women andgay men. There were a few laughs, but mostly titters and sighs. Thisfilm feels like soft-core porn for the unmarried woman- plain chubbylittle Bridget Jones has two-  TWO! handsome men fighting over her,despite her messing up every single situation she finds herself in.Fairly well crafted, terribly lit, with a wall to wall sound track ofhits that tell you exactly how to feel and when,  this is a pre-fabmovie if ever there was one, lacking soul but filled to the brim withcutesy little moments that don't add up to much. I read the first reviewhere on the IMDB- by a person who, oddly enough, has yet to review anyother film- and feel like the Miramax pr team has a mole here on theIMDB. Perhaps there should be a rule about no reviews appearing untilthe film has actually opened- but that's neither here nor there. Readthe book instead, it's richer and fuller and has real committedcharacters. Renee Z was cute, yes, but afraid to really commit to therole- can anyone really picture Bridget Jones making love while keepingher bra on!?  And she does this TWICE in the film! Oh well. It's an okaymovie if you have a pack of girlfriends and a little alcohol in you, butgo and read the book first- it's much better.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good, but if you've seen 1 Brit rom-com, then you've seen 'em all...","Movies like this always seem to follow a set formula, and most of them star Hugh Grant!: Loveable idiosyncratic loser has a series of mishaps before finding their perfect 'dream partner' and settling down happily ever after.

All of which isn't intended to suggest that ""BJD"" is a bad film.  It's quite the opposite in fact, it's just that this particular sub-genre has been so well MINED by Brit production companies that its in danger of becoming a target for parody before too long, much as ""Scary Movie"" did with the ""Scream"" series.Honestly, if this is your sort of thing then watch it, because it's not bad at all.

A-1 at Lloyds,"I went to see this film with the sister of my old girlfriend yesterday, and from the cues of people who were waiting round the block to see it, I knew I was not going to be disappointed.I, like most of the entire cinema-going population of Britain, were apprehensive at the thought of an American playing a character that would be deemed to be quintessentially British, but I need not have no fear, Renee Zewellgger as Bridget perfectly captured the neuroses and worries of modern-day life, making them all the more pointedly because we were shaking our heads off in fits of laughter that threatened to demolish the whole cinema.I, (who could be described as a thirty-something male singleton), could relate to Renee as Bridget, a person constantly on a state of alert about her job, her weight (Memo to Cosmo - Stick-Insect Women are not sexy, they look ridiculous), and about whether they will ever meet a soulmate for their life (Memo to Feminist Reviewers of this film - this does not portray women as gooey morons, just real people). Hugh Grant to me encapsulated perfectly the arrogant so-and-so who women will always go for and ultimately be broken hearted over to a T.  But Hugh Grant as the mean and moody Mr Darcy, (now there's a coincidence!), to me shows that just perhaps just being there for someone shows their true worth.Bridget is not a pushover, her treatment of Mark as she revenges his treachery is an outstanding hoot, and she will not be deflected from her life, at the risk of losing the one person who would be best for her life, (apart from her dad, brillantly and poignantly portrayed by Jim Broadbent.)The snow at Christmas time in London and at Bridget's parents may seem to be contrived, but I've experienced White Christmases before and it only enhances a film in which you cheer for the happy ending yet hope she will not lose one iota of her dignity.99 out of a 100. for you losers who don't like it, get yourself a reality check and a life!",,Anonymous,Romance
It would have been better had I not read the book,"I have mixed feelings about the film. It was an enjoyable romp with a pretty good cast and a few good laughs. However, having read the brilliant book beforehand, I was supremely disappointed at how much the movie differed. I rented the DVD and was disgusted that the ""deleted"" material was all stuff that came from the book!! Renee Zellwegger was *okay* as Bridget (great accent) but she just lacked...something. I pictured Bridget as a little bit prettier and a little sassier. Her friends really took a back burner in the movie, too, serving no real purpose. Oh well. :o)",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absolutely charming romantic comedy that will make you laugh and feel good,"BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY, in my opinion, is an absolutely charming romantic comedy that will make you laugh and feel good. If you ask me, Mark (Colin Firth) was more suited to be Bridget's (Renée Zellweger) prince than Daniel (Hugh Grant) was. I said that because Mark was more of a gentleman that Daniel was. Anytime Mark and Bridget kissed, I got all warm and tingly inside. In addition to that, I went, ""Aw!"" Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this absolutely charming romantic comedy that will make you laugh and feel good to any Renée Zellweger, Colin Firth, or Hugh Grant fan who hasn't seen it. You're in for lots of laughter, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Timeless feel good movie,"Bridget Jones's Diary is such a fun and charming movie! The characters are incredibly relatable, especially Bridget navigating love, work, and self-discovery. Renée Zellweger gives a brilliant performance, making Bridget both hilarious and vulnerable. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth bring their own charm, and the chemistry between Zellweger and Grant makes every scene they're in together so entertaining.The plot feels timeless - the journey of someone searching for love and self-acceptance never gets old. Bridget's struggles with confidence, relationships, and trying to balance her life are things everyone can relate to. What really sets this movie apart are the amazing gags and witty humor that still hold up today. From awkward dinner parties to diary confessions, the comedy is spot on without ever feeling forced.The supporting cast also adds to the movie's charm. Bridget's friends provide some of the funniest moments, showing how important friendship is during life's ups and downs. The soundtrack perfectly matches the mood of the film, with songs that feel both nostalgic and empowering.Beyond the laughs, the movie has a lot of heart. Bridget's journey isn't just about finding love - it's about embracing who she is, flaws and all. That message feels just as relevant now as it did when the movie first came out.I also loved how London serves as a backdrop, adding to the cozy and sometimes chaotic atmosphere of Bridget's life. The holiday scenes, the snowy streets, and those classic British locations made everything feel even more special.Definitely planning to watch all the other movies in the franchise! If they're anything like this one, I know I'm in for more laughs, romance, and unforgettable moments.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

(well tries to anyway)I loved this film and boy could I understand how Bridget felt!  Having the two perfect but different male stereo types to choose between, it got very confusing when both were on screen (all power to the actors here)Hugh Grant superb, Renee outdone her performance in Jerry Maguire and came one better here and as for Colin Firth someone who yes I had heard from due to P & P(never watched though) came completely into something of his own here and outacted everyone especially in the last half hour when we at last see the true character!!!!!!!Now I understand what they mean about feeling weak at the knees and sending your heart racing, you can not take your eyes of him in this film.  Made for the part and finely someone we can call a true British heartthrob, I really hope he now gets more big movie offers he deserves it after that performance!This film has you in laughter in one moment and tears the next. The fight scene was really good, the ending was an old movie classic brought into the 21st century and this film had a heart and soul to which you don't get often in these days of big names and big budget films.In short absolutely amazing, the chemistry between Renee and Colin made this film.  Anyone that says otherwise is wrong!  There were so many small moments that made this film from the blue soup, to the I like you the way you are, the missed the cake and went through the window fight!, the boat scene and Bridget's no, no , no!

"I myself loved the dialogue, and with that the overall mood and tone of the film.","To say that I was completely, well, delighted is probably the word I'm looking for, is a definite understatement. It's hard to believe that this film, with a cast of characters that use the word ""FUCK"" more frequently than any of the characters in Tarantino's films combined, be so romantically charming, but much like Bridget's weight, it oozes right out of its' seams. The charm, that is. I did not intend for that last remark to be offensive in any way, but it is a fact that Bridget (Renee Zellweger, whom I never really cared much about as an actress, but man was she great in this film!!) is overweight. What also is not meant to be taken to offense is the use of the ""F"" word in the film. These are everyday characters, having everyday conversations. I myself loved the dialogue, and with that the overall mood and tone of the film. This film allows you to unbutton your pants, and relax. Bridget makes you feel comfortable in your skin by allowing you to see her in just about every embarrassing situation possible...and there were plenty of those. From her being continently fixed up and dressed by her mother, to forgetting to change into her normal sized underwear before she got lucky(these being the most tame examples), Bridget takes it all in. I found myself laughing the whole time, but I realize that I was in fact laughing at myself. She is a character that in one way or another you sympathize with, because we all have had moments in our life that we were embarrassed about, but by seeing her we feel at ease. Now the performances... there is definitely some great acting in this film. It starts with Rene Zellweger's ""Raging Bull"" Bridget performance, and carries through with almost every character in this film. They are all acted the way acting should be, so that you can't tell they are acting!! I was definitely surprised at how great Rene played Bridget, the accent is right on, so much so that you leave thinking she is British and plays all her past roles faking the accents. Hugh Grant also gave a great performance, one that I was happy to see. In the role of Bridget's low-down-sex-crazed sleaze of a boss, he acts against type. We are used to the Hugh of films like Four Weddings and a Funeral, or Notting Hill(another film I loved), but in this film he sheds all that proves he's got something more to offer. You'll hate him and love him, something only the finest leading men can accomplish. I also must give a quick mention to Colin Firth, whose performance ties in neatly to the whole story, and does a great job being part of what could have become a messy love triangle story. I really would have given this film 4stars (and secretly I must admit, I love it beyond that), but it does rely on the romantic/comedy clichés in the end, or a spin on them at least. For example, the final chase scene for the one you love, how many times have we seen that? Don't get me wrong, I love that stuff. It's the best, and man it works in this film as much as it did in Notting Hill. I'll leave that 1/2 star out because in a way I wish it had found another way to work its self out. So if your girlfriend/friend/whatever wants to go see a movie tonight, make sure you skip the Freddy Prinze Jr. crap, and beg her to go see this. You'll both love it, and I expect all of you to thank me when you leave that theater with a smile on your face.",,Anonymous,Romance
Bridget Jones's Diary (2001),"Bridget Jones's Diary looks at the life of a thirty something trying to get her life on track. Of course this means finding a man. Enter the frame two suitors. The charming and funny Daniel Cleaver, and the dull and sensible Mark Darcy. Bridget at first falls into all the trappings laid by Cleaver. This is actually highly believable as Cleaver is played by Hugh Grant. Grant captures that unmistakable schoolboy charm, and blends it with his often cruel wit. It's simple to feel at ease with him, even though you know he's a bit of a cad. Firth plays himself wonderfully respectable. His inability to express himself can often be painful. At the heart of it all is Bridget Jones played excellently by Zelwegger. She isn't some desperate hussy, or lonely weirdo. She's a good role model that makes some mistakes. The humour often goes for that very British awkwardness, and the script is sometimes let down being based on a fictitious diary and all. Luckily we get some truly unforgettable moments, such as the fight scene between Grant and Firth, which is very hysterical, in both it's choreography and pacing.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Renée Zellweger plays a Brit impressively!,"'Bridget Jones's Diary' delivers enough, it is fairly amusing and moves along well across around 90 minutes. Renée Zellweger plays a Brit impressively, something that feels quite rare to say about an American actor. She is excellent throughout, particularly for the comedy.I will say that I didn't really sense any proper onscreen chemistry with her and the eventual bloke she lands with (won't spoiler whom), Zellweger had more with the other dude to be honest. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth are in this in those respective roles, no surprise to say they are both good.About time I got this watched, being from its country of origin and all that. I had heard of it for as long as I can remember, it's a popular film evidently. Despite that, the only things I knew coming into this were the lead cast and, eh, the main character's preferred choice of underwear...Oh, and I was also aware of Gabrielle's banger ""Out of Reach"", which I knew originated from this movie. I didn't, though, know ""It's Raining Men"" by Geri Halliwell (another tune, don't @ me) also gained popularity due to this. How about that.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

I wasn't sure I was going to like Renee Zellweger as the British lead, but she pulled off her accent reasonably well...and Hugh Grant was excellent as her jerky boss.  And then there's Colin Firth!  ...also good were Jim Broadbent and Gemma Jones as Bridget's mum and dad.  The director kept this movie short and sweet, and the humor works.

I Love This Film!,"For the hundreds of reasons people have already mentioned, I love this film. It is, very simply, incredibly entertaining!  Now, come my (few) non-standard reasons for enjoying Bridget Jones.  First, it was directed by a woman.  Very, very few films are (pay attention sometime, it will really shock you!), and I appreciate so much seeing a female succeeding and promoting other females to succeed through her subject matter.  Next, the way Bridget looks at men.  Do you ever get tired (really, really tired) of watching the camera slowly slide up the backside of some starlet?  Was it not the most refreshing thing in the world when the camera slowly slid up Colin Firth's backside?  Did you not want to stand up and cheer?  I most certainly did!  Finally, this was a film that displayed joy.  So many movies are just so exhausted.  Even many comedies just walk along comely, doing their thing and hoping to sell more tickets - but this was a film with heart and soul and joy and humor.  I would even go so far as to (gasp!) say it improved upon the book.  This is one of my favorite comedies of all time, and every time I see it, I just get the happiest, silliest grin on my face. If you are vacillating on whether or not to watch Bridget Jones (I really have no idea why you would be doing that or why this review matters at all, really), you must see this film~",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Grant finally gets another chance to stretch his acting muscles as a vapid womanize who prove quite unloveable...and Firth finally gets another big screen role to equal ""Valmont"" or his stage performaces.He develops his character slowly and deeply throughout the film. Special attention must be given to the wonderful Jim Broadbent as Bridget's Dad.Although not on screen for any length of time,It is another well drawn character in his ever growing list of great portrayals.

Have You Met Miss Jones?,"Bridget Jones is a single woman in her early thirties who works for a London publishing company. The title derives from the fact that she confides all her feelings, her frustrations and her obsessions to her diary. And Bridget certainly has plenty of obsessions. She obsesses about her weight, about the amount she smokes, about the number of ""units of alcohol"" she consumes and about her inability to find a boyfriend. She is haunted by the thought that she is fated to remain single forever and worries that the destiny of all single women is to be found dead in their flat, their bodies eaten by their dogs. She is so desperate for love and affection that she even begins dating her boss, Daniel Cleaver, although she is well aware that he is a notorious womaniser with a phobia about commitment.Helen Fielding's novel was a huge success in Britain in the late nineties, so much so that the phrase ""a Bridget Jones"" entered the language to describe a certain type of thirty-something career woman. Fielding deliberately drew upon Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" when writing her novel; her hero, for example, is named Mark Darcy. Bridget first meets Mark, a barrister, at a Christmas party hosted by her parents, and their courtship follows the same pattern as that of Elizabeth Bennett and the other Mr. Darcy; they start out by disliking each other and gradually come to appreciate each other's good qualities. Mark and Daniel, once friends, now cordially detest one another, and the reason for estrangement becomes clear in the course of the film. (Their relationship parallels that of Darcy and George Wickham in Austen's novel).Before his Oscar-winning performance in ""The King's Speech"", Colin Firth was perhaps best known for playing the other Mr. Darcy in the famous BBC adaptation of ""Pride and Prejudice"", so he was perhaps a natural choice for the role of Mark. Like his namesake, this Darcy is gentlemanly and possessed of firm moral principles, but is quiet and reserved and finds it difficult to express his feelings. Hugh Grant was best known in the nineties for playing middle-class romantic comedy heroes in films like ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", ""The Englishman who Went up a Hill."" and ""Notting Hill"", so playing a rotten cad like Cleaver- a man for whom the concept of morality is an alien one- was perhaps an attempt to broaden his range. (He had also played a villainous character in his previous film, ""Small Time Crooks""). He throws himself into the role with gusto, so it is unfortunate that since 2001, except in the sequel, ""Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason"", he has tended to retreat back into his romantic comedy comfort zone.Of the three main characters, it is Bridget who bears least resemblance to her Austenian counterpart. (Elizabeth is generally cool and self-possessed, Bridget anything but). The casting of Renée Zellweger in the role caused some controversy in Britain, as some felt that it should have gone to a British star. (She was to cause a similar controversy five years later when she was cast in the title role of ""Miss Potter""). The normal reason for parachuting American stars into British films is to win over those Americans who refuse to see any film unless it contains at least one well-known name, but that may not have been the reason here, given that the British actresses considered for the part included such internationally-known stars as Helena Bonham Carter, Rachel Weisz and Kate Winslet. The film did, however, prove two things about Renée Zellweger. The first is that she can do a splendid English accent. Like Gwyneth Paltrow in ""Sliding Doors"" she manages to make her character sound convincingly like a middle-class Londoner, avoiding the twin traps of making her either too posh or too cockney.The second thing we learn about Renee is that she has a gift for comedy, particularly important in the latter part of the film. (This is a romantic comedy where the stress is on the second word as much as on the first). Bridget leaves her job in publishing and becomes a television reporter; she tackles her assignments gamely but incompetently, and normally ends up making a laughing-stock of herself. Yet all the time she remains sympathetic, not merely ridiculous, which is important.Another feature is the witty use of pop music, using titles which have some connection to the plot of the film. Examples include ""It's Raining Men"", ""Have You Met Miss Jones?"" and ""Can't Take My Eyes off You"", each of which occurs at some pertinent point in the action.There is nothing very deep about ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" unlike, say, ""Four Weddings."" or ""Sliding Doors"", both of which display a greater degree of ambition than one would normally associate with the rom-com genre. It is, however, a likable and occasionally witty comedy, one of the better British romantic comedies of the 2000s. It is certainly better than the below-par sequel. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Loved it!!!!,"I've read the book more than once, and was a little leery of the film, but those fears were completely unfounded.  This movie was truly one of the funniest I've seen in a long time.I know that some feminists don't like this character, but they just don't seem to get it. I am a woman of a certain age and, while I can't say I know anyone who is exactly like Bridget, I can say that every woman I know has some elements of Bridget in her.  Whether or not the anti-Bridget factions like to admit it, women have always obsessed about their weight, or about men, or about their parents, or whatever.  What the people who snub their noses at this book/movie fail to see is that Mark Darcy has his own neuroses.  This is a man whose mother who shows a dubious taste in Christmas gifts (but he loves her enough to wear them in public), a man whose wife had an affair with his best friend (but is too much of a gentleman to discuss it), a man who wants to have fun but who isn't really sure just how.  Hence his attraction to Bridget.  But since the story is told from Bridget's point of view, we dwell on her problems, not Mark's.  Bridget is Everywoman, and Renee Zellwegger turns in a stellar performance in this role.Colin Firth, who was a fine Fitzwilliam Darcy in the 1995 version of Pride & Prejudice, is, in my humble opinion, even better as Mark Darcy in this modern twist on the Austen novel.  Hugh Grant should stick with playing cads and forget about the stammering leading man he has played once too often. He is wonderful as the Wickham-like character who has no scruples about taking what he wants, regardless of the consequences.Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent are terrific as Brigdet's parents.  Jones is delightful as the ditzy mother who goes off to ""find herself,"" only to discover that her real happiness lies at home.  I would have liked to have seen more of Broadbent, but it was not to be, unfortunately.From what I gather, the closing credits seen in Europe are different from those seen in North America.  While Europeans get to see interviews with Bridget's family and friends, we North Americans get to see home movies of Mark's 8th birthday party. Not surprisingly, Bridget is the life of the party; she stuffs cake into her mouth and strips down before jumping into the paddling pool while Mark sits quietly and watches.

Cheerful comedy entertainment.,"Bridget Jones: ""Now, I'll go home and... DE-bunny"".The story is about a post-feminist, thirty-something British woman who has a penchant for alcoholic binges, smoking, and an inability to control her weight. While trying to keep these things in check and also deal with her job in publishing, she visits her parents for a Christmas party. They try to set her up with Mark (Colin Firth), the visiting son of one of their neighbors.This movie could have fell flat on it's face by it's cliché story about a women that needs a man in her life, normally I hate those movies but this one I like, because the movie itself knows what it is and tries to be something new and clever with it's story and it's main heroine, and that's what made this movie worked. The writing in this movie took all the same story that has be recycled over and over again and made something good out of it, taking away the stuff that we seen before and putting something new and clever. This has to be Renée Zellweger best role that she was in. Playing the cheeky, caring and witty person that she is. The rest of the cast Colin Firth, Hugh Grant and Jim Broadbent did a great job in they roles. My only nick pick with the movie is the ending for me. It's not a terrible ending but it could have been better.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
simply fantastic,"What is it that makes Bridget Jones's Diary such an addictive film? Perhaps it's the great combination of wit, reflection, self-analysis, drama, romance and sheer hilarious situations. This is the story of Bridget, a very real British woman with many issues, mainly weight and romance related. Greatly portrayed by Renee Zellweger, Bridget is both witty and interesting, making for a purely enjoyable film. I first watched this film when it was released in 2001. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Three years later, I gave it my second viewing, and since then, I must have watched it over 100 times. I honestly can say that this is the ONLY film I can watch everyday if given the opportunity. Although not the best film, and perhaps without much depth (not to say none), Bridget Jones's diary is somehow addictive and absolutely enjoyable. Definitely set to be a classic, this is a film that all people should view at least once, not because it's philosophical or because it makes stunning comments on society, but because it is simply fantastically entertaining.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Colin Firth delivers his signature understated charm, while Hugh Grant brings a playful, roguish energy that adds fun to the love triangle.The film balances humor and romance well, with plenty of awkward yet amusing moments that make Bridget an endearing protagonist. While the story remains predictable and occasionally leans on rom-com clichés, it compensates with sharp dialogue and a heartfelt narrative.Overall, ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" is an engaging and entertaining rom-com that stands out thanks to its lead performance and humor. It may not reinvent the genre, but it delivers plenty of laughs and heart.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
So warm and lovable,"Bridget Jones's Diary is a wonderful romantic comedy that has a lot to say about how people in their 30s are judged when they're single as well as poking fun at everything from workplace relationships to awkward family gatherings. It moves quickly and has a central love triangle with an obvious outcome and set of twists but that doesn't hinder how investing it all is, especially when things go seriously wrong.Renée Zellweger is so endearing as Bridget Jones. There are a fair few embarrassing moments which only enhances her likeability and throughout it all there's a relatable quality to her. Colin Firth is the epitome of a nice guy here as he delivers one bad insult at the start and then spends the rest of the film making up for it. Hugh Grant's endlessly dashing charm is in full effect and almost lets him get away with stuff he shouldn't.Sharon Maguire's direction gives the film a nice level of warmth that peaks in the snowiest moments. There's a lot of fun to be had in the general playfulness of it too thanks to Bridget's narration and the way it allows different versions of big scenarios to play out back to back. The soundtrack is equally playful with a collection of songs chosen for how obvious they are to use, only making them funnier.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Satisfying and sweet, 'Bridget' is candy for the mind and soul","This flick was a refreshing change from the usual romantic comedies that have been showing up of late. Mark, Daniel, and Bridget all had a prior history with one another, adding some depth to their motivations. Bridget's parents gave her another dimension, as a more complete person. Renee looked positively zaftig and hot, which just underlines how unhealthy the (weight/body type) standards are for screen actresses nowadays.Not having read the book, I cannot comment on the job the writer/director did in translating it.

Lovely flick about a sick skirt... among other things.,"Though in plot somewhat different from the book in spirit it captured the written text supremely well. The characters, the humor, the comedy of the situations that charmed us all in the book are all present.

What a nice change Bridget is from the ever present popsy pretty Barbie dolls that America always has to stick into their romantic comedies. How wonderful to hear for once some snappy conversations rather then the ever flat usual burble. And finally, how nice to see real characters and people rather then washed out dolls ( I know I mentioned that before. but it's worth mentioning again).

Great Disappointment,"Having read the book and enjoyed it tremendously, I was utterly disappointed with the film version (usually the case).

In the book her friends were over-the-top and such fun people to hang out with. The only saving grace is Colin Firth who plays Mark Darcy. He is everything the book described him to be!

A delightful romantic comedy.,"I really didn't know what to expect when I tuned into Bridget Jone's Diary on ABC Family.Though when I saw the very first scene, which features Bridget lip-synching hilariously to a depressing love song whilst watching an equally depressing movie on her television, I figured that it couldn't be that bad.I was right.Of course, for this to be a really good review, I would have to address the things I learned about the movie after watching it. I learned that some see in it a totally adorable woman they can relate to, and others see sexist trash.To say that Bridget isn't a terribly desperate single gal would be a total understatement. As a result, I must warn those of you females who feel that the portrayal of any such female- who, I MUST remind you still actually exist- is a jab at your independent womanhood, to stay out of this one.Although the plot in this movie can sometimes be a little predictable, Bridget is not. You never really know what is going to come out of the woman's mouth at any time- and neither does she, which adds to the entertainment.Additionally, the story is not entirely about Bridget Jones. A decidedly tongue-in-cheek side story involving her dysfunctional parents is present as well.I loved the performance of the actors in this movie. First of all, Renee Zellweger, of course, and second of all Hugh Grant, as he seemed perfect for the charming-yet-decidedly-perverse Daniel Cleaver.I certainly think that this movie is worth giving a chance to.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Screwball comedy is still alive in this modern age but needs Lombard, Grant and Stewart...","RENEE ZELLWEGER plays such a klutzy frump of a girl in this British screwball comedy that it's hard to imagine COLIN FIRTH and HUGH GRANT fighting over her. We're told that it's because she so ""natural"" that she has men buzzing around her. Well, that might be true if Miss Zellweger looked more like Carole Lombard. In fact, one could easily see this as a screwball comedy back in the '30s if Hollywood made the story starring Lombard, Cary Grant (not Colin Firth) and James Stewart (not Hugh Grant). Get my drift? Instead, Miss Zellweger looks more like pudgy Lynn Redgrave of ""Georgy Girl,"" an overweight and rather awkward young woman given to wearing tight clothing and making the most inappropriate remarks at the most crucial moments. She speaks her mind without any regard for the consequences and lands into one troublesome social situation after another because of her quirky attitude.An inside joke has COLIN FIRTH's character called Mr. Darcy--and indeed, he behaves as that gentleman did in ""Pride and Prejudice,"" at first utterly rejecting Bridget Jones and then making a pass at her which she turns down, only to change her mind before the final reel.HUGH GRANT has a thankless role as a witless cad but plays it with his usual charm, the sort of role James Stewart might have done had this been made back in Hollywood's Golden Age when screwball comedy was just as mad but a lot less risqué.But Renee, Colin and Hugh are not Lombard, Grant or Stewart and the film suffers because none of them can make this kind of material seem like anything more than a manipulative romantic comedy about an awkward girl finding her Prince Charming in a Jane Austen kind of way--with all the modern sensibilities destroying most of the charm.Unless you're a devoted fan of these stars, this one is pretty hard to recommend except as very lightweight entertainment in quirky British style, but Bridget's gaffes are too monumental to be accepted by Darcy.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"This ""Diary"" is Worth a Look See","There is something about England-based romantic comedies that have a sense of neverending charm and sophistication to them. Their stars tend to be nothing less than perfect and their words are those we wish we could say. The creators of `Bridget Jones' Diary' have filled their film with the above criteria, taking a `Notting Hill' esque approach to singles and dating in the 21st Century.The Plot: Renee Zellweger plays Bridget, a publisher's assistant who arrives at her 32nd birthday determined to reel in her life, which has spiraled into excessive drinking, smoking, eating, and dating the wrong kinds of men with the best of intentions. A running gag in the film begins as she monitors her daily intake of vodka, menthols, and crumpets. Her self induced makeover hits a bump when her mother introduces her to your typical stiff-assed, handsome Brit and divorcee, Mark Darcy (Colin Firth).Darcy's rude comments about Bridget at a Christmas party prompt our heroine to pursue her boss, Daniel (a rascally cad portrayed by Hugh Grant). Daniel ends up having a tryst with a Yankee Bridget describes as `an American stick insect,' thus ruining their relationship and forcing Bridget to re-examine her love life while facing her `mum's' mid-life crisis.The Good: `Diary' has too much going for it to fit in this section. The dialogue comes at a quick pace, sharply delivered and always funny. Zellweger goes back to `Jerry MaGuire' territory, gaining 20 pounds and constantly reminding us how perfectly cast and effortlessly adorable she is in the sappy Snow White-like role of Bridget. Grant shows a nasty side that makes us snicker and Firth is a revelation. Scenes of note are the `Prostitutes and Priests' costume party, any scene with Grant and Zellweger, and the finale's birthday dinner scene.The Bad:  Why must all Hugh Grant comedies end with a pointless car chase, whose aim is to get to one's love before they go away?  This tacky scene, and the oddly placed and flow of a street brawl between Daniel and Collin, are too American for this import.  They distract, rather than entertain. But a movie this close to perfection has to have some spoils here and there.Some pages can be skipped and it can use touches of WhiteOut, but overall, this `Diary' is worth a look see.",,Anonymous,Romance
Fair romantic comedy,"This is nice little film about an insecure (well neurotic) woman and her life for one year.The film has its moments, especially the fight scene between Grant and Firth - quite clever to get the two biggest Brit-flick heartthrobs to slug it out on a film, high irony that.  Contrary to a lot of opinion, I thought Zellweger handled the part reasonably well.  However I do agree with the opnion that she probably wouldn't have had THAT much trouble with men given the way Zellweger looks...and no-one is fooled that Jones is a bit flabby by squeezing Zellweger into a Bunny suit that is blatantly a size too small for her.A big up for Sally 'F***ing Shazzer' Phillips though, a good talent that needs more scope.Overall I found the film a bit plodding and rather predictable, but blokes can watch this and quite enjoy it - although it only really 'works' I fear, for female neurotics.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Much better than the preview suggests.,"I'm not sure what exactly my impression of this movie was when I was only familiar with the trailers... maybe because the trailers didn't make me want to rush right out and see ""Bridget Jones' Diary""... but now that I have seen it, I can say this movie pleasantly surprised me as a well written, well acted, and charming tale.On the surface this appears to be a ""chick flick""... and there are definite ""CF"" elements here... but overall, Bridget Jones is a character that everybody can identify with. A good person, suffering from a lack of self esteem, suddenly experiences the elation that new love (or just hot sex) grants a formerly lonely soul. Along the way, she looses love, gains love, looses love again, has misunderstandings, work conflicts, dealings with creepy old co-workers, (the nickname ""Tits-Pervert"" is fantastic!) it's all happened to every last one of us, woman or man, at one point in our lives.

Worth seeing for Zellweger,"Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) is 32, a Londoner, and panicking about being single.  She falls for her cold, commitment-phobic boss (Hugh Grant) and finds herself somewhat attracted to tall, handsome, arrogant Darcy (Colin Firth).  Who should she go with?  Three guesses.  Predictable storyline overcome by a sharp script, fun soundtrack and a VERY energetic performance by Zellweger.  It's her film all the way and she's just fantastic.  She fakes a British accent to perfection and carries the whole movie on her shoulders.  Also it's interesting to see Hugh Grant play a total jerk and do a very good job of it--he's played the innocent, bumbling Englishman way too often.  However, there are two very bad performances--James Callis as Bridgets' gay best friend Tom.  The guy is so obviously straight I didn't believe him for one second--but he's a minor character so it really didn't hurt the film.  What did was Colin Firth's performance.  He's tall, he's handsome, he's WOODEN!  He always has a frown on his face and is SO serious...you wonder what Bridget sees in him.  It's surprising because Firth is a good actor...just not this time around.  So it's worth seeing for Zellweger...this might be the film that makes her a well-deserved star.  A perfect date movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Read the book! PLEASE!,"I saw the film with great expectations. I read the book twice, I found it brilliant and hilarious, and I think that most ""singletons"" can easily relate to Bridget Jones.

"Not bad, but not very good either","The reason why I was not disappointed about this movie is that I didn't have many expectations. Yes, it's funny in a couple of scenes, but nothing better than your average sex/sentimentality ""chick"" flick. I didn't read the book and I still don't think it's one of my priorities but as the story was presented, I wonder who wasn't already prepared to see Bridget disappointed with one guy and switch to the other, only apparently less likeable one.

Strange what Hollywood Considers Fat or Funny,"Bridget Jones's Diary: 4/10: There have been a great number of woman's films that have successfully crossed over to the mainstream. Sleepless in Seattle, Jerry Maguire and Aliens are three classic examples of ""chick flicks"" that men can watch with their ladies, enjoy the film, and still get credit for being a sensitive guy that likes what she likes.Bridget Jones's Diary tries to come across as a frothy crossover comedy. You know one of those estrogen flicks that Hugh Grant now does since Tom Hanks was shipped off to make ""important films"". Diary however doesn't successfully crossover. It's a real chick flick through and through.The thirty something equivalent of Sixteen Candles. In fact it seems to have basically the same plot and characters as that John Hughes eighties perennial. Instead of our sixteen-year-old ugly duckling we have a thirty two year old overweight alcoholic with virtually no social skills. And instead of one impossible cute and rich suitor we now have two impossible rich and handsome suitors that fight over our protagonist.Now I have always felt Renee Zellweger was easy on the eyes and talented to boot. As for the extra weight she put on,(An act that the media with a straight face called ""brave"") well let's just say she wears it well. Her character however is such a horrible deceptive person that one really wonders why either man would want her for anything more than a quick shag.Like those other lovable raging alcoholics of the silver screen say Arthur or The McKenzie Brothers two hours of screen time is one thing but day-to-day living is another. One really wonders how long either man would really stick around with Miss Jones? (A: Till he got tired of shagging her.)One last question. What's is with the music? It's Raining Men?

Mixed feelings,"I found this movie to be good, heartwarming and funny. I couldn't stop laughing at Bridget's misadventures, or feeling bad about her problems in life.But realistic? No.Here we have an incult, compulsive, alcoholic, chain smoker, whom, we are supposed to believe, gets the affection of the most decent, intelligent, witty and educated guy on the whole movie. That is a little bit too much to believe; I can understand the physical attraction part, but no sane man with such qualifications would dare to get romantically involved with a ticking time bomb of a woman. She was a great couple to Hugh Grant's character: both were basically airheads, only caring about love and sex in the most basic of ways. In fact, being harsh to Bridget's character, even Hugh would have been bored by Bridget's... hmmm... stupidity.Maybe that was too harsh, but I tried to find something, anything of value to Bridget's character. The only thing I found was her desire to find true love. The rest was shockingly bad: she was mediocre, full of vices, dumb, incoherent at times, fat, etc.I think I am looking too much into the movie. Maybe the whole thing was an exaggeration on loneliness and the failure of a human to find a partner in this time and age. If so, then this film is simply superb. If it is meant as an accurate depiction, then I don't think it's as good.Last, but not least, the minute I saw Renee, I was shocked. Was she the same woman that appeared as a sex symbol in ""Me, Myself and Irene""? She looks *terrible*. I wonder if she gained weight in order to appear in this movie (I don't think any woman alive would do that), or if she got the part because of her figure. Terrible.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Funny  but it's really just a feature length version of Ally McBeal in the UK isn't it?,"After yet another year of loneliness and disappointments in love Bridget decides to improve her lot and find love while keeping track of her progress in her diary.  She gets involved with her cad of a boss, Daniel, but also is attracted to the upright Mark Darcy.  Will she get either or loose both?Brought to cinemas on a wave of hype due to the success of the book this was well looked for.  I've never read the book  nor do I read those type of books so I had an open mind but feared I may not like it.  The plot is relatively straightforward but is quite amusing.  The jokes are funny and some of the situations are very good.  It also boasts the most realistic fight put on film (no fancy moves or punches  just two men swinging, kicking and scrabbling around).  What put me off was the similarities to the US TV show Ally McBeal.Like Ally McBeal the film uses fantasy scenes that only exist in our character's head and she has a troublesome love life.  This is OK but it does give you the feeling you've seen it al before somewhere.  The bigger problem is that the character suffers from the same problems as Ally  in that you want her to just get a grip and grow up.  For women this is different as they may see elements in the character that they can recognise in themselves (like many men could in High Fidelity's Rob Gordon), however for me Ally is irritating as she seeks perfection and is never happy. Bridget has the same basic character and it makes her hard to get behind  the only sentiment I can say I felt for the lead was pity rather than empathy.That said Zellweger still does a good job  her accent is good and she does manage to look a little frumpy and put upon.  Ignoring the question of why they couldn't get a British actress to do it (one word  money) then she does well.  Grant is funny in a harder role than usual  he still does hi usual stammering bit but at least he's a bit more of a cad than a fop. Firth is a bit Stoney but is good and the support cast (including Jim Broadbent) are all good.Overall this is funny but it is definitely for girls as many men will fail to sympathise with the character of Bridget.  I saw some of her in many of my women friends of the same age but I still couldn't get past the idea that she was a bit irritating.  However if you like the book and you can watch Ally McBeal without wanting to slap her then you'll like this.  Even if you don't it still has some funny moments.",,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly Good,"When I saw previews for this film, as a man, I thought that it would not appeal to me. It was really by chance -- seeing it on while a former roommate was watching it, sitting down, expecting to leave within the next five minutes, but I ended up watching the entire thing, becoming completely incapable of pulling myself away from it. In fact, I would later feel compelled to drag somebody along with me to see the sequel that came out in the Fall of 2004 on opening night. It became very obvious that I was greatly mistaken.In an age where 'war' films like Pearl Harbor contain sappy romance stories, this was very bizarre seeing something that was a Romantic Comedy that was more of a comedy than a sappy, cliché Romance that makes the more sound of mind wish to vomit. I find that opposed to other romantic comedies, this one really embodies a sense of a realist's look at life, and as opposed to focusing on sexy women trying to get sexy men with horrible, predictable jokes being thrown in on occasion, this is far more refreshing. Great performances by everybody involved, and a very refreshing story overall.It breaks all the stereotypes of modern comedy, lacking any crudeness or immature antics, and it breaks all the stereotypes of Romance, giving an honest portrayal of a relationship and the attitudes of normal people, often poking fun at itself. As far as major motion pictures go, this one is a tremendous surprise as far as entertainment & content go. It is the kind of film that anybody can appreciate.If I were to make a list of films that pleasantly surprised me, this would probably be at the very top. A tremendous production.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

I left the hall fully entertained, satisfied and strangely with full of hope and a new vigor! The movie cheered me up and made me forget my sadness. I simply felt lighter and happier. And, although little over carried away as I might seem, this simple pleasure the movie brought me and the positiveness I felt is certainly worth sharing.Rene is truly truly fantastic! what an achievement for her! she totally deserves her best actress nomination and should have won it too! see the work! What an acting! A girl from the glamour world that she is and doing that and with such real effects that we can't help it but be totally CHARMED by her despite the character's many faults. Absolutely lovely and heights of romance! Back then, I did not know Colin Firth and had not yet seen him in Pride and Prejudice (Classis! Classic! Classis!). The man blew me away! I fell in love with him and set out on a rampage to find all his works! He's a perfect dream man. And Hugh Grant just sizzles the screen with his perpetual mega play boy good looks. He played his role wonderfully and was really really funny. His attitute and mannerism towards his treatment of Mr.Darcy is a roar. Darcy, so uptight and he, so loose and free - each thinking himself more up than the other. He entertained me the most! all three of them are marvelous in the movie!The story is fascinating!

A sex goddess-wannabe stumbles through romance and laughs through her tears...,"Romance and humorously-derived self-humiliation mix somewhat uneasily in this glossy adaptation of Helen Fielding's book about Bridget Jones, a British working girl with a mad crush on her boss who keeps crossing paths with a handsome lawyer whom she's known since childhood--a man who is naturally charmed by Bridget's downright clumsy attempts to socialize. Oscar-nominated Renée Zellweger (with added weight and an uncanny accent) is a perky heroine: a young lady prone to embarrassing herself in the midst of having a good time who doesn't poke fun at her mistakes and bad choices (and who doesn't allow much guff from others, either). Bridget Jones is occasionally a flibbertigibbet, but she's also a strong female character, one with drive and determination who goes after what she wants. The two men enamored of her, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth, work well with Zellweger, though the strained relationship between the guys is the worst type of movie contrivance (culminating in a fight scene that is also the very worst of its type). The film doesn't scuttle its chances at being a funny love story...though there isn't enough of either element in the first half, and Bridget's initial job as a publicity executive is just a sketch (due to the callow writing).

It essentially wears its inspiration on its sleeve and pays homage to it in a number of often surprisingly blatant ways (sure, let's just call one of the characters Mr. Darcy and see who notices, shall we?). Still, it has enough of its own personality to feel like a distinct thing. Its plot follows Bridget, a 32-year-old singleton who fears dying alone more than anything else, as she enters a loose love triangle between a soft-spoken bore who insults her the first time he sees her and a bumbling bloke who clearly isn't invested in the idea of a long-term relationship as she is. The picture goes through pretty much all the expected motions, ticking off each trope in a somewhat knowing but still ultimately checklist way. It has an undercurrent of humour that lends it some likability, but the jokes don't land often enough for the thing to be considered particularly funny (though there are a couple of moments that fit that description). It just isn't all that compelling, really. It is well-made, though, with its performances lending proper credence to the script and its occasional shortcomings. It's fine, really; I almost don't have any feelings about it one way or the other (an issue in and of itself, I suppose). Also, I'm sure that extra 's' is in the title just to annoy me (and it does, somewhat inexplicably, annoy me). 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

"""Pride & Prejudice"" II?","This film has many hilarious moments and Colin Firth still makes my knees weak, but what's all the fuzz about this story? It's a modern version of P & P sans the more intellectual Elizabeth.Instead, we have a 30 something woman who can't control her weight, drinking, smoking or doesn't seem to have any talents except being ""good-hearted"". Her one break in career came from her association with Darcy. This woman is reportedly a heroine in UK? I found her a complete anti-feminist model. Is that the point of the story? The heroine for the new millennium should be like the one for the last, sweet, a bit cheeky, a bit plum, vulnerable and thus, needs a strong man like Darcy. All the intellectual career women in the film are portrayed as cold and calculating in order to contrast Bridget's sweetness, clumsiness and thoughtfulness. It's a enjoyable romantic comedy if I take it as a pure fairy tale. Once I think it a bit deeper, the storyline bothers me.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

not really that interesting,"The overrated movie of Helen Fielding's newspaper columns and later book, 'Bridget Jones's Diary', flops onto the screen and never really goes anywhere.Renee Zellweger plays the annoying singleton who drinks and smokes a lot, mimes (badly) to junk like 'All By Myself', and thinks life begins and ends with a man. She gets two to choose from - love rat Daniel Cleaver (her boss, Hugh Grant, who flirts with her by email in the office) and sensible Mark Darcy (Colin Firth, in a part which gently sends up his Pride and Prejudice role of a few years earlier) - but, being Bridget, can't make up her mind.Is Bridget Jones an interesting character? No. She's a silly and empty-headed character, not even funny. I can't see the attraction. Grant and Firth are OK but both are playing clichéd characters. Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent are good as Bridget's parents, with Honor Blackman as a tarty co-worker, Sally Phillips as a journo who swears a lot, and Neil Pearson as a horny TV editor. There's just not much here of interest. It even snows conveniently at Christmas.Bridget Jones is something of a bore. I couldn't have cared less by the end of the movie who she ended up with and won't be rushing out to see the sequel.",,Anonymous,Romance
The history of love between Miss Jones and Mr. Darcy - almost a modern-day Austen tale,"It's talented Miss Z (Renee Zellweger) meets Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth), with Hugh Grant the Imp-erfect boss, Gemma Jones the glamorous Mom, Jim Broadbent the tolerant Dad, and Embeth Davidtz as Natasha, shadowing Mark Darcy. If you've seen the A&E 1995 miniseries ""Pride and Prejudice"" with Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, you might think that they intentionally have Firth as Mark Darcy in ""Bridget Jones's Diary."" The two Darcy's truly belong to Colin Firth, who delivered both characters with equal brilliance and restraint. The latter, being outside of Austen's landscape, provided more room for Firth's subtle comedic touch.I thoroughly enjoyed the preview of director Sharon Maguire's 2001 ""Bridget Jones's Diary."" Zellweger put on 15-20 pounds and a British accent for the lead role. Once again, she optimized the chance to deliver the role with spot-on comedic tempo - one cannot not laugh and chuckle over the endearingly clumsy, not so articulate or business smart Miss Jones in her 30's, looking for the perfect man to take her away from the life of being single.Hugh Grant certainly is taking risks these days - he was a charming swindler in Woody Allen's ""Small Time Crooks"" 2000; here in ""Bridget Jones's Diary,"" still exuding his infectious charm, Grant has no qualms in displaying the slapstick side of him, appearing uncouth and downright drenched and untidy (and 'bit of bloody, too.)The audience at the preview obviously enjoyed the movie. I was unable to catch certain phrases due to the laughter and hearty chuckles. We're having such a good time watching Zellweger, Grant and Firth interacting. The dialogs were funny and engaging, and the plot is not entirely predictable - we were kept in suspense prior to the ending. (Demonstrating how easily we assume and react, thinking at once in our own perspective vs. pause to project - oh well, an inescapable human condition inherent to relationships, indeed.)There was no ending credit roll at the preview, but the songs were catchy and finger tapping. I hope they will keep the beyond-ending segment of rolling the childhood video of Jones (at 4) and Darcy (at 8) - it sure adds depth to the history of love.Other worthwhile Renee Zellweger films are: director Dan Ireland's ""Whole Wide World, The"" 1996, as Novalyne Price opposite Vincent D'Onofrio; director Boaz Yakin's ""Price Above Rubies, A"" 1998, a substantial gutsy role as a Jewish young woman in the jewelry business opposite Christopher Eccleston; director Carl Franklin's ""One True Thing"" 1998, as daughter to Meryl Streep and William Hurt; director Neil LaBute's ""Nurse Betty"" 2000, as Betty Sizemore, another funny and sensitive role, opposite Morgan Freeman, Aaron Eckhart, and Greg Kinnear.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Pride and Prejudice II,"Hugh Grant and Colin Firth reprise ""Pride and Prejudice"" in modern dress. Heavens, Firth's character is even called Darcy!  Well, at least he didn't have to rehearse his expression or learn a new character. And he still gets the girl by playing the serious, brooding type. For all that, ""Diary"" is a lightweight, pleasant but improbable diversion. Not hard to see how how Zellweger's character got to 32 without getting married. Not real bright, no interests, no talent for anything much other than feeling sorry for herself. Felt like screaming 'get a life, you dozy cow'.

Relatable Individual,"I had completely forgotten how well done this was ... it's been a minute since I last saw this (or the sequels for that matter). But now that I've rewatched it I remember why I really liked the first one. And why this was another example of Renee Zellwegger being the go to girl/woman back then! She was the everyday woman, everyone could see herself in her or with her. She was charming, fun and just seemed to be the woman you'd want to spend the rest of your life with.Having said that, she also was accessible to a man like Hugh Grant - well the character he was portraying! I do not think I know him personally - private escapedes aside. His character is charming, yet you know something is off with him. He just can't love only one individual ... which you know for a romantic comedy is not the best partner for our female main character. We're not there yet that polygamy is a thing in mainstream movies ... maybe it never will be a thing ... maybe it will!? Who are we right now to judge such things? Exactly, let the others do the judging.Having said, there are things that are cringe worthy (fist fighting depicted as an event and some other non PC related incidents) and there are inconsistencies: while the already mentioned fist fight is based on reality, we also get a totally movie moment when breakaway glass gets involved ... of course all is just there to enterain, so while one is real and the other is fake, both are meant to be fun.

Pleasing and effective comedy about the ups and downs of seeking love.,"They say that if a man is not a socialist by the time he is twenty, then he has no heart, and that if he is not a conservative by the time he is forty, then he has no brain. So far as I can tell, ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" depicts not a man but a woman who falls somewhere in-between both these two particular ages and, as a bonus, these two somewhat rudimentary world outlooks. While not a particularly political film, it is interesting to note how it seems to push the message that men and women are better together, and that individualism and empowerment is all well and good, but will ultimately lead to loneliness.Texas-born actress Renée Zellweger plays the eponymous Bridget Jones, a desk-jockey in a plush London office belonging to a publishing firm. She is single; 32 years of age and desperate for a man in her life as yet another New Year's ticks by- bellowing out the lyrics to ""All by Myself"" after a day's slog, complete with all the drum and cymbal actions right on cue, to emphasise the point. Despite this, Jones is not lonely in the technical sense - she has a large group of contacts and acquaintances: her friends are an assortment of homosexuals and liberal metropolitans; her parents, played by Jim Broadbent and Gemma Jones, eventually become separate shoulders to cry on, while at the office, there is her boss Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant), to whom she takes a fancy.The film makes some effort to point out as to how Jones has been living life fairly liberally: she smokes; falls drunk out of taxi cabs after nights out; has neglected her diet over the years and has placed a lot of effort and energy into her career in order to be where she is - there are not many people in jobs, after all, who might be able to rub shoulders with both Salman Rushdie AND Jeffery Archer at a function. Much later on in the film, there is a scene involving Jones having to do some actual cooking from original ingredients - the likes of which comes as totally alien to her, inferring a complete lack of skill in this department. This is something which would not have been the case for her previous generation, the likes of whom kept the homestead.The film depicts Jones seemingly want to break from most of this, and has her set about tidying up her life through a manner of ways which predominantly revolve around shedding her liberal skin - depicting the events amusingly in the titular diary, with her optimum goal being the obtaining of a man. Working with books for all her life, she is therefore afforded a degree of comedic prose with which to construct her entries.There are two men in her life who have the greatest potential of filling her life's largest chasm: one of them, and despite having already identified him as being somebody who embodies all that's wrong with men, is Cleaver. The other is a barrister and an old family friend played by Colin Firth called Mark Darcy, whose good looks the film feels need confirming to us early on by two women during a private conversation and whose paddling pool Jones happened to play around naked in when they were eight. Playfully, the film affords Cleaver and Darcy an antagonistic history in that one once slept with the other's fiancé.I was struck by just how passionate the film feels about its central message, that of how men and women are happier together and that love, it would seem, conquers all. At the time of the film being made, female employment actually outnumbered male employment in the United Kingdom for the first time in history. Feminism had found a happy place in society, allowing women to possess their own freedoms and careers - free from feeling ashamed about their bodies and allowing them to have relationships with co-workers on top of whatever else.
 
I'm not sure the film is necessarily taking a stand against much of this, and in its heroine, it has somebody who embodies these philosophies better than most, but it treads dangerously close to a line the other side of which commends monogamy; married life and things like pride in appearance: items which you might say are/were anathema to many of those who helped Labour to their landslide win at around the exact same time the source material for this film was conceived.Certainly, by the end, the film has depicted more than just Bridget Jones turning her life around: Jones' mother, in actual fact, goes in the opposite direction - describing herself as living in the ""winter"" of her life and admitting that, if she'd had a second chance, would not have even bothered with having children. Being more liberal in old age, she leaves her husband for another man. There is even room for an otherwise irrelevant narrative about a Kurdish man who escapes illegal deportation and thanks the heavens he has had a wife by his side all this time. The manner about which these supporting strands eventually unfold only seem to serve to reinforce my belief that the film is about how human beings do better as twosomes.Aside all things, the film is often just terrifically funny: moments such as the montage of job interviews Jones undergoes cannot help but make you laugh, whereas her desperate attempt to provide a speech at a book launch with the equipment not fully functional works on more than just the singular level. From the point of view of straight up genre film-making, the film ticks enough boxes. ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" has spawned two sequels, neither of which I have seen, but will certainly hunt down - I would recommend this particular entry besides.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Skip this film.,"This was shown as an in-flight movie and its a good thing too, otherwise I would have walked out on it. Renée Zellweger's accent is grating to listen to and the story is very weak. Although I like Renée Zellweger in other films I have seen, she is horrible in this story. The film has no contrast because there are few frames of the film that Renée Zellweger doesn't appear in. The truly milk-toast matter in which her character is presented is insulting to her acting talents. I think too much focus on the fact she beefed up for the role was about the only thing done right for the film. I feel the hype about her weight gain was to compare her efforts to Robert De Niro as he did in Raging Bull. This is no classic.",,Anonymous,Romance
Cringe-porn that isn't very funny,"Movies are often made with an audience in mind. ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" was not made for the American male college students of the world. Us American male college students can enjoy movies like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""Animal House"", which were both made to play with our greatest dreams. Bridget Jones's Diary had middle-aged UK women in mind, and it's hard to imagine one would like this movie if he or she did not fit that exact profile.Bridget Jones's Diary is the story of a single woman who doesn't want to be single anymore. Two suitors fight for her hand.What really killed this movie was the character of Bridget Jones herself. The woman is not functional. In everything she does, Jones is cartoonishly inept. This ineptitude quickly stops being cute and becomes totally insufferable for the viewer. All of the movie's humor comes from Jones finding a way to embarrass herself. Sometimes she gives an awkward speech at a public event, sometimes she accidentally offends her friends and coworkers, et cetera. This constant use of cringe humor is lazy and unfunny.Why are there two men fighting over this woman? Both men are handsome and very successful in their work. These might even be considered ""dream guys."" Firth's character is handsome, rich, and a pseudo-famous lawyer. What does he see in Jones, a woman who constantly offends him and makes a fool of herself? Who knows.

Lots of fun,"The story is predictable and contains the usual romantic-comedy cliches--especially towards the end--but the movie is so sweet, funny and charming that I had a smile on my face throughout.  Renee Zelwegger was perfect in the lead role, and perfected the English accent, never making it seem forced.  Hugh Grant, for once, gets to play a sleazy, womanizing, villainous character and it was a nice change of pace.  I've always liked Hugh, he's a terrific comic actor with great timing (and I love his uncomfortable facial expressions during comic scenes), and he was just as much fun to watch in this movie as he was in ""Notting Hill"" and ""Mickey Blue Eyes.""  There are a lot of big laughs, and the film has a great message about accepting others for who they are, Bridget herself being a slightly overweight woman who's overly jolly and seems to never come up with the right thing to say.

Unique way to happiness,"Bridget Jones is a compelling and funny movie. According to the original book which was written as a diary of Bridget's inner thoughts. This story is not poignant drama, it's not about first love or when someone is dying of incurable disease or struggling with drug addiction. It's ordinary and hackneyed story with cliched plot about problems of women trying to draw attention of a man. But why exactly this movie is so lauded? Bridget Jones is in her early thirties, smokes too much, drinks too much, thinks she is overweight and also does foolish things, like getting drunk and having an affair with her boss. Finally she is macabre at cooking. Maybe because Bridget is a very likeable and memorable character, and everyone can easily identify with her problems. She has a friends and parents who always tell her that she must gets married and has children before she gets too old.

Baffled by it's popularity,"I will never understand why so many people rave about this movie. I found it annoying and boring to the extreme. Neither the plot or the acting kept my interest - I ended up finishing the movie by sheer force of will. Renee Zellweger did absolutely nothing to endear me to her character. This movie single handedly ended any appreciation I had for her work - I now avoid movies that have her in it. Bridget is more annoying than anything else. Not to mention that ""fat"" Bridget is not that fat at all - the majority of women these days wouldn't look half so good in that bunny suit. For all the glorifying praise Renee got for gaining weight, there really wasn't anything to write home about. Frumpy clothing does not make someone fat. I actually think she looked better in BJD than she did in her wedding pictures. While I love Colin Firth and ""Pride and Prejudice"", I found his character boring and uninspired. I suppose he probably was bored and uninspired, considering this is exactly the type of role Colin keeps getting thrown into.I understand that the book (which I haven't read) was based on ""Pride and Prejudice"", but the movie turned out as such a blatant knock off of P&P that it probably would have made more sense to acknowledge the inspiration in the previews.

What a surprise.We are supposed to perceive of 30-something Bridget Jones (Renee Z.) as a sympathetic character; (the audiences are predominantly female, and presumably are commiserating).  What I saw instead was a foul mouthed lout and obtuse loser who, despite promises to the eponymous diary, made no real effort to address the deficiencies she herself fully recognized.Working at a publishing house in London, she responds to the lewd e-mailed suggestions of her boss, played by Hugh Grant (the caddish snake with a proper British accent is a slight variation on his usual character, but one he does well).  Although she seems to know he is up to no good, she happily proceeds, merely setting herself up for humiliation and disappointment (the two common occurrences which provide the ""humor"" of this movie).  The alternative with whom she is presented is a stodgy (divorced) lawyer whom she ostensibly knew as a child, but seems to have been raised in a manor house on an estate some distance away, contradicting a central theme of the story, which is that (according to her mother who is trying to set them up) she romped naked as a four year old in his wading pool (he was eight at the time).The representation of middle class life in London for a young single person is interesting, as it was in ""Notting Hill"", but it was also noteworthy that the two significant incidences of potential calamity had their origins in ""New York"" (interestingly the home office not only of her publishing firm, but of the lawyer's firm as well).Most people have some vices, bad habits or other imperfections.  Bridget has these, but precious little else.  Her troubles are those caused solely by herself and her actions (or inactions).  The story laboriously drags itself to its clearly telegraphed ""happy"" conclusion, but we are left wondering, why?Midway through the movie, after cataloging a list of faults, the lawyer and potential suiter somewhat inexplicably states ""... but I like you"". That's more than I can say for Bridget, or the movie.  If your girlfriend (or date) insists, then go, but otherwise stay away!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good Performances, Middling Direction","The good stuff:Renee Z: Pitch perfect as Bridget. A performance without ego, winning every moment she's on-screen (in other words, the whole movie).Hugh Grant: His best role for years. Not the stuttering, bumbling sweetie, but a deliciously slimy cad.Colin Firth: My wife finally sees why women are nuts about him. Wonderful counterpoint to Grant, their jousting was fun and provided some nice edginess.And now the problems...the movie lost it about the halfway mark. The ""diary"" structure which worked so well for the first section was abandoned altogether and it became a more ""conventional"" romantic comedy. Also, England was shown as either dusted with snow or in bright sunshine (where's the rain, lads?) everyone (except Bridget) has homes worthy of millionaires and the ""supporting friends"" roles (well written by Richard Curtis in 4 Weddings and Notting Hill) are woefully sketchy and incomplete. The fight between Grant and Firth is ludicrous and out of place.So, I was looking for at least a 9 (after half an hour) but in the end 7/10 will about do it. Bring Renee back to London for ""The Edge of Reason"", please!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
What I liked About This Movie...,"...is what some people may not have liked about this movie. Firstly, compared to the way Renee Z normally looks, she is overweight. And, the fact that her character is far from perfect, saying and doing inappropriate things at the wrong times helps us to relate to her. She is a regular person; who has not put their foot in their mouth from time to time? Or did something totally embarrassing? Everyone should be able to relate to her.Her character is non-pretentious which is part of her appeal. Bridget is fun loving, genuine, honest and funny. She is not unlike most of us, looking for love while we sometimes trudge through the mundane everydayness of life. Well cast and acted, a little corny at times, but fun!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Bridget Owes Benny!,"'Bridget Jones' struck a chord with millions of single women all over the world. She's kooky, blonde, has a weight problem, a man problem, and is British. If she were the creation of a man, she'd have been banned by now.I loved the moment in this film when Bridget slides down a fireman's pole and we see her big knickers close up. But then I laughed at the same gag when it was done on 'The Benny Hill Show' on 23/12/70.This is supposed to be feminist comedy, yet when its only memorable gag comes from an old television show derided and pilloried for its so-called 'sexism', you know something is wrong somewhere.Benny Hill, rest in peace.Your legacy is intact. Renee Zellweger is your natural heir.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
I didn't expect it to be as good as it turned out to be.,"This film is perhaps one of the most iconic romantic comedies of the last thirty years. It's very fun, engaging, and the main character, with her blunders and confusions, ends up deserving our sympathy, a factor that makes us wish that everything ends well for her. Of course, with the film being a light and humorous comedy, the happy ending is almost a certainty.Directed by Sharon Maguire, the film is based on a book that is indirectly inspired by the novel ""Pride and Prejudice"", by Jane Austen. The story revolves around Bridget Jones, a thirty-year-old women who are still single and decides, on New Year's Eve, to quit smoking, lose weight and find a boyfriend. Of course, her talent for arranging troubles and minor disasters promises to greatly derail those plans, but she quickly finds herself torn between two very different men: Mark Darcy, Jones' mother's favorite, a wealthy family lawyer recently divorced and, on the other hand, her own boss, Daniel Clever, a womanizing, hedonistic and self-centered editor.For me, the best thing about this film is the perceptible feeling that it seeks to please a wider audience, and be included in the list of family films, rather than being a film focused on women and aimed at female audiences. The film isn't ultra-sentimental, it's not as hyped up or histrionic as some publicity had me think, and the main character isn't as dumb as I thought she would be. That said, yes, it surprised me on the positive side, and it was much better than I imagined it to be. In fact, despite recognizing the film's impact, mainly on popular culture (with several scenes becoming famous even for which, like me, had never seen the film), I just gave it a chance now, because it felt like a movie I wouldn't like to see. Thankfully, I was wrong... even so, the film is not perfect: there is a certain obsession with marriage here that I find reprehensible, as if someone's happiness depended on not being single, or it was not possible to be happy alone.Renee Zellwegger gets, with this film, one of the defining works of her career as an actress, as it earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Actress and remained in people's memories. She has really done an excellent job and deserves to be commended for it, and particularly for the way she has mastered the British accent and the native English way of being. If I didn't know the actress, I would say she is one hundred percent English. Colin Firth also shone in her role. Being an actor I'm used to seeing in characters that ask for an additional dose of charm, dignity or chivalry, and having already played Darcy in ""Pride and Prejudice"", he was a natural choice. I like Hugh Grant, he has his usual charm, but he can't seem to be a capable villain as he doesn't seem nasty enough. Last but not least, the excellent contribution of Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent (who would receive an Oscar that year for another work).Technically, this film proudly lives, breathes, speaks and claims to be British. With contained production values, it presents us with an elegant cinematography, full of charm, but without artifice or great visual games, as is the hallmark of good British cinema, where light and color, a reliable camera work and editing and a good choice of filming locations guarantees almost half the visuals. The film bets well on creating a funny, light mood without letting itself relax too much. The costumes are an important part of the film, and the way they help to define characters is something to be aware of (Darcy's tasteful and expensive suits, Bridget's tight skirts, the anthological scene of her disguised as a bunny etc.). The film also has a very effective soundtrack, with several well-known songs that easily stays in our memories.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good for a laugh.,Whenever I'm feeling miserable this is my go to movie as poor Bridget just makes me laugh when she's in the most awkward of situations and you can't help but feel better about yourself.,7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Perfectly Charming Tale of the Average Woman,"Year 2001, a heroine entered theaters whom women could identify with. A woman with insecurities over her looks and weight, over drinking and smoking her life away, and not being able to find and hold onto the right guy. And that right there played into all the insecurities every woman on the face of the planet faces everyday. Who is this woman? Why, Bridget Jones, a 32 year old British woman living in London! Normally, a character in Bridget's position would in a typical movie be the supporting player, the one off to the side with the sub plot and the witty one liners, becoming very two dimensional and stereotypical. Yet with this film, that stereotype is given prominence, and how wonderfully it succeeds! Depressed over the comment Mark Darcy made about her (He called her a spinster) at her parent's annual Christmas party, Bridget decides to finally take control of her life, to cut back on drinking and smoking, to lose weight, and to find a nice man to make her happy. To keep track of all this, she decides to keep a journal.Renee Zellweger was perfectly charming in this film, creating Bridget Jones into a sweet, adorable, likable character that was very easy to relate to. People thought Renee wouldn't be able to convincingly pull off her British accent, but watching the film you sometimes forget that she is actually American. Renee was able to convey the stress of keeping her spirits up after discovering that her boss was cheating on her, and slowly discovering that her perfect man had been in front of her all along. Her Oscar nomination was absolutely deserved.Colin Firth was amazing in his role of Mark Darcy. Though he really does not say much throughout the film, you could always tell what he is feeling just by looking at his eyes. They convey so many words that Firth could have been silent the whole film and you would be able to understand him perfectly. But it is wonderful that he does speak, for the speech he gives to Bridget about ""Liking her just the way she is"" was so sweetly put, it makes you long for someone to say those words to you.Hugh Grant, who before this was type cast as the dorky-sweet romantic lead, breaks from this with his role as Daniel Cleaver. Hugh Grant is one of those actors who brings so much more to the role that you could ever expect, and with this character, Grant does not disappoint. Hr plays the wanker down to a T, is convincingly caddy, and the playboy everyone wants but knows will be in trouble if they have him. Not to mention, watching Cleaver and Darcy fight near the end of the film will have you rolling in the aisles!Bridget Jones's Diary. Probably considered a total chick flick, but has a wonderful theme: Being yourself is all you'll ever need, and accepting yourself for who and what you are will lead you to happiness.Highly recommended.MJR",,Anonymous,Romance

Phony,"Renee Zellweger's ludicrous British accent is only one of the outrages perpetrated in Sharon Maguire's film of the Helen Fielding bestseller about the life and loves of a thirty-something single woman. This is a film that could set the feminist cause back thirty years with its shamelessly aggressive belief that women have careers only to make themselves more available to men and that life isn't worth living if Mr. Right doesn't come along. Zellweger spends the entire film trying to convince us she's got the accent down but she's only a caricature--and a blank one at that. Maguire, meanwhile, spends just as much effort trying to convince us that a natural beauty like Zellweger is fat and plain--it's a sham (much like Janeane Garafolo is in `The Truth About Cats & Dogs'). The rest of the cast is uninspired; even the dependable Hugh Grant, trying to play against type as a cad, barely registers a pulse and Colin Firth, as Mr. Right, is curiously unlikable. The script (by Fielding and two other-male-writers) is shallow and tedious.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Brilliant film!,"Bridget Jones is not only one of the best date films of all time, it-s a work of art. To tell you the truth, it's better than most of the chick flicks I often watch with my girlfriend. I've read the book so I know the plot {again, many scenes have been omitted and others, like the fight scene, added in to give the movie some feel}.The movie is about a modern-day young woman living in London... actually, about a woman in her early 30s... with no serious relationship, unmarried, overweight-- her weight often resembles that of a man's--, and someone who simply spits out whatever she thinks about, regardless of the consequences. But this year is the year in which she finally experiences love, and also ends up in a dilemma: She must chose between her charming boss {superb performance by Hugh Grant}, and the far more reserved barrister Mark Darcy {Colin Firth give an equally great performance}.Although I'm disappointed by the fact that many scenes have been omitted from the book-- those who didn't read the book I shan't reveal them--, This is nevertheless a movie with a great plot, performances and charm.All of the three leads steal the show in his/her own way. Zellweger--being an American-- seemed an unlikely bird to play a typically British character, but She makes it very believable that those who never heard-- I knew from watching JERRY MAGUIRE years before-- of her thought she was a Brit herself. I couldn't imagine anyone playing Bridget, not even Winslet, who was one of the leading bets-- who almost got the part but was dropped because she was too young, 24 at the time, for the role--. Hugh Grant gives charisma to the naughty Daniel Cleaver, and sidesteps his usual characters. Colin Firth gives a comeback to familiar ground-- I remember watching PRIDE and PREJUDICE in 1995, in which he became a star in the UK-- as the solicitor Mark Darcy with no problems at all.For anyone who plans to strike a relationship or is in one already, this a perfect film to put and it is More than just a ""date movie"" or ""chick flick"". TO end it, it is by far one of my favourite films that is amusing all the way.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"t is a truth universally acknowledged that when one part of your life starts going okay, another falls spectacularly to pieces.","How would Bridget Jones write this in her diary about her life? This film is a cute, comedic unrealistic commentary on women in their thirties like Bridget Jones played beautifully by Texas American Renee Zellwegger. A role that could have been done by any British actress striving for her big break has been done by one of Hollywood's brightest rising stars. Renee can sure play British and she also plays Beatrix Potter. THe casting choice of her to play this very British role might be shocking but she manages to do this role without being Meryl Streep and being more a talent to watch out for. Bridget's parents are played by the underrated Gemma JOnes and Oscar Winner Jim Broadbent. Colin Firth and Hugh Grant play the men who seek to win Bridget's heart. Firth plays Darcy here and in the 1995 Pride and Prejudice television mini-series and Hugh Grant is famous for playing the lovable loser at love. The film was filmed mostly in London and England. Although you can't stand in any airport for JFK in New York City. Any way, the film is a lot of fun to watch and should be shown over the Christmas holiday season.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

boring,"BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY creates a world where sex, dating, and emotions are like a CD you broke.  Yeah, it sucks it's in three pieces but you can always get a new one at the store.  This kind of attitude in filmmaking creates a relaxed atmosphere for the audience and allows us to see society like a circus as opposed to acknowledging it as anything real.  SEX AND THE CITY carries the same objective and makes the trendy singles scene look fun, happening, and intriguing.  Unfortunately, if a filmmaker's goal is to obtain a recognition of truth, BRIDGET JONES and its cousin fall far off. Although casted well and executed in a cute summer reading fashion, the movie continuously catapults us into English bar set ups, where each member drinks heavily in order to create a comic event.  Therefore, when the director tries to create a poignant scene with sustinence, it takes off to what Keith Moon would refer to a lead zeppelin.",,Anonymous,Romance

And, of course, both use the song ""Someone Like You"" at the end!  But Bridget Jones is a real film and Someone Like You a TV movie reject someone got Ashley Judd to star in.

Though missed out on by many critics at the time, and dismissed as merely light entertainment, like a vintage 1968 châteauneuf du pape , this film, and indeed its excellent samples, have only improved with time and maturity.

But after having seen this movie I must say i've started to doubt this preference..OK, so there are some funny developments, and I find Hugh Grant a rather amusing character, esp. when he has this immoral streak going on.. nevertheless, the development was predictable, the characters were rather stereotypical, dialogues where very very ... dull.. and the soundtrack was without exception the most horrible sequence of pep-tunes i have EVER heard..yeh, i cant stress that enough: the soundtrack of this movie is horrible.. and since background music is able to make or break a scene, this might explain why scenes just lacked ambiance.. I actually had to turn of the sound to be able to keep watching certain scenes.. (now that cant be a good thing).. I don't know any names so i cant give examples, but rest assure that with its peppy and almost desperate selection of songs it stands out from any other romantic comedy in the most negative way.. it doesn't 'blend' the scenes.About acting; other than Hugh Grant (who is actually a bit over the top) i find other characters very unconvincing and 'propish' (which includes this movie's good guy).. esp the 3 friends of Bridget, hanging around her throughout the movie as a soundboard for her romantic developments, really feel like being put there as filling.. plus they are annoying..

Couldn't get past all the smoke,"I don't smoke but I have nothing against smoking.  But what did it help the movie by having every single character smoking 24-7?

Compromises don't come much finer than this,"I sat down to watch this film certain that it would be a horrid compromise of British humour and US influenced shmaltz.  The casting of Renne Zellweger over the likes of Minnie Driver aggravated me.  There's just no *need* for it.  And the news that Renee had the same voice coach as Gwyneth Paltrow filled me with horror.  Paltrow's English accent is very credible Standard English.  The only trouble is, nobody except newsreaders speaks Standard English.  Everyone - *everyone* - in the UK speaks a recognisable dialect.And initially, Renee struck me as similar.  Her accent is Standard English, except where it verges into generic over-rounded ""posh"".  It's not a dialect, and it rings just a little false.  Oh well, I thought, here we go. At least it's not Dick Van Dyke.But to my delight, five minutes into the film, I'd (nearly) gotten over it. Because Renee *is* Bridget Jones.  She looks perfect, and her mannerisms are flawless.  I was won over, and quite in love, and considering that Bridget is actually not a sympathetic character, that's quite a feat.And from there it was plain sailing, because the rest of the cast acted as though the roles were written for them.  Colin Firth's role *was* written for him (in the original columns and book) in fact, and Hugh Grant's might as well have been.  The support were equally as comfortable and recognisable, with only a couple of exceptions: Cosmo, who should have been more Tim Nice-But-Dim (British reference, but it's a British film) and Julian, who, to be fair was playing one of the few characters that had been changed significantly from the book.Highlights were the scenes that were recognisable re-workings of the 1995 BBC miniseries of ""Pride and Prejudice"", lowlights were the slightly kludged ending that actually veers away from the Diary (and Austin) original, and the couple of Americanised scenes.All in all, a splendid adaptation and a splendid film in its own right.  The big outstanding question is: if they film the sequel, which features an interview with Colin Firth, who will they cast to play him?  Enquiring minds want to know. ;-)",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Really Poor,"""Bridget Jones's Diary"" is a film that I had been aware of and I had heard that it was great, but after finally seeing it I am surprised by just how bad it was. I really did not like it but kept watching anyway because it was like some trainwreck that you can't not look at. First off, there was too much smoking, drinking, and swearing; I don't mind some, but it just felt wanton and excessive. There was also ridiculous sexual harassment in the workplace which I was shocked was happening at first; I thought I misinterpreted what was happening, like it was a dream or something. None of the characters show any growth; they all just seem to be looking for someone to use. Not a very romantic film and one which I was glad when it was over. My rating 3/10. And while Renee's accent was ok, I'd still prefer to see an Englishwoman in the role; it makes no sense.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Stay away from this movie.  You have been warned.,"This movie is so bad it is shocking. Renee Zellweger prattles on with what has to be one of the phoniest British accents ever in movie history in this vapid, mind numbing story. But what is worse is the character she plays - an annoying, simpering, pouting, insecure, overweight woman whose sole preoccupation is trying to keep relationships with men who obviously do not care about her and should have absolutely nothing to do with her. The character is so unattractive, indeed abrasive, that there should be no surprise that she has problems maintaining relationships. But Ms. Zellweger's horrible, phony British accent is just too much to bear. The producer of this movie couldn't find an English woman to play Bridgit Jones? They had to hire an American actress? Why not have Brad Pitt play Hugh Grant's character? If you like movies which feature American actors playing unattractive, piggish-looking people, then this movie is for you. Otherwise, stay away!

Grant and Firth as bumbling Englishmen. I never!,"Early century British 'rom-com'. This film epitomises the whole genre that was so successful at the turn of the century. Usually produced by a company such as Working Title and starring as one of the lead actors Hugh Grant as a bumbling Englishman. The star actress was unknown upon release Rene Zellwegger as thirty something singleton Miss. Bridget Jones who happened to keep a diary of her muddled private life. A private life that is the subject of the film.Poor Bridget. She is a bit dipsy and has an interesting private life that revolves around her family, her boss (Grant as lethario Daniel Cleaver) and family friend Mark D'Arcy (Colin Firth). Cleaver and D'Arcy also have a bit of history as....oh its to complicated! The film boasts some excellent cameo appearances by the most unlikeliest people from a disgraced ex-Conservative peer Lord Archer to Salman Rushdie and Honor Blackman.The film has a feel good soundtrack to balance moments such as an appalling but hilarious fist fight sequence. Some memorable one liners and verses are included. The film spawned two sequels due to its box-office success. Working Title meanwhile have moved away from Hugh Grant starring rom-coms to classics such as Fifty Shades Of Grey! I last saw Grant as a bumbling Englishman still in The Man From U. N. C. L. E.

Just plain funny.,"I admit, it was maybe around the time when this movie was released here in my country then, it was the Hugh Grant and the Colin Firth factor which made me secretly wish I could go watch the movie. I don't know, it was just like that. Suddenly thinking the British guys can be uh, handsome.Five years on, I managed to catch it on cable.Adapted from Helen Fielding's novel, it's about the main protagonist Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) trying to set things right on a new year by writing whatever she wants to say in her diary. In her 30s and still a single and a little kind of plump, she is determined to get a man in her life. The movie began with Bridget who went to attend a party and she met her former childhood friend who is now a lawyer Mark Darcy (Colin Firth). Mark had been divorced with his wife and is single again.But on the other hand, Bridget's boss in the publishing company she works for, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) started to become interested in her. Bridget found out later that her boss and childhood friend actually knew each other back in their university days. And the two guys never seemed to be on a good terms even before Bridget is in the middle of them.It was made worse when Mark and Daniel realise they both like Bridget. Though Bridget found out once that Daniel had a girlfriend, Daniel told her they had broken up. And he told her that during her birthday. It was complicated to Bridget that Mark had did expressed his feelings to Bridget before Daniel came for the birthday party.Well, who ended up had the girl in the end? The childhood friend or the boss?Overall, I managed to catch the accents and I have to say Renee Zellweger did pretty a decent job in having a British accent for her role as Bridget to match with her fellow cast members. Definitely one movie which is just plain funny.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Big Ass, Bunny suit, hahahahahahahahahahahaha","A fairly expensive version of a tacky, crude, vulgar birthday card that has a catchy theme when you open it.

The kind of film watched by teenagers kneeling two feet from the TV set, a box of tissues next too them, their pants at their ankles, remote in hand, masturbating while re watching the same 10 seconds of suggestive soft porn, looking over their shoulders every couple of minutes checking their parents haven't come back from their dinner party. The sad fact is i can imagine that it is actually an accurate representation of some peoples lives (which is why i gave it a 2 instead of a 1). Watch it therefore only as a cautionary tale, or if the parents are out and your looking for some obeisant kicks.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Loved the film right from the very start,"Bridget Jone's Diary definitely ranks top on the list of romantic comedies I have watched. It is a hilarious adaptation of the ""Pride and Prejudice"" romance. I can't think of anything I found irksome about the film, just can't find a downside considering the genre it belongs to. This film has introduced me to the charm of Colin Firth and I'm glad about that. Renee Zelwegger did wonders and seemed every bit British. Kudos to Grant too for playing a scoundrel type role, not something he usually essays. Although the movie's basic plot is predictable (this is intentional or else Colin Firth's character wouldn't have been named Darcy) pretty much from the start, the same cannot be said for the film's scene or dialogue. Not surprised that this film has been directed by a woman, Sharon Maguire, because the film captures the nitty-gritty aspects of a woman's life.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Memories of old, great movies","This movie reminds me of the wonderful movies of the 1940's, though, this one is somewhat more complicated and definitely more adult (but, who makes love with their bra on, in real life?).

The scenes were beautiful; the acting made me teary at times and at many other times were so funny.

Richard Curtis woz here,"I read the book - loved it - but the film is unfortunately a cringefest. RZ does her best, but what's with the posh accent, a la Gwyneth Paltrow in Sliding Doors?

Hugh Grant is great - makes a change from his usual bumbling foppishness, and really well cast.I have added this film to a list that includes Match Point, Sliding Doors and any of Richard Curtis' films - namely - awful, but so bad, they are worth watching just for the unintentional comedy.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Refreshingly funny romantic comedy.,"I have never read the book that this film is adapted from but if it's as good as the film I'd rush out and buy it. I was wary of seeing this film to begin with because of all the hype prior to its release. I thought that (as has happened with many other films in the past) it would not live up to expectations.   The first thing that put me off watching was the choice of Texan Renee Zellweger to portray the very British Bridget. I thought the film would be ruined by another American actor failing miserably at attempting the British accent, however I was wrong. She sounded totally authentic. Also her acting was fantastic as a desperate, lonely thirty-something single woman. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth were also brilliant.  It's great to see Hugh Grant in a change of character. It shows what a talented actor he is, easily making the transition from his usual role of nice guy to the smug womaniser he plays in this. What I loved though was how realistic it was. I'm sure many women cringed as they saw something embarrassing happen to Bridget and remember when they were in a similar situation.   Usually while watching so called 'chick flicks' you hear a great response from the women in the audience but the men look half asleep. This was not the case as I watched this film. The men found it just as hilarious.Don't miss it!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Lighthearted humorous chick-flick about an insecure woman searching for love between a smileless man and a philanderer,"Bridget Jones's Diary is what I call a bona fide chick-flick. This means the story is told from a woman's perspective and deals with matters that matter to women. In this case, Bridget (played by Renée Zellweger) is a 32 year old slightly-insecure single woman who, after numerous failed match-making attempts, decides to find a suitable partner as part of her New Year's resolutions. She is introduced to an old family friend, divorced Mark Darcy (played by Colin Firth) who initially comes off as cold and angry. Around the same time, she is seduced by her misogynistic amorous boss Daniel (played by Hugh Grant). Drama ensures between the two men as they fight for the attention and affections of this one girl.This movie does not try to be a serious drama or romantic movie. Far from it, this movie is more of a comedy revolving around the themes of love and romance from a girl's point of view. Bridget appears to be self-conscious about herself and her weight yet at the same time has a tendency to speak before she thinks. This leads her to a number of humorous situations throughout the movie. This movie deals with the themes of finding a life partner, dinner parties, new year's resolutions and relationships.Unfortunately, there were aspects of this movie which I did not enjoy. The first is the casual normalization of misogynistic sexual harassment behaviors such as regular ass groping and sending sexually offensive emails. These things are not tolerated in real-life. However, both of these are tolerated by the leading lady of this film without any repercussions to the men involved at all. The second is the regular amount of swearing in the movie. I understand the characters are portraying people from the UK, but swearing is a choice. And a choice can be chosen for people to express themselves without swearing at all. It is unfortunate that movies in popular culture such as Bridget Jones's Diary can influence and affect the minds of people in society of what they deem to be acceptable and normal. The normalization of swearing and adultery in society is something I personally do not prefer.Furthermore, I did not find the movie to be realistic at all but rather it comes off as manufactured and artificially constructed. The way I would describe it is imagine you had a cheap woman's erotic novel that was turned into a movie. The acting feels somewhat campy and hammy. The script feels more like a manufactured stage play on the big screen rather than an immersive realistic slice-of-life drama.Do the positives outweigh the negatives of this movie? If you come in with an open-mind and not expecting to watch a serious movie at all then perhaps so. This film will appeal especially to single people in their late 20s or 30s and beyond who can relate to the themes of this movie as they search for a partner themselves.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bridget Jones v. charming,"The film version of Bridget Jones Diary is one to applaud.  Although some instances were excluded, the film is just as charming and remarkable as the book.  Zellweger is an enchanting Bridget Jones and just as Bridget's character is funny and lovable, so is Zellweger's performance.  Firth and Grant put in v. good performances as Darcy and Cleaver as they are both amusing and suave in their roles.  Even the music throughout the movie played a vital part in the film's explanation of Bridget's mood and feelings.  You'll laugh, cry, and sigh throughout the film as you see Bridget's foibles and love dealings.  You may even be surprised at how the film proceeds to share Bridget's experience.

Fantasy Island,"Want to know what its like to live in England? Ask Richard Curtis. Hes always on hand to paint a picture of London life as imagined stateside - a London where everyone is middle class, has eccentric friends who are frightfully naughty because they swear a bit - where the ever so slightly repressed English handle sex with a mixture of crude embarrassment and the odd 'outrageous' outburst and a London in which it always snows at Christmas. If reality was half this middle of the road we might all kill ourselves with two and half big neurofens to a large glass of Chardonnay but thankfully this version of my fair city only exists in the mind of the Chelsea set and the Oxbridge media cult. Women love Bridget Jones of course, shes one of them you see. She worries about being fat, drinks too much, gets screwed over by men all the time (they ARE bastards aren't they?) and is prone to getting squiffy and making a fool of herself. A comfortable caricature for a lot of people I'm sure and lets be honest, if you identify with Bridget then its odds on that you've never held an original thought in your life. I'll bet you drink Pinot Grigo at pubs, are currently on a fad diet, have a fitness video hosted by an ex-Big Brother contestant and read Heat magazine. OK, you may say, what's wrong with a light bit of fairytale entertainment? Well nothing except that it seems to be the only kind of national representation that has any hope of being made these days and it gets on my bloody nerves. Also, would it be possible for an English lead to be played by, wait for it, an Englishwoman? Its bad enough that we've got to watch ourselves being parodied but surely to God we don't have to be impersonated as well? Incidentally, and I don't wish to offend anyone...which obviously isn't true but stick with it, there's nothing remotely funny about being the sort of Cosmo reading, ever so slightly kooky girl depicted here - if this is you, sit down and have a rethink tonight - life's too short to be a cliché.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

"The script is marvelous, Renée is terrific!","This is a very refreshing movie. The script is marvelous. It is extremely well written and each line is throughly tough and extremely funny.  I usually prefer to see movies when they come out on video because there is no one talking behind me or some really tall boy who comes to sit in front of me, but I love Renée Zellweger (One True Thing, Jerry Maguire, A Price Above Rubies), who is not just a beautiful person on the outside, she is beautiful on the inside as well. She is also a very good actress. Renée  has done some heavy duty acting with actors of the caliber of Meryl Streep, William Hurt, Jim Cary, Tom Cruise, just to name a few. She is wonderful in the part of Brigitt Jones. She is Brigitt Jones!!!!!!!!!! I hope she gets a nomination for this.  They tricked me because I thought she was going to stay with ""Daniel Cleaver,"" played by Hugh Grant (Notting Hill), but she does not. I am hoping they do a sequel, because I was reading that ""Bridget Jones : The Edge of Reason,"" is even funnier than ""Bridget Jones's Diary."" I think this movie is one of the best movies I have seen lately. It is funny without being canned. I think that Colin Firth (Shakespeare in Love) ,  Hugh Grant, all did a great job, specially Renée Zellweger's accent. There is a possibility that she learned British English at  home because both of her parents were born in Europe, and Europeans tend to have a British accent not and American accent in English. She also spent sometime in England studying the part. Favorites Scenes: Opening Scenes when Bridget  is singing along with a record. The fire station scene. Sending e-mail to Daniel Cleaver without showing any facial expression. Picking up which undies to wear. The whole movie is hilarious.

Zellweger shines as a quintessentially English girl,"This film is another excellent showcase for the talents of Rene Zellweger. It is a fairly common occurrence for British actors to play American characters with varying degrees of success in duplicating an American accent.  It is almost unheard of for an American to play a British character, and when it does happen the accent is almost always awful. Zellweger nails both the accent and the demeanor of the quintessential middle class English girl and is absolutely charming in the role.The screenplay is an adaptation of Helen Fielding's novel of the same name that follows the single life of everywoman Bridget through the trials and tribulations of being a singleton.  Fielding unabashedly admitted in interviews that the original story was borrowed from Jane Austen's `Pride and Prejudice', going so far as to name one of the main characters Darcy (Colin Firth), the identical name of the corresponding character in Austen's novel.  To complete the bizarre crossbreeding, Firth played Darcy in the BBC production of P&P just before being cast in this role.Fielding's screenplay is full of the ironic and droll humor that makes English comedy unique.  Bridget is written as such an adorable ditz that you can't help loving her, especially with Zellweger playing the role.  First time director Sharon Maguire does a bang up job of keeping the silliness moving at a rapid fire pace.Zellweger is perfect for this role and must be commended for expanding her horizons (in all senses of the word).  She packed a great deal of weight onto her normally svelte frame to properly depict Bridget's weight problem. She then boldly allowed herself to be photographed in various skimpy outfits where flab burst forth from every seam.  Even more important than her excellent English accent is her comic ability to make the most of every peculiar situation with matter-of-factness so natural it is hard to believe that she didn't grow up in England.Zellweger totally eclipses her male leads in energy, comedic ability and charm.  The normally likeable and bumbling Hugh Grant is sorely miscast as the jerk.  Grant's strength is his sincerity and his character doesn't possess any, leaving him adrift in his ability to interpret the role. Firth, who has excellent comedic and dramatic skills, is really wasted in a role that mostly sees him leering dourly at Bridget for two thirds of the film.  When he finally gets a chance to interact he is very good in a stuffy sort of way that is right for his character.This is a delightfully wacky comedy with a fabulous performance by Rene Zellweger.  I rated it an 8/10.  It is peppered with funny truisms about single life that make Bridget's plight one that is with which easy to identify.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"surprisingly good, went with low expectations, but laughed heartily and lengthily","This movie was surprisingly good.  I expected a full blown chick flick, with little entertainment and even less humour value.  However, within the first few minutes of the movie, I was not only enjoying myself but almost belly laughing at the well written and well acted film.  Moreover, the humour is not simply the plight of a single, aging woman, but rather how she makes a fool of herself and how her peers (and us, as the audience) laugh at her. She is treated like rubbish and we enjoy it.  Hugh Grant is great, very cool, very believe.  All in all an enjoyable evening.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bridget Jones' Diary contains the funniest food preparation/eating scene since Tom Jones!,"I must have the recipe for:  Blue Soup, Congealed Green Gunge aka Capperberry Gravy and the orange, ""...most incredible s***"" served at Bridget's birthday party.This is a delightful film from beginning to end.  Based on Jane Austin's Pride and Prejudice, this one alters some of the situations and characters without changing the central theme or the outcome at all!My only complaint is that, after seeing Colin Firth in a wet shirt in Pride and Prejudice, I would MUCH rather have seen HIM again in a wet shirt, (idea:  the Green Gunge explodes all over Mark Darcy's nice white shirt, AHHH, the possibilities), than Hugh Grant.The final 10 minuets of the film are worth the price of admission and/ or the price of the terrific DVD and it's marvelous documentary on how the film got made.The director's comment track is priceless as she practically drools when she says, ""Oh, Collin is SO sexy here...!""Rene Zellwegger (sp), is a warm, vulnerable, believable Bridget, and the always fabulous Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent make charming and fey parents.Hugh Grant is a fine Mr. Wickens character, full of insincerity and sexual aggression.Love Bridget's mad dash after Mr. Darcy, through the snow not quite dressed but determined not to flub-up again!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"sweet, funny, excellent performances","It's a standard Hollywood movie, but a clever script, Zellweger's performance, and an excellent supporting cast lifts this predictable story to a level well above most of the romantic comedies. Hugh Grant is perfectly cast as the devilish ""bad boy"", and Colin Firth is the only choice for the rather thankless role of reprising Mr. Darcy of ""Pride and Prejudice"" (he is a very good actor but in most American movies he plays a pompous and humorless jerk; at least here he is a generally sympathetic character). But as good as all of these actors are, it's Zellweger that carries the movie. Her performance is perfectly nuanced -- she's funny, adorable, and goofy, and manages to convey just enough pain during her character's misadventures to be touching, while still letting you laugh.It's an ideal date movie, and she's still as cute as a button with the extra weight she put on for the role.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A Successful Experience For Richard Curtis to Make a Masterpiece, Love Actually.","While I was watching the movie I thought the similarities and likeness of it with Love Actually which is one of the best Romance and Christmas movies of the 20th century.

Although it was based on 1996 novel of the same name which was based upon both Pride & Prejudice the novel and it's popular 1995 BBC adaption. Even tho I don't like Rom-com movies but I liked this one as I loved Love Actually.

There only a handful of chick flicks that are good, in my opinion. But ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" was different. It was very funny and very true about life. I felt like in some ways she was like a person I knew. Or could even relate too. Whenever you meet a guy that's too good to be true, you can't get your mind off of him.

I'm not so sure that her soulmate is Mark Darcy (hunky Colin Firth) but at least he is smart enough and wise enough to see the inner goodness, warmth, and sexiness of our heroine.  I hope he really does love her ""just the way she is"", because that is what she deserves.

"Come the f**k on, Bridget!","Colin Firth or Hugh Grant (one of them) said that everyone sort of raised an eyebrow when they announced that Renee Zellweger was going to play the part of Bridget Jones, but that she blew everyone away. Well, that was exactly how I reacted. She was perfect for the part, in my opinion. As for the film, it was sweet, romantic, and DAMN FUNNY! I always laugh when I watch it, and I've seen it about 10 times. Hugh Grant is a good snake, and Colin Firth is very charming, even though he's pretty stiff in this. The end--or maybe what happens in the credits--makes it impossible for you to leave the movie not smiling. The end also makes me happy. There are two awards it was nominated for that it should have won: Best Kiss in the MTV movie awards, and the Oscar for Zellweger. She was hilarious! I'm looking forward to the sequel, but it won't be very good if she doesn't end up with the guy she did from this movie.-------9/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
V.V.Good!,"OK before I start let me tell you something. I am only 13 (whoops I shouldnt have said that seeing as the movie is rated a 15! :)) and my opinion is not usually valued.

Renée Zellweger was excellent as Bridget,her accent,if maybe rather posh, was otherwise flawless and her performance was v. good. This is not one of those deep and meaningful movies that win 300 Oscars but it is pretty darn good and if there was a category at the Oscars for funniest romantic comedy, this would win hands down. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth both show that they can act but Renée is the star of the show. The jokes are genuinely laugh-out-loud funny and the best bit about this movie is that there are no boring bits in between. Usually movies have a good bit then half an hour of nothing before you get to the next good bit. But not this one. No its not the best in the world and it probably wont get that Oscar.

"Great, but not the classic everyone makes it out to be.","With the fourth movie coming out next month because of course, I have decided to binge through the franchise starting off with the original from 2001 and it was great.Positives for Bridget Jones's Diary (2001):
There is a certain charm to this movie that I definitely see appeal to the British fans. The Rom-Com formula is utilized well in this movie with all the tropes we love these movies for. Renee Zellweger does a great job as the main character and while it is weird to hear her talk with a British accent, she certainly makes it work for the movie. I also really enjoyed Colin Fitth and Hugh Grant as the two love interests for Bridget Jones and there are some great comedic moments including a fight between the two men that had me smiling. And finally, I like the ending to this movie and it was felt right.Negatives for Bridget Jones's Diary (2001):
The movie isn't the comedy classic people make it out to be. I have watched many British comedy movies and I've enjoyed a lot of them, this just isn't one of them.Overall, Bridget Jones's Diary (2001) is a charming British romantic comedy that I did have fun watching, but it did fall short of my expectations.

Colin Firth plays the role that was literally made for him. Add in top-drawer supporting performances and you have a wonderful, hilarious movie that had everyone laughing out loud for most of the movie. As a reader I have seen a lot of book-to-screen movies fail miserably, but BJD transferred very well. There were a few funny running jokes that didn't make it into the screenplay, but I hardly missed 'em.

Great for Jane Austen fans!,"Any Jane Austen fans out there who adored the A&E mini series of the great book ""Pride and Prejudice"" will adore Bridget Jones' Diary.  Although Renee Zellweger's accent leaves something to be desired in places, she does a decent job of portraying a Brit.  But, then, what can you expect? Honestly. Colin Firth (Mark Darcy) is, as usual, stunning in this movie.  He does a phenomenal job of taking Mr. Darcy out of the Jane Austen movie and snapping him forward almost two hundred years and making it realistic.  Granted, a lot of this is credit to the author of the book (and the screenwriters), but he really does a smashing job and it does help that he was in that original great production of ""Pride and Prejudice"".  Again, for any Jane Austen fans, you will greatly appreciate the wealth of random ""Jane Austen movie"" characters from other adaptations of her books: Gemma Jones, James Faulkner, Jim Broadbent, Embedth Davidtz, Hugh Grant (of course), and Colin Firth (of course)!  It's a great plug for the origination of this storyline.  And it really is a great modern adaptation of Jane Austen.  Not quite as inventive as ""Clueless"", but great nonetheless.  Props to Helen Fielding for her great novel, and as well to the screenwriters.  This is a movie I would recommend to almost anyone.  Although, I have heard the criticism that the female character is whiny and unintelligent and on a completely lower eschelon than Mark Darcy (from a man, of course), I would definitely say this is a movie for the woman who has always wanted that one unattainable man--as well as a movie for those who believe in true love and that it truly does conquer all...even drunken stupidity, clumsiness, and outright moronic behavior. This movie proves that attraction and connection honestly are the two most important things when it comes to how we choose a life-partner...and that they're not exactly something we can control...",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Though I was a little tenuous to see Zellweger pull off an English accent, after 5 minutes I was lost in her clever non-sequitors and embarrassing faux pas.  Colin Firth and Hugh Grant are both perfectly charming in the roles as Zellweger's would-be suitors.

It Will Make Your Day!,"Monday May 283:35 p.m.- I arrive at the Sunset Place Cinema. I make the usual `disney world space mountain' type line to purchase tickets. Finally, I buy movie tickets (using my 1994 student i.d.)  for the new british romantic-comedy `Bridget Jones's Diary.' Since I am a big fan of british comedies such as `Four Weddings and a Funeral' and `Notting Hill', I did have high expectations.4:40 p.m.- I sit down in the multiplex and start shouting all the answers to the movie trivia questions that are shown on the large screen before the previews start. Yes, I know my mind has an endless capacity for useless information!!4:53 p.m.- I view some previews to some upcoming summer films such as `Planet of the Apes' (which is the story of some of the girls that I have met when I have been really drunk and realize the morning after that the truth hurts) and `Legally Blonde'  (which is the story of some of the girls that have gone with me to watch the submarine races at a nearby beach).5:05 p.m.- I start watching a quite amusing little gem of a film in `Bridget Jones's Diary.' I first notice that Renee Zellweger was born to play this part; even though many critics felt that she would be unable to play the part british. Renee's british accent and acting was excellent.6:10 p.m.- I get a good feel about what the plot of the film is all about: a distress chain-smoking social-drinker chunky british single female determined to fight the right man, lose weight, and change her drinking and smoking habits by year's end.6: 40 p.m.- I get up to go to the bathroom to do #1. Yes I know! That is T.M.I. (too much information). Anyways, at this point I do realize that the movie had made me laugh from time to time. I also realize that Hugh Grant and Colin Firth also deliver some very effective performances as the men in Bridget Jones' life. Screenwriter Richard Curtis again proves why his writing always deserves curtain calls.7:00 p.m.- The movie ends. I was quite satisfied with `Bridget Jones's Diary', even though it is not in the same line of cinematic excellence as `Four Weddings' and `Notting Hill'.11:00 p.m.- I write this review for `Bridget Jones's Diary' and recommend to all moviegoers that this film has the `write' stuff!**** Good",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Just about the funniest romcom in a long, long time!","I absolutely adored this film. My first impression was how similiar in premise it is to Pride and Prejudice, indeed, it could have been sold as a modern reworking! Any little nigglings I had about Texan Renee Zellweger playing the very British Bridget Jones were completely dispelled with her kicking rendition of All By Myself in the opening minutes! She played Bridget to a tee, perfect accent, slightly chubby and conveying her scattershot, ditzy ways, but still managing to be totally adorable! Hugh Grant was great against type, playing basically a smarmy git! Colin Firth did less well however, he looked uncomfortable everytime he was on screen, but he still manages to smoulder and look moody as hell! His character is basically Pride&Prejudice's Mr. Darcy all over again, but it was a nice touch, as Colin Firth's portrayal of Darcy in the BBC's production of Pride&Prejudice made Bridget go weak at the knees in the book! Over all a superior comedy in every way. Forget Notting Hill and Four Weddings, this is in another league. It's sweet but not sickly and it does what most romantic comedies have failed to do before: make you laugh out loud. An adorable and utterly lovable film, a bit like it's ditzy heroine!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

But she was never through with men.  She just was just tired of meeting bad ones.And she hardly ever writes in her diary.

I thought she was great in Nurse Betty and she is even funnier in this movie.I just wish the ending would have been a little more original. But overall, this is a very entertaining movie.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Is this the Notting Hill for 2001?,"Another sweet-but-painful film labelled as comedy by the marketers, in the style of British films which started with Four Weddings and a Funeral and has continued quite nicely ever since. This is by no means as good as the best of them, but is quite watchable, and shows that Renee, like Gwynneth can do a credible British accent. Its funny how the real actress now resembles what her character calls a 'stick insect', which only shows she didnt take any hints from the screenplay. All the British leads are terrific, of course, and it makes for a experience that this male thought was eminently worthwhile.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A delightful, romantic movie","Bridget Jones is a woman who is tired of being lonely, tired of drinking and smoking too much, and who doesn't like her weight. She isn't picking the right men either.  She decides to start keeping a diary, so she can see where to improve her life.I really enjoyed this movie.  It was satisfying, very funny, and very sweet. It's a great movie for lovers of all ages.  The acting was terrific, Hugh and Colin were both BEAUTIFUL, and Renee is obviously going to be a very big star!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Funniest movie I've seen in years!,"Although I am usually disappointed when I see a movie after having read the book, I have to say that Bridget Jones' Diary is one of those rare exceptions.  Renee Zellweger does a bang up job of playing Bridget, Hugh Grant is perfect as the sexy bad boy Daniel Cleaver, and of course, Colin Firth is sex on a stick (even when wearing a Rudolph jumper).For those who've read both books, the casting of Colin Firth creates something of a crisis if they ever decide to film a ""BJD 2"", but he's so absolutely perfect for the part (with those smoldering eyes) that I'm sure we're willing to overlook that trifling detail.I had to go and see this film twice because the first time the audience was laughing so uproariously that I missed quite a lot of the dialogue. Nothing to do with seeing Colin Firth again... Honest!  Seriously though, the film is rich and warm and funny because it's so honest -- we can all picture ourselves in poor Bridget's fuzzy slippers, lipsincing to ""All by Myself""...Bridget Jones is an ""every woman's"" film, with a woman who has actual thighs who is sought after by two of the sexiest guys in English film today. What more could one ask?  I highly recommend this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very cute and funny movie,"Bridget Jones's Diary is a very cute funny movie with sexual overtones tastefully done.

I was genuinely surprised by this great film.,"I caught this film at a special preview in January, so it is possible that the version that I saw will be different from the final release.  However on the whole I suspect that they will keep most of it. I was expecting a girly film that I (being a bloke) would not understand and thus not enjoy.  However (after a dodgy karaoke style start) the movie settled down into an enjoyable character driven comedy.  You end up enjoying Bridget's failed attempts at making a mark for herself whilst wishing that all will come good in the end and that she will choose the right man. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth are excellent as the love interests, with both of them having good and bad points, such that you can see why Bridget is attracted to both of them. Zellwegger is great and after a while you get used to her ""English"" accent, although at the start you feel like walking out, but then again the non-English people watching this probably won't even notice. Anyway a great film for both guys and girls, very funny.  Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A laugh riot,"Caught a preview of Bridget Jones's Diary last night and it was uproariously funny. I thought Renee Zellweger captured Bridget's personality on film. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth deliciously portrayed Daniel Cleaver and Mark Darcy. (I loved the ending credits!) The movie did not stray too far from the book, and I think worked on the silver screen. I hope the film is hit. Helen Fielding rocks!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Delightful,"I didn't know what to expect when I went to see this movie, not really a Renee Zellweger fan although I don't dislike her I just thought she was okay but I have to say after seeing this movie, I am so totally impressed and surprised with her performance in this movie. She is adorable and I thought her accent was charming.  She is delightful and funny and I just loved this movie.  Hugh Grant's part was perfect.  I think this was a different role for him and he makes a wonderful cad.  Colin Firth was the serious suitor and was so perfect as Mark Darcy.  I thought this was a very funny movie, not like a lot of movie that try so hard to be funny and just fall short. You have to listen to what she is saying as some of things she says are spoken matter-of-factly but I found them to be extremely funny. This one had me laughing from the very start.  All I can say is to the cast, crew and director Sharon Maguire---Bravo, job well done!!!!  Give us more!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very believable...and very charming!,"Bridget Jones is a real person.  She's someone any of us knows, as are her two would-be suitors, her gadfly friends, her stroppy parents and the melange of people who populate her life in this year.  How they got a woman from Texas to sound so believably British is a minor miracle, and it's one of the many ways Renee Zellweger shines in this role. British women need not despair that an American got this role, because she does them all proud. Though I've not read all of Helen Fielding's book, the film captures the essence of a thirtysomething woman struggling for self-definition in a world of pigeon holes.What was even more refreshing was to see Hugh Grant playing a downright scoundrel, departing from the shy, erstwhile characters he usually plays. He, too, deserves kudos for a totally believable.  So does Colin Firth as the stodgy Mark Darcy.  Though a couple of characters in the book were a bit forgotten, the balance of the film is charming, endearing and down-to-earth. It's a film one can enjoy ""just the way it is.""",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fab!!,"I'm a die hard fan of the books, so I was hopeful but sceptical before I saw the film.All  can say is ""Great!"" It exceeded all my expectations.  Yes, alot is missing from the novel, but it doesn't detract, and the totally new bits are among the best parts of the film.Hugh Grant!  Yum!! That's something I've never thought before, but after watching this you'll understand why.  He is fantastic.  Renee Zellwegger is BJ, and as for Colin Firth, he's basically reprising his role from Pride and Prejudice which we all know he does so well/.I came out grinning, and to me that's the sign of a good film!!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
This movie is really good...,"Yeah, I went out to see this movie a few days ago and I wasn't really expecting it to be very good. I thought it was going to be a boring and dull film.

I never at one time got bored with this movie, it is really good all the way through. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and I think it's really funny too. There are alot of funny scenes in this flick, and it isn't dull humor either. I think it's really really funny at times. All the characters play good roles, I guess what I'm trying to say is that the acting in this movie is really good as well.

"Nice movie in the tradition of ""Four Weddings""","...but not that good.As a Single watching this movie is certainly kind of painful on the one hand, but on the other hand you recognize a lot of yourself in Bridget (even as a man) and therefore you get some delight in knowing that you are not alone with your fate.Especially not when a beautiful girl is sitting next to you in the theater ;-)The movie is light and funny, a nice piece of work but missing the absolute grandeur of ""Four Weddings and a funeral"", still better than ""Notting Hill"". Hugh Grant being a bad guy is hard to swallow - even when he behaves like a total a**hole, he still seems to be nice and funny and therefore he just does not fit into his role - but Renee Zellweger really has done a great job.Recommended to watch any time - you can't do anything wrong with this one!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bridget -- just as she is.,"One of the things that make this film so appealing and so good is the superb casting of absolutely everyone.Renee Zellweger is simply marvelous as the slightly daft Bridget Jones  unsure of who she is, whom she wants to be with, what she wants and how to go about getting it.  The character of Bridget is a bit of storm-tossed flotsam on the sea of life  going where the wind and waves take her and only occasionally taking charge of her own life.Colin Firth  Mr. Darcy in this film and in `Pride and Prejudice'  is dark, brooding and enigmatic: he seems as unsure of what he wants and whom he wants to be with as poor Bridget does.  He underplays his character; and his performance is all the richer for it.Hugh Grant is sublimely smarmy as Daniel Cleaver.  I understand how a woman could fall for such a jerk but you want desperately for them not to.The sound track is great: lots of old songs that evoke the mood and feeling that the film is trying to achieve.Though there is little overt nudity this film is rated `R' for language and sexuality.  I saw this film at a large metroplex theater and the girls in line in front of me bought tickets for a `G' rated film but after the obligatory stop at the concession counter made a beeline for ""Bridget.""  I don't think they were warped for life  but I have never heard the `F' word used more in any film.This is a wonderful example of a plot and story driven film.  No big splashy special effects just a story of a young woman's journey of self-discovery. I highly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A real feel good film to return to time and again.,"I likened this film to Sliding Doors, which to me was another of those 'feel good' films set in England.  It's so effortless to watch, and as a thirty-something so easy to relate to!Excellent casting, good location work and a script which leaves the cinema-goer thinking ""I've been there"".  A very personable film that invites everyone watching to jump into the said diary and follow Bridget Jones on her quest to find companionship and contentment.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Singletons unite!,"A few months ago, I had the great pleasure of reading Helen Fielding's ""Bridget Jones' Diary."" I loved the humor, but was wary as to how well it would translate to the screen. Last night, I got a chance to go to a sneak preview of the film...it fulfilled all my hopes for what the film *should* be. It does prove to be a departure from the novel, but I feel it stays true to what BJD is all about.Zellweger, Grant, and Firth were phenomenal...they embodied their characters, really making them come to life. I was impressed with Zellweger's accent...I would have never guessed that she was a Texan. Her comedic timing was impeccable, adding to the believability of Ms. Jones. :) Bridget has got to be one of the most truly accessible heroines out there...she's flawed, but that doesn't matter. Her humanity is what makes her great.Colin Firth was fantastic. He really made the audience believe that a stuffed shirt like Mark Darcy could really fall in love with a quirky girl like Bridget. Considering that Helen Fielding has often commented that her inspiration for Mark Darcy was Firth's portrayal of Mr. Darcy in A&E's Pride and Prejudice (1995), it's no wonder that I couldn't imagine another actor in that role.Austen fans, be sure to watch for the parallels between BJD and P&P...even some of the camera angles in Bridget Jones Diary echo scenes in the Pride & Prejudice mini-series.I know this has already been said in other reviews, but it's so true...the audience was laughing so hard during the movie that I did miss occasional bits of dialogue. Bottom line, this is a witty film, with great dialogue, and a nice message...you don't need to a be a supermodel to find love...there can be someone out there who'll like you just the way you are.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Underrated!,"IMDb user rating of ""6.8""? What flick were they watching? This is so egregiously underrated, some kinda rebuttal is in order. What you get with ""Diary"" is merely superior British comedy in the style of ""Knotting Hill"", hilarious lines delivered at peak effectiveness (""Sod off!""), my favorite actress (Renee Zellwegger), who stole the show in EVERY show she's ever been in (e.g., ""Chicago"", ""Jerry McGuire"", ""Cold Mountain"", et. al.), and what is probably the BEST synchronized soundtrack to screenplay ever put together. The run time is listed as 97 minutes. It took me a 2+ hours to get through the DVD because of the timeouts wiping away the tears of laughter from my eyes.

"Wonderful, must see movie","Renée Zellweger packs a punch as a 30-something Bridget Jones in the brilliantly directed movie ""Bridget Jones's Diary"". She takes this character and embodies her as no one else can. Even though she is a native Texan, you'd never know it due to the superb work done by dialogue coach Barbara Berkery. While the movie does not stay true to the book, the literary license that has been taken is so cleverly done it doesn't really matter. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth, as her two suitors, are equally convincing in their roles. The plot line follows Bridget from one New Years to the next through her daily diary entries. She makes several resolutions to make her life better and as we find out, they don't exactly work out that way. From the very beginning of this movie, you'll find yourself captivated with her wit and humor. Aimed mainly at the female audience, this film charms one and all.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Renee Zellwegger (and yummy Colin Firth) were marvelous!,"Very, very good film overall. Renee Zellwegger was brilliant. Colin Firth his yummy self as smoldering hero. Even men friends have loved it -- the fight scene especially, I'm told. Audience laughing loudly and throughout. Was slightly disappointed in ending (bit too contrived and sappy) and annoyed, occasionally, with melodramatic violins (e.g., during ""Tarts and Vicars"" party, when Bridget smoked with her dad outside and during Naked-American-Stick-Insect- Sitting-on-Bathtub"" moment). Otherwise, the music enhanced many of the scenes (e.g., ""All by Myself,"" ""It's raining men,"" ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough,"" etc.). But the crowing glory was Renee's performance. Without her nuances of expression and comedic timing -- I think audiences would have been more critical of this first-time director's cut-and-pasted look. It definitely needed tighter editing and a better flow (musically and otherwise). Also, the British humor was sometimes completely lost on the Americans. Most American women don't find sexual flirting in the workplace funny, or comments from men to women like ""...you dirty bit__"" or ""...you ham-fisted cu__"" funny either. Nor do Americans find heavy smoking and drinking particularly funny. They can't really relate. Wonderfully naughty British humor. Would highly recommend the film, despite criticisms. To tell you the truth, when I raised these issues with friends, they all thought I was being too picky. Everyone I know has adored this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Bridget is so vulnerable and yet she is stronger than she gives herself credit for. She is sensitive and sensible, yet she doesn't know it yet.

Attractive film,"Though I gave it an 8 out of 10, I am very fascinated with this flick (I intended to rate it 9). This film again consolidates my theory that the British really knows how to offer the first class romance without humiliate the audience¡¦s intellect. Many of American romances appeal to the sensual attraction, with poor performance and terrible story, while English counterparts usually carry on with extraordinary casting and more serious implications. B.J. is no exception. Again we see the energy and power of British actors and actresses, with whose excellent jobs enrich the texture of the whole film. Of course Renee Zellweger is brilliant, who actually enlivens the woman with all kinds of foibles but at the same time makes it impossible for viewers to dislike her. The songs fit into the story seamlessly, and cinematography and composition of certain shots are unforgettable. However there is one reason that keeps me from rating it higher. While I expected to see a female enlightenment in this film, I found the ending quite disappointing in this dimention. B.J.¡¦s success in her career is a gift offered by Darcy, and her happiness, obviously, relies mainly on her love life.

Harmless chick flick,"See this movie if you're female. But make it a girls' night out, and leave him at home. Don't say I didn't warn you.Bridget Jones is a neurotic, lonely, but ultimately likable character. She is a heavy smoker, a heavy drinker, a few pounds overweight, British, a terrible public speaker, and has terrible judgment when it comes to relationships, but these qualities only help make her human and make it easier for people to identify with her. Of course, the fact that her character is portrayed by the very un-British and un-fat Renee Zellweiger makes some of what she says a little hard to believe. Despite this, Zellweiger pulls off the role with charm and grace - not an easy feat.The story itself has no surprises. From the first five minutes, everyone in the theatre knew exactly how it would end. There's no exciting revelation or universal truth to this tale. It's a simple romantic story, and it doesn't pretend to be anything else.Hugh Grant plays a fairly one-dimensional bad guy, and Colin Firth an equally flat good guy. Aside from the lead role, there are no noteworthy acting performances here.I haven't read the book, but I hear that some of the quirkiness is lost in the movie. In addition, the movie has some issues with the plot that just scream ""should have been cut out when adapted from book"". After a while, watching Bridget make the same mistakes over and over again gets a little tiresome. But ultimately, the story works.All in all, she's a likable heroine and we identify with her. The story is realistic and charming and, above all, harmless. It's a chick flick, but go see it if you're looking for a light laugh.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the Best!,"Where do I begin? This movie was brilliant. I was very surprised that they actually turned a great book into a great movie! Sharon Maguire, the director, really captured the humor of the book on film! Renee Zellweger, Collin Firth, and Hugh Grant were the perfect choices for the characters, and acted wonderfully. Gemma Jones, Bridget's mother, was so funny, running off with a new guy. Coming from a ""singleton"" point of view, this movie really captured the singles scene. Rent the movie and read the book!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absolutely hilarious!,"So I'm not 30 something, in fact I'm quite under that but Bridget Jones has me extremely worried about that 30 something when I hit it!!  I rolled off the chair at least 100 times during this british comedy! Not only did I see it once in theatres but I dragged along a group for it a second time!! And then one of my friends saw it five more times after that when she dragged along various friends and family members. While the humor may be sick at times and the ""f"" word a little over used (but well used at that!) I just can't wait till it's out on video. And the best part. It's not a chick flick!!  I dragged along the boyfriend and a few male friends and they loved it too!! So there you go, hats off to you Miss Bridget Jones!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

FANTASTIC! Laugh your knickers off! A great surprise!,"I couldn't make it through 5 pages of Hellen Fielding's novel, which seemed to me superficial and self-pitying.

Renee was absolutely pitch-perfect--I think she should have won an Oscar.Her comic timing was PERFECT. The whole movie was so  well-directed and well-edited that I don't think there is a moment that I would change.  The sound-track was amazing, and like the movie laugh-inspiring and energizing. From the script to the cinematography to the details of costuming, everything was FANTASTIC. All of the supporting characters were also well-fleshed out and riotous.

10/10,"Based on Helen Fielding's hugely popular novel, this romantic comedy follows Bridget (Renee Zellweger), a post-feminist, thirty-something British woman who has a penchant for alcoholic binges, smoking, and an inability to control her weight. While trying to keep these things in check and also deal with her job in publishing, she visits her parents for a Christmas party. They try to set her up with Mark (Colin Firth), the visiting son of one of their neighbors. Snubbed by Mark, she instead falls for her boss Daniel (Hugh Grant), a dashing lothario who begins to send her suggestive e-mails that soon lead to a dinner date proposition. Daniel reveals that he and Mark attended college together, during which time Mark had an affair with his fiancée. When Bridget finds Daniel cavorting with an American colleague, she decides to change her life with a new job as a TV presenter. At a dinner party, she bumps into Mark again, who expresses his affection for her; when Daniel claims he wants Bridget back, the two fight over who deserves her affections the most. Popular British performers Gemma Jones, Jim Broadbent, and Shirley Henderson appear in the supporting cast.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"The fate that awaits all thirysomethings, I wish.","This is a MUST, MUST, MUST see film. There are too many funny moments to pick one out, although the knicker scene is destined to become a classic. The whole cinema was laughing at the misadventures of this 32 year old single female trying to have a life despite everyone else. In the end she finds happiness with the right man, of course. The journey there is in parts touching but the story is always told with humour. Anyone who said that a Texan could not play a sometimes dowdy Englishwoman had not allowed for the tour-de-force performance by Zellweger, any doubts about her acting ability, in some quarters are definitely laid to rest here. The supporting English cast were excellant as were Grant and Firth, (the fight scene!?)This is going to be one of the high spots of my cinema going year.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

I have to confess to not having read the book (yet) but having read all the reviews in the London papers while visiting and being bombarded so much with it, I was actually very excited to go see it.I dragged all my friends to the sneak preview and had a blast!  The gals will love it because it is a beautiful romantic comedy and the guys will even enjoy the humor and might learn a thing or two about women.Colin Firth is perfect as the brooding Mr. Darcy, and his dry demeanor almost turns us off until it wins us completely.  Hugh Grant is maddenly the wrong guy we all love to want, and Renee, well, she is amazing.  Although I haven't liked the comments I've heard from Renee after the movie about her weight gain, it's great to see a real size woman garner the attention of two of the hottest men on the screen right now.

Loved it,"Colin Firth as Darcy Part Two made this movie for me.  He was great!  I have a feeling that there are a lot of people who haven't seen the BBC ""Pride and Prejudice"" in which he starred as Jane Austen's Darcy and who therefore don't ""get it.""  Some of those people might think that he comes across as cardboard, inanimate, and even humorless.  However, Firth makes Darcy so subtle, so just completely as much the off-center character that Austen intended that it's possible to miss how great he is.  Firth is Darcy and he is perfect.  He is full of humor, unseen strength, and, above all, amazing sex appeal.  If you didn't see it in him the first time, watch Bridget Jones's Diary again (a great flick - Hugh Grant is totally on target), re-read Austen's Pride and Prejudice, and just look into those brown eyes of Firth's.  It's all there.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Jon Monsarrat review:  safe for non-romance types, funny & original","I'm an action movie guy. I like it when stuff blows up. So it's awkward for me to rent movies with my SO, who likes dramas. We often choose a comedy / romance, and some are pretty bad. Fortunately, ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" is the best of the lot, along with ""High Fidelity"", and best of all in a refreshing break from tradition, it comes with a female protagonist. Hey, I'm a guy, and even I get tired of every damn movie starring a male in the primary role, even the romantic comedies, which cater of course to an audience of women.The film is genuinely hilarious and quite original, unlike the generic films ""Serendipity"" and ""Pretty Woman"". And like ""High Fidelity"", it has something real to say about life without being so arty that the pace drags or only a film school type could appreciate it. In fact, apparently it's based on the classic book ""Pride and Prejudice"", but the deep thinking remains while the hard-to-identify-with British Victorian stuff is all gone, replaced with the hip modern stuff you'd see in ""Sex and the City"".The acting is good, and since I liked this film even better than ""Jerry Maguire"", I'm really starting to respect Renee Zellweger, who got an Academy Award nomination for her role.Who should see this film:-- romance types: a must-see-- comedy-lovers: dare this one even if romances scare you-- women in their 30s thinking way too much about datingI'll give ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" a 10 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wonderful treat!,"I was a single who spent most of her twenties living in London during the 1960s. This movie is spot on! I couldn't fault Zellwegger's accent at all. Hugh Grant is finally playing the kind of sleaze-bag we know he must be in reality and Colin Firth was the obvious choice for Mark Darcy. Loads of laughs right through and I loved the fight scene, especially with Geri Halliwell's 'It's Raining Men'. It's politically incorrect these days to show a lot of smoking and drinking, but that was certainly part of the scene in the past. Suspend your political correctness and your cynicism. Go see it and have a ball!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Oh, this is so much fun!!","I watched this movie unwillingly--a friend encouraged me to see it, since I thought it was just going to be a sex-diary sort of movie. As a fan of Zellweger's from ""Nurse Betty,"" I really enjoyed seeing her in this film. She looked like a ""normal"" woman, and the humor was wonderfully down-to-earth. I've never been a fan of Grant's, but I was happy to finally seeing him playing the greasy playboy I've always thought he was, and happy that he DIDN'T get the girl! (Drove me nuts that he kept playing stuttering nice guys in all these period movies, getting all dressed up and looking innocently lost. Gag.) But the guy who DID get the girl... ""Ummm,"" I thought (since I was unable to really get out a coherent thought :), ""Who IS this guy?!"" He gets the girl in this movie opposite two well-known movie stars, and I've never heard of him before!? So I wandered over to the IMDb and discovered Colin Firth (and ""Pride and Prejudice""! WATCH THIS MOVIE!! :), and have never been the same since. :) People wrote articles asking the question: ""Grant or Firth?"" and I snort. Firth, of course. Hands-down. No competition, and there never was. Grant is just an overly-confident British guy with a posh accent. Firth...is worth admiring. The final sequence of the film with him in that great coat and turtleneck and look oh so...um... Anyway, that whole sequence makes up for all of the grating you have to endure for Bridget's sake to get through the Grant parts to the really good parts at the end of film, when Grant's character is finally out of the picture.In any case, all three actors (and the supporting cast) do a really wonderful job with this movie. You will laugh--guys AND girls--and not mind watching it again. I've never before seen a fight scene like the one this movie has.Downsides: a lot of obscenities. Otherwise, though, this is a really fun movie. And you have to appreciate the whole ""Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy"" background to understand how truly ironic and wickedly funny this movie actually is. There is a whole subculture in the female English-speaking world surrounding Mr. Firth, and this film capitalizes (and is actually partially based on) this subculture. Bridget Jones is the embodiment of 30-something unmarried females who love watching ""Pride and Prejudice."" :) Enjoy!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Deserving Chick Flick!,"It must be some kind of unwritten rule that men are supposed to despise chick flicks. I myself despise the bad ones, but I can enjoy the good ones. Surprisingly enough, Bridget Jones's Diary can fit into that latter category. The rom-com looked so clichéd and dull based off the trailers, but instead it's a warm, charming, and funny film. It's not the greatest and not entirely original, but it's still a charming British rom com.Sharon Maguire's film is about a woman in her 30's named Bridget Jones who is struggling to find love and is a little plump, and have smoking and drinking problems. Her life becomes even more confusing when these two men fall for her in different ways: her boss who has got everything a woman would want and a lawyer who is socially awkward.This film is well-acted. Renee Zellweger's role is actually quite daring and she is perfect for this role. She plays it with her best and I'm not sure if anyone else would be right for this role. Both Hugh Grant and Colin Firth were excellent and quite charming as two men with opposite personalities fighting for the same woman(in one great scene, there was a legit fight.) Gemma Jones was excellent as Bridget's crazy mother.Overall, Bridget Jones's Diary is a rather solid chick flick. It seems a little overdrawn and it is not totally original, but one cannot deny the charm the film oozes out. It's a warm film and it has simple messages of love. I am not sure if the film was in need of a sequel as the ending was so perfect, but I know I'll check it out at some point. A very charming romantic comedy and I am pleasantly surprised. I rate this film 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Loved This Movie But Now Have Insane Crush on Colin Firth!,"I was pleasantly surprised to find that I actually like the movie better than the book.  My only disappointments were that the movie is way too short and that Colin Firth is not on-screen nearly enough.The entire cast does a fantastic job of bringing Bridget Jones's quirky world to life.  Renee Zellweger effectively portrays Bridget Jones as slightly ridiculous but lovable, and Hugh Grant and Colin Firth are perfect in their respective roles.  It's certainly nice to see Hugh Grant finally take a break from the foppish, stuttering, self-deprecating persona he's been cultivating ever since Four Weddings & a Funeral---and his new buff look (as made evident in the lake/wet shirt scene) isn't bad either!  I only wish the writers had come up with a reason to have Colin shirtless (or at least wet!)As much as I enjoyed the movie, the reason I and my friends have already seen this movie several times and will buy the DVD the day it comes out is Colin Firth and his quietly (but devastatingly) mesmerizing performance. Several critics have commented that Renee Zellweger and Colin Firth have no chemistry, but I beg to differ.  That very palpable chemistry (The way he looks at her when she's interviewing him? The incredibly charming cooking scene? The scene near the end where he leans down to kiss her on the cheek before she runs off to change into ""genuinely tiny knickers""?) is what makes the ultimate resolution of the movie so satisfying.Having long been a fan of British films, I've always been aware of Colin Firth as an accomplished actor (e.g., Another Country, A Month in the Country, Valmont), but it wasn't until Pride & Prejudice that it dawned on me that he was also incredibly attractive.  He then went on to play rather unappealing characters in such films as Circle of Friends, The English Patient and Shakespeare in Love, and, me being the fickle fan that I am, forgot about my crush on him . . . until now.  As a ""serious actor,"" he seems to choose roles that will ""challenge"" him, and unfortunately for us besotted fans, they are often unattractive villains and cuckolds.  But I've come to realize that the fact that he is so successful at masking his undeniable attractiveness is a testament to his extraordinary acting ability.It was clear from Disney's marketing and PR campaign that they felt Renee Zellweger and Hugh Grant would be the only draws here in the U.S., but I know a lot of people who went to see the movie because of Colin Firth.  I can only hope this film will earn him the recognition of audiences (and studios) beyond the legions of women who fell in love with him in P&P. It'd certainly be wonderful to see him fulfill his promise as a leading man (a la Ralph Fiennes and Russell Crowe) and leave all those ""character actor"" roles behind him.It looks like Working Title Films is already talking with Renee Zellweger about making the film version of ""Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason."" Apparently, she's only interested if she doesn't have to gain weight again. Let's keep our fingers crossed that Colin Firth's desire to pursue more challenging roles  doesn't keep him from signing on for the sequel.  I can't imagine anyone else playing the role of Mark Darcy.Finally, I'd just like to say that I wholeheartedly agree with other IMDB users who've described Colin Firth as ""sex on a stick,"" ""dreamy,"" ""swoonsome,"" ""a revelation,"" ""beautiful,"" ""delicious,"" ""riveting"" and weak-knee inducing.  I wonder how many of us will be trekking to London next year to see him on-stage in Hamlet?    SIGH . . .",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Moving and convincing performance by Zellwegger,"Being a thirtysomething single woman, Bridget Jones' Diary hit an emotional soft spot.

Then everybody started screaming: ""Oh my god, there playing Bridget, their playing Bridget"". This includes me, I waited so long for this film to come out, and I was so happy to see it at last. The film was really great, the type of humor used was fantastic, and the actors were even better. I really liked Hugh Grant, in a completely different character then the usual.

"A ""Must See"" for this Romantic Comedy!!","I enjoyed the movie, then went out and bought the book and sound-track.  I think the character I fell in love with Mark Darcy.  He was at first a ""cold fish"", but later as he revealed himself layer by layer, showed that he was a kind person, that loved his mother.  (Whoever would wear those cute but totally unsuitable jumpers or ties that he gets for Christmas. hehehe)His character reminded me so much of Fitzwilliam Darcy of Pride and Prejudice.  It turns out that Colin Firth has played Mr. Darcy in the BBC TV series.Interestingly, in the movie Mark Darcy possessed some of Mr. Darcy's characteristics - the aloof, snobbish trait, and then later (in the book) saves the day with his unselfish nature, assisting the heroine's family out of a bad situation.Karen Toh",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Not just a ""chick flick""","I'm going to have to agree with the sentiments seen in other comments where men essentially said ""I went to see this with my girlfriend, thinking it would be a 'chick flick', and was surprised to find it was really funny."" If you're a guy, it's a relatively painless way to score points for ""suffering through"" a movie that your wife or girlfriend will definitely want to see.Bridget is a sort of everywoman.  She'll likely remind you of at least one female friend, if not more.  It's easy to become emotionally invested in Bridget's successes and failures, and suspend disbelief (forgetting that it's an actress playing a character) while watching the film.Personally, I would have liked to see a bit more of Bridget's father in the film, but only because I think Jim Broadbent is such a great character actor.  Other than that, I find it hard to find fault with the film.  It's well paced, lots of good solid laughs, and a satisfying end.I've recommended it to my mom, my sister, and any of my male friends who have a wife or girlfriend to take.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Cute Romantic Comedy,"I really enjoy this movie.  We first see 32 year old Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger)at her mother's annual turkey curry buffet.  We see some of the main people in her life, her parents, her ""uncle"" Jeffrey (How many of us have had an ""uncle Jeffrey in our lives that we've had to endure, because it's just ""harmless fun"", raise your hand), and Mark Darcy (played by Colin Firth), a divorced lawyer who his and Bridget's parents are trying to get together.Unfortunately, their first meeting gets off on the wrong foot, and Bridget spends that night drinking herself silly, alone in her apartment, listening and air-voicing to ""All by Myself"".  However, she decides to keep a diary. In her first entry she resolves to find a good man, and avoid her attractive boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant).However, he starts making suggestive sexual innuendos to her, and, enjoying the attention, she starts dressing in a miniskirt and see-through top, and passing silly, flirtatious e-mails back and forth. She seeks advice from her 3 best friends on how to handle this. This sequence events leads to a purely sexual relationship between Daniel and Bridget, although Bridget is a bit too naive and insecure to really see this.We learn that Daniel and Mark are archenemies due to some events in the past which led to Mark's wife leaving him.  Also, because Mark and Bridget often travel in the same circles, we do learn that Mark's opinion of Bridget has quickly changed.  From the look on his face, it's easy to see that he now likes her (Hmmm shades of Mr Darcy in Pride and Prejudice)Anyay, Bridget eventually catches Daniel with another woman, and once again she is alone, and decides to seek another job as a television reporter. Mark rescues Bridget from being canned from her job, by allowing her an interview with people he was defending in a high profile case.  After this Bridget tries to cook a dinner for her 3 best friends and Mark shows up and is able to show his feelings for her.  Daniel also shows up, and he and Mark wind up in a hilarious fight sequence over Bridget.While we are supposed to root for Mark to win Bridget, (I did), I was bothered by one thing.  Bridget was the one he wanted, but he was too spineless to break up his romantic involvement with Natasha, his law partner.  He even let it get to the point of the two of them becoming engaged before the predictable ending.  You could tell, everytime Natasha snapped her fingers and said ""Come on, Mark"", that he was kind of sheepishly following her.I saw one review here that criticized Mark's saying ""You are a bad public speaker, you tend to run off at the mouth, but I like you just the way you are.""  I like that honesty, and I like being unafraid to let myself show to someone I like, and still have acceptance.  I'd rather have that, than someone blowing false sunshine in my face.All in all, I gave the movie an 8/10, would have been a 9, had it not been for Mark's attitude of ""settling"" when he thought he couldn't have Bridget.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant Bridget,"The story of a career girl in London fighting herself, her boss, her mother and her dinner parties. Ingredients for a comedy? Most definately.Settling down in a darkened room, having to endure the loud grating snickering of hysterical teenage girls is certainly not in my top 20 'things to do' list. But, come to think of it...Seriously, this is a raucous British comedy which left me feeling good.The story's simple. A three way love triangle theme, the way of many a great theatrical yarn. And this is great!  Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) meets Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), a barrister of great repute, at one of her mother's yearly 'curry' get togethers. The word 'repel' would not fully describe their first rendezvous. Bridget works in the hustle and bustle world of London publishing,Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) is her sexually carniverous boss who charms 'Jones' to bed, a seemingly perfect match. Rejection leads her to begin her diary.The screenplay written by Richard Curtis(Four Weddings, Blackadder et c. et c. et c.) and Andrew Davies(Middlemarch et c. et c. et c. ) adapted from the novel by Helen Fielding  gallops on and on, at a pace that doesn't leave you much time to breathe, with stylish wit and humour. All credit has to be given to the director Sharon Maguire for keeping hold of those reigns!The role of Bridget Jones, certainly controversial, was an inspired choise.  Renee Zellweger was so convincing as the clumsy, bumbling, thirty-something looking for Mr. Right - You'll just fall in love with her! Colin Firth and Hugh Grant deserve their due. Also, watch out for Sally Philips the hip and crazy 'journo' Sharon ""Shazzer"". From the hilarious 'Smack the Pony' and a multitude of TV roles to the widescreen of cinema - let's hope her career continues to flourish.All in all, this is not a 'classic'and does not pretend to be so. It's just good fun - so get down to the cinema and join in!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fantastic!,"For any single woman over 30, the book ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" is one of the most real snapshots of our lifestyle.  Going in with the fear that ""the movie is never as good as the book,"" I was happily proved wrong.  Renee Zellweger brought Bridget to life - she captured Bridget perfectly.  Hugh Grant and Colin Firth were wonderful, too.  After three months of prodding, my boyfriend - not a fan of chick flicks - finally agreed to see it with me - and he laughed until he cried.

Get a bottle of wine and some chocolate in.....,"Get a bottle of wine and some chocolate in.....have the girls over and sing along to the cool soundtrack! Bravo casting in the shape of the delectable Colin Firth and even Hugh Grant acts wonderfully against type as dastardly Cleaver. Better than the book, singletons everywhere can relate to Bridget's struggle to find a genuine guy. Surprisingly well played by Renee Zellwegger who comes off as a less annoyingly neurotic Bridget than in the book. Excellent performances by co-stars - particularly Jim Broadbent as Bridget's Dad and a great sub-plot involving Bridget's Mum and a perma-tanned shopping channel guru called Julian. Great cameos from some great British comedy actors add to make this the perfect video for a great night in! Worth the rental if only to watch the opening ""All By Myself"" scene and the explosive Darcy/Cleaver confrontation.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

In fact, I may have laughed harder because I was able to catch things I had missed the first time.Renee Zellwegger was great, Colin Firth was (sigh) wonderful, Hugh Grant was a brilliant cad, Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent were terrific... I could go on forever.  True, it doesn't follow the book exactly, but the departures worked for me.  ""Pride & Prejudice"" is one of my favorite books, and BJD does for P&P what ""Clueless"" did for ""Emma"" and ""Metropolitan"" did for ""Mansfield Park.""

"Bridget, she's not perfect, but...","Before I begin my review, I must admit I am a big fan of English comedy movies. Renee Zellweger was absolutely wonderful in this movie. Her English accent was dead on the target. In fact, I saw the movie with some friends from the U.K., and they complimented her endlessly on her performance.

Laugh out loud. REALLY loud.,"Bridget Jones is a chubby, single woman in her early 30's who drinks, smokes, and has a mediocre job. Every year during the holidays, her mother tries to hook her up with some middle aged, boring, dull guy, in whom Bridget has NOinterest.

The best film Ive seen in ages!,"This has got to be one of the best films I have seen in ages!

I've been there, I've done that ... and even through all my humiliation, I laughed. Thank goodness they made a movie about it! I roared with laughter and felt the tears. But happy endings are possible and not just in the movies. This story is definitely the modernization of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" but is more true to life than the funky ""Clueless"". Men may not understand all the things women are about, but I bet most will be able to see at least part of Bridget in their girlfriends or wives. Women have long known that their are only two types of men ... the bad boy and the nice boy. The only question is, which do they prefer. I think Bridget has the right idea.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

no disappointment here,"I have to say my stomach turned when I heard Renee Z was to be cast as Bridget Jones, but I was remarkably surprised to see that she had done a fantastic job portraying Bridget Jones, at moments hilarious and pathetic . Her accent could be better, but it didn't plague me through the film. As for Hugh Grant and Colin Firth one word: YUMMY!!! I was slightly disappointed to see the role of Bridget's friends: Shazz, Jude and Tom reduced to small appearances, only appearing to give Bridget comical insights to her romantic problems. Kudos to the screenwriters Andrew Davies and Richard Curtis. They had the balls to change things around yet keep the essence of the book and its characters alive.

"A clever, witty script. Generally a well observed comedy.","I was very dubious about watching this movie, being a man, however within the first five minutes I was laughing heartily and knew, without a doubt, that this movie was going to be a good one. I wasn't wrong. Even for the men, this movie contains much to identify with, even with the Bridget Jones character. The whole cast is fantastic, with Hugh Grant showing that he can actually pull off a really good role. Renee Zellweger is superb in the lead, and you just can't help liking her and her embarrassing habit of putting her foot in it. There are some clever and witty one-liners and some wonderfully put together scenes, with some well-observed comedy. I whole-heartedly recommend this film, despite the over sentimental ending, it does the job and gives you that nice warm feeling at the end of it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Brilliant comedy, very entertaining","I have not read Helen Fielding's novel upon which this film is based, and I have no wish to do so after I have seen the film. Don't get me wrong, though, I thought the movie was absolutely brilliant, but I'm sure that the novel will be a disappointment since it can't possibly be as good as this film (and a friend of mine dislikes the novel intensely, and since I don't have the time to read all the books I want to read I trust her judgment on this one).Bridget Jones's Diary is very entertaining, often hilarious, and also rather cute. Renée Zellweger, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth all deliver fantastic performances. Firth is the 'favourite' since he's also been brilliant in the best televisions series ever made (Pride and Prejudice) and one of my all time favourite films (Valmont). This film was actually better than I expected, and I expected much before me and my sister saw it at the cinema today. Brilliant film, another top British comedy. (8/10)",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A girl in her thirties looking for love or a Madwoman: part one,"A romantic comedy. A screen adaptation of the novel of the same name by the English writer Helen Fielding. I will say nothing for the book, because I have not read it, so I will evaluate the film adaptation as an independent work. I decided to take a break from the cinema of the fifties and sixties, and wanted to see something modern, and then a friend advised this romantic comedy, which this year hit its anniversary - it's twenty years old, a round date. So this part also became the beginning of a trilogy about the adventures of the extravagant girl Bridget Jones, which we will talk about in the near future, because I aimed to watch the whole trilogy, but today we will deal with the first part, which was a tremendous success with the audience. And here's my brief opinion - A girl over thirty is looking for love. I was completely delighted with the picture, and I did not even find any minuses as such (although I looked meticulously), so I will only note the expressive merits of this romantic comedy.So, here they are:
1. Scenario - Richard Curtis was responsible for it (to which I promised to return after watching ""Notting Hill"" and ""Boyfriend from the Future""). And if you promised, then be kind and fulfill it! This is what I am doing. So, the picture tells the story of Bridget Jones, a lonely girl in her thirties who lives in London and who is terribly unlucky in love. Parents and friends are already beginning to sound the alarm, because the years are flying, and Bridget herself understands that if she does not hurry now, then the ending of life will not be at all rosy. How well two guys turn up, both of the same age and handsome, but with completely different characters. And now the word is for Bridget, who must listen to the voice of reason and determine which of these two will become ""the one"" with whom she will forever connect her life. The final for the rom-com is classic, there are no twists, no intrigue - and despite this, the picture looks in one breath and makes the viewer worry about the characters and Bridget herself. A classic romcom that works and will always work. If you are waiting for a simple story about the search for true love - then you definitely come here!2. Bridget Jones - the whole picture rests solely on the main character, her behavior, manners, character, humor (more on that below), and of course on the acting talent of Renee Zellweger. Bridget manages to simultaneously repel and attract the viewer with her antics and thrown inappropriately words. Well, the basis of the basics is her diary, where she writes down all the innermost thoughts. René here anneals so brightly and talentedly that not to pat it would be the height of indecency. She so convincingly played a madcap with enchanting annealing, and at the same time a gentle and vulnerable girl, capable of sincere feelings and excessive emotionality. The rest of the actors were no less convincing, but it was Rene who carried the bulk of the weight.3. Humor - subtlety, grace, rudeness, vulgarity (in some places) it is all there and it works exactly as it should. Of course, Bridget is the one who gives out the bulk of the humor - and that's great. I often caught myself in bouts of ""Spanish shame"" when Bridget did things that made her, and me, and me even more ashamed than her. Well, how can we go without the heroine's comments regarding these very annealing. The diary style here plays into the hands not only of the narration itself, but also of humor. He laughed heartily at almost all the moments.4. Memorable scenes - well, how could it be without it, I will not list them, because I do not want to spoil the viewing for those who have not yet watched this romantic comedy. I can only say that in them I also had bouts of ""Spanish shame"", because it was both funny and ashamed. And without Bridget's comments, these scenes would have been only half the fun!5. Music - lyrical, pop of the late nineties and early zero, plus classics from the eighties, which fit perfectly into the romantic atmosphere of this comedy. I even wanted to sing along. I am sure that you will easily recognize most of the compositions if you love music.A little about the main characters:
1. Bridget Jones performed by Renee Zellweger is an extravagant girl in her thirties with classic complexes for her age, who is trying to find true love. Awkward, funny and extremely memorable person. Rene is just a miracle here! Kisses to the pen!2. Daniel Cleaver played by Hugh Grant - Bridget's boss, with whom she starts a relationship that seems to her to be ""the very one."" Daniel is the typical wealthy bachelor with great ambition and character, the role of which old Hugh did very well.3. Mark Darcy performed by Colin Firth is a childhood friend of Bridget, a silent and quiet man, invisibly present somewhere nearby, in which a predatory beast clearly lives, ready to break out. What can I say, because Colin was no less convincing in this role and earned our sympathy. Well done!Frankly, the picture surprised me a lot and made me laugh and even think about some points, and the audience success also makes me happy. And now the picture already has a cult status and it definitely deserved it (in contrast to ""Casablanca""). And I just have to join those viewers who sincerely love this picture. And I am sure that one day I will definitely revise it, and more than once.But I'm a little afraid for the continuation, because the story ended here. What could be continued there? Well, okay, we'll see as they say. Well, next time we will meet after watching the second part of the trilogy ""Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason."" Until then, good luck to everyone!As a result, we have an excellent romantic comedy, with an excellent script, great romantic atmosphere, great humor, good and atmospheric music and great acting. Renee Zellweger did her best!My rating is 8 out of 10 and my strong recommendation for viewing!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very Brave!,"After seeing this movie, having not read the book beforehand, I felt relieved.  I thought that *I* was the only goofy, neurotic female, in the world that spoke without thinking, is horrible public speaker and wore cool pajamas?!  I now know that I have sisters in Britain!!  UNITE!I LOVE THIS MOVIE!  I LOVE THIS CHARACTER!  ""Mark Darcy"" is the reason why I am still single.  For the simple fact that, I'm holding out for the fairy tale -- *I* deserve nothing less.  ""Mark Darcy"" proves that there are nice guys out there who aren't absolutely CLUELESS and afraid of love. This movie not only made me want to hold on to my ""fairy tale,"" but it also made me believe that it CAN happen.  It also made me want to read the book and learn about British culture.  Call me delusional, but I think there's too much seriousness and fear in our world.  Why not want the fairy tale?  Why not be brave?  THANK YOU HELEN FIELDING!

"Funny, insightful if occasionally cringeworthy","Having never read the books and not been over influenced by the hype for this movie, I went to see it with an open mind, and was thoroughly impressed.  Renee Z is distinctly likeable as the eponymous heroine who's New Year resolutions slowly come to fulfilment throughout the year.  Her unlucky stumblings through relationships, public speaking and fancy dress parties keeps the viewer entertained throughout and often induces the odd empathic cringe (Salman Rushdie's experience especially).  And to be brutally honest her british accent isn't that bad. Hugh Grant is also well cast in the part of the office cad and Colin Firth plays the british barrister to perfection (trust me, I know enough) In all well made, well acted, well funny 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Despite hitting all the right notes, Bridget Jones' Diary still falls into a romantic comedy cliché.","32-year old spinster and lunatic Bridget Jones is alone and aloof, living in London with no love to call her own. She made a resolution to start writing in a diary, promising herself to get better physically and simultaneously dealt with other life problems. Things start to change this year when she met two men that somehow gravitated towards her but despised each other's company.Romantic comedies usually suffer from the case of a predictable plot and generic characters. This movie doesn't escape those stereotypes either. Packed with a clever script and solid execution, this movie tiptoes the romantic parts and the comedic ones. Some moments were definitely a bit too sweet to be true and too wacky of a comedy, yet somehow it has all the right twists and turns of a movie that will keep you glued. Sure, it has a big unnecessary subplot just to fill the empty duration, but with a supporting cast this strong, I wouldn't mind having to take a break from all the love triangle that was going on.Renee Zellweger and Colin Firth may not have that strong of a chemistry, but throw Hugh Grant into the mix and somehow all three of them play each other off really well. Zellweger particularly went lengths for this movie, and I must applaud her for her impeccable comedic timing and sweet charm that lured me into liking her careless, clueless character.It was a sweet romantic comedy for a date night, but don't expect anything original or mind-blowing about it. It's still just a fun romantic comedy, amazingly engineered and well-acted.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Her accent is surprisingly good -- she can even sing and yell well with it. Hugh Grant shows awesome range in his acting.  Well, not really.  He's usually the stuttering cute moron or the annoyingly gorgeous jerk and he's the latter in this one.

Well worth seeing!,"This was a brilliant movie. Renee doing Bridget Jones was extremely well done. To see a typical normal woman doing goofy things and being a normal healthy size female (goes to show you can look sexy without having to be the shape of a stick) made it a truly enjoyable movie. Renee should be very proud of her performance.Hugh shedding his image of 'Mr Perfect' was a nice change, though I love his movies and these roles.  He does the character of Daniel Cleaver being a cad very well and I'm sure there are many males out there that can relate to Daniel's dilemmas with relationships.Colin, what can I say, he was exceptional.  His performance was flawless and was a great shame he didn't get more screen time,  I look forward to seeing more of Colin's work in the future. His character of Mark Darcy is heart warming without being mushy or going too far and being labelled with a 'Mr Perfect' tag after Mark makes some insensitive comments.  The highlight of the movie, however, was the ""just the way you are"" scene between Bridget and Mark. It was moving.Colin, Renee and Hugh each deserve top awards for their excellent performances and Helen for her excellent writing. 9 out of 10 (It would have been a 10 if it had more Mark Darcy screen time!)",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Renee Zellweger did a brilliant job as Bridget, and pulled off the accent well. I loved Colin Firth, he was so good as Mr Darcy and seeing him play Mark Darcy after Helen Fielding based the character of Mark on Firth's performance in Pride and Prejudice was just great.

Renee steals the show,"Bridget Jones's Diary is one of the best comedies I've ever seen. Why? I assume it's because every character is so relatable - none of them are cartoonish - maybe a bit clicheed (especially Hugh Grants character) but still they're so human that most of them resemble somebody you know if not yourself.The love affair between Bridgets mother and this TV shop host is  hilarious to say the least - but still there is a human angle on the whole thing. There's a wonderful scene when the mother returns to the father hoping for forgiveness. It's film making at its best.But the real gem in this movie is off course Renee Zellweger - she's just perfectly cast as the vulnerable and unconfident Bridget Jones. You can't help sympatizing a lot with her character - she's so genuine, so sweet, so real - so fantastic. I cannot imagine one single other actress that could have been better in this role. And you can bring them all: Julia Roberts, Meg Ryan, Cameron Diaz, etc. etc..

I will also admit on many a truly sad single night to have sung a long to a ballad or too with a glass of something...ahem! Now, happily married, I can safely relive those awkward and painful moments of singledom safe in the knowledge that Bridget's own happy ending is around the corner for her, ... and wanting her just the way she is!

U.S. GDP falls sharply due to Bridget Jones,"The U.S. Gross Domestic Product fell 0.4% during the period ending Sept 30, 2001; a good deal of this can be attributed, I believe, to those of us ostensibly normal, usually productive women who have become obsessed--yes, obsessed!--with ""Bridget Jones's Diary."" I myself watch this flick at least once a week--let's see, that's 97 minutes multiplied by 52 weeks--84 hours a year--an entire two-week vacation, and that's not counting the time we spend thinking about it, and talking about it, and writing about it. If our husband's snoring wakes us in the middle of the night, we just hop out of bed and go watch the culminating KISS, or perhaps even the entire video; when this happens, we barely can function the next day at work. Our productivity is falling like the Leonid meteors.What is wrong with us?! Maybe it's that we can't deal with the terrorist crisis and must find a means of escape. If so, this little darling of a movie is perfect escapist fare for silly, romantic women like us.Here we have Bridget Jones--our alter ego--encountering our perfect hero--a man who's ""moral and noble and normal...and helpful in the kitchen."" And after many misunderstandings and missteps, at last he clasps us in his arms and bestows on us--um, I meant on HER--the most perfect, exquisite series of kisses in movie history. Omigosh! They're not your standard slobbery, predatory kisses of a male motivated by lust, but the tender and ardent kisses of a man fired by true love.So we crawl back into bed with our husbands, our own true lovers--who are starting to look better and better to us in our altered state of being--resulting in more lost sleep all 'round, and now our poor husbands' job productivity is affected as well.This film is practically subversive.

"Funny, original movie with great acting","There are many things that make this a great movie, but probably the biggest of them all is the acting. Colin Firth and Hugh Grant appear to be perfect for their respective roles, and they do a great job. But Renée Zellweger shines and gives one of the two best female performances of the year (along with Julianne Moore of HANNIBAL (9/10)). This movie is especially great because it gives us a female lead that isn't a gorgeous supermodel and has her share of flaws, but we still love her. Renée Zellweger played the role perfectly.This is also one of the more original films this year. It also is not too predictable. At times it is predictable, but until later in the movie, I honestly did not know which of the two men she would choose from. The movie is also very funny, as I laughed out loud more than one time during this movie. (Which is more than I can say about the ""comedy"" ZOOLANDER (3/10))Highly recommended. And if Renée Zellweger isn't at least nominated for the Best Actress Oscar, I will be sincerely surprised.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Almost perfect comedy and really heart warming,"Surely, there is a Bridget Jones in all of us! At least I can certainly recognize myself in a lot of the things she says, thinks and does. This movie manages to be heart warming without getting too sugary and still it doesn't lack guts! We have love, hate, disappointment, excitement and a fist-fight. There are some scenes that are absolutely hilarious (like Zellwegers tv-debut in a fire station and the ""Tarts & vicars party"") and others that are touching or heartbreaking (look at Zellweger's face when she finds another woman in Hugh Grant's bathroom). Every member in the cast is perfect. Grant plays a manipulative yet very charming creep, and does it well. It's a long way from ""Four weddings..."" where he was the one who had a sort of Bridget Jones-character to play. You DO however understand why Bridget is attracted to him. Colin Firth is the straight-laced lawyer who develops a crush for Bridget early on (if not at first), but have great difficulties to express his feelings. A character like his isn't easy to put across and might become a bore in the wrong hands. It is a great strength of Mr Firth that he conveys a sort of boyish awkwardness and lack of confidence instead of inducing yawns. Smaller parts are equally well cast with a few stand-outs, like Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent as her parents and James Callis as her gay friend. But finally there is Zellweger and she is perfect in her part! Absolutely amazing performance. You root for her all the way because you always feel she is so HUMAN. She makes foolish mistakes and put her foot in her mouth on quite a few occasions, but who hasn't? She is sweet, funny and a fighter. And she is in every single scene in the movie(except for a few funny ones during the end-credits) and yet I didn't spot a single false note in her performance. Academy-award stuff, really! If the movie has one small fault it is that a few scenes tend to drag a bit and are not as funny as they could have been. I also think that too many of the minor characters were reduced to clichés, but i have to admit that I probably wouldn't have laughed as much if it had been otherwise. All in all, a treat!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
