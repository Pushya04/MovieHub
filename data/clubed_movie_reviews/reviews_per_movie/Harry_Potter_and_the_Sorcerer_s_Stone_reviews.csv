The major start of all the magic!,"Having read the first few Harry Potter books before 2001 and hearing about the hype for the first movie, I was excited. I heard there was going to be an all-British cast (which makes sense, right?) and we'd get to see a live version of one of the defining novels of our generation. From what I remember I went with my family and a family friend to see the movie the day after Christmas and was pleasantly amazed. After the movie was over, I watched the credits and discovered some familiar names (the late Alan Rickman, Sister Act's Maggie Smith, James Bond 007's Robbie Coltrane, and Star Wars' Warwick Davis); others not so familiar (the kids, some of whom had their debut). But it was a good movie and was a party of colors and sights for all to see. This is easily my favorite of all the Harry Potter films. The catalyst of the movie series!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Wonderful adaptation, but missing the satire of the book","I enjoyed this movie immensely. But, like ""The Phantom Menace,"" I've had a very hard time viewing it objectively. There was so much anticipation leading up to its release, I simply enjoyed the experience of being there. Having read all four books in the series a few times each, I am overly familiar with the events in the story. As I watched the movie, my continuing thought was ""How well will the next part of the story be translated to the screen?"" rather than ""How entertaining is this film overall?"" I have trouble answering the latter question because I was already entertained by watching a wonderful story dramatized, so I'll never know how I'd have reacted had I seen this movie without having read the books.Critics talk about how incredibly faithful the movie is to the book, and perhaps I'd have had an easier time detaching the two in my mind had the movie set off on its own course. Indeed, many classic children's movies, like ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Mary Poppins,"" are so successful partly because they're so different from the books that inspired them. But these are exceptions; in my experience, most children's movies reveal their weaknesses in how they diverge from the books upon which they're based. And much of what makes the Harry Potter phenomenon unique is that it is the first time in ages that a children's book, without a movie accompanying it, has generated this much popularity. According to an article I read a year ago, the universe of Harry Potter has become as real in the minds of youngsters and adults as that of a popular movie series like Star Wars. Therefore, it will be very hard for any film based upon it to compete with it. In the minds of die-hard fans, any changes made to the story will be seen as desecrating the fantasy world that Rowling created. That's why it's easy to understand why the filmmakers were so reluctant to change anything.As a faithful rendering of the book squeezed into a two-and-a-half hour period, the movie is beautifully done. I don't have a single complaint about any of the actors, who successfully bring to life, with the aid of costume design and special effects, the many colorful characters from the book. My favorite character, the giant Hagrid, is played by Robbie Coltrane, and I say with no exaggeration that he is exactly how I imagined him while reading the book. It's as if they took the image in my mind and transferred it to the screen. While I had my own personal image of Snape (for some reason, I always imagined him as the head villain from another Chris Columbus film, ""Adventures in Babysitting""), Alan Rickman is perfect in the role. I usually expect to have words of criticism for some performances, but I just don't. The remaining adult actors, including Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall and Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, are as good as they possibly could be, and the kids do an excellent job of holding their own against these veterans. Some have criticized Daniel Radcliffe for appearing too subdued in the title role, but that's exactly how the character is portrayed in the book: modest, unassuming, and laid-back. The kids who play Harry's two best friends are flawless.I had a lot of worries about the fact that it was being directed by Chris Columbus, whose entire directorial career so far has consisted of over-the-top slapstick films. I was pleasantly surprised that he did not direct the Harry Potter film in this way. Except for brief moments like the children's delayed reaction to a giant three-headed dog they encounter and Harry's swallowing the quaffle ball, there is nothing here to remind us that this film is directed by the same person who gave us films like ""Home Alone"" and ""Mrs. Doubtfire."" Indeed, I think Columbus may have gone just a tad bit too far in trying not to make the film seem cartoony. I would have liked to see a little more emotion on the actors' faces at certain times. Overall, however, his restraint works nicely in giving the film the kind of believability the book possesses.But much is left out. Harry's caretaker Uncle Vernon, a prominent character in the book, is given less attention in the movie than some of the bit characters. The gently satirical aspects of Hogwarts School aren't in the movie at all. We never see the ghostly history teacher who died several years back but kept on teaching. Lines like the following--""Professor McGonagall watched [her students] turn a mouse into a snuffbox--points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers""--find no equivalent in the movie. The movie does include platform nine-and-three-quarters, though the way the kids disappear into the wall isn't as mysterious as I had visualized, and the sorting hat is there, minus the great poem explaining the differences between the four schools.Not that I'm blaming the movie for omitting some details. Some things from the book would not have translated easily to the screen, and it would have been very difficult to stick everything in. Had Columbus done so and allowed the film to be as long as necessary (eight hours, maybe?), like a BBC miniseries, the film might have been a masterpiece, but few kids would ever have had the patience or attention span to sit through it.The problem is that the amusing details are much of what make Harry Potter such a special story. A whole universe is created in Rowling's series, in which a magical society exists within our own ordinary ""muggle"" world and is kept secret by a bureaucracy with its own rules, history and politics. The way magic is treated in her books, not as something medieval but as very similar to the way our own contemporary world works, is a large part of their charm. Take away these details, and you're left with a fairly conventional tale of a young wizard fighting an evil sorcerer.Although the audience I was with broke into applause as soon as the movie ended (something I've never seen happen before, though I don't go to the theater that often), some people have complained about the movie dragging at certain points. I didn't have that problem, but, as I said, I wasn't really trying to get involved in the movie's story. After thinking about it, it does seem like parts of the movie fail to convey a sense of urgency. Why should this be? I never felt that way when reading the books, and this is without a doubt the very same story.The answer, I think, is that the books portray much of Harry's anxiety in trying to succeed in school (for if he's kicked out, he'll go straight back to his horrible uncle) and fit in with the kids there. The movie doesn't tap into these anxieties enough, so why should we care whether he wins the Quidditch match (other than that he survives in one piece) and gets through the school year? The only real suspense in the movie after he arrives at Hogwarts comes from the story of Lord Voldemort returning, which in the book is almost secondary. Harry's adventures getting along in the school are fun and interesting, but as they are presented to us in the film, there isn't enough tying them all together.What we have here is a serviceable dramatization of a wonderful children's series, but it doesn't entirely succeed in standing on its own. Perhaps it should have diverged from the book just a little, to compensate for the difficulties in translating some of the book's delights to the screen. In its current form, it's almost like a preview of the book. Its lack of fullness, and its dependence on the book, might actually increase the popularity and endurance of Rowling's series by making those who see the film yearn for more, which they can get from the real thing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Better Than Anticipated,"Like a lot of others, I refused to watch this film when it was originally released, thinking it was going to be another movie for kids, loosely taken from the source. Was I ever wrong?J.K. Rowling's novel was brilliantly taken from book to screen. The acting, directing and especially the special effects were tremendously awesome. Director Chris Columbus did a superb job with the direction, I was surprised he didn't get an Academy Award nomination. The acting was too, excellent, especially from the experienced actors like Alan Rickman playing Severus Snape. Truly one of his best performances.A great adaptation of a very popular book, a fine example of cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
There's nothing like the first,"There's nothing like the first in a series, is there? The introduction to the characters, the immersion into the fictional world, the first time you laugh, cry, care, and fear for someone's safety can never be repeated. No matter how many Harry Potter movies they crank out, or if they ever remake them in the future, none will come close to the wonderful first film, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.I'm sure everyone has their own childhood memories of reading the Harry Potter books that they'll tell their grandkids about, but I'll never forget going to see the first movie in the theaters. The lights dimmed, John Williams's perfect theme played its first notes as Richard Harris walked down Privet Drive, and everyone in the theater was transported to another world. John Williams's numerous themes, all wonderful and a personification of the wizarding world, took the early movies to another level. As other composers tried their hands at the later films, that quality was missing. There's something truly special about going to see this movie on the big screen, and while the ""magical"" qualities might not all be credited to the music, it's certainly one of them.Welcome to the world of Harry Potter, where if you're a ten-year-old kid who doesn't fit in, you might get a letter delivered by an owl telling you you have magical powers and should go to a special school to hone them. Believe it or not, there are people who watch this movie without reading the books, so a bit of description is necessary. Obviously the stars of the show are the children, who were selected out of millions of other kids to be able to memorize lines, not look in the camera, endear themselves to worldwide audiences, and hopefully act. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and Tom Felton are so cute and tiny in this first movie, you'll undoubtedly find yourself re-watching it as the years pass just to see them as kids again. I always marvel that child actors train themselves not to look in the camera, so even if their performances aren't perfect, I cut them slack, knowing firsthand how hard it is. And these kids had to dress in funny costumes, recite incantations without laughing, and pretend they're looking at things that were added in post production!Usually, in kids' movies, there's a grown-up or two who add to the cast and make the adult audience members feel less silly that they're watching it. In the Harry Potter movies, everyone wanted to be in them! Throughout the series you'll see a host of familiar faces as ""guest stars"" but the regulars will make special places in your heart. Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Robbie Coltrane are household names for little kids, because they're so convincing as the kindhearted Dumbledore, the wizened but sentimental McGonagall, the endlessly mimicable Snape, and the jolly Hagrid, kids today can't imagine they've had any other career prior to these movies! Is there any kid who doesn't immediately attribute the word ""earwax"" to Richard Harris, point out striped cats as ""Maggie Smith cats"", mumble ""Shouldn't have said that,"" when they make a mistake, or practice putting pauses in their sentences like Alan Rickman?First movies are so special, since they introduce audiences to a world that will hopefully capture their attention for however many more movies will be made. In J.K. Rowling's fantasy world, there's so much to fall in love with; and in the film adaptation you can really believe it exists. Seeing the Hogwarts structure for the first time creates a special feeling in your heart that can only be recaptured by watching the movie again or going to see the next in the series. The Great Hall, Quidditch, the Sorting Hat, talking portraits, flying lessons, selecting the perfect wand-all these Harry Potter moments are perfectly recreated in the first of a series that saw an entire generation grow up buying toy wands and trying Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.Each installment has its special moments, and this first one has quite a few, even outside of the exposition. If a three-headed dog doesn't immediately conjure the name ""Fluffy,"" chess pieces have never come to life in your imagination, you don't laugh at the idea of counting your birthday presents, and you don't know what Richard Harris wants most in the world, you're missing out on one of the great joys in life. If somehow 2001 passed you by without a trip to the movie theaters Thanksgiving weekend, go find yourself a copy of this iconic, lovely movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Magic Comes To Life!,"Once upon a time (and not that long ago), in the vivid, fertile imagination of author J.K. Rowling, a character was born:  A boy.  A young boy named Harry, who was destined to become one of the most beloved characters to emerge from a work of fiction in a long, long time, and was quickly embraced by young and old alike in all corners of the world.  And now, thanks to the magic of the cinema, Harry and his companions fairly leap from the pages of the novel to the silver screen in the phenomenal motion picture, `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' directed by Chris Columbus and written for the screen by Steve Kloves.  Indeed, Harry Potter is a boy, but not just any boy; because Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) just happens to be a wizard.  But, orphaned as a baby, Harry has been raised by his Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and Uncle Vernon Dursley (Richard Griffiths), who never let him in on the fact that he was, well-- what he was.  It seems that Petunia didn't approve of her own sister-- Harry's mother-- because she was a witch; nor of Harry's father because he, too, was a wizard.  When Harry turns eleven, however, the secret is out of the bag when-- after some strange goings-on-- a giant of a man named Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) shows up at the Dursley's door to collect Harry and take him off to `Hogwarts,' a school for wizards and witches and all who would perfect the gift with which they were born:  The gift of magic!  And from the moment Harry boards the train (from station platform nine-and-three-quarters) that will take him to his destiny, the magic is alive-- for Harry, and for the audience, as well; and it's a journey you will never forget.What a monumental undertaking to even think of attempting-- translating and transferring this passionately beloved work from novel to the screen. Because to millions of people, Harry and his companions are so much more than merely characters in a book; these are characters for whom people have made a special place in their hearts, which puts a great burden of trust upon the man who would attempt to bring them to life.  And Chris Columbus, it turns out, was the right man for the job.  More than rising to the occasion and with some magic of his own-- and a lot of help from an extraordinarily talented cast and crew-- Columbus has delivered a film that is not only true to the story, but true to the very spirit that makes Harry Potter so special.  The special effects are absolutely beyond astounding, and Columbus, with a keen eye for detail and without missing a beat, keeps it all on track and moving right along at a pace and with a sense of timing that makes this an absorbing, thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable experience from beginning to end.  From the opening frame you get the feeling that you're about to have a singular experience; and you're right. Because you've just entered the world of Harry Potter.  And it's magic.Even having the best special effects do not a great movie make, however, and this film is no exception; what catapults this one to the top are the performances, beginning with Radcliffe, whom you quickly forget is an actor playing a part.  And that about sums up what kind of a job this young man does here.  Without question, he IS Harry Potter, physically and emotionally, and when he waves his wand and does what he does, you believe it.  A wonderful performance by a gifted actor who has a great career ahead of him; without question the perfect choice for the role of Harry.Also turning in excellent performances are Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson as Hermione.  As with Radcliffe, the casting here could not have been more perfect.  Grint is `Everyboy,' with that special glint in his eye and a manner that makes him especially endearing.  And the spunky Watson adds some real sparkle to the film as Hermione, the one with the sense of urgency and the wherewithal to get things done; a real role model for young girls everywhere.It's obvious that a lot of care went into the casting of this film, and it's a big part of why it is so successful.  Richard Harris, as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore; Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall; John Hurt as Mr. Ollivander; Ian Hart as Professor Quirrell.  Exceptional performances from one and all, with two that stand out as especially memorable:  Robbie Coltrane, who readily conveys the fact that Hagrid's heart is of a size that matches that of the man; and Alan Rickman, as Professor Severus Snape, deliciously droll while demonstrating menace through the fine art of articulation.The additional supporting cast includes John Cleese (Nearly Headless Nick), Warwick Davis (Professor Flitwick), Julie Walters (Mrs. Weasley), Zoe Wanamaker (Madame Hooch), Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy), Harry Melling (Dudley) and David Bradley (Filch).  From Rowling's imagination to the written page to real life (albeit via the movie screen), `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is a triumph many times over; a unique film of truly universal appeal, the likes of which is as rare as, well-- a sorcerer's stone.  A film in which adults and children alike will rejoice, because it speaks to the heart in a universal language of life, love, experience and imagination; a film that states unequivocally that magic exists-- as long as there's a single child with a single dream somewhere in the world, and real wizards like J.K. Rowling, Chris Columbus, Steve Kloves and every member of this wonderful cast and crew around to bring it to life as they have here.  An instant classic in every sense of the word, this is truly a film for the ages.  A remarkable achievement, this IS the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
As good an adaption as could ever be expected,"To be faced with the challenge of adapting Harry Potter for the Silver screen must have been any director's nightmare- the chance of directing possibly the biggest film of this decade, but also the hardest audience-the millions of fans of the book who know every line and will pick up on every mistake. Being one of the above, I can only say that Christopher Columbus and all of the team working on HP did marvelously. The cast was brilliant (particularly notable are Alan Rickman as Snape, Maggie Smith as McGonagall, and the eerily creepy David Bradley as Argus Filch), the directing wonderful, and the scenery perfect. The only qualm is that it does not track perfectly with the book, but squeezed into 2.5 hours, this can only be expected. Well done all involved!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Nice beginning to an amazing saga,"The right way to start a saga like this one, introducing the characters in a very positive and unique way, telling and showcasing all the riches that the wizard's world is a home of.

Epic film,"Ah, the first film adaptation of the beloved Harry Potter series. Harry Potter is an 11-year-old boy who comes to find out that he is a wizard. He lives with his uncaring Muggle (non magic) aunt, uncle, and cousin since his parents died when he was a baby. They were murdered by a dark and powerful evil wizard named Lord Voldemort. Harry would be dead too, but was miraculously saved, making him something of a legend. Upon learning of his guarded magic roots, Harry gets enrolled in Hogwarts- a British school for witches and wizards. While there he learns to come into his own, meet people that are actually good to him, and learn more of his dark past. Looking back, I don't know if it was a good idea to have Chris Columbus direct this, as he does have a reputation for being something of a hack, albeit a decent one. I think his direction is okay here. Yeah, retrospectively it could have been better, but it could also have been much worse. At least with him at the helm we get a good amount of whimsy to go along with a bit of menace, and that's a good thing, as the book was likewise not too heavy on the darker stuff (though that sure changed as time went on). Many liberties are taken, which is weird since the book is quite short, and the film is two and a half hours. It does get the point across decently enough though, and also works as a piece for those unfamiliar with the source material. John Williams provides great music, there's wonderful art direction and set design, and there's some nifty set pieces too. Featuring an all-British cast, this film is impeccably cast, and the performances are good too. Finding decent child actors is hard, but they really scored here. My enjoyment of this movie has waned over time, but it's still not a terrible piece of work by any means, so check it out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Valiant, successful attempt to bring the magic to life","We live in a world where economics is hard. This forces practical limitations when making a movie. Time and money are sadly finite, cinema owners need to be pleased as well as fans and computer animation ain't perfect. Given these limitations, this film is about as close to human perfection as it is possible to achieve. However, it's extremely clear what an immense challenge it is to turn Philosopher's Stone from book to film.Two and a half hours is not long to explore a wonderful, magical world. Furthermore, the directors have bowed to the inevitable temptation to show us things that cannot be communicated so effectively in a book. The consequence is the feeling of a slightly breathless sprint in places.It also means that the movie has to stay true to the spirit of the book rather than to the letter of it. There are omissions and there are changes. The changes that were made capture and maintain the spirit of the story really well; indeed, there are places where the story is more clearly and straightforwardly told in the movie than in the book. Some aspects of the story are fleshed out on screen and the additions are delightful, completely in keeping with the flavour of the world.The humour of the movie is inevitably more visual than that of the book; no belly laughs, but a lot of smiles. Some punchlines have changed, but the reasons why the jokes are funny remain the same. Not knowing exactly what's coming next is a good thing! It's all kept tasteful, classy and above the belt; there's nothing to cringe about.The voice acting is almost uniformly brilliant. However, there are occasions where some of the actors are required to convey high emotions and are only given a second or two of face shot, or head-and-shoulders shot, to do so. This isn't as much freedom as they need and they fall a little short. The blame here must fall on the decision to give the actors too much to do too quickly, not on the actors themselves.Other than these rare jarring instances, the physical acting is frequently excellent and seldom less than completely adequate, judged against the highest of targets set by the book's clear emotion descriptions.Dan Radcliffe has the look, the mannerisms and the charm of Harry down pat. His strongest expressions are the bemusement that must be inherent at entering a world where science does not rule alone and the bravery that Harry shows in his achievements. Emma Watson possibly slightly overplays Hermione, but does so in a fully endearing fashion. There's one scene which gives her too little chance to truly express panic; otherwise her performance needs no changes.Rupert Grint has comic timing way beyond his years, hitting Ron's lines perfectly. Tom Felton makes a stylish Draco; Matt Lewis' Neville character suffers from the acceleration, so the finale does come as a slight characterisation shock.The Phelps brothers' Fred and George are distinctively cheeky rather than proactive pranksters; Chris Rankin imbues Percy with genuine authority. Sean Biggerstaff shines; his Oliver Wood is likeable and an ideal Quidditch team captain.Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid is the single dominant adult character, with maximum laughs extracted at every step. The movie changes strongly exaggerate one side of Hagrid's nature, though; probably inevitable considering how much plot exposition his character has.David Bradley has a vicious Argus Filch; John Hurt's Ollivander is an eccentric treat, giving a wonderful introduction to the Wizarding World. The professors are uniformly excellent, though Richard Harris' Dumbledore comes off as disappointingly flat until the end.The most ambitious point of the movie is the computer generated imagery. The stills are wonderful, but the fastest animation is restricted by the limitations of real-world technology. The book makes extremely stringent demands of the CGI; sometimes their overall effect in the movie is merely good rather than insanely great. Some of the magic spells and effects look awesome; others don't capture the imagination nearly so much.The world cannot yet completely convincingly animate human beings doing inhuman things, which serves as a clear reminder that you need fictional magic to make the impossible possible. The Quidditch scene is the most demanding of them all; while the sequence is action-packed and good-looking, disappointingly, it's not a total success. Perhaps some of the scenes would have been better with more conventional special effects? (For instance, the lower-tech-looking Sorting Hat scene is one of the most delightful of them all.)The set looks gorgeous. However, it may not stand up to detailed analysis. It's fairly obvious that things are shot in many disparate locations, rather than one big Hogwarts School near Hogsmeade.The score is absolutely wonderful. The soundtrack may rely too heavily on The Famous Bit, but it's clear that the balance and mixture of things in the finished movie are exactly right.The feel of the whole movie is everything fans could have hoped for. The dialogue is intensely measured, the colouring is suitably epic, the selection of what to leave in is really tightly considered. You get chills in your spine at the right places; you feel the triumphs as all-encompassing endorphin highs. It's clear that the production have thought long, hard and lovingly. They are true fans of the story, they are the right people for the job, it all bodes very well for the second film.So it could never have been the film that the hyper-literalists were hoping for, then, but it is as good as the practicalities of the real world could possibly permit. Don't expect miracles and you'll love it. I look forward to watching it again and again.8/10 at the very least. A really satisfactory film!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

"It's a true adaptation, but lacks an edge like the novel. *** (out of four)","HARRY POTTER / (2001) *** (out of four)Here's a method of evaluating a movie based on previously published material: ask yourself if the film makes you want to read the material from which it is based?Before the release of ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"" I was one of the few remaining souls who had not read J.K. Rowling's fantasy book series. After screening the first film installment, I did want to read the book. Borrowing the novel from a family member, I briefly skimmed over the chapters. The book's intelligence and similarities with the film really surprised me.With over 100 million copies sold in over 46 different languages, J.K. Rowling's best-selling series of books has become a worldwide phenomenon. Naturally, with soaring expectations abound, the filmmakers felt great pressure to create a faithful adaptation. They have. This film is essentially a visualization of the words in the novel, with very few differences.That said, the film does run into a few conflicts with the book's story. The middle of the movie has nowhere to go. It's like a false second act; almost nothing of major significance occurs in this period of the film. The young characters wander from scene to scene with nothing much to do and nothing much to say. We're left with a grand display of eye-popping special effects.""Harry Potter"" certainly dazzles us with a solid beginning and an engaging final act, however. We first meet a young wizard boy named Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe). Soon after the film opens, the boy discovers he has magical powers. He's then thrust into an enchanting world of sorcery, magic, and witchcraft. He's sent to a school for young wizard children, where he meets new friends, learns about magic, and participates in fun competitions. But someone at the school doesn't like Harry, as mysterious events begin to occur. Harry soon finds himself in the middle of a diabolical scheme of revenge. Who is the culprit and what do they want with Harry?The film asks some involving questions. Too bad it doesn't give enough depth to the side characters or subplots. We don't really care about the mystery because we don't know enough about the suspects. The movie does conclude with a twist, but it doesn't encourage another examination of the movie. It lacks a foundation altogether. The story spends so much time foreshadowing the villain's identity, it is pointless for the story to abandon its proceeding plot points and develop a new villain at the end. The book gets away with this; the movie does not.After his gentle ""Home Alone"" and sweet-natured ""Stepmom,"" many questioned the ability of director Chris Columbus to bring a sense of darkness to the story-and for good reason. ""Harry Potter"" contains charming, likable characters and a rich pallet of lush, inventive images. Unfortunately, the film lacks an edge. It's missing the dark atmosphere Rowling's novel so vividly brought to life. Columbus does construct some memorable sequences, but the individual scenes themselves are much better than the movie as a whole.Despite it's childish story and pre-teen characters, many define ""Harry Potter"" as a film for all ages. While that's debatable, during my screening, adults were plowing through the isles every five minutes. Going to the bathroom? Getting drink refills? Buying concessions? Who knows? But not a single child budged from their seat. Their eyes were glued to the big screen.Conclusion: It's a sure-fire experience for children, especially if they've read the books. But adults may not encounter the same enticement as kids. Then again, if I had nothing better to do than to count the people leaving the theater, why am I recommending the film?",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
An effects-laden excuse of an adaptation,"Many viewers of this film applaud its faithfulness to the book, however they miss that while the film includes much of the book in it (more than is necessary in fact), it lacks the central story.  That is:  the story of a young boy who has suddenly had his wildest dream come true, and who now must deal with his newfound celebrity, his amazing magical heritage, and most of all, day to day life at Hogwarts with his friends (and enemies).  The movie is more preoccupied with populating Hogwarts with ghosts and moving staircases than it is with characters of any depth.  Everyone from the book, Harry included, suffers from a serious lack of on-screen development, and as a consequence the story lurches  ponderously from event to event without the throughline that stong character development would bring.

Pure cinematic magic,"To millions of children of all ages, November 16 has been more eagerly anticipated than Christmas, as the long-awaited film version of J. K. Rowling's beloved novel ""Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone"" hits the screen.Each of Rowling's four Harry Potter books have been critically acclaimed worldwide best-sellers, turning a generation of video-game playing children into avid readers.In translating Rowling's world of wizards and magic to the screen, the film makers claimed to be intensely aware of the fans' high expectations and had sworn to be faithful to the book.""Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone"" is indeed the most loyal film adaptation of a book that this fan has ever seen.It's the story of an orphaned boy who discovers on his eleventh birthday that his parents were wizards and that he is in fact a famous and powerful wizard himself.Released from the clutches of his desperately ordinary (and non-magical) Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia - and their deliciously obnoxious son Dudley - Harry takes his place in the wizarding world as a first year student at the venerated Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.A great deal of ""Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone"" is an introduction to this fantastic and dangerous world and its richly drawn characters. There's not only a lot of plot to cover in this film, but an entire world to create.At two and a half hours long (hit the restroom before it starts), the film includes the book's most memorable scenes, bringing many of them to life with pure cinematic wizardry.The Quidditch match (a soccer/hockey/rugby thing played on broomsticks) is much more exciting on the screen than on the page, as is the bathroom battle with an enormous mountain troll and the larger-than-life game of wizard's chess.The frightening aspects of the book are in full force in the film, and its PG rating (for some scary moments) should be taken seriously.Screenwriter Steven Kloves (""Wonder Boys"") has done a fine job of streamlining Rowling's tale while maintaining its spirit. Director Chris Columbus (""Home Alone"") makes good on his promise to be faithful to the book. But at times the film is a bit too reverent; you want the actors to cut loose and have a bit more fun.Columbus clearly understands that fantasy works best when it's played most real. Across the board, his fine ensemble of actors are so perfectly cast that they appear to have literally stepped out of Rowling's book.In the title role, Daniel Radcliffe pulls off the very difficult task of playing an introverted hero who spends most of the movie reacting to the amazing sights and events around him. He beautifully captures the deep soul and untapped potential of Harry Potter. And when this kid smiles the screen lights up.Rupert Grint is delightful as Harry's sardonic buddy Ron Weasley and Emma Watson nearly steals the film as their overachieving friend Hermione Granger. Three cheers to the film makers for giving three unknown child actors the top billing they deserve.The strong cast of veteran actors includes Richard Harris as the wise Headmaster Dumbledore and Robbie Coltrane as the lovable giant Hagrid. Alan Rickman is wonderfully villainous as Professor Snape and Zoe Wanamaker has just the right touch of girls gym teacher as flying instructor Madame Hooch.As the strict but just Professor McGonagall, Oscar winner Maggie Smith seems born to play the role - and is ready for another Oscar.John Cleese (as Nearly Headless Nick) and Julie Walters (as Mrs. Weasley) have all-too-brief cameo roles, but if the next film ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" remains true to the book, we'll be seeing more of them.In addition to being highly engaging, the film is a marvelous thing to look at. From the bustling wizard street Diagon Alley to the magnificently gothic Hogwarts School to the dark and misty Forbidden Forest, the film breaks new ground in imaginative production design.To paraphrase the film's tagline, let the magic (and box office records) begin.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Review,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a film directed by Chris Columbus. For many years, I hadn't given a damn about the Harry Potter series. But seeing the fanfare surrounded by the series, I decided to give it a try. After watching this one, I can definitely say that I am on the verge of being a fan.Plot: Harry Potter, an orphan living with his uncle and his family is invited to Hogwarts School of Magic to become a wizard.Story and direction: I had watched this part around the time it released but never just kept in touch since I didn't understand a word. Seeing it now as an adult and a movie lover, I just fell in love with this fictional world created. The characters, settings, story, etc.. all just feel seamless. Thanks to J K Rowling, Steve Kloves and Chris Columbus who have done justice to the source material provided to them. I feel the themes are so very relevant in this film. The intricacies of those themes are valid in the current world we do live in. This is what I just exactly want from any story presented to me. Although the film is very long, I never felt bored for a single moment. And to adapt quite a huge novel comes with responsibility and precaution, which the makers completely justified. The sets are huge and awesome. You just feel you are in Hogwarts actually. Also each characters costume is just to marvel at. John Williams once again just proves why he is the composer of the century. But I did feel some flaws to the film. Being a first film, the main plot of the film comes at around the 90th minute of the film. Also the VFX of the film felt very amateur considering some great VFX was done in the years preceding this film.Performances: I would say that the casting of the film is just perfect. Applause for the casting team is deserved. Never do you feel that another actor should play the role. The kids, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Tom Felon just to name a few are fantastic. These 10-11 year old just steal your heart. Also the other cast like Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane make themselves likable.Favorite Scene: There were many favourite scenes in this film for me. But one scene in particular was the troll scene where Harry and Ron decide to save Hermione and after the saving Hermione vouches for the boys. This is the scene where you actually happen to see the bond solidified between the 3 as friends.Verdict: For anyone who just loves fantasy film and worlds with great visuals, this film is just for you. I assure you won't be disappointed. I plan on seeing the entire series now because I am fascinated by this world and want to see what else has it got to offer.I am going with an 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Great fun!,"I really liked this film, but I much prefer the book, which has a lot more magic and wonder. Daniel Radcliffe is very likable as Harry, and he is given solid support by a funny Rupert Grint and a good Emma Watson, though she was annoying at times. The scene stealer was definitely Robbie Coltrane; I actually can't imagine anyone else playing Hagrid, Coltrane was just hilarious. Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith were also great, but for me the standout was the late Richard Harris. Now I much prefer Harris's interpretation of Dumbledore. He was soft-spoken, and actually fitted the part better. Both of these qualities were lost in the interpretation that Michael Gambon gave. I am not saying that Michael Gambon was bad, he just wasn't my ideal choice for Harris's replacement. The film is fairly faithful to its source material, and looks very beautiful. However, it is a bit long, and very young children may find Voldemort too frightening. I know because I have triplet brother and sisters who saw it, and couldn't sleep for about a month after viewing. In conclusion, a very good film, well performed and quite dark. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
It was brilliant!,"When I knew the film was being made, I thought how could they make a film that would be up to the standard of such a perfect book. But they did! Sure they missed bits out but they captured the essence of the book brilliantly. One member of the cast was mis-cast for me but my children disagreed.I even found myself believing they were flying and not wondering ""how are they doing that?"" So 10 out 10 Warner Brothers.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"That's it! I give up! I surrender! White flag! My friends want to see the new Harry Potter that is about to be released this summer, The Order of Phoenix, but they looked at my like I just lost my head when I told them I never saw the Harry Potter films. They just said I've seen every movie yet I never saw Harry Potter? Well, I never saw the point since I don't read the books or wasn't interested in the films, it looked like typical kid's stuff to me. But my friends said they would not take me to see the movie until I've seen the films, it's now that I realize I got myself into trouble since these movies are all 2+ hours each. I just finished the first one a couple days ago.Harry Potter lives with an extremely cruel family, but there is something different about him, he can talk to snakes and make things appear and disappear. Well, he receives a letter, he's a wizard! Not just any wizard, he is the only wizard ever to survive the wrath of Voldemort, the most wicked wizard. Harry goes to a magical school, Hogwarts, where he learns the truth of his heroic parents and meets two other wizards, Ron and Hermione who soon become his best friends and they discover the power of the sorcerer's stone and what might happen if it's put into the wrong hands.Harry Potter I have to admit is off to a good start with me, it had wonderful and magical effects that anyone could enjoy. The actors were just so perfectly cast, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, John Cleese, we have some of England's most brilliant actors. It's a well made film, now I still haven't read the books, so I can't base this film on a comparison. Even if I did, this is the movie and the movie itself is a magical and enchanting experience. Well, I'm onto The Chamber of Secrets, wish me luck.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
the beginning of one of the beloved saga the world.,"in 2001, in the film Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, began one of the best sagas of all time, based on the book of the same name by JK Rowling, the film hit full in the cast, all actors are great in their characters, Daniel Radcliffe this impeccable as Harry Potter, the resemblance is too large, Rupert Grint this great as Ron Weasley, Emma excellent Watson as Hermione Granger, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, Richard Harris as Dumbledore (which unfortunately from the third movie substituted series, having deceased), Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman great as Snape, Ian Hart, Tom Felton, and etc, all goods, the special effects are great, the picture is great, especially the castles, the soundtrack is very good, and full of great moments, as the final, obvious that the movie has errors, the script has some problems, and the film is very long, I think it was longer than it should, and the film is faithful to the book, even with some missing characters, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a very good film, and marks the beginning of the saga of the Wizard in the movies.

"With spectacular visuals, likeable characters, and a sense of magic and wonder, The Sorcerer's Stone is still a good first entry after 20 years","During my childhood, the earlier Harry Potter books got me into the franchise and especially Fantasy Literature in general. They had thought provoking writing, likeable characters, and compelling world building. Then I saw this movie adaptation of The Sorcerer's Stone (The Philosopher's Stone in the UK) back in theaters and loved it. It's not a perfect film I'll admit, but it's a very good start to a successful fantasy movie franchise.Sure, it's a bit overlong and the child performances from Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, while not terrible by any means, could have used some fixing though they did get better as the later movies progressed.Everything else still holds up. The visual effects/cinematography are beautiful to look at, the directing from Chris Columbus is great, the make up designs are well built, and the music score from John Williams is enchanting and haunting especially Hedwig's Theme. Not to mention the supporting actors are great with Robbie Coltrane as Harris and the late actors Alan Rickman and Richard Harris as Severus Snape and Professor Dumbledore.Overall, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone isn't perfect but it's a very good start to the successful fantasy movie franchise after 20 years.

First Harrry Potter entry in which he  makes friends and  battles mysterious evil forces,"First episode also known as ¨Harry Potter and the philosopher's stone¨ deal with Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe)and friends fighting dark forces in an amazing adventure . In this early installment of JK Rowling saga, our protagonist is freed by Rubeus from the custody of his selfish uncle (Richard Griffiths) and miserable aunt (Fiona Lewis). Harry goes his destiny at Hogwart's school , there meets our friends Ron(Rupert Grint) ,Hermione(Emma Watson) and his enemies Braco Malfoy(Tom Felton), along the dark forces which threatens Hogwart, and finally Lord Voldemor . Besides the professors as Minerva(Maggie Smith), Severus Snape(Alan Rickman), Dumbledore ( Richard Harris), Madame Hooch (Zoe Wanamaker), Quirinus (Ian Hart)and of course Rubeus(Robbie Coltrane). Here some legendary events take place , including a Quiddich match, and Harry Potter competes in confronting in series of dangerous happenings , challenging monsters as unicorn, centaur and horrible creatures and an ending spooky climatic battle .This episode contains loads of adventures and action and is such deeply riveting and emotional as its followings , furthermore gets lots of bombastic special effects and several images have you on the edge of your seat including an amazing array of technical bizarre creatures, a breathtaking ogre ,a three-head animal , and Potter fighting creepy , scary monsters and an exciting final taking on between Harry and the Dark Lord and his henchmen . The picture displays stimulating action set pieces illuminating the full-blown adventures , blending wizardry, witchcraft, horror, humor and is extremely amusing and pretty enjoyable. Darkest even that subsequent chapters is thrilling, dramatic, touching and very exciting. Provide enough amusement to keep the chat rooms humming until the epic ending comes out . In spite of overlong runtime, it suffers from over-length, and the difficult of adapting, the film still managing to keep a quick enough pace for those unfamiliar with the literary and highly detailed work by J. K. Rowling. The motion picture is splendidly filmed with sensational production design and colorful cinematography by John Seale . Phenomenal and spectacular music by master John Williams. The movie is magnificently directed by Chris Colombus . The film is for Harry Potter saga lovers as well as neophyte who have never read J. K. Rowling novels.

How to take advantage of your children's naivety for the sake of cold cash...,"I have, in all my life as a lover of both literature and the cinema, hardly ever come upon a piece of work more unimaginative, more ugly, more uninteresting, more lacking in suspense, more lacking in charm, more greedy, more incoherent... Okay, okay. I'll stop with the superlative negatives. Surely there have been worse, and, yes, off the top of my head, I can think of many that are worse. However, for a book that over 125 million people have read, and for a movie that cemented the record for the biggest opening weekend in history, and also for a book that has had not only kids but critics singing its praises, and also for a movie which one particularly fat-headed critic called the Wizard of Oz of its generation, I am more than severely disappointed. I know that, had it not been so overhyped, it would have been just as bad. Now, however, my anger for it is completely hardened and it's going to be a passionate battle for me for years to come.I go into an in depth criticism, but it would be impossible for me to keep to 1000 words. There is hardly a piece of it that I liked. As a film, it was poorly edited, poorly acted (by most), poorly filmed. The only really memorable scene is the troll in the bathroom, although the payoff to it makes no sense whatsoever. The Quidditch game, which has been hyped to all heaven, is completely boring and poorly created. It looks like the FX guys created it with photoshop. When the chess game looked like it was about to be the most exciting sequence in the film, Christopher Columbus, who, I must say, lives up to his reputation completely, begins to edit furiously. I heard afterwards that this was done to avoid a PG-13. My immediate thought is that the filmmakers didn't trust their young audience to enjoy watching a chess game, no matter how exciting it might have been. I'm still not sure which story to buy.But the person I really want to tear into is J.K. Rowling. What a hack. Never has the word ""hack"" been more fitting. A former waitress, her idea of imagination is to call things by weird names. Only in the mind of a psychopath (or idiot) could the name Draco Malfoy or a Cerberus clone named Fluffy be considered clever. Writing children's literature is not difficult, but this is simply awful. She's clearly ripping off Raoul Dahl like there's no tomorrow, especially in the exposition. The game of Quidditch, which seems to be a drawing point of some sort, is absolutely nonsensical. As a preteen, I invented much more interesting games with much less interesting playing pieces. Quidditch is a game where people score ten points at a time, unless someone catches a special type of ball, which ends the game immediately. So theoretically, the game could end in thirty seconds. And all the other forms of scoring matter not at all. And let's talk about the surprise climax. Really, anyone could have been standing in front of that mirror at the end. It is tremendously unclever. And the penultimate sequence, where the crown is awarded to the best dorm, is anticlimactic and just rude to the children of Slytherin, We only hate one of them, so why should we be happy that the award at first goes to them, and then is cruelly snatched away. And what about Hogwart, anyways? If you're not supposed to use magic when you're away from Hogwart, why the heck would you want to be a wizard anyways?Friends, you're well on the path to making your children drooling morons. If they want a great series of books about sorcery and magic creatures, make them read the Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis. This is the most soulless garbage imaginable. And I thought Shrek had taken that title. 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Alohomora - of the magical world...,"I watched this movie first time when I was left with no choice. My expectations were extremely low as I always wondered if Harry Potter books were over-hyped. How-ever after watching the movie it did make me a Harry Potter movie fan. And needless to say - this continues to remain my favourite of HP series. That brings to a point here.... the effect of expectations over a movie. True, expectations reduce joy.Without going into the story I would certainly say Chris Columbus churns out a perfect pot-pourri of emotions, suspense and magic, delivering something appealing to all ages.Every character brought to life on screen has done justice and leave an impression on you. Particularly notable performances by Emma Watson and Alan Rickman.CGI are in plenty and made good of. The Quedditch game is picturised amazingly. The wizard's chess is treat to eyes.Let's hope that the forthcoming HP series carries the similar magical touch.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Solid start to a spectacular series,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is the first of eight films based on the seven best selling novels by J.K. Rowling. While I certainly don't think it is one of the better films, it is the one that starts them off and crucially it does so in the right way.The tone of the Philosopher's Stone is considerably lighter than the rest of the series. It is quite childish at times and you never really feel there is any danger. That is a problem because in some scenes you probably should feel a threat. The effects in the series overall are fantastic but in this one they are patchy. The troll, fluffy, the quidditch and Voldemort when he appears all look quite cartoonish.The biggest success of the first HP film is the world building. So many fantasy films throw you straight into a complicated, elaborate plot and spend ages trying to explain what is going on. The result is that you never feel like you have been transported into another world. That is what Chris Columbus got right about this one. The plot here feels, for large parts, less important than introducing the world itself. The focus of the film is primarily on the wonder and magic of the world.The sets and locations are fantastic. Hogwarts, Diagon Alley and Gringotts all look great. The costumes are also stunning and give the film a real vibrancy. The soundtrack from John Williams is iconic. The cast features some of the best British and Irish talent from the last half-century and they all give memorable performances. The kids definitely grow into their roles but I had no problem with any of them here.Some of the later films have far more depth, character development and danger about them but they are allowed to because of the foundations laid in this one. When you see Hogwarts, the owls, etc. in the later films you automatically know it is the Harry Potter world and crucially feel a connection to it. That is the Philosopher's Stone's greatest triumph.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

I was in doubt of whether it really maximized its runtime. There were, in some parts, too many scenes which the characters were doing a lot of dialogues. The production design and costumes were excellent aspects of the film, too. But for me a lot of dark cinematography was utilized, instead of a more lively kind of production.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

""I'm a wizard!"" is said with such indifference you'd think he's not surprised at all. I've never read the books and this film did nothing to make me want to read them. The only spell this cast over me was one to get me out of the room as quickly as possible every time I have seen this on after my first viewing of it in the cinema. If you want to see a decent book made film watch Lord of the Rings or possibly the sequel to this which I thought was actually good. 1/10",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Magically Delicious,"I feel, next to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the best book-to-movie adaptation that I've ever seen. The sets were stunning - the actors were first rate - the effects were breathtaking.  The film flowed quite smoothly in it's transition from page to screen, never tripping on the awkward conventions that other books on film have struggled with.   The screenplay, by Steven Kloves, stripped away all unnecessary elements to get to the root of the story.  Though many events from the book were excluded, the essential ones made it to the film. And it makes for one smooth story and very enjoyable movie-going experience.Many kudos to Chris Columbus and the rest of the Harry Potter cast/crew for not turning this movie into what it easily could have become:  a 2 and a half hour commercial advertisement for action figures and collectibles, kid's meals and fast food tie-ins, soft drinks and snack products, etc. and instead focused on bringing J.K. Rowling's story to life as accurately and as lovingly as it deserves.  There has been much speculation on whether Columbus was the correct choice for the first two installments of the series and I say to that, Yes.  I feel that he accomplished what most would have failed.  He has proven, at least to me, that Diagon Alley truly exists - if only I could find the right brick to tap on.  The world of Harry Potter is no longer fantasy to me, but instead a place where any of us mere Muggles could hope to visit, one day.One of my favorite moments, is what I'm going to refer to as the Adrenaline Sequence.  By Adrenaline Sequence, I mean the sequence in a movie that for all intents and purposes, doesn't necessarily propel the story, but gives the audience a huge theatrical payoff, ala the Pod Race sequence in The Phantom Menace.  The Adrenaline Sequence for this particular movie is the Quidditch sequence.  I was very happy to finally see the 'hockey/soccer hybrid on a broomstick' come to life.  The Quidditch Sequence is, by far, my favorite sequence in the whole film.  The scene is dizzying in it's violence and it's one breathless moment after another.  My hat goes off to Columbus and his team for succeeding in making this scene as memorable as it should be.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a fantastic movie for children of all ages.

What a Brilliantly Fun Way to Begin a Monumental Franchise,"If for nothing else, the Harry Potter films always find a way to give me a great sense of nostalgia. I, like many others, grew up with this franchise. In many ways, this was our generation's Star Wars. It was the 2000's pop culture phenomena. I'm happy to say that the first film, The Sorcerer's Stone, still undoubtedly holds up.I feel like I should first mention just how impressive it is that Warner Bros and their casting directors found the perfect Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Yes, the rest of the film is also impeccably casted with Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, Robbie Coltrane, and Tom Felton just to mention a few, but it's the core three characters that carry this franchise. Watching the three of them play off each other so effectively at such a young age is truly awe-inspiring.Granted, heroes are only as good as their villains, and luckily they have a great one in Lord Voldemort. Even though in Sorcerer's Stone it's hard to really call him in the big-bad, considering he's not resurrected yet, but his presence is definitely felt. With that said, I wish they would have involved Professor Quirrell more in the main plot. He's a sketchy guy, but you never get a real sense that he's working to resurrect Voldemort. In fact, he's barely in the movie, so his presence towards the end is unexpected, but I didn't feel like it was earned.But the mishandling of the villain doesn't diminish the tremendous amount of fun The Sorcerer's Stone brings to the young franchise. Chris Columbus does a nice job of setting up all the relationships and characters we will come to love later like Hagrid, Dumbledore, and even Snape. This is clearly focused on the trio, but they each get a chance to chew up some scenery with the young wizards. Everything from a clumsy giant, the dark forest, a game of quidditch, to an important game of chess make The Sorcerer's Stone one of the most memorable entries into the Potter franchise.+The trio are effortlessly cute and entertaining+Pacing+All the beloved characters sprinkled in+Balances a bunch of genres in one-Villain reveal is iffy8.4/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"An enjoyable movie, but nothing great.","This movie was my first introduction to Harry Potter. Seeing it in the theater with a few of my cousins, I didn't know what to expect. What I got was a fairly enjoyable, though overlong, movie that kept me interested until the end.

Still, I would not consider it a great film. The special effects are impressive (especially the quiddich match), and the adult actors do a good job (especially Alan Rickman as Professor Snape), but in some ways it feels like a commercial, advertising for Harry Potter video games, toys, and the books.Good for a rental, but I wouldn't buy it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Entertaining,"Not a perfect story, but a lovely introduction into these characters and J. K. Rowling's magical world of wizards.

The casting is excellent, including the principal three (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint) and the teachers at Hogwarts (Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, and Richard Harris). The film was a little too long and had scenes that seemed a little disconnected, leading to a rather brief, anticlimactic ending, but overall there's a reason the franchise was so popular, and this got it off the ground in good form.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
first year of our magical adventure,While I look back on this first entry into the Harry Potter series fondly it is not with out a few problems with adaption from the books. Our trio of main actors are very young and as a result we get plently of chessey acting. Looking back however it is great too see the beginning roots of the characters that we get very attached too through out the series. We get too see them grow as actors. A great cast was put together that stayed more or less the same through out the whole franchise. The effects in the movie are handled well for its time despite Harry not actually using any magic.

A Truly Magical Start,"It's hard to imagine just how influential the Harry Potter series has been on my life. It was released around the time I was born, and I can't really ever remember a time when it wasn't my favorite world to escape into. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is the first book I can remember becoming a fan of, and wanting to read it again straight away. I'm not even going to pretend that I can judge this without bringing over my fondness for the books.For all the fault this first movie has, it feels like a soon-to-be classic, with many aspects featured here becoming ubiquitous in popular culture. The score by John Williams is recognized worldwide as a magical and wondrous piece of music, conjuring up images of broomsticks, wands, and giant castles hidden in the mountains. Hogwarts Castle itself is now an enormously successful theme park in Florida, Osaka, and more on the way. King's Cross has become a tourist attraction, with hundreds of fans waiting in line to take a picture with the trolley at Platform 9 3/4 every day.The cast from the very beginning is stock full of British acting royalty, great actors sinking their teeth and relishing every bit of dialogue. The young actors do their best and it's fun to see them start off, knowing what lies ahead for them, both in the course of the series and afterwards as well.The opening sequences have a real sense of mystery and wonder, possibly enhanced by the knowledge of the truth about Harry's real identity. The introductions to characters and places are perfect, most notably: Diagon Alley, Alan Rickman as Snape, and our first glimpse of Hogwarts.The story is simple and mostly an excuse for world-building, but what a world to get lost in. In my head, Hogwarts wasn't so...practical, but it looks like a place a child of 11 would consider the most amazing place in the world. The creatures and rules and spells add to the fun.The film does feature shoddy CGI (the quidditch match is particularly bad) and at 2 and a half hours it is overlong. It's hard to ignore, though, the place in popular culture it has attained and the earnest sense of wonder and fun that it offers to everyone who gives it a chance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
*The Key to a Hidden World : A Magical Odyssey*,"""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is not merely a film; it is a beautifully crafted portal to a realm where magic is both fantastical and deeply relatable. Directed by Chris Columbus, this cinematic adaptation of J. K. Rowling's beloved novel serves as the enchanting introduction to a universe teeming with wonders, challenges, and heartwarming friendships.From the moment the audience is introduced to a young Harry, portrayed with sincerity by Daniel Radcliffe, we embark on a journey from the mundane to the marvelous. With his signature round glasses and untameable hair, Harry is the quintessential underdog-a boy who unknowingly carries the promise of an extraordinary legacy. His transition from the neglected existence in the Dursleys' home to the hallowed halls of Hogwarts is a masterclass in storytelling, beautifully encapsulating themes of belonging and self-discovery.The film is a spectacle, rich with immersive details that bring J. K. Rowling's enchanting world to life. The breathtaking depictions of Hogwarts, with its moving staircases and magical creatures, transport viewers to a place where imagination reigns supreme. Each room, each shadowy corner of the castle, feels alive-a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of the set designers, makeup artists, and visual effects teams. The magic of Quidditch is thrillingly captured, both exhilarating and hilarious, showcasing the whimsical yet competitive spirit that pervades the wizarding world.The film excels in its ensemble cast, from the steadfastly loyal Ron Weasley, played with excellent comedic timing by Rupert Grint, to the effortlessly intelligent Hermione Granger, embodied by Emma Watson with a blend of confidence and vulnerability. Their friendship with Harry is portrayed with authenticity; it is both playful and profound, emphasizing the power of companionship in overcoming adversity. The trio reminds us of our own childhood friendships, filled with shared dreams, fears, and adventures.Supporting characters, such as the warm-hearted Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), the enigmatic Dumbledore (Richard Harris), and Malfoy's smarmy arrogance (Tom Felton), enrich the narrative, creating a tapestry of personalities that resonate with viewers of all ages. Each character, no matter how small, contributes to the overarching narrative of courage, friendship, and the battle between good and evil.John Williams' iconic score envelops the film in a cocoon of nostalgia and wonder, with unforgettable themes that pierce the heart during moments of triumph and reflect the gravitas of despair. His music is the heartbeat of the film, guiding us through its emotional highs and lows, making the magic feel all the more tangible.""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" captures the essence of childhood-where every corner promises adventure, and the impossible becomes possible. It invites us to believe in the extraordinary while rooting us in the importance of love, bravery, and friendship. In a world that often feels disconnected, the film serves as a gentle reminder to embrace our inner child, to find joy in the journey, and to believe in the magic that exists within us all. This film isn't merely an introduction to wizardry; it's an invitation to rediscover wonder.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
One of my favorites,"Okay I'm gonna say this honestly, I absolutely love this movie. Take in mind that I've read the novels, I'm a big fan and I watched this movie for the first time when I was 10. This is a good adaptation of a great book, but I will say that the only thing that disappoints me now when I watch it is that I can't help, but imagine what it would have been like if JK's first choice of director had been picked (Terry Gilliam). Terry would have definitely been more creative and he probably would have brought something different to the table. I agree with British film critic Mark Kermode, Columbus does have a rather ""bland and straight-forward"" direction style. Now that may work in some movies, but not in a fantasy film like Harry Potter. I must say though in his defense that second movie was much better than the first one, and it seemed to be an improvement for Chris who was probably a lot more comfortable with his surroundings, and had a better relationship with the actors. Still both films are a bit bland in comparison to the rest of the franchise, most of all if we were to compare the first two, to the third one which was directed by the wonderful Alfonso Cuarón, who's style of direction is considerably different from Columbus'. Apart from the blandness the film is great fun for the whole family, and there's always a distinctive energy when you're watching a new HP flick in theaters with a bunch of enthusiastic fans. People are saying now that Twilight is going to replace HP, but I don't think so. The Twilight fan base is only a third of the HP fan base, and the film series is close to been the biggest franchise of all time, and I think they can actually accomplish that. There's great acting by everyone, most of all by the Golden Trio, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and the lovely Emma Watson. Also stand out performances by Maggie Smith as the strict but fair Professor McGonagall, and Alan Rickman as the ""greasy git"", also known as Professor Snape. Richard Harris excels as the Headmaster of Hogwarts Academy, Dumbledore. He plays Harry's mentor to a tee. And I have to say I sorely miss him even if Gambon is doing a great job as his replacement. I just wish Richard would have lived far enough to finish the film series, but I guess you can't get everything you wish for.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
How wonderful a movie it is!,"How wonderful a movie it is!The author of the book is J.K.Rowling. She wrote seven books which The Unite States Warner Brothers made into eight movies. Directed by Chris Columbus, produced by Heyday Films the released dates was 2002-2011. The total Running time is 1179 minutes. Great for all types of audiences.Daniel Jacob Radcliffe, Rupert Alexander and Emma Charlotte were cast for the films. The cast also includes Helena Bonham Carter, Kenneth Charles, Miranda Richardson.

It has stood the test of time as one of the greatest fantasy movies of the twenty-first century,"I have recently been revisiting the Harry Potter franchise during the ongoing pandemic and I have been wondering whether these movie that I hadn't seen in a decade would have aged well or not. My conclusion is that most of them have aged particularly well and this is especially the case for the first two movies that I consider the best of the franchise. The producers' idea to hire veteran director Chris Columbus was certainly a decisive one in hindsight since he managed to transform a first novel with numerous lengths into an extremely entertaining film for the entire family.The movie has numerous other strengths that need to be pointed out. Even two decades later, the special effects still look stunning and do the great novel series justice. The visual effects are magical, the sound effects are epic and the lighting techniques increase the movie's multiple shifts in atmosphere.The locations have been chosen with care as well. Harry Potter's home looks as boring, desolate and exchangeable as it's described in the novel. The scene at the lighthouse oozes with atmosphere. King's Cross busy Platform 9 3/4 looks very colourful, detailed and imaginative. The extraordinary train ride to Hogwarts invites to dream yourself far away. The highlight is obviously Hogwarts and its surroundings as nearly every section in this gigantic castle comes around with creative details and imaginative surprises.The film certainly convinces with its detailed storytelling and diversified subplots. It takes all the time it needs to introduce us to numerous most entertaining classes at Hogwarts. The sections that show and explain Harry Potter's Quidditch career are so detailed that even someone who hasn't read the novel will understand how this fascinating wizarding sport works. The film carefully and credibly develops the friendship between lead characters Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Everything is however wrapped up perfectly in an adventurous, entertaining and epic finale where the three protagonists have to face numerous challenges related to the main plot as an impostor is aiming to steal the mysterious Sorcerer's Stone for a most sinister purpose.The young actresses and actors are doing excellent jobs and are truly convincing in their roles. Daniel Radcliffe shines as confused and isolated but soon enough adventurous and imaginative young wizard going through dynamic changes. Rupert Grint excels as friendly but clumsy young wizard who you are going to appreciate right from the start. Emma Watson shines as self-confident, intellectual and slightly arrogant young wizard whose academic performances are incredibly inspiring. The adult actors have also been chosen with care. Richard Harris's performance as principal Albus Dumbledore is the best ever for this role as he convinces as wise, patient and kind mentor that you will like right from the start. My personal highlight is Alan Rickman as cold, gloomy and unpredictable professor who seems to be antagonist and protagonist all at once.In the end, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is not only the only movie that I prefer over its novel version in the franchise but also one of the two best movies in the inspiring fantasy film franchise that has left a significant mark on an entire generation of children and teenagers two decades ago. The film has aged quite well and should still impress children and teenagers as well as their parents all around the world nowadays. The movie has been executed with care in every single department and has lost nothing of its unique charm. It would go as far to state that it stands as one of the very best fantasy movies of the twenty-first century.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Wizard film,"In many ways the best of the franchise so far. I was free from any anticipation for this film being not overly impressed by the fantasy genre. This film redeems itself above other sorcery films with its old fashioned English ambiance being greater than arch and portentous fantasy.Unlike other fantasy films the directors face the challenge of a highly critical audience of children who are more familiar with the books that they are & waiting expectantly for their favorite part of the book and would tear the director to ices if he was there in their anger such omissions. Any changes in the film would be seen as desecrating the fantasy world that Rowling created. In the production of the first film this was a contention in preproduction. As a faithful rendering of the book squeezed into a two-and-a-half hour period, the movie is beautifully done as far as special effects go. The actors although experienced are let down by the younger cast not being trained and coming from a stage school background with the exception of the lead show the typical stiltedness of such training. Daniel Radcliffe has been accused of being too subdued in the title role but as he becomes older he character does become more sombre. Alos it allows the other characters oddities to shine more clearly in contrast to his quieter style.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry Potter is a bore!,"I know I'm probably the only one that didn't care for this film, but I thought it was plain boring. The adaptation of the book is just OK and the acting is average. Frankly it's a pity to see all the great English actors in this film totally wasted and relegated to play second fiddle. The effects are very well done, but it's such a conventional treatment of the books that I kept checking my watch a few times to see when was it going to be over. It's very curious that hardly any of the young people in the audience didn't laugh at all. This Harry Potter is very heavy handed and it should have emphasized the fun and could have used a few lighter moments.I was greatly disappointed given the hype in the media, which I'm sure has Ms. Rowling, Mr. Columbus and the rest of the people responsible for this mess laughing all the way to the bank!",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Good Start to the Series,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001)*** (out of 4)Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is taken away from his obnoxious and abusive aunt and uncle and taken to the Hogwarts Academy where he's going to learn to become a wizard. He becomes friends with Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). It doesn't take long for Potter to learn about his past as well as what's expected of him in the future.I'm going to be really honest and admit that I've never read a single line of any of the novels and in all honesty I never really paid too much attention to what they were even about. I'm watching this first film on March 15, 2016 so that's nearly fifteen years since this was released so obviously you can't say I'm a fan of anything involving the characters. I really wasn't sure what to expect going into the movie but by the time the end credits started there's no doubt that I was left entertained.I thought for the most part this was a pretty entertaining film and I think everyone got it right in regards to the casting. I mean the three leads are all extremely good for their roles and I thought all of them managed to help carry the film. Radcliffe was certainly believable in the role of this master wizard and I thought both Grint and Watson added a lot of charm. Then you've got the likes of John Cleese, Alan Rickman, John Hurt, Maggie Smith and Richard Harris.I'm not normally a fan of CGI heavy movies but I thought it was perfectly used here and never really took away from the story. Instead of taking away from the story it actually did a very good job at adding to this alternative universe and the various magic that is to be found in it. Technically speaking the film was certainly well made with a ripping score, great effects as well as fine editing and cinematography. If I had to say anything negative about the picture it would be the incredibly long running time.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

The world of Hogwarts is amazing and makes you want to wish it was a real place.

Magical fun.,"Based on the book Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, this is the first film in the Harry Potter film trilogy, a story about a young boy (Harry Potter) who is rescued from the clutches of a neglectful aunt and uncle and a bratty cousin, and taken to study witchcraft at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. There he meets his future lifelong friends Ron Weasley and Hermoine Granger, witches Professor Snape and Professor McGonagall and the school's all-powerful headmaster, Albus Dumbledore. Harry also learns about his connection with the evil dark lord, Lord Voldemort.I think this movie followed the J.K. Rowling's novel very well, including in it most details that capture the imagination, magic, adventure and drama of the story. Director Christopher Columbus and the team of writers and special effects people gave a pretty entertaining and believable movie. And, the acting was spot-on, most notably the brilliance of Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane and Richard Harris. The rivalry between the school houses Gryffindor and Slytherin were tastefully depicted; I just wished the other two houses, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were emphasized a little more. I didn't care too much for the Quidditch match, as I thought it was a long-drawn out ballgame.Overall, it's a good introduction for the film series and I think is one of the best in the series as well.Grade B+",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Interesting movie to watch,"The main story is about a famous boy that named harry potter and the reason of his famous is because of he was the only child that he alived from the Voldemort. So he had a really good character smart enough, brave and he was a honestly person to his friends because at the end of movie he shows himself dreams or lies can't track him and he was ready to sacrifice for his friends furthermore we can say he was much powerful to have fight with Voldemort. The girl played and important part to she had a really strange character because she's really careful person about everything the smartest one and with high knowledge about different kinds of magices. The friend of harry potter is the trueness one because of his veracity he was ready to sacrifice himself for his friends and it shows he had the most honest character between harry potter and the girl . These three friends together could stop Voldemort if non of each weren't going to have friendship to each other Voldemort will comeback again and just couldn't face with him because he just need a stone to get his power again, but harry patter wich is strong enough for Voldemort. He should face his dreams and don't fall for the lies of Voldemort and don't turn to darkside of magic and with Voldemort. It describes harry potter is strong enough. To sum up movie shows that the three main characters with their character reviews are just complete wich each other and they're being complementary together harry potter : the strongest the girl : smartest the boy: Sincerely . The director wanted to mention that loyalty can play a really important part in friendship no matter girl or boy also we should be honest to our friends to make the relationship better and better also the trust is the other side of it that makes relationship complete 100 percent when a both side of friendships have honest the can trust each other and solve problems that we saw in this movie so the director wants to prove it to us.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"A Good Film, but not the Book","Harry Potter, arguably one of the most famous book series, didn't take long for to be adapted for the screen. Facing big expectations the first movie did well to hold its own.Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is a neglected boy who lives with his mean aunt, uncle, and cousin.

Chris Columbus (The Goonies) directs and does a fine job of bringing the magical world to life.It is definitely worth seeing but be sure not to neglect the books.

"An Absolute Delight for Children of all Ages,","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline and a talented cast. It's a delight to watch, I've seen this movie numerous times and it never fails to make me smile, to cheer me up when I'm feeling down, the Harry Potter franchise is magical both inside and out, and it's simple fun to watch Harry go in to his first year at Hogwarts, the story's quite simple as the series kicks off with a light start, but it will still leave you wanting more. The films biggest flaw is, at times, it is too faithful to the book that it is based off, I'm sure this is pleasing for anyone who's read the book, but for those who haven't it tends to drag out at times, more than an hour passes before Potter even goes to Hogwarts and the main adventure dosen't unfold properly until at least one hundred minutes in, it can get a little tedious at times and that's why I'm giving it an eight instead of a nine that it easily could have received. The cast is outstanding, the young cast members are ridiculously talented for their age, Daniel Radcliffe seems to have no trouble playing a lead role, and both Rupert Grint and Emma Watson shine as his closest friends, they never lose a single bit of likability. They are joined by a terrific adult cast, including the likes of Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane and, the highlight of the movie for me, Richard Harris, he shines as Professor Dumbledore (sadly only for two movies), his characterization is perfect, he is wise, heartwarming and simply a lovable character. It may be a bit slow at times, but Harry Potter and the Philiosopher's Stone never loses its sense of fun and magic, and because of this it is a perfect film for the whole family to watch and enjoy.A young boy learns the truth about his special powers, that he is a wizard and must prove his worth at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.Best Performance: Richard Harris Worst Performance: James Phelps",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

"I understand the nostalgic effect for people, and it's not a bad movie, either, but a bit overrated","Before starting my review, I must preface a few things. I haven't read the novel(or the novels), and I haven't thoroughly watched the sequels. Another thing is I know that the writer of the novel(s) is a bit of a right winger bigot, but I haven't taken that into account when reviewing the movie.The movie is definitely a memorable one, mostly due to how good it is visually, rather than having a strong story. Having said that, the CGI in the movie, sadly, doesn't hold up, despite the fact that it came out in the same year as The Lord of The Rings, CGI of which still looks convincing, if not amazing. However, as I said, other than the CGI, the movie looks really good; all the set designs, characters, etc. Just like the novels, this is a film for children, and I have no problem with adults enjoying it, however, I can't think of myself watching this again in the future. There were a few things in the film that bothered me, especially because it's a children's movie, like when they were playing chess towards the end, to pass a gate or something, why did Ron have to ''sacrifice'' himself? He commanded the other pieces verbally, why did he have to ride the knight? Who made the rules? I don't like exposing children to dumb stuff like that. And there were other inexplicable, illogical things like these.It's not an important, a milestone film in cinema, and I am only saying it's overrated, because how popular it is, but it is not too bad of a movie, and I especially understand its nostalgic value for the people who watched this as a kid.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A Very Nice Effort,"Okay, I never read the Harry Potter Books. I couldn't have cared less, but I have nieces and nephews and other children in my life who are from ages 7 to 12 who have. What I had to do was remember what it was like when I was that age, so long ago, and what ""new"" movies I had to entertain myself with.So...I had ""Oliver!"", ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" and ""Chitty, Chitty, Bang! Bang!"". Other than those, it was ""R"" rated films that I was more interested in.  Why? For that is what interested me via what Hollywood made available. I was ""too old"" for those cutie Disney Animated cartoons of that time, and too young for the adult theme films that were being advertised which I DID want to see. This is why I like this film, it brings back the genre for children, the wonder, the fantasy in film just for them.A nice effort production wise, with the casting, with the story. Children love fantasy, wonder, adventure, a character THEIR age doing and thinking like THEY would and...watching kids eat lots of ""sweets"". This Harry Potter film fit the bill.For me as an adult, it was...nice. For children between 7 and 12, its fantastic. The special effects were neat, the story was engaging for them, but what I liked the best was the school itself. I thought that the classes and interactions of the children with each other were on their level. So it was at a Wizards school. Point is, it could be at ANY school. (or boarding school!)In my surroundings, there have been a few adults/parents screaming about how this film and the school ""Hogwarts"" promotes kids to get into the black arts. I think that is so awful to think that, and I think it does not give children the benefit of the doubt. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is a nice little film about something a child/pre-teen has fun with. I actually compared it to the Disney film ""Fantasia"" and the scene of Mickey being the ""Sorcerer's Apprentice"". I watched that over and over as a 6 year old and trust me, I had no desire to get into ""the black arts"".To me, this film is geared towards that audience that has been forgotten AND portrayed in the last 15 years, the 7 to 12 year olds. Yes, Disney had alot of animation that was marketed to that group of children, but its been quite sometime to make a long full length feature film of fantasy where children are the focus, and they are just...children. Reminds me of ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" and ""Chitty, Chitty, Bang, Bang""...fantasy films for the 7 to 12 year old to enjoy the movie going experience on their level, but NOT talking DOWN to them.Children under 7 may be a bit scared at some parts and teens over 13 may not get into this film at all. But for the 7 to 12 year olds, this film is a nice one for them in the same vein as ""Oliver!"" and ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" was for me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

The Philosopher's Stone is pure magic.,"I've decided to revisit the Harry Potter film series, starting with Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.

Every actor brings their character to life so vividly that they feel like old friends-memorable, lovable, and irreplaceable.

Good but too long and with few strong characters,"Dropped with his aunt and uncle as a baby, Harry grows up in a loveless home and is made to sleep under the stairs.  On his 11th birthday Harry learns the truth of his past when he is visited by Rubeus Hagrid and invited to attend Hogwart's school for wizards and witches.  Whilst learning his craft Harry and his friends notice some strange things and begin to investigate, leading them deeper into a mystery that involves a dark wizard who killed Harry's parents and a quest for a powerful stone that brings immortality.I had no strong desires to see this film.  I have not read any of the books, nor do I have any plans to as they just don't interest me.  Back in my family home one week I noticed they had bought a copy of this film on VHS and I decided to give it a watch.  I knew little of the plot but it carried me along well enough.  It did seem a little long and that the film was trying to cram as many effects scenes as possible where it should really have been developing characters instead.  Don't get me wrong the effects are all good and hold the interest well, but without the characters I felt like I didn't care very much about the plot.I know this is a children's film so characters aren't that important but that leads me to another point  the running time.  At over two hours I struggled to care enough to sustain my interest.  I don't have kids but I did wonder how many would be able to focus for that long  but I suppose that the reason for throwing in an effects scene every five minutes just to wake them up!The cast is crammed with talent  most of which it fails to make good use of.  In the lead Radcliffe is quite bland and didn't do too much with his role.  Happily Grint and Watson who both are funny and have good characters  even if they are only sidekicks in the film, supported him.  It is telling that recent publicity for the second film has put these two on a par with Harry  even giving them their own posters.  Of the support cast only Coltrane is well used, everyone else just has cameos of one sort or another. Hart, Cleese, Harris, Rickman, Smith etc all have only a few scenes at most and (in the case of Rickman and Cleese) a few lines at most.  This is annoying on two levels.  Firstly, the fact that such talent is wasted and secondly the fact that none of them are allowed characters  only a chance to show their face briefly once or twice.Overall it was enjoyable and will please kids even if only for the regular effects scenes.  It has flaws and it is clearly aimed at those who have Potter fever already.  N the strength of this I will not be going to see the second film until someone gives it to me to watch.  It's a good film but it feels like it is made to see Happy Meals and start a franchise than to be a good film in it's own right. (as a side note  I find it hilarious that it had to be renamed for the USA as the studio felt that the word `philosopher' would confuse American audiences who didn't know what it meant!)",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
satisfied movie,"The Harry Potter series has always been my favorite magic movie. I am a fan of Emma Watson, and I watch every movie of hers. I love Hermione so much.

"Author J.K. Rowling was born on July 31st, 1965","All the Harry Potter films in this series are pretty good. Some are better than others, but over-all, the seven together is quite a motion picture experience. This one is the first one in the series and is the best one to get started with. This first film is so well produced, that it should satisfy you enough to watch even more of them. This film also works on its own. That is good, in case, you never get a chance to see another one again in your life. Start with the first one I always say. Being the first film also means, I have seen it the most. I saw this film as soon as it landed on DVD, then when I realized there would be a seven or eight film run on the Harry Potter series, i stopped watching them and waited for all of them to be released in a DVD package, which I finally finished in 2017. This film still works great today as it did 20 years ago.8.7 (B+ MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A Warm and Whimsical Delight,"Harry Potter is a beloved franchise, and the films capture the magic and the brilliance very well, some do and some don't. I won't mention about the books when I review and rate the Harry Potter films, not because I don't want to or can't be bothered to but purely on the fact I've only read the Trilogy of Books 1-3. So when reviewing these sort of things you have to be consistent with your complaints and why something is bad or poorly adapted. And I can only do that for the first three films so it wouldn't really make much sense. Regardless of this I hope you take this as a good thing and for the unfortunate ones that get to read this review enjoy. And it's only come across my mind to revisit this franchise now as there up on Netflix. With all that boring stuff out of the way let's get into this.First off, when we're talking about original stories and how they became who they are now, Ie meaning the first film is vital. And I think it does a pretty good job of that. The Characters are well established. We get to understand Harry and sympathise with him. Which is a great start for an origin story to do these kind of things. We Know streight away that Harry's Mum and Dad have passed. I like this as an entry as we get to see abit of past history, and that's what makes Number 2 and 3 so good at establishing time. So It sets the standards of what is to come. And also the fact that he lives with his aunt and uncle, along side his cousin too. And we find out just from the first 10 minutes alone that they are abusive and make him do things that he probably doesn't want to do, let's face it. This is great because it makes his character more relatable in the sense that he is stuck in a small room and a house with horrible guadians. And as I've said previously it means we can roote for this character. As he's not paper-thin, he's already had great growth in only 10 minutes which is fantastic. As his character is layered. Dudley is precived as an arrogant person who wants anything and everything. This is great contrast from how Harry is portrayed to be. And although it may seem to be a bit of a stereotype Dudleys great character development takes it away from that. Moving on from the great character development, is now time for Hagrid to shine, or stand tall if y'k what I mean.Hagrid,Who is the person that invites Harry to Hogwarts in the first place. Robbie Coltrane who is a show stealer, having some fantastic scenes he carries and elevates the parts that he's in. So first of all I like the fact that we get to see Dursleys reaction to this news that he gets accepted at Hogwarts and wizardry, as he is a wizard. Although maybe he can't be! I feel like my only nitpick of this scene is how Daniel Radcliffe says it. As he isn't like surprised or anything. But then he is 11 so I don't want to sound to harsh but it is a bit of ashame. Anyhow, when he agrees to go with Hagrid. We get to see the scenes at the Wond shop, the bar too. Which are all really great scenes. And it is partly because these scenes make us question why Harry is so well Known by all these strangers. And another reason as to why it's good is the musical score which is tremendous. It really feels like your in a magical world. When they sit down for Lunch, Harry is showing signs of confusion understandably, about why he's so well known. Hagrid stutters and lies to him, this is a great scene as it makes the audience wait for what is to come next, creating Shock value. But Hagrid eventually tells us the story, the story about a dark Wizard. This is some more great storytelling. As it goes back to the past elements showcasing there just as important as them being here and now, kind of scenarios. Harry then after Lunch is left with a ticket to send him to Hogwarts, which leads me to my next point.The Sets/Costume designsTo put it bluntly these set designs are truly amazing and are well integrated with in the story. As the story lingers on certain scenes, which is great to see as we know from the Restaurant to the shops for Wizards to the train that these are all important parts of the story for Harry and other characters growth. For example they do many things and learn many wizarding lessons at Hogwarts. Which has a really great design. The Woods where Harry who's made some Friends. One named Hermione and the other named Ron. Who all have detention with there arc Nemesis Malfoy. Harry and Malfoy go into these woods together. With the others splitting up and going into 2 groups. I like the colour and lighting the woods have. The dark colouring is truly great because it creates these impactful moments and not just that but also suspense. As unfortunately for Harry and Malfoy they see a dark figure. Who's you know who. Luckily some guy with a horse and head, some kind of mythical creature I don't remember the name, but yeah anyway he saves them. Harry to be more precise. As Malfoy runs off screaming like a little girl.Story/ActingSome scenes are elevated if the Acting is good. And the cast members do a fantastic job of this on the whole. There's a mystery to this story like who's guading the dogs and why are the dogs there. These raise good questions. But Ron, Harry and Hermione all being victims of there own doing by being wreckless troublemakers decide to stoop around in business that's not there's. And tell Hagrid how they think Snape is guarding something. And rightfully so as he's quite mysterious. Hagrid defends Snape brilliantly perfomed by Allen Rickman by the way, and tells the kids to stop meddling! Just like Scooby-Doo gang. However as the reckless teenagers they are they try and find out who it is. And in order of this they have to play there way out of the things that stand in there way, like the long Chess game. That's in some other Harry potter films too. This scene gets to see the kids play and fight for there lives. Harry the one that goes and finds out who is behind all this malarkey and mayhem, is not Professor Snape but Professor Squirel. This shocks the audience members, and to find out that he's Voldemort is even more of a shock.The Music throughout the film was also great too. Way ahead of its time.My Nitpicks,This is a minor nitpick but it's the acting from Daniel Radcliffe who in some scenes shows no real emotion to becoming a wizard. And in other scenes he's not bad but not great. The 11yr old still showed promise though however.The other nitpick I have is the fact that they bought in a Troll who somehow came in Unnoticed? Yeah that was strange. And how it added nothing to the plot. However despite these nitpicks it's still a great film.Does need more magic in it though in my opinion.Ending the review on a high though I love the Mirror scene where Harry is sitting in a room and seeing his Mum and dad. This scene brought tears to my eyes. Now time for the Verdict.Verdict,7/10 A wonderful start that if wasn't good there wouldn't be 7 other movies of it, truly grate.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

There, in his first year with his friends Ron and Hermione, he must stop wrongdoing of a couple teachers. The cast was wonderfully casted. Daniel Radcliffe is fantastic and looks the part of Harry. Everyone else is perfect. As I mentioned above, the adaptation is great. The movie even used the same quotations as the books. The music is memorable. I liked John William's Hedwig Theme.

Overrated but entertaining,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, based on the novel it seems every kid has read (to my surprise considering that I hated reading most books as a kid, especially ones that looked longer than 200 pages and had little or no pictures but then I'm not a kid anymore) is now a movie and while it is certainly overrated and sometimes stupid, it gives some decent moments of entertainment.  It is another film that will depend on the viewer on how much he/she can take with near non-stop adventure and (impressive) visual effects.  It's a wonder the film made 93 million in one weekend (isn't that a sign of biblical armageddon though), but since the film is directed a lot more at kids it's not a total surprise since the movie gets a big reccomendation in the family film department.  But teens and adults might not want to walk in the theater prepared to see the greatest film since Wizard of Oz like the kids are.A little long but never really boring, Harrpy Potter offers up a nice stew of excitement on this thanksgiving weekend with some great visuals and score (from John Williams).

Part 1,"If you don't know your Potter (like me), than you might have a problem with the titles. With other series, it's easier to distinguish, which one is part 1, 2, 3 etc. etc. Even the Naked Gun series which has Parts 2 and half and 33 and a third, you still know the order (not of the Phoenix obviously!) ;o)But enough about my (let's call it) ignorance, for the books (haven't read them guilty as charged) and off to the movie itself. Which is obviously targeted at a young audience. And it delivers on this premise. Plus it has to introduce characters to the world (for those who know them and those who don't). A good job overall, but nothing great in my eyes ...",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Ahh, the magic begins.","Harry Potter is an Orphan who on his eleventh birthday discovers he's a wizard and is called to term at Hogwarts School. But Harry is soon to find out that his past, and his destiny, is a truly remarkable, magical, and terrifying thing.Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone arrived in a blaze of publicity, one of the most hyped and talked about motion pictures of the decade had finally arrived. The box office was guaranteed to bulge based on fandom book base alone, regardless of if the film got bad word of mouth or not, it was destined to be a monster smash hit. To someone like me who to this day has never read any of the Harry Potter books, it was easy for me to view objectively without comparison to the source - I enjoyed it immensely upon theatre release, and I still enjoy it equally as much now.Director Christopher Columbus, I believe has wisely stayed loyal to the source material, and thus pleased the literature masses. Yet not all newcomers to the party were that taken by the magic on show, that's a little baffling to me because the budget explodes from the screen at every turn. Oliver Twist like sets form the marvellous Diagon Alley, dream like smoke cloaks the splendid Hogwarts Express, the school itself is a monolithic delight nestling in among eerie mountains - and what about the exhilarating introduction of Quidditch? Pulsating and frantic with no amount of devilment to keep us intrigued throughout.The characters are all perfectly formed in the first two thirds of the film, here Columbus pulls off a masterstroke by interjecting the character arcs with dashes of wonder so that we the audience never gets bored. The final reel plays out solidly as per the mysterious ""who done it"" core of the piece, but it's down to the previous work in the film that we actually care come the finale. Some great casting of the adults really helps to make the film triumph, with Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane (one of the best casting jobs of the decade I would say), Richard Harris, Alan Rickman and Zoe Wanamaker all doing excellent work here. The kids are all newcomers that overnight were to become household names, all fresh faced and wet behind the ears, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint & Tom Felton are a delight to watch, and they all help to keep the feeling of charm constantly glowing up on the screen.Owls here, witches there, what's that strange three headed dog doing over there? The Harry Potter franchise begins with a bang and a whip of the wand, and I and gazillions of others personally love it. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
It's 'Philosopher's Stone'!,"I'm not really a big fan of the HP films. I don't think that they translate well from the books as they are often quite long and need severe cutting down in order to fit into a 2 hour+ film. This has been increasingly evident in the later HP sequels, but Philosopher's Stone seems to be pretty much all intact.I do find Chris Columbus' mostly naturalized approach to shooting the film to be the most appropriate. In GOF, Mike Newell had the cheap and uncheerful logic of shooting everything with a heavy green filter to make it look 'mysterious' and 'magical'. I think it just looks stupid and that the far-fetched fantasy nature is more identifiable if shot more ordinarily.What does bug me about this film and always surprises me on repeat viewings, is how horrible the entire kiddie cast are at acting. Check out the terrible performance from the guy who plays the blandly named Oliver Wood! Woof! It's like watching some rubbish Primary School play with big budget visual effects. It takes me out of the movie every time.The 150-minute running time seems to pass by in a breeze, something I've never really felt with the sequels. But something that bugs me is even right here at the beginning Dumbledore seems to be like 'I'll tell you about it when you're older, Harry.' Which is a cheap hook to make us read/watch the later installments.I don't really have that much to say about Philosopher's Stone, which is why my review is short and spiceless. It's a shame the sequels had to be so boring. Stick with the books, a couple are overwritten but they are superior to the films. A clichéd thing to say, but still true.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"I you haven't a trace of magic in you, you'll love this...","It's a movie made for people who think that magic is cute and fun.  If you're a fantasy fan like I am, and believe in magic (in a fictional sense) then you may very well detest this movie, as I did.  Magic comes easily to little Harry Potter, who has no personality to speak of except that he is occasionally sad that he never met his mum and dad.  Years of abuse and neglect have left not a mark on him, so when he gets invited to Hogwarts Academy of Magic, he has nowhere for his character to go.  There he flies around on his broomstick and gets to be a big hero quite by accident without ever confronting any serious obstacles or anything resembling a plot.  In all this, the film is an excellent adaptation of the book, which also thought that magic is cutesy wootesy.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Stands the Test of Time,"So many movies that you watch when you are younger that you return to later and realize that they just weren't what you remember them to be. In other words, classic cases of nostalgia bias. However, I've now watched the original Harry Potter movie over many times now and it still has not lost its magic. From what I remember it even follows the book quite closely. The casting is absolutely impeccable and it's wonderful that they were able to keep them on for so long. Of course the young actors aren't perfect in their first major roles but in some ways that adds a bit of an innocence to the movie. The effects of course are not at today's standards but still for the time were excellent. Chris Columbus was a great director to bring the magic of Rowling's work to the big screen, especially for the lighter first Harry Potter stories.Out of all the movies I find this one to be the most quotable to this day. It will be quite a challenge to create remakes to this standard. I'm not sure it is even possible, but hope they prove me wrong.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Introducing new generations to the wonders of the wizarding world,"The first installment of the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (titled Sorcerer's Stone in the U.

The film's production quality is exceptional, with meticulous set designs and special effects that vividly bring J. K. Rowling's universe to life. Chris Columbus's direction ensures a faithful adaptation, capturing the essence of the source material.While certain elements from the book are omitted, such as the character Peeves the Poltergeist and the detailed backstory of the Dursleys, the film successfully conveys the core narrative and magical ambiance. The cast delivers commendable performances, with Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson embodying their roles seamlessly. Special mention goes to the actors portraying the Dursley family: Richard Griffiths as Uncle Vernon, Fiona Shaw as Aunt Petunia, and Harry Melling as Dudley. Their portrayal adds depth to the film's opening act, effectively setting the stage for Harry's journey.Overall, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone sets a solid foundation for the series, captivating both longtime fans and new viewers.

"Lacks emotional warmth of ""ET""...a John Williams letdown...","I was drawn into the story the moment the letters started whirling through the air to ""the boy under the cupboard"" and to the amusing trio (Aunt, Uncle, brother) that give interest to the early scenes and make you anxious for Harry to escape life in this demented household. And from the opening scene on, the special effects are nothing short of marvelous despite what some ""critics"" here are calling ""cheesy"" -- I'm sure the film is a strong contender in that category for a Best Special Effects Oscar.Having said that--and not being a fan of Dragons and Dungeons, etc. kind of games--my only disappointment was that most of the ""magic"" was too much on the dark side--without enough humor to keep things in a lighter vein for the most part. If this is what kids like, they'll love being scared time and time again by some of the creatures and situations.I have only praise for the performances, although I agree that Daniel Radcliffe seems to only have two expressions and is indeed bland, but appealing enough, as Harry. Everyone else does their best to bring the characters to life--especially Maggie Smith as head witch and Alan Rickman as Snapes. I think his is the film's outstanding performance.I was aware of too much exposition in the film (to explain to those of us who haven't read the book what Muggles are, etc.) but I'm sure this sort of thing will diminish when the series continues. I was disappointed by the John Williams score, relentless throughout with only one jaunty theme worth remembering.This was made even more obvious by the fact that a trailer for the upcoming re-release of ""ET"" emphasized the difference between his ""ET"" score and the one he wrote for ""Harry Potter"". Obviously, he had much more of an emotional connection to the characters in ""ET"" than was possible for him to have with the characters here. There is no such connection to the characters in this relentlessly busy score.Even Potter's farewell scene before boarding the train for home, lacks the emotional warmth so strongly suggested in ""ET"" -- a factor that makes the entire movie seem a one-dimensional but highly competent version of a beloved book. All of the set pieces are extraordinarily detailed and well executed, including the Chess Game--and there's a nice plot twist toward the end that I won't reveal here. All in all, a good film version of the book which I understand is remarkably faithful to the novel--and don't let anyone tell you the special effects are anything less than superb!Nevertheless, a John Williams letdown. I'm sure Daniel Radcliffe--who is physically perfect for the role--will improve in his bystander reactions. After all, he made a wonderful 'David Copperfield' on PBS not long ago. Despite some drawbacks, looking forward to the next visualization of Potter's adventures.The film is known in England and many other countries abroad as ""...and the Philosopher's Stone"".  Frankly, I think the American title is more suitable as it implies ""witchcraft"" which is the very essence of the story. With the U.K. constantly changing American film titles, it's not surprising at all that we sometimes do the same thing. Apparently, we don't really speak the same language!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Long, but pretty good","Adaptation of J.K. Rowling's very popular book is as good an adaptation as possible...but it doesn't completely work.The big problem was they were afraid to cut anything out of the book (they'd have school children all around the world after them), so they try to put everything in and there's too much for one movie.  Also it's a virtual word-by-word recitation of the book--if you've read the book, you've seen the movie.  This doesn't allow director Chris Columbus any leeway to change things or add his own personal stamp (not that Columbus was ever an inventive director to begin with).  So, it just ends up being the book visualized exactly as written.The acting is so-so.  The kids picked to play Harry, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger are pretty good--not great, but certainly not bad.  The adults vary wildly--Maggie Smith and Zoe Wanamaker (love her yellow eyes!) are just great as teachers at Hogwats...Alan Rickman, Richard Harris and Robbie Coltrane are horrible...they're REALLY not enjoying themselves.

A Good Lark,"Clearly there is a dearth of literature in this country.  I sat down to read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone expecting a prime example of children's literature - what I got was a good story residing in a mediocre book.  It was something akin to the novellas of Robin Cook.  J.K. Rowling seems to have been given the tremendous gift of imagination.  She creates a whole world outside our own to show us how Harry Potter learns to be a wizard, unfortunately, she lacks the grasp of the language required to turn her imaginings into a great work of children's literature.  She is not to be blamed for it as it is a very rare gift, shared by greats such as Roald Dahl and in a different way, Dr. Seuss.It is my honest opinion the movie was substantially better than the book. In most cases, the written word provides enough details to give the reader a clear image of what the author intended, leaving just enough to the imagination to allow the reader to create as scary, loving, ugly, or intense image as s/he chooses, this book did not.  In the case of Harry Potter, Rowling provides too much detail in some places and not enough in others. Had this been written for a creative writing class, the instructor would no doubt have used up copious amounts of ink requesting that Rowling ""show, not tell.""  The imagination of the movie maker must work differently.  Those who create works for film are charged with dazzling the audience with their imaginations.  Columbus succeeds in taking all the details from the book and making them larger than what had been put down in words by the author. Hagrid, the Quidditch match, the portraits on the walls all are crafted by Columbus with a view that seems to reach into the depths of J.K. Rowlings mind and extract all of the glory of what she was imagining, but failed to put down on paper.The cast was remarkable as Alan Rickman and Richard Harris were both perfect for the roles in which they were cast and their performances were marvelous, as always.  The other adult actors and the children all performed at top level as well.In conclusion, I can certainly recommend this movie to virtually anyone. Their is only one word of caution.

Great chemistry set up for the rest of the series,"Harry Potter is an orphan living with his ignorant uncle and aunt under their stairs. He finds out that he is actually a wizard and there is a secret world out there.This is the first of a series, and it introduces the franchise very well. Some of the style is still a little rough. The CGI isn't top notch, and the sets have some work to do. But those are minor drawbacks in an otherwise superb film.The best part of it must be the great chemistry between the three young leads (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint). That is objective number one. With that accomplished, the rest is just icing on the cake. Director Christopher Columbus must be commended for weaving a coherent and compelling story while setting the groundwork for the rest of the franchise.

A return to magical innocence???,"Harry Potter seems to highlight what today's society is missing; the age of magical innocence, the pure abandonment of that essence of childhood. In this day and age of computer games and quick fix takeaway electronic happiness and incessant CGI violence, it's brilliant to see the world excited by story telling and the simple things. It reminds me of years ago as a child reading volumes of Roald Dahl's compositions and hanging out to read the next chapter of 'Danny the Champion of the World'. Harry Potter has engaged the world back into that innocence, even if it is for a two hour movie.The Philosopher's Stone is majestic, bold and outrageously expansive... and I want more. I took my son to a packed cinema and we were both entranced with the.. well.. magic of the package. The awesome Harry Potter theme and musical score, meeting of the main characters, hunting for school items, the train ride, the first look of Hogwarts... It is all magical. The casting of adults are perfect. Richard Harris typifies what a respected all powerful all knowing headmaster should encompass, all the professors are brilliant and Snape could be played by no one else except Alan Rickman.The 'magic' of the surroundings, the little gadgets and seemingly insignificant details are lovely. To be honest, the whole production smacks of that professional quality that is European/British and it was refreshing to be free from the American drawl and plentiful explosions and swearing.Make no mistake, this is a child's movie.

"It's fun, I'll give it that","Having not read the Harry Potter series of books, I'm possibly not the best and most-enlightened person to comment on the film adaptation, but at the same time, I won't be emotionally clouded to adore everything Harry Potter no matter what it's really like, so can provide an objective viewpoint.So, the film is fun. It has its high points and those high points are very enjoyable, but the low points almost completely make up for them. The fact I would assume is that the fun comes from the imagination of J K Rowling in her books rather than the film-makers, and unlike such great children's book adaptations as Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory or even Mary Poppins, the film doesn't seem to add anything enjoyable to the story. It's just fun to see the book come to life on the screen.Personally I'm not much of a fan of the three main actors. Daniel Radcliffe overacts all his pleasant emotions and underacts all his negative emotions while Emma Watson really needs to cut out the exaggerated head movements. Rupert Grint is a shade better, he has a certain credibility in his performance and should really get more credit. He's a touch above your average child actor.The biggest fun for me is all the great actor cameos from the likes of John Cleese, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, John Hurt and, of course, Richard Harris as Dumbledore. They are definitely the highlight of an otherwise hammy cast.Overall the plot is fairly well-driven and the special effects are nicely handled. John Williams' musical score complements the action well and the script, while presumably taken almost straight from the book, is good, but not great. For non-lovers of the books, it's fun, but nothing more. *** / *****",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
its not worth the piece of paper the ticket was printed on.,If you want a quick and easy way to punish your kids take them to see  Harry Potter. This overlong and boring movie will put them to sleep.  The acting was economy class at best and the plot stank worse than a  moldy anchovie sandwich. The only good thing to come out of the movie  is the undeniable talent of Robbie Coltrane. To bad the man wasted his  talents on this piece of trash.  Chris Columbus just can't direct and newcomer Daniel Radcliffe can't  act. The special effects were actually pretty decent for the film.  I would give this movie 0/10 but there is no zero on the voting so I  had to give it a one.,1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Ultimately, the cons slightly outweigh the pros in a film full of wasted potential","Well, for starters, the older cast, almost all of whom are instantly recognizable if you've seen much of British television or film, are simply delightful in their roles, with special honors going to Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, and Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid. Some other positive aspects to the film is that it is a faithful adaptation for the most part, and the child actors certainly aren't the worst I've ever seen. Moreover, John Williams' brilliant score was at the time one of the best in years.With all this talent at his disposal, Chris Columbus seems almost determined to make the movie as childish and as non-magical as possible. One of the main reasons the Harry Potter books were so successful in the first place was because they really weren't just books for kids, they were books for kids that adults could enjoy. J.K. Rowling created a beautiful, magical world and a bunch of very interesting characters that could keep you interested in reading a book for days, if not weeks. Chris Columbus, however, dumbs it all down to the level that it's not even interesting for two and a half hours. On a superficial level, Columbus might have seemed a good choice to direct; he had been commercially successful in the past, had made some funny comedies (""Home Alone"", ""Mrs. Doubtfire"") and even handle a drama reasonably well (""Bicentennial Man""). However, Columbus has also failed at both those styles before; ""Stepmom"" was manipulative, overly sentimental dreck and ""Nine Months"" simply wasn't funny.Columbus decides to direct this as a kids' movie, and effectively ruins the film in the process. Steve Kloves' script doesn't help either, as it simply plays into Columbus' childish perception with some unbearable slapstick 'humor', which completely destroys most of the novel's charm.There are a couple of solid sequences in this mess of a film, particularly the final scenes, but considering the solid source material and the talent involved, the film is ultimately a failure. It is technically competent and the visual effects are definitely good but unfortunately, in concentrating on the technical aspects, Columbus has wasted a lot of talent and forsaken most of what makes a movie good (acting and writing) for the sake of making the movie merely look good. This may work the first time but the film is a bore on repeated viewings and just doesn't hold up well at all.4/10",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A Surprise,"This first Harry Potter surprised me. Not a reader of the books nor a proponent of occult beliefs, I still went into this with an open mind and found I enjoyed the movie. I watched the first three films and own the third (""Harry Potter and Prisoner Of Azkaban"").This film offered good escapist fare with lots of interesting sets and special- effects, as all the films have done. There is very good color and sound in here, making it even more attractive with a good TV and sound system.Daniel Radcliff was a likable hero, with his round glasses and winsome smile. You can't help but root for him. His friends, played by Rupert Gint and Emma Watson, are okay but Watson gets annoying as the know-it-all school girl. She became more likable in the subsequent Potter films. For me, the British accents in here were not always easy to understand.The story, despite its length of two-and-a-half hours, movies pretty well as there is always something interesting to view. Once again, this movie and the sequels all excelled in this department with great visuals.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Magic Comes To Life!,"Once upon a time (and not that long ago), in the vivid, fertile imagination of author J. K. Rowling, a character was born: A boy. A young boy named Harry, who was destined to become one of the most beloved characters to emerge from a work of fiction in a long, long time, and was quickly embraced by young and old alike in all corners of the world. And now, thanks to the magic of the cinema, Harry and his companions fairly leap from the pages of the novel to the silver screen in the phenomenal motion picture, 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' directed by Chris Columbus and written for the screen by Steve Kloves. Indeed, Harry Potter is a boy, but not just any boy; because Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) just happens to be a wizard. But, orphaned as a baby, Harry has been raised by his Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and Uncle Vernon Dursley (Richard Griffiths), who never let him in on the fact that he was, well-- what he was. It seems that Petunia didn't approve of her own sister-- Harry's mother-- because she was a witch; nor of Harry's father because he, too, was a wizard. When Harry turns eleven, however, the secret is out of the bag when-- after some strange goings-on-- a giant of a man named Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) shows up at the Dursley's door to collect Harry and take him off to 'Hogwarts,' a school for wizards and witches and all who would perfect the gift with which they were born: The gift of magic! And from the moment Harry boards the train (from station platform nine-and-three-quarters) that will take him to his destiny, the magic is alive-- for Harry, and for the audience, as well; and it's a journey you will never forget.What a monumental undertaking to even think of attempting-- translating and transferring this passionately beloved work from novel to the screen. Because to millions of people, Harry and his companions are so much more than merely characters in a book; these are characters for whom people have made a special place in their hearts, which puts a great burden of trust upon the man who would attempt to bring them to life. And Chris Columbus, it turns out, was the right man for the job. More than rising to the occasion and with some magic of his own-- and a lot of help from an extraordinarily talented cast and crew-- Columbus has delivered a film that is not only true to the story, but true to the very spirit that makes Harry Potter so special. The special effects are absolutely beyond astounding, and Columbus, with a keen eye for detail and without missing a beat, keeps it all on track and moving right along at a pace and with a sense of timing that makes this an absorbing, thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable experience from beginning to end. From the opening frame you get the feeling that you're about to have a singular experience; and you're right. Because you've just entered the world of Harry Potter. And it's magic.Even having the best special effects do not a great movie make, however, and this film is no exception; what catapults this one to the top are the performances, beginning with Radcliffe, whom you quickly forget is an actor playing a part. And that about sums up what kind of a job this young man does here. Without question, he IS Harry Potter, physically and emotionally, and when he waves his wand and does what he does, you believe it. A wonderful performance by a gifted actor who has a great career ahead of him; without question the perfect choice for the role of Harry.Also turning in excellent performances are Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson as Hermione. As with Radcliffe, the casting here could not have been more perfect. Grint is 'Everyboy,' with that special glint in his eye and a manner that makes him especially endearing. And the spunky Watson adds some real sparkle to the film as Hermione, the one with the sense of urgency and the wherewithal to get things done; a real role model for young girls everywhere.It's obvious that a lot of care went into the casting of this film, and it's a big part of why it is so successful. Richard Harris, as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore; Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall; John Hurt as Mr. Ollivander; Ian Hart as Professor Quirrell. Exceptional performances from one and all, with two that stand out as especially memorable: Robbie Coltrane, who readily conveys the fact that Hagrid's heart is of a size that matches that of the man; and Alan Rickman, as Professor Severus Snape, deliciously droll while demonstrating menace through the fine art of articulation.The additional supporting cast includes John Cleese (Nearly Headless Nick), Warwick Davis (Professor Flitwick), Julie Walters (Mrs. Weasley), Zoe Wanamaker (Madame Hooch), Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy), Harry Melling (Dudley) and David Bradley (Filch). From Rowling's imagination to the written page to real life (albeit via the movie screen), 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is a triumph many times over; a unique film of truly universal appeal, the likes of which is as rare as, well-- a sorcerer's stone. A film in which adults and children alike will rejoice, because it speaks to the heart in a universal language of life, love, experience and imagination; a film that states unequivocally that magic exists-- as long as there's a single child with a single dream somewhere in the world, and real wizards like J. K. Rowling, Chris Columbus, Steve Kloves and every member of this wonderful cast and crew around to bring it to life as they have here. An instant classic in every sense of the word, this is truly a film for the ages. A remarkable achievement, this IS the magic of the movies. I rate this one 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A bit over rated,"It was a good film with a good plot but by any means wasn't bad. The special effects weren't bad but ok, but this did come out in 2001. The story line wasn't as strong as I would have liked to have seen it but what I do know is the main actors in the first two films weren't great.The casting in general was really good cause from prisoner of Azkaban and onwards, the acting got better and so did the movies but, it wasn't believable. Of course Snape was brilliant!Over rated is an understatement though. There are too many people that now they've seen Harry Potter, won't give any other movies a chance because apparently 'nothing is as good as Harry Potter'. It is a great franchise and everything but apparently they can't see anything else. Most people won't give other films like my personal favourites, lord of the rings and the hobbit, a chance because 'it's not harry potter'. I'm not against liking this franchise but am against because you like it you can't like anything else.Not the best movie out of the eight made but from prisoner of Azkaban and onwards are great!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
This movie is okay.,"Of all the Harry Potter's movies, I guess the ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' was the more more expected of all. I was one of the thousands of teenagers who wanted to watch this movie so badly and I watched it in the first week it came here in Brazil. After 4 Harry Potter's movies, now I feel comfortable to say that the first movie is the one I liked the least. Maybe because it is the one who has less adventure or danger of all, but I cannot say exactly why. I think it will be very difficult for me, being crazy for Harry Potter's books, to give 10 in any of the H.P.'s movies, since the book is SO MUCH better than any of the films. I mean, MANY great parts are never showed in the movies.

Where it all began.,"With the sixth book now out (and one more to go), I feel that I should review ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"". By now, the Harry Potter books have become so well entrenched in our culture that I don't even need to explain the story. But I can say that director Chris Columbus did a great job adapting the book to the silver screen.The cast does very well with the roles: newcomer Daniel Radcliffe plays Harry Potter, making him strong-willed but vulnerable. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson play his friends, the uptight Ron Weasley and the no-nonsense Hermione Granger. The Hogwarts staff is played by a who's-who of British actors: Richard Harris as headmaster Albus Dumbledore, Maggie Smith as anthropomorphic Prof. Minerva McGonagall (and one can detect a hint of Miss Jean Brodie there), Alan Rickman as unctuous Prof. Severus Snape, and Robbie Coltrane as gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid. Others include Zoe Wanamaker as Quidditch teacher Madame Hooch, Julie Walters as Molly Weasley (Ron's mum), Richard Griffiths as Vernon Dursley (Harry's mean uncle) and even John Cleese as Nearly-Headless-Nick, one of the school ghosts.All in all, this is a movie for the ages. I know that religious fundamentalists will claim that the Harry Potter books are promoting witchcraft, but are we really going to believe those kinds of people, considering that they claimed the same things about ""Bewitched""?

HP 1,"So, to set the scene a little bit, I believe this is the third time I've seen this movie. I read the nearly all the books when they came out and watched just the first one when it released and then, over lockdown pounded out the whole series. Thought I'd come back to it again and give it a more critical eye.The Somebody's Stone is an interesting film. There's so much nostalgia here for me and I can't help but enjoy that and yet, I never find myself drawn into this one. It's a decent introduction but it feels off to me every time. It has this odd mixture of young and mature themes that I don't think quite hit their perfect balance yet, though an argument could be made that as the movies progress so to do their maturity and intricacies to match the plot but still, as a single film this feels like a child's movie with childish issues. The child actors, for a start, are going a bit over the top and it feels like we could use a Looney Tunes sound effects track to go with some of the things happening here. Also, I can't help but be annoyed by the wish fulfillment involved. Poor orphan boy is suddenly the chosen one and becomes a huge deal at school, wildly popular and rich in both gold and friends without ever even trying!That all may sound like I'm really bagging on this but I don't mean to. I still think this is a good movie but every time I see it I'm reminded of why I abandoned the series so early on upon it's original release.

Entertaining but not satisfying.,"With the movie finally here out in the open it's hard to say if expectations weren't too high. It all sounded good: a fine cast & J.K. Rowling being mainly involved. Could this go wrong?Well, yes and no. First of all: the cast is fine, the adultcast is great even (with Hagrid being my favorite and a fabulous John Hurt as mr. Ollivander). The kids are fine too, Emma Watson does a great job als Hermione. The locations look great, Hogwarth's is fabulous - with the floating pumpkins at Halloween as a subtle highlight. And of course, after reading the books, it's fun to see it all for a change. Then there are scenes that are truly fascinating, like quidditch, the dark forest and the chess-play. John Williams's music is very good. So, there *is* a lot to enjoy. And the computer-generated moving stairs are beautiful. But even in this movie the most scary element (invisible Voldemort in a black cloak drinking unicornblood and threatening Harry) is just a piece of black cloth. As where the CGI-troll wasn't scary at all.The major lack in the movie is it's pace. It's too fast. There is simply too much to tell and the movie can't choose between plot (what is the philosopher's stone and who wants to steal it) and simply showing Harry's life on Hogwarth's (school, quidditch, magic). It's clear that a 2.5 hour movie cannot do this both properly. Sometimes it feels like we're zapping through Harry's life, and the fact that the events in the movie take about a year doesn't come through at all.I believe this all comes from the involvement of J.K. Rowling and the filmmaker's idea to stick as close to the book as possible. The movie is indeed close to the book, too close I think. Someone like Spielberg - who didn't get the job - would have made the story more into a movie and less into a combination of scenes.With this movie, you keep feeling like you are on the sideline, looking in on Harry's life, where you should be drawn in to his world, like in the books. Now it's just a bunch of nice pictures, changing quickly and leaving me unsatisfied and longing for the warm long lasting bath the books are.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

In terms of genre, I would say that it is fantasy with elements of comedy and drama. Very high quality film music. The film can create a beautiful fairy tale atmosphere.

The nostalgia is real,"All the Harry Potter films stand consistently at a high standard, but this one sticks out a bit as without it, the world and the magic of the other films wouldn't be there.Chris Columbus does such a good job at setting up this world whilst simultaneously introducing the characters and telling its own story. It's great watching the characters discover Hogwarts, play Quidditch, learn spells hatch dragon eggs and play wizards chess. Not to mention all the magic chocolates and gizmos and immersive set and costume designs that really capture your imagination as a child and as an adult. And on top of this you get to follow the characters on figuring out the mystery of the Philosopher's stone, who Voldermort is and why Harry is so special.The vibe needed to be set and Columbus does a great job at giving us that magical feeling you get as a kid, which is very fitting considering the main characters are so young.This makes the film more impressive, as you can watch this at whatever age and still be as invested, even though the main characters are children you still feel so connected to them.Not to mention it's extremely nostalgic and cool to look at all the stuff I saw in Harry Potter world on the screen. That score is so nostalgic too, obviously the main one but also the one that plays as Harry stares out the window that first night.Nearly 5 stars for me, could change soon.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Little sense of struggle or danger to keep you on the edge of your seat.,"(I have described certain elements of structure and plot but in general terms that I hope will not spoil the story for those who don't know it)I expected a roller coaster ride, but was instead taken on a rather pedestrian stroll around the world of Harry Potter. Of course, if I'd seen this film as a young child, I would have been thrilled to bits with this escape into a world where children learn to be wizards and witches.Having read all the books to my son, I'm not a big fan. But I did think Harry Potter's story could be made into a series of fantastic movies. In my opinion, that opportunity has been wasted. For me, the structure of the screenplay was poor, devised to please several million expectant fanatics. Because the creators of the movie had their audience on a plate, they didn't have to worry about drawing anyone into the story. So we get a series of events designed not to disappoint those coming to see their favorite bits from the book.The beginning of the film can be compared to that of Time Bandits - young boy with nasty parents taken into another world. But whereas I was right with the boy in Time Bandits, drawn into his story by the skill of the film makers, I was only a spectator as the bizarre series of events unfold in Harry's life. I didn't really get a feeling of Harry's misery while living with the Dursleys.Bearing in mind what you can achieve with digital effects these days, the makers of this film created little sense of great magic. A big let-down when you're watching a film about magicians. I think this film lacks the sense of awe and wonder that a director like Spielberg could have created. In fact, I felt very little emotion throughout the whole film.It's strange that, with 2 1/2 hours to play with, I didn't really get a great deal from any of the characters. The film relies completely on the three children at the centre of the story, with the others popping up every now and then. Unfortunately, Harry is up-staged by his companions. There is hardly an indication that the evil Harry has to defeat is actually present until the end. So I didn't find the sense of struggle or danger that would have kept me on the edge of my seat.In all, this film failed to touch me. I wanted to be there with Harry as he went from suburban misery to the wonderful Hogwarts. But I just didn't connect with him. I believe this is due, mainly, to the structure and design of the screenplay. The tame direction and some wooden acting in places didn't help.It will of course make zillions and thrill children across the globe for many years to come.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

The story was occasionally creative, but primarily built on cliches. In other words, average.I can't understand why so many reviews are so glowing. Critics seem reluctant to give a thumbs down to just adequate children's movies. Maybe that's because they feel it's their civic duty to encourage such a movement in Hollywood. But why such praise for a children's movie with a controversial edge? - a movie that's guaranteed to raise eyebrows of religious parents?Not that I had a problem with that.

The unfinished movie.,"I really liked reading the Harry Potter-stories, but this movie has so many shortcomings that I have given it a 3/10.After watching it, I got the impression that this movie was a rush-job altogether. Some scenes OBVIOUSLY needed more takes and I can't imagine John Williams will like what they've done with his music. The music and the scenes look as if they are from two completely different movies.I'm too shocked still to know where to begin expressing what is wrong with this movie. *sigh*I can imagine that you have to leave things from a book in its conversion to the silver screen. Time constraints amongst other things are important factors. But in this adaptation they've really torn the book to shreds. For instance, the book contains a lot of 'funny bits' to give the reader some 'light relief'. Done away with in the movie. Also, there seems to be no place in the movie for some 'rest' for the viewer. No space for 'suspense to build'. BAM! BAM! BAM! and important bits of imformation sacrificed for the fast score.All in all, my opinion of this movie is really low.

Loved the Movie,"It seems that some that had the fortune to read the Harry Potter books before seeing the movie (I am not one of them), did not like the movie much even though they kept to the book very well.I loved the movie, and was very happy that they introduced the characters in the first of a possible 7 movie series (Chris Columbus mentioned 7 movies on the Sorcerer's Stone extras).  With that many coming out, why not introduce the characters in the first movie.I read the book after seeing the movie and saw that they not only stuck to the book, they put in most of the parts I liked (except the color flames at the end).I enjoyed the second movie (chamber of Secrets) even more, yet I have not read the book.  And look forward to the rest of the books to come to life.I for one and am sure many others that feel the same way, it is nice to see the Harry Potter books come to life, and the Actors that were chosen to play the characters were perfect.Chris Columbus is a great Director/Producer.  He has made many other movies that I own and enjoyed and was great to see him do this movie.Good Job Everyone!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Classic,"How can you not root for Harry Potter?  In one scene, we establish him as the 2nd saddest child in cinematic history (the saddest being Charlie from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory): seeing a kid drawing his own birthday cake in dirt.  My God, I was practically traumatized watching this. The first 30 minutes of child abuse was crushing my poor heart, and then the cake scene.  I honestly wouldn't have objected to Harry becoming a hatchet murderer at that point--you couldn't have made me side against him. So, to witness him go on and discover his roots in magic, and actually find happiness in that world?  I was all for it....but I still wanted to beat the tar out of the Dursleys.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Quite boring,"The first chapter of the saga is boring and too much for children, for heaven's sake it must be for children, but in my opinion it is too stupid and senseless and therefore it is a film that is too naive and boring at times.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Too literal, decidedly non-magical bore","About halfway through Harry Potter 1, I considered walking out.  It's not that it was godawful, but having read the book, I knew how it all worked out-- and I had no confidence left that there would be anything the least bit interesting about how Rowling's story would be illustrated.That's what it is; the book faithfully, and dully, illustrated, line by line.  It's so faithful to the order of incidents (and the need to keep the story moving) that it has no time to give us any of the characterization that made us root for Harry; at best we get instantly recognizable movie stereotypes (Draco Malfoy has a Richie Rich 'do, therefore he must be from the same snotty rich kids' fraternity as Greg Marmalard).  Seemingly ideal casting-- Alan Rickman as Snape, say-- is wasted when the characters turn out only to have half a dozen lines in the entire movie, most of them expository.  Maggie Smith, Ian Hart, Richard Griffiths, Fiona Shaw, all wasted; the peerless John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick has, as memory serves, all of two lines-- one to explain why he's nearly headless, and one to announce, in Boys' Own Weekly cliches, that the Quidditch Cup is sure going to be hotly contested this year.  Maybe only Robbie Coltrane and John Hurt get enough dialogue to begin to sketch a character.The other problem-- not unrelated, surely-- is that Chris Columbus is, for the millionth time, the wrong wrong wrong director for the job.  He has no sense of magic, of mystery, of English eccentricity.  Give him two wizards skulking about a suburban tract house, and he'll make them seem as ordinary as two retirees strolling and chatting about the weather.  Give him an evil spirit sucking the blood of a dead unicorn and being interrupted by a centaur, and he makes it seem like two retirees strolling and chatting about the weather.  Give him a chess game, and he makes it seem like World War III.  Give him Gringott's bank, and he ignores the baroque set that's been built and can't wait to show us a big pile of gold, which is surely a bit revealing.  This isn't as awful a blockbuster as, say, Tomb Raider, but it comes from the same land of impoverished imagination camouflaged with booming, expensive yet somehow cheap-looking special effects.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

a magical classic,"Lets assume you haven't read the harry potter franchise...
this film is a great kids movie about magic. Enjoyable also for adults yet is obviously targeted at younger audiences. It is important to note that Harry Potter ages with his fanbase. So as he gets older the movies become more mature, scarier, and darker. But this one is mostly just a fun family film. The protagonist is an orphan who through out the movie finds out that he's part of something that's way bigger than himself. Mostly the story surrounds around Harry and his two friends that keep getting in trouble and add a lot of humor into the movie. There are ghosts and other creepy creatures that show up throughout the movie yet most scenes are not too scary for young kids. The sets are beautiful, the soundtrack is immersive and compelling, effects were good for its time, actors were very dedicated , and overall WB just did a good job to start off the franchise.

A Magical Journey into the Heart of Storytelling,"""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is a cinematic marvel that transports us into a realm of magic and mystery. The film, based on J. K. Rowling's beloved novel, is a visual spectacle that brings the enchanting world of Harry Potter to life.The film's greatest strength lies in its meticulous attention to detail. Every setting, from the quaint, cobblestone streets of Diagon Alley to the awe-inspiring grandeur of Hogwarts, is crafted with such precision that it feels as if we've stepped into the pages of the book. The characters, too, are portrayed with a depth and authenticity that make them feel real and relatable.What sets this film apart is its ability to capture the essence of the book while adding a new dimension to the story. The visual effects and cinematography enhance the narrative, providing a sensory experience that a book simply cannot offer. Scenes like the first Quidditch match or the encounter with the three-headed dog, Fluffy, are made all the more thrilling through the magic of cinema.The performances are another highlight of the film. The cast, led by Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson, deliver performances that embody the spirit of their characters. Their portrayal brings a depth to the characters that complements the detailed world-building.In conclusion, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is a film that not only does justice to its source material but also enhances it. It's a film that invites us into a new world, introduces us to unforgettable characters, and leaves us yearning for more. It's not just a movie, but a magical journey that captivates and enchants from start to finish.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Enjoyable mixture of fantasy and comedy,"HP is very enjoyable. It has several features that make it a good film; the story- which is about magic, evil and friendship. This story works really well- I had read the book before watching it, and thought that it was a very good adaptation.The stars of the movie, though Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson are not very impressive the rest of the cast are wonderful- especially Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, and Zoe Wanamaker. (It was good that all the actors were British).The chess scene was a highlight of the film, also the twists and turns of the plot were done well.I feel that the use of bluescreen effects and CGI were overly used, some of the effects were not good and you could tell that they were not outside etc. Other than that piont I cant complain, though I do think that younger people will prefer it more, maybe under 16.I have thought a long and hard about what rating to give it, there are a mixture and positives and negatives. Children will really enjoy it. *******7 out of 10*******",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The boy who lived,"Harry Potter, a seemingly normal 11 year old boy soon discovers that there is far more to the world and himself then he ever imagined. Famous for an incident at his birth he soon discovers the world of magic as he is invited and attends Hogwarts, a school for witchcraft and wizardry. While there he learns that not all wizards are those to be trusted and there are those still serve an old evil, an old evil that wants Harry Potter dead.Based off the acclaimed series by J.K. Rowling, Chris Columbus directs the first of the series. Touching, heartfelt and innocent is one way to describe the first of the series, lighthearted in its enjoyment and in its scope, one feels after watching this film that they've barely scraped the surface of the world of magic and muggles and one would be right in making that assessment. John Williams scores the film beautifully and the entire score itself feels like a part of the magic that is this film. The child actors mainly Radcliffe, Grint and Watson do a marvelous job and the chemistry between the three cant be denied by the viewer at at any point. Alan Rickman, who plays the sinister Snape is wonderful in his role and is easily one of the many who do a wonderful job within the film. The late Richard Harris also does a magnificent job as does Maggie Smith. One cant help but be inexplicably drawn to the film, it almost feels as though you are let in on a secret, one in which you are glad to be a part of. While some would argue that the first of the series is perhaps a bit to childish in its nature, i disagree and say it is the most care free of the series, a good introduction piece into a series that only gets darker and more adult as they go. For any fan of fantasy, or any fan of film in general the first Harry Potter film is a true gem and one I'm glad to have watched.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

The 'Wizard of Oz' of a different generation,"Much like the film in said title, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone seems to essentially be a nice kind of kiddy escapism flick into the world of magic, but like The Wizard of Oz, it still manages to be surprisingly touchy in a profoundly humanistic kind of way despite its far fetched story.I grew up with these series, and thought they were the greatest thing i have ever seen at the time. Now that i have grown older and judge all cinematic feats objectively, Sorcerer's Stone might have lost some of its figurative magic, but it is still an impressive and genuinely entertaining film. After having recently been through the torture of seeing the entire Twilight saga series, it is nice to see a film series such as Harry Potter that DOES actually have great writing and for the most part good acting, and manages to be believeable in the setting it provides. Dumbledore, who is the most important character in the film, and his dialogue with Harry in front of the mirror shows us that the film manages to still be relevant to actual family values and issues while subtly lying under its gorgeous magical cover.Visually the film is stunning due to the fact that the filmmakers wanted to give it that authentic look, resulting in many on location shots. The outdoor shot of the first time seeing Hogwharts is simply visual delight in what could have easily been an ugly CGI snoozefest. The great hall ( Which was not on location and actually built for the film ) is also fantastic visual beauty, and the high camera angles show us a great overview of the entire room while this is coupled with John Williams's fantastic score, which uses fantastic chords of joy and happiness in the light hearted scenes while still maintaining that ominous mystery feel in the darker scenes, such as the Unicorn search in the dark forest. Williams's score for this film is definitely one of the greatest in the history of film due to the fact that it captures the adventure, joy, mystery & evil of the film like no other.Its three main characters Harry, Ron & Hermione, who were ofcourse still very young child actors at the time, are surprisingly genuinely enthusiastic and natural about the happenings in the film, and while they will never be the true star of it, they definitely do not drag the film down. However, there are indeed fantastic acting performances in the film, especially by Alan Rickman ( Snape ) whose subtle slow way of speaking is intimidating in its own right, and Richard Harris ( Dumbledore ), who captures the wise and friendly aspect of his character as only Harris can, with his calm demeanor and naturally fatherly character, which only makes it sadder he passed away before the making of the Prisoner of Azkaban, as a Dumbledore as good as Richard Harris's will never be seen.The narrative of the film is great, with us slowly beginning to understand more about the plot as it unfolds. It doesn't insult any type of audience with obvious dialogue or flashbacks ( *Cough* Twilight * Cough* ) and instead lets the mystery unfold into logic on its own. All three main characters embody their characters perfectly as each is used to the best of their abilities throughout an event in the story, which will make sure none of them seem irrelevant, and all of them give a clear view of what they are like.It is a grandiose spectacle of visuals and magic, and while obviously lacking in real depth it is also a genuinely human story about an orphan ( Harry ) who finds friendship and courage through a series of brave events.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
We're Off to See the Wizard,"""Harry Potter learns, on his 11th birthday, that he is the orphaned son of two powerful wizards, and possesses magical powers of his own. (Sent to) 'Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry', Harry embarks on the adventure of a lifetime, discovering a world of magic and fantasy, where he is destined to live,"" according to the film's official synopsis. This was the first of the films bringing J.K. Rowling's beloved ""Harry Potter"" characters to motion picture life; and, it must be considered a rousing success.Importantly, Ms. Rowling insisted on retaining much creative control, so a higher than usual amount of integrity to the material is maintained. This doesn't benefit the film in every respect; but, it certainly was, in hindsight, the only sure-fire way to introduce these adventures to cinema. One change, done for the book, was that the title would be altered from ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" to ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" for U.S. consumption; it goes against the grain, and works perfectly. ""Sorcerer's Stone"" is shorter, provides alliteration, and better illustrates the conflict present in the story.Initially, it wasn't obvious that the young trio playing ""Harry"", ""Ron"", and ""Hermione"" had the acting ability to go along with looking right for the leading roles; fortunately, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson would turn out to be just perfect. Richard Harris (as Albus Dumbledore) and Maggie Smith (as Minerva McGonagall) herald a stellar parade of Brits playing throughout the ""Potter"" films, with Robbie Coltrane (as Rubeus Hagrid) going to the head of this, the first class.******** Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (11/4/01) Chris Columbus ~ Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Robbie Coltrane",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

A Magical Classic - Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,"I recently revisited the enchanting world of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and it was just as captivating as ever. Director Chris Columbus truly brought J. K. Rowling's magical universe to life with his impeccable direction.The story, which serves as our introduction to the Wizarding World, is nothing short of perfection. From the moment we meet young Harry, we are drawn into a world filled with wonder and mystery. The story effortlessly balances the ordinary and the extraordinary, making it relatable to both wizards and Muggles alike.What sets this film apart is its ability to transport viewers to a place where magic is real and anything is possible. The special effects, from the magical creatures to the breathtaking Quidditch match, are still impressive even years after the film's release.But it's not just the magic and visuals that make this film great; it's the heartwarming friendships, the lessons of bravery and loyalty, and the battle between good and evil that resonate with audiences of all ages. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is more than just a movie; it's an enchanting journey that reminds us of the power of love and friendship.Whether you're a devoted Potterhead or a first-time viewer, this film is a timeless classic that will continue to capture hearts for generations to come. Don't miss the chance to experience the magic all over again or for the very first time. It's a delightful adventure from start to finish.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Solid Start to the Franchise,"Having just reviewed Order of The Phoenix I thought I'd better add a few comments about the previous movies. Each time I see a new Harry Potter film I'm tempted to say ""Gosh, how they've grown""! It seems a long time ago now that the first in the series appeared.And a recent viewing confirms what I've always thought about this film; the casting couldn't have been better. The young leads, Radcliffe, Grint and Watson are fine, and a wonderful ensemble of actors lend enjoyable support. Could you imagine anyone other than Robbie Coltrane playing Hagrid? Alan Rickman is also perfectly cast as Professor Snape. And I haven't even mentioned Richard Harris and Maggie Smith yet! It's a huge shame Harris is no longer with us to appear in the series; Michael Gambon gives a different interpretation to Dumbledore, and frankly I don't think he's nailed the role as well as Harris. I've yet to see Maggie Smith give a bad performance. This film is no exception.I'm not going to discuss the plot - it's too well known to need comment, but there are some narrative problems with the film. It's a little unfocused for much of it's length, but this can be forgiven as it has to set the scene and balance the story for the audience members unfamiliar with the book. The effects are nicely done and John Williams' main theme grows on you. I didn't care much for his score when the film came out but will cheerfully admit to being in error. It isn't his best work but is still of a very high standard indeed. The effects are also fine - I particularly liked Firenze. Yeah, it's all CGI but it suits the tone of the material.One has to say the film is a little bland; the studio obviously did not want to take too many risks with the book's legion of fans, but it does it job - to entertain and set things up for the following films. Chris Columbus directs adequately but without adding any real flavour to things.All things considered: a respectable and solid start to the series.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Great ambience, but not a perfect film","The film captures very well the required ambience, it does not appear phony as so many genre rivals do. The set pieces are marvellous. Robbie Coltrane makes a perfect Haggrit and generally the casting is fine, except perhaps Ian Hart as Quirrel; I also would have chosen someone younger than Maggie Smith for the McGonagall part, say Haydn Gwynne.However, the film is too long.  It tries to juggle too many balls, keep too many plot elements and characters from the book [which I read _after_ seeing the film] - and there just is not enough room for it, not even in a two-and-a-half hour long movie.  As a result, some characters (notably Draco Malfoy) remain underdeveloped and some elements (e.g. Quidditch) which add weight to the whole school experience as the book brings it across are reduced to the bare minimum for the purposes of the story and consequently increase the predictability of the plot.Bigger sacrifices should have been made to focus on depth rather than breadth.  For example, one might have scrapped the school cup altogether.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Almost Magical,"Rewatching ""The Sorcerers Stone"" after several years of watching the later more polished entries sort of feels like comparing the 1988 BBC edition of ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" to the most recent 2005 version. It feels a little dated, a little slow and clunky, but it still has a little nostalgic charm for those who grew up watching them, and for that reason alone I can't give this film anything less than three stars.

"Awful, to say the least.","I've read the book only to see what all the hype's about. I must admit I was pleasantly surprised. It was a very easy book to follow and dares to be nothing more than it actually is - a plain old nothing-new-under-the-sun children's book. In that, Rowling did a fine job. Snippets from Lord of the Rings, Dracula, Ender's Game, to name a few, were bluntly used throughout the book and meshed together to form this trashy, 2 cents of a fantasy story. Oh well, as long as it keeps my children reading.But the movie... oh, well, now that's plain sad. I don't recall ever seeing such forced adaptation of a book to a movie. Everything about this movie is wrong. The younger actors act so bad they seem to take part of some sorry school play, the CG effects are ridiculously unrealistic, the script is just a scribble of the original book's text rather than telling an actual story. And the list goes on.The fact that Rowling insisted on having only British actors seem to have been the first mine laid on a shaggy path to a bearable movie. Steven Spielberg (who was offered the job) could have done a much better job in directing just as much as Haley Joel Osment (6th Sense, who was suggested by Spielberg for the part) could have been a MUCH more convincing Harry Potter. A whole lot of the experience was missed, as the rest was brutally murdered by idiotic idealism by the author. Plain sad.The worst part is that such a horror of a movie had earned so much money to its makers. Kinda blows away all wishes of becoming a good, hard-working director... it seems that skill has nothing to do with success. :)It deserves nothing more than 1/10.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

"Not a terrible adaptation to this popular series, but pretty mediocre","From what I can remember this movie has a lot of the parts in the book in the actual movie. The thing is the way the movie is executed seemed lame and poorly executed. Some scenes were done pretty well but overall it was a boring experience to sit through this whole movie. It isn't a terrible book to movie adaptation, but it just wasn't that good. A lot of movies isn't as good as the novels it is based on or adapted into and this movie is mediocre at best. And if I review this movie without reading the book, I would probably give it a lower score. Since it's this franchise that kept me interested although I am not a fan of Harry Potter novels. On a positive note I liked how almost every character looked the way I imagined them to look. The acting in this movie however is atrocious, it was like watching a live version of of a Saturday morning cartoon show. Except few of them that was alright or could actually somewhat act.

It's Grown On Me,"Despite being part of the generation that grew up with these books/films I was never particularly a big fan of Harry Potter the way so many others were. I saw the films on TV every now and then and found them mildly entertaining but they never managed to truly win me over. At the time I was more of a fan of the lesser appreciated Chronicles of Narnia series of films.I had watched the Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts a few years ago and found it quite enjoyable so with it being twenty years since the original film's release, what better time to revisit it and give it another go?Upon rewatch I was pleasantly surprised and found myself enjoying it more now than I did all those years ago as a child, ironic given it's intended target audience. I liked the sense of mystery in the story and how our protagonists uncover the conspiracy within Hogwarts, leading up to the big confrontation at the end which was also done very well. This first film also has much more whimsical and lighthearted moments compared to later films in the series which depending on your personal tastes could be a good or bad thing.Where the film really shines is in it's characters and the actor's portrayals of them. The young cast of course do a fairly good job, with Radcliffe being the perfect fit for Harry. There are also some great performances from the older cast members such as Robbie Coltrane as the gentle (half) giant Hagrid, the late Alan Rickman as the stern and intimidating Professor Snape and of course the late Richard Harris as the wise and gentle yet powerful wizard Professor Dumbledore who sadly passed away after the second film and as such could not play the role in the following films.After rewatching this first Harry Potter film so many years later I had a newfound appreciation for it and the series as a whole.

A Captivating Portal to a Magical World,"""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" isn't just a movie; it's a portal to a world brimming with magic. Director Chris Columbus masterfully avoids the pitfall of turning J. K. Rowling's beloved novel into a saccharine spectacle. Instead, he crafts a thrilling adventure that captures the wonder and danger of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.The film's atmosphere is its strongest spell. Hogwarts, with its gothic architecture and fantastical details, feels both imposing and inviting. Stepping through the castle's gates is like stepping into a meticulously crafted illustration come to life, a testament to the film's effective blend of practical effects and CGI.Columbus deserves credit for staying true to the source material. The movie respects the story and characters, offering a faithful adaptation that both newcomers and returning fans can appreciate. The young leads, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint, deliver performances that are both charming and believable. They embody Harry, Hermione, and Ron perfectly, capturing their essence and forging a believable friendship onscreen.The film boasts several set pieces that are as thrilling as they are visually stunning. The Quidditch match, a fast-paced game played on flying broomsticks, is a highlight, putting viewers right in the heart of the action. The encounter with the three-headed dog, Fluffy, is another memorable scene, showcasing the film's ability to balance humor and suspense.While the film stays true to the core of the story, there are some compromises made for its cinematic format. Pacing can feel uneven at times, with certain portions condensed to fit the runtime. This inevitably leads to a loss of depth compared to the novel, as some character development and plot details are sacrificed.Despite these minor shortcomings, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is a captivating introduction to the wizarding world. It's a film that takes its time to tell a story and carefully craft its characters, much like the classic films it evokes, such as ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Star Wars."" With its enchanting atmosphere, faithful adaptation, and engaging performances, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" earns its place as a modern classic, sure to captivate audiences for generations to come.7.35/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

GOOD FUN!! But is Harry is going to Hell?!,"Unlike so many who have posted here, I have not only never read a single Harry Potter book, I have never seen nor touched one, nor barely heard of the children's book character until this film came out. So I am in fine position to evaluate the movie on its own merits without any invidious comparisons to published books and the events therein.Having gone to the theater on the recommendation of a friend, I had no idea what to expect, or whether, as an adult, I would like it, be bored - or be sickened. I was pleasantly surprised.It has all the elements children love: empowerment especially over adults; secret passageways; cryptic messages and meanings; camaraderie with close friends (especially as a surrogate family); and the occasional monster. But besides all that, I found it to be enjoyable magical fun, and I too got swept up in the adventure, and in the whimsy of such as a secret street for wizards and magicians.Of course, the school villains are two-dimensional at best, and we've seen their like going back to ""Tom Brown's Schooldays"". This is the weakest element of the script.I do have to wonder about all the wizardry and witchcraft in a world devoid of God resulting in one way tickets to Hell for all of them.

My Revenge for the Non Fans!!,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, as it is called everywhere else besides the US, and I'd like to know why, is no more than a 5th rate failure at best.  Now I know I'm probably enraging every single person who has read the novel, however this movie is not the novel.  Book and Film are two totally different mediums.  Something that works in a novel, wont decessarily work on the big screen.  Harry Potter is the greatest example of that.Colombus decided to change very, very little in his adaptation of the novel, which is the movie's greatest fault.  An author has the luxury to spend pages and pages describing a certain image in a story; a film does not have that kind of luxury.  The movie was terribly boring due to the fact that Colombus tried to pace the movie the same way as the book.  That is an impossible feat.  The movie is not meant to be some companion to the novel. If that was the truth, then the 7 billion people who havent read the novel wouldnt even bother showing up to watch.  A movie is supposed to have a broad audience in order to make money, if Colombus feels that he is only making the movie to please Potter fans, then AOL Time Warner will have a huge failure on their hands.  I've never read the book, and some may say that that is the reason why I didnt enjoy the movie.  But again, I went to see a movie, not read a book.  The Godfather is not a classic because it stayed true to Puzo's novel.  It is a classic because Coppola knew what elements would need to be changed in order to make the book filmable. Colombus doesnt have a clue.The only thing good about Harry Potter was the cinematography.  Most of the film looked brilliant, especially Hogwarts itself.  Yet, a visually pleasing film does not make the film suddenly good.  It doesnt even come close.  The effects are just a testament to the fact that Colombus got his priorities way wrong when he filmed this boring, plodding paced movie.  I voted it a one, I was feeling generous.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
That was a great adventure to magic world!,"When I watched this movie at the first time I wasn't really aware what is it about. I was only ten years old, at the age when everyone believes that magic is real, that his or her own fantasies and most wild dreams can finally come true.
As I remember this film was one of the first films arranged for children around 7-12 years old, so it was like present for me.
Set in early nineties, this story takes place in London. The plot revolved around Harry Potter, whose parents where murdered by one of the greatest dark wizards of all time Lord Voldemord. Despite the fact that he was with his mother when she died, he survived, the fact that made him famous in wizarding world. He used to live with his cruel relatives, Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, but now he is about to leave their house to learn magic in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Daniel Radcliffe, actor who played titular protagonist, despite the fact that he was only twelve when first of Harry Potter movies released, could perfectly show all emotions little Harry felt all over this story. As movie about magic, it is exciting and breathtaking, with perfect decorations and interesting plot twists. It has bewitching magical effects, that makes you believe in reality of what is happening. A bonus is perfectly matched themes, like well-known ""Hedwig Theme"". The adventures of little boy and his friends will grab you out and never leave you until movie ends.
This is one of the best films about magic in many years. Not one generation grown watching this movie. I hardly advice you to watch it and plunge in atmosphere of Witchcraft and Wizardry.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A wonderful little first... chapter?,"Nope, haven't read any of the books. Even so, I can appreciate a film that's well done. The smallest version of the little kids is delightful. They didn't all age well (I'm looking at you, Rupert). The kids did a great job at portraying their respective characters. This sole performance of the original Dumbledore was sublime. His replacement in subsequent films didn't hold a candle to the original. His passing was ill timed indeed. This particular inaugural chapter is rather nostalgic to me, because it was released when my kids were little. I miss those days (older kids have greater difficulties). Christopher Cross directed the children like a true professional. Even my now adult children maintain a special fondness for The Sorcerer's Stone. It remains, and ever will, a staple in our hard copy collection.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Instant Classic - No matter what is the year you watch it,"After my Nine years old daughter almost finished to read all of Harry Potter's books it seemed like the right time to start with the movies or a least with the first and the less scary or inappropriate for young kids.I think that I have seen it several times, but now it was even more special, to watch it with the kids and my own Hermione Granger, that was willing to Spoil(er) the plot for her brothers.Anyway, it is one of a few cases which the book gets a fantastic translation to a movie and as a film, which you try to disconnect from the book series, it is still an outstanding creation, almost a myth.It is for kids, but two hours and a half long. It has some moments of scare, but it is a perfect interpretation, which contains the Drama, fun and funny bits and even the scary moments, which the book made you feel.I liked it now even more, based on my personal life's surrounding, but even then, when I wasn't a father yet and just a reader who seek to find a good movie to this iconic story, it had made it and delivered.Once delivered, now still delivers...probably it will last for another 20 years and still deliver.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Glamour without a whole soul,"There are so many book to movie adaptations that have failed to meet the grand expectations of their predecessors we could go on counting forever. Nearly.  Harry Potter is quite unique in how well it follows the father plot to the T.  Therein lies its greatest fault; Harry Potter the movie is a testament as to why most science-fiction and fantasy books will never see the silver screen: they have way too much stuff going on for a cohesive time slot, even at 2 1/2 hours.Even with all of the effects, the casual viewer and the book-thumper sense that something is missing.  There is a whole lot going on, but there isn't much feeling behind it.  Whereas other films (Six-string Samurai and Buckaroo Bonzai) have managed to carry their obsurd worlds quite nicely, Harry's is hackneyed and stilted, leaning heavily on the reader to fill in the blanks like a ridiculously long mad lib.This film is so difficult to rate as a result of the above.  Yes, I really enjoyed the books, but no, the film is a clock-watcher at times.Overall, 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Why hadn't I seen this already?,"I think I may sound like a stooge if I say this, but it is now that I have finally watched this movie. Throughout my life - school days, college, internet; I often used to see people going non-stop about Harry Potter (I think they are called Potterheads). Harry Potter this, Harry Potter that. So finally yesterday I decided to give it a try and oh my god, it's amazing! Why didn't I see it back when I had the chance to?It is kinda unbelieveable that such a nicely detailed CGI movie was released in 2001. I know the VFX had grown a lot better since Lord of the Rings trilogy was also made at the same time, but still I was not prepared for it. I was expecting it to be just some regular CGI that didn't age too well. Trust me, if you haven't watched the movie till now, it hasn't aged at all. It can very much still be the selling point of the movie.I had watched some parts of the movie, like the beginning where Harry's cousin was brought back home after he fell in the snake's cage and the Quidditch scene, but I didn't have any powerful memory of any other scene from the movie. In the scene where Voldemort says to the professor, ""Kill him!"" somehow I used to remember that scene to be the teacher first saying ""What should I do?"" to which Voldemort replies that. And I'm glad I didn't have any previous memory of this movie, because that way I was able to experience everything for the first time.This movie has the 2001 movie's vibe to it, where the story is very straightforward and the childish background music makes it seem very easy to understand. I haven't seen any other movie of the franchise, as I'm going to watch the next part after writing this review. But I hope it stays that way, since it's very easy to understand and thus I can watch the movie on my phone while doing my work on my laptop.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Great at the time and still has something special about it.,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is probably my favourite film from the franchise, though this is largely for nostalgic reasons, it definitely has strengths. Richard Harris' Dumbledore is calm and wise, as he should be, we trust and revere him implicitly, Snape (Rickman) has the appropriate level of menacing sweep, his opening scene is arguably the highlight of the entire series as he informs us, quivering in our over-sized robes in our first week, that we can learn how to put a stopped in death, and Emma Watson is delightfully bossy as Hermione. She is, of the main three, the one who shines throughout all, with arguably the hardest part, she brings emotion, intelligence and a hefty helping of guts to a well-loved character. The film is not big and brash, unlike some its successors, it is simple and relies on the quality of the story being told and the actors doing that. It makes little or no go at impressing the audience, and in doing so, embodies a childlike inquisitiveness and charms its audience into caring about mirrors and stones and 'silly incantations.' That is its pivotal achievement; that it can take the viewer back to a moment before they knew what a tax return was, or that Voldermort would rise again. Right from the moment Richard Griffiths practically sneers 'No post on Sundays,' you know the film will make an admirable attempt at recreating the magic of the books, but try as it might, it eventually falls short of the standard required to do justice to a novel, which whilst it may not be expertly crafted, had enough about it to capture the hearts of a generation. At eleven Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was one of the most awe inspiring things I'd seen, but several years on, it leaves something to be desired.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Dismal, Contrived, Ripoff and just plain dumb!","terribly contrived and juvenile.  From the outset, it treats viewers like they were little children - the problem is, that most children won't realize how terrible it is because they haven't the breadth of experience to notice how contrived and unoriginal the plot is.I don't blame Columbus though, JK Rowling has created a cliched story full of unoriginality and character shallowness.  The fact that Harry Potter seems to be everybody's favourite and is virtually invincible in the film just makes you feel sick at how predictable this film is.And the ending - my gosh, what a terrible ending.  Star Wars was bad enough with their super proton topedoes that destroy whole mother ships (and stupid Darth Vader never learnt the lesson of having such weaknesses from his experience in The Phantom Menace).

Quick Potter 1-7: Part 1,"Like it or leave it, J.K. Rowling created a hugely successful world, realised through her vivid imagination and highly accessible writing style. Derived from these was a trifecta of blockbuster potential and surely enough, we are five, nearly six, films through her saga. The box office figures have been inevitable given the legion of devoted fans and the obligation of the studios to provide at least worthy on-screen fare. Potter was not a thing to be squandered.Philosopher's Stone is a reasonable movie. Under Columbus' guidance the world is ably recreated visually, and he delivers you through it competently and with adequate faith to the novel. The now iconic score has well served its purpose, being both catchy and synonymous to the Potter franchise.The adult performances are widely superb, although as many terms like admirable or gutsy you would care to submit, the child performances, protagonists included, are.. child performances. Selected heavily on appearance, the young, inexperienced cast are thrown into the deep end and frequently stumble. But there are six more films for them to grow as actors.All in all, it suffers from a lack of ambition, perhaps a symptom of Rowling having provided a great deal of the vision already. At face value the film is sufficiently entertaining but little of it exceeds expectations when compared to the imagination of the reader. This disappoints given the opportunity for a true epic in nature, not just in run-time. The first instalment also begins the tradition of blisteringly, painfully cheesy endings. To the point of physical discomfort. 6/10",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A movie adaption that is really close to the book,"I was very impressed by Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I had read the book a year prior to the film release and was very impressed by how close the film was to the book, only skipping a few things for time. The things the movie skipped on wasn't enough to make the film unworthy to watch.If you haven't seen the film yet, but have read the book, I highly recommend this film. The acting is brilliant, the direction is great and the scenes are so close to what you will remember in the book. Director Chris Columbus really impressed me with this film.I give it a 10/10.Love Always & Blessed Be, Xander Trotter",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
But is it as good as the book?,"Of course like all paper to celluloid projects this movie was inevitably going to pose the question ""but is it as good as the book?"" but with JK Rowling firmly in control and overseeing the film production it was to be expected that she would push for authenticity in any case. It is still likely, however, that many die-hard Harry in print fans who have their own image of how it should have been will still say ""not near as good as the book"". But that is possibly more so a reflection on the delights of reading and how the imagination can conjure up an image in ones mind as opposed to being a criticism of the film.Inevitably of course elements of the book had to be sacrificed for brevity to make a movie that could retain the attention span of children - and even still it comes in at a considerable 2 hrs and 32 minutes. It still does manage to convey the core parts of the book admirably though and indeed it is said that, such were they complexities of aspects of the plot and location, it would have been very difficult to do just credit to the book without the advances in digital editing of the past five years. In that context Harry's School of Wizardry, Hogwarts, is portrayed exactly how you imagine it should be and even the Wizarding Game of Quidditch, which is basically like an airborne cross between seven a side soccer and basketball played on broomsticks with four balls, is portrayed quite well, though this is possibly one area where an over-dependence on special effects and high action (excuse the pun!) didn't exactly equate with what I had conjured up in my own head from the book. The casting is also rather inspired. Daniel Radcliffe quite simply IS Harry Potter. Richard Harris, as Headmaster Dumbledore, sports a beard even wilder looking than as the Bull McCabe if that is possible. Robbie Coltrane is excellent as the unkempt giant caretaker of Hogwarts; Hagrid and it seemed almost inevitable than no one but Alan Rickman at his super evil best could play Professor Snape, Harry's nemeses at Hogwarts.And so for those rareities who have never heard of Harry Potter  What of the plot? Basically young Harry Potter is something of a prodigious celebrity amongst Wizarding folk for surviving an attack from ""You know who"", otherwise known as, but seldom called the arch evil dark Wizard, Lord Maldevort, who killed both his parents when he was only one year old. Afterwards Harry is doomed to live with his very nasty muggle (Wizarding Folk Terminology for non wizards) aunt and uncle and cousin for the following ten years, knowing nothing about his wizardry, until he is finally rescued by Hagrid on his eleventh birthday and brought to Hogwarts school of Wizardry to begin to learn his trade. The film thereafter basically follows the adventures of Harry and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermoine Granger during their first year in Hogwarts.And so to the verdict? I found it a highly entertaining and quite inspired adaptation of the book; admittedly with some flaws, but I'd still grant it 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Dwelling on dreams and fantasies has never been so tempting,"Recently I participated in a family event that I didn't find too entertaining. To kill time, I decided to look around the bookshelf and found ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" - the first book in the Harry Potter series. Remembering how I got into the series when I was a kid, I decided to start reading it again as I have little to no memory of the plot. Consequently, it has been at least 15 years since the world of Harry Potter has been a part of my life. It was a pleasant light read, bringing back a lot of memories, so of course I had to watch the movie as well.The thing about books and their adaptations is that one media will never be equal to the other - not only by the means the story is broadcasted upon the watcher but also by the story itself. Different driving forces control our gaze, so different elements are used to portray the story, leaving the book and its adaptation to be somewhat different in the plot. Keeping that in mind, the review of this movie will not include the narrative of it being different from the book in any way, shape, or form. As they are two different media, different creative minds worked to portray their works to the reader/watcher and it would be unjust to praise or criticize a creator for his success or failure to represent the original medium in the context of an adaptation. The adaptation is meant to provide us with a story that we love in a different medium and sometimes there will be changes but those changes are the product of the new medium, not the product of adapting the story to a new medium. So, without any more delay, let's get to talking about ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"", the movie.The movie is an honest introduction to the fantasy world of magic. Harry Potter, a boy who is destined to be a great magician, doesn't know anything about the world of magic as his aunt and uncle tried everything in their power to keep that life away from Harry, so his journey starts with no knowledge about magic whatsoever. For us, the viewer, this is an advantage since we get to learn along as this new world slowly opens up upon Harry and takes us on a journey to Hogwarts.In Hogwarts, we get to four student Houses - colleges or residences, that separate the students based on their personalities - Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff in this movie had little to no representation, only Gryffindor and Slytherin had any sort of impact: Gryffindor being the House where our main protagonists are assigned and Slytherin, in contrast, representing the soft antagonist role in the story. I say soft because the way they are portrayed makes it look like they're just a hindrance to the protagonists but they don't have enough weight to be the main villains. The rhetoric of the movie paints Gryffindor students as the good guys - they are portrayed as brave, courageous, and fighting for fair causes - and Slytherin students as bad/evil guys - they are portrayed as ""all bark, no bite"" kind when they are talking (especially looking at the Slytherin quidditch team members), they are made to sound like Bond villains and there's even a remark that most wizards that turned mad (evil) were once students at House Slytherin. It doesn't help that the headmaster of this house is Severus Snape, the guy who dresses in black and sounds like the Sith lord. The contrast between these two houses results in bad blood between these two houses and we only get to see the situation from one side, which is sometimes a pity because I'd like to think that all houses are great with great histories and would like to see something positive from Slytherin. But, of course, this is the story of Harry Potter so we only get to see the picture that's made of events that directly involve Harry.Although Slytherin provides us with the antagonist's presence, the main villain of the movie lies elsewhere. The story mainly revolves around introducing us to the world of magic, different spells, different activities wizards partake in, and just random quirks that separate the life of a wizard from the life of a muggle (human) but there's also a mystery plotline that results in a great display of courage in the ending phrase of the movie. There's tension, there are twists and then there's just kids having fun and finding something to smile about. The main charm of the movie is the innocence and the unexpected nature of magic, sometimes various creatures start roaming the halls of Hogwarts, causing a panic, sometimes the staircases are moving and shifting the direction of the pathways, sometimes it's just a simple spell-ending up in a small explosion out of nowhere. Magic is displayed as having limitless options and in order to explore those options you need to know about both real and fictional herbs, creatures, and phonetics.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"One of the most hyped films of the year, Rowlings creation has found fans of all ages, though I must say Im not a diehard fan. And while I have to say I mildly enjoyed it, the film has done nothi","So far, the film has been well received by its young fans and most critics. Some critics and myself are less enthusiastic. Indeed, a friend of mine who has read the book was quick to point out that it was made simpler and more childish. If only director Chris Columbus and screenwriter Steve Kloves had done their jobs as well as the set designers, cast and visual effects people, this would have been the film of the year. As it stands, it is reduced to a moderately entertaining diversion which probably doesnt even warrant cinematic viewing. And to think it began so well, showing strong signs of plot development. Sadly, it starts to go downhill not long after Harry arrives at Hogwarts.I do not blame the actors. To be honest, they cant really do too much with their characters, for the screenplay never allows us to feel enough sympathy for them. Daniel Radcliffe is a credible Harry, while Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermione) show plenty of promise. However, Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) is the best performer in the film. John Cleese has a (very funny) small supporting part. Alan Rickman is also pretty convincing, though Ive seen better from him. Richard Harris is fine, and there are also appearances from more famous supporting players such as Maggie Smith and Julie Walters.The film is not without its great moments. The Quidditch game is NOT one of them though. The scene with the magic mirror, however, does standout. But the moment the story surrounding the stone begins, things begin to slide. Its not that the storyline isnt detailed, its just not exciting enough. There are surprises, but there seem to be less of those than predictable resolutions. To add insult to injury, the musical score is just as bland as some of the films characters.Visually, the film succeeds. Columbus has recreated Harry Potters world in a very appealing way, and many of the best scenes feature the use of visual effects. When the plot doesnt hold your interest, the effects and scenery do.For all this films flaws, it still has the capacity to entertain many, notably its child fans. Despite that, I still hope the probable sequel is much better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

"Not Perfect, but Magical","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is not a perfect film, but it is a magical film. The franchise has been a large part of my life for most of my life. With the first book coming out when I was three years old and the first movie when I was seven, there is a special place in my heart for the Wizarding World of Harry Potter.I know that it is not the most remarkable piece of art when looking at it from a filmmaking perspective. However, let us remember that this movie was made for children. When it comes to world-building and enveloping the audience, I would argue that this movie goes toe to toe with Lord of the Rings and some of the other greats.What Chris Columbus and company did is nothing short of game-changing. They took excellent source material, stayed true to the book and built upon it. The visuals, specifically involving Hogwarts, are gorgeous. The score by John Williams is one of the most recognizable of all time. The characters are instantly likeable (or despicable). There is honestly so much to praise and love about this movie.While not every scene is necessary to the plot, those ""pointless"" scenes further add to the feeling of magic. From sitting in Flitwick's classroom to ruminating on a windowsill with an owl, I could watch footage of Hogwarts on repeat. This is a movie that I could turn on at any time and jump right into the story. Simply put, I instantly have a warm feeling which stays with me the whole way through.While the acting and dialogue have some rough moments, particularly with the younger actors, the casting is excellent. From Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane to Richard Harris and Maggie Smith, there is not a single dud when it comes to the adult cast. The students are also perfectly cast, with the main trio's chemistry on full display.At the end of the day I'll say it again, I know that this is not a perfect film, but it is a magical film. The movie is highly rewatchable, endlessly quotable and enchantingly enjoyable. When defining ""comfort film"", this movie is at the top of the list. Simply put, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone set the stage for one of the most popular movie franchises of all time and one of the most impactful parts of my childhood.Best Character: Rubeus HagridBest Moment: Arriving to Hogwarts on the boats.Best Quote: ""It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends."" - Albus DumbledoreAdditional Note: Having the house cup ripped from Slytherin is why I have issues with premature celebration.

There were lovely elements - particularly the backgrounds - pictures etc, but for me, there was none of the soul that the books have - and it was largely missing the sly humour. The books have an edge that the film was lacking, I found some of the actors were ""distant"" - reading the roles rather than acting them. The film also felt choppy - with no real sense of development, it seemed to just jump from one incident to the next.I was also disappointed by the marginalisation of many of the characters who are important in the book - particularly the rest of the Weasleys and Malfoy.

Not only that, he also finds out that he will be attending Hogwarts (Wizarding school for Wizards and Witches) and that his parents were murdered by the most evil of all wizards, Voldemort, who was mysteriously destroyed by Harry.On his journey to Hogwarts, Harry makes two friends in Ron Weasely (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) along with a rival in Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton). Harry quickly learns of life in the wizard world and finds himself to be quite the celebrity due to his Quidditch (A popular wizard sport played on brooms) skills and his encounter with Voldemort. The movie also stars Richard Harris as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, Maggie Smith as Professor Minerva McGonagall, and Alan Rickman as Professor Severus Snape.This is the first of seven beloved movies adapted from the books by J.K. Rowling. In general, the book is usually better than the movie, and this is no exception, although it is a wonderful adaptation. The acting of the kids was made the movie incredibly entertaining and the effects were done brilliantly. This comes as no surprise, due to the massive book sales that created such a large budget for the film. But one of the greatest things about this movie is that they didn't go for star actors. Yes, you do have Richard Harris and Alan Rickman but they very well-known. Even the biggest star in the movie John Cleese played the very minor role of Nearly Headless Nick. This was a great opportunity to make another great saga of film and they made a wonderful start by not using big names. Overall, this is a great beginning to what hopes to be incredible chronicles and is a wonderful adaptation of the book.I recommend this film",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Utter Mince!,"So, £85 million well spent? I guess since they've already made more than double that back, then from a financial point of view - Yes! But as a film....Frankly I would rather remove one of my own limbs with a blunt hacksaw, then eat it raw before I watched this again. 2.5 hours of some of the most boring drivel, bad acting, weak special effects and irritating children you could hope to come across. The sooner these ""Child Stars"" descend into a drug and sodomy filled adolescence the better for all concerned.Yes I have read the books, and yes, I enjoyed them, but this is still one of the dullest films I've ever encountered. Sticking to the original story is one thing, but when the audience are left praying for the last 5 chapters to be cut, something's gone wrong.Back to my original point - where did the £85 million go? The Quidditch match was about on a par with King Kong for realism, and using Fungus the Bogeyman for the Troll was a masterpiece of imagination-free modelling. Perhaps all the money went on getting the magic tricks to look right? Or maybe not. How much effort does it take to have some brat wave his wand, the camera cuts away, comedy explosion sound effect, then camera cuts back to child with spiky hair and blackened face? Pure genius! They really have pushed back the boundaries of comedy here.All in all I feel cheated out of 2.5 hours of my life, and I strongly recommend that you don't fall into the same trap. If you have 2.5 hours that you really want rid of, then I'd suggest spending it slowly rubbing sandpaper over your eyeballs - it's cheaper, and more pleasant on the senses.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

"An excellent, serious family film: see it","a film is not a book and shouldn't be judged on the basis of its source material. having said that, most people seeing the film will judge it against the book and there will be few complaints. The only major omission is Peeves, which shows the route the makers have taken. The film takes a strong narrative and deals soberly with the issues, never going for cheap or sentimental laughs, and is all the better for it.The child actors are excellent: Daniel Radcliffe shows Harry's strength and intelligence very well: its not an easy part and he does really well. The real star is Robbie Coltrane, a superb Hagrid.For once the special effects do not overwhelm a family film but special mention must go to the Quidditch match, which is superbly well done and brilliantly imagined.Go, 9/10",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
sorcerers stone,"Sorcerers stone is the movie that started all and where all magic and its world begun on which a lot of children grow up including me,sorcerers stone is a good stepining stone for a massive franchise,still it has some problems with tone shifting and balancing fun and serious moments and it intruduced some charcters that in other movies never appeared again by that i think they were unneceserey to be even in first one,but for first film it intruduced this world in good way and intuduced a lot beloved now even iconic characters",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Breathtaking Effects and Excellent Characters,"The Sorcerer's Stone was an excellent introduction to the Harry Potter series. The main focus for this film was the development of the characters. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter could not have been better casted; he not only did a phenomenal job but also made the character come to life. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, who played Ron and Hermione were also wonderful throughout the whole film. The other characters such as Dumbledore, Hagrid, and McGonagall may play smaller parts however they are no less impressive. Along with the characters, this film also introduces Hogwarts, which was an unbelievable creation. The journey for the three children into Hogwarts and into each other's lives was very well done.I feel an element which adds a lot of character to the film is its use of lighting. The scenes inside of Hogwarts are lit by candlelight, torches, and oil lamps which gives them a very old world ambiance. Although the scenes were darker, this use of lighting allows the audience a truer look into how Hogwarts would have been.Once everyone is properly introduced to the audience, the plot shifts from character development to the story of Harry's, Hermione's, and Ron's search for the Sorcerer's Stone. As the children explore Hogwarts and search for the truth it is important to see how the characters react to conflict and how it continually builds the storyline. This is also important due to the fact that it is the first movie in the series and is setting the groundwork for those that follow.The next movie in the series Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, followed in the footsteps of its predecessor. It continues to develop the characters and helps to form an even deeper emotional attachment between them and the audience. The theme continues not only throughout the first film but all of those that follow. This made these films almost an addiction to the viewers, everyone who watches has a genuine concern for all of the characters and a curiosity about what will happen next.The unifying central concerns for this film were both characters and plot; both of these were equally important for the film as a whole. Together they created one of the most acclaimed family films of our time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Overated but still great,"I think people will always give it a 10 just for the nostalgia or if they liked the books. It's definitely not that good but still very enjoyable.

Three brave wizards go on an amazing adventure to take back the Philosopher's Stone,"I think this movie is very attractive to me. The Harry Potter film series is the world's highest grossing film series with over $ 7.7 billion in multi-national release. British writer J · K · Rowling's fantasy literature series novel describes the protagonist Harry Potter's 7 years of study at Hogwarts life adventure story, directed by Chris Columbus. Harry is the hero of the story. He is an adventurous child, I have to search for information about Harry display state among the living, so in real life Harry is a very brave and very clever boy. The film's score is also superb, seven out of ten, but the real wizards are JK Rowling, Chris Columbus, Steve Kloves and every member of this wonderful cast and crew bring it to life.

great adaption.,"I first saw the movie when it came out on DVD, my family had bought it for my younger sister. i had read the book it least 2 years previous (but i was never big on reading so its the only one i read at the time) i found the book interesting and then i watched the film.This movie is by far the best adaption to a book (most accurate) i have ever seen, it literally is magic. there's no denying that one.Pro's for me: the actors all did a wonderful job, especially the trio with it being there first time being in a real movie and being the stars of it on top of that, i thought they did fantastic. the effects throughout the who movie were done good. it is an amazing story and a good introduction also to the rest of the great series.Con's for me: at times, i felt that it moved to slow, but i didn't let that ruin it for me because it went at the same pacing as the book.its a great adaption from the book and a wonderful movie also.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Great film for kids (and all the family),"I am getting annoyed with all the extreme reviews
Too many 10/10s and definitely too many 1/10s.
This is a lovely film which all children love. Some of the child actors aren't very good, but they improved as the series of films progressed. The adult actors are terrific. The creme of British actors, perfectly cast and having a great time.
The locations and music are very good and the film is well paced.I just wish people would give films a score they deserve and not rank it extremely high or low to change the IMDB average to suit.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A brave attempt,"Given that they set out to make a film of the book, this is about as good as it could be. The cast are well-chosen, the scenery and effects eminently appropriate.However, the unfortunate effect is merely to demonstrate that Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone works much better as a book. Like all good adventures, Harry Potter has a whole lot of plot. There simply isn't time to fit the plot into the film comfortably without sacrificing other things. The relationships between the characters are thinly drawn, and the atmosphere of the school doesn't really come through.There's nothing overtly wrong with the film, and Harry Potter fans shouldn't be too disappointed, but, as so often, it's a much better book than it is a film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
It's bland like drinking warm water,"Warning: there may be spoilers ahead. Not like it matters, because the whole movie is rotten anyway, and you're better off not seeing it.I really don't get what kids like so much about this drivel. The main problem is that the characters are not likable. Not that they are dislikeable, they are just flat and bland like altar bread. And they don't change at all from the beginning to the end. Who's to blame - the bad actors, the mediocre director, or the awful writer? Really, I've seen far better character development in ""Revenge of the Nerds"".And the story is just dumb. It starts with a good point: a kid with magical powers. Where did I hear that before? Oh, of course: ""The Books of Magic"". Except for the fact that JK Rowling is no Neil Gaiman... but anyway, here's an example. When Potter's magic powers first appear, he never seems to be too puzzled by them, never gets scared, nor thinks about using them to exact revenge from his cruel family. Hello? Anyone there ever read ""X-Men""? If you suddenly get super-human powers, you must be puzzled and tempted!Talking about cruel families... they can be excellent plot devices. Green Goblin, anyone? But Potter seems to be immune to a decade of humiliation. Sure, he is quite lethargic (or is it bad acting?), but is never aggressive or rancorous. Which makes no sense.There are lots of other bad scenes, like the ridiculous chess scene. Remember that scene of ""Attack of the Clones"" that was sometimes mockingly described as 'Star Wars meets Megaman'? This is similar, but even worse. There's no sensible reason for this place to exist, yet it does. Even if the rest of the movie was not a disgrace, that scene alone would have ruined it. Any suspension of disbelief that had survived the previous awfulness of the movie was killed at that exact moment.Bad acting, bad directing, bad visual effects, bad music, and - above anything else- the bad writing... with all these problems, this movie ends up bland like drinking warm water. It has absolutely no flavor - but it can still make you want to throw up.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Magic Begins.,"With every major franchise, trilogy, etc. everything must start somewhere, and to most people the first two installments in the Harry Potter franchise always seem to have negative reviews. I don't blame them, some things feel a little out of order and some things are dated but nevertheless Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone makes for a true fun and entertaining film unlike most.I, in simple terms, can describe my feelings toward the entire franchise as love. Director Chris Columbus turned an already stellar book series, by the ever so wonderful J.K. Rowling, into a monumental experience that resonates with audiences off all kind. He films with such an enthusiastic way and wants to open everyone to this wonderful world of wizards. In two and a half hours Columbus sets up the way for many sequels to come and fits all the exposition in ever so slightly, that doesn't feel shoved in or too much to handle.Over my years I've seen some pitch-perfect casting choices and with this it results in sheer brilliance as I watch Daniel Radclifee, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson be their characters. They're in no way ""great"" but they have their charisma and play off each other great. Alan Rickman, Richard Harris, and Maggie Smith are a different story, they excell in their characters and show their ability as actors. Each and every actor portraying anyone is so beautifully perfect, I could never see anyone else playing them. Using his 30 year career to his advantage, composer John Williams makes a rich and true score that any person, fan or not, can reconcile with.It may not LOOK as magical as it once did but the magic is still there in a film adaptation so close to the original it's uncanny. Sure compared to the time of release and to its sequels Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone may seem outdated and not up to par, but it still results in an excellent story crafted by Chris Columbus, that introduced the world to Harry Potter for years to come.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Journey into the World of Magic: the Beginning of a great Saga,"I remember watching this movie when I was still a teenager. It's not a bad story, but no more. And recently I watched the entire series of films, rethought and truly enjoyed this deeply researched story.""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" reveals the magical world created by J. K. Rowling. The story tells about a young boy, Harry, who suddenly finds out that he is not an ordinary orphan, but a real wizard. Once at the Hogwarts School of Magic, Harry meets new friends, immerses himself in exciting lessons and faces the first dangers. This is a fabulous adventure with elements of mystery, magic and friendship, which captures the viewer from the very first minutes.Director Chris Columbus, whom I know well from his work on the ""Home Alone"" dilogy, ""Gremlins"", ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" and other projects, was a great fit to work on this picture. His special style is ready to show the story with enthusiasm and interest. Especially for a children's audience.The casting specialists have perfectly matched the actors, making the film literally come to life. Daniel Radcliffe, embodying Harry Potter, perfectly conveys the naivety and surprise of a boy who plunges into the magical world for the first time. Emma Watson as Hermione charms with intelligence and perseverance, and Rupert Grint as Ron adds sincere humor. The three of them set the tone for the whole film, creating the basis for the emotional connection of the young audience with the characters.Among the adult actors, it is worth noting Richard Harris in the role of the wise and kind Dumbledore, as well as Robbie Coltrane, whose Hagrid became the real embodiment of warmth and care. Allan Rickman, who plays the mysterious Professor Snape, is intriguing with his mystery and deep character. All the others are good too. In their own way, each of the actors saturates the characters they play with life.The film reveals the theme of friendship, bravery and dedication. He shows how important it is to find allies and rely on friends in difficult times. Harry's story teaches that even in the most difficult situations, kindness, self-belief and the desire to find the difficult truth will help to find answers to the questions posed.The film was nominated for many prestigious awards, including three Oscar nominations (for best Scenery, costumes and music by John Williams). The film won the Saturn Award in the Best Costumes category, which is not surprising, given the magnificent visual representation of the world of magic. Rupert Greene also took the award. It was a special Golden Satellite award for a talented debut.""The Philosopher's Stone"" develops the plot with dignity, every moment seems organic and fascinating. Harry's introduction to Hogwarts, scenes in magic lessons, exciting Quidditch matches - each of these scenes expands the fantasy world and increases the desire to find out what will happen next. The film skillfully combines humor and frankly difficult moments for the characters, and its finale not only completes the current story, but also hints at further exciting events.The painting perfectly copes with the task of introducing the viewer to the rich universe of magic and miracles. ""The Philosopher's Stone"" became the beginning, I'm not afraid of this word, of a cult saga, setting the tone for the entire franchise. Although it lacks the scale of the subsequent installments, the charm and warmth of this film make it memorable.""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" is a magical journey that takes the viewer into a world full of wonders and mysteries. I liked the movie, it pleases with the atmosphere and the fascinating plot.7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Good Movie For Fans Of Potter,"Harry Potter's first big screen debut was one of the most waited-for movies besides Episode I. Now that it has come and gone I can safely say that it IS a good movie, not great, but still good. Acting was fair. Being true to Rowling's awesome book was pretty good also. But some people that have never read the book(s) might have a hard time following the movies choppy flow, which is okay at times, but at others it skips parts that should have stayed to help further explain the story, but other than that the movie is very well executed. I mean, how in the world are you going to fit this huge, classic book into a movie? You do have to leave out some of it, or else the movie would be five hours long!

You can tell it was perfectly measured to be a nibble at the onset of larger events to come but also pieced a full movie.That being said, perhaps it was a little too central to the main personality and lacked diversification of arcs, particularly since one is going to need all the help they can get, and such help is to be understood . Moreover if the course wasn't to be as so, what could have provoked more meaning is a larger crescendo.Nevertheless, sorcerer's stone fit the bill and revealed what is to be expected apropos.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Even though this is great for fans, I find it detracts from the story some and makes certain parts of the film lag in pace.Overall a well put together movie.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Commerce,"Ouch. This film irritated me so much I was in tortuous pain by the end of it. I only really have one reason for despising this film, but this reason is so monumental in its power that it caused me to spend much of the film writhing around on the carpet in agonising spasms, spasms from which I am only just beginning to recover. The reason ladies and gentlemen, is terrible child acting.The three kids, in particular the girl, are guilty of some of the most trite, sickly sweet overacting ever seen on the silver screen. They reminded me of primary school plays where the most precocious kids in the class are given the leading roles rather than those with any semblance of charisma or acting ability. They somehow fail in portraying any tangible or believable emotion whatsoever. They do however succeed in over-pronouncing every single letter of every syllable of every word as if the Lord of Language himself (possibly Stephen Fry) were watching over them ready to strike them down in the event of a missing 't' in sweet or a missing 'g' in bloody annoying. It is the cinematic equivalent of Maria Carey warbling up and down through every conceivable note in order to try and prove that she can sing; but in doing so exhibiting a pretentiousness that has no place on this earth.My unofficial award for worst acting performance is currently held by the actor who played young Anakin Skywalker in The Phantom Menace, but these three run him very close indeed.Someday I will get around to reviewing the film's plot and characters but only when the agony and nausea are fully extinguished from my limbs and I can once again look out upon the world with the asceticism and joyful exuberance that have become my trademark.

I love the sets, the wardrobe, and acting. Even the music was good!Kid safe and entertaining enough for adults.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Brilliant... in parts... but sloooooooow,"First let me set the scene. I went to see this film with my near seven-year-old. I hadn't read the book first, though subsequently I have, if only to confirm my thoughts.Well, firstly there's no doubt that Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone will be the highest-grossing fim of all time, so if that's all that Warner Bros intended, then they've done a fabulous job. It'll win a hatful of Oscars too, some of which it'll actually deserve. But for all of that, the film's got its own serious weaknesses - and I just don't see why almost to a man, every professional critic has waxed so lyrical about it... I guess that the hype juggernaut has a lot more momentum than I first expected.Let's deal with the movie's many good points first. The sets are both breath-taking and beautifully executed, the cinematography simply wonderful and the casting director needs a medal, so inspired was the choosing of the actors. Amongst the adults, Maggie Smith is just perfect as the Jean Brodie-esque Professor McGonagall, Robbie Coltrane an endearingly gruff Hagrid, and Alan Rickman as ever steals every scene as the venomous Professor Snape in worryingly threatening jet-black wig. Even Richard Harris, who is rather prone to going way over the top, makes a pleasant Headmaster Dumbledore. This is exactly the type of movie that British actors do so well, and much credit to J.K. Rowling for insisting on a British cast.But the child stars excel as well, and Chris Columbus shows a sure touch and empathy with his understanding direction of them. Daniel Radcliffe is the embodiment of Harry Potter, even if all he has to do is look suitably amazed most of the time. He is utterly outdone by the totally natural Rupert Grint as the down-to-earth Ron Weasley, and the equally superb take no nonsense Emma Watson as Hermione Granger - everyone knew kids just like these at school. They are completely believable as characters, and not once does their acting lapse into the cutesey or irritating. Much applause again here for there not being some precocious Hollywood bratlet in the cast. That would have entirely destroyed the chemistry.So after all this praise, what are the problems? It's simple... pace. It's been widely reported that the original director's cut was over 4 hours long, but even at 153 minutes, this film drags. I was clock-watching from half an hour in. There seems to have been a desire to methodically film every last page and scene in the novel - and so the movie is paced like a novel - slow and laborious. But hey, we're talking MOVIE here - it's not a novel. The eye gets to do most of the work in a movie and it's instant. That's why novels need to be ADAPTED when they're filmed, and not religiously and slavishly followed. Plus because this was the approach taken, the essential editing to cut this film down to bearable lengths then has left out chunks of important plot and motivational background. Just to pick two points at random... did anyone actually get the impression that we were watching a whole school year? Could anyone guess *why* Snape hated Harry? I guess we'll need to wait for the ""Director's Cut"" DVD.Don't get me wrong. The film has plenty to its credit. But its eventual released execution definitively has major pacing issues... it drags. Everyone seems to have got very over-excited about the whole Harry Potter phenomenon as something massively innovative and brand-new. It's not. It's all been done many times before, just not in the last 40 years or so, and so people have forgotten typical English children's literature from that period dealing with ""public school"" and ""jolly good chums"" and ""riproaring adventure"". But maybe it was time for its revival. Next time, please... make it pacier.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A Harry Potter Virgin Speaks,"By January 2013 I had never read a Harry Potter book or seen any of the movies. I decided to start with the movies.I've always avoided Harry Potter as what little I had heard about the books and movies did not appeal to me. The one thing that I had seen was a sequence from this first film of the Quidditch game and this was enough to put me off for all the intervening years. There are plenty of interesting theories on the origin of witches and broomsticks but kids using broomsticks to play a ball game is not one of them. This sequence was still the one I really, really disliked in the film and I groaned every time Quidditch sequences appeared in subsequent films.Two things surprised me about this film (and was borne out by the subsequent ones). Firstly they aren't about magic and witchcraft at all. In fact the nearest anyone ever gets to magic is waving a wand a speaking a couple of cod Latin words. Secondly they are primarily about life in a boarding school and perhaps should have been called ""Harry of the Second Remove and his Magic Wand"" or perhaps ""Hermione of the Sixth and her  "" (On second thoughts let's not go there).None of these comments mean that I did not like the film nor that I thought it was bad. On the contrary, once I got past my preconceptions, I thoroughly enjoyed this excellent family film. It worked brilliantly on the level of Harry's ill treatment at the hands of his adoptive parents, his integration into the school and the beginning of the introduction of the external threats to his world. It was well directed, funny and always engaging.The young cast did well although they clearly had a long way to go. Daniel Radcliffe sometimes looked as though he had been well tutored in the art of pulling particular faces to express different emotions though his eyes didn't always show he had internalised them. Rupert Grint was probably the best of the young actors. The adult actors were uniformly good and the decision to work only with British thesps was clearly the right one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Pure magic and true to the spirit of the books,"One of the most anticipated and one of the best films of 2001.Yes there are sections from the book that have been missed out ( like the magical world's jubilation at the demise of Voldemort, a lot of the pre-letter scenes with the Dursleys, all of Dudley's ""friends"", the first meeting with Malfoy, the school song etc. ) BUT it doesn't matter.The look is right, it feels right and it is marvellously executed from the cast, locations, direction and CGI/animation ( Compare and contrast the excellent Fluffy and the Centaur with that dire Scorpion in Mummy Returns ! )This is a magic film with its own powerful magic - that of creating a world where you can stay for an all too short a time.Certainly my film of the year.

Wonderful! A great film for all ages!,"Having never read any of the books, I did not know what to expect when I went to view this film. All I knew about it was what I read in the newspapers, and saw on the news. This movie is magnificent, and will surely become a classic!! The story, special effects, and even the unknown actors, all do a wonderful job in this great film.Harry is an orphaned boy of a witch and wizard, who is sent to live with his aunt and uncle. However, at his eleventh (sorry if I'm wrong about his age) birthday, he gets summoned to become a wizard at a wizard's school. This is where all the fun begins.Unlike many of the other reviewers here, as stated above, I have never read the book, so I cannot compare the two. However, I was entertained for the two and a half hours that the movie lasted.

The way the film is set out is amazing. The style on Hogwarts and the CGI brings the book to life. All the characters are acted out perfectly and are just like they should be. I certify this film: GOOD.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Slightly disappointing,"I've read books.  Enjoyed most of them (they became a bit samey at times, and the basic structure was repeated far too often for my liking).Unfortunately the film was a little disappointing, the acting very stale and transparent at times.  The visual effects were also uninspiring.The film portrayed the important sections of the book reasonably well, but the pacing was off at times, and I found my mind wandering at times.It could have been so much better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A Great Beginning...........,This was such a brilliantly done film. Well Harry Potter is a brilliantly done franchise in general. But the Sorcerers Stone (or Philosophers Stone) is a well done beginning for this franchise. The character development in this franchise is absolutely fantastic. You get instantly attached to the main and side characters instantly. All the actors did a great job and gave funny and fun performances. The overall feel of this movie is so magical and has such a fun feel. I have never seen a movie World get you so attached more quickly then Harry Potter. Overall this film was awesome and I highly recommend it.,8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

"This first film in the franchise is a true family film, but never too childish and with scary parts as well.","In the first film, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Harry thinks he is""just Harry"". But actually he's a wizard who lives with his hostile uncle, aunt and cousin somewhere just outside London. On one special day he gets a letter, but his mean uncle Vernon Dursley prevents Harry from opening the letter, which results in an invasion of letters to Harry from Hogwarts, school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The friendly half-giant Hagrid saves Harry on his eleventh birthday and brings him to the place where he can buy all the things he needs. After finding a wand and a pet, he goes to the station - platform 9 3/4 to be precise - and hops on the train to Hogwarts. This is where he meets his future best friends: Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. At Hogwarts he meets all the rest of the school, including the teachers and headmaster Dumbledore. He learns all new stuff, find friends but also learns about his past and parents. This first year is also the first time he encounters the most evil wizard of all time: Lord Voldemort, or at least a part of him.The film where it all started came out in 2001 and shows a very young cast. It's hard not to love all these young actors. The book however, written by J.K. Rowling, was published in 1997. Therefore it already had some kind of fanbase and it was only getting bigger once the film came out. Out of thousands of British children, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were cast as the main character, respectively Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Harry is 'the boy who lives' and the only person on earth who ever survived a death curse. In contrast to Ron, who comes from a true wizard family, he knows nothing of magic, but his parents were amazing wizards. Hermione on the other hand doesn't have magical parents, but she is very bright and a bit of a know-it-all. Ron and Harry find her quite annoying, but after some crazy event - which includes a troll - they are besties for life! A student from a rival group at school, is Draco Malvoy. Tom Felton plays this white haired bully, who has an evil father, very well!The other main characters are the school's headmaster Albus Dumbledore, who is played by Richard Harris. Fun fact is, he declined the role at first but a relative of his demanded Harris to play the part. Maggie Smith plays Professor Minerva McGonagall, the friendly half-giant - who has a love for the most disturbing creatures - is played by Robbie Coltrane. One of my favourite characters, Professor Severus Snape, is played by Alan Rickman. His voice and his total appearance is so brilliant, and Snape is also a mysterious character. Nobody knows what he's up to and who he truly is. This year's villain is the stuttering Professor Quirinus Quirrell, who is played by Ian Hart. He is the first one who tries to let Voldemort return. The most amazing thing is that a lot of characters come back every now and then, in every film. Like the family of Harry and Ron, the students, who are all truly a part of this franchise. There might be something else which comes back, sort of. When Harry gets his invisibility cloak, the card says: ""Use it well"". This is the same phrase Professor Horace Slughorn in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Anyone noticed that?? I thought it was brilliant!The first film is because of the age of the main characters, not that scary. It's all about getting to know the school, the students, teachers and of course magic. However, we also learn a bit about Harry's past and the evil wizard who killed his parents. There are parts - towards the end and the scene in the woods - which would scare me, if I was a child. At least Ron Weasley is scared at those moments, which is sometimes quite funny. Ron also makes comments which makes you laugh, even as an adult. The part where we found out the truth about professor Quirrel, is kind of a plot twist. I can't remember exactly how I thought about that when I saw the film for the first time, but I think it can be a surprise. The soundtrack, composed by John Williams, is one you'll never forget. It's truly brilliant and we should thank Williams for being a part of the film! Actually the whole film looks amazing. Besides the soundtrack, the complete decor, effects and make-up are magnificent. The goblins in the bank for example are very well made. Just think about it that the film is over 10 years old! How would it look when the film was made today. with the latest technique? I can not think it could be any better!In the first film in the franchise the characters are just starting their new school and learn new things. Because this is the first film, the characters are very young. It's only logic this is more a family film than the latter ones. However it's never too childish and there are in fact some scary parts, but it never gets too dark. The character traits of many already evident: we see who's good and who's bad. The friendship between Harry, Ron and Hermione is very credible, they are a good fit! It's amazing how this film is the start of en entire franchise, which lasted a decade! Next film in the franchise is Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the weaker Potter films,"Though I enjoy the novels, the Harry Potter film adaptations have always been hit and miss affairs for me. Outside of about two of them, most of the entries in the movie franchise are either charmless and bland or stylish but incomprehensible to people who have not read the books. Sorcerer's Stone is in the former category.Chris Columbus' ""whimsical"" direction is lifeless. The overly lit visuals are boring and the whole thing just feels like an exposition dump. The child actors give stiff performances (not coming into their own until about the third installment). The adults are a touch better but cannot do much with the awkward book to screen treatment. The only excellent aspect of the film is John Williams' score, which evokes the wonder, mystery, and warmth of the original book more than the actual movie does.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
My Second Review,"I reviewed this film about a year ago when I had seen it for the first time and I said that I liked the book more but the more I see this film I have discovered that I like the movie just as much as the book.  I think that Harry Potter is such a great book and movie series.  I personally love the fact that they started making the movies because now along with my visualizations that I have, I also have the visualizations that go along with the movie.  I can't wait until Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban(my favorite out of all the books) comes out, I believe that it will be the coolest book to see on the big screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
I don´t like the books but this is pretty good!!!,"THE BOOKS: I don´t like them at all.WHY??? Because of they are all the same.I have read four Potter books and I liked the first one but the rest are just almost exactly as the first one.Another thing is that the kids in the books are stereotypes.I mean when I was a kid I was WILD but in Harry Potter all of the kids are little angels(but of course not the ones that are evil,and I do mean evil).THE FILM: It´s a good adaption from the film even if it is a bit to long(But I don´t think that it could have been shorter).It has magnificent special effects and the acting is also good.John Cleese is in the film for about 10 seconds and says two lines.WHY???????RATING:3+/5",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

A very entertaining and delightful film,"I haven't read the books yet, I wanted to see at least one of the films first. My opinion is based only on the film. The cast and crew did a beautiful job in creating a truly magical world. I tend to love movies that paint a picture on a grand scale, and this film truly did just that. The sets were remarkably done and the performances came across on genuine and believable. Regardless of any controversy surrounding the book or film, I would recommend it to anyone. It's a great fantasy/adventure.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the Most Magical Films of the Twenty-First Century,"I love this film. Yes, nostalgia has a lot to do with my love, but I don't care. This film came out when I was seven years old and I was in first grade. My mother and father took me to our local movie theater to see it. Harry Potter book mania was in full swing and the phenomenon with the wonderful film series was about to explode with joy. Re- watching the films in order now I can look back on this film with a certain point of view. The first three H.P. films feel like stand alone stories and for the most part set up about 70% of the saga. Now that's was ""Sorcerer's Stone is"" a wonderful world building movie that keeps getting built upon with each new film.The greatness of ""Sorcerer's Stone"" are that it get's everything right 100%. For an adaptation, it follows the book faithfully. Granted there are elements and chapters omitted, but that's the adaptation process. The cast of youthful and seasoned actors are wonderful. Everyone is cast perfectly and each movies the actors grow into their parts with ease and perfection. The Cinematography is colorful and dark, the musical score by the ingenious John Williams is beautiful and magical, the direction by Chris Columbus is sharp as well.Even though this film is not perfect, no movie really is anyway, I love it. Any criticisms I have with the film generally go with the whole series. Some films do go on too long.The pace in this particular film can drag on. The plot does have an Indiana Jones vibe where it is one even after the other. Some films in the series are plot driven like ""Chamber of Secrets"" and ""Goblet of Fire"" and some are character driven like ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" and ""Half-Blood Prince"". ""Sorcerer's Stone"" ""Order of the Phoenix"" and ""Deathly Hallows"" are a combination of both character development and plot development. There really is not much for me to nit-pick about this film. It's easy for people to complain about the special effects, but for the film that was establishing the series, the computer generated effects are fine. In my opinion, the whole film series have special effects that range from wonderful to mediocre. But that's just time catching up to the movies.Overall, this film is wonderful. It's a happy origin tale about the boy who lived and it's full of action, humor, danger, wonder, magic, and most importantly, heart. Fifteen years after its release, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is a golden fantasy-family film classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A fair first outing for the famous Boy Wizard,"'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' no doubt divided many fans of the 'Harry Potter' novels, of whom I am one. The film adaptation of a much loved book was never going to please everyone and, while it is an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours, there is no denying that it has both good and bad points.For those who have just flown in from Pluto, the hero of PS is young Harry Potter, a bi-spectacled British boy who has lived with his brutish relatives since he was orphaned at the age of fifteen months. However, on his eleventh birthday, Harry's life changes forever when he discovers his secret legacy...that he is a wizard. He sets off eager to start his First Year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, making friends with fellow First Years, know-all Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, the sixth son of an impoverished but kindly Pureblooded wizarding family. Yet life is not destined to be all fun and games for as our young hero quickly adapts to this wonderful new world, he learns the disturbing truth behind his parents' deaths and that sometimes evil doesn't die easily.The quality of the adult actors was just superb. Alan Rickman as Snape, Maggie Smith as McGonagall, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid and Julie Walters and Mark Williams as Molly and Arthur Weasley were all destined to play these roles, truly bringing the characters to life in a way I didn't think would be possible. I was less keen on Richard Harris' Dumbledore, feeling he was just a shade too cold and stand-offish to play an paternal man who the neglected Harry came to trust with ease. That said, the adult cast were definitely the backbone of the film, especially in light of the rather mediocre child cast.While Daniel Radcliffe may resemble the living embodiment of Harry Potter, it was evident from his lacklustre performance in PS that he was chosen purely on looks rather than talent. At the best of times, he portrayed Harry as a rather bland and uninspiring hero and, at his lower moments, he was just cringe-worthy (the scene where he discovers he is a wizard is particularly clunky). Devon Murray, who played Seamus, and James and Oliver Phelps, cast as the Weasley twins, were equally as wooden. However, there are a few gems in the group. Tom Felton was excellent in bringing the maliciously mischievousness of Draco Malfoy to life and he is, undoubtedly, the best of the bunch. Emma Watson's Hermione was suitably condescending and obnoxious as the character was aged eleven (sadly, come GoF, Emma didn't comprehend that Hermione had largely out-grown the conceitedness was an integral part of her character in PS). While Tom Felton was the best of the child cast overall, Rupert Grint, who played Ron, was the best of the trio, bringing to the character a quiet loyalty to his friend balanced with the boyish exuberance that was very much apparent to eleven-year-old Ron.The script might be a tad too childish for those over twelve, with not enough focus on the more interesting adult characters, but I believe it suited the mood of the novel given Harry was eleven in PS so viewed the wizarding world in the very innocent, awestruck manner of a child. Director Chris Columbus nicely compliments this by capturing a wondrous, Disney-like feel to Hogwarts in a way that leaves the audience joining Harry in his delight at exploring the magic of the wizarding world. The special effects are acceptable with the exception of the cartoony Quidditch match, which seems to have been lifted straight from the Nintendo video game and awkwardly pasted to the film, and the hideously computerised centaur.PS was a fair adaptation, enjoyable in itself although no-where near the epic of LotR. It does capture the innocence of the characters at a time when they believed the world was neatly divided into good and evil and magic could sort any problem, however, older fans will most likely find the faster, mature pace of the adaptations of the latter novels more suited to their tastes as, in comparison, PS seems to be directed mainly at little fans under twelve.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Visual Awe Vaults It Even Over Book,"If you watch ""Sorcerer's Stone"" without reading the book first, there are certain narrative points that you will miss or not quite be as clear on (as usual). However, watching the movie closely following the reading experience will actually expand upon the Potter myth (I gave the first book four stars) due to this film's ability to lay the groundwork of the series in such stunning visuals and characters.For a basic plot summary, ""Sorcerer's Stone"" sees young Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) living with his aunt and uncle and being mistreated horribly (sleeping in a closet under the stairs, told how rotten he is all the time, etc.). Right before his 11th birthday, however, Harry begins receiving letters from a mysterious owl (as well as a visit from a rather large gentleman riding a flying motorcycle) informing him that he is in fact from wizard lineage. Thus, Harry is whisked away to Hogwarts, a ""Wizard Academy"" of sorts, to begin his training. While at Hogwarts, Harry meets new friends Ron (Rupert Grint) & Hermoine (Emma Watson) as well as discovers the mystery behind the death of his parents regarding a shadowy character called Voldemort.In terms of following the novel, this film does a pretty good job of keeping in lock-step. There are certain scenes that are excised for time/continuity and a few ""facts"" from the book that are blatantly different from the movie, but other than that it is a great representation.In fact, in a departure from the norm, I actually enjoyed the movie experience better than the book. Why? Because of the way it was able to so wonderfully put a visual to all the great characters. For some, the ""mystery is gone"" when they see their literary characters up on the big screen, but in this case I was very pleased to put a face to all these great characters.The movie also has (just like the book) a sense of ""epic-ness"" to it. It is very clear that this is only the beginning of an epic series, with more and more mysteries and character development to come.Thus, ""Sorcerer's Stone"" is a great cinematic experience that will leave you wanting more as soon as it concludes. The mysteries and characters are paced perfectly, and the story (as it is geared for young adults in the first place) is easy enough to latch onto while nuanced enough to get sucked into.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
My childhood memories,"A classic is a classic. You can't get enough of it.

I can see why the kids like it.,My review of this film may be a little blinded by the fact that i hate kids films but that apart i can see why kids would like this film. The story is very good as are the special affects and there is a very good cast of actors. The shame is that the lead star is the poorest of all the actors including all the other child actors. It's ok to have the Harry Potter look but it does help have the acting abilty too and i'm afraid Daniel Radcliffe does not have it. Robbie Coltrane and Richard Harris are superb . I have not seen read the book (im one of the few!)so i have an unbiased point regarding the comparison but i can see how the book would have some appeal if it is anything like the film. All in all not bad but not my cup of tea. 7 out of 10.,7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Just enjoy it!,"You know what?  I'm getting sick of reading comments by people who are tearing this movie apart, saying it twists mythology, it is unimaginative, it is done simply for cold cash, etc..  Well, a lot of these people are the same ones who will go see the same action movie over and over again, despite the lack of plot and talent.  Hollywood just does not make good family movies anymore that are not animated, and I think that is very well done. The child actors are wonderful and have great timing for actors of their age.  Just enjoy it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
For fans only,Now the reason I make that statement is because you have to be a fan of Harry Potter to have enjoy this movie or you have to be a fan of wizard movies to better enjoy.I remember seeing this movie in theaters with family members that I didn't hang out with much and I remember how cold it was outside in the theater but when we went inside the movie theater room to watch the film it was really hot. So much so that I wanted the movie to be done as soon as possible because I remember being miserable in the hot room.Now onto the movie I never read any of the Harry Potter books nor have I even heard of this movie until I saw it in theaters.So the film does have a good cast of actors and they did perform very well in the movie. The plot from what I can tell follows the events of the book and the characters seem to have follow the same way as they are in the bookThere are some cool effects in the film that make you go wow but a few that only fans would understandMusic in the film matches the movie and it works to help telling the story.It just the film to me was a bit confusing and didn't make a fan out of me. It just some of the scenes in the movie leave me scratching my head so this film would only be more for the fans of Harry Porter while it does something for someone who enjoy this series of movies it just one of those love/hate ordealsI give Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone an 7 out of 10,7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Finllay re-watched it,"This film is by all means a classic, but classic does not mean great. Though the set design and camera work (not specifically cinematography but rather how the camera moved through scenes) and editing was great. That film as a whole does not deserve as much credit as it gets.The acting is awful and, I mean that in the biggest way possible. And the pacing throughout the movie also makes no sense. The introduction of the film feels forced and like a joke, but not in a funny way, and finally the cinematography is plain and average at best.What makes me give this 5 stars instead of 2 or 3 though, is the outstanding set design and beautiful scenes which where definitely not made great through cinematography.If you are going to watch the harry potter series, start from the prisoner of azkaban, as that is the first really good harry potter film.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

When I finally bought the DVD I was sorry I hadn't seen it at the theater as I found that the movie was a truly worthy adaptation of the book.Special effects were wonderful and the acting was outstanding, even by the youngsters in the cast.

AKA Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,"I'm finally in a position to re-watch and review the Harry Potter film series - I'm way past over due for reviewing them.First of all, I don't know of anyone that has not seen at least one Harry Potter flick. Everyone seems to agree that these are great films - I am no exception.Secondly, the entire series is highly entertaining! If you haven't seen this series then I highly recommend you should. Comical, magical and all around fun to watch.This first film starts out with a bang as when Hagrid, Dumbledore and Minerva McGonagall show up with baby Harry Potter on the doorstep of Harry's relatives home. The film ends on a good note with the house cup being awarded. In between the beginning and ending is non-stop entertainment.Great to watch this film again9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
too over-hyped; doesn't deliver,"I've read all the Harry Potter books and really liked them. This movie pales in comparison to the books.  Too much is left out of the movie, especially the ending.  The book shows how all 3 kids overcome the challenges by doing what they are good at. And the movie leaves some of that out.  The kids were awful actors.  They must have cast the cheapest kids they could find.Dumbledore was what I pictured from the book. I also liked the Gobulin Bank, the mirror, and the hidden alley.  It was pretty much like the book. The special effects were good, but that doesn't make up for the slow pace of the movie.  Time just flew by when reading the book.  The quiddick match wasn't that great in the movie either.FINAL VERDICT: If you don't want to be disappointed, then just read the books.  But if you must watch the movie, watch it on tape so you can stop it to take some breaks because you will need some to be able to stay awake during its slow moving pace.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Good Visuals, That's about it.","I liked aspects of this movie, but the movie as a whole does not stand up to the great movies. Sure the kids all love Harry Potter, but they also love Pokemon, and don't get me started on that. I guess all the hype came from the fact that this phenomenon extended to even the adult demographic. Parents started reading the books as well. So they all went to see this wonderful movie together, so I just had to go.To tell you the truth, it is a pretty good magical tale about a boy who is destined to be the ultimate of wizards. In my opinion, though, the movie seemed to hop along like a chocolate frog, it seemed disjointed to me. It's almost as if there are certain defined 'chapters' that have been plopped down right out of the book. It needed to flow a little better if you know what I mean. Other than that, it seemed to hit the mark.I just wasn't very interested in it at all. I've seen to many movies to be impressed anymore by special effects, it's got to have real character.

"Enchantment, Trapdoor to Imaginary World.","This is not a film, it is a trap door to a life, we all wanted to live in when we were kids. It's been years since I had watched the first chapter of JK Rowling wizarding world, I wanted to review with utmost passion and dedication but my thoughts, feelings never inked on the words.
Seems like, I was missing that feather pen to wrote it down.Harry Potter, changed the dimensions of my life. I escaped my reality countless times while watching this film. I was in 8th standard when I watched the cinematic world of Harry Potter.
Being a Small Town Pakistani Boy, It was really hard for me to live in the reality. Always wanted to be the part of the famous trio. As years commenced, I always wishes to have freinds like Harry, who were brave to stood up for their friends. A female friend like Hermione Granger, with her wit she can help to course with social and academic life but this was just a dream. There are millions around the globe who have viewed it.Chris Coloumbus magnificentlly crafted the Wizardly World of Harry Potter. I really loved his direction, the way he captured the metaphors of the first novel was aesthetic. Campus, classrooms, dormotories, dining room, Hogwarts, Quiditch, we feel to be stuck in there and When Hagrid waves to the trio in the End, that scene seems like a 3rd act to wave to the audience to go back in your reality, the world is waiting you.Emma Watson shines through her role of hermione granger. Her cleverness and wit make her character memorable. I liked her british accent, the words sounds symphonic and melodical.
Daniel Radcliffe was truly the Boy who lived. He was innocent yet brave. Robert Grint supported him well throughtout the film. Tom Felton did great in the limited version of Draco Malfoy, wanted to see him more when I was kid.
Richard Harris was calm, affectionate version of Albus Dumbeldore. His countenance makes him the Grandfather figure of Harry.
Robbie Coultrane as Hagrid leaves an imprint which makes him the most loveable character in the series. His performance makes me emotional in the end.
Alan Rickman was compeling, Maggie Smith charming and IAN Hart as Voldemort voice freaking genius. Rest of the cast shines in their respective roles.Music of this film holds a special place in my life, It is a trapdoor to the days of my adolesence, I find myself in my school all the time.

A Good Start To The Franchise,"So Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore is set to hit cinemas next month and I thought this would be the time to go back and watch the films in The Harry Potter franchise, starting with the Philosophers Stone. So I watched it today and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young child find out he is a wizard and he is enrolled in a school for magic where he tries to learn more about himself.Main Character
A young Daniel Radcliffe plays Harry Potter and he does about as well as a child actor would do in the role. You care about Harry and there is that innocence about him that makes him easy to root for and support in his journey. But there is no denying that his acting ability isn't great, some of the delivery of his lines is cringe and I think this would have always been the case and at least with this film the youth of the character was a hinderance in terms of performance quality.Supporting Characters
The same could be said for Rupert Grint and Emma Watson's first performances as Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. They have clear characters and they do the best they can, Ron is quite funny and Hermione is smart but sometimes it can't be conveyed well enough because of the inexperience of the performers. The seasoned actors all do great jobs, Maggie Smith is really fun as Professor McGonagall and I like how she is as the teacher and her dynamic with the three kids is handled and Smith seems to be having plenty of fun. Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid is also really entertaining to watch, he is such a jolly character and he is kind of a mentor to Harry, which is one of my favourite parts of the film. The late Alan Rickman plays Severus Snape and he is just brilliant in the role, he has become iconic and this is the start of his run as the character. Richard Harris plays Dumbledore and honestly he doesn't have lots of screen time but when he does, he is a presence and I really like how they treat him as this ultimate wizard despite having a smaller presence in this film.Story
The story does a really effective job of introducing us to the Wizarding world and getting us to instantly care about our main character and this new world that was created. I really enjoyed seeing the different lessons of Hogwarts and things like Quidditch. But this film does feel a little bit unbalanced, the last act has a reveal that doesn't quite work and I think it just meanders a bit in its storytelling. It has so much to tell us that it sometimes feels like exposition dumps even if it is entertaining.Script
The script is good, there are some pretty funny moments in the film and as I have said a few times I did care about the characters and when they were actually in peril. Don't get me wrong it isn't perfect but I think it does an effective enough job of introducing us to this franchise and the story that will not only be told in this film but plenty of sequels.Style
For a film that came out over 20 years ago the effects are still pretty good and seeing the wizarding on screen is always fun. Also, despite the story being a bit passive, I actually thought it was paced quite well and something interesting was happening on screen.Overall
Overall, Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone is a good start to the franchise that does the job well of starting this franchise and getting the young actors off to a start.Rating - 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

"A tremendous, though flawed, romp for children","I saw Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone last night with a friend of mine. It is the first time that I have seen a Harry Potter film. The movie is highly entertaining and enthralling. Richard Harris, as the old wizard, is the movie's Yoda and, in fact, there are many similarities between this movie and the original Star Wars trilogy. Spiritually superior kid Harry (Luke Skywalker) is sent to live with foster parents until he receives his calling to study wizardry (the force) and make his way as a powerhouse in the world (or galaxy.) The movie's weak spot is it's acting among the three main children. Harry is a super mature young person, scary for someone who's really just a kid and should be acting like one. His buddy, Weasely, is in the film as comic relief and no doubt received one acting command ""Look scared."" This he does often and well. The little girl (sorry don't remember her name and can't back arrow) is as cute as she can be but isn't a tremendously talented actress at this point in her young life. The backbone of the movie is it's delightful old guard. Maggie Smith, as delightful as ever, plays a witch/professor. Her presence and her voice are still absolute magic (important for a film about magic!) Robbie Coltrane is a great big teddy bear and he creeps into our hearts. John Cleese is a perfect casting move as Nearly Headless Nick, the almost headless ghost that hangs around the Hogwarts school. Alan Rickman is absolutely stone cold cool as the dark Professor Snape. He is so darn rigid that he talks almost without talking. There are tremendous little details in the movie, such as images in old paintings coming to life, that make the movie rich and absolute fun to look at. The plot is decent, although it's not very tight and there are reaches and lots of guesses (most of them correct) along the way when we think, ""How could they know that?"", etc. The movie is also delightfully (the last time I'll use the word delightful) English, told in a lighthearted and intellectual fashion.

Best film this year!,"I really enjoyed this film. It was entertaining, and very fun to watch. I haven't read the books, so it was a fresh start to Harry Potter. It was funny, exciting, and great for everyone in the theatre I went to too. The cinematography, and special effects were nice too.

Never thought this could be so nice !,"Okay there here we go I thought watching a movie done for children. All the advertisements for it, the articles about the books and the movie and finally my boss, referring the books to me made me have a closer look at all this. When I started to read the Sorcerer's Stone I was quite amazed. People on the train looked at me, a 25 year old guy reading a childrens book, not stopping to laugh...I was that amused that I decided to stop reading until I saw the movie and I can tell you : This one's a great one. Nice characters : Harry, Hermine, Ron, wonderful effects, good action ( I loved the Wizard's chess match at the end ), some good scary effects packed in a nice story. What else do you want ? This one was definitely one of the better ones in 2001 and is a good appetizer for the sequels to come.

Titanic waste of talent and money,"Awful. The biggest Xmas turkey of all time. The book has taken the world by storm and yet there's not enough in the movie to interest anybody other than die hard fans who feel they can't miss the incarnation of their favourite characters.Principal blame must be laid at the door of the mindnumbingly unimaginative script. Robbie Coltrane is one of the greatest comic actors of all time - right up there with WC Fields - and despite appearing twice lifesize with an hilarious costume, his funniest line is ""I don't think I was supposed to tell you that"". Criminal delinquence abounds - Alan Rickman  utterly wasted, John Cleese given two lines of exposition, Julie Walters, Ian Hart, Zoe Wanamaker given nothing at all to work with. Living with Dursleys looks like it might be more interesting than Hogwarts, largely because Richard Griffith and Fiona Shaw can turn even this ham into something tasty.And then there's the truly awful, pedestrian direction, which shows most in the failure to extract a single memorable second from the obvious acting talent and leaves the suggested talent, particularly that of Daniel Radcliffe and the amazingly promising Emma Watson, totally untapped.I'm sure the reason behind the book's success is that it got kids thinking - using their imaginations. It certainly doesn't appear to have worked on the crew of dismal underachievers responsible for the film.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Too faithful to be imaginative,"I have to own up that I am no fan of Harry Potter series. I read The Sorcerer's Stone partly because my girlfriend who completes all four HP's recommends them highly and partly out of curiosity. I finished it in two or three days and find it not so good as people said. We can see similar stock characters and typical stories in classics such as Charles Dickens' works and other novels intended for kids: a bereaved child in a hostile environment is recognized as the center of some important events and a respect figure. But this is for kids, and I have no objection for that. This Sunday I took my girlfriend to see the movie she had expected so long, only found it worse than the original book. Many viewers mention that the film omits too many quotes and episodes on the book, however this is not what I object to. When dealing with a literary work, a film director has to decide what to put in the flick and what to leave out; a movie can not include all characters or plots, or audience will be bored, and Warner Bros. will be broke. My opinion is just the opposite to these diehard fans: the director should cut off more irrelevant plots to make this film more tightly organized, like what he did when making Home Alone. Columbus is too concerned about satisfying book fans that he fails to edit the story into a more organic whole; the result is that he deletes the beginning as well as the resolution of many episodes to shorten runtime. But by doing this, he is being unfair to non-readers of HP. I think many moviegoers without prior knowledge of the story will be bewildered by some important scenes. Furthermore, the director doesn't make Harry Potter and other characters more vivid. If the actor doesn't have the extraordinary smile and innocent look, many viewers might lose interest on him. The earlier mirror episode provides an excellent chance to dig deeper inside Harry Potter's psychology and desire, which will make us identify and sympathize more with the boy, but the director doesn't hold on to the chance and let it slip away. We can see many great British actors in this film, all wasted in the flat narrative style. Columbus might cast them out of their appearance, and makeup might be the best thing in this blockbuster. You don't frown when characters show up--they look just the way they are supposed to look. This is an attempt to translate words into images, and that's the only thing Columbus does.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Spellbinding magic that just misses the mark,"There's little doubt that the first of the Harry Potter movies is going to be one of the highest grossing films of all time.

He does very well, but, in my opinion, he falls a little short.The film certainly has a magical feeling to it, and the two and a half hours simply fly by.  Adults and children alike will be more than entertained. But as a die hard Potter fan i was dissapointed by the cuts that had to be made to Rowling's work.  Where was Peeves, the sorting hat song, the howlers?  The lack of these and other details hurt the end result.Hermione Granger was perfectly played, Ron Weasley was spot on and very funny.  Hagrid was a treat, McGonagel the personification of 'strict but fair' school mistrisses and Snape was truelly mean.

Decent film,"As a faithful rendering of the book squeezed into a two-and-a-half hour period, the movie is beautifully done. I don't have a single complaint about any of the actors, who successfully bring to life, with the aid of costume design and special effects, the many colorful characters from the book. My favorite character, the giant Hagrid, is played by Robbie Coltrane, and I say with no exaggeration that he is exactly how I imagined him while reading the book. It's as if they took the image in my mind and transferred it to the screen. While I had my own personal image of Snape (for some reason, I always imagined him as the head villain from another Chris Columbus film, ""Adventures in Babysitting""), Alan Rickman is perfect in the role. I usually expect to have words of criticism for some performances, but I just don't. The remaining adult actors, including Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall and Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, are as good as they possibly could be, and the kids do an excellent job of holding their own against these veterans. Some have criticized Daniel Radcliffe for appearing too subdued in the title role, but that's exactly how the character is portrayed in the book: modest, unassuming, and laid-back. The kids who play Harry's two best friends are flawless.I had a lot of worries about the fact that it was being directed by Chris Columbus, whose entire directorial career so far has consisted of over-the-top slapstick films. I was pleasantly surprised that he did not direct the Harry Potter film in this way. Except for brief moments like the children's delayed reaction to a giant three-headed dog they encounter and Harry's swallowing the quaffle ball, there is nothing here to remind us that this film is directed by the same person who gave us films like ""Home Alone"" and ""Mrs. Doubtfire."" Indeed, I think Columbus may have gone just a tad bit too far in trying not to make the film seem cartoony. I would have liked to see a little more emotion on the actors' faces at certain times. Overall, however, his restraint works nicely in giving the film the kind of believability the book possesses.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

I don't know if it was what I thought it would be.,"I was somewhat disappointed in the movie. I don't think they did a great job making it as magical as it should be. I think they could have put a little more effort in making the Quidditch match, and spells seem a little more real, and not look so computer-animated.Actually, I really didn't want a movie made at all. The Harry Potter books were the one series that brought kids AWAY from the television, and allowing them to use their imaginations. All the movie is doing is saying, ""Come back, and watch TV more. Let us create an image of everything so there is no room for your own creativity.""I also thought that the actors could have a little more expression in their faces. Just as an example, when ""Hermione"" was being cornered by the troll, she looked as if she was just simply looking into the face of her mother or something. If a creature that huge was looking down at me, I know I would have a horrified look on my face. I'm not criticizing the actors, maybe the crew didn't do that well.I must say I was very disappointed in the end of the movie. My favorite part was when ""Hermione"" figured out the complicated riddle of potions, but that was missing in the movie!! I think they added too much not-so-important-scenes and took out too many important scenes. How did they suddenly get from one chamber to the last one?

I forgot how good this film was,"What else can I say about the world of Harry Potter that hasn't been said already? After the first book came out, everyone was going crazy for Harry Potter. But then Potterheads minds were blown when in 2001, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was released. The film was directed by Chris Columbus and stars Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, John Cleese, Robbie Coltrane, Warwick Davis, Richard Griffiths, Richard Harris, Ian Hart, John Hurt, Alan Rickman, Fiona Shaw, Maggie Smith, and Julie Walters. The film was a huge success financially and critically and luckily won fans of the books over and continued with seven more films plus three spinoff films.Harry Potter is an ordinary boy who lives with his aunt and uncle and is poorly treated. He finds out that he is a wizard and that his parents, who died when he was a baby, were wizards too. He goes to Hogwarts where he starts his education to become a wizard.I remember going through a Harry Potter phase in elementary school. Having read all the books and watched all the movies and even played some of the video games (primarily Lego Harry Potter). The world that the books and movies created were something that I could easily escape into. Nearly 10 years after going through that Potter phase, I decided to return to the movies and I must say that I forgot how good this first film is. Is it perfect? No. What has been said about this film has been said millions of times by other viewers. Sorcerer's Stone serves more as an introductory film to this magical and magnificent world. Chris Columbus and the rest of the crew had a lot of hard work to do to pull this film off and the end result is fantastic overall. Many book to movie adaptations fail due to numerous issues, mainly being not faithful to the source material which this film has no problem with. Everyone working on this film had so much love, dedication, and respect to the source material that it is no wonder why fans of the books had such a positive reaction to this film upon release. As previously stated, Sorcerer's Stone serves as an introductory film here. In that regard, it executes it flawlessly. Brilliant set pieces , a fantastic John Williams score, and fantastic characters are all what makes this film pretty magical. The casting of all the film's characters are spot on as I cannot picture any other actor or actress playing any of the characters in the film. The film does a nice job at appealing to viewers of all ages. The overall lightheartedness of the film and magical wonder easily appeals to kids and the film's moments of that have a bit of darkness to it can appeal to the older audience as well. But the film has a few minor problems. The film seems to have no building of suspense at all when it comes to the plot at hand and it really isn't until the last half hour or so until the plot really gets moving but again, it is only minor considering that most of the film is building this world up for us and does that flawlessly but the film does have a runtime at over two and a half hours so it did make me wonder if the film was being a bit excessive on the world building. Perhaps a bit more focus on plot would make this a near flawless film. My other minor complaint is the computer effects in this film. A lot of the time, it is very convincing but there are a few instances where the effects are heavily dated. As much as people praise the Quidditch scene, I have to say that is where the computer effects are a bit dated. Full character CGI is used and is very noticeable but I can say that for 2001 it probably did not look that bad.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a triumph in what it sets out to be and a large part of Harry Potter's success can largely be traced to this film. It is a film that should be able to appeal to fans and non fans alike.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

A gentle introduction to a captivating world,"With billions upon billions of pounds in revenue generated from book sales, film adaptations and all other mediums, and with the hysteria surrounding the series now all but gone, it seemed the perfect time to re-visit the Harry Potter film franchise. I'll state outright that I'm a fan of the books: they are hardly ground-breaking pieces of literature, but they are a meticulously crafted and widely imaginative set of novels, maturing with it's progression and with the age of it's characters and readers. The movie adaptations were consistently average, fiercely loyal to J.K. Rowling's prose but always somewhat lacking in substance.Shut away in the cupboard under the stairs by his adoptive parents (Richard Griffiths and Fiona Shaw), 11 year-old Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) lives an unhappy life. But there's something different about him, as he learns when he talks to a snake at a zoo and makes the protective glass disappear, causing his vile cousin Dudley Dursley (Harry Melling) to fall into the tank. His life changes when he is invited to enroll at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The invitations are burned by the Dursleys, and they go to great lengths to stop him going to a place that will teach him magic, until he is rescued by a hairy giant named Reubus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane).When introduced into the magical world with Hagrid, Harry learns that he is famous. His parents were killed by an evil wizard named Lord Voldemort (generally referred to as You-Know-Who), but Harry survived the attack, seemingly killing Voldemort and inflicting Harry with a lightning bolt scar on his forehead. When he gets to Hogwarts, he is befriended by the bumbling Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and the precocious Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and the three are quickly embroiled in a plot involving murdered unicorns, a mysterious artefact known as the philosopher's stone, and a giant three-headed dog.Philosopher's Stone is almost defiantly faithful to the books. Sure, lines are altered here, and minor characters are snipped out there, but this is as close as literally 'bringing a book to life' gets. Yet while this works in it's favour in terms of visualising Rowling's creations, it doesn't even try to develop any ideas of it's own that would have only worked in a visual medium. Much of Rowling's silly and charming sense of humour is lost in simply filming whatever happens on the pages. One of the main criticism's I have for the books is that a lot of the major characters are little more than archetypes, so a lot rested on the three young leads' shoulders in making us interested enough to stick with them.Sadly, two of the three fall rather flat, with only the gurning and hang-dog Rupert Grint showing a natural gift for appearing on the big screen. Potter is a simple enough character anyway, at least he is at this point of the story, shy, naive but brave, but Radcliffe gives an incredibly one-note performance, encapsulated in the scene in which he discovers he can perform magic. ""I'm a... wizard?"" he says, lacking anything resembling a facial expression. Watson also struggles to bring much likability to her self-satisfied bookworm, her eyebrows constantly rising and falling as she struggles to perform her lines with any conviction.For the rest of the cast, director Chris Columbus has rounded up a smorgasbord of British and Irish talent, a collection of well-trained thespians who steal the entire film from it's leads. Richard Harris plays Professor Dumbledore, Hogwarts' headmaster, Maggie Smith is Professor McGonagall, head of Gryffindor, the house Harry is chosen for, Alan Rickman is Professor Snape, Harry's greasy-haired Potions teacher, and John Hurt makes a small appearance as a wand-maker. Coltrane probably steals the film as the beast-loving grounds-keeper Hagrid. It's an amazing line-up that would consistently grow both in talent and in numbers as the films progressed.Ultimately, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a success, weaving an interesting enough story about the possible return of the dark lord Voldemort, with Harry's wide-eyed introduction to the world of hocus pocus. John Williams' Oscar-nominated and now widely recognisable score captures some of the giddy movie magic of early Spielberg, and the attention to detail is often remarkable. But like the book, it ultimately suffers from being too kid-friendly, spoon-feeding lessons in morality without giving much for adults to chew on. It's little more than a well-told children's story, something that would change as the novels became darker and more complex, but at this point, it's a gentle introduction to a captivating world.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

A fine adaption,"I know I'm about ten plus years late to probably garner any opinion valid or relevant but considering I read the book as a kid and don't remember much of that reading I'm glad I'm deciding to read the books now.Anyway, the Sorcerer's Stone is a well-done adaptation of J. K. Rowling's novel. Just finished reading the first book last night, and I was very eager to revisit the film and do a comparison viewing.While personally I'd say I prefer the film (which admittedly is a bit unfair considering I'm more of a cineaphile than a bookworm), I did enjoy the book and film immensely.Though I will say I think there are positives and negatives to both novel and film. The first act was fantastic in establishing the world and its characters. The film script, in way of writing and dialogue, I felt was much stronger. I found myself thinking that often the books writing was simple and dialogue at times poor. Though in defense of the novel, it is a children's book, as well as some of the films' most iconic lines are ripped directly from the book.Also, the film unfortunately never really went deeper into Professor Snape or Professor Quirrell. They were both more prominent in the book and it was a shame neither of them had more screen time as Ian Hart (Professor Quirrell) and Alan Rickman (Professor Snape) gave fantastic performances and brought those book characters to life. Which will bring me to say the entire cast did just as good of a job. Every actor truly became their character, and they all mirrored their book counterparts fantastically.Irregardless, most of the changes that were made I felt were for the best as it made sense when translating events from page to screen.Overall, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a fine adaption and an enjoyable film.IMDb: 7/10

Harry Potter is okay.,"In Harry Potter, the main character Harry, is orphaned when his mother and father were supposedly killed in a car accident so he is forced o go live with his aunt and uncle, The Dursleys. Since his aunt and uncle are muggles, normal people, they don't tell him that he is a wizard, because they just want him to be a ""normal"" person. He is soon rescued from his aunt and uncle by Hagrid who is a wizard back at Hogwarts. Harry then learns about his past and is introduced into the world of witches and warlocks.I liked to movie of Harry Potter a lot more than the book, because in the book they had a lot off unnecessary scenes that they could've done without. I like how in the movie they keep the movie going by not prolonging any of the scenes and making you wait to see what's going to happen. I think that overall in the movie the acting done by the characters was really good. They each played their part well and had the emotion that was needed for each scene to have an effect on the movie and keep it flowing. In the book, Rowling has a brief part where she talks about how Harry's life was growing up and his childhood, but in the movie it wasn't shown at all so that was one part that I think that the directors should've shown. The special effects in my opinion, were really really good because even though you knew that it couldn't be real, it still made you believe that it was. To me, the script writers did a good job in portraying the book without taking out too much or adding unnecessary information.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

One of the best adaptions from book to movie.,"This is one of the greatest movies I've seen this year, if not the best I've seen this year. It's a great adaption from the book, which was outstanding also. The movie had a great character developement, as well it had great special effects, plot, acting, and everything else you look for in a movie. The movie does live up to it's hype, which is unusual in the movie industry for the last quite a few years. Much to most of your people's and critics' dismay, I liked Pearl Harbor. So for me, Pearl Harbor also lived up to it's hype. But lets get to the Harry Potter issue. Daniel Radcliffe's portrayal of Harry was fantastic, along with his two best friends Hermoine (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grinn).After reading other people's negative comments, (don't get me wrong, most of them were positive) they said it wasn't good because they left too much out from the book. Let's think about it here, shall we? Movies are suppose to be different from the book. It's been said a million times, NOT metaphorically speaking. Yes, the book is better, but just a tad better. I have to say this is the best adaption from book to movie since Jurassic Park. But for Jurassic Park, I'm currently reading the book which I'm enjoying thoroughly, although I actually like the movie a little more, so far. But if you haven't read the book of Harry Potter, read it, because it's one of the best books I ever read. My favorite book ever would have to be it's second outstanding sequel Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. So when you get the chance read the series of Harry Potter and read them in miracle order, otherwise you won't like them most likely.The plot is the same from the book, so just figure that out for yourself. I also read a comment by a person who hated the movie. They said they didn't read the book before either. Once again, I say this. The book is different from the movie! When you get a chance to see this movie, see it. But read the book first. I hope you love the movie just as I did, because Chris Columbus did a fantastic job. Chris Columbus knew what he was doing when he took the job to do this phenonema. So one thing to tell you Chris, bring on #3 and #4. The first Harry gets a 10/10. Expect to here from me again after Chamber of Secrets, because my expectations are high. I also forgot to mention, that the quidditch scene and wizard's chess is awesome.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
An excellent movie adaptation of the novel,"There will be new cuts and different packaging, yet the basic film/screenplay will be the same.The movie as with most movies will deviate or adjust from the book to the big screen.The basic primes are of a boy who grows up as the orphan nephew of a family that does not believe in magic, only to find that he is a famous wizard. How will he manage his situation and interact with new friends?The movie itself, as with all movies, would have to be a mini-series to incorporate all the nuances of the book. However, this movie does an excellent job of selection and gives the overall feel of the story.Naturally by comparing and contrasting this story with others in its genre you will always find a better or a favorite. This in no way diminishes the excellent story and the cohesiveness of the movie.They chose good actors that will carry us through the series of Potter movies and beyond.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Special effects instead of magic, and the flat performance","Well, I would expect more from the most expected movie of the year. But if I start thinking what EXACTLY I would expect, I would hardly find an answer. The technical capabilities of the film-makers allow to create very astonishing and exciting special effects, but when it comes to magic, something even more special has to be done about it. I mean, I didn't really see a lot of magic on the screen - rather the special effects. The magic objects are acting on their own, not by the magic forces. A ""magic"" seen in a circus is more real than that seen in the ""Harry Potter"", most likely because the actors' play and the special effects are filmed separately and then mixed together. Consequently, the actors (mostly children) have to perform ""as if"", i.e. standing in the green room or somewhere and imagining a magic happening next to them and expressing emotions to the void. For me, this is the explanation why the characters are not that ""live"" and made up mostly of the cliches: a wicked guy always grins, a smart girl always manifests her outstanding knowledge, a clumsy boy would always fail to cast the spells. As I didn't read the book, I can't tell if the characters in the book are same flat and stereotypical, but I have an impression that it's the easiness of reading that contributed to the great popularity of the book. And I really doubt about the success of the movie because the flatness of the book would offer one to imagine what is not described, while the flatness of the movie leaves the ""imagination tanks"" in one's mind filled but partly.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
For entertainment it is a masterpiece,"'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is one of the most entertaining films I know.

Saved by the cast,"Chris Columbus' faltering direction leaves much to be desired from this otherwise magical first entry into the Potter film franchise.Steve Kloves delivers an inspired conversion of Rowling's classic first installment into a screenplay - giving much potential for a capable director to produce a magical film.Unfortunately, Chris Columbus is not an example of such a director; he almost manages to destroy this script, delivering a painfully static, overly faithful interpretation of a timeless children's classic. Yes, Columbus does leave a sense of welcome innocence on the finished product, but only in the same way as he did with Home Alone.Thankfully, an outstanding cast of British actors cleans some egg off the producer's faces. The magical casting department chose a cast who would deliver some fantastic performances. Richard Harris (Professor Dumbledore), Maggie Smith (Professor McGonagall), Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) and John Hurt (Ollivander) all give staggering renditions of their timeless characters. Alan Rickman's Severus Snape proves to be the most incredible performance piece in this picture - he makes Snape his own, bringing all the malice, hidden bravery and dark sarcasm needed to perfectly portray his character.Disregarding the Columbus blunder, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone proves itself to be a magical piece of cinema which will surely be enjoyed by audiences both young and old for many generations to come.Directing: 1/10||Cinematography: 8/10||Acting:7/10||Verdict: 5.3/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Fantastic adaptation - visually stunning.,"My favourite part was when the staircases changed (Simon age 7).We went as a family and we were all very impressed.

"Good for fans, blah for others","Harry Potter was an okay movie. It was not a particularly good movie. All of the atmosphere from the books was just plain missing... It was a faithful plot rendering, but it was not gripping. You don't get emotionally wrapped in what happens, and you just don't care what happens to these people. If you've already read the books, then Harry et al. already mean something to you, so it's okay-- but if you haven't, you're in for a yawn. The movie was also lacking a lot of the books' wit... presumably because they couldn't fit anything else in.I think anyone who's a HP fan will enjoy the movie, but people who haven't read the books won't. The movie doesn't make you care about the characters: it depends on you to already care. It caters directly to the fans that will graft their OWN understanding of Harry et al. onto the screen exposition, who aren't depending on the movie to show them what these characters are like, because they already know. To anyone who's seen the movie and hasn't read the books, I'd say: Go read them even if you didn't like the movie; what the film most painfully lacks, the books actually do supply.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Charming and Endearing!,"How sad it is to begin the reader's comments with a whining, complaining, drone against everything about this movie. Why not pick a balanced view. Good grief! Did someone poison your dog? It made it sound like this doesn't compare favorably with ""Hamburger: The Movie."" I am a over fifty years old and thought I would be pretty lukewarm to a ""kids"" movie. I have been listening for a year to kids raving about the Harry Potter books. Their eyes light up--they are enthused about a ""book."" When I went to see it, I had just read the book the night before because I like to see how they translate. The script was delightful.

The characters are bad. Daniel Radcliffe is a very bad actor. Many other better actors could be chosen. I think he was chosen just because he looks like the Harry Potter on the front cover of the book. The costumes are bad. The special effects are bad.

Three things wrong with the film . . .,"There are three things wrong with this film: it's not reality; it's not a book; and it's not bad.With the weight of expectation on Chris Colombus and Daniel Radcliffe's shoulders, everyone seems to have forgotten that this is a film, and NOT a book. Even though it's two and a half hours long, there was never any way in which it could be a completely faithful adaptation of the book. Characters who are lightly sketched in the book had to be sacrificed to ensure that the story worked. And ultimately, that was what had to happen on screen, that the story flowed for both fans of the book and also cinema-goers who would have no idea of what Harry Potter was all about. The loss of the Dursleys' opening scenes will most likely be rectified by later films, since they appear as bookend characters. Poppy Pomfrey, Peeves, Polkiss, the mention of Mrs Figg, the rest of the Potter family in the Mirror of Erised: all of these omissions are reasonable in light of this film introducing a series of stories.The first twenty minutes are, I think, the true test of the audience. For those who've read the books, it probably takes too long to get to the story proper, leaving out all the active, conflict-filled moments, such as Harry's first encounter with Malfoy and his cronies, most of Harry's life with the Dursleys, and the set-up of Neville's forgetful nature. For someone coming to it cold, it probably whips by too quickly, leaving too much said by characters rather than dramatised by action; remember that actions speak louder than words, and never more so than in the movies.Once in the second act, however, the story reaches its tone quite quickly, and there are moments of sheer brilliance, including the entry into the Great Hall, Harry's first broomstick flight, the Quidditch match, the Invisibility Cloak, the emotional tone of the Mirror of Erised, and every single thing about the Dark [Forbidden] Forest.Daniel Radcliffe plays the cipher of Harry Potter to perfection. He's never completely certain about his actions unless it's for the sake of his friends or the memory of his family. He's an Everyman, whose greatest characteristic is loyalty. The only problems he has are during the first act, which is a difficult part of the film anyway. From the entry to Hogwarts onwards, however, he's a joy to watch: his delight in his friendships, in being recognised for his strengths, the emotional rollercoaster he endures during the Mirror of Erised sequence, you can see exactly why Chris Colombus held out for Dan's casting. I think if anyone has a problem with Dan's performance, it's because he's not a broad, visual actor, but one where everything is a slight shade of subtlety. Similarly, Harry is not a broad comic character like Ron, nor an over-achiever like Hermione; he's the rock against their wind and water.Rupert Grint is just brilliant, with the timing of a comic genius, the rubber-faced contortions of a master, and the emotional range of actors many years his senior. We can expect great things from Mr Grint.Emma Watson in her first screen role is the supporting lady that Harry Potter needs. I believed every moment she came out with the right information, I believed that she had feelings to be hurt, and I believe that she has so much more in her to come. I hope we get to see all that this riveting young actress is capable of.Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid makes him not only menacing at need, but also loveable beneath that hair. I'm sure that many actors would have felt overwhelmed by the costume, the make-up and the prosthetics, but Robbie inhabits the part. Jo was right to have him in mind. I can't wait to see him with Cher as Madame Maxime.Before I saw the film, I never thought that there would be any other actors who would stand out in such a cast of great youngsters and well-established names, but Sean Biggerstaffe as Oliver Wood and Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy are two stars in the making. Sean's Oliver is strong, visionary and above all, funny, and I foresee great things for him. Tom Felton brings Draco to life, much more so than Harry Melling as Dudley, making Draco sly and superior, but also vulnerable and comic, and I can't wait to see more of his turn as Harry's school nemesis.Richard Harris, Dame Maggie Smith and Zoe Wanamaker's characters are somewhat backgrounded by the antics of their students, but then the film IS called Harry Potter and the Philospher's Stone, so it can only be expected. They provide a great mix of adult role models, and a strong backbone for the human side of Hogwarts.Of course, any film of Harry Potter would be nothing without the witchcraft and wizardy. As a filmgoer, I never expected to see reality, since magic doesn't yet exist in our world, so how would we know what it looks like? To complain that the CGI was below par is amazing. The Burmese Python was fantastic, its motion absolutely believable. The Quidditch match and Harry's later solo pursuit of the winged key are literally breathtaking, and I felt my heart beating harder when Harry caught the Snitch. If CGI wasn't working there, I don't know when it was. I could go on, but I will just add that the Invisibility Cloak, from both outside and inside, was just inspired, and much better than I would have thought possible.Diagon Alley was amazing. To those detractors of the scenic design, just look at Mr Ollivander's shop: how many wand boxes can you see? And, do you think they were built on mainframes?There is so much more I could, and will say, but I'll stop here. Just enjoy it. It's a dream of a ride.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Inventive fantasy film...,"1st watched 11/20/2001 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Chris Columbus): Inventive fantasy film that appeals to young school-age kids in many different ways.  As I watched this movie in the theatre, surrounded by middle school kids, I understood  why they are captivated by this character, Harry Potter.  Not having read any of the books, but only having brief information fed to me by  my 9-year old I was unprepared for what this movie was really about.  I believe this character appeals to kids because #1 - he's from a broken home (like many young kids today), #2 - he's fighting against the evils of the world everyday(like many kids are at this age - trying to figure out what's right and wrong), #3 - it's fun (there was a tremendous game played at Hogwart's where the characters are flying on broomsticks where the pace is very fast like many video games that kids play today), #4 - the class mentality displayed at Hogwart's(similar to school rivalry's just blossoming with kids these days), and finally #5 - Harry wins and wins by playing by the rules(most of the time).  This is even fun  to watch for old-timers like myself (even though I had to get tips from my 9-year old every once in a while about what was happening on-screen, which she gave me unsolicited every couple minutes).  All in all this movie is basically a good time had for all.  Not taken seriously it is very appealing to people of all ages.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone one of the best book adaptations. The first film has a special atmosphere suitable for the Christmas holidays.

I can highlight Chris Columbus's skill in making children's films; he is good at working with young actors, knows how to make the plot interesting and accessible. In short, the first ""Harry Potter"" is a good film, a good original adaptation that gave several generations the atmosphere of Hogwarts. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Good potential, visually impressive, but...","Pros: Does justice to the book; excellent acting; good special effects.Cons: Not suitable for very young children; confusing storyline for those who haven't read the book(s).Need I write about the plot, when all four of the Harry Potter books have done so well and have been devoured by children and adults alike? To briefly enlighten those of you who, for some reason, (weren't you at least curious???) haven't even opened a Harry Potter book...Harry Potter is an 11-year-old orphan who is admitted into the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, mostly because his parents, who were killed by an evil magician when he was a baby, graduated from there.Each book of the series focuses on one academic year in the life of young Harry. The reader 'grows' with the character.The first book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, is more of an introduction than a book on its own, a sketch, rather than a complete painting. That is why, in my opinion at least, it shouldn't have been made into a movie in the first place. You would think a 2 1/2 hour-long adaptation should be sufficient. But it's not. Although it does justice to the book, especially in the portrayal of the characters (they're exactly as you would picture them to be!), it skips out many parts of the book. And since the book itself wasn't 'complete', how can you expect a movie adaptation to be completely fulfilling? I think the movie is almost incomprehensible to most of those who haven't read, not the book, but the entire series! The beginning must have puzzled them a great deal, and the ending was obviously rushed. The details revolving around the sorcerer's stone itself don't translate well from page to screen. Too many questions are left unanswered. And the satirical fun that made the books such an entertaining read was almost absent in the film.I can't stress enough on how fine the children's performance was. Daniel Radcliffe IS Harry Potter, at least physically he is. His expressions are very convincing. Unfortunately, director Chris Columbus doesn't allow his 'inner' feelings to surface much, except in one scene when Harry discovers a magical mirror that reflects one's deepest desires. It is only then that we feel Harry's pain for the loss of his parents. Also, the director doesn't succeed much in portraying Harry's miserable life when he is staying with his aunt, uncle and his fat cousin Dudley. In the book, he is the main character because we are allowed into his confused, painful, and sometimes happy feelings, in the movie he is the main character mostly because the title says so. Rupert Grint, who plays Ron, Harry's first and closest friend at school (my favorite character, actually!) was simply magnificent. His mimics when he is scared or confused are just adorable! Emma Watson (the slightly irritating but studious and audacious Hermione) was remarkable in her 'show-off' scenes. The adult characters were fine, but what is more important is that none of the kids were annoying or whiny.I was very disappointed with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named/Lord Voldemort though. The magician gave me the chills in the books, but was almost unnoticeable in the film. You would say: ""What??? THAT killed Harry Potter's parents? THAT is terrorizing the entire community of magicians that they wouldn't even speak out his name? Puhleeeeeeze! Even a kid watching this wouldn't feel the 'threat' of the character.""The hair and makeup were very well done, especially on Hermione, the gatekeeper Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), Headmaster Albus Dumbledore (an almost unrecognizable Richard Harris, folks!) and all of the female professors. The creatures however, especially the Centaur and the Goblin, looked very fake. Even the centaurs in Xena and Hercules looked more credible, for as much as a mythological character can look real anyway. ;)The effects involving the indoors of Hogwarts were surprisingly fantastic. I was impressed with the ghosts and the 'active' characters in the paintings.The setting was great! Hogwarts is THE fantasy place to be; a medieval castle with almost limitless proportions, moving staircases, elegant dormitories with vivid colors...And mouthwatering, well presented dishes for meals, folks! In contrast, the Black Forest has a dark and terrifying ambience, with predominant black and dark blue colors, as well as the inevitable thick mist.The soundtrack was fantastic; it provided a suitable background for the 'suspenseful' and 'witchy' parts of the movie. However, I could swear I heard an adaptation of the Wedding March in some scenes! Odd...I'll lighten up now, and conclude by saying that the overall movie was quite enjoyable, entertaining, etc.etc. Suitable for both children (not too young though, some scenes might scare them!) and adults. You will not get bored. But you might get confused. And it might leave you slightly unsatisfied.Your answer to this would be: ""Hey, be thankful that the book had material for at least 8 hours of film, yet it had been compressed into a 2 hour-and-a-half flick."" Well then, why make this into a movie at all? Why not make this into a mini-series? That would surely be a success. Every season will cover one of the books. And, as a series, it would seem perfectly normal if many questions were left unanswered during a few episodes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

"Great book, Good movie, poor editing","Being a fan of the Harry Potter series, I was of course very interested in seeing the adaptation of ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone"". Having now seen the film, I'm left with mixed feelings.I hadn't read the book in just over a year, so I came to this movie with as much of a blank slate as someone who has read the book can. I was familiar with the characters, knew the basics of the story, but had forgotten most of the important specifics. This is the way I wanted it. I wanted to rediscover things via the movie and then be able to say ""Oh Yeah, they sure did nail that"". Unfortunately, there were all too few moments like that for me.The adaptation, to say the very least, is exceptionally accurate. Very few novels have had such spot on adaptations made. Accuracy however does not a great movie make. The movie is good, but suffers from some of the worst editing I've ever encountered in a big budget motion picture. This is truly painful for me to say, because the man who edited this film, Richard Francis-Bruce, also edited some of my all time favourite films, including ""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""Seven"" and ""The Green Mile"". For some reason though, he has completely failed with Harry Potter. The movie's scenes are cobbled together in a very stilted, halting manner.RFB seems to have forgotten the cinematic language of editing in this film. Cuts denote little to no time passing, fades and dissolves denote the larger passage of time. In this film, We will cut from a scene of Harry in the kitchen, to another scene of harry in the kitchen which is supposed to take place several days later. The cut facilitating this however is so abrupt that if you haven't read the book, you will find yourself momentarily confused as you try to sort out where in the flow of the story this new scene is supposed to be. This kind of editing is prevalent throughout the movie. The film is in dire need of some transitional scenes and montage sequences in order to really give the sense of the passage of time.In spite of the lack-luster editing, the movie never feels slow or overlong, and clocking in at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I was surprised to find that I felt no more than 90 minutes could have possibly elapsed. I would have gladly sat in that theatre for another half hour or more, which would have been to the benefit of the film, allowing them to flesh out many of the things that are sorely missed. The ending, to those who haven't read the books, is going to feel clichéd and tacked on. An extra half hour, to flesh out the Dursley's, show more of the unfair point deductions from Gryffindor (thanks to one Prof. Snape) and to allow for some transitional montage scenes showing Harry and the gang in their various classes doing various magic things, would have helped the film out immensely. As it stands, you never really get the sense that Harry attends any classes at Hogwarts, as they are shown so briefly as to be quickly forgotten.Supposedly, the original rough-cut of the film was just over 3 hours long, and I very much hope that this cut makes it to DVD in the form of a directors cut, as any additional fleshing out of this movie can only be to its benefit.In conclusion, Harry Potter is a solid film, never feels as long as it actually is, and is a very accurate adaptation, but for all of that, there are definitely some major problems that could have been easily solved with better editing an additional scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Just a beginning,"First of eight films and set the tone. With a cast of young actors, and at the time minimal experience the film only lacked 'acting techniques'. Now, this is not to say Emma, Rupert and Daniel couldn't act. They could, it's more how they went around doing it. So, although this was a downer for me, the choices Warner Bros made was fantastic and they really suit there roles.The story starts very slow, which I found to be more symbolic, showing how Harry has a long, trapped life with the Dursleys. The story remains slow until Harry goes to Hogwarts where lots of things happen; Harry is introduced to Quittach, Trolls, Stealing etc.An action pact film full of amazing post production editing and magic to make the story feel real, make it feel alive. Snape's hatred of Harry Potter makes the scenes within Hogwarts always tense.

The director made it a lot like the book, and I really liked that about it!

Like Plastic? See this (supposed) movie,"I have not and have no intention of reading the books- nothing against them, they just aren't my cup o'tea. I hesitated seeing this film not because of no interest in those books- but because of the director- I have found his films to be trite and cheap and very formula- straight from the Speilberg school of ""once I've made my first ba-zillion I can sell out and never have to be creative again"". This film has good camera work. It has current state effects. It has a pace akin to running a 24fps film at 1000fps. It's shallow- it asks you to buy into all of it without explanation. There's a fakeness to it leaving me feeling like I had molten Saran-wrap poured over me. I don't care about the characters because they were simply place-holders- no personalities. Harry is so two-dimensional as to make a sheet of paper more intriguing. Perhaps the ""genre"" just doesn't appeal here. Fans (and most people are either a fan or not- no ""in-betweens"") ballyhoo this film with that glazed-eye look of cult religionists. Yuck.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Best Novel Adaptation Movie,"As a big fan of the books I will never forget this masterpiece of an adaptation.

I loved seeing all the adorable and beautiful owls; especially Hedwig who I believe is named after the patron saint of orphans Saint Hedwig! The mystery and the suspense of the story had me on the edge of my seat. The story was a great story about be kind, be courageous, be smart, be a good friend, don't ever commit murder, don't ever be selfish, and really take care of your family. All of the actors did great their roles. Therefore I'll always really like Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone! Have a great day and goooo Harry Potter!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Yes, I believe it deserves all the 8, 9, and 10 votes it has gotten.","First let me say I have not read any Harry Potter books, and I think that is an advantage to enjoying these Harry Potter films. Second, let me say I am a Christian and a grandfather, and I found the witchcraft not one bit troubling.  It's a movie, after all, and in the end ""love"" is the main quality Harry Potter is credited with.Even though the film is almost 2 1/2 hours long, it never seems too long. Perhaps that's because each step in the development of the characters is so interesting. The various stars are just perfect for their roles. I especially enjoyed Emma Watson as the precocious Hermoine. She is a good young actress and I enjoy her typically British facial contortions when making certain word sounds.For the young, or simply young at heart, the various depictions of ""magic"" are so much fun to watch. Hermoine read her assignments, memorized useful spells, and was always ready when the need arose. The broom flying lessons on the playground. The selection of the perfect magic wand in the wand store. Catching the train to Hogwarts on platform 9 3/4.  All highly entertaining. I can understand why the Harry Potter books are so popular, the author has a great imagination.When the film finally got around to action and excitement during its latter stages, it had a ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" feel to it, falling in a pit of wiggly things, making narrow escapes. And the one character that at first seemed meek, mild and handicapped, later turned out to be a villian, had a ""Usual Suspects"" feel to it. Just part of film evolution, every good thing influences things that come later.The DVD picture is remarkably sharp and colors realistic. The 5.1 surround sound and John Williams score complements the film very well. For collectors of good movies, a fine DVD to own. I'm happy that I have my own! :-)",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A surprisingly good version,"When I first heard that there was going to be a film remake of the Philosopher's Stone, I thought ""Oh no, they're going to ruin it."" Because as so many people have said in the past to me, a film version of a book is butchered. However, I went to see the film with high hopes, and thankfully, I wasn't disappointed.Christopher Columbus has managed to capture Harry Potter the way I don't think anyone else would've been able to. The casting was also brilliant, and it's nice to know with hardworking actors like Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson, the casting director wasn't wrong.Most of the storyline was able to be captured, which is good, because I would have been disappointed if important facts were forgotten (As they were in Prisoner of Azkaban, but that's another story.)

I'm not going to lie: I know that none of the movies will be able to truly capture the spirit of the books. Rowling's true world of Hogwarts lies in the realm of literature, and this is a different medium.That being said, it was a good movie. There are a few nitpicks concerning how I would've casted a few characters more to my liking, but I won't get into that, since probably everyone could complain about something. Overall, it was well cast. Harry looks the part, and Richard Harris as Dumbledore is excellent. Also, the world looks pretty much what one would think of when visualizing the book. Hogwarts especially looks great, and is full of mystery and life.The movie of course has to cut out some parts of the book, and I have no complaints concerning that. It sticks to all the main things very well, and the story is compelling and fun. Also, it manages to convey the light-heartedness and comedy that the books are full of. The acting is a little spotty, but then again, we're dealing with young kids here, and I'm sure that will improve as the series goes on.Sorcerer's Stone is full of adventure, comedy, danger, and magic, and is entertaining and fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A Timeless Return to Magic,"Revisiting Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is an enchanting experience that brings back the magic that defined not only this film but the entire saga. Whether through the books or the movies, the Harry Potter series has been a source of joy, and this first installment remains a delightful journey into the wizarding world.The film's charm lies in its ability to cater to audiences of all ages. What was once a childhood favorite continues to captivate, and with each viewing, new layers and details emerge. The richness and intricacy of the universe crafted by J. K. Rowling make every return to Hogwarts a fresh adventure.As the opening chapter of the saga, Sorcerer's Stone masterfully lays the groundwork for the epic battle between Harry Potter and Voldemort. The film introduces each character, setting the stage for their individual evolutions throughout the series. Notably, characters like Severus Snape, initially perceived as the stern antagonist, reveal layers of complexity as the story progresses.The film serves as a timeless introduction to the magical world, portraying the relationships that will shape the narrative in the subsequent movies. The chemistry between the main trio-Harry, Ron, and Hermione-evolves from the first sparks of friendship into a powerful bond that becomes the heart of the series.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is not just a film ; it's an initiation into a universe where spells, mythical creatures, and moral choices create a tapestry that transcends generations. It sparks a desire to delve into the subsequent chapters, eager to witness the characters' growth, the unfolding mysteries, and the epic battles that await.With its blend of wonder, humor, and adventure, this film is a testament to the enduring magic of the wizarding world-a magic that continues to resonate with audiences, old and new, making every return to Hogwarts a cherished and timeless experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Magical from start to finish,"What else can I say but brilliant. True to it's word Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone kept close to the book. Chris Columbus and the rest of the crew clearly listened to JK Rowling when they were making this. Obviously changes had to be made to the story or we could have ended up with a film of more than 3 hours. Nearly every scene was what I pictured it would be. The special effects were fantastic and the game of Quidditch was very spectacular. All the characters fitted effortlessly into the film and every actor was suited to the part they played. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were perfect as are three heroes, but every other actor involved helped to bring the book to life, however brief their appearance.If you haven't read the books then I recommend you do so before or after seeing the film. However the film does speak for itself and people who haven't read this book won't be lost. I won't give away the ending to anyone who doesn't know what happens.Adults and kids alike will enjoy this, I did and I'm not under 12.

Why have I been missing out!?! - Follow my intsagram @thelittlefilmreview,"So I may be 17 years late to the Harry Potter fanatics, but better late then never. Why have I been missing out all these years? So if you are like me, and never got round to watching the most known film series then you need to get a move on. It has a wonderful fantasy storyline from start to finish, which is makes you feel so invited into the magical world of Hogwarts.
For a film that is nearly 2 decades old now, it was a pleasant surprise how good the graphics were, you truly believe that there is such thing a magic. Another thing that surprised me was the quality of the acting for young adolescents. Even from the first film you can understand to why they were able to carry on for another 7 more, the relationships are already building like a real school environment. Little scenarios in this film are seen as obviously, but the overall view is that after this film, it will make you want to watch the next.
What I like about this film is that it can be watched by children, teenagers and adults and passed along the generations. The added humour, jokes and 'sassyness' makes the film lighthearted and enjoyable.Personally I'm not one for long films unless it truly grips me, and this film done just that. I just couldn't wait until the end, not because i wanted it to finish, but because it left me so curious to the conclusion of the film. And furthering that, I cant wait to watch the next one. However I'm not going to lie to you, I have nothing to compare it to, I have not read the books, and by some other reviews, the film didn't do it justice.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A good adaptation of Rowling's novel,"It certainly wasn't an easy task Chris Columbus took upon himself when he started working on adapting one of the most loved novels ever for the screen. I have to say that I was among those who felt almost upset when I heard that Columbus would direct the movie -- Home Alone, need I say more? I was doubtful if Columbus would be capable to go to darker places. I am happy to say that Columbus has stayed true to the source material in most ways. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a rather dark movie considering that it is a children's film. Luckily, there are some comic scenes as well -- though not nearly as many as in the book.The acting from the adult actors is brilliant -- as was only expected with such a cast! Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman, Richard Harris, Maggie Smith and my personal ""favourite"" Ian Hart (who doesn't have enough screen time, if you ask me) are all great. The child actors is another matter... Daniel Radcliffe has to look surprised, awed and scared all the time. It's kind of boring. I'm sure he will do better in the next movie when -- hopefully -- his eyebrows won't be at the edge of his scalp all the time. The best of the younger actors is without a doubt Rupert Grint who plays Ron. Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) is also good.There are certain aspects of the film that are absolutely brilliant. Cinematography, production design, costume design et cetera. Hogwarts, for example, looked almost exactly as I had imagined it.Harry Potter is a good movie. It's not great, but even if I am somewhat disappointed I still feel that there couldn't have been a better adaptation of the novel (well, perhaps Terry Gilliam could have done something brilliant with the source material). However, images can never replace Rowling's language and style. Believe me, the best H.P.-movie you will ever see is the one you see in your mind when you read the novel.Still, it is a job well done by Columbus and screenwriter Steven Kloves and everyone else who worked on the film.

Mind Numbingly Awful..,"Mind Numbingly Awful..If I was an eleven year old watching this film, I would have walked out of the cinema citing this as an insult to my intelligence. Don't believe the hype about Harry Potter as it is little more than a large cash cow that the studio execs signed up to drain as many children (and their parents) as possible of their cash.The story is atrociously bad, the acting not much better and the special effects pretty bad. The whole plot is utterly ridiculous and packaged together in a film so dreadfully written that it should never have made it into print let alone onto celluloid.It is extremely rare that a film, even a really bad unwatchable one makes me want to switch off before the end but I had to turn over after just ten minutes as I could not stand this utter codswallop any longer.And yet the popularity of this series seems never ending as sad people dress up their kids in badly imitated costumes from the films so they can queue up outside bookshops in the middle of the night to purchase the latest instalment. I appreciate that Star Wars makes fans queue around the block (Ok maybe not the tiresome prequel trilogy) but at least that has some redeeming features to it that do not insult the intelligence.Avoid this badly written claptrap at all costs!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Freshman year at Hogwart's passes the grade,"Although the first installment of the Harry Potter series falls slightly short of the all-encompassing magical experience it had hoped to be, one must admit it did come pretty close to a total triumph. Based on the insanely popular children novels from author J.K. Rowling, viewers are entertainingly introduced to the enchanted world of young witchcraft and wizardry which had captivated an inordinate number of readers. 30 minutes into the expensive film and it is completely clear why.Rowling has crafted an exquisitely, conceptually rich fantasy world which manages to combine many darker, reality-based themes and deal with them through the wondrous world of Hogwarts. It is in this immensely beguiling school a majority of the entire franchise will take place, and it is easy to see why. A new vernacular with which Rowling describes her alternate universe seemed to have resonated with many more people then expected, and in this satisfying introduction director Chris Columbus wastes hardly any time getting into the fun of it all. Not since the mid 80's have we seen such a lovingly detailed homage to children's fantasies, labored over in such a way that would make any hardened fan of the genre blush.Brought to life by a great cast, many experienced actors playing professors of the magic school only make these young trio of children, whom we will come to watch mature, that much more engaging. Daniel Radcliffe may have been a little over his head with this first installment, arguably overshadowed by his two co-conspirators. He nevertheless accomplishes the task of portraying the iconic shy boy wizard with a little directional and a whole lot of conceptual help, ushering in one of the more lucrative franchises of modern days.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry's Wondrous World,"I'm a big fan of Harry Potter; the books AND the movies. I can easily say that the first movie of the series is my favourite among all 8 HP movies, and it's also one of the most successful adaptations among films based on books. It must have been a huge challenge to reflect J.K. Rowling's amazing world to the big screen, and equally challenging to do so with three main characters who happen to be only kids at the very start of their acting career. However, everything's done so professionally that the magic in the book is transferred into a movie which is interesting for almost any age group in my opinion.

"Nice Start to a Great Series, but Poor Hagrid.","The movie ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is a story of one boy who has a terrible childhood. Harry is treated amazingly poorly by his aunt and uncle, who, despite his being an ""immense burden"", adopted Harry after his mother and father's death. Upon Harry's twelfth birthday his life begins to change; wild unexpected occurrences begin to frazzle Harry's aunt and uncle, but the result of the change is a whole new life of which Harry could not have dreamed.The movie in my opinion was pretty well done. Visually I think the CGI was great. Some of the action scenes  the ones on broomsticks in particular  were a bit cartoonish, but the overall visual experience was good. I think that the director did a good job of choosing the actors for this film. Dumbledore, the three protagonists, the Weasley twins, etc. were all great. Hagrid's character, on the other hand, was not as great, but I do not think it was the fault of the actor. First, his accent was impeccable. Second, he is visually a true match to Rowling's Hagrid. Where his character fails is in the lines that he was asked to memorize. Simple and repetitive. Rowling gave him many great lines and allowed us to get to know him. Why, script writers, did you not refer to Rowling's book when you asked the question: ""What should Hagrid say?"" In general I thought the writing for the film was OK, but Hagrid's dialogue was at best mediocre.The flow of the movie was good  it didn't drag at all. I thought overall the director stayed true to the book's plot with the exception of the beginning and the forest scenes with the centaurs.

This movie met my expectations,As a lover of the books I was concerned as to whether the film(s) would do them justice.  Despite this the pre-release hype and the cast list had led me to expect (or hope for) great things.  I am happy to say that I was impressed with the finished product.There was hardly a weak link in the cast - Hagrid and Ron standing out from the rest.  The film looked fantastic.  The blending of sets and CGI was (almost) seamless - some of the quidditch backgrounds and the centaur looked a little cartoony.

A poor adaptation,"This is a really poor adaptation of the book. Chris Columbus should go back to the Home Alone series.As a fan of the book, i cant believe how much he took out! This film is an absolute mess! Too many things are missed out. Fair enough, he's got to turn a whole book into a movie, which is hard. He completely changed some things! Like, for example, Harry and Hermione have detention in the forest because they are caught coming down from the tower after getting rid of Norbert (Ron isnt there). Malfoy and Neville also are caught out of bed and thats why they end up in the forest. Ron was not involved. He also took out important stuff from the book and STILL reffered to it later on in the film! He didnt really explain the Philospher's Stone enough either.This is a very poor adaptation for a poor director who let too much influence from Hollywood spoil what could have been a really 'magical' film.

Faithful and attractive adaption that lacks real spark.,"If ever there was proof of that cliche 'it's never as good as your imagination', this movie is it. It looks wonderful, has some great scenes and the casting is very good, but it does not match the charm, atmosphere and cleverness of the book. Ironically, you may very well enjoy it more if you've never read J.K Rowling's world famous novel, as I and some others who've seen it found it hard to get into the film, as we were watching it with half an eye for how accurately it fitted our visions rather than enjoying it purely for itself.The film's lacks can be summed up by a paradox: it is both too true and not true enough to the book. The film is a bit disjointed, with the changes between scenes not being as smooth as they could be, and I think this is because it is trying to follow the plot of the book as exactly as it could. The problem is that books and films are two different media, and what works in one will not necessarily work in the other. The film does not (and probably cannot, as the books do not have a narrator that the film could use) have the hidden voice of the author to fill in the gaps in the plot and add those little satirical touches that helped make the book so enjoyable for adults as well as children. This means that there are parts of the film that do not have the punch they do in the novel: for example the early scenes dealing with Harry's appalling foster parents are good, but they do not quite convey the wretchedness of Harry's 'normal' life as they do in the book, and despite Alan Rickman's disdainful drawl, Professor Snape is not as nasty as I imagined him. As a result there is not the tension surrounding whether Harry will get kicked out of the school and why it's so important that Snape's house Slytherin doesn't win the trophy. Perhaps this explains why parts of the film seem rather flat.The other significant problem I had with the film was that Daniel Radcliffe, who plays Harry Potter, does not have the energy and fun that the character does in the novel. He's not bad, and he does look very like I imagined Harry Potter to, but he seems a bit passive. Other than that the acting was pretty spot on - Robbie Coltrane is particularly good as Hagrid and the actors playing the teachers and the other kids all do an excellent job.The film's strengths are many and far outweigh it's weaknesses: some things are even better than I saw them in my head: Hogwarts looks magnificent in it's Gothic wierdness, the invisibility cloak is indeed very cool, the chess match is brutally satisfying and, most impressively, the Quidditch match is a triumph: full of hurtling broomsticks, violent collisions and flying bodies. It's like a cross between rugby and basketball in mid-air, and it rocks. The story is obviously a very good one and, while it isn't as scary as the book, it's good and dark for a movie aimed at kids as well as adults. I enjoyed it, and might enjoy it more on a second viewing, when it doesn't have the baggage of living up to a modern classic.RATING 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

I tend to have difficulty with movies over a 2 hr mark as I often find they use filler vs substance but that wasn't the case here, each scene was a proper progression to the story. I guess the only real detractors are I think the quidditch scene runs a little long, and wouldn't technically Harry be expelled for going into the restricted section and taking on Voldemort as a entry level wizard. That aside a really good film 4/5.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Wicked.,"I am a Harry Potter fanboy.  There, I've said it.  =)  I've been looking forward to this movie ever since I heard it was being made.  My expectations were nominally high, and I can safely say that they were all met.  With the exception of some very corny lines and actions towards the end, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was a flawless gem.  I loved every second of it, even if You-Know-Who ended up reminding me of Darth Vader.  John Williams' score only accentuated the effect, of course.  ^_~  Definitely a high 9/near 10 in my book.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Pure Magic That Brings Back Childhood Every Time,"Watching Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is like stepping into a time machine. No matter how many times I watch it, it never fails to transport me back to my childhood. The excitement, the wonder, and the joy of discovering Hogwarts for the first time-it's all still there.I first watched this movie on DVD at home, and I still remember how mesmerized I was. Back then, it felt like magic was real. The conversations with friends about the spells, the Sorting Hat, and how we all wanted to try Butterbeer made it even more special. We'd argue over which house we'd belong to and try copying the ""Wingardium Leviosa"" scene like pros!The movie itself is just perfect. The casting is spot on-Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint brought Harry, Hermione, and Ron to life exactly how we imagined them. The visuals are stunning, from the Hogwarts Express to the grand dining hall, and John Williams' music? Goosebumps every single time!Memorable scenes? So many! The first look at Diagon Alley, Harry's ""Yer a wizard, Harry"" moment, the Quidditch match, and, of course, the chess game. Every part of this movie feels magical, and it's no surprise that it kicked off a global phenomenon.Even today, watching this movie feels like going back to simpler times-when all you wanted was your Hogwarts letter. For me, this isn't just a movie; it's a feeling. A perfect 10/10 for creating magic that never fades.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
starts off well but can't sustain itself,"I must admit right up front that I have never read the J.K. Rowling novel on which `Harry Potter: The Sorcerer's Stone' is based.  As a result, I come to the movie `cold' as it were, being neither a full-fledged aficionado nor an inveterate denigrator of this phenomenally popular book series that, in the past few years, has taken the literary world by storm.  Thus, I will not be able to say to what degree Chris Columbus' handsomely designed film adaptation does or does not do justice to its source.  All I can say is how the film struck someone like myself who comes to the material fresh and without expectations of any kind. Well, the verdict, I must say, is a decidedly mixed one, so please allow me to elaborate.Let me state, at the outset, that the movie starts off splendidly.   We are introduced to the infant Harry Potter as he is mysteriously dropped off one night at the home of his maternal aunt and uncle in suburban England.  We quickly move ahead in time to find Harry, now aged 11, living a sort of male Cinderella existence, mistreated and overlooked by both his surrogate parents and Harry's precocious, spoiled brat cousin, appropriately named Dudley.  In the early stretches, the film does a superb job subtly injecting the excitement of magic into a real world setting.  There is also quite a bit of wry humor as Harry begins to slowly awaken to the fact that he has these strange and inexplicable powers to manipulate the elements of his world to his own advantage.  The film retains its spirit of fun as Harry, led by the mysterious but lovably burly Gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid, journeys to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to learn the tools of the trade towards which his eccentric destiny is leading him (his parents were also witches, killed by the evil wizard, Voldemort, who obviously has designs on Potter himself).  The preparations for Harry's enrollment in school (i.e. purchasing a magic wand) and the attempt to find his way to this magic hidden land are executed with fine, deft strokes, and Columbus keeps the movie blithely bouncing along at just the right momentum and speed.  Harry's introduction to the school itself is well done as well, as he meets an assortment of colorful characters (both faculty members and schoolmates) and boggles at the amusement park-like atmosphere he finds there, with an imaginative surprise seemingly lurking around ever corner.Yet not too long after we hit the school, something seems to go out of `Harry Potter.'  Perhaps the anticipation raised by the first half of the film leads us to expect too much, but, if the truth be told, the storytellers don't seem to have thought much about what to do with Harry once they get him to his destination.   Though we like Potter's two chums, Ron and Hermione, and a number of the faculty members, the adventures Harry ends up encountering while at the school seem rather tame, bland and ordinary when you get right down to it.  The monsters the writers have dreamed up for him to conquer aren't particularly interesting or intriguing and the plotting itself lacks excitement and suspense.  In fact, structurally, the film seems more like a series of elaborate set pieces designed more to show off the special effects than to provide a unified narrative that builds and grows to a cumulative impact.  Even worse is that much of the ribald humor of the earlier part disappears as well.  Had more of that dry British wit we are treated to in the initial stages been carried all the way through the film, `Harry Potter' might not have come across as quite so flat and attenuated as it does.On the positive side, Daniel Radcliffe gives a superb performance as Harry, capturing the innate goodness, wide-eyed innocence, and no-nonsense practicality of the character he's been called upon to play.  He makes of Harry a very real, very recognizable and very likable young boy.  Radcliffe is more than matched in performance by Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Ron and Hermione, Harry's two finely drawn companions in adventure.  It's a pleasure, too, to see the wonderful Maggie Smith doing her Miss Jean Brodie bit again after all these years.  No one can convey the brittle starchiness of the English schoolmarm better than she.`Harry Potter' is also a beautiful looking film, thanks to outstanding cinematography, production design and art direction.So there you have it:  as I said earlier, a decidedly mixed bag of virtues and drawbacks.  Those already enamored of little Harry Potter will probably balk at my carping.  Those already driven mad by Potter-mania may think I am too indulgent in my overall assessment.   But for one who feels little personal stake in the Harry Potter deification/demonization battle, I must say that this is a pretty good film that, I suspect, could have been much better.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"The 'worst' of the series may be starting to show its age, but is still an effortlessly entertaining and enchanting experience.","'Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone (2001)' is starting to show its age in a few areas - though, the majority of special effects still hold up remarkably well. The young actors have certainly come a long way since this first outing, but this is still an entertaining and endearing experience that's as enchanting as it is exciting. It does a great job of setting up the vibrant 'wizarding world' of which we're all now so familiar, it has some fantastically interesting concepts and well-executed ideas and it is surprisingly funny at times, too. While it may now be perhaps the 'worst' in the series, aside from the 'Fantastic Beasts' spin-off stuff (which doesn't really count, of course), it is still a wonderfully charming and enjoyable ride that's better than most of today's blockbusters. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
It's harry potter,"I mean like it's literally Harry Potter.This is the movie I've seen the most and because of that I don't like it quite as much as when I was a kid, this one feels the most exposition and plot hole heavy but it's not bad either. It just doesn't appeal to me as much as the others. This is just one of them where I usually skip it over when I want to watch a Harry Potter movie. It's a fun kids movie, but the later ones are more fun as you get older. 5 in particular with the villain.Some of the CGI looks janky as hell, but some of it still looks good. seeing it around as someone older I don't know how I didn't see the painfully obviously villain twist as a kid.Looking forward to 3, 4 and 5 since those are my favourites apart from the finale.It's aight, sets up the series well but it does feel a bit bogged down to me.

Sets the mood for the better movies in the franchise but unlike most film series,"I remember watching this in the cinema when it was realised and walking out underwhelmed. Baring in mind lord of rings the fellowship of the ring came out one month later and is a far superior fantasy movie experience. Looking back in hindsight after re watching this film many years later I realised it does a fantastic job at world building and settings things up for the better darker sequels in the series. The main problem here is the young cast, it's not their fault especially Daniel Radcliffe his personality is more wooden than a log cabin he's young and it's his first film. Although their acting abilities improve over time they are mostly incredibly irritating here, what makes this film truly work is the incredible adult ensemble cast, which with the fantastic sets, costumes, special effects really makes this movie work. It's also a complete enigma that if I had to rate this and champer of secrets I would rate them the worst in the franchise. But by no means that makes them bad films they are just not as good as the later films which is a complete rarity in any movie franchise.Harry potter films are great and special because they get better with each instalment. With the latter films everything from the special effects to the young cast finding their acting chops not only improves on what has come before but adds great weight in telling one of the best fantasy stories of all time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Star rating: 4 out of 5,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (bizarrely the Philosopher has transfigured himself into a Sorcerer in the USA) is a children's movie with a difference.  Thanks to the creative genius of J. K. Rowling, the judicious use of some excellent British actors, and an enormous budget, this is a film that treats its young viewers with respect.  Instead of the usual schmaltzy children's fare, Harry Potter (notwithstanding a few minor aberrations) thankfully doesn't descend into the saccharine.  On the contrary, it is a highly original and very entertaining trip into the hitherto infrequently visited realm of magic.To the many readers of the Harry Potter series of novels, the storyline will come as no surprise and the movie is very faithful to the book.  Despite prior knowledge of the plot nullifying the film's suspense somewhat, the mise-en-scene created is a veritable visual feast. The extensive use of computer animation is largely superb - the first trip across the lake to Hogwarts is awe-inspiring, Quidditch is excitingly brought to life, and the three-headed dog is certainly as scary as Rowling could have wished - although there are occasional clunky effects, such as the entrance to Diagon Alley.  The makeup too is outstanding, as evidenced by the alarmingly real goblin bankers at Gringotts.Despite the movie's 2 ½ hour length, it is relatively pacy as it follows Harry's discovery of the magician within himself, and his deadly duel with the greatest dark wizard of all time.  Together with the help of his friends Ron and Hermione he battles mountain trolls, bewitched broomsticks, and a brutal but visually stunning game of wizard's chess.  After all this excitement, the final showdown with the evil Voldemort is almost anti-climactic.  Nevertheless, overall this is a spellbinding movie - in more ways than one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
An amazing start to an amazing franchise!,"I love the Harry Potter books so much! And the movies are absolutely fantastic! They're some of my favorite movies of all time! And Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone starts off the film franchise incredibly.While this film isn't by any means the best in the franchise, it deserves some extra points because it had the heavy burden of establishing the world and the characters, and bringing everything from the page to the big screen for the first time.They did really manage to stay true to the books, perhaps more than all of the rest of the films. Naturally, there were some things left out, but that's understandable considering that a movie has different limitations compared to a book.The cast is incredible. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint all manage to effortlessly sell the relationships between Harry, Ron, and Hermione. And all of the veteran actors each bring something special to the professors they portray.Although the story isn't as exciting as that of the other films in the franchise, it's still an entertaining whodunnit that keeps you glued to the screen the entire time. It follows young Harry Potter (Radcliffe) who discovers he is a wizard and is whisked away from his abusive aunt and uncle, (Richard Griffiths and Fiona Shaw) and enters a fantastical world of magic and wonder, where he is famous for somehow defeating the Dark Lord Voldemort when he was only a baby. But he, alongside fellow Hogwarts students Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, (Grint and Watson) discover that the mythical Sorcerer's Stone is being hidden at Hogwarts, and one of their professors wants to steal it. The twist at the end is probably one of the best in the franchise, because there are clues sprinkled throughout, and it's so satisfying when they all come together.One thing that does hold this film back a bit is the VFX. Although many of them are very good, others are obviously just that. Special effects. And they are all a bit lackluster compared to later films in the franchise.Overall, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is an enjoyable watch, and it fabulously sets up the adventures of the boy wizard we all love so much.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Surprised by the darkness,"When I read the first book, I found myself disturbed by it; beneath the surface humor and the compelling fantasy world, there was a darker edge. I found myself unable to read more. I went to see the movie, expecting to find the dark edge gone, reduced to light and enjoyable kids' fare; I wanted to discover that the edge was only in my own mind. Instead, I was surprised to see these kids bleeding and being hacked at by magicked stones with swords. The dark edge I had felt in the books was magnified on the screen, not diminished. The flying keys being rammed into the closed door was a shock for me--these little kids are messing about with rampant and powerful evil. The defenses around the stone were meant to be strong, and they were supposedly cast by ""good"" people, but they were intended very seriously to kill indiscriminately--how ""good"" is that? I felt that the explanation of Harry's survival as having ""skin covered with love"" fell a bit flat for me, and the physical abuse in the opening sequence was accompanied by Exorcist-type supernatural disturbances (I found myself almost feeling bad for the Dursleys, being attacked by all that mail! Almost--but not quite.) Perhaps if this film was aimed at the 16-26 demographic and was billed as a film with a dark edge to it, I would not have been surprised by the presence of darkness. However, as a children's movie, I found it seriously lacking.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Hype above substance,"I've read the first Harry Potter book and I greatly enjoyed it.  (As an aside I'm also a conservative fundamentalist Christian who does not think that Harry Potter is recruiting tool for Satan).However, I was greatly disappointed with this film.  With an hour to go I was looking at my watch and hoping it would end soon.  The pacing was terrible and for long stretches I was very bored.  Visually I felt it was excellent but the screenplay adaptation was poorly done and at times the acting was abisimal.The book is far, far better and I doubt I'll bother with any future films. For a long book adapted right try ""Fellowship of the Ring"", a longer film that did not drag and handled the ""premise building"" necessary in the first film of a book adaptation series much better.The next films better be much better if its going to go the distance....If this series goes to 7 films I'll eat a golden snitch.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

The Perfect First Movie,"This is the perfect first installment to kick off a beloved franchise and I genuinely don't think there is a single thing about it that I would change. Bringing to life an entire magical world isn't easy, but an enormous amount of the production design seems to be ripped straight off the page of the books onto the screen. Most notable to me: Diagon Alley, the life-size chess board, Hagrid's Hut, and both the outside and inside Hogwarts castle, especially the Great Hall.So much of the film's warmth, youth, and feeling of nostalgia come from the warm color palette and timeless prop design void of any indicators of the modern era. Almost all of the light inside the castle comes from afire sconces and candles rather than lightbulbs- completely pulling the audience into a world that is advanced and magical, yet has no equivalent to things like digital clocks, televisions, or telephones.The wardrobe department on Sorcerer's Stone made seamless and brilliant choices in how they dressed both the children and adults. Teachers like Professor McGonagall, Severus Snape, and Albus Dumbledore stick out as the finest choices to me personally as their attire wouldn't be found in the real world- also known as the ""Muggle world""- and feels as magical as it does ancient. It cements the magical world as a completely separate society that doesn't exist interchangeably with non-magic folk; a decision that perfectly sets up plots for future movies that unfortunately ended up being foiled by future directors.Contrary to the books, the children on screen are dressed in school uniforms and making this change I think was one of the most brilliant diversions because it created iconic, recognizable, and recreatable looks that are still common cosplay and halloween costumes twenty-five years later. The uniforms also create an onscreen harmony between all of the characters dressed in a monochromatic style (with Hogwarts House determined accents of color) and the neutral tones of the ancient castle sets to create a dark/warm academia style that is immediately discernible.Casting so many young children with the intention of making seven movies with the same cast is a daunting task because it's so difficult to tell how they will all grow into their parts and into the industry, but this team absolutely knocked it out of the park. While very new to being on screen, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint all fell into their roles fairly gracefully. Occasionally, Radcliffe's performance can be slightly stiff, but carries the film remarkably well for an eleven-year-old actor on his second ever project.The special effects are wonderful, especially considering the time period it was made in, and only look a little unrealistic now that there are phenomenal CGI feats to compare to. None of the green screen slight blending slips in the Quidditch scenes or the introduction to Diagon Alley are distracting to the overall project nor do they look too technical to be believably performed magic.This will always be one of my favorite films of the franchise because of how expertly Chris Columbus took care of every element of this book. I can think of no better way to open Harry Potter as a saga and I will always be so grateful that someone so talented and passionate started the series because it allowed the rest of the movies to fall in line; we certainly wouldn't have had all eight movies if the beginning hadn't been this strong.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Oh Why Are We Cursed With Harry Potter in This World?,"Excessive and nearly completely tedious first installment in the sure-to-be long running series. The famous books come to life on the silver screen with ""Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone"". Young Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is recruited to Hogwart's School to learn the arts of being a wizard. He immediately makes friends in Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, but nothing seems quite right. The titled stone, guarded by a three-headed dog, appears to be the target of one of the faculty members at the academy. It must be shady professor Alan Rickman, right? Chicago critic Richard Roeper called this ""The Wizard of Oz"" of this film-going generation, but really come on. This movie is not in the galaxy of films as the aforementioned production. Early success here gives way to a nearly unending running time and special effects that could tire more than interest. Rickman, along with legitimate performers like Maggie Smith, John Cleese, Warwick Davis, John Hurt and Richard Harris get shoved aside by ugly visual effects and the film's three adolescent leads (behaving like mischievous brats throughout). Director Chris Columbus (a film-maker that somehow continues to work on big budget junk) continues to show shortcomings and I think the scope of the book and the film are just way too much for him and the performers. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

They all enjoyed the film, but had different opinions.  The 17-year-old thought it was missing something and hoped that people would read the books before seeing the film.  Her creative vision differed from Columbus.  The 7-year-old was glued to the screen and didn't utter a word, the 44-year-old was enjoying watching the girls react and found it amusing.

Harry Potter lacks magic,"Having never read any of J.K. Rowling's work, I was quite curious to see if the reasons for her recent publishing phenomenon would be apparent from the film adaptation. Unfortunately the answer is a resounding 'no'.The story combines two main themes, public school and wizardry, both of which are dealt with in somewhat traditional fashion. In fact the portrayal of Harry's schooling is very typically British and covers the usual ground - school traditions and rituals, house rivalries, etc. Rowling's approach to witchcraft is similarly conventional and will be familiar to viewers of all ages, i.e. wands, broomsticks, and bubbling potions.If the appeal of the book has more to do with the style of writing than the plot and subject matter, then again there was little sign of this in the big screen version. The direction and editing are best described as solid and competent, rather than refreshing or inventive, happy to tread cautiously in preference to taking risks.As for the acting, I was again left unmoved. In recent years we have been treated to some sparkling performances from young leads (Sixth Sense and Billy Elliott immediately spring to mind), but unfortunately the portrayal of Harry was uninspired and rather wooden at times. The rest of the cast where OK, yet I did not feel that anyone stood out in particular.These criticisms aside, the film does contain many elements which will appeal to children. There is plenty of good old fashioned action sequences, childhood rivalries, the first awakenings of young love, and a healthy dose of humour. Although there are some moments of tension and suspense, the general feel of the move is quite light-hearted and doesn't take itself too seriously.All in all its a well made, run of the mill, children's adventure yarn, which should provide decent entertainment for all the family. However a classic it isn't. It lacks the freshness and originality of Toy Story or Shrek, whilst falling well short of The Fellowship of the Ring in terms of visual impact. Since J.K. Rowling was in close contact with the production team I wonder how closely the end product matches her vision?",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

There is some pretty scary scenes including the death of a unicorn as well as a pretty graphic death scene of one of the characters.I can re-watch all of the Harry Potter films over and over again from 1 to 8 any time.

Also worthy of mention are Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Robbie Coltrane.

6.3/10,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone holds a special place for many, especially with its nostalgic appeal, but on its own, it's far from cinematic gold. The film serves its purpose well, aimed primarily at children, but it doesn't quite hit the heights of its later entries in the series. The whimsical world of wizards and magic is charming, yet much of it feels somewhat superficial, especially when compared to the more developed storytelling and world-building in subsequent films. Which, fair enough, it's children's movie.While the film does capture that childhood wonder, there's a noticeable gap in its emotional and narrative depth. The build-up to the final confrontation is drawn out, leading to a somewhat underwhelming climax. I'm aware that the brief and somewhat aborted ending is intentional, setting the stage for later developments in the series, but as a standalone experience, it feels like a missed opportunity. The pacing could have been tighter, as the drawn-out moments take away from the impact of the finale.One aspect that stood out as disappointing upon rewatching was the overacting, particularly from the Dursleys. Their exaggerated, almost cartoonish portrayal of disdain for Harry feels jarring compared to the more nuanced characterisation I remember from other actors in the film. The clash between the seriousness in acting, especially with the professors, and the Dursleys is apparent. In the later movies, there's a sense of logic and consistency behind the characters, even in their dislike for Harry, but here it feels more like a forced caricature. The lack of subtlety in their performances detracts from the overall realism and tone, which, in hindsight, is a noticeable shift from the more grounded approach that the series eventually adopts. I know it's not fair of me to be criticising a children's film about wizards in its logic, however I do think this could have been done better.The visuals, while nostalgic, seem less impressive than I remember. Perhaps it's the passage of time, but the special effects feel dated, and the magical world that once seemed so enchanting now falls flat in comparison to the more polished visuals of later films in the series. A lot about the plot, too, doesn't hold up quite as well as it did during my childhood, where the appeal was stronger.In the end, The Sorcerer's Stone is still a good film, but it's one of the lesser entries in the Harry Potter series. It's clearly targeted more at younger audiences, and while it does have its moments of charm, it's not as engaging for someone out of that demographic. As an introduction to the world of Harry Potter, it does its job, but it's far from the franchise's best work.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Best film ever,"Thank you --- i'm Ravenclaw by the way.As a proud Ravenclaw, I can say that Harry Potter offers so much for those who value wit, wisdom, and curiosity. Though our house doesn't get as much spotlight as Gryffindor or Slytherin, the story of Harry Potter is still a treasure trove for Ravenclaws who love unraveling mysteries and diving deep into magical knowledge.Rowena Ravenclaw once said, ""Wit beyond measure is man's greatest treasure,"" and that's how I approached the series. Hogwarts is a haven of learning, with the castle's vast libraries, secret rooms, and enchanted artifacts practically begging to be discovered. Ravenclaws thrive in this setting! The magical classes, from Transfiguration to Charms, are where we see some of the most brilliant characters shine-even though we, unfortunately, don't get as much of Luna Lovegood's brilliance as we deserve!Luna, with her whimsical insight and unique view of the world, is a true Ravenclaw at heart. She embodies the spirit of looking beyond the obvious, questioning reality, and embracing the unknown. Her role in Dumbledore's Army showed that Ravenclaws can be brave and daring, but in our own thoughtful, unconventional way.The series itself is filled with puzzles and clues, from The Philosopher's Stone to the Horcruxes, making it a playground for Ravenclaws who love to piece things together. We may not be in the heat of battle as much as Gryffindors, but our strengths lie in strategy, knowledge, and discovery.In many ways, Harry Potter is a story of balance-bravery, ambition, loyalty, and wisdom. Though I wish Ravenclaw House had been featured more prominently, the moments we do get remind us that intelligence and creativity are powerful forces in the wizarding world.For a Ravenclaw, Harry Potter is more than a series of magical battles; it's a journey into the mind, a celebration of curiosity, and a reminder that sometimes, the quietest discoveries hold the most power.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

There were still quite a few parts in the movie where I winced at how stupid it was and gritted my teeth waiting for the pain to stop but after it was all over looking back at it I can say it's certainly a great movie to take your kids to, but if you're looking for anything serious or you cherish a thought provoking script you better look elsewhere.

"A Cheery, if Inconsequential, Foray That Merely Scratches the Surface of Harry's World","Undoubtedly targeted at a very young audience, there's a certain degree of magic dancing around this picture that makes it easily-accessible to adults as well. Although my own childhood was long gone by the time this hit theaters, watching it today was like leaping back through time to an age filled with innocence and wonder. That effect does occasionally get lathered on a bit thick, but a speedy pace and densely populated realm are usually enough to compensate for such moments. JK Rowling's rich, sprawling, imaginative world is downright hypnotizing on the screen, loaded with treats and treasures, and it's tough to look away for even an instant. Although the CGI work is distractingly bad in a few instances (it very nearly ruins the Quidditch match), the child actors are average at best and there isn't much adversity to our heroes' hunt for the MacGuffin Stone, it's still a cheery, entertaining introduction to a universe that's positively buzzing with potential.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

"A faithful adaptation, but quite possibly the worst MOVIE I have ever seen.","I am an unrepentant Harry Potter fan.  I adore the books.  I thought I was going to have the holiday season of a lifetime, with Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings both coming out within a month of each other.At least there's still Lord of the Rings to salvage the season.Harry Potter was, in fact, very faithful to the words of the book.  The feeling, however, that one gets in reading Rowling was completely gone.  I didn't care about the characters as much, as Columbus didn't feel any need to tell us anything about them beyond the action on the screen; I didn't have any sense of anticipation, except in one scene in the forest (despite the fact that I have that sense each time I read the books); and I wasn't able to get involved in the story because the cuts from scene to scene were so abrupt (and often non-sensical).The effects were worse than the plot.  The troll looked like something by Pixar (Pixar is great, mind you, but it's animation and not realistic). Quidditch looked like a contest to see who could be the blurriest. Harry's much-touted digitally green eyes were only green in a couple of very brief shots.  My own model train set in my living room looks better than the Hogwarts Express.  I could go on, but I don't have the space to list all the problems.My suggestions for the next movie are that the script writer try reading not Rowling's WORDS, but the EMOTIONS she evokes, and that they not rush the production so much that the effects and editing suffer.  I really think that if they hadn't rushed to get this movie done in a year, the effects at least would have been vastly better.The only saving grace in this movie is Williams' score.  It at least lends a little bit of emotion to an otherwise flat movie.My recommendation: buy the soundtrack, and wait for the video.  Don't waste your money in the theatre.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

This is the beginning of a magical journey that used to fascinate us in childhood with its magic and mystery.,"This movie has everything you need for a fairy tale: the discovery of a new world, exciting adventures, new friends and enemies. When I was a kid, this movie seemed like a real miracle - every scene, every spell, and every moment from Hogwarts seemed to have something magical and unforgettable. Over time, perhaps some of the details seem simpler and the events less dynamic. But it was this first part that created the basis for the entire series, conveyed a sense of the new and unknown. The magical world that opens up with Harry still gives a pleasant nostalgia and remains one of the strongest parts of the series, even if it no longer impresses as much as it did in childhood.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Welcome to the world of Harry Potter,"Rating-7/10Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone is the starting movie in one huge and magical film franchise based on the books of the same name. This film for me was good, not great I must add but one movie that truly shows us something new and makes people just generally happy afterwards. It isn't awesome by any stretch of the imagination and I'll go into that later on but this does at least set a bench mark in film, one that started one of the biggest film franchises of all time.The movie is a nice mix between a kind of light and lovely kind of thing, but then dark and oddly scary in certain ways. The movie is for the most part heart-warming and gives you a beautiful sense of ""I'm there"" kind of feeling and one which instantly connects you with the characters. The plot can have it's more terrifying moments and especially maybe for the young viewers, a certain scene including the Forbidden Forest comes to mind on that one.Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are not great as our main heroes but they're not bad either actually, they don't really know how to act just yet but they still regain that nice sweet feeling about them which is all that counts here. The whole cast is a plethora of greats, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Richard Harris and many others contribute to the great cast who just make this film really what it is and make it all importantly, fun.It's possible as they say, that Christopher Columbus the director stuck too close to the books here and really should have deviated from the scenes which well, only work in the book. I applaud him for staying true but I have to say the film is over long and stuffed full of long periods where very little happens and that can at times make this seem slightly dull. I do like Columbus here though, I think he directs well and Steve Kloves adapts the screenplay pretty well too, yet again good all round.Now one thing that may not be most remembered but for me should are the special effects which for the day are really great and make this so much more exciting at times. Certain scenes just wouldn't work without them being good and the team behind it seem to create a visually good looking film too. Staying on the way this looks the sets are magnificent and truly incredibly done, on such a large scale it is difficult but they pull it off and first time as well.I felt this film is like an epic that is both for adults and kids and that is for me what sets this apart from other such movies in the fantasy genre. It shouldn't leave anyone feeling negative afterwards and really makes you kind happy in a way that leaves you positive about the whole movie and is another reason this is so memorable. It's hard to not fall in love with the Harry Potter world, the film not so much but the thing it is set in, very much so.Overall a good movie and also one that kick-starts a huge franchise of films that are so remembered and will be for me, in years to come. It's the kind of movie that isn't great but is still a classic in senses, so many people around the world can quote it and words and phrases from this movie continue to be used in everyday speech, just magically wonderful.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Great first entry to the wizarding world,"""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" was directed by Chris Columbus and introduces Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Rubert Grint as Ron Weasley and Emma Watson as Hermione Granger. It is the first movie in the franchise, therefore it has to dedicate a lot of its run time to building up the Harry Potter universe and the wizarding school of Hogwarts.Columbus directed this movie beautifully, however especially the costumes, the production design of both Diagon Alley and Hogwarts and of course the enchanting score by John Williams are timeless. In addition, compared to some dated visual effects during the quidditch match, the practical effects are hand-made and therefore still look really good.Every time I re-visit the world of Harry Potter I am immediately met with 90 minutes of amazement as something magical unfolds in front of my eyes. On rewatch this can feel a little long and time consuming, however what I dislike most about this first instalment is actually the last 30 minutes.

"Worth watching, but certainly not a masterwork","Now I am wondering why Rowling and the other You-know-what-director did not come to agreement and the job went to Columbus.What I liked: the setting and decorations. The best thing is that they had actors speak with an English accent, creates nice impression.The worse side is that the film is done for children with an excessive childish attitude.It had an impression that the film is cut in pieces. Apparently they tried to fit the book in 2 hours.It's not clear was it intended or not, but some parts look too pathetic, while the others are not well punched. Some dialogs are pompous and while those that should be are not. It lacks some dynamics as well, I did not have a feeling that things flow dense, but the whole year passed.Acting could be better, too. The Ron's part looks most natural, as for the rest.. could be more vivid. If  the stick to the book, which is what they did, the should be more passion and emotions in most parts.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Philosopher's Stone brings Imagination to life,"Harry Potter would undoubtedly have been a classic solely in its book form, but, thanks to the cast and crew of the film adaptations, the series has become a phenomenon. From detail-attentive storytelling to character castings that feel like the creators performed real magic to pull them from the pages, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone smartly uses its beefy runtime to tell an unmissable coming-of-age fantasy.Distinct aesthetics create a strong, old-timey feel with John Williams' musical score complimenting with a special magic of its own. If there's any soundtrack that can transport millennials back to their younger, likely happier days, it's the haunting and epic magic Williams crafts for the film.The Philosopher's Stone is pure imagination brought to life, and I have to give credit to absolute standout performances by Robbie Coltrane, Emma Watson, and Alan Rickman. Adaptations rarely hit as hard as the Harry Potter ones do, but even fewer scar pop culture in a way that, even two decades later, newbies and fans alike can be ensouled by the magic here.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A Magical Beginning,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001) is a magical introduction to the world of J. K. Rowling's beloved series. Directed by Chris Columbus, the film captures the essence of the book's wonder and whimsy, transporting audiences to the wizarding world with its detailed set designs, enchanting visuals and memorable performances.The story follows 11-year-old Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), who discovers on his birthday that he is a wizard and is invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. At Hogwarts, Harry befriends Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and together, they uncover a mystery surrounding the Philosopher's Stone, an artefact that grants immortality. The film maintains a light, playful tone while slowly introducing darker, more mysterious elements that will define the series.Radcliffe's portrayal of Harry, though understated, carries the innocence and curiosity that define the character at this early stage. Watson and Grint provide perfect complements as the know-it-all Hermione and the loyal, often comic, Ron. Alan Rickman's Severus Snape stands out with his menacing, yet nuanced, performance.The special effects, though slightly dated by modern standards, were groundbreaking at the time, bringing creatures like Fluffy the three-headed dog, and the game of Quidditch, to life. The iconic score by John Williams adds a magical layer to the narrative, enhancing both the whimsical and suspenseful moments.Though faithful to the book, some fans may feel the film glosses over certain details to fit the runtime, but overall, it captures the heart of the story. It's a faithful adaptation that remains accessible to newcomers while satisfying fans of the original material.In conclusion, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a charming and nostalgic start to the Harry Potter saga. Its whimsical tone, engaging performances and immersive world-building lay the foundation for what would become a beloved film franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

I guess you can't satisfy everyone...,"Reading various viewer comments, it seems like everyone has different complaints about HP the movie. Some people complain that scene X, which was CRUCIAL, shouldn't have been cut. Others say that that same scene X was not relevant and thus rightfully excluded. Some people say it was too watered down and childish. Others say it was too scary and inappropriate for kids. Sheesh!All in all, I thought it was pretty good. Both my girlfriend, who hadn't read any of the books, and I, who read the first 2, enjoyed it.The only complaint that I would agree with is that the movie was slightly too long. At a hefty 152 minutes, I overheard several viewers afterwards who said that they fell asleep. Although I never fell asleep, I certainly became tired at moments.Fortunately, the mid-movie Quidditch match added a much needed jolt of electricity. Although the CGI occasionally was too apparent, all in all the Quidditch scene was exciting and engaging, achieving what Phantom Menace's ho-hum pod race could not.Acting overall was pretty good. Daniel Radcliffe as HP was adequate, but the real show stealers were Rupert Grint(Ron) as the goofy but loyal sidekick and Emma Watson(Hermione) as the perfectly charming, bookish snob. Even Tom Felton as the despicable Draco did a good job.I give Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone a solid IMDb 7.

It took Harry ages to go to the wizards' school, and the premonitions about his magical qualities could have been smeared less thickly.

The plot line of Harry's solving the mystery of the Philosopher's Stone (that's the REAL name of the thing--ask any alchemist) is emphasized to the detriment of the more subtle plot of Harry's struggle to achieve self-confidence and a feeling of belonging after his abusive upbringing with the Dursleys.For those who have already read the book, all of these gaps are filled in from their reading.  The result is that almost all enjoyed the film (although the book was better) except those few whose mental images were impaired or who couldn't understand that some things had to be left out if the film was to be a watchable length.Of those who watched the film without reading the book first, the missing plot points and character development either makes them wish they had read the book first, and to vow to remedy that defect without delay, or to sneer at these faults because they cannot be solved within the context of the film without radically deviating from the books themselves.  While it may in some cases be fair to say that a film should stand on its own, this one was never meant to do so.  It is an illustration to a novel.  It should be viewed on this level or not at all.The upshot is, if you plan to see this movie, READ THE BOOK FIRST!!!  You are much more likely to enjoy the film.  Also, do not be confused by the hype or spin-off merchandising.  The success of the Harry Potter novels is based exclusively on their merit as books and that success was well-established long before there was any hype or franchising.  Only those both ignorant and cynical would attribute the notoriety of the stories to hype or franchising.  Ask any kid who has read them.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Not as good as the book & with some serious problems,"O dear - disappointing. Best features of the film are Hagrid and Hermione: both outstanding. Not too good: Harry is 'flat' (lacking excitement and energy); the cupboard under the stairs looks far too nice (and so it loses the 'escape from reality to fantasy world' point); Hogwarts dining hall is so obviously Gloucester cathedral nave; most of the the humour has been lost; the owls lose their gorgeous imaginative character; the voices seemed dubbed in places; some scenes lacked any obvious point (e.g. the invisibility cloak in the library); the academic year was curtailed.

Wow!,"I really did not want to see this movie.  I hadn't read any of the books and all the hype surround Harry Potter was a big turnoff for me.  However, I'm very glad I got talked into seeing it.I loved almost everything about Harry Potter (some of the acting could have been better, but I don't think it detracted much from the finished product). The story was captivating and incredibly imaginative.  The costumes and set design were wonderful.  The special effects were extremely well done.  The actors that played Harry, Ron, and Hermione were adorable and looked like they were naturals for their parts.This movie captured my attention from the very beginning and held it until the closing credits.

"lots of fun, ignore nit-pickers...","I attended a press screening of HPATSS, a week before the general public, in a theatre full of other press and their families. As I left the theatre, I heard lots of rumblings. Mostly positive. Some of which annoyed me enough to write this now...Right off the bat, let me express that I'm angered that a movie was made in the first place. Finally kids and adults around the world were reading, loving reading, and using/rediscovering their imaginations. Now instead of picturing Hogwarts in their heads, we all see in our heads the same visualized Hogwarts, Harry, etc...  But a film was shot, and can't be ignored, so - that said, allow me to get to the film:I really enjoyed the movie. Easily one of the years best, and sure to be a classic (It's no Memento, but that's ok). As a former Nickelodeon employee, I felt it was my responsibility years ago to read what everyone in that demographic had already read - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I found the book to be incredible, and couldn't wait for the Chamber of Secrets. In any event, I'm a huge fan of the books, of which I've read all of them more than once. I figured if any one could find fault with a HP movie, it would be me. After all, I'm a a critical person, a film school graduate, and a huge Harry Potter fan. I can't find much fault in the movie though. The only critique I have for it is that it felt unbalanced.My real beef though is with the rumblings that the book is better. I'm constantly hearing it. Of course the books are better. I agree, full heartedly. The book(s) are great. Full of detail, fun, adventure. But comparing the two is unfair. A movie has a limited amount of time/space to tell it's tale. A book can always add a page, a scene, a detail. I must have heard ""they left the _________ scene out of the movie"" a dozen times. What an annoying criticism. If they shot every scene of the book, the movie would run 4 hours at least. Why is it so hard for us to just sit back and enjoy a really fun movie, without looking for fault? There's so much to be appreciated in the movie, and perhaps most importantly I think we can all appreciate that it's possible this movie will encourage more people to read the books, and just read in general.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Full of Sound and Fury, Signifying Nothing","Cut about an hour out of the middle of HARRY POTTER and you'll have a pretty decent little movie.  As is, it's a bloated mess.  There's no heart to this, no characterizations.  It's just a product reel for all the special effects companies that worked on it.Seeing actors of the caliber of Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane and Maggie Smith wading through this, I wondered what went through their minds while they were performing.  They have to eat and pay bills like the rest of us, but the last time I felt so sorry for actors was watching Dudley Moore in SANTA CLAUS.There's no need for viewers to feel any emotional reaction.  The goshawful musical score by John Williams telegraphs everything to us and makes sleeping during the dull parts nearly impossible.This made a bundle opening weekend and the studio has started work on the sequel.  I wonder if business will hold at the same rate as the opening. It's playing on three screens at our local theatre and we didn't have to wait at all for tickets to the 7 pm show tonight (Saturday) and there were plenty of seats empty.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Strong Start To The Series,"The Harry Potter film series is a series i have never seen and i broached this first film wondering what it would be like. Harry Potter and The Philosophers Stone was surprisingly enjoyable with special effects which still look fantastic 20 years on. The film can be enjoyed by children and adults alike as there are some genuinely dark moments in this. The back story around Harry Potter is good and although a lengthy running time the film flies by, never dragging. A host of British stars give good support to the child leads with Robbie Coltrane and Alan Rickman being particularly memorable.

thrilled,"Ok I won't pretend to be a great movie critic, cause lets face it is there one? But I will say this, Hollywood hasn't really impressed me much these past few years. I have been to the movies a total of 4 times in the past 4 years. Thats it. Its because nothing has seemed all that interesting, until Harry Potter came out. Now I have read all the books a few times, and thought the movie was just awsome. I went with a friend who had never read the books and she loved it too. Yes it left parts out, but this is the first book to cinema movie that I can say wasn't a letdown. I am anxiously awaiting the 5th book and second movie releases.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry Potter and the Philosphers stone,"I think Harry Potter and the Philosphers stone was a great movie. It might have missed a few things from the book but it was really good to see all the characters that we would see over the past years until the end of Harry Potter. I myself think that the movie needed a bit more things in it. Like Harry thinking all of it was a dream and how he thought that he didn't belong at Hogwarts and they also should have said more about Harry's scar and his eyes, due to the fact that J.K. Rowling has hinted that Harry's eyes might help him defeat Voldemort. But all in all it was a great movie and I say a job well done to Mr. Chris Columbus for giving us an excellent start to the Harry Potter movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
good but not that good,"This film was good but not that good. The reason i say this is because of the acting, what I mean is the acting is not very good. Also the score could have been better. Other then the acting and the score the film was pretty good.I would have to give this film a 7 out of 10 for lack of acting, but don't get me wrong I think all the actors in this movie are wonderful.

I don't know if it's because of the screenplay or the fact that the movie was probably nearly worn out.Would I recommend it?  Sure...but don't pay full theater price for it.

"It's good, but a little disappointing.","I'm gonna try to give an honest open-minded opinion on this. That I enjoyed it.
It does try to give a good opening and setting to the story, and give detailed guidance to the wizarding world of Harry Potter. Which didn't do a bad job! But did you REALLY have to give this poor script and basic backstory and plot? As I said they didn't do a bad job.... But the guidance and plot to this is just plain basic. I mean like really basic! it's literally blatant. Like this is the kind of guidance for a 10 year old watching this. Acting was good overall. (Not including Danial Radcliffe) A good insight to all the characters and their back-stories. (The main reason I liked this film.) Good affects. Good setting to the atmosphere of this fantasy Trilogy and good CGI (needed some improvement) and so on... My first review on this site. Good Film overall!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"The movie was great, but it didn't go indepth enough","I really liked Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, but I felt it lacked some of the essentials from the book. Like when Harry gets fitted with his robes, he meets a blonde haired boy (Draco Malfoy). This is important because the relationship between the two is vital to the Harry Potter series - it's when they first meet and its significant. Harry doesn't know what Draco's like at that time, it's only later that he really sees Draco for what he is. From that point on, Draco and his friends make it very hard for Harry and his friends. I was disappointed that they didn't show the duel between Draco and Harry. I also thought that at some points the movie went a little fast. It also seemed that some connections in the book were not properly done in the movie. For example, they should have shown the Dursleys before Harry was brought to live with them - it obvious that they don't want anything to do with magic and the first part of Chapter 1 shows this. Overall, the movie was well done but hopefully Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets will go a touch more indepth and better show important connections.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, directed by Chris Columbus, was a wonderful, wizardly time! Knowing Chris Columbus from Home Alone, I was a little skeptical going into this film, but he put his intuitive style all over it, shooting a real dazzling looking film.The overall concept of the film is outrageously original, filled with tremendous potential and heart, with many memorable scenes! The premise of the film is where the issues come in. The premise is fine, and good kickstart for this favorable series, but it wasn't focused, or fleshed out nearly enough; All the creative team cared about was setting up all this exposition. The exposition is fine to a certain extent, but when seventy percent of the film is exposition, with another fifteen percent being some fan service-filler scenes, it makes it hard to get invested into what's going on, at this point in time. If the creative team cut out most of their filler scenes, they could've tightened up the narrative more, while giving the film an easier run time to digest. The film had a pretty decent pace for more than sixty percent of the film, but the middle act became more of a slowburn pace, creating a few unnecessary plots, that just got left to hang and dry.I give so much credit to these casting directors, for casting this star-studded cast! With this film being filled with a lot of characters, the creative team did a good job of balancing everyone, crafting countless memorable character moments, while giving them some nice layers to start to develop. It's no secret to say that the three main wizards in, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint, are the selling point to this film! Almost automatically, they're given phenomenal chemistry, and banter to play around with. They have this pure motivation, that make them really investable, and easy to root for. Although some of the supporting characters can go underdeveloped, they were still a huge asset to the film, and they all came to play ball!The screenplay by Steve Kloves was pretty well written overall, besides some of the parts and characters that went underdeveloped. He adapted this nice mythical speech style, that worked really well with the setting and plot! The comedy was really well balanced, and interwoven into this, sometimes darker toned film. Steve Kloves worked really well with J.K. Rowling to craft this script, and they made more than a handful of memorable quotes, that will just stick aroun with you forever!The creative team created tremendous potential with a new world, that opens doors to endless opportunities! The production design looks absolutely beautiful! The creative team utilized so many great set pieces, while having so many great practical costumes and makeup to go along with this amazing world.It's understandable that the magic isn't all there yet, but I would've liked a little more, with some conflict, to give the film more risks. Columbus had the perfect opportunity to add a lot of stakes, because of the kids inexperience, but the creative team didn't quite jump on it. One of the bigger issues of the film, is the effects. They weren't terrible at the time, but they don't hold up that well, and the creative team carried themselves like they created seamless work.The score is one of the biggest success this film has. John Williams is a master composer, and he easily crafted one of the most known scores in cinema! The score adds so much depth and intensity to every scene that it's in!Overall, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone will always have a special place in my heart, but it has room for improvement.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
I outgrew this film and its source material when I was a fetus,"My sister, bless her heart, used to work in a bookstore, and brought the novel this turkey is based upon home one day. After everyone else in my family had read it, I decided to give it a go because I had little better to do at the time. I wound up throwing the book across the room in around thirty pages, feeling that not only had my intelligence been insulted, so too had the already-persecuted-enough faiths of Wicca and its pagan relatives.So when I was given the chance to see this film for free, as long as I delivered my considered opinion to the local distributor when it was all over, I knew I should have let someone else take the assignment. But I just couldn't let fate smack me in the face once without giving it a chance to even out the marks. I basically had a similar reaction to the film that I did to the book: I walked out on it in about thirty minutes. As for what I told the local distributor, it runs something along the lines of missing the book's feeble, so-obvious-it-will-make-you-shake-your-head-in-despair attempts at satire and not being all that well-acted to boot. It is nothing more than a 152-minute commercial for a bunch of merchandise that is basically useless and prone to falling apart, but it does have Harry's visage on it.Since this film has been released in Australia, there has been constant comparisons between it and the upcoming Lord Of The Rings adaptations. There is no comparison for the following reasons: LOTR treats its audiences with respect, LOTR treats the faiths, cultures, and peoples it takes a lot of its details from with respect, and LOTR is not aimed at the lowest possible common denominator. Now that I have that out of the way, I'll just sit back and bask in my superiority to HP fans until the local distributor gets around to releasing LOTR this boxing day. :P",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Magic!,"J. K. Rowling's ""Harry Potter"" novels have caught the imagination of the public like no other children's literature of recent years, not even Philip Pullman's ""His Dark Materials"". Rowling's stroke of genius was to combine two areas of children's fiction which are normally kept separate, the world of magic and witchcraft and the world of the boarding school. (The ""school story"", dating back at least to ""Tom Brown's Schooldays"" from the early Victorian period, has long been a prolific source of children's literature in Britain, if less so in other countries).The basic concept behind the stories is that, alongside the familiar everyday world, there exists a shadowy Wizarding World, all but invisible to ""muggles"" (those lacking in magical powers). The inhabitants of this world appear to be normal human beings, but possess magical abilities. Rowling's hero Harry Potter is an orphaned boy who lives in an ordinary suburban home with his unpleasant relatives, the Dursleys. Unknown to the Dursleys, Harry is secretly a wizard who has inherited magical powers from his late parents, and on his eleventh birthday he is offered a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a large Gothic building in the Scottish Highlands where all British witches and wizards are educated.This was the first in the series of Harry Potter films. Each of Rowling's books covers the events of a single year in Harry's career at Hogwarts, and the original plan was for a new Potter film to come out every year between 2001 and 2007. This schedule, however, proved too ambitious, possibly because Rowling had not actually finished writing all seven novels in 2001, and the series is not due to be completed until the release of the second part of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" in the summer of next year.""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" essentially serves as an introduction to the series; much of the first half is taken up with introducing us to Harry, his two close friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger and the various teachers, personalities and institutions which he comes across at Hogwarts. Even in the Wizarding World there are villains; indeed, like a number of other fantasy stories, like Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"", the Harry Potter series was conceived as an allegory of good and evil. Like ordinary humans, wizards have the knowledge of good and evil and the moral responsibility to choose between them. A number of wizards have gone over to the ""dark side"", most prominent among them the dreaded Lord Voldemort, who was responsible for the deaths of Harry's parents. The excitement really starts in the second half of the film when Harry and his friends learn of, and try to frustrate, an attempt by Voldemort to obtain the fabled Philosopher's Stone which would give him great power.One of Rowling's stipulations was that the entire cast should be British or Irish, so this is one of the rare films to be made by a major Hollywood studio (Warner Bros.) without a single American actor. It was, nevertheless, a big success in the United States, thus disproving two major cinematic myths, namely that all successful films need at least one big-name American star and that American audiences need subtitles to understand British English, especially when spoken with a regional accent, as it is here by several of the cast including Robbie Coltrane and Maggie Smith. In neither case is their accent their normal one; as in ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"" the Essex-born Smith plays a Scottish schoolmistress, whereas Coltrane, himself from Scotland, plays the school groundsman Rubeus Hagrid with a West Country accent. Nearly all the cast are good, but the most outstanding performances come from Alan Rickman as the melancholy, morally ambiguous teacher Severus Snape and from Richard Harris as the wise, kindly headmaster Albus Dumbledore. Dumbledore was to be Harris's last great role; he died shortly after finishing the second film in the series, ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"".The first two films, both directed by Chris Columbus, are, despite the perils which Harry and his friends have to face, generally lighter and more cheerful in tone than the later episodes in the franchise. ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" is an excellent introduction to the series, magical not only in its subject-matter but also in the atmosphere of joy and wonder which Columbus is able to conjure up. Particularly memorable sequences include the Quidditch match, the scenes set in the Great Hall of Hogwarts, lit by floating candles, and the life-size game of chess near the end. A magical piece of family entertainment. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Way to start the magic,"This is a movie that I can probably point out numerous flaws with, but it's the type of movie I don't want to because this movie is quite simply, magical, the young actors managed to do a pretty good job mostly because of Columbus' direction, also while Harry isn't that interesting of character he's a great surrogate for the audience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
From a cynical muggle...,"I walked into 'Harry Potter' with as open a mind I could possibly have. I was (and still am) quite cynical about the entire hype surrounding the world of 'Harry Potter' though to be fair, I have yet to read the books. However, thanks to this movie, I am now intent on exploring for myself the wonderful world of 'Harry Potter'.From an objective point of view, this film is pure fun and adventure. We are introduced to Harry as an abused young boy growing up with cruel foster parents and it is quite fun to see how he grows and develops into, well... need I say? Along the way, we are treated to various characters of the book, all of whom are portrayed with great enthusiasm by an awesome cast. I loved the gorgeous sets and the visual effects, while not brilliant, are well suited to the film. Kudos to Chris Columbus for having been able to orchestrate everything so well together.Whilst watching it, I was pulled right into the realm of Harry Potter and emerged as a sort of convert. I still remain a cynic about all the hype but I was impressed enough by the film to try the books. My only complaint with the film would be that it is a bit too long and the momentum is disrupted somewhat but it is a minor niggle that fails to tarnish a good film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Faithful adaptation of the book missing the 'Wow' factor,"Whilst I'd obviously heard of Harry Potter I only read the books a couple of weeks before the film and read them all in a week - not a good idea as you spot the 'formulaic' aspects.Unlike most films, the director knew before release he would have a smash box office film due to the immense fan base the character had from the books.  However because of this he also had to make sure he stuck to the book and I have to say he did, almost like glue.  And that, for me, was my main problem as there was no real ""Wow"" factor.  Whilst I was struck by the amazingly well constructed sets and the visualisations of the various locations in the book, I always knew what was going to happen next and because the main themes of the book were so closely followed, as was much of the dialogue, I never experienced the frisson of excitement you can get when you think ""what's going to happen next?"".This isn't to say I didn't enjoy it, I did very much.  The characters were faithful to the book as were the locations but as I said, that was the main problem - no Wow!.  I'm not really blaming the director for this, in my opinion he would have found it extremely hard to introduce any changes and in making a film that the book fans loved he achieved his aim.So whilst I would say that the film is technically excellent the lack of deviation in the story was both its strength and its weakness.[ I also thought that changing the title for US audiences from Philosopher to Sorcerer because 'they wouldn't know what a philosopher was'  was an insult to that audience.]",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Spell Binding, Not!","Having known little of the Harry Potter novels I found myself approaching this film as a novice.  After watching it I can say I dont relish seeing any more.The film itself stands very well.  It has excellent music from John Williams, the speacial effects are very good and even some of the actors bring life to their characters.  Robbie Coltrane deserves a mention as he is the only person in the film who gives us any humour.  TWhat lets the film down though is that the passage of time is not very clear.  By the end of the film I found myself wondering how they were leaving Hogwarts after only a few hours?  On a second viewing I realised the passage of time is noted by the seasons.  Also the story itself is not very original.  Pretty standard fare plot wise.

Surprisingly good.,"One of the better childrens movies I have seen, especially since I found the books themselves about as deep as a comic book. Indeed one parent commented to me that it took her child more time to watch the film then to read the book. The sparse and simple dialogue of the books translates well into a script but the real strength of this movie is special effects to rival a Spielberg film and three excellent child actors. I could not however recommend to an adult to run out and spend their 12 dollars on this unless they are bringing a child. This is a detuned Indiana Jones for 10 year olds rather than a film like Shrek that works on two levels. Not really suitable for younger children.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Harry Potter's Big-Screen Debut,"J.K. Rowling's phenomenally successful character's big screen debut sees Harry enter Hogwart's school of magic and meet friends and foes who will follow him throughout his quest.Nobody's idea of a visionary director, Chris Columbus landed the delicate task of setting the foundations for what Harry Potter and his world would look like on the screen. As such, the first Potter film is all bright colors and an earnest desire to be faithful to Rowling's written words. Despite Columbus's unimaginative translation, it is amazing how well Rowling's universe suits the screen, with dazzlingly visual inventions like the great hall, pivoting stair-cases and the quidditch match.The story breezes past and the young actors deliver embody their characters with satisfactory conviction, no more, no less. Daniel Radcliff (Harry) and Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) are the fortunate standouts. Overall, the film bodes well for the rest of the series.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Great job at adapting a great book,"This movie is simply magical, and I think that, along with introducing you to the wizarding world, is the entire point. Their are so many details that enrich the story, which can be found in the costumes, props, and the magnificent sets. Also, Chris Columbus does a fine job at directing--several sequences were really well done, and you can tell he's good at working with the younger actors.Almost everybody by now knows Harry Potter's story, and although this does waver from the book a little bit, it covers all the important things, and does a fantastic job at introducing us to all the characters, who are brilliantly acted. Everybody from Maggie Smith to Robbie Coltrane to David Bradley does a fine job, and on top of that, the casting was superb, especially with the choice of Alan Rickman.Of the three younger actors, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, oddly enough, stand out above Daniel Radcliffe, with Emma doing just slightly a better job than Rupert. She gives such an attitude to Hermione that I think was really important to carry over from the book, and Rupert has great comic timing that really shines. Daniel, however, is just alright. At times he's wonderful, but other times he's a bit stiff and robotic in how he speaks, which is understandable considering his age at the time.Overall, this is a fantastic start of what turned into a fantastic franchise.

Very entertaining!,"I used to, in fact I still do, love fantasy films for example Labyrinth, Masters of the universe, Princess bride and of course the first three star wars films. Fantasy films have the most imaginative of set designs and costumes and when done well take you to another world for 90 or so minutes. Since the 80's these films have dried up, very rarely are they released and even rarer now are they good. The last I can remember was Phantom Menace but that wasn't great, plus there is an overuse of effects to, I like to see an actor walking on a set for real. All of a sudden Harry Potter comes out which will be quickly followed by Lord of the rings. I went not knowing what to expect, I had heard 99% excellent reviews, but would this sort of film still appeal to me? answer yes. This film gets the balance between kids fun and subtley included adult jokes perfectly, it has moments of universal joy and the set designs are brilliant as are the effects, the effects thankfully are not overused either. Most films of this type would have an adult in the lead for the purpose really of experienced acting skills despite a child being more accessible for the younger audience, but thankfully the three principle child actors are good in their roles, the supporting cast of the younger generation range from average to quite wooden but they will get better with age. As a critic said the three main kids are not portrayed as to cutsie like the case might have been, aside from their magical skills they are seemingly you average run of the mill kids you see every day in the highstreet or whatever. Basically this film has a universal appeal and I would say is the first decent non cartoon fantasy of the 90's. Its solid entertainment. ***",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Overall a fine expirience.,"I decided to do a check-up on Harry Potter's famous adventure made for the big screen, so I started reading the books yet again, because I know that changes have been made to make it fit for a visual medium. I knew I would prefer the book, because I'll admit that some scenes that were cut didn't make sense to me.But I could go on talking only about that, so therefore I'll bring up the good stuff.The music was beautiful and really captured the sense of wonder when all the magical elements were presented. And the Hogwarts castle was stunning in its grandiosity and still struck me with awe and amazement. The broomstick flying hasn't aged too well as you can tell that they're not really flying when they come in for close-ups, but you can't really blame a movie for being made when it is and the Quidditch game still looked good and felt exciting.Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane as Professor Severus Snape and Hagrid respectively were well chosen for the roles and as far as I know, J.K. Rowling had a personal say in their assignments to the roles and it payed off in my opinion. Rickman's soft voice was just what I heard in my head when reading his lines in the books and Coltrane puts just as much likability into Hagrid as I remembered.Richard Harris and Maggie Smith as Dumbledore and Mcgonagall respectively also did well adding personality and face to those characters. And Rupert Grint stood out as a funny Ron Weasley among our main charcaters. As it is their first meeting with each other, they have to warm up to each other's company, so I Harry is mostly going around being all ""wow, it's amazing, I didn't know that"" but comes around and discovers thing he is not supposed to and getting into trouble as the movie goes on. Hermione is a know-it-all and Malfoy is an arrogant dick. It's a first movie in a coming-of-age story, so that is to be expected.But I was disappointed with one thing especially, just to round off the faithfulness to the book, because Hermione's character was surprisingly down-played in a couple of crucial areas making up her character growth in the book some of them also could have made a couple of exciting scenes. That made her a little more one-dimensional here, I'll admit.While some crucial scenes didn't make it, the movie is still good-looking and with some really good choises made for other characters. Add in some fantastic music and you have a fantasy film for the whole family.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Epic book, epic film","Rarely is book to screen done well. This is done SO well I think it's the first time the movie is actually pretty much what I had imagined while reading.

"Very Succesful attempt, Filled with Magical wonder","I should start by saying I am an absolute Harry Potter nut and so the film carried a huge weight of expectation.  It didn't disappoint.  The film includes stunning renderings of all the key scenes, wonderfully acted by an obviously caring and dedicated team.  The scenery and effects are stunning and fill you with a sense of wonder I haven't felt since I was a kid. Diagon alley, platform 9 3/4 and Hogwarts are all straight from J.K. Rowlings descriptions and were just how I pictured them.  The set pieces of the quiditch and chess match were fantastically exciting and added pace to a film that could have lagged (its 2 1/2 hours!).  The acting was uniformly superb.  Maggie Smith is brilliant as the strict yet caring McGonagal, Richard Harris adds the perfect sense of weght to Dumbledore and Snape is made suitably menacing without being camp by Alan Rickman.  The kids are brilliant, Rupert Grin and Emma Watson making Ron and Hermione their own, with only one line sounding corny from either.  Dan Radcliffe is good as Harry but would I feel have benefited from a bit of voice to camera naration to explain his feelings.  A mention should also go to Sean Biggerstaff as Oliver Wood, who is great when guiding Harry through quiditch and performing heroics in the Gryfindor goal.  Undoubtedly the star of the show though is Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid, he shows a full range of emotion from rage at the dursleys to caring ad sensitive with Harry.  He also gets the best comedic momments throughout the film.The film cuts out some of the ancillary bits from the book, the begging is truncated and some scenes which added context or insight are missing, but if you left them in it would have to be a mini series instead of a film. Nothing important is missed however and the film still conveys the magical wonder of the book.I loved this film, it had me cheering at the quiditch and crying at the end with the poignant momnts of interaction between characters.  The film is truly magical!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Watchable,"After all the expectations how great the movie would be and how much money it would produce (as if this is the most important thing about a movie) I was very disappointed. The plot has holes and the story line switches for no reason here and there. The characters are not convincing and the relations are almost non-existing. And it's boring quite a good deal of the time. But there are virtues too - very beautiful pictures, nice visual effects and interesting and original events. And I guess for kids it's fun from time to time. The acting is also good and the young people are really nice. But anyway this movie was far from being what it was supposed to be - one of the greatest fairy tales ever filmed.

That's what ""Harry Potter"" is - a land full of magical brilliance where you can let your mind wander - it's incredible. Now you wonder how a movie can live up to that?

However since the book was so longand packed with details, it is difficult to make all of the informationinto a reasonably short movie.  Therefore you are provided withone long 2 hour rising climax, until the very end when you aregiving a conclusion to all of the ideas presented throughout themovie.  In contrast, the book provides many scenes in which thereis a rising climax and then conclusions to those scenes.Therefore if you haven't read the book, then you will wonder whyyou are being presented so many different ideas throughout themovie.

Welcome to Hogwarts-part 1...,"Harry Potter and the Philospher's Stone (I prefer to use the original British title) is a wonderful experience: good script, great visuals, extraordinary actors... However, there's a ""but"", which is the following: it's excessively faithful to the source novel, leaving out only one or two side characters. The movie, which tells how a seemingly normal boy, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), discovers he is actually a wizard and starts attending a school named Hogwarts, encountering many dangers throughout his first year, isn't boring for a second during its 146 minutes, but the pace is occasionally slowed down because, like in other ""part 1 of 3"" movies (actually, they're supposed to be 7), the director spends a lot of time introducing and explaining things, so he won't have to do it in the sequel(s). In this case, Chris Columbus, best known for Home Alone includes as much as possible also to make sure the target audience (kids) will enjoy it, adult viewers being more used to differences between book and film (and thus perhaps likely to find the running time a bit excessive).Nonetheless,the movie is great, Columbus using all the tools at his disposal to bring J. K. Rowling's enchanted universe to the screen. And the magic is in every single frame: from potions to talking hats to Quidditch games, it's pretty clear nothing ordinary can possibly happen, and all of it looks real, thanks to brilliantly accomplished special effects and CGI. But the movie's strength doesn't lie only in the visual aspect: there's also an impressive ensemble cast, consisting of some of Britain's finest actors. All of them are impressive, but it si of course the adult section of the cast that pulls off a superior job, having more experience and knowing how to add substance to an array of fascinating characters (standouts include Robbie Coltrane as a gigantic caretaker, Alan Rickman as a sinister teacher and of course Richard Harris, who plays Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore with unmatched charm and warmth).Aside from a few ""slow"" bits, this is a good start for what will certainly be one of the defining franchises of the 21st century.To paraphrase Dumbledore: let the feast begin...",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Good family entertainment.,"I finally decided, after 24 years since this movie came out and builded a worldwide fanbase, to watch all the Harry Potter movies. Just to see if it was worth all that fuss. I'm 56 now, so not really part of the audience they aimed at, but in all fairness I enjoyed watching this kid adventure. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are all so young, quite strange to see them that young, and even if some of them made some good movies by now, it shows that they were debuting here. Not bad but a bit childish. You get that vibe in different scenes but the story is entertaining nonetheless.

The start of a great series,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the start of the Harry Potter movie series- which is an excellent series, by the way! This one starts Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, a young orphan boy, living with his grandparents. He discovers that he is a wizard, and is being sent to Hogwarts: School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. His grandparents are reluctant to send him, but luckily, Hagrid comes and takes Harry to his new school. Unfourtunatley, Voldemort (He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named) the man who killed Harry's parents is lurking about the school, searching for Harry.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone makes a solid fantasy movie, but it seems to have a few clichés. And, it seems to be pretty simple and undeserving of a higher, for an odd reason, I cannot think of at the moment. I guess it just seems to un-imaginative. Magic and fantasy creatures don't immediately make a movie look imaginative.Harry Potter is the start of a fantastic series, but easily the 'lightest.'

What A Let-Down.,"The buzz surrounding this movie was massive. The huge amount of A-List cameos was ever-growing. It was all so promising!

Emma Watson is the only half decent child actor here, yet compared to other child stars (Dakota Fanning, anyone?)she is rubbish. You actually see the 'trio' mouthing each other's lines along with each other. Heheh, quite funny really! The dialogue is laughable and all the darkness yet sly humour from the book is sucked out and replaced by cheap toilet humour.Admittedly, the films are getting better as each one goes by, but I just pray Goblet Of Fire is good.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the Best Book To Movie Adaptions I've Seen.,"I've waited a while to see Harry Potter.  I've read the books, loved the world, and admittedly, I've been a little hesitant as I've watched this great series overmarketed to the point where it's almost the next Pokemon.Fortunately, the movie retains the dignity of the book.I've seen a lot of mixed reaction to this film.  Some absolutely love it. Others think it slow-paced and incredibly dull.  I think the enjoyment of this film will be based on if you read the books or not.  I do think some of the terminology and ""understoods"" of the character motivations in the movie would be somewhat incomprehensible for someone not initiated with Potter's world.  Hopefully, this would prompt the uninitiated to read the books before they blast this movie or see the next one.  The source material is very accurate with only minor deviations.That aside, as someone who HAS read the book, I thought the film was quite simply delightful; a term that I normally don't use in describing a film. It adequately captures the moments that made the book so much fun to read. It captures all the details of the books, from Halloween to Christmas, the the ""Return of the Jedi""-esque (in speed and pacing at least) Quidditch match, and even the moments of Harry's wonder of his new world as well as his feelings of dealing with the truth of the loss of his parents.  What moments I feared would be lost in the translation were kept in there.  As for the cast themselves, the children playing Harry, Ron and Hermione were very likable and accurate to their book counterparts.  The same goes for the adults as well.True, like any book-based movie, there are changes.  The good news is that even if they moved a conversation or act, they normally made reference to it in some way rather than forgetting it.  The biggest omission I noticed was the removal of Peeves.  Hopefully, he'll make a return in the second film.Another thing people have criticized about this film is John Williams' score.  Yes, it does not have the impact of say Star Wars, E.T., Indiana Jones or Schindler's List, but it does add to the film and not ""overwhelm"" it ""sell the movie"" like a lot of people feel it does.  There's no one forcing hands or wallets to go buy the soundtrack.  Perhaps people wanted a soundtrack with Jessica Simpson or yet another film with Smashmouth's ""All-Star"" placed in it.As a fan, I had a good time with this film, and was glad to see that they kept the feel of the book as well as they did.  For a ""children's"" (I used the term loosely based off the number of adults who enjoy it as well) film, clocking in around 2 1/2 hours is a pretty long time to ask kids to sit through, but I think older kids will be able to.  Plus, there are a few scenes that may be a bit too intense for the little ones, such as dealing with Voldemort and Fluffy.I recommend this film.  It's easily one of the best I've seen for this year. I will, however, give this recommendation: If you don't know Harry Potter, I really suggest reading the book before or directly after seeing this film so you can make comparisons to it.  You'll find the two don't change that much from the other, and knowing the source material beforehand, while not mandatory, will certainly help make the experience that much more enjoyable. And if you don't want to read the books, ask someone close by.  You'll run across more people who know of it than don't.One can only wonder how long a film the phonebook-sized Book 4 will be....",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

The Potter movie that started it all.,"Disclaimer: I never grew up on the Harry Potter series nor have I read the books. So my review may be biased.This film is an introduction to the cultural phenomenon surrounding the Harry Potter universe. With book-to-movie adaptations, there are many things that can go astray. Yet Philosopher's Stone seems to capture the wonderment and childhood terror that makes the series a cross-generational classic.Also kudos to the actors. Radcliffe, Grint, Watson, et al. gave a stellar performance that charms audiences around the world.It's a charming firm, lighthearted, and whimsical. There's a ton of world-building that lets audiences' imaginations run wild. The film itself is an impressive watch. Even if the CGI seems a bit dated at some places... but is that a fair critique for a 19 y/o film?Personally, one complaint I had was how fast time seemed to move in this film. We move from month to month rather disorientingly. But you try compressing a school year in a single 2-hour movie.The other complaint was based on how things seemed to happen too perfectly for Harry.

"Pretty, plotfilled, but soulless...","Everyone's already said it: This is almost exactly the Harry Potter world from the book.  Almost perfectly rendered, characters spot on, even if Harry was a little wooden, and has most of the action from the book.Which is, of course, the problem.I saw this movie with a bunch of kids in the rows in front of and behind me. The younger ones fell asleep.  No surprise there.  The older ones watched it, marvelled at it, compared it to their imagined versions, and... almost fell asleep.There is a lot to cram in to this movie.  But curiously, rather than rating some plot points as more important, others as less, this version of Harry contains EVERYTHING.  All the major plot points are there, with a couple of stripped down exceptions.  Faithful to the story - yes.  Faithful to the spirit of the books - no.  And the kids around me said it.""Where were all the jokes, Dad?"" Asked one kid. ""Where was Lee Jordan's commentary of the quidditch,"" asked another. ""It didn't FEEL like fun,"" a third said as we walked out, probably the most telling comment of all.Rather than prioritising the plot points, we got the lot.  So the spirit of the books - the urgency, the glee, the fun, the joy - all disappeared.  We lost Harry's character... reduced to a quiet noone. - which is odd, coz all of the other characters were perfect! (Though Dumbledore needs a sense of humour, and the Wesley twins aren't ""bad"" enough""...)A functional rendering of the book, but as one person said as we walked out: ""Value for money wise - I'd rather spend $18.95 on the book than $10 on that movie"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
True Magic,"""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is a wonderful movie. This comes from a Harry Potter illiterate. The story and movie are very reminiscent of the Star Wars mythology. Orphan Harry has special gifts-- an undeveloped and natural power. He like Luke Skywalker is the chosen One. So he must be trained. In Harry's case this takes place at the Hogwart School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry is to become a great wizard, like Luke becomes a powerful Jedi. Along the way, we learn that there is a very powerful and seductive ""dark side"" to Magic. Ultimately the path is a choice or perhaps a sacrifice. Harry feels alone and incomplete-- he yearns for his dead parents. The whole scene with Harry sitting in front of the Mirror of Erised and speaking with Richard Harris as Dumbledore (Hogswart Headmaster) made it for me. Dumbledore says that men have gone mad looking into the Mirror living their dreams, ""...forgetting to live."" Great stuff. Looks like the other books may be darker as Harry seeks out the man responsible for murdering his parents. Also the message that true magic does not come from books, rather from friendship, bravery, and ultimately love is touching. The movie is a magical journey of a hero, Harry.The movie is stunning visually. The John William's music and sound set the right atmosphere. I gather that director Chris Columbus steered by the R.K. Rowling's book (from the Steven Kloves screenplay). To his credit he generates strong performances from his actors. Daniel Radcliffe (who looks like John Lennon as a boy) is perfect as Harry-- the lonely and courageous boy coming into his own, and finding and creating a family. Emma Watson as know-it-all, Hermione, all but steals the movie. Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley is charming and funny. Robbie Coltrane is great as the protector Hagrid. Alan Rickman is at his slippery evil best as Prof. Snape. An unusually restrained Richard Harris is excellent as the Headmaster Dumbledore, the powerful, wise, and whacky mentor. Maggie Smith as Headmistress McGonagall is great as the strict and compassionate professor. As one of my friends says-- ""Maggie Smith rocks!""""Harry Potter"" is total entertainment.

Philosophers*,"This was an incredibly valiant attempt to bring the books to the big screen, and in my opinion does so beautifully. The story is simply magical and ""Hogwarts"" is a genius invention.

My only complaints were the child actors, which is understandable and were still young and we now they develop into great actors later on. I think the film's quality doesn't really hold up anymore and the CGI and special effects doesn't really look great.

"The first 'Harry Potter' makes no mistakes - and takes no chances, and has no style","My summary might be a little harsh on what is, after all, a highly entertaining children's movie that's grossed hundreds of millions of dollars and, undoubtedly, still delights children that didn't exist in 2001 through DVD and Blu-Ray. But I stand by my statement - I liked it when I was 9, and I liked it last night, but 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' is paralyzed by its fear of alarming any part of its audience.The chief difference between this and later Potter films is in its tone. This movie replicates the dreaminess and whimsicality of the book, faithfully recreating even incidental magical scenery from the novel with painstaking care - however, it doesn't add any of its own. That, in microcosm, is the one thing wrong with the entire 146 minutes of film: the plot unfolds identically to the book's, the dialog is often taken verbatim from it, the world is designed as the most neutral and safe - SAFE, is the problem - version of the Potter universe one can imagine, and the overall effect is that of an illustrated audiobook. Director Chris Columbus takes absolutely no risks, a decision which only seems more foolish as the years go by and newer Potter films, like Alfonso Cuaron's excellent 'Prisoner of Azkaban', burst with imagination and creativity. While, like 'Star Wars' (but less so), 'Stone' does evoke a sense of wonder at the magical things in Harry's world (and, in case anyone misses the point, the movie's child actors exchange chuffed grins for about a third of the running time), the anxious restraint with which the whole deal is executed renders it rather leaden.Hence the comment about paralysis I started off with. It may be well made, but 'Stone' is - tragically, as it turns out, considering the quality of all the movie's other ingredients - uninspired. But it is rescued from a boring fate by the fact that it is, after all, telling a cracking good yarn. One that I (heretically) think is actually better for film than for a book, where the flimsiness of its plotting and lack of true literary spark makes it come off as a kind of Roald Dahl Lite. Add to this a stable of magnificent British actors who gleefully shed their layers of reverend good service in classics on stage and screen and dive totally into their spectacularly silly roles. The roll-call is phenomenal: Sir Richard Harris, Dame Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, John Hurt and others in smaller parts that pull them off with panache calculated to shade any flaws in the performances of the younger actors - who, by the way, are really quite good. They don't need to be brilliant, and they're good enough here as 11-year-old kids. Which is what they are.The story, anyone should know. Harry Potter is an orphan whose parents die in mysterious circumstances and who, at the age of 11, after a decade of living miserably with a cruel aunt and uncle, discovers that he is a wizard. He goes off to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he finds that he is not only a wizard, but a famous wizard: the only one ever to survive an attack by the now-vanquished Dark Lord, You-Know-Who. Dark Things are stirring at Hogwarts - there is a whisper in the Forbidden Forest, a teacher with suspicious designs, and something horrible lies under the trap door in the left third floor corridor . . . and above it.I quite enjoyed it actually. Shame it had to be so stuffy. Recommended.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Great but novel is unbeaten,"This movie was awesome but was disappointing to see some areas of the novel not in the film.

Not as good as the second one!,"Like most Harry Potter fans, I had read all four books before tackling the films. I had tackled the books by February last year and watched the films by August! My least favourite book is this one and the film didnt do it much justice, acting wise. The talents of Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman and Richard Harris delight the screen but the childrens' acting was a wee bit flat. Of course they can be let off because for some, it was their first ever on the acting floor.The only three kids I like in this one were the Weasley twins and Oliver Wood- they were a pure delight to see.Better comments on my review for the second one!",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
take this film for what it is,"This is a film that was made primarily for children and people should remember that, I think it is unfair to say that the acting is poor because I thought all the young actors did very well.

An Entertaining Beginning,"This is a fun, though flawed movie. I'm not a big fan of this franchise, but this is a pretty good movie.Characters - This is one of few movies that have good child actors. The characters themselves are also pretty well-written. I'm not saying I like all the characters, but they are well-written and portrayed.Plot - This story is full of holes and inconsistencies. Maybe some stuff is explained in the books, I haven't read then, but very little is explained in the movies. That's not to say that the movies aren't interesting, but if you are the type of person who likes it when there are established rules in movies, avoid this franchise.Sights and Sounds - This movie looks great. Yes, there are a lot of annoying inconsistencies between shots due to a lack of a continuity department, but overall the effects and cinematography are pretty good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A melding pot...,"Transferring book to film is always a tricky subject, especially so in this case with millions of children expectantly waiting to see what they'd imagined come to life on screen.Having never read any of the Harry Potter books I went in to see this movie without huge expectations. I wasn't disapointed with the end result, but it must be said that even at two and a half hours it still barely covers what the book must've done.Running length of the first cut was at the 4 and a half hour mark, so it would've been a huge task trimming down to under 3 hours. I felt as though this seems to show in the movie itself. Many characters are introduced yet never investigated, plot threads are given but never uncovered and as a whole it is disjointed and 'bitty'. Chris Columbus has not failed in the sense that the film has that magical fairytale feel to it and that care has been taken in keeping true to the books (to keep the kids happy!).On the whole a fun film, but in my opinion it has franchise written all over it.

Off to a Successful Start,"Rescued from the outrageous neglect of his aunt and uncle, a young boy with a great destiny proves his worth while attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.This is the film that started it all, and was, of course, a huge success. One might wonder what would happen if you had seven movies to make and the first one already flopped or was poorly done. But this did not happen. The crew was perfect, with a master of family films (Chris Columbus) at the helm. The casting could have been tricky, since they had to get children to act well on screen and then make sure they could keep them for a decade. Daniel Radcliffe proved to be perfect for the part, and Emma Watson does alright, too, despite overacting at times.The adult cast is fleshed out with plenty of solid choices, filling the void from serious, to silly to scary. Alan Rickman, who plays Snape, has a little bit of all three, and was really a crucial casting choice, and the costume department did their best to make him look like Trent Reznor. Perhaps they could have cast Reznor himself, but I suspect he does not have Rickman's range.Of all the films in the series, this is the lightest. There is a villain, but he plays a minor role. And there are some dangerous challenges, but overall the element of fun remains. These are 11-year old children, so there needs be no rush to push them into a world of life and death. And for those who have not read the books, this is our first time meeting everyone, so introductions and character development are important.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Sadly, it would never have worked","If you, like so many others, had high expectations for the movie because of how good the books were, then you would have walked away disappointed. A book as popular as Harry Potter could never have been done to appeal to all its fans because so many will pick out every little mistake in the film that doesn't coincide with the book.It was clearly difficult to compress the book into a movie-safe length and given that almost all who watch it will have read the books anyway, there wasn't too much left out. However, Daniel Radcliffe just doesn't work when playing Harry. Sure, he looks like him, but the way he speaks as if he's on his deathbed just isn't Harry. Likewise Emma Watson and Rupert Grint; their expression was far too over the top to seem real, despite the theme of the movie.The worst of it all is that the movie had too many clichés to really stand out from the rest of the pack. It just wasn't magical.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
No 'Wonder' with this Wizard...,"So there I was looking for another movie to take me to another world, to send shivers down my spine and thrill me to the edge of my seat - with high hopes that young Harry had the ability. Maybe at the ripe old age of thirty I've lost that sense of Wonder that Poppins and Wonka and Chitty gave me as a child but hell, a kid on a broomstick seems so passe these days. Flying nannies and cars and chocolate factory managers were amazing back then! Oh and there was no one as scary as the Childcatcher either.So close to the book that the film dismisses the staple 3 act blockbuster format for episodic content that leads to small climaxes and a poorly placed highlight - yes the Quidditch game is great... There's no real sense of urgency to each scene, so when the final battle comes it leaves a feeling of...well, not much at all really...There are some great set pieces (besides the Quidditch) and nice performances - notably the best child actor is Malfoy, snidey and annoying as he should be while Radcliffe as Harry is nothing more than O.K. The rest of the kids are cast well - though the Yorkshire nerd (who lives down the road from me apparently) left me cold. The adults are pulled from some great British actors holes and do a great job oh the whole, most playing roles that were written for them - Coltraine as Hagrid and Bates as Snape.Look, I enjoyed it - kids'll love it, but it's an empty sort of feeling the movie leaves you with and with such good source material that's, well, annoying. Hell, the movie seemed to insult the book by holding up the obvious reference points that Rowling went to when creating Harry and Hogwarts. There's so much Star Wars - 'come to the dark side Harry' - and more than enough Lord Of The Rings theft going on here.So as I left the cinema - I thought to myself, why was the most entertaining thing about the film the trailers that were shown before it? Hopefully Harry is just an apetiser for the main course of cinematic Wonder that's still to come...",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Faithful to the book, but missing something","For a book adaptation, ""Harry Potter and the Socerer's/Philosopher's  stone"" is a fairly good effort. It remains as faithful to the book as possible, and leaves out very little in term of story. Unfortunately, it DOES leave out most of the humour of the book (which was to be expected, you simply can't put all those funny descriptions in the movie), but it sadly doesn't replace them with much else.I agree with many people that the main problem with this movie is the direction. We all know and love the story, the acting is generally good, the special effects are adequate (some shots are really fake!) etc , but it all feels so very dry, the director didn't really add his own touch to the movie, like really good directors like Tim Burton or Steven Spielberg would do. Most of the famous actors are severely underused, too.Most of this of course doesn't really matter as kids will still love this movie, but as it is, ""Harry Potter"" is more like a ""painting by numbers""- exercise, while in the right hands it could have been a Picasso.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
7 Points for Gryffindor,"From the moment J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books were formed into movies for viewing on the big screen, we knew they would be a success across the globe - and so it proved.Christopher Columbus was the first of numerous directors to take the director's seat and cohesively bring together a film to do justice to Rowling's original novel.Back in the beginning, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) was destined to become the chosen one, the one to bring balance to magic. Living with his cruel and deceitful Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths), Harry jumps at the chance of leaving home to attend a school of magic with friendly messenger Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane). While swiftly making friends in the form of Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), he soon realises that villainous beings may be at work in the halls of Hogwarts - the school of magic.It's all rather exciting - even more so at the time of its release as it was the first 'Harry Potter' movie to be released.Certainly, not the best of the collection in my eyes anyway. The trio of Radcliffe, Grint and Watson are still finding their feet and maximum acting ability - the chemistry is still developing. Also, it feels more of an introductory movie more than anything else but when watching it over again, it brings back the sense of enjoyment and happiness of viewing its evolution once more.Concluding, I offer seven points to Gryffindor!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The one you can't really criticise because it started it all,"So it's the one that started it all - also known as ""the one you can't really criticise because it started it all"". In other words, it makes me feel awful to have to say something negative about what is a good start to possibly the greatest film franchise of all time. But I want to be objective. So, I'll try to just get the negatives out the way firstly and quickly: the film definitely has not aged well. Its PS2-worthy graphics are sometimes laughable, particularly in the troll and Quidditch sequences. In addition, the film sometimes struggles to cram everything into the short space it has - for example, that the first act with the Dursleys is so short is both a curse and a blessing: we don't get to experience the nitty-gritty early years of abuse suffered by Harry that is so well documented in the books - but on the other hand, it just means we get to the magic of Hogwarts so much faster. And finally, on a negative point, its decidedly light and almost twee tone makes it very much child-friendly, but may cause the adults to lose interest now and then. I'm sorry, but these things had to be said.But let's face it - who cares? To anyone who's never seen or read Harry Potter before, this is the compulsory stepping stone in what turns out to be a most magnificent journey. So brilliantly crafted by Columbus and of course Rowling, Philosopher's Stone features some of the best acting talent Britain has to offer - special mentions going to Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, the late Richard Harris and, in particular, Alan Rickman as Snape - the role he was born to play. The sets depict almost exactly what any reader has ever imagined, and the kids - well - they're pretty bloody cute.Philosopher's Stone is not the best - it's just a taste test. What happens next is delicious.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

The book is the book; the film is the film.,"J K Rowling is a marvelous story teller.  I have enjoyed her writings, but to grasp the world of Harry Potter and his quest, repeated readings are recommended.In the same way, the film must be seen more than once (you're welcome, Warner Bros.) to rank it fairly.  I agree there were several parts of the book omitted or downplayed that should have been in the film.The film makers should heed the outcry of the purist and try to include pertinent characters and circumstances in the future.  Unfortunately they cannot print a revised edition, or can they?I went to see it with friends and family.  I don't think my youngest grandson got all of the nuances of the pictures, but Hagrid's entrance scared the heck out of him, but only for a few minutes.

A craze swiftly becomes a phenomenon.,"As the Harry Potter film swoops into the top 5 highest grossing films of all time it seems clear that Chris Columbus has achieved what both Warner Bros and himself set out to do, to make a blockbuster that could appeal, like the books, to both kids and adults across the globe.Within 5 minutes of the film beginning it is clear that Columbus is playing it safe, however in his attempt to stay true to the book he fails to produce a film that is either magical, such as Peter Jackson has achieved with The Lord of the Rings, or produce a work which captures the spirit and emotion of Rowling's creation.The film manages to recreate some scenes from the book almost to the letter, whilst at the same time completely missing out ones which are far more important. The tone and focus also seems wrong, and unlike the books there is far more emphasis on the Indiana Jones style machinations of Harry and Voldemort that on Harry's desperate attempts to fit into a world which he never knew existed, with the threat of a return to his previous life hanging over him.On the acting front Daniel Radcliffe is solid if occasionally wooden as Harry, but the show is stolen by the superb performances of the other two child stars. Rupert Grint pulls off Ron Weasley entirely convincingly, as does Emma Watson as Hermione. The performances of Maggie Smith, Richard Harris and Alan Rickman are all up to their usual high standard, and Robbie Coltrane is perfect as Hagrid, almost as if he had walked off the pages of the book itself.In conclusion the film is good, but it could have been so much more, if Columbus had either been willing to take more of a risk and really produced some magic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Second time - no way...,"There has been so many comments about the acting,special effects,Columbus,dependence on the book and so on,that there is no point to talk about those things.But I am honestly interested to know did anybody else think that the music was entirely unsuitable and mostly just irritating?",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A pretty good special effects showcase that loses much of the book's verbal charm,"I liked the movie, and though it did a pretty good job of presenting a ""Cliff's Notes"" version of the book.  (Well, not really.  Real Cliff's Notes typically include analysis along with the synopsis that students sometimes use to avoid reading the whole book.)  For someone who has read the book, the movie is somewhat superfluous, although it is a decent effects showcase. For someone who hasn't read the book, it's a good shortcut to the story, although it misses a lot of the verbal cleverness of the book.Since most people who are likely to be interested in the movie have already read the book (unless they're parents there with kids who are fans), and the movie doesn't add anything to the book in terms of storytelling, the only fair way to rate it for most viewers is on the basis of the effects.  In terms of technical craftsmanship, I thought the effects were very good, but they weren't so hot in terms of artistic creativity.  That is, the effects were mostly stuff that we've all seen before, but it was very skillfully done collection of stuff we've seen before.Compared to the long history of mostly-awful fantasy movies, it's an outstanding movie, near the cream of the crop.  But since it was released in a year that also included the first Lord of the Rings movie, it looks pretty weak.  But just think how brilliant it would have looked if its main fantasy competitor had been something like the cartoon Lord of the Rings, the Dungeons and Dragons movie or Ator the Fighting Eagle.(I didn't actually see the D&D movie; I was warned off by critics. But I did see Ator way back when, and then saw it again by mistake when it was re-released with a different title, and even wrote an IMDB review for it.)",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Postcards from Hogwarts,"I've read all the Harry Potter books with my daughter. They're best for ages 8 to 10. They're fun but not great. This movie is not as much fun. People who think it keeps to the book should re-read the book.There wasn't much buildup to the climactic scene. It just seemed to suddenly happen. In the book, Harry seemed to have earned the right to confront and defeat Voldemort, but in the movie, he just happens to end up in the right place at the right time, and with no particular effort, emerges victorious.This movie is like a postcard version of the book, but with less emotion than you can put into a postcard. As many others have said, it's passable if you've read the book, but only because you are then able to fill in the tension, emotion, and character development missing from the movie.Casting was okay. Radcliffe is adequate as Potter. Rupert Grint is better as Ron. Emma Watson's hair isn't right. Robbie Coltrane is superb as Hagrid. Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith - blah, blah, blah. John Hurt's excellence as Mr. Ollivander is much appreciated.I gave ""Harry Potter"" a 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Good but some weak characterisation. Needed more humour.,"This was a fair attempt but more had gone into the effects than character & humour. The best actors were Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy & Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid. They were spot on. Unfortunately my favourite character, Hermione, was not as sympathetic as in the book. Instead I prefered Draco but he didn't get as much screen time as he deserved. The ghosts were under used too & Peeves was absent entirely. Since he and the Weasley twins provide most of the humour there wasn't much to be found. I liked the moving figures in the paintings and the floating candles but again these moments were only fleeting. I didn't like the Quidditch Match but then it wasn't that interesting in the book either. I was relieved the Dursleys were cut short as they are just annoying and hateful. The snake could have been left out though. I'm not too fond of the species so had to close my eyes for a few minutes. There is more fun to be had reading the book. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A very good rendering of a comic that is actually a novel.,"I couldn't help the feeling of emptiness after watching Harry Potter. The movie is wonderfully rendered. Acting is great. The only problem is that, the movie was either on a tight budget or on time contraints.Watching the movie, you can't help but get the feeling that the director is trying to put as many aspects of the original novel into the movie that he doesn't give any of them justice.For instance, Harry's family, they are protrayed sarcastically in the start and then completely forgotten, even Harry doesn't seem to recall they exist.Another example, is this Centaur that jumps in, saves Harry, and leaves. To people who read the novel, they might know who that is and feel empowered by such knowledge.. To the majority that didn't.. They are left feeling that a scene in which the centaur tells Harry who he is should be there.And so the movie goes, after a slow calm start, the movie runs in similar fashion, at first portraying Harry's miserable childhood, and then quickly leaving that and taking you to Hogwarts where the movie portrays the wonders of the school and then leaves them there and shifts focus to the sorcerer's stone and Voldemort. And just when you get emersed into that, the final conflict is quickly upon you and it is one of the weakest final conflicts you have ever seen in a fantasy movie. There is no real battle.. No grand finale, no suspense. Nothing. Just a dead end. Perhaps the Novel had more to offer, but the movie did not, and so a better ending was in order.And so, after leaving the movie, you feel pleased and disappointed. Every rendering of one aspect of Harry's story was accurate, the problem is that the sum of it didn't really fit together well nor did it do the story well. In fact, if there was one theme to the whole movie, it would be the four houses that the apprentices are inducted into. Which is sad because there are greater themes in the novel itself, but this is the only theme that flows through out the movie. Everything else pops in and then quickly pops out again.I think the best solution to this problem would be to make the movie longer.. At least an extra hour of film is missing from this rendition of the Harry Potter stories. This is why I felt the movie was cut short for some reason. Any one can feel it. Every rendering that took place was accurate, but not one rendering gave justice to the original novel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A great film adaptation but. . .,"For starters, i am a huge Harry Potter fan. Not because it's a craze right now or because everyone else is reading it, but because I read the books and have grown a love for them, for the amazing story lines and intricate plot points. And the characters are all three dimensional and well written, and you can't help but feel for them. JK Rowling has put a lot of time and planning into this little baby of hers, and it shows.Hence, I've been waiting for this movie to come out ever since I first heard about it. I have avoided movie reviews and all other such nonsense as much as possible so I could have my own unbiased opinion of a movie that is based on books I love so much.Well, one of my favorite parts was the Monster's Inc trailer directly before it. This Trailer alone is worth the price of admission! But enough of that, on to the movie.Well, Being the enormous Potter fan that I am, my main concern was for it to stay true to the books. So I will start with the good things about the movie first.All of the characters were perfectly cast. The girl who played Hermione was exactly how I pictured her to be, and did a dead on performance. The special effects were amazing, and I have become especially impressed with how far technology has come in the last few years. The story line also contained most of the key events in the novel and was almost entirely true to it. It is one of the best film adaptations to a book I have ever seen, and I must say that I did enjoy it.However, I must admit that this movie has its weaknesses. And it is not the fault of the movie, its director, or its actors. The fault in the movie lies in the fact that it is based on a book that has a very large and loyal fan base, many of which have read this book more then once, and know it cover to cover.This movie clocked in at nearly 2 and a half hours and it still seemed entirely too short. The book is so complex, in that it and all the books following are all interconnected, and there is fore shadowing in every one. All of these events seem important, whether in character development or in relation to the current or future plots. There are so many secondary characters in this book that they aren't given nearly enough screen time. (the Dursley's for instance, one small example.  Fred and George Weasley, another. These two are a couple of my favorite characters and we didn't see nearly enough of them!) I felt that we weren't given quite a clear glimpse of Snape's absolute loathing of Harry Potter, or why he was helping Harry if he hated him so much. This is important to the character of Snape. And this kind of stuff seemed to happen entirely to often.That has to be my main concern, however. Because I've read these books and know them so well, I can all to clearly point out things that are missing from the original book, and even though I was enjoying myself, this kept plaguing on my mind and somewhat distracted me. Because I have read this book, I know certain facts that it was necessary to leave out due to length of the film was already at monstrous proportions.  And I noticed that they were missing.Which leads me to the next fault of the movie. Because it wanted to stay so true to the books, so much information needed to be included into the movie, and I got the impression that the movie was slightly rushed. The transition from one time period to the next, as this book takes place over the course of a school year, makes it need far more time to go through that.Alright, overall, I give this 3 out of 4 stars, as it was a noble effort on behalf of the production team to bring this movie to life, and although I sound like I'm nit-picking the movie, I was impressed, as I think they did the best they could with the material. However, before watching it yourself, I would recommend picking up the first book if you haven't already (as most of you should have by now). This movie is a companion piece to the far superior book that it is based upon, and I wouldn't see it as anything other then that.  If you see this movie without at some point reading the book, you are missing out greatly.Well, this book is also the shortest in the series so far, which has me thinking. I have such a vivid imagination of the other three books and characters, do I need a movie to describe events in the book when I prefer the book to a director's version of it? And if I was distracted by missing information in the portrayal of the first one, do I need to even bother watching any future renditions?Oh well, I'll probably watch the future ones anyway. I'll just know what to expect and expect to have a good time!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The kids are alright,"I saw this in a theater that was completely full, with a crowd that buzzed excitedly over the Scooby Doo preview before the feature.  The major thing that I noticed was the complete lack of buzz during the film.  No laughs, no sudden breaths, very little sound at all.  I think the movie simply moved too fast, and everyone felt the need to focus on the screen completely so as not to miss anything.  I understand the problems in adapting a widely read and hugely successful novel to a screenplay, so I empathize with the screenwriter. I enjoyed the film, even at the 2.5 hour length, and I recommend that fans of the books see it, but I do not think children under 7-8 would sit through the second half. One negative (somewhat) was the seeming lack of special effects in a movie about a wizard.  What effects were there were fairly shoddy. The three main actors, particularly the adorable little Hermione, were wonderful.  But why was John Cleese included for a two line role?  The same for John Hurt.

I can think of dozens of childrens' movies that are superior to this one including Shrek and Monsters Inc. which are playing at the same time. Compared to a true classic like ET, this Harry Potter movie appears weak even by muggle standards.With only a few exceptions the acting here was wooden and uninspired. Maggie Smith as Professor/Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall stood out as did David Bradley as Caretaker Argus Filch. Robbie Coltrane as Gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid also had his moments. The kids were cute, but they all acted as if they were reading their lines and Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe)had pretty well one expression for every occasion. The special effects were pedestrian.As others have also noted, director Chris Columbus would have been better off to leave out some parts of the book and concentrate on doing a better job with the parts he kept. As it is, the movie rushes forward, lurching from one scene to another and barely taking the time to develop characters or any kind of dramatic tension.What made the first book so enjoyable for me was the excitement of discovering a magic world existing side-by-side with the muggles. It was so much fun to experience Harry's surprise and wonderment when he is first introduced to that world. This movie captures none of that. For a movie about wizards and witches there is painfully little magic to be found here.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Less than expected,"I was both anxious and reluctant to see the Harry Potter movie, because it is always tricky to make a movie live up to the level of the book.  With the J. K. Rowling involved with the movie making, I expected it to be a fairly consistent movie, with the book story only edited to make it fit within the timespan of a movie, and keep people's attention (easier to do in writing than in visual aspects).Unfortunately, parts were apparently edited out without much attention to consistency.  To start at the end...  Why was Snape's test (right before Dumbledore's) removed, while it was the main basis for the points given for Hermione in the end?  What was the point in having Neville try to stop Harry, Ron and Hermione from leaving the Gryffindor common room, when the movie did not contain the reasons why alot of people (including Neville) felt that Harry, Ron and Hermione shouldn't be risking losing more points for Gryffindor?It all adds up to a rather weak storyline, and frankly I would have been at a loss seeing this movie without reading the book.  It just doesn't add up. Without the book knowledge to fill in the blanks, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone seems hardly more than a movie with alot of publicity around it, and a poorly developed storyline *in the movie itself*.Of course, the book and the storyline therein is marvelous!",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Childhood movie,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a magical adventure that brings the beloved book series to life. The film follows the story of young Harry Potter as he discovers that he is a wizard and begins his education at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.The cast of the film is excellent, with standout performances from Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint as Harry, Hermione, and Ron, respectively. The supporting cast is also fantastic, with memorable performances from Alan Rickman as Professor Snape and Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall.The special effects in the film are impressive, bringing the magical world of Hogwarts to life. From the moving staircases to the flying broomsticks, the film creates a sense of wonder and awe that is sure to delight audiences of all ages. The music, composed by John Williams, is also fantastic, with a memorable and stirring score that perfectly captures the mood of the film.One of the strengths of the film is its faithfulness to the source material. While some details are inevitably left out, the film captures the essence of J. K. Rowling's story and brings it to life on the big screen. Fans of the book series will appreciate the attention to detail and the care that was taken to bring their favorite characters to life.Overall, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a fantastic movie that captures the magic of the Harry Potter series. It's a great introduction to the world of Hogwarts and the characters that inhabit it.

The magic begins,"This first film in the Harry Potter series spends a lot of time setting up the story for the later instalments while still managing to be entertaining in its own right.The three leads all look very meek, mild and very young but still give good performances alongside their established nearly all British elders.The plot moves along at a quick pace and the former Home Alone director Collumbus is able to combine the magic and humour from the original novel with all the darkness and visual aids that only cinema could offer. Although the warmth can be a little cloying at times the balance is by and large good.Overall a solid first instalment to the series and a must for anyone discovering Potter for the first time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"enjoyable, but it's not the book","Elements of the book that have been edited I would have liked to have seen included but differences from the book were inevitable. The biggest disappointment for me was the quidditch game during which the slytherin team came across as comic-book characters rather than sinister and cynical as they seemed to me in the book. However it remains engrossing despite knowing the story in much detail beforehand. The child actors turn in respectable performances and much of the adult cast is superb, particularly - for me - Alan Rickman as Professor Snape. The sets are superb although there is slightly too much dependence on cg effects in some parts. Perhaps this comment sounds negative but despite the niggles - mainly based on the impossible task of recreating the book precisely - it remains a worthy and entertaining adaptation of the story. 8 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Great in some ways, messy in others","Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone is great in some ways and messy in others. On the positive, it creates an ambitious, fantastical world. The settings, wardrobes, and props all carry ample weight in producing a magical atmosphere. Meanwhile, the iconic music sets an adventurous and mystical tone. Lastly, the casting is excellent. Most of the adults are extremely talented (namely Alan Rickman) and the children, despite their novice here, all became quite respected in their own rights. Together, this establishes a foundation for the franchise to build on.On the other hand, The Sorcerer's Stone's most glaring flaw is its inconsistent acting. The children are decent for their age, but that is faint praise. Plus, they are center stage so their shortcomings are more noticeable. Next, the writing is cliché. Because the emotional beats are rushed, the plot corniness stands out and rings slightly hollow. Finally, while the special effects are elaborate and occasionally strong, there is plenty of CGI that aged poorly. Unfortunately, this holds that aspect back from being an outright strength. In the end, The Sorcerer's Stone is a very competent film that falls a bit short of its lofty notoriety.Writing: 6/10

"Good, but could have been better","A very good attempt, fast action all the way, perfect for the younger viewers to keep them enthralled through the longer than average running time, but not really thorough enough to please the people who appreciate the intricate and intimate relationships between the central characters and their backgrounds. The amount of 'family history' missing from Harry and Ron's lives completeley changes their characters; you don't know why Harry is living in a cupboard or what a terrible upbringing he's had, you don't realise how the Weasley family's financial struggle is a constant embarrassment for Ron, so the 2 boys seem a lot happier and carefree than the books portray them.Voldemort, the most evil, feared and one of the most famous wizards in the magical world is hardly mentioned and you don't get the feeling of how times have changed. Professor Dumbledore is a central and well developed character in the book and is portrayed as wise but eccentric and playful. None of this showed in his film character, so the conversation between him and Harry at the end of the movie is a bit of 'catch-up'. Similar missing character development can be seen in Neville Longbottom, so his fifteen seconds of fame at the end are meaningless, and Professor Snape, who you don't have any reason to hate other than his sneering voice.Couldn't fault the acting, great casting, especially with the adult characters. Shame the kids all sound posh, though. Note to Americans, we don't all sound like that!On the plus side, the effects capture the magical creatures and flying antics beautifully, though I feel just a little bit more effort could have made the magic wands a bit more 'magic'.In summary, fast moving, a little too fast, and probably an additional well chosen 10 minutes of character development would have helped to please more people.  After reading some of the other comments here, I can see that people who haven't read the books found it hard going in the beginning, until the action at hogwarts got going. The thing is, all the plot-building at the beginning is there for a reason so I'd say to those people: You should have read the book!I just hope there'll be an extended version when it comes out on DVD!If I hadn't read the book, 8 out of 10.  But I have, so I'll have to say 7.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A magical holiday classic,"First off- I really, really enjoyed this movie. Very much. It had the same feeling of the book(s) but of course it couldn't cover as much as the book could (it would be near impossible to do it). For instance, a lot of the characters didn't have as much screen time as they are mentioned in the book. (It seems that Snape, Quirrell, George, Fred and Percy Weasly had bigger roles; and Hedwig, I can't even remember the name being mentioned) But really, that doesn't matter. What matters is that the movie is good or not, and it is.There aren't a lot of family movies that capture the kind of humor and adventure/drama that this one does. Just for record, I've read all the books, so that might make me a bit biased, but really its a good adaption.The acting is superb. I honestly think there should be Academy Award nominations for this movie, both in acting and the movie itself.-Richard Harris, Maggie Smith,Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane are PERFECT!!, they are so good at capturing the essence of their characters, that shouldn't go without a nomination.-Also, Daniel Radcliffe does a very, very good job as Harry. I liked him in this part because you can tell he wasn't overly acting like some child stars do; instead his shy/quiet nature was exactly like Harry Potter -Emma Watson and Rupert Grint were also PERFECT as their roles of Hermione and Ron, respectively. They really have a talent.-Great Movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"A little rough around the edges, but in the long run you won't mind","""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" (Or Sorcerer's stone depending on your region) introduces a complicated world filled with a lot of ideas and characters. It isn't perfect and it's obvious that as the first instalment, it was unclear to the director and screenwriter as to what would work and what wouldn't. Sometimes it follows the novel too closely with some characters and ideas that overall could have been left out (the ghosts for example, do not play an important part in this first story) and at times it's awkward to have us bounce quickly in-between all of the classes the students attend. However, it does a good job of introducing us to this world, it has a lot of really memorable moments, a great cast and there's a lot of imagination here (some from the movie, some from the original book). I wouldn't say that my love for the Harry Potter series, both the films and the books influence me when I say that this is a good movie. It's a humble beginning to a series of films that's sure to become essential viewing and a lot of people's favourite for years to come.

"Great visuals, but bad script","Everywhere I looked, there was always something about Harry Potter. As the hype began to get bigger and bigger, my curiosity got the better of me and I fell into the trap of reading the first book. To my surprise, I was totally engrossed in the story from start to finish. Being in my 20s, I was sceptical about a book aimed at a younger age group, but I found that you do not have to be young, only young at heart to enjoy it.However, the movie left me feeling a little disappointed. Visually, it was fantastic to watch, especially the Quidditch match, but the screenplay did not live up to the standards of the book. I realize that not every little detail can be included into an already quite long movie, but some of the details which were omitted from the movie may have left some Harry Potter first-timers lost or detached from the main characters.Audiences could not warm to Harry as his character was very one dimensional and there was a blink-and-you'll-miss explanation of why he was so special. This left audiences in the dark and they could not relate to the character and his plight. Harry was boring and there seemed to be nothing special about him at all. Ron Weasley however, was the highlight of the movie, with the casting being more accurate to the book than that of Harry. Overall, this was a good movie and kids will surely enjoy it. For adults who have read the book though, they may be a bit more nitpicky and be left feeling a bit disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
quite decent,"Of course, the book is better, but the movie stands on its own rather well. They did an excellent job of translating as much of the book as possible, editing smartly. Still, the pacing felt rushed to me, and there was never any real sense of the kids learning, no montage sequence of them in classes. Additionally, Quirrel was non-existent. there was no reason to fear him, nor Voldemort. The sense of danger must be developed in the following films.

This proves that It's a well taken story. Because as I noted it has a lot of influence from Star wars and the never ending story, like a combination of both.This is what makes this movie special, the way they took a not very original story and made it a good film.Any way, I must say that liked the film, not loved it; it's one of those movies that you can watch a Sunday afternoon, It didn't improved anything to the movie business in any way, it just broke box office records , but It's good...just...good.So, watch it, if you don't , you are not missing any great thing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
An excellent illustration to the book,"There have been some truly excellent reviews, so I just wanted to add a few strokes which the previous people might have missed.The Director swore to stay close to the book and he did that. Too close in fact, so to those of us who are familiar with the book and see movies as an art form in itself it looked like a series of excellent illustrations with moving characters in them (like illustrations in all the magical books should be :) I was curious how it would look to someone who had NOT read the book (yes however hard it is to believe, but such people do exist), and I found one. Her reaction was: ""It was a very pretty cartoon strip"".And finally the Quidditch (?sp?) Match was perhaps a bit too long and had too much influence of G.

Ok...but lacking in something magical,"Let me start by saying that I am among the few who have not read any of the Harry Potter books...and I am also one of the few who did not flock to the theatre as soon as Harry Potter was released. I did finally go to see it today, only because I had a request to make a Harry Potter costume for somebody for Halloween...so I had to check it out. I was also curious to see the ""famous"" Harry Potter...and check out the film that is up against Fellowship of the Ring for an Oscar in Art Direction, Music Score and Costume Design. Sounds as if I might be a bit biased against Harry Potter already doesn't it? I'll admit I was. But don't jump to conclusions yet....After seeing the film I can say that on some levels I enjoyed it. It was a wonderful, albeit too long, children's film. I liked most of the characters, but especially Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid. I think Daniel Radcliffe did a fine job as Harry and enjoyed Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley. I told my husband after the movie that I would have enjoyed it immensely had I been 10 years old. I found the first half (at least) of the movie to be incredibly slow, as if it were setting up the plot to come. The plot was slow too...too much concentration on the details of Hogwarts instead of developing the story IMO. FX weren't all that great if you ask me (particularly the end with Lord Voldemart-spelling?-I found it rather cheesy, not to mention the troll. Speaking of the troll, I recall someone telling me that the troll in the Fellowship fo the Rings was probably copied from HP&SS...ehem...well, while I found the troll in FOTR rather lacking, it was much better than the one in HP. He reminded me of Shrek!The music was one of the high points in my opinion...it was the most magical touch to the movie. It fit perfectly most of the time and wasn't too overpowering for the most part.The costume design was OK, but it was well rather costumey. It didn't feel real, yet I'm not sure it was suppose to. I think this film is intended to be pure fantasy...childlike fantasy. HP was good light entertainment, enought to take you away for an afternoon, granted you have comfortable theatre seats...it seemed to drag on.As far as my seeing it to assess the competition Fellowship of the Ring has for an Oscar...I would think the FOTR has nothing to worry about from HP.

Magic carpet unravels,"This movie, based on the book of the same name, starts a wee bit too sluggish, features some nice special effects in the later half and gets downright cheesy and predictable at the end. It relays the story of a young lad who discovers he has untold abilities in the art of wizardry and builds thereon with the process of his schooling in said talent. The character development is way too slow in portions and non-existent in others--unless you've read the book, you don't have much chance of knowing who they're talking about, considering they have such weird names. It has moments of neatness (""sorting hat"", ""moving stairwells"", etc.), but you never feel immersed in the ""Hogwarts"" world. I got the vibe they should have either totally hammed it up or made it quite a bit more gritty. Alas, it appears yet another novel couldn't be properly consolidated into a film format.

The Mgic World,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is the first novel in the Harry Potter series and J. K. Rowling's debut novel, first published in 1997 by Bloomsbury.

The plot follows Harry Potter, a young wizard who discovers his magical heritage as he makes close friends and a few enemies in his first year at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. With the help of his friends, Harry faces an attempted comeback by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who killed Harry's parents, but failed to kill Harry when he was just a year old.The novel won most of the British book awards that were judged by children and other awards in the US.

Harry Potter didn't transfix this middle-aged Muggle,"As an adult with no children and having not read any of the books I was wondering what all the fuss was about. Obviously I can't make comparison or express disappointments between book and film but I can see enough strange, menacing and funny characters as well as myriad incidents to keep most children enthralled for more than two hours. We can clearly see where the money has been well spent in transforming this parallel magical universe into something that George Lucas would put his name to. I was rather surprised by the relatively subdued reaction of the(mostly under 15) audience both during and at the end of the movie, with few fearful gasps or hoots of laughter that makes me wonder that my simliar behaviour was not so off the mark. I feel there is not very much in this film for most adults (or their inner children) especially when one compares it to brilliant efforts like the Toy Stories, Shrek and not to mention all the Simpsons episodes.

I personally need something more in a movie before it really impresses me, and before it deserves such tremedous glorification as Harry Potter seems to be recieving.

Fantastic start to the series!,"I had not read any of the Harry Potter-books when this came out but like most people in the world i easily knew who Harry Potter was before I heard they were going to make the book into a movie. After i saw the first film, i could see why people loved the story. The story is very fresh but that isn't something you see lately in other fantasy stories. It also brings in a lot of knew things into the genre that have stayed with us until now. The characters are colorful to say the least and very memorable but that is the main thing when you are writing a series of books, to make the characters likable and memorable. This world J.K Rowling has made is quite charming and beautiful.Fantasy movies are often very badly done but here Harry Potter is a step in the right direction. The movie looks fantastic and good acting is found in every corner.Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane and John Hurt all do great and really gave them self's all into their roles, not only being seen like to often happens when stars like these are casted. The movie is all about the three little kids Harry Potter, Ron Weasly and Hermione Granger, who are delivered to you by the talented Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emmu Watson. Grint was the man to look at, he was funny and just right for the part or so I have been told, he didn't fail in any scene and that is amazing for a kid at his age. Radcliff looks the part alright and does a solid job in his role but at times he overacts for no reason like for example the scene where Hagrid tels Harry ""You're a wizard Harry!"" but still for a kid at his age, he does an amazing job. Watson is wonderful as the self-involved Hermione and makes a very colorful character.One of the most positive things about this movie is how quickly the movie went by, even being more then two hours. It's either because of the script-writer Steve Kloves who wrote the great Wonder Boys or the director himself but either way it's quite wonderful to be so intrigued and entertained at the same time that two and a half hours goes by like nothing. I don't know the book but the story seems to work alright and I felt nothing really needed to be added. There is enough of action to see like with the Quidditch-game or the obstacles. The main mystery is also quite strangely exiting and it really dragged me into the movie. Chris Colombus does a wonderful job introducing the world and letting the viewer get sucked in.The movie could have been a lot darker but knowing now it will get darker and darker with every movie, it's not something I can really complain about. I am not talking about any Tim Burton style, I just know that the book was quite darker.8/10 -- There's a lot of charm in this movie and it was probably my favorite movie that has ever come out at Christmas.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Still, it isn't about the scariness, but about the magic that ""Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone"" contains. Based on the book by J. K Rowling, (That I really enjoyed reading) I think this is an amazing adaptation. The story becomes a fast icon in the world, and now everyone knows who the famous Harry Potter is, and I noticed the book shelfs became more empty with time, the book grossing go higher and higher, and I can't really argue, the story is developed so well, in the book and in the movie. But here it is about the movie of course. First of all, nothing is greater than some high quality music from our famous John Williams (Jurassic Park) and (Schindler's List) and the magical and convincing directing by Chris Colombus. The visual effects and scenography was on a fine level, Hogwarts castle is a rememberable building with so many hidden secrets to reveal. The acting was on a decent level, too, but the kids are playing way better than I would expect from a youngster. Harry James Potter performed by Daniel Radcliffe is a good addition to the film and he got into character. Harry's backstory with his parents makes the story even more dramatic and gets a better understanding for our main hero. Harry's two friends, Ron and Hermione, makes them the perfect trio, and they're showing friendship and courage in a good and valuable way. Since they're at school, some bullies got to be involved, and Draco Malfoy was a such a fun and menacing character as a kid. It's the beginning, so it's supposed to be the best one, but overall I think this is just a fine start and a great magical adventure. It's not bad, but it's nothing so impressive that I can give a very high rating. It's definitely a nice script, great acting and music, and something your kid can really enjoy (but for adults this may be just something decent).",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Magical, charming, and wizardry world is brought to the big screen.","Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone (4 out of 5 stars).The first movie in the series delivers a well detailed world that J.k. Rowlings wrote. I have never read the novels. Or not a huge fan. The movie does take its time with its epic storytelling. For its long running time, the film seems to get a lot of details from the book. The plot is good. The cast has a good ensemble. The music score is good. The film is a little slow moving with its direction. The set pieces are good. The quidditch scene was intense and exciting. The fans may love the movie. Other audiences may like it as well if they patience for its storytelling.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Wonderful!!!!!,"I saw this film with my friends.When I sat on my chair,I was so emotioned!I couldn't think this beautiful book was going to be taken on the screen!Well,I didn't move my face on for over two hours!The most wonderful scene was Quidditch match!!!!!Really fantastic!Daniel Radcliffe is pretty good at playing Harry Potter,but the cleverest was Emma Watson!As regards grown-up actors,the best were Robbie Coltrane,perfect as Hagrid,and Alan Rickman as Snape!But the movie shouldn't be longer than like this,'cause then it could bore some little children!Although many of them were being quite careful to the events!When the movie was over,my friends and I were sweating!Because I think that ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is the best film for children!But it can be seen even by people over that age,such as also by childless couples,'cause it wishes to be an enjoyment for everyone of us!Go watching it and will come out with a great fun about it!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Not a just a kid movie, so much more than that","I had low expectations before seeing this movie- I thought Harry Potter was just some kiddie phase that somehow made it from book to big screen.  Boy was I wrong.  This movie is a pretty good start to a series I'm getting sucked in to.  It's perfect for kids, a new classic story for them to enjoy and even learn from.  I liked it because of it's  imagination and originality.  Worth a watch. B+, 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
An excellent movie,"I'm glad I read (and enjoyed) the book before seeing this movie, because I think it improved the overall experience. HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE is fun for all ages with outstanding acting from just about everyone involved, likeable characters, beautiful scenery, impressive special effects, funny jokes and good drama. The THE WIZARD OF OZ (9/10) of this generation. Highly recommended.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"The Best of the Franchise, Filled with Energy and Spark","Harry Potter was a series that didn't quite live up its full potential that was orchestrated in ""The Sorcerer's Stone"".This first episode is by far the best of the series. It's well directed with a brisk but immersive pace that has an enormous amount of content to get through, but director Chris Columbus masterfully executes it perfectly by focusing on the target audience and indulging them with a wealth of exceptional visuals combined with a sense of hope.It could be strongly argued that this is also the best acted Harry Potter. Everyone seems energised and excited to be part of this production, and Emma Watson in particular gives the most fun performance of the series.However the underlining problems with the world building ultimately starts here, and there are elements that are too silly even for kids. Thankfully it is not the focus of this movie and it plays to its strengths with great cinematography and content.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Nice but unbalanced,"The first part of the movie is very good with an excellent re-creation of the atmosphere imagined by J. K Rowling in the book on which it was inspired. All visual special effects are very imaginative and of very good quality. The characters are well designed and very convincing. The human nature (bad or good) of these wizards is extremely well shaped and their performances extremely charming. Well this is true for the first part of the movie which shows, so to speak, the presentation of Hogwarth, the wizard school and its masters and students with a special prominence of the main character of Harry Potter (a well chosen charming child actor) and his two companions Hermione and Ron. However the second part in which the main plot of the searching for the sorcerer's stone develops itself, is much less brilliant in terms of imagination and special effects, becoming sometimes a bit dull and commonplace.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Well done... Kudos!,"I'm one of the ""holdouts"" who hasn't read the books (I like Ursula K. Leguin's ""Earthsea"" series, so I figure I'd enjoy this story, although it's somewhat derivative of ""A Wizard of Earthsea"").  Anyway, I kept wishing I was 10 years old when I saw this, because I would have enjoyed it more. Still, the film was undeniably magical, the CGI/Special effects weren't overdone (or were seamless enough to blend in), and the acting was excellent.Agreed with other reviewers that the film never ""soars"" and never fully achieves what it could, but attribute this to squeezing so much plot into the film's running time.  If this movie is as faithful to the book as I understand, then it's a rarity -- ""Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Green Mile"" are two others that manage to be faithful to the book, yet in the former case somehow outdoes the book (may be the first and only time).Anyway, I'm rambling.  This film was magical & entertaining, especially for kids.  I think it suffers only from the fact that expectations were set too high due to hype, and the unbelievable popularity of the books.  You just can't expect a film to live up to the potential of the book, especially if the book is tremendously good -- it's patently unfair to judge a film based on that criteria.  9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

"Too similar to the book, but still enjoyable","The movie was basically an abridged version of the book, so, although it was interesting to see the characters brought to life, there was very little suspense.I read the second Harry Potter book, and it will be interesting to see how faithfully the film version of Harry Potter 2 sticks to the book.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Excellent Movie; Don't Believe Critics,"I saw this movie a few days after it came out, and let me tell you, it was wonderful. I am what most people call a Harry Potter fan, bordering on a fanatic. I was shocked however, when I saw it, I thought it would be EXACTLY like the book, but I found it wasn't, in fact, I found many things in the movie that did not correspond with the book, but I will not name them, so I don't spoil the movie for you, like most critics on tv and newspaper do.

"An excellent, true-to-book film","When I read the first Harry Potter book six months ago, I felt that I was reading something very special.  Indeed, an entire generation of children are growing up with something that is so wondrous and exciting, that it pales anything like it to date.  This film captures the magic of the books beautifully.  From John William's magical score, to the fast-paced Quidditch match, to the 4-star cast, this film IS Harry Potter, realized as best as humanly possible.  The trio of child actors portraying Harry, Ron, and Hermoine have perfect chemistry.  The supporting players, Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, Richard Griffiths, and especially Alan Rickman are perfect. The one casting that just blows my socks off is that of Robbie Coltrane playing the role of the giant Hagrid.  Coltrane has fun with this role, making Hagrid a perfect mentor/guide for Harry Potter as he enters this new, magical world.  Chris Columbus has done a terrific job creating this world, which could easily have been watered-down and lost in budget cuts. Excellent film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Gold.,"I just finished watching all the Harry Potter films back to back to back to back. What a crazy trip. Before starting this review, here is my ranking, from best to worst:HP4 > HP8 > HP1 > HP6 > HP7 > HP2 > HP3 > HP5The one that started it all. People really take this one for granted because if this was a horrible flop or even just mediocre, there may not have been a series or the rest of the films would has suffered. But even without that rationale, the film is excellent and totally holds up in it's own. There is a solid reason I have it ranked as the 3rd best Potter film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Enjoyable Fun.,"I have to admit that I haven't read any of the amazingly popular novel's from which this movie came. However, after viewing this film, I am certainly tempted to do so. While this film is certainly designed for the preadolescent market, it has those necessary hooks to keep even the most hardened realist of an adult interested.Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is a young wizard, who after his parents were killed, was left with his mean and un-magical, aunt, uncle and bratty cousin who force him to live under the stairs. However, on his 11th birthday he is accepted into the Hogwart's School for young witches and wizards and enters a world of magic and mystery. While at school, he and his classmates Ronald Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) set out on a quest to find the Sorcerer's Stone (which will bring immortality to those who possess it) and to prevent an evil wizard from acquiring it.Outside of the main cast of children (who are excellent); this film is chocked full with an astounding cast of British actors. Robbie Coltrane (Henry V, GoldenEye) is perfect as the lumbering and loveable giant, Rubeus Hagrid. Alan Rickman (Bob Roberts, Dogma) once again proves that he can do sinister better than any living actor. English heavyweights Richard Harris (The Guns of Navarone, Unforgiven) and Maggie Smith (Tea with Mussolini, Gosford Park) give good performances. The short appearances by John Cleese (Life of Brian, A Fish Called Wanda) and John Hurt (I Claudius) round out this superb cast.The cinematography is fun and inventive with a superb use of computer special effects. The setting is a combination of gothic horror and Dickensian melodrama, which works to good effect. The story combines fairy tales of every shape and kind. From Cinderella to Greek and Roman mythologies, this movie weaves a storyline that is fun to follow. The appearance of Cerberus, the three-headed dog, now renamed as Fluffy is especially amusing.Now, despite all of these good things, the fact of the matter is that this is a fluff adventure. The characters are fairly cookie-cutter with very little time given to character development. The storyline is convoluted by its attempt to juggle too many plot lines. However, it is fun to watch and I'm glad I checked it out. I may have to borrow a child so I can go watch the next one in the theatres.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
You Do Not Need To Be A PHILOSOPHER'S Assistant To Know That This Is An Alright Start To The Series,"It is always difficult beginning a new story, let alone a new series.

All the big names really connected with their characters respectfully.I enjoyed watching this film but I felt that it was missing something, and I also felt that the storyline of this film was a bit cliché. Rowling provided everyone with a series that turned out to be huge but the first instalment is always a letdown in some way. I am not saying that it is bad, it needed more. Although, this series is for everyone who is big on fantasy and adventure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Okay,"All those Harry Potter movies were just okay. The books were funny enough, and all the movie adaptations were decent and satisfying. I'm not a big fan of those book, but I liked them. Daniel Radcliffe was a very good choice as Harry Potter, he is very handsome and talented. The performances, the script and the special effects were good enough, not as good as better films as ""Avatar"" and ""Watchmen"", but were good. My only problem with all the Harry Potter films is that all of those movies are pretty long. Since those book and movies are aimed to children they should be shorter, I guess. All the Harry Potter films are good, but I still prefer ""Avatar"", because ""Avatar"" has aliens, and I love aliens.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"The Magic Comes To Life, In A Bit Of A Dull Way","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone had a lot to live up to as a book-to-film adaptation. For-the-most-part, the movie delivers as being entertaining, but any fans wanting more than a passing movie might be disappointed.The story of this movie of course revolves around Harry Potter, his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy. In this movie Harry just turns eleven and suddenly discovers he's a wizard, and probably the most famous one at that. More details are revealed in the movie about Harry's past but I won't spoil them for those who have yet to experience the books or movies of Potter.As far as being a loyal translation, Columbus does an excellent job. Yes, plenty from the book is left out of the movie but all the vital moments are in the movie. The moments that did make it to the movie are very loyal to the book, almost too loyal. While I give Columbus credit to making the movie loyal it's just too confined, not just for the young actors in the movie but the impact on the audience as well. It's this that makes Sorcerer's Stone no more than a worthy and passing effort by Columbus.The young actors that play as Harry, Ron and Hermione are all perfect picks by Columbus, which is definitely a plus. Radcliffe as Potter is a great selection as is Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley. But Emma Watson proves as the most creditable selection and as the most mature of the young trio. Surprisingly, the actors and actresses that play the professors do a better job than our three young heroes. Not only are the selections for the professors perfect, but they add a great flair to their roles that make them seem even better for their role.The presentation of Sorcerer's Stone is magical, no doubt, a great movie for the holidays, but it just isn't enough. The movie is fairly long, at over two hours and for some it will seem as if the film drags on too much. While the translation of the teachers, students and plot of the book is done very nicely it's how everything else is executed where the movie falls apart too. Yes, the final tasks near the end of the movie and the Quidditch match are fun to watch but far from stunning.The result in Sorcerer's Stone is that it's a good movie through and through, but people, especially fans of the books like myself will feel let down by the movie. Now, this isn't a bad movie, there's lots to love in the film's magical flair from the introduction of the students, teachers and other cast members that make appearances in later films. But, if you're expecting a movie that will dazzle you then you're asking for too much of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Everything I didn't expect,"Like most people I was really worried about a number of things. First, of course, wether the movie would (or could) remain faithful to the book. This was not too bad. It was a pity for me that they didn't keep in all of the details, but I can understand this, because it would turn into a 5 or 6-hour movie if they would, and that, of course, is way too long. Second, I also had my doubts about the director, yet then again, his Home-Alone-films are great for children. Critics may dislike this kind of movie, but children don't, so why worry about that? Bu I would not like to see Harry Potter turn into a boy who starts crying his eyes out every three minutes. Fortunately, he didn't. Good for him. Third, the special effects. I have seen a lot of movies, with or without special effects, and from my point of view, they're rather disappointing. Therefor, I was absolutely satisfied with the effects of the troll and the quidditch-match. Fourth, the actors. I think nobody looks more like Harry Potter than Daniel Radcliffe. For a child actor, his acting is great. But my favorite is Rupert Grind as Ron Weasly. He is exactly like portrayed in the book. Emma Watson, who plays Hermione Granger, looks a but other than I had imagined after reading the book, but she acts exactly like J.K. Rowling described in her books. Alan Rickman, being one of my personal favorites, is the perfect embodyment of professor Snape (my favorite in the books!!!). It's a shame he doesn't get to show how mean he really is. Maggy Smith as professor McGonagal fits the part perfect, and this also goes for Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid. Overall, I think this movie will make it to my favorite-list. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Magical Worldbuilding but Spellbinding Acting,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the first film in the beloved Harry Potter franchise, is a magical journey that transports the viewer into a world full of wonder and imagination. The film does an excellent job of introducing the audience to the Wizarding World, and the impressive attention to detail in the world-building is what makes this film so special.The set design and visual effects in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone are outstanding. The grandeur of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is breathtaking, and the magical creatures that inhabit the Wizarding World are enchanting. The film's cinematography and score add to the immersive experience and help to create a sense of awe and wonder that captivates the audience.However, while the film is a visual spectacle, some of the acting can be a bit off at times. While the younger cast members, particularly Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, give strong performances, some of the adult actors seem to struggle with their roles. Some of the line deliveries come across as stiff or forced, and some of the characters don't quite have the same depth as they do in the books.Despite these flaws, the world-building is what makes Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone a must-see film for fans of the franchise and newcomers alike. The film perfectly captures the essence of the Wizarding World and introduces the audience to the magic that makes the series so beloved.One of the most impressive aspects of the film is how it manages to stay true to the source material while still being accessible to a wider audience. The filmmakers did an excellent job of adapting J. K. Rowling's book for the big screen, and the film manages to capture the spirit of the story while also making some necessary changes for the cinematic format.Overall, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a great start to the beloved franchise. It sets the stage for the magical adventures to come and introduces us to a world full of wonder and enchantment. While the acting may not always be perfect, the film's world-building more than makes up for any shortcomings.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Mass Media and Chioldren Assignment: Kelly Mendoza,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the first movie in the Harry Potter series. Harry Potter, for those who have been living under a rock for ten years, is a highly successful series of novels for children. The protagonist, Harry, is a neglected eleven-year-old schoolboy in England who learns he is not a regular boy at all. In fact Harry Potter is a wizard. As if that wasn't shocking enough to learn on your eleventh birthday, Harry also discovers that he is not alone, there is a large hidden community of wizardry and magic that Harry will come to live in.The movie series created out of the novels, gives a visual touch to the bestselling books. Children who imagined what Harry's world looked like are given a stunning digital image of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Children have reacted to the Harry Potter series much like the children of the late seventies to early eighties reacted to Star Wars. Star Wars created a whole universe of aliens and spacecraft, which turned into a billion dollar empire of merchandise and licensing rights. Children fell in love with the Star Wars characters; toys and any other merchandise from that series were astonishingly successful.Just as Star Wars was its own universe of marketability, so is the young wizard's Harry Potter's world. Harry lives in England, but attends a secret wizardry school. He requires a magic wand, a robe, a cauldron, magic potions, a flying broom, and many schoolbooks. Not surprisingly, children in the real world can find all of these items as toys in their local toy store, without the magical powers of course. But just because Harry Potter is marketable is not why he is successful.Harry Potter's story speaks to the fantasies of all little children, He comes from a seemingly horrendous lifestyle to find out he is famous and powerful. Harry's parents died when he was an infant, his aunt and uncle raised him. They neglected him and only focused on their son Dudley, who was an overweight bully who only gained entertainment from torturing Harry. Harry was forced to live in a closet under the stairs. Harry was very alone. However, Harry soon gets what every child wants, after he discovers the truth of his past, he learns he is actually rich but didn't know it, and he attends school and finds friends and a group of people who love him.The movie has many lessons for young children. It preaches equality, acceptance, hard work, and stresses the importance of family. Harry must constantly study for his classes, which get increasingly harder. He befriends a boy who is from a large poor Irish wizard family, Ron Weasley, even though the rest of the community seems to mock the Weasley family. He also befriends a nerdy, brainy girl, Hermione Granger. But the biggest social moral running through the entire series is that of accepting others who maybe different.The wizarding world is locked in a hot debate over the education of witches and wizards. Magic skills are passed down from generation to generation, Harry's parents where very famous wizards who were murdered. Some witches and wizards are not the offspring of other magic folk. The magical children of wizards are described as ""pureblooded"". Many in the wizarding world wish to discriminate against those of who are not pure blood. They are referred to as ""mudbloods"", a derogatory term. Harry finds himself defending the ""mudblood"" children, namely his friend Hermione.Harry Potter does not only appeal to one gender. Even though the main character is a boy, it has been found that girls enjoy the series just as much if not more than boys. The issues Harry faces are universal to childhood. He longs for friendship and family and gets all of his wishes. A pure fantasy for many children, which is why they are so attracted to it. Harry defeats the bully; he becomes successful at sports, battles evil, and becomes a popular hero among his peers.Harry Potter is also a classic fantasy for children. Harry Potter is destined to battle the most evil wizard who ever lived; Lord Voldemort. Voldemort is responsible for the death of Harry's parents, and the deaths of many other good witches and wizards. Like with many children's films and stories, good and evil are clearly defined. Children can clearly rout for good to triumph evil.The film is not without its critics. Some in the Christian community do not like the series because to seems to promote an anti-Christian life-style. Some Christians object to teaching children about fantasy magic, paganism, and a society that does not worship Jesus. Even though in the movie the characters all celebrate Christmas.Overall I give the film an A-; there is not much in this film to be fearful of from the perspective of a parent. There is some fantasy violence, limited to magic beams emanating from wands. Children, can reenact the events in the film without any harm to anyone. The movie encourages children to work hard, play sports, and fight for equality. Children obviously love this series as it has been turned into a huge market empire. I would recommend it myself for anyone with children.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"It's good, but I loved the book too much to love it","The wonderful thing about a book is that you can sit down and linger over all your favorite parts of it. When I was not too much younger, I'd re-read my favorite scenes of children's books I loved over and over, savouring them. Here, it's all rushed. Sure, it's Harry Potter's greatest hits in complelation format, but I felt stunned, rushed and at the same time bored during the film. I wasn't awed. I wasn't thrilled. Except for a few brief moments, I generally sat there keeping up to pace and wondering how they'd do the scary scenes. (Those, and the Quiddich match, were wonderful and real movie savers) It's a nice little film, and perhaps if I was 14 or so I'd want to see it again, which is of course the point.

"It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live.","I went back to look at the two Chris Columbus-directed Harry Potter movies. These were the one that were more light fantasy and enjoyable in that light.Mr. Ollivander: Curious... very curious... Harry: Excuse me, sir, but what's curious? Mr. Ollivander: I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It just so happens that the phoenix whose tailfeather resides in your wand gave another... just one other. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand... when its brother gave you that scar. Harry: And who owned that wand? Mr. Ollivander: We do not speak his name! The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why. But I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things. Terrible! Yes. But great.This is the film that Harry discovers who he is. Others know more about him than he does. We are introduced to all the great characters that we have come to know and love: Daniel Radcliffe (with his clothes on), Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Maggie Smith, Tom Felton, and Robbie Coltrane, in particular.We see the spectacular art and set decorations, particularly in the Great hall by Stuart Craig (art director) and Stephanie McMillan (set decorator). Costune design by Judianna Makovsky and music by John Williams makes this a film to remember. The special effects were fantastic.With close supervision by author J.K.

Nicolas Flamel Strikes Again,"As the first of the famous Harry Potter films, this one managed to restrain its special effects sufficiently not to overwhelm the viewers with too many dazzling visuals at the expense of the story and the amusing characters. The result is most entertaining, and Emma Watson was perfectly cast as the character Hermione. The production is full of famous actors, some recognisable, some not. Robbie Coltrane is particularly effective and endearing, with a broad Somerset accent, of all things! Maggie Smith has little to do but wrinkle her nose. But there is little point in discussing a production which has been reviewed to death and talked about until everyone has lost their breath, and there is nothing to add about all that. In America, this film title used the phrase 'sorcerer's stone' because Americans were presumably considered too ill-educated to know what the Philosopher's Stone is. In Britain and Canada, the title used the correct phrase of 'the Philosopher's Stone'. The Philosopher's Stone (correctly shown in the film as being red in colour) is reputed to have existed, but no one is certain. It was the end-product of alchemy, and had the ability to turn all metals into gold if you sprinkled a little of it on, say, lead, for instance. It also could produce a medicine to allow you to live indefinitely in good health, perhaps for centuries. J. K. Rowling sticks some genuine esoterica into her stories sometimes, and in this one she incorporated the fourteenth century alchemist Nicolas Flamel, whose presumed dates are sometimes given as 1330-1418. He really existed, and his tombstone may be seen in the Musee de Cluny in Paris, on the left as you go up a staircase, affixed to a wall. The staff of the Museum either do not know or pretend not to know who Flamel is, and 'if ye seek ye shall not find', as they all look blank. As far as I know, I may be the only person who has fully deciphered the symbology of this strange stone. Flamel faked his own death to avoid arrest and imprisonment by the French king, who wanted to keep him captive and force him to make gold for him. The tombstone was designed by Flamel himself before he disappeared. For a long time it rested in place in the nave of the Paris church of Saint-Jacques la Boucherie, but that church was demolished long ago, with only its high tower remaining. The Tour Saint-Jacques has now had its scaffolding removed, and is looking splendid and clean. It has long been the symbol of modern French esotericism (which the French call esoterisme), and a famous French esoteric periodical even bore its name. The tombstone was salvaged from the demolition and used for many years, turned upside-down, as a chopping-board for herbs, by a herb-seller in his shop. It was recognised in the 19th century and preserved by an antiquary. The old stone house of Flamel, known as 'the oldest house in Paris', still stands and you can go and eat there in a small and expensive restaurant called after Flamel. There are even two little streets in the vicinity of the Tour named Rue Nicolas Flamel and Rue Perenelle, the latter of which is named for his wife and alchemical collaborator. In the film, Flamel is said still to be alive, and the Stone is his, although he does not appear in the story himself. What happened to Flamel, who was Fulcanelli, all of these things are continuing mysteries which are far more interesting than any J. K. Rowling story. Nevertheless, it is good that young people are being given a small dose of these things in palatable form by Rowling, as it might open their minds, if they can stop texting trivia to each other for long enough to allow their minds to be opened, that is.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
It was awesome.,"Draco Malfoy wasn't in it that much(which sucked). He makes the movie. I think Malfoy should be in it more. (HE IS SO HOT!).

A big disappointment,"I was so disappointed with this movie. The first part of the movie before Harry gets to Hogwarts was just terrible! If I hadn't read the book, it would not have made any sense. Crucial scenes were cut out so that there was no transition, and the acting was weak. The changes between really dark scenes and really bright scenes were not well done either. The Dursleys were not as I had imagined them to be, especially Mr. Dursley. The casting of the Weasleys (except for Ron) was just downright wrong. The twins fun, happy-go-luckyness, and humour were not captured - the lines that were supposed to be funny were delivered without conviction, and the twins became dull barely existent characters.I really liked Harry, Hermione, and especially Ron. McGonagall was good too, but Dumbledore was not characterized very well - he didn't show his friendly wise side well.The second half of the movie improved, but it wasn't enough. The movie lacked good focus and pacing. The adaptation from book to movie failed. The movie attempted to follow the book almost exactly while keeping the length down so that the result was a choppy movie. For example, in one scene it has Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Hagrid watching the dragon hatch. The next scene was Hagrid, unconvincingly, saying that the dragon was taken away - no explanation, and if it wasn't for the fact that Hagrid getting the dragon egg was important to the plot, it would have been a scene with absolutely no importance. I wasn't looking for every scene to be included in the movie but important scenes that explained the story should not have been left out.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Very great and exciting.,"I think it was very good, but I think that people might think it's better if they have read the book.

But other than that I though it was a great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Happy Potter and the Sorcerers stone- no magic for me,"I am probably one in a minority when I say that I do not like Harry Potter. I thought it was overlong and a tad bit boring, it was however funny in places. I also liked the quote at the end where Harry says ""I am not going home not really"". Harry Potter was released alongside Lord of the Ring, I saw both I preferred LOTR. I don't however hate all of the Harry Potter films, I thought the Prisoner of Azkaban was good and so was the Goblet of fire.This is a movie aimed at kids. They will be blown away by the magic and the action. I think I would have had a different view if I saw it when I was a child. Like for instance Star Wars is heavily criticized these days but I saw it as a child and I was blown away, for me it is a bit of nostalgia. Harry Potter provided no magic for me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
It was a great film with awsome acting!,"This was a great movie.  It was 2 1/2 hours long but deffinatly worth every bit.   The acting was superb and Daniel Radcliffe portrayed a perfect Harry Potter.  This film  was true to the book.  The Hogwarts castle was cool. It looked so misterious and wizard like(well duh)  They did a wonderful job with customs and every thing else.  For all the Harry Potter fans,  It will be something you should not miss!!!!!

Not a perfect movie (at least for those who haven't read the book),"OK, for starters, this movie was fun and entertaining, but mostly due to the special effects and the acting efforts of the veterans (and because of the director, Chris Columbus: ""Home Alone"", anyone?). The story wasn't so trimmed, so I'm grateful to that (maybe because the book wasn't as long as the later ones, mind you), but the one thing that annoyed me most was the acting of the children, especially Rupert Grint and Emma Watson.Of course, they were just beginners, and Daniel Radcliffe's performance wasn't bad at all, since he already had some experience in ""David Copperfield"". Grint and Watson over did it, I think: Grint was too nervous, and Watson was too snobbish (Hermione wasn't that snobbish in the book), although her looks always remind me of a friend of mine in university. But all in all, and I have to be serious, I'd say that both the performances of (especially) Grint and Watson were worthy of Razzie nominations (of course, if black children had done better jobs in a different film, they'd have WON the Razzies, since we live in that kind of world), but the only reason they weren't nominated was the fact that it was a Harry Potter movie.Good story, great special effects, mediocre acting from the children, but great acting from the adults (Alan Rickman's Oscar is ridiculously overdue now). 6 out of 10 stars.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Good but not great: Chris Columbus isn't pushing the envelope,"Readers seem pleased that the movie seldom strays from the book. Steven Kloves' screenplay seems to be a transcription of J.K. Rowling's first Harry Potter novel. Unfortunately, this means that some adult viewers might be glancing at their watches as the movie slowly resolves the plot. I noticed that the film's length posed no problem for older children in the theater when I saw it. (The kids seemed to know the story, so there probably weren't many surprises for them.)  I must commend the screenwriter for doing his best with Rowling's major plot twist -- which I had found a bit awkward when I read the novel.I believe the story is character-driven rather than plot-driven, so the mystery is less important to me than the characters' arcs. I also believe that the story's wizardry is a MacGuffin. It's more important for us to see Harry, Ron and Hermione discover the value of friendship and loyalty than learn spells and potions.In his earlier movies, Chris Columbus demonstrates a knack for working with children, so I'm not surprised that Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint give excellent performances. (BTW, I am NEVER forgiving toward bad child actors.) Harry, Ron and Hermione must be likable and believable, and they are. Without the convincing work by this trio, the great performances by the stellar British cast would not have been enough to carry the movie.If the rest of films in this series are of this caliber, they should be popular for years to come.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Book-lovers will be excited to see it all come to life,"When a beloved book is given the big-screen treatment, there's always the excitement factor of getting to see what was once only in your head come to life right before your eyes. That excitement was 100-fold, however, with J.K. Rowling's smash-hit fantasy series beginning with ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone."" With that much anticipation, there are some serious expectations for Warner Brothers' behemoth franchise-to-be, and gladly the pay-off of seeing it all for the first time makes ""Sorcerer's Stone"" a success with Potter fans.As for those who never picked up the book, there might be a good portion among them who aren't left spellbound. The enormous project suffers a bit out of fear of failing the fans, which is fair as they're the target audience -- along with families in general. That's where the choice for Chris Columbus to produce and direct becomes the level-headed choice. With credits including both ""Home Alone"" films and ""Mrs. Doubtfire,"" Columbus clearly knows how to work with kids -- and there is a lot of that work needing to be done with young actors Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson taking most of the screen time. All three are quite talented for having barely a credit to their names and Columbus deserves much of the praise for their performance.The rest of the cast is pretty remarkable: a who's who of outstanding British acting (and some Scottish). Richard Harris as Dumbledore, Maggie Smith as Professor McGonnagal, Richard Griffiths as Uncle Vernon, John Hurt as Mr. Olivander, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid and Alan Rickman who is brilliantly chilling as the mean, stone-faced Professor Snape. Each of them clearly talented enough to bring these characters to life not just visually but with complexity. They are like the respected elders of the film and we bow our heads to them.At the same time, the first Harry Potter is a much more childish film full of good vs. evil cliché. Maybe the attribution should go to the desire to not get slapped with anything more than a PG rating, which is understandable, but it dilutes the mystique of the novels. The art direction (with lavish sets and costumes) makes the film carry its own magical quality just like the book, but it's the dramatic storytelling that's not as breath-taking.Part of that problem belongs to the challenge of adapting the book. Steve Kloves (""Wonder Boys"") proves an interesting choice, but I wouldn't wish this assignment on anyone. Kloves opts for taking the maximum time producers would give him (two and a half hours -- too much for a family film) and crams as much book material as he can into it. Not exactly the best way to do it, but the safest as far as fan-pleasing goes. ""Sorcerer's Stone"" ends up vaulting from scene to scene and the result is that Harry goes from boy who didn't know wizards existed to wizard student with the knowledge that strangers wouldn't just carry dragon eggs in about an hour and a half. The story still gives Harry time to charm us and express his fears and wishes to know his parents, but his hero's journey is undermined by sheer desire to fill the screen with as many magical elements from the book as possible.""Sorcerer's Stones"" will certainly satisfy fans' itches and entertain them at a high level of quality, which I can say falling into that category, but it's a bit too much like a really long race because of its commitment to book obedience (and I'm sure plenty was missing too). But seeing it all come to life is enough to entertain the masses and provoke the imaginations of nearly all who sit down and watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
EVERYONE SHOULD SEE THIS FILM!! (Or read the books!),"All I can say about this film is - ITS BRILLIANT!! I'm probably biased though because I've read all the books 4 times each but I have to say that the film was very true to the books and about as close as you could get in 2 and a 1/2 hours.Also HOW THE HELL IS THAT FILM A PG?! Anyone under the age of 11 would get nightmares - hell, some bits frightened me and I'm 15!

I'm more Hermione than she will ever be. She doesn't even look like her let alone act like her!

3 AMAZING scenes makes a worth watching.,"I'll say it plainly - this film was simply a visual imitation of the book. No more, no less.The actors were all wonderful (except that Radcliffe kid who was HORRIBLE) - Rupert Grint as Ron was the best, Emma Watson as Hermione was charming, and of course all the masters of British theater - Maggie Smith the goddess, Robbie Coltrane, Richard Harris (delightful!), John Hurt, the genius Fiona Shaw as Mss. Dursly and the greatest Alan Rickman... Except that kid who played Potter there is no complaining. Everyone has a part that's perfect for him\her.The design was dazzling - I was amazed for seeing it on the screen was EXACTLY how I imagined it - the platform, the alley, the mines in the bank... The forest, and Hagrid's home... All was just beautiful, like being inside a dream. But there was something missing - the film didn't want to go beyond visualizing the book. It was boring, and slow, filled with many gaps in the script, and many annoying scenes, and if it wasn't to that hysteria all around in it, I'd dare say it's a bad film. It lacked the wittiness and dark humor that filled the books  the criticizing of English morals, and of the capitalist, merchandized culture of the modern world, a culture of which the Harry Potter phenomena long became a part.But there are no words to describe the magic, for it was a truly a magical film, and that was mostly seen in 3 scenes that no matter how many flaws there are in this movie, these scenes were amazing. The Sorting Hat was very impressing, the face of Voldmort appearing on this guy's face was truly terrifying (and definitely not suitable for children!!!), and the unbelievable, paralyzing, divine scene of the Quiddich - the only reason I'll go watch it again. It was so realistic, and so eroding, and so beautiful, it kept me staring at the screen without being aware to what's really happening. It was the photography, and the music, and the editing, and of course the works of visual effects that gave me the same feeling that I had when I watched `Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon'  a true katarzis, a true triumph of cinema over all other arts. It was the one scene in the film that made me think  hell, no book can describe something so stunningly. And I love books, and I found J. K. Rolling's description of the game in the book sweeping and wonderful, but the scene in the movie was, as only the 2 other scenes I mentioned earlier, truly superior to the writing.Anyway, this film is a wonderful way to pass time, and a delightful way to marvel the capabilities of digital effects. As for more than that  I'd hope the first Lord Of The Rings film won't disappoint me. Not that I am much disappointed by ""Harry Potter"" because I didn't except much  it was directed by Chris Columbus who usually deals with children movies, so I'd knew it would be childish and not a bit sophisticated. That is what I expected it to be. I just hope that the next movie, as the second book, will have more to offer than this one had.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

It moves magnificently across the screen like an unstoppable force.It is never easy to make a film where children act the lead roles but Director Christopher Columbus achieves it with elegance and style.The characters of Hermione, Ron and, of course, Harry, were all brilliantly cast, as was the entire rest of the film -- especially Alan Rickman as Professor Severus Snape.  Wonderful faces and true characters just from the look of the actors.No amount of screen time or set element is too small; the attention to detail is superb and the overall feel' of the film evokes the magic and sense of awe and wonder that it should.It is magnificently photographed.  The scenes at Alnwick Castle in Northumberland, in the U.K. could not have been a better location -- it is truly wondrous.The score by the master of film music, John Williams, is haunting and plaintive when it should be and stirring, robust and inspiring when the scene calls for it.The special effects are genius: worked into the story and adding to it but never detracting from it.  This is after all a story about magic!The lighting was inspired: the perfect interplay of light and shadow leaving just the right touch to the imagination; and in one scene when a character says It all became blackness' the screen flashes to white.This is a film as much for adults as it is for children: there are some scary parts and some ironic humour and some clever word play.All in all Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is going to be one of the classics of filmmaking; I can't wait for the sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

"The first and weakest - but still rather good - ""Harry Potter"" movie.","As with the books, the movies seem to get better as they progress, so of the two ""Harry Potter"" movies currently released (the third is shortly forthcoming), this is the weakest.It suffers mainly from some dodgy acting from child actors, at times weak special effects, and a screenplay trying to cram too much of the book's contents into the movie.However it's still an above-average attempt with some wonderful set-pieces, magical moments and a fantastic older cast.In fact one of the best things about the movie is its cast including the late great Richard Harris, the wonderful Maggie Smith, a very Hagrid-like Robbie Coltrane, and a great turn from a genuinely smarmy Alan Rickman who is a superb Snape. Also good support from Fiona Shaw as a smirking Aunt Petunia, John Hurt as Mr. Ollivander, John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick, Ian Hart as Quirrell, and Julie Walters as a delightful Mrs. Weasley.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Euro centricity,"So you're tired of all those kids reporting on the disappointment of seeing their imagination violated when transformed on the big screen by techno-geeks. My son refuses to go because he doesn't want to ruin his vision of this modern classic. Good, but since I couldn't get out from under the staircase in Book 1, I really have nothing to lose.Aside form the technical wizardry - did I see that sorting ceremony hat in ""A Nightmare Before Christmas""? - costumes - I want that cloak of invisibility -  score - wait, what score? -  this film has its way with the audience incorporating all the escapism we all need.  But this is a fantasy that relegates almost anyone who isn't traditional British white bread to minor roles like sports announcer, Centaur or walk on.  Dare I ask author J.K. Rowlings or director Chris Columbus to bend towards diversity and give us a picture of even those reality-based British suburbia with a touch of multi-culturalism? Or is that too heavy a dose of reality.The kids are cute and their parts well acted. The story moves and we find ourselves caring for Harry, Ron and Hermione. Did the casting director really look for an Opie look-alike for Harry's hapless sidekick Ron? Harry's muggle family was a little over the top  but the plot-twists were well executed.  It was pleasant to see the solid assortment of English performers who even in cameo roles gave solid performances.  But are they all Caucasians?What to watch for? There's a great shot of the inner-works of a lock on the vault holding the sorcerer's stone.  The opening scene bridges reality and fantasy very well. The troll trashing the girl's toilet must have been based on memories from secondary education. And Harry's wand selection sequence makes me long for the day that merchants knew their wares.The night before Harry Potter's opening, Steve Martin appeared on the David Letterman show to hype his new film ""Novocain.""

The magic has truly begun,"After reading all of J.K Rowling's excellent Harry Potter books, I was a little unsure about what to expect from the film. It is so very hard to convey the essence and vitality of a book to the big screen. Little did I know that I was in for a massive and rather pleasent surprise.The splendour of the locations as described in the book were translated so very well to the movie - one could not help but be astounded by Hogwarts, it's grounds and the Forbidden Forest. The use of CGI in the film was well balanced, effective and warranted.But of course, 'smoke and mirrors' can only do so much to enhance a film. The 'magic' truly comes from the actors and actresses who portray those so vital roles. The casting staff need to be given full credit; I cannot think of any one more suited to the roles than those who were cast for them. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were absolutely spectacular, words are insufficient to lavish the amount of praise upon them that is necessary to convey my feelings. Harry, Ron and Hermione leapt from the book and onto the screen in their form. Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltraine, Richard Harris and Alan Rickman must be praised for their portrayal of the Hogwarts Faculty, each as stunning as each other, the spirit of the book must have truly flowed throughout the film set during Filming.My only critique if any was that there were not enough scenes with the Aforementioned faculty. However, Daniel, Rupert and Emma certainly shone with such a light that it was only after I had thought about the film in retrospect that I developed this 'critique'.A whole hearted 10 out of 10 goes to this film, and deservedly so.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

I am really glad that they cast an all British cast, since the books are all taking place in the UK (or at Hogwarts) ;). What I especially loved about the casting was that the three main characters were all newcomers to the screen. Daniel Radcliffe was BRILLIANT as Harry Potter. I cannot think of another actor who could bring him to life. Rupert Grint was great as Ron. I loved all of his expressions. :) And Emma Watson is great as Hermione (spelling?).As for the professors, the late Richard Harris was an excellent choice for Dumbledore. Maggie Smith seems as if she was meant for the part. Alan Rickman was born to play Professor Snape...he was really scary at times!

From the moment Hagrid appears it really kicks off and gets better and better with very memorable moments as such as the quidditch game and the chess match at the end, rivaling Goonies' best moments.

"Faithful to the book, disappointing to watch.","I don't consider myself a huge Harry Potter fan - still, I've read all the books and enjoyed them a great lot. I was quite anxious to see how well was the atmosphere of the books translated to the big screen. I'm sorry to join the displeased side, but the movie IS disappointing - to say the least.Its main asset seems to be the way all the familiar locations are portrayed - Diagon Alley, Gringotta Bank, platform 9 and 3/4, finally the majestic Hogwarts itself are all visually stunning and wonderfully brought to life. I have no complaints about actors' performances either - with Emma Watson as Hermione, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid and Alan Rickman as Snape doing particularly well.Alas, for the rest of the movie... Following the original story it is - logical it is not. There are far too many bits missing to make it sensible. Where's the constant competition of the houses? How come Snape doesn't take points from Gryffindor on every occasion? Why is Malfoy nearly absent throughout? What's the point of having Crabbe and Goyle or the centaur appear on the screen if they have absolutely nothing to do there? I couldn't even see any mention of Professor McGonagall being the head of the Gryffindor House! And most of all - where has the Snape's potion riddle gone? It makes the entire ending feel incomplete and unsatisfying.While I realize it's plain impossible to transcript ALL the details from the book, many humorous ones COULD have been included if it hadn't been for the irritating exploding wands gags, Neville's broomstick exploits or some overdrawn conversations. Even the great scene in Olivander's wand shop was rewritten and ruined for a bunch of cheap chuckles.And to all those saying the effects were great - where have you guys been for the last couple of years? I mean, c'mon! The quidditch match is way too fast and chaotic - makes me wonder what are they going to do when it's time to shoot the World Cup match in ""Goblet of Fire"", which is supposed to be played MUCH FASTER than anything Harry had ever seen! At the same time the effects are lousy, including the most obvious blue screens I've seen in months and flying broomsticks that make ""Back To The Future Part II"" look top notch in comparison - and that's a 1989 title, mind you. The troll was laughable and shrekish to the point of incredulousness. The stiff dummy pretending to be Neville falling off the broomstick was embarrassing. And since ""Forrest Gump"" there's hardly anything impressive about a feather hovering in mid-air.The camerawork is merely average. Having seen how splendid the castle of Hogwarts looks from outside I expected the same kind of grandeur inside. Sadly, apart from the few scenes in the Great Hall, they never manage to convey the sheer size of the place. And excuse me, was that supposed to be the dreary dank dungeon where the potions classes took place? Give me a break.All in all - an big effort, but with half its potential lost somewhere on the way. Could have been so much more. This - 6/10, tops.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

moments of magic and imagination make this a superior movie,"Overshadowed by the Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring when it was first released, this opening entry in the Harry Potter franchise is quirky, magical, and full of charm. Daniel Radcliffe, as Potter, shines as the boy wizard just beginning to realise his potential and his fate.Special effects are memorable - the constant stream of letters luring Harry to Hogwarts, the snake pit, the colour changes of house colours, the game of Quiddich. And the acting is stellar from veterans Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman, and Richard Harris (when comparing his Dumbledore to Michael Gambon's it would have been fascinating to see both actors tackle the character at all stages in the series to see how their interpretations would develop; sadly Harris died after film two, necessitating a cast change).Not as stunning as LOTR, nevertheless there is plenty in the first Harry Potter to interest adults and delight children.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A great start to a magical series,"I have not read any of the Harry Potter books and until now had not seen any of the films, and also tbh it's not a series I really know much about - so I went into this film pretty much completely blind. I have to say that it is really entertaining, and I would have loved it if it had come out when I was a kid. Following an 11yo Harry as he discovers that he is a wizard, it's off to wizard school he goes and we are treated to a collection of interesting teachers, fantastic beasts, moving staircases and secrets aplenty. With an engaging plot and great characters, this is a film that is extremely hard to dislike. I look forward to watching the rest...",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"A Solid Start, but flawed story.","Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone is an ok movie to start a love action phenomenon.The story of this movie (which i won't spell out every time as i like my fingers in stable condition) is absolutely mediocre. There are many times in this movie i felt characters (especially Harry and his friends) pulled stuff out of their backsides. Harry, Hermione and Ron were like Sherlock Holmes with the amount they seem to gather through the events of the movie. They rarely deduct anything and always know exactly what is happening at any given moment. For children who are playing children in the movie this is stupid. Harry Potter maybe famous in this world but it doesn't make him a super genius, especially as he didn't know anything until very recently. The same (besides the final part) goes to Ron and Hermione. The ending was pretty poor i believe and the reveals throughout the movie are pretty meh (although i like one at the end of the movie... kinda). The lore that is presented in this movie is fine but nothing special. I have not read the books thus do not know how much they remove and/or add. But the story whether more original or not was average at best, but i felt it was mediocre. The script was just not very good in my eyes and it doesn't make me want to read the books at all. This being said i am not at all a reader.The cast was absolutely fine. Daniel was actually my least favourite out of the main three in terms of acting but still did a splendid job of portraying Harry Potter, (this obviously coming from someone who hasn't read the novels). Emma was really good considering she was only ten years old at the time. I really enjoyed her performance in this movie and though she did a better job than our protagonist. Rupert was good too, he was right in the middle for me in terms of acting. Better than Daniel but not as good as Emma. Obviously i myself am not an actor thus this is a untrained persons opinion however i feel it is accurate.My favourite of the rest of the cast i difficult. I feel my favourites were both Maggie Smith and the late Alan Rickman. Both of which i really enjoyed the performances of. Nobody in the cast (form Dumbledore to Malfoy) was bad and actually this movie is very good in this aspect. I though Malfoy's character was actually pretty good. The whole movie didn't have a case of bad acting in sight it seemed. The worst for me was Neville Longbottom's character, however it was played by a child as well and wasn't really bad or anything. Just not as good as his young counterparts.CGI for a 2001 movie is good. Nothing exceptionally excellent , however it is actually pretty good in this movie it has to be said. The magic was fine and the paintings in the background were excellently done. In vain with this i also liked a lot (if not most) of the set design. Hogwarts and just the world in general looked pretty good. It felt believable to a certain extent and nothing felt majorly out of place for what we were told.Story - 4/10Cast - 8/10CGI - 6.5/10World Design - 6.5/10Overall this Harry Potter and the Philosophers (or Sorcerer's) Stone was a movie that had a great cast but had a poor script and a mediocre story at best.Decent little movie to start off this live-action adaptation, 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
An awesome movie! I love you Sean Biggerstaff!,"I loved Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone! Sean Biggerstaff (Oliver Wood) was packin some major heat! Not only are Harry, Ron, Hermione, Draco, Neville, Dudley, Seamus and all the rest of the child actors  adorable but they are incredible actors as well. The older cast was awesome too! I loved the sets and the special effects. I can't wait to see the rest of the movies and more of these actors in other places too. It is a long movie but I was captivated the whole time and I can't wait to see this movie again and again (I've already seen it twice)! I know I don't have the right to tell you to go see this movie so all I'll say is if you look interested, then definitely go see it. You won't be disappointed. And read the books!

Great adaptation but ordinary film,Not having read Harry Potter I thought this was a very ordinary movie. It seems to be a combination of so many other films and books - particularly British children's fiction - that there's nothing outstanding or original about it. Probably the best thing about it is the set and the locations that they found - except Kings Cross station of course! The children are a bit stiff in their acting but it was good to see that it hadn't been made into some awful homogenised Hollywood schmaltz. I am sure it'll earn a billion but only because the books have been so successful.Definitely one for avid fans or those yet to reach puberty.,7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
This movie has a great blend of entertaining and fascinating characters and takes place in a vast and unpredictable universe,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001) is a movie I recently watched with my daughter on HBOMAX. The storyline follows an orphaned young man with a strange mark on his forehead who lives with his aunt, uncle and cousin. One day he is informed that he is special and is destined to attend a special school for those with magic. He is whisked off to a world like he could never imagine where he will quickly discover that he is a destined to be a savior for everyone with magic...This movie is directed by Chris Columbus (Rent) and stars Daniel Radcliffe (Horns), Maggie Smith (Gosford Park), Rupert Grint (Moonwalkers), Warwick Davis (Willow), Verne Troyer (Austin Powers), John Hurt (Aliens) and Emma Watson (Beauty and the Beast).The universe, magic and characters are very well established in this movie. The cast is awesome and perfectly selected to deliver these unique and fascinating characters. The mystery of Harry's past creates a level of intensity and unpredictably in every circumstance. The school layout and games are depicted brilliantly with great CGI and special effects. The final conclusion was well delivered and helped build the comradery between characters they'll need in the following film.This movie has a great blend of entertaining and fascinating characters and takes place in a vast and unpredictable universe. This is an absolute must see that I would score a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Who let Columbus destroy a great story?,"The industry chiefs need to get this through their heads:  Chris Columbus is not good at book adaptations.  Look what he did to Asimov's Bicentennial Man.  Now he's gone and done the same to HP.  1 out of 10 here, for what should have been 10.The book is a quarter of the way through before Harry encounters Hagrid, yet in the film the title sequence is barely over.  The viewer loses sight of the fact that he is mistreated at home.Similarly, several other turning points in the story are just not in the film.If you haven't seen it yet - don't bother.

Redefines 10,"Before this weekend, I gave only 4 movies (of over 200) an IMDB rating of 10. Except for Shrek and One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest, I will downgrade the others to 9 (and some 9s down to 8, etc.). That's a bit of work, but The Sorceror's Stone is that kind of movie.Beyond that, the only rave that I can add to all the others is I have never before watched a movie that so duplicated what I had imagined when I read the book. Of all the characters including the minor ones, only Harry's mother was not exactly as I had imagined them. Even then when I reread the novel's description of her, I discovered my imagination had been in error, not the movie.Harry Potter fans who are skipping the movie so that it won't cloud their own personal visions are truly doing themselves a grave injustice.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

'Twas Alright,"After hearing of all the records it came near to or broke, I was disappointed after watching it. The hype surrounding the movie caused me to go out and read the book. After reading it, I thought the movie would be great, but....it was just the book on screen. Not much to it, they used exact lines, etc. Lord of the Rings was based on the book, but it was so much better... Maybe it's because this movie was directed towards kids, but the movie was just boring. I didn't find the three-headed dog or wizard chess as exciting as it was in the book.

"Visually nice, but too long","The main problem with this movie is that it is too long. It is too faithful to the book. The moviemakers seemed reluctant to streamline the plot and pick up the pace. The video I rented recently contained two scenes (after the ending credits) which had been cut from the movie.  Both were good cuts, neither needed to be in the movie.  More scenes should have been cut.That said, the movie is beautiful. All of the effects (except the 3 headed dog) are well done. There are lots of great sequences, such as the entry into Hogwarts, the first flying lesson, and the Quidich match. The ending sequence, with the series of puzzles is a little disappointing, but only because it doesn't really live up to the earlier scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
(7) A truly enjoyable fantasy film,"Somehow, I had missed joining in on the phenomenon that was HARRY POTTER. I had not read any of the books and missed most of the hype preceding the film. In fact, I hadn't even seen the trailer. So it was with the healthy anticipation that I generally have for the movies I choose to see that I bought my ticket and entered the cinema where I would be transported into a world that returned me to the fantasies of my childhood. I have since read the books and come to understand some of the gripes of the many purists who have lamented some of the changes in the film. But despite some of these (fully justified) complaints, this film will see me return for several further viewings.HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE captured my imagination from the first shots of Dumbledore as he douses the lights in Privet Drive until the camera pulls back in the final shots of the Hogwart Express taking the young wizards- and witches-in-training back for  their holiday after a busy term at Hogwarts. The film takes great care in creating the magical world to which Harry travels and the characters that inhabit that these fantastic places are beautifully brought to life by a set of actors who serve this film in no uncertain terms.Of the child actors, Rupert Grint fares the best as the irrepressible Ron Weasly. His work in the film perfectly balances the delightfully waspish Emma Watson as Hermione Granger and the delicate work of Daniel Radcliffe as the title character. Some have criticised Radcliffe's work as a trifle bland: however, I feel this may have been a conscious choice on the part of the director Chris Columbus in the creation of a central everyman character with whom audiences can identify and onto whom they may graft their own personalities, dreams, wishes and fantasies. The other youthful characters' roles are greatly reduced from the book, most lamentably Neville Longbottom, whose arc in the book was truly touching, and Draco Malfoy, who does little more here than establish himself as a nemesis to the Potter/Granger/Weasly trio. The other regretted loss is Hermione's, robbing her of her climactic moment in the challenges that face the friends as they decode a series of charms in their quest for the sorcerer's stone. The adult cast is uniformly brilliant, with a Gandalfian Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, a suitably strict Minerva McGonagall in Maggie Smith and a perfectly slimy Alan Rickman as Professor Snape. Robbie Coltrane is outstanding as Rubeus Hagrid.The film and my subsequent reading of the books have turned me into a HARRY POTTER fan. Like everyone else, I anticipate the fifth book impatiently and can't wait for the next film. I can't help wondering however how major the sacrifices in the subsequent films will be. Certainly, the third and fourth books should not be crammed into the  comparatively miniscule two and a half hours that was able to serve the first film extremely well. All I hope for with each subsequent film is a journey into the magical world that captured me so brilliantly in what is the finest fantasy film I have seen in many years.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

"very, very poor","I can't believe I waited in line for half an hour to see this. As a film student I take this as an insult to the industry. The child actors are terrible (especially the over-acting hermoine), the story could have been adapted for film (not just taken straight from the book) and the for such a big budget movie the special effects were terrible. But what's worst about the film is the fact that it has attracted so many adults. You know something is wrong with the world when adults are discussing quittich instead of any number of slightly intelligent topics. Still it is a children's film, not a work of art and at the end of the day the kids will be rushing in a mindless throng to see the next film. The filmmaker's have compromised the integrity of the industry in favour of stealing children's money (or at least their parent's money). And to think the world has to endure six more potter outings.

Great children's fantasy,"Chris Columbus has mostly directed movies for the whole family. His imprint is clear. The first Harry Potter movie is clearly a very childlike fantasy. It's mostly aimed for children, and no one's trying to hide it. Sure, people of all ages can watch it, and the book isn't just meant for kids, but the movie is just so clearly meant for children, which can make it slightly annoying. But it's fascinating to see how that changes when the series goes on. The movies change a lot considering their target audience was growing up the whole time, and they eventually look like a dark young adult fantasy instead of this colourful fantasy for children..This first movie adaptation annoys me so much. They've followed the book closely, some lines are straight from the book. Yet so much is missing. So many important details are gone. Of course not everything can make it to the film but still it bothers many viewers who have read the books. Also even if the movie is long it seems to happen so fast.It's an entertaining movie but after so any years they lose some of their magic. It's sad, of course, but it's mostly the fault of the audience (in this case, me) and not the movies.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

A very faithful adaptation - perhaps too faithful.,"The Harry Potter books are only the single most popular children's stories in existence - most children under the age of thirteen (and a good chunk of adults as well) can recite the books verbatim. Drawing from fantasy literature and owing quite a debt to earlier writers such as Roald Dahl, J.K. Rowling made her stories about Harry the Wizard into a phenomenon. It's been a merchandising groundswell, a boon to children's literature, and a godsend to parents everywhere.  What could be better than having your child dive into a 300+ page book for hours on end?  Why, making those books into movies, of course.  No pressure.The trickiest thing about adapting a book to a film is striking the balance between what works on paper and what works on screen.  Time is a natural restriction: a book has as long as it needs to describe the setting and the events and can delve into as much detail as the author deems necessary.  The reader can always put the book down and start up again another time, after all.  A movie, on the other hand, is a one-sitting event. Because of this, it needs to be more concerned about not overwhelming the viewer.  When transferring a book to the screen, things are usually streamlined, details (and sometimes characters) are omitted, and the end result is usually a reinvention of the original story.'Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone' doesn't reinvent the book it's based on.  It copies it almost word for word to the screen.  Almost nothing is left out, virtually no event is ignored, and the result is a dense film that runs two-and-a-half hours and is virtually indistinguishable from the book. If you've read the book, you've seen the movie.  So the question is, was this the right decision?It's a matter of taste, and the backlash on cutting anything from the original story probably would have been marketing suicide, but it definitely affects the film in terms of pacing.  While one of the beauties of reading a story like Harry Potter lies in unraveling the details of this new and strange world over the course of the school year, watching the same thing is a much different experience.  In an effort to show you as much as possible about the world Harry now lives in, it walks a very tight line between marvel and overload.  If it weren't the most popular book in the world, a tighter film probably would have been made.That said, 'Sorceror's Stone' is still a beautiful film to watch.  The set design of Hogwart's School is breathtaking.  Every corner hides a little bit of magical (and computer-generated) trickery.  Most of the effects are seamlessly done, with a few minor exceptions (mostly involving wide-angles of flying broomsticks).  It's a bit overdone at times, with the swelling score by John Williams and the panning shots of the school and the main hall - but that's the point.  Hogwart's is a realm of magic and mystery, and is always presented as larger than life.Casting is critical to a budding franchise like this one, and in general, 'Sorceror's Stone' gets it right.  The kids, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson) drive the entire story, so they are key.  All are good choices and seem up for the roles, but Radcliffe and Watson don't quite seem comfortable just yet.  Grint, for his part as the lovable loser Ron Weasley, nearly steals the show every time he's on screen - he's got just the right balance of whimsy and mischief mixed with his humble down-home origins.For the adults, the best castings are Richard Harris as Dumbledore (just right in his wizened expertise, always with a sparkle in his eye that says he knows far more than anyone else does), Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid (the loyal lummox with a heart as big as he is), and best of all, Alan Rickman as Professor Snape (who utters every word, even the most benign, while oozing sinister menace.  He's delightful.).  Maggie Smith as Professor MacGonagall is also excellent, just as Maggie Smith always is.This is first in a series, and as such involves a huge amount of exposition and explanation.  The entire film is consumed with who Harry is, why he's important, what's going on with all these wizards, and opening doors that will be explored in later episodes.  This means characters are introduced that don't do much of anything - yet. (Ginny Weasley and Nearly-Headless Nick, to name two.)  This means that the plot surrounding the Sorceror's Stone is necessarily thin.  This also means, that if the film (and book before it) has done its job, you'll be back for more when the next ones arrive.  On that note, 'Sorceror's Stone' succeeds wonderfully in bringing to life this delightful story of the boy who was a wizard and the remarkable world that invites him in.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"The book is okay, the movie however...","While I am extremely bothered by the mass hysteria surrounding the Harry Potter franchise I will comment only on the film and book.  When reading the book I found it to be highly enjoyable, above average children's literature. The film however,is below average filth that is making more money than it should and therefore telling Hollywood it's okay to put out an inferior product like this.  The great adult actors couldn't even save this movie from bad directing.  Suffice it to say that after I awoke for the second time during the movie (having fallen asleep twice) I realized that if I had not previously read the novel I wouldn't have the slightest idea as to why things were happening the way they were.  In the end Chris Columbus takes a slightly above average book and makes a movie that, if called mediocre, would be receiving excessive praise.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Great start,"I came to these movies totally oblivious to the books. I have not read a page of any of the novels. With that, my critique of these films is purely on the cinema. I had not previously added my thoughts on the whole series to this point, but with the addition of my thoughts on Order of the Phoenix, I figure it is time I got caught up.I absolutely enjoyed this movie. I had heard all the clam-mering about Potter being a film and all the fans being pumped up, but as aforementioned, I had not read them, just know the basic outline. I thought Columbus captured a great sense of wonder and ""magic"" with the film. All of the leads were perfectly cast and Columbus set the stage for the series and no matter your opinion of him, have to give credit where credit is due on those two facts.My only complaint about the movie was the end, which kind of was a little anti-climatic, all in all though, everything with this film from the costumes, set designs and casting were spot on. But the biggest contributor, as is the case with many film he scores, William's score raises this film from being a really good film, to a great one. John Williams is an absolute genius when it comes to finding the right themes for characters. His music adds the perfect touch to all that is going on.This is the lowest rated film of the franchise out here on IMDb, but for someone seeing these oblivious to the books, this was a great start for the franchise and still remains my favorite of the franchise so far.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

A good start to an excellent franchise,"Yet face, if a book sales well, it is bound to made into a film, regardless of quality, or even if it is filmable. This is true for books like Twilight, the Golden Compass (or Northern Lights what it's really called) and Dan Brown's thrillers. J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series became one of the most popular series of books of all time, appealing to children and adults. There were written in a assessable style, with a clear and strong narrative, but with a good deal of backstory. A film adaption became enviable.Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is the first book, and film of the series, starting with Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) as an 11-year-old boy, raised as a regular human (muggle) child by his aunt and uncle. He is abused, forced to live in a small cupboard under the stairs whiles his cousin is spoiled rotten. But Harry's life is changed when he finds out that he had been admitted to Hogwarts, a school for wizards and witches. He discoveries that he is a celebrity in the wizardry world, but does not know his own family history. Whiles in Hogwarts Harry makes friends with Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and the three end up working together. Harry becomes the new star of the Quidditch team, and Hermione is the brains of the operation. The three believe that a threat to Hogwarts, with the Dark Wizard Lord Voldermort wanting the Philosopher's Stone hidden in Hogwarts and using his old follower Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) to get it.When this film was in pre-production a number of big-name directors were attached, including Terry Gilliam, M. Night Shyamalan, Alan Parker, Brad Silberling, Baz Luhrmann and even Steven Spielberg. Spielberg planned making the film animated with Haley Joel Osment doing the voice, luckily this never got off the ground. J.K. Rowling preferred was Terry Gilliam, an excellent director with great vision, but could be a handful with the film going overbudget. Warner Brothers settled for Chris Columbus, a director with a decent reputation for family films, like Home Alone and Mrs Doubtfire. He offers a steady hand, knowing what to do, having fun with CGI and light moments of comedy, as well trying to be like Spielberg involving sentimental moments. But he is not so good on the darker elements of the story, hedge why other directors were brought in for later films. Columbus is basically a safe pair of hands to start things off until the films could stand on their own legs.J.K. Rowling insisted that the cast for the film should have been all British and Irish. The studio played alone and it was a wise move, much like the Bond movies. It was have betrayed fans and non-fans to see an American Harry with either him in end up going to England or transferring the action to America. There is an excellent cast with actors like Richard Harris, Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, John Hurt, just to name a few. The type of film Harry Potter is it did not need a massive A-Lister like Brad Pitt or Will Smith, just good actors. The young actors who played the main three actors were however, not great. They were young, child actors with little experience, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint only acted in school plays. They do however improve in latter films, and we can forgive them because they were young and Chris Columbus isn't known for getting great performers from actors.The Philosopher's Stone is the most light-hearted of the films. They is good action and a fun story. Making the film a good start to the Harry Potter series, keeping it going to 2011.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Painful Schlock,"With the exception of a few impressive visual scenes, this film is unbearable. I generally like kids, but this film had me rooting for the bathroom ogre and the 3-headed monster dog to eat all children in sight, especially the three principal actors. They're awful - mostly due to painful overacting for which we can blame poor direction. If Hermione doesn't get on your last nerve, nothing will. Yeah, so the film has some heartwarming positive messages, but the characters are so non-endearing and the storyline is so mechanical that in the end, you just don't care.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Great and funny,"After watching the this, I knew that I must watch the sequels and read the books. This film starts off with some funny bits were the Dursleys are yelling at Harry when really it is Dudley being the misbehaved one. Let's remember that this film is set in the 1990s,not the 21st century and yet Dudley still manages to get all sorts of interesting presents. The arrival of Hagrid instantly made you like him. He's my favourite Harry Potter character because he's clumsy and dangerous, a bit like me.Hermione was attractive and Draco Malfoy as the bully seemed like a good plot to use throughout both this film and the others. (People do wear socks in bed just to say so please don't make that sound non existent.) The book was just as good as the film and to be fair, there are some things that don't work as well when it's in the book.The troll scene was a bit gross so I'm glad it ended very quickly, if you ask me, Hermione should not have lied about what happened, she was the victim when she knew nothing.The mystery of who the main villain was very interesting because it made me wonder whether it was Hagrid or Snape. The fact that it was Professor Quirrel was a plot twist to remember.

Destined to become a children's classic the likes of Wizard of Oz.,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is based off the immensely popular book of the same name, about an 11 year old boy who finds out he's actually a wizard, and is sent to a wizard school where evil waits for him at every turn.Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is extremely enjoyable to watch. Just to see all the special effects put to use with the magic sequences is amazing. This is one of those movies that I'll still be watching and enjoying as an adult, like Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, or The Wizard of Oz.The performances in the movie are really good. The director picked all the right people for the roles. Even the three main kids were really good in their parts.Like any book to film, I was disappointed with how much stuff got left out from the book that I was looking forward to seeing on film, but otherwise, it was a pretty faithful adaptation.A really good movie. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Essentially unwatchable,"I will never understand how this movie gets the ratings that it does. I saw it as a child when it first came out and hated it. To be fair, its impossible for the movies to weave the same kind of magic as the books. I thought I would be able to appreciate it separate from the books as an adult but oh man was I wrong, still unwatchable. The script is thin and the acting is awful. The only saving graces are Richard Harris as Dumbledore and a marvelous score. Otherwise, this film is decidedly unmagical.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Almost perfect,"I had extremely high expectations for this movie, and it met almost all of them. The only thing that slightly marred this otherwise excellent adaption was the absence of the potion challenge in the final sequence, and it dropped my rating from 10 to 9, since I felt it was one of Hermione's defining moments. However, the rest of the movie was spectacular - superb acting (Rickman, Smith, Coltrane - too many to mention, really), good pacing in the direction. But the main thing that struck me, an avid reader of Rowling, is that everything looked RIGHT - never once did I see something in the movie that conflicted with how I imagined the book. For this, Columbus and crew should be greatly commended. I cannot wait until the Chamber of Secrets.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Very well done, very entertaining and fun to watch","Though I have not read the Harry Potter books, I saw this film and found it to be truly entertaining and fun movie to see.Whether you are a child, a child at heart, or an adult that enjoys a good break from reality, it is very likely that you will enjoy watching this film.The child actors are excellent (why couldn't George Lucas find one good child actor for Phantom Menace?), as are the adult actors in this film. The plot is wonderful.My advice:  sit back, watch the film on a big screen, and enjoy yourself!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Great Book.  Good Movie, But Should Have Been Better.","If you asked me which was my favorite Harry Potter book, I'd have a tough time telling you.  I've read all four to date, and thoroughly enjoyed each one.  What makes the books thoroughly captivating is their combination of the big and the small; quiet self-discovery and rollicking adventure; magic and the ordinary world.  So, what went wrong with this movie?It's this:  ALL the ""small"" scenes are missing.  Hermione helping Harry and Ron with their homework.  Harry comforting the poor kid, self-conscious, hand-me-down Ron, with stories about his own extremely impoverished upbringing.  Ron's brothers teasing each other and Ron.  Madam Pince, the librarian, shaking her feather duster in exasperation at Harry.  And hundreds more.  All those ""little"" interchanges that unveil the characters and their world to us in the book and show us their development and growth, and let us bond with them, are just not in the movie.  Okay, arguably, with Alan Rickman as Snape you don't really have to work too hard to show the audience Snape's dark and nasty side.  But, that economy of casting shortchanges the audience.  For example, Snape does some really mean and nasty things to Harry in the book that really challenges Harry's nature and spirit.  But by NOT showing us ANY of that, Chris Columbus leaves us only with pre-made fully-developed characters, and not the living, growing children of Rowling's masterpieces.So, what IS left?  Sort of a junior ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" set in a magical world.  Nothing to sneeze at, certainly, and a very enjoyable movie, but a complete turnabout of Rowling's focus and emphasis.  Where Rowling depicts ordinary children (or at least magical children with many recognizably ordinary traits) and their ""mundane"" although hilarious lives at this magical wizards school, and secondarily describes their high adventures, Columbus turns the formula around.  In his movie, the adventures are first and foremost, and the rest gets skated over.  Rowling, too, has a true gift for comic exaggeration and counterpoint, which here gets short shrift.Compare this movie to ""The Witches"", that masterpiece of Nicolas Roeg's from Roald Dahl's classic book, with Angelica Huston as the chief nasty.  Or with Rob Reiner's fractured fairy tale, ""The Princess Bride"".  ""Harry Potter"" should have been a lot more fun, and could have been, if somehow a better balance had been struck.  Still, that said, see the movie.  Just hope for something better from the next one, and the next one, and the one after that!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Just like the book, but not in a good way","Word for word, it followed the book.  Some people may see this as a good thing, but the best film adaptations of books are the ones that take the FEELINGS and THEMES from the book and transform them from the written format to the screen.  This movie, however, was like listening to a cassette of the book with silly little special effects and poor animations carrying out the actions.For a kids movie, this was entirely too long.  I had a time sitting through the dull 2 1/2 hours, and I'm an adult.  There was no plot, no action, just a whole bunch of character development.  Maybe the next 2 movies will be better now that we've got all the characters, the school, the history, the animals and the spell components established.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

A faithful adaptation,"I will always think fondly of this movie because it inspired me to pick up the first Harry Potter book and I've been a rabid fan ever since. I'm one of those book before movie people so I had to read the novel in order to go see this movie and I was pleased to see that it was such a faithful adaptation to Rowling's wonderful tale.This movie did a wonderful job of capturing the wonder and awe of the first HP novel. Hogwarts was an especially lovely effect and when Harry first walks into the Great Hall and all the candles are floating overhead, I felt all the magic I felt when reading those words on the page. I think Columbus and crew captured the essence of the castle and somehow managed to create a visual of something so fantastical.The casting of the movie was also extremely well done. I adore Maggie Smith as McGonagall and Richard Harris captures the mischievous and wise nature of Dumbledore. Perhaps best of all the adult casting is that of Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid. He looks exactly as I pictured the character but, more importantly, he captures Hagrid's rather childlike nature and the accent is wonderful. Coltrane doesn't just portray Hagrid, he is Hagrid.I also thought the children were wonderfully cast. Daniel Radcliffe looks like Harry and I fought back tears when his earnest young face first looked into the Mirror of Erised. Rupert Grint looks just as I pictured Ron Weasley and Emma Watson is wonderfully bossy and a fantastic know-it-all as Hermione Granger. The casting of the Phelps brothers as the Weasley twins was absolutely brilliant and I think they were dead on in their interpretation of the lovable scoundrels.Yet in spite of its fantastical nature, this film, like the book, feels as though it is something like our own reality. There are many wonderful things in Harry's world but it's not that different from our own. The same prejudices and the same human frailties that exist in our world exist in Harry's. Though being a wizard is pretty darn cool, it's not the answer to Harry's problems and the film makes clear that he has some difficult challenges ahead of him.I think the central theme of this movie is one that is invaluable for both children and adults alike: that love is the most powerful magic that exists. Even with all the wand waving and fantastical creatures, it is love that is Harry's salvation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A magical introduction to the Wizarding World,"""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"" directed by Chris Columbus, is the first film in the iconic Harry Potter series, adapted from J. K. Rowling's beloved novel. The movie introduces us to the magical world through the eyes of Harry Potter, an orphan who discovers on his eleventh birthday that he is a wizard.As Harry embarks on his journey to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the film beautifully captures the wonder and excitement of a young boy stepping into a world of magic for the first time. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson deliver charming performances as Harry, Ron, and Hermione, bringing the beloved trio to life.The film excels in world-building, with its detailed set designs, impressive special effects, and faithful adaptation of the source material. Key scenes, such as the visit to Diagon Alley, the Sorting Hat ceremony, and the thrilling game of Quidditch, are visually captivating and stay true to the book's spirit.John Williams' enchanting score enhances the magical atmosphere, while the supporting cast, including Richard Harris as Dumbledore and Maggie Smith as McGonagall, add depth and gravitas to the story.While some may find the pacing a bit slow, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" successfully introduces the characters and sets the stage for the adventures to come. It's a nostalgic and magical beginning to a beloved series that continues to captivate audiences of all ages.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Spellless Magic,"""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" may be a classic beloved by many, but for me, it just doesn't click. Although I watched some of the films in the franchise, I never found anything really interesting. The characters don't captivate me, they lack charisma and depth. The plot seems shallow, as if it were a silly story a child might create for a school project. Magic and the wizarding world, which should be fascinating, end up seeming devoid of charm. That doesn't mean it's the worst thing in the world, but it certainly didn't keep me hooked. I haven't read the books to compare, but based on the films, the experience is boring and bland. Perhaps fantasy fans will find something more, but for me, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" was a disappointment.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Visuals: 10; Story 6,"For me, the book was all about Harry overcoming his self doubt, which is a struggle that we all can identify with. The movie was faithful to the narrative, but it left out Harry's struggle with self doubt. That's like doing Gone with the Wind without the Civil War. I can see why kids loved it, but with a little effort, it could have been so much better. Still, I loved seeing Diagon Alley and Hogwarts brought to life, and the actors were all terrific.

A beautiful and clever way to start,"Although my 7, I can't really tell if there was a better way to start Harry Potter.It really does summon all the essencial details in childish way, and thats the most important aspect in my opinion.Talking about a series, that would take long to develop, the feeling we all have watching those movies, especially if you grow up with them (like me), is that they are each time less childish. You feel that, not only in the general plot but int the photography, in the music, in the dialogues.Harry Potter's serie builds up just right, and this is important in this review 'cause it all started here. A childish movie, for the kids and pre-teens, to love and fantasy. But also not that childish so the adults, parents or anyone, to actually dislike.The movie itself has a nice plot, a nice way to direct it, cool shots and a good script. My rating is 7, and a good 7, because looking this movie in a cold way, without thinking about the Harry Potter's series, it might be a bit boring at some points if your are not a kid, but again, you wont dislike (and the rest of the films wont let you down)But one thing must be said, the role this film plays in history, is unmeasurable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

"An illustration to the book, read the book first.","Unfortunately, the film cannot stand alone, without support of the book, and the viewers that did not read the book would find it long, boring, not accentuated. The suspense scenes are not suspenseful enough and the funny scenes are not funny enough. One of the subplots of the book is teaching Neville Longbottom to stand up for himself. The movie skips the moments of Malfoy's bullying Neville and thus the 10 points for Gryffindor in the end don't seem logical. It seems this is the result of poor editing. Some scenes were cut to make the movie shorter without taking into account the following scenes. Definitely, the movie is very politically correct avoiding calling Hermione a witch. That's funny but, unfortunately, this kills one of the funniest episodes in the book.The special effects were good. The quidich game was simply great. Hogwarts was great too, especialy the Great Hall. But Hagrid's cabin had to be wooden.The characters were not bad, especially bossy Hermione and Ron. Snape and Quirell were, weak, underdevelopped, however. I gave it 7/10. Perhaps a little bit too high.

I think that most people are trying too hard to pick it apart instead of sitting back and enjoying it.  I can't imagine how they could have made it more perfect.

"Exciting, yet predictable.","Harry Potter was a fun movie, especially if you have children who are enchated by these stories.  But taking it on it's own as just a movie, without any pre-read book bias, it is a mediocre movie.Now, I must preface this by saying, I have not read the books, so I have not had the chance to come under J.K. Rowling's spell.  But when you watch the movie, it feels like you are reading a book and each scene is only a chapter without a flow to the story line.  Each little adventure does not seem to really advance the story. It was a fun movie though with your usual special effects although there was nothing ground breaking.  The Quidditch/Broomstick scenes made use of CG humans which I thought was particularly unconvincing Overall fun, but make sure you bring a kid/adult who enjoys Mr. Potter so you can revel in the public hysteria that is Hogwart's.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

An average start,"I've read all the Harry Potter books and of course I had high expectations with the movie. I'm not disappointed.To be candid, the movie is no competition for the magical book but it follows the book closely enough. I'm just surprised that even though everything is adapted accurately, the film manages to be colossally dull while the novel was highly interesting. Upon musing about this, I realized that it's primely the cause of the outdated visual effects. Other than that, the magical world is depicted as if the setting is that of the late nineteenth or early twentieth century. A little modern look could've helped a lot.The acting - like the movie - is strictly average. The kids seem a little too childish and the background score sometimes feel over the top; I loved Hedwig's theme though. The direction is to be blamed for the lack or rather incompetence of the correct emphasis on certain scenes. Some irrelevant scenes feel the same as the climax, there is nothing to differentiate. Harry's Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia and his bully cousin are presented more as cartoon characters which makes the watcher refrain from taking the movie seriously. Therefore, it's supposedly viewed as a children's movie with little or no entertainment and a dull setting.The only thing worth watching is the unfolding of the manner in which the magical world works, since this is the first installment.I hope the sequels are going to improve and provide justice to J.K. Rowling's phenomenal series.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
...Bewitching....,"A tad long, but otherwise an enjoyable time.

The late Richard Harris may be difficult to replace as the headmaster...perhaps a promotion for the hulking Robbie Coltrane? I saw the film on HBO so I perhaps missed out on the special effects, which were effective even on a television screen.

Harry Potter was well written and entertaining but could have used more from the book,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the first of J.K. Rowling's magical series. This young protagonist starts out by living the muggle life with his aunt, uncle, and annoyance of a cousin Dudley, knowing very little of his mysterious and mystical past. It was his twelfth birthday when he started to receive letters from Hogwarts, inviting him to spend the next term as a new student of the wizard and witches academy. Hagrid, a wizard friend, comes and retrieves Harry from his horrific living arrangements to take him away. By this point in the 2001 film, director Chris Columbus does a fantastic job of drawing the viewer into the movie, though compared to the book doesn't do quite as fair in introducing Harry's background. Overall, Columbus does a great job in taking Rowling's work and turning it into an animated film, but there are minor differences in the plot that are left out that many might feel should not have been. Included are background, dialogue, and some scenes from the story that did a fantastic job in building a great story. Daniel Radcliff, the actor portraying Potter, makes a wonderful role for the part. He really gives a sense of character and admiration to the heroic role he plays. From his accent to his appearance, he characterizes is the perfect picture from the imagination. Robbie Coltrane, on the other hand, seems to be cheated out of a good part. The 6'1'' actor does a magnificent job portraying the enormous bearded Hagrid. He plays the dim giant very well, and certainly makes one see the Hagrid they imagine, thick accent included; but when it comes to dialog, Hagrid's character in the film is just lack-luster. The novel is perfect in personifying him, while the film leaves out lines and cuts out scenes that help make Hagrid as good as Coltrane could have potentially made him. Overall the acting and casting of the movie was excellently done and there are very few changes that could have been made to make it any better. The special effects in this film were superb. When looking at the time this movie was made, and seeing how realistic the flying and quidditch matches, the magical spells, and even the mystical creatures, it is hard to believe how great they turned out. The lighting in the film was a little dark and bothersome, but when looking at the setting and mysterious feel the film was going for, it is completely acceptable and understandable. The film work was well done. Though it could have used some work, Columbus did a great job in finding the best way to film these witches and wizards. Overall I rate the film a 7 out of 10 for a fun and exciting story, for kids and adults alike. Great acting, dialogue, and filming, and special effects that keeps the action feeling real. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is certainly a film worth watching to any avid science fiction fantasy fan or just a general audience looking for some strange and mischievous fun.

Imaginative Enactment of Classic with Impressive Special Effects & Fine Storytelling.,"The long anticipated Harry Potter has something for everyone.  Fans of the book, which I did not read, are treated to what I understand is a faithful reproduction of the text.  Although people like me will not know about muggles, hogwarts, goblins, wizards, elves and Sorcerer's Stones, that disadvantage can be overcome.  The wide range of villains and obstacles for our heroes to conquer will satisfy adventure fans.  The unusual number of surprises and defiances of convention should delight magic aficionados. Admirers of good performing will appreciate the ensemble acting of Harry Potter (Dan Radcliffe) and classmates Ronald (Rupert Grint) and especially Hermione (Emma Watson II).  Veteran actors Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, John Hurt and John Cleese ably support them.  Feminists will appreciate how Hermione takes charge in critical moments in an effort to rescue her male companions.  She does it with brains and wizardry rather than force and violence.  I admire her spunk.There are two spectacular sequences, one involving an air game resembling hockey and the other a chess match with violence at every move.  Other special effects -- involving wizardry, secret passages and unusual adversaries like giant creatures and three-headed dogs -- keep the audience at the edge of its seat.  The castle that houses the school campus is itself a sight to behold with forbidden chambers, fascinating architecture and lively student body and faculty.   Of course, there is the classic battle between good and evil, but many characters have elements of both.  Action scenes are plentiful, but not to the extent that character development and plot are neglected.  The fast pace ensures that no one will be bored, although the multitude of characters with weird names and obscure powers (e.g. potion making, levitation) is sometimes hard to follow.  In short, Harry Potter is not groundbreaking, but a fun movie that knows how to pace itself and end on cue.  It tells a good story and allows our imaginations, often constrained since childhood, to flourish again.It's suitable for children and adults.  Despite some violence, there's no profanity, nudity or anything offensive for younger eyes.  However, it may be too intense for children under six.  Adults can also enjoy this as escapist entertainment not unlike an Indiana Jones movie.  At my showing at 6:30 in the evening, all viewers were grown-ups.  I look forward to the sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Better than I expected....,"....But only just, and as I had really low expectations... Make your own mind up.No, I am being too harsh.

But, as I said, I liked it.  and Will probably watch it again and will also probably watch the chamber of secrets....

Classic!,"The very beginning of a classic film franchise that many people (including me) call a big part of their childhood. When I was a kid, I loved this movie and watched it over and over again. I probably know all the lines in the movie. Then, when I was 14, I watched it again and this time, after reading the book (which is awesome, by the way) and while I enjoyed it as always because all the beautiful memories I get, I found some flaws. Most of them are about differences from the book but we can all say this part is one of the most faithful ones to the book. I will not say much about child actors considering that they were still unexperienced.Looking at them, I must say Emma Watson did the best job as Hermione Granger and Tom Felton was also really good as Draco Malfoy and he just makes you want to punch him in the face which is a good thing looking at his character. Now about adult actors. I think Maggie Smith did the best job as Harry's strict but awesome professor McGonagall. And I'll have to mention Alan Rickman that was really intimidating as professor Snape. I will not mention cast anymore because in my opinion everyone did good. Effects were fine for early 2000s but it doesn't look so good today. But there are some scenes that are still as thrilling as in 2001. But the most brilliant thing in this film is John Williams' beautiful score which totally brings me back to childhood and makes everything more magical. So, when you put everything together, it's a really entertaining fantasy every family should watch and the start of a great adventure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Not just a live action version of the book,I remember when it was first released that there would be a movie and the millions of fans started asking questions like: who will play Harry and who will play Hagrid. Then people started thinking that there was no way the movie could be as good as the book and were sure Chris Columbus would screw it up. When the film finally came out people went expecting to see a bad movie made simply to make money from all the fans. But it was so much more than that the movie would be popular even without the popularity of the book it is good in it's own right and Daniel Radcliff was perfect for the part of Harry.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

A very well put together attempt to encompass the JK Rowlings Book.,"Overall, the film is very impressive, working well as a tribute to the book, without compromising on it's entertainment value as a film.However, my one gripe with the film, was the actors playing the leads. I realise it must be hard to find child actors who fit specific physical descriptions, such as the detailed one about Harry Potter laid down in the books, but the ones that they found were certainly less than impressive. Wooden at best and hamstrung at their worst.Other than that, very enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Subjective view of mine on amazing film,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone was released in 2001, and Daniel Radcliffe was starred in all the film in the Harry Potter series. Chris Columbus directed this fantasy movie based on the novel 'Harry Potter' by J. K. Rowling. Harry Potter shows the purity of children and gives us a chance to look back on our lives. We can see the kind of magic we could imagine when we were children such as making something floating in the sky, getting in a car which can fly in the sky, and magic that can make someone or something invisible.The film is set in Hogwarts, where Harry Potter is a young wizard. When Harry Potter was a child, his family abused him by forcing him to do many chores. One day, he gets an admission card from Hogwarts. The card is the beginning of the new life for him and his new best friends, Hermione Granger and ""Ron"" Weasley, with magic, professors, and new world. Harry Potter enters a new dormitory called Gryffindor. While getting to know about school life and experiencing the life, he realizes there's something going on in Hogwarts related to a stone hidden in the school. He starts to dig out the truth about the secret. Finally, he faces a dangerous situation.The set of Harry Potter is a magnificent castle which is big enough to accommodate all the student. Students can take a class and even fly with their broomsticks in the castle. Furthermore, this wonderful castle is combined with special effects including monsters, magic, and many wizards. When Harry Potter flies with his broomstick, the castle looks marvelous and made me think I'm definitely going there before I die. Of course, inside the castle, the classroom seems really antique and huge. In addition to this, the hall where students usually gather and have breakfast, lunch, and dinner with beautiful sky made by magic is the perfect place for making students want to study.With the wonderful set and magic, Harry Potter gives us whole new fantasy. While watching this movie, we could escape from our daily lives. This could give us a relaxing time and the energy which may help us face our problems with a fresh perspective.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Well-made adaption of the book,"Young soon-to-be wizard Harry Potter lives a dreadful life with his mean step-parents, untill one day when a letter arrives. It says that Harry is a wizard and he should come to a school called Hogwarts to learn more. Eventually, Harry is on his way to the school, where lots of adventures await him.""Harry Potter"" has huge expectations on its shoulders, and I´m happy to say it lives up to them. But it should be added that I´m not a huge fan of the book, I read it and thought it was good, but I couldn´t really understand all the attention it has been given. But I have to say that Chris Columbus has created an excellent adaption, that includes the very best parts of the story and also remains faithful to J.K Rowling´s book. It has the same nice details as the book and it actually takes its time to develop the characters. The effects are mostly top-notch and the set-pieces are awesome. The climax is definitely the Quidditch match, this was made to be seen on the big screen!If you think of how many child actors we have here, the acting is sensational! Daniel Radcliffe is perfect and just as I imagined Harry. However, he is easily outshined by ginger-haired Rupert Grint, who plays young comedian Ron Weasly, who provides the most laughs. But the real discovery of the kids is Emma Watson as bossy Hermione. You could tell after one minute of Ms Watson that she will be huge in the future! The older actors are perfectly cast as well. Richard Harris, Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith are solid, while Robbie Coltrane and John Hurt provide warmth.The movie´s few problems is its length, I definitely don´t agree with those who thought it was to short. It loses tempo towards the end, and the finale is a disappointment. Another problem is that the book is not without its flaws from the very beginning. You could forgive it since it takes more than half of the movie to introduce the characters and the environments. Because after that comes a cheap story about a ""Philosopher´s Stone"" that feels relatively uninteresting. But you have to remember that this is the first episode of a long series. Looking forward to ""The Chamber of Secrets"" already.4/5",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

"The Good news is that it is enjoyable, well made with good acting; the bad news is that it's 2 and a half hours long and at times it did feel that it was this long","Harry Potter is an orphaned child whom is living an ordinary existence with his aunt and uncle (though they treat him like dirt whilst they allow their spoilt son free reign). However, when several mysterious letter continue to arrive in Harry's name, this eventually leads to a meeting with Hagrid whom informs Harry that he has been selected for a school for magicians known as Hogwarts... Although Harry is initially excited at the prospect of attending such a school he soon learns that there are many dangers and several characters whom he feels he is unable to trust...This is the first film in the franchise so I suppose it is inevitable that time needs to be spent on giving Harry a backstory, getting him to Hogwarts and then explaining what forms the crux of the plot (which comes to the fore in the second half of the film).For me though, things do unfold quite slowly in this film meaning that it may be a tad frustrating to some viewers. The good news on the whole though is that this first Harry Potter film has enough about it to remain interesting (this is mostly down to the wonderful performances by the 'at the time' child actors who gel together magnificently). Many of the adults also fare well with the likes of Harris, Smith, Rickman and Coltrane in particular being superb.The middle portion of the film where the kids are finding their feet and learning about the Philosopher's stone is quite engaging, but it is undeniably a slow part of the film (close to an hour is taken up with this section which I'm not entirely sure was necessary).Still it has enough magic, intrigue and escapism about it to make it enjoyable and worth watching, but at 2 and a half hours it is a bit of a slog to get through. I'm aware that all of the films in this franchise are long, but I'm hoping that, as an opener, this is just long in setting things up and the subsequent sequels get to the point a lot quicker.The jury's out on that one at the moment.

Pretty close to the book.,I remember growing up and I loved the Harry Potter books I have read them all. This was a pretty good movie it was pretty close to the book but even with a two and half hour runtime it still leaves out many things and thats why the book is much better. The acting in these older ones is pretty bad too seeing how they were just child no name actors back then.This movie is about a young boy named harry potter. He lives with his abusive aunt and uncle and one day gets a letter from a place called Hogwarts. The note explains he is actually a wizard and he is invited to go to Hogwarts school for witchcraft and wizards.This movie was pretty good but it was probably one of the worst of the bunch.

series has a shaky start,"An 11-year-old orphan finds out he is a wizard, and subsequently attends wizarding school, where he learns intriguing facts about his past.Too many scenes fall flat. From the moment Dumbledore casually walks on-screen, the magical elements are treated in a matter-of-fact manner; director Chris Columbus fails to imbue them with a sense of wonder. There are fake-looking special effects (the backgrounds during the flying scenes), as well as some good ones (the moving staircases). But the worst offender is the generic, intrusively over-active score.Despite all the flaws, the story carries you along. Columbus tends to encourage overacting, but several of the actors here (especially Maggie Smith) apparently didn't oblige. Alan Rickman is probably the best-cast actor in the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Solid Adaption to Kick Off a Phenomena,"This was my first time rewatching this movie. I made a joke to Jaime, my wife, about how the Harry Potter series of movies are Christmas movies. This idea happened when bringing up Die Hard. Last year, when we brought our daughter home from the NICU, we watched the latter ones. We both had seen them and just wanted something on in the background.What is interesting here is that knowing how things play out from reading the novels and then coming back a second time to the movies, there are things that I picked out. This does well in setting up Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and helping not only us, but him learn the ways of the wizarding world. He was left in the care of his Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw), Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths) and his cousin Dudley Dursley (Harry Melling) after his parents were killed. They raise him.Now that he's 11, he's ready to join that world that they hate. There is more to the world than he realizes when he goes off to Hogwarts and meets his new best friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). He also meets his new rival, Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton).He is quite behind on what he should know and has issues with Professor Snape (Alan Rickman). It is fun to go back to the beginning now that I know much more information. Jaime is also more of an expert here, which helps as well.This one isn't working with the budget that they'll have later. The CGI can be wonky. It is also fun to experience a world like this and we are there with Harry who had no idea about it either. This movie does a great job at bringing that all to life. I should also say that we have a great cast here featuring Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Warwick Davis, Verne Troyer, John Hurt, John Cleese and David Bradley, to just name more.Not a great movie but does a good job to start this series off. Another thing that I like is that as the characters get older, what they deal with gets tougher. It stays on a level where they can manage it, which is another perk that it has going for it.My Rating: 7.5 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Enjoyable, but hardly brilliant.","I came to the film without having read the books. I had heard the movie followed slavishly to the novel but I reckoned if the movie was good enough, that shouldn't matter. So did the film feel like the adaption of a novel? Yes, very much so. It's obvious director Chris Columbus was scared of doing anything too radical with the material and so the movie tends to get bogged down at times. Certain elements in books do not translate well to movies unless done with a bit of flair - Columbus doesn't do this and so there is a certain weakness to the movie's structure. The acting isn't outstanding either among the kids. Daniel Radcliffe left as much of an impression on me as a battering with a soft feather would. It's not like he's from the dreadful Jake ""Phantom Menace"" Lloyd school of acting but he's entirely unremarkable all the same. Very forgettable performance. Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermione) are similarly perfunctionary and nothing more. The best performance is probably shared by Alan Rickman (Severus Snape) and Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) who really come across exactly what I would imagine from a kids book. The directing is perfectly competent and some of the action scenes are handled well - the quidditch match stands out most of all. Obviously Columbus was constrained by the material at hand and the target audience - I was hardly expecting to see Darren Aronofsky split-screen images of Hermione and Harry talking... The whole thing ends up like a well-done but by-the-numbers piece. No innovation here, no gambles. It was made to be as inoffensive as possible while trying to please as many. It's too long and could do with some pruning but in the end you're still left with an enjoyable movie. Just not a particularly brilliant one. 6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Great movie, but wheres Peeve's?","I have to say this movie utterly left me flabbergasted. Not having read J. K. Rowlings immensly popular novels, and ignoring the jeers of my friends I went to see this movie with small expectations and returned a huge fan of Harry Potter. Where to begin with what the movie does right. First off is the casting of only British actors especially in the leading roles. To me thinking of some American actor stumbling around as Potter or Granger faking a British accent would have been just terrible. Thankfully Chris Columbus who seems to be the last person I would be praising after Nine Months, decided to steer off from that Hollywood movie machine idea. And speaking of the actors, they all do a wonderful job fleshing out the characters especially the young leads. Daniel Radcliffe finds just the right note making Harry Potter a character every audience member can envy and cheer at the same time time. Emma Watson plays the feisty Hermione Granger almost exactly as she is written in the book with that little bit of tartness I think most young girls have at that age( at least my sister does anyway.) Tom Felton hits just the right note of pure arrogance and prissyness as Draco Malfoy that you just want some to stand up and slap him during the movie. And Rupert Grint has fun delivering some of the funniest lines in the movie while also becoming equally as heroic as his two counterparts when the time calls for it. As for their older counterparts, they all play to greater range than would usually be called for in a movie of this type. Richard Harris is a standout as headmaster Albus Dumbeldore and Maggie Smith shines as Minerva McGonagle. Their not acting because their grandchildren are fans of the books, their in the movie because they believe in what they are performing. Another thing to note is Hogwarts itself. Everything is set to the screen amazingly intricate detail from the great hall to some of the classrooms themselves. Of special note, one of my favorite parts from the book is also one of the best set designs in recent memory, the huge wizard's chess board under Hogwarts. I also liked the fact that they didn't point out most of the special effects (i.e. ghosts, and moving pictures.) Some of these add too the visual flair of Hogwart's while enhancing the overall setting. When they do focus on special effects some are grand and exciting like the quidditch match (WOW) while others just fail to impress like Fluffy the three headed dog. Another thing, and this is very minor mind you is the exclusion of Peeves the poltergeist. As I found him to be one of the funner characters I wish they could have added him somewhere in the movie. Perhaps in one of the scenes involving Harry and his friends sneaking around the school at night while being followed by Mr. Filch the schools caretaker, he could have popped up. Maybe? Anyway thats just a small complaint to an otherwise terrific film. Sure its long, but trust me its well worth the price of the ticket.

Terrible Terrible film,"How on earth did this get up to the lofty heights of an 8.1 rating?I have never read the books, but went to see the film on the back of a good rating here, and many critics saying how good it was.  This film was awful. I'd give it a 5/10 for reasonable sets, costumes, effects and making me laugh (twice). I actually voted it as a 1/10 though to hopefully give some more realism to it's rating.The quidditch game is pathetic. I thought we british invented good games, you know tennis, golf, football, etc. If it's a good game, we invented it. JK Rowling supposedly is british, but judging by this poorly thought through piece of crap she's gotta be american (or worse).The ginger lad gets praised for ""the best game of chess ever played at hogwarts"" or something, and yet we get to see none of the game other than him making the worst possible first move available to him. An untrained chimpanzee could have guessed a better move. Out of the 20 or so things he could have done how does this master-chess-boy make the worst possible move???The plot is terrible and full of holes, the biggest seeming to be: Why the hell didn't the badguy use his knowledge to get past the dog earlier? He'd known for half the film, but still only just gets there before Harry who only learns at the end how to bypass the dog!I thought no matter what that the film is at least choc full of top quality actors and no matter what it will therefore be at least ""ok"". How wrong I was... None of the good actors get anything more than tiny bit parts, and mainly even then they act way below standard - but what can be done with this script?All in all, don't see this unless you are a fan of the book, or have some money & time that you absolutely must waste.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Filled with delight and excitement with constant wonders to be opened and is easily transformed from words to motion,"When I first went into the cinema to see a film, I was originally going to see K-PAX since I was a huge Kevin Spacey fan. Turns out that the film is going to run late because it's opening weekend for the newest Harry Potter film. Being a semi-Harry Potter fan at the time, I didn't mind, I wanted to see a film at the moment, so I thought, ""Why not?"" My other choice was probably the Disney/Pixar film Monsters Inc, but I was happy that I invested my eight bucks on this film, because it is worth it - or at least more than Monsters Inc - but that's a different story.I have read the original material by JK Rowling back in the late 1990s so I do know what's going on. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone starts in sort of a weary tone, with a death of a infant's parents, sent to his aunt and uncle. A few minutes later, I was shocked how enjoyable the film is. I had a form a delight rushing through my sleeves. That was when I decided that I would rather watch this than the seriously-toned K-PAX.As the film arrives at its main location, Hogwarts, director Chris Columbus (whoa - from Home Alone to fabulous set designs) puts magic into the school as much as Rowling's novel has done. The school is beautiful and is exactly how fans may imagined it. The school is glamorous and it's just wonderful. It has breathtaking scenes.There is a very attractive all-star UK cast, such as Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, etc. I was surprised how they got all those actors to participate in this film. But not to mention, the child actors were all right as well, almost the way we have imagined them - in looks, I mean. Daniel Radcliffe makes a semi-believable Harry, or it looks like he's doing an impression of Harry, but that's all right because his acting is sort of a minimal part of the film. If Radcliffe's acting was getting on my nerves, I can easily stare into the background of castles and wonderful costumes. Rupert Grint is a pretty natural actor, as plucky Ron Weasley. You kind of like him, because he is normal and you can relate to such a person. Most of all, I loved the portrayal of Hermione Granger, played by Emma Watson. As Richard Roeper puts it, she reminds you of Holly Hunter in James L. Brooks memorable classic, Broadcast News. Without Watson in the cast, the three leads would be plain and boring, and whoever who was chosen for the part would be just be stepping into the place of destiny. I thought Alan Rickman was a wise choice for one of my favorite characters, or classic villains - Severus Snape. He brings life into the serious-toned teacher and he makes him sort of a borderline human being. You have to like him because of his strict portrayal of Snape make you chuckle. Richard Harris gives a sentimental performance as Dumbledore, which is as much enjoyable as Rickman's portrayal as Snape. Same goes to the portrayal of Hagrid, which I enjoyed as much as I did to the rest of the cast. The cast is well-chosen - or at least bearable for fans of these well-loved characters.The story is simply put on screen. Steve Kloves, the American screenwriter who wrote/directed the nostalgic Michelle Pfeiffer and Bridges brothers flick, The Fabulous Baker Boys, really pulls this one through. You can almost feel that he knows the book and most of all, he stays true to the book through his script. I think Chris Columbus matured in his story. Maybe he's not a Cameron Crowe-actor-director, you can see he really knows the book and read everything carefully because his decisions for the sets are perfect because the sets flow nicely with the book. Even though the so-called special effects were a bit corny (like the three-headed dog, Fluffy), you kind of forget about those stuff and go with the flow because Columbus is a master of these somewhat-classic films because he really knows his family films. He is great at working with child actors - in the past he has worked with Macaulay Culkin (Home Alone), Jena Malone (Stepmom), etc. Columbus is one of those directors who makes entertaining films that almost everyone can bear, and that is what makes him so great. His films may not have the signature of ""Colubmus"" on it, but you like them and you smile all the way through.This is an enjoyable film for all ages (I hope it's not too scary for younger kids) and I don't think you have to like the book to like the movie. It's a very entertaining film (credit: Chris Columbus) and the sets and costumes are wonderful, the dialogue and characters stays true to the book, and there are not extra snippets or ridiculous put-ons that may ruin the books. This is my opinion of course because many prefer Alfonso Cuaron's take on Harry Potter films in the third film (Prisoner of Azkaban) but people must understand that Columbus and Cuaron are different directors and they have different takes on what they think a film should be. I think Columbus's vision of Harry Potter is much more similar to the original book's vision, so I must give full credit for that. All in all, this is a fairly enjoyable film with a fairly enjoyable plot line mixed with fine acting from the veterans of British cinema. I have seen this film 6 times and I wouldn't mind watching it again in the near-future.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

I am not really sure why. It was practically the whole book word for word, so I don't think there was any information lost.  So far I've attributed it to the fact that they just aren't the type to enjoy that genre of movies ... but I'm not sure.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
It is an excellent movie with great graphics,This movie was well put together.

Bloody Brilliant ? Bloody Crap More Like,"I don`t rate JK Rowling as a writer so when the hype machine stated that HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER`S STONE ( As it`s called in Britain ) was going to be faithful to the book I thought this was a film that wasn`t worth seeing but I decided to give it a chance , after all I hadn`t expected much from THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING but I ended up falling in love with Peter Jackson`s beautiful masterpiece . But after watching THE PHILOSOPHER`S STONE my instincts had been proved right and in many ways the film had lived down to expectations .First of all I found it highly patronizing the way it talks down to its audience in a very substandard Roald Dahl way . Secondly the film has far too many characters that add nothing to the plot , and thirdly I`m not sure if the film actually has a plot . Yeah things happen but many of these things don`t seem to lead to anything so why were they included ?I noticed the second Harry Potter film didn`t perform as well as hoped which gives me hope that the next films in the franchise bomb big time . And I reckon Frodo Baggins could kick Harry Potter`s ass",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Talented, Magical, and Inspired Escapist Entertainment","Thank God for Harry Potter. Yes this is a phenomenon, yes this needed the book to be where it is, and YES it's been hyped, and good for it! Is that a sin? Not when I checked. I'll be honest, I've never laid a finger on the books, so regarding the accuracy and faithfulness of the book I can't comment on. But A) I understood it, so it obviously stood on it's own. B) The production team, all of it, has created ""muggle"" magic.This has it's flaws, but what film doesn't? This is a film that allows us to escape, forget our problems for a hunky fast moving 2 and a half hours, and dive into a startlingly realistic, not to mention bright and happy, world of children, magic, wizardry, and evil. I found myself applauding during the Quidditch (sp?) scenes, as if it was perfectly normal for kids to ride 70 feet in the air on broomsticks and get bruised up, that jellybeans come in every flavor (including certain excretory material, you'll see), and that kids can jump through brick walls onto a fractional train platform. What fun!Oh! For shame you critics who refuse to enjoy! This film is for enjoyment. This has lots of eye candy, beautiful stuff, dazzling stuff. But it's not at all empty. If you need serious content, I was surprised to find deep running currents, thematic elements, that are unusually mature. The pyschological effects of a child who has lived in an emotional abusive environment for years on end were well portrayed in several scenes. Borderline personalities in several characters. The age old theme of giving one's life for another; the Faustian plot of giving your soul up for personal gain; the danger of dwelling in an inate state instead of movement to some form of action; and of destiny. Pretty heavy for so called (and here paraphrased) ""hollow kid stuff"".Are you gonna listen to complaining religious fundamentalists, snobs, and critics? God Bless Harry Potter for the balm of a movie that finally isn't afraid to be what it is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Already a classic today,"I love this movie. The whole series will be one of my favorite for all times. There is so much creativity, so much atmosphere, so beautiful music in it - you simply have to love it. My god, if I would have still been a child when this movie was released, I probably would have become the biggest fan, buying action figures and the books. Sadly I am a bit too old for the movie, so the movie can't work to his full capability. But even as an adult, you will be sucked up by the atmosphere. It'll make you remember how it was to be a child.Only 9 points because the acting of the very young kids wasn't that great. - Which is totally understandable, since they have still been very young in this movie. Also I found it a bit bothering that not everything made sense. That was mainly because some stuff was left out, stuff that is explained in the books. Beside that, I have been a bit bothered by cheesy end and some cheap looking computer effects.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry Potter,"It did not take long for a book about a young wizard to turn into 7 books at 5 movies so far. And while I am not a fan of this by far, its an OK film to watch.This movie introduces the world to Daniel Radcliffe and J.K. Rowling. Radcliffe, the protagonist of this film, is a young boy who is invited to join the wizard school Hogwarts. Though he never heard about it before, he eventually gets to join despite his family not wanting him to know about it.It seems to be an adventure about finding out who his dead parents are and why they are dead. To a lesser extent, its about the stone hidden at the school. But that seems to be only a side adventure.The movie moves kind of slow at several times, but the acting isn't bad. But bearing in mind the set and the limitations of the book, it did a good enough job. Though it seems that Harry always had an exception made for him.Overall, its OK. Not great.

Approved!!!,"To start off, let me just tell you that I am a great fan of J.K. Rowlings' books and they have helped me through many a rough day during the last couple of years. The books are to my believe, in a unique top 10 of books side by side with Tolkien's masterpieces and the new book ""Artemis Fowl"" by Eion Colfer.When that said, let's get on to the film! Well.. to say at least, I went to see the film with a feeling that it HAD to disappoint me. Little did I know that I was in for a surprise...The film is - in general - a film which sticks to the story. Without mentioning the total absence of Madam Pomfrey and a too old Professor McGonagall, the story line is good. One thing you are going to enjoy is the scene with Quidditch. I mean, I've never seen effects that were that good! Brilliant!! Another thing is Dumbeldore, Hagrid and of course Severus Snape. Those three full filled my expectations and was played magnificently outstanding!All in all a great film. I will not spoil if for you, in case you have thought of going to see it. A thing, which also must be difficult, is to make a film out of a bestseller. For the crew of making Harry Potter & the Philosopher's Stone - it DID. Congratulations.

Rather good fantasy movie.,"Note, that I haven't read any of the Harry Potter books written by J.K. Rowling, so I can't really say how this movie compares with it.So, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is left to grow with his eeeevil aunt (Fiona Shaw) and uncle (Richard Griffits). They make harry do all the chores, while they pamper their own son. But Harry is not an ordinary boy: he's a wizard and he's been accepted at wizard school of Hogwarts. So of to school we go. At Hogwarts he and his friends Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) find out evil plot of Voldemort, ho wants to steal The Philosophers Stone, so he could get himself a body, him being partly dead and all.What was surprising, was that even tough the movie is full of child actors, there isn't any highly annoying case among the cast. And there are many other great actors among adults, like Richard Harris as Dumbledore, head teacher of Hogwarts and Robbie Coltrane as friendly giant Hagrid.Plot is over all very good, mixing fantasy and adventure very well. Visually movie is very good looking, but it does have some wooden looking CGI effects but fortunately they don't effect in the watching pleasure.Over all very good adaptation from the first part of very popular book series.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Very Nice,"This movie is a great piece of work. Even though some parts of the movie were changed. I was still very nicely produced.All the actors and actress played their characters beautifully.In my option, actors/actresses are supposed to make you believe that they are the character they portray, and they all did this magnificently. They gave me the since that i was in the movie. The effects could have been a touch better in my option, but of course that wont stop me from going to see the next movie. Hope this help!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Well made, but lightweight","I hate being just about the only dissenting voice, but I was not overly impressed with Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (as it is titled in the UK).I have not read the books at all, so I did not have any preconceptions about what should be in there from the book, and I didn't have any idea of the plot.Firstly, I found the movie overly long - I don't have any problem with long movies per se - as long as something is happening. There seemed to be far too much exposition, and it was over halfway into the film before a plot started to develop - and even that was quite slight. Perhaps this is because J.K Rowling was loath to lose too much from the book, perhaps they've already got the next 6 movies in mind.The adult actors are very good - Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane - are all excellent. Unfortunately the child actors are quite one dimensional, especially in their failure to show any meaningful emotion.The effects aren't brilliant, but they're generally good enough. The sets and locations are superb.Overall I found it a well made but light confection - enjoyable enough, but easily forgotten.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
please don't feed the cash cow,"There is a classic early 90's ""Far Side"" cartoon of 3 people standing in an otherwise empty room with a banner hanging overhead painted with the letters, 'DLDWWS,' which stands for ""Didn't Like Dances With Wolves Society."" Gary Larson really captured a phenomenon of what I'd call the 'societal embrace.' People look for things to identify with to make them feel like they're a part of mass culture. Enough people give this product their stamp of approval that it nearly becomes propaganda. No person can escape at least making a decision about that product. People are more likely to decide something's good if someone else tells them it's good, even though they would have felt indifferent otherwise. This cultural phenomenon has happened many times, including this year. In late 2001 and early 2002, there was no escape from Harry Potter. (pronounced 'Paw-TUH' because I've rarely heard it said otherwise. Hogwarts, Middle Earth, Ridley Scott, James Bond, Austin Powers, Shrek-talking like a stuffy brit is definitely cool again.)With that, I hereby begin DLHPSSS (Didn't Like Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone Society). The first half hour or so I found interesting. Then I noticed that the film continued to roll, but there was still no sign of an actual story. Poor cute little Harry had no objective. There was no jeopardy. Two hours in, finally, something. There's this magic stone created by the world's most powerful wizard (probably all that's preventing him from mass ridicule over being named Dumbledore), see and-oh never mind. By that time I had ceased to care. I can't remember ever caring less how a film was going to end (or wishing more that one simply would). The ending that did eventually come, frankly, sucked. Then they add to the agony by reminding us that there was the points contest between the houses. I was actually happy when the Slitherin house won. They even ruined that moment for me.On the way out, my brother, whom I saw this with, made a good analogy. He said the film was like 'Pirates of the Caribbean' or some other Disneyland ride where you just travel through and watch various animatronic things jump out at you. There's no real story, it's just a bunch of neat things to look at. Same thing with ""Harry Potter."" This is the most offensive kind of film to me, one that passes itself off as cinema, but is really just assorted eye candy. The effects and sets and cute kid actors are designed to make you feel like you've been entertained when you've really just been gypped.It's been a long time since ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" has been released, so long that I'd forgotten why I avoided seeing it in the first place. I sensed, knowing that director Chris Columbus had stayed nearly verbatim faithful to the book, that this was a cash cow just waiting to be fed. There was no risk involved for the film's creators, who knew its audience came built in. Now it's up for a Golden Laurel award, which is the Producer's Guild of America's year-end pat on the back for 'excellence in producing a motion picture,' which translates as 'best job of making lots of money on a motion picture.' (Why do movie producers need a guild? No one knows. No one wants to ask. But that's for another time.) The award should be replaced by something that looks more like the one they give the winners of the MTV Movie Awards: a gold-encrusted bucket of popcorn. ""Harry Potter"" producer David Heyman should certainly win for creating the 'movie project that moved the most popcorn at cineplexes worldwide.'I never believed in the ""Harry Potter"" propaganda and I was right. But there I was, buying a ticket anyway. I sensed a hesitation from the vendor, actually, when I heard 'Harry Paw-TUH' come out of my mouth, like he was giving me one last chance to change my mind. (""Dude, are you sure you want to see THAT movie?"") Curiosity got the best of me. My solace is that there are still a couple of people out there who haven't seen it who can still be saved. Maybe I should have seen it sooner.Grade: D",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Rich and flat at the same time (7),"Good performances from: Emma Watson did a nice job, Robbie Coltrane was very good if not under used. Alan Rickman was very good.  I am still trying to decide if I like the sidekick Ron Weasley portrayed by Rupert Grint.  Danial Radcliffe was flat.  For a lead character he just did not have 'it'.  They may have picked him for his looks but not for his star power. They really blew the casting for Harry in my opinion. There were some very good scenes but even the showstopper Quidditch match and the chess match was rushed and boring.  The scene in the forest was very good but again short. The finale I enjoyed but for some reason I kept expecting Voldewort to tell Harry he was his father.....hmmm, Ive seen that somewhere before though. Anyway. This movie gets a 7 from me just because of the attempt, stunning although cold sets and a couple of decent performances from the adults. This franchise is destined to make Billions in hype alone.

"Precious film adaptation of magical series, but may lack finer points of the story if one is a hardcore Potterfanatic!","Seeing this film makes me as giddy as a 12 year old! I, like many others, was a tad bit worried when I heard Chris Columbus was directing (being a major Terry Gilliam fan, especially), but I must say, Mr Columbus brought the book to life in a magical sort of way!  This movie is also great for filling in the seemingly endless gap between Harry Potter books.As well, I couldn't love the actors any better, especially precious Daniel Radcliffe, who's star shines brighter than a golden snitch in the sun. His ability to ""become"" Harry is completely amazing.  Of course to give credit where much is due, everyone involved did an incredible job with ""Harry Potter & the Sorcerers/Philosophers Stone"".I have no complaints of this film, and can't wait to see all the extra footage on DVD.

"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is an adventure for all ages, it's magical and remains a masterpiece","Harry Potter is something that I grew up with, movies, games and the novels but I've only read the first two. These movies for me are masterpieces of its genre, it was just great in every aspect. Some things like the special effects, visuals and sets were groundbreaking back in 2001 and it still holds up today except that I can sadly tell that it's CGI at times but I didn't mind it at all. It still has the same heart, the characters are still great, intriguing, funny and well cast. I almost remembered every single scene except for a couple minor ones, I have watched these movies so many times and I still find them enjoyable, even as an adult. Today I noticed that the movie got nominated to 3 Oscars and they were right to get nominations, the music and soundtrack by John Williams should have won as it is something unique and perfect, one of my all time favorite movie soundtracks as it just flows so well with the movie.The characters are incredible and the actors playing them is also incredible, being a child actor must be hard at times but it seems they grew up fine with being one of the most known children and teenagers on the movie screen, they did good work with portraying their characters and actually making it realistic with the bullying and such. That was something I never paid attention to before but now, the children were really bullying Hermione. She is probably my favorite of the three main characters but all three are as good, they have different flaws and unique traits and personalities that makes you fall in love with them.Edit: 25 September 2024.It was a couple of years now since I reviewed the film and I just have some other things to say. For an introduction to a franchise, this film does everything right from establishing Harry Potter in the first act and then the magical world of Hogwarts, to the mystery which has a chess match which remains one of my favorite sequences of the franchise. The narrative structure is flawless and keeps you entertained from start to finish, this was my third time watching this on blu-ray and I haven't kept track on how many times I've watched this film, it was my childhood after all. The camera work and mise-en-scene is absolutely fantastic, Chris Colombus directed every scene perfectly. The writing is also excellent and Steve Cloves went on to write the remainder of the films.

This film is very entertaining, what with its all star cast that includes, among others, Alan Rickman, Richard Griffiths (in top form) and even John Cleese. But there is one thing which drives me nuts and that is the actors who play Hermione and Harry. They are anoying and somewhat bad actors (not that I'm saying I could do better, but I probably could. Atleast I would be funny). But the one out of the three main characters who impressed me the most was Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, and another thing that drives me mad is the way that everyone criticises his acting.

"Incredible, as long as you've read the book...","After many years spent directing mediocre/awful films, Chris Columbus has finally found his fated place in cinema.  ""Harry Potter..."" (thankfully) bears little resemblance to Home Alone but is far more reminiscent of the wonderful mid-80s years when Columbus was writing the likes of ""The Goonies"", ""Gremlins"" and ""Young Sherlock Holmes"" while Spielberg produced them.  Like these older films, ""Harry Potter..."" isn't condescending to the younger audience both in its material (scary moments and violence) and its length.Columbus and Kloves clearly made the (correct) assumption that most children who see the film will have read the book.  With that in mind, they manage to cover a huge amount in the 2 1/2 hours that could well leave new-comers in the dark.  Even at this length, however, there is still a good deal missing from the film, most noticeably Peeves the Poltergeist who was cut out at the last minute.  Personally, I feel that the film could have spent a further 10 or 15 minutes showing more of the everyday life of Hogwarts covering more lesson time thus allowing for more animosity to develop between Malfoy and Harry, and between Ron and Hermione before the troll incident.  With any luck, the DVD might provide us with some of the missing material.Overall, the film has shown the potential for an incredible series which, at least for the younger viewers of today, could certainly rival the Star Wars series.  Indeed 2002 is set to stage an epic battle of sequels - Star Wars II Vs Harry Potter 2 (as well as Lord of the Rings 2).  Judging by the Phantom Menace, ""Chamber of Secrets"" is looking far more promising than ""Attack of the Clones""...",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

There are no performances, granted it would take a hell of a display to make this film entertaining, but the actors chosen don't even have a go.

a great beginning to an epic series,"'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is a film that is not only a great beginning to the HP series, but it stands up well as a family mystery film, with a few light hearted moments here and there. Add in an almost dead on adaptation of the phenomenal novel, 3 nice showings from the young kids, and an excellent supporting cast, 'Sorcerer's Stone' is a winner.Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) has always been shunned aside his whole life. His parents died in a car crash at the tender age of 1, and he's been very reluctantly raised by his aunt and uncle, Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and Vernon (Richard Griffiths). Add in their bratty son Dudley (Harry Melling), and you've got one bad childhood for young Harry. Then, one night, after days of mysterious letters from a place called Hogwarts, a giant of a man named Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) tells Harry that he's a wizard! However, Harry does learn some disturbing news along with this great news. His parents were not killed in a car crash, but murdered, by the most evil wizard in the world, Lord Voldemort, who then failed in his attempt to kill Harry, then fled, his powers mysteriously broken....Harry then comes to Hogwarts, the school for wizards, makes 2 friends, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), and later Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). He also makes his fair share of enemies, including Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), while meeting the mysterious staff and leaders of Hogwarts, including the fatherly Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris), his housemaster Minerva McGonagall (Maggie Smith), the oft-frightened Professor Quirrell (Ian Hart), and the dark and mysterious Severus Snape (Alan Rickman). Welcome to Harry's first year at Hogwarts!The film gets strong supporting performances from the adults, especially the four I just mentioned. Ian Hart gives a great performance as the always scared, extremely apprehensive Quirrell, while keeping a mysterious aura about him. Rickman is once again excellent as the most mysterious character in the entire series. Harris and Smith add the two parental figures that Harry's lacked his whole life, guiding him and disciplining him together.As this is a children's film, the fact that it stays entertaining and will keep adults interested makes it even better. It's a great film for the whole family to enjoy, with some funny moments from Rupert Grint and Richard Harris towards the end. The young children give off great performances for 10 and 11 year olds, and it's definitely a good sign for the future of the series. The direction is good from Chris Columbus, keeping it easy to follow for the kids. There are some scary moments, so I'd say kids under 8 years old could be frightened a bit. This is the only one of the Potter's that is well written, so enjoy it now. John Williams also gives a great score and a landmark theme that you'll have stuck in your head for a while. 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is a real winner for the whole family. Have fun!! 8/10 --spy",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Great Movie!!,"I thought that Chris Colombus did a great job on this movie. It stayed fairly true to the book and was entertaining all the way through! Sure they left out some stuff, but doesn't almost every movie based on a book do that? If you love the books, I guarantee that you will love this movie. Your imagination comes to life right in front of you on screen and it's just amazing to see everything you have been picturing inside your head come to life.

Great Movie!,"Harry Potter is a terrific series of books, and the movie was a departure from them.  Well and good.  There was only so much time, after all.  The scene with Dudley in the zoo... fabulous!  Seamus blowing things up left and right... terrific!  Ron was... well... Ron.  Hermione was... well... believable as Hermione.  Harry was... well... outclassed by his comrades. Apart and aside from that, great performances by Uncle Vernon, if you can believe it, and Hagrid.  Snape also turned in a stellar performance.

This is a brilliant film!,"I think this is a brilliant film! I've just watched ""Harry Potter and the deathly hallows"" and I watched the first one with my nana this morning, I only just realised how much the actors have got better through the series, I've read the whole book series and I thought they were the best books I've ever read! Anyway Back to the film recommendation, Lord Voldemort is quite frightening. His voice is terrifying and I was only 8 when I watched it with my parents, I watched it and was extremely frightened, I couldn't even sleep that night! I would recommend that if you are going to watch it with you're child tell them to close their eyes and ears until the whole bit with Voldemort in it is done, the spirit part is frightening too I would let your child/ children watch after he, Harry has been knocked out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

A Magical Experience,"The first Harry Potter film does a great job in introducing us to all the main characters that are important throughout the franchise. It is a wonderful movie that has great cinematography, surprisingly great acting coming from really young kids and just a sense of wonder, adventure and imagination throughout.I believe the movie truly is a treat especially for fans of the book, since the film is extremely faithful to it. The only real flaw I think this movie has is the fact that it was filmed during a very experimental time in the CGI-ERA and most of the CGI looks pretty bad and dated. I am not kidding there are many scenes in the movie, that looking closely, it looks just like a cartoon.However, this rather small flaw does not affect the movie's plot, nor its magic and it certainly cannot hide the fact that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is an amazing movie that introduces us to a beautiful and magical world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

We're off to see the wizards,"HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE / Starring: Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson / Rated PG / ***If you told me that the director of the 1993 slapstick comedy Mrs. Doubtfire would soon be helming the adaptation of one of the most beloved pop culture books of the late ninties, you could've knocked me over with a feather. Nor would I be able to believe that the author of the five published books would soon become richer than the Royal Family. The film was one of the most anticipated movies of the year 2001, it broke box office records, had a possible hit at the $600 million Titanic and garnered itself three technical Oscar nominations. I stated some of the things that bestowed this film, but there is much more to this, that neither movie or book has reached: This is only the empire known as Harry Potter.The phenomenon started not on screen but in the head of a single mother scribbling all of this on pieces of paper in a Scotland cafe. J.K Rowling wrote snippets and pieces of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, struggling as a mother on welfare. She had no idea that this little tale would start the biggest franchise (complete with sequels and spinoffs) since the original Star Wars trilogy. Never did she think that in years to come, children and adults around the world would be dressing up as witches and wizards awaiting upcoming stories of her character. Well, magic seemed to have struck her in the head. All of these things have happened and now a film adaptation has arrived (and no one doubted it for a second) of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. The print media was restless, critics were dying with anticipation and crowds of kids young and old are peeing in their pants. And the question comes.....Does it live up to expectations?The answer is a reassuring yes. Yes, yes, the first installment of the bespectacled boy finding out he is a wizard has been hyped by the readers, the critics, the distribution company (using $40 million to advertise it, of course) and the media, both print and televised. I had almost given up hope that the first movie based on Rowling's first novel, The Sorcerer's Stone, would live up to all these cloud-high claims. But alas! magic is in the world and has also struck me in the head! I'll say it to you once more: Harry Potter lives up to expectations. Relieved? Good, but now let's go deeper into this assured statement: Does it pass expectations? Nah, don't count on it. It doesn't go that deep!After finding out about his true roots, good lad Daniel Radcliffe, playing the 'boy who lived' himself, treks off to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry (with owl, cauldron and wand in hand). Harry believes he'll be facing school tests and homework by himself, but on the train he meets freckled Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and bossy-brainy Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). All three of these actors have exubrent talent in their character's shoes. Watson hits three homeruns as Hermione, the bookworm bent on following rules and never allowing her homework to be copied. Grint is perhaps not as delightful or as fun to watch as Watson, but the good-hearted redhead has some of the best lines in the whole movie. Consider a scene as the trio are caught in the grasps of a tendril (which you must keep very still to survive) deep inside the school. Grint's Ron is squirming, gasping and yelling for dear life as Harry and Hermione free themselves. After getting loose, Rupert hams it all up: ""Phew! Lucky we didn't panic!""But what about Harry? This mysterious, shady boy in the title role is not quite the same as his colorful comrades but more of a quiet kid in this film than he was in the book. In the book, Harry is pretty uncertain and unsure that he can live up to what everyone around him claims he is to be. He doesn't want to be famous, nor gawked at everywhere he goes. In the film, he is quiet and that's what you can only come up with at a very distance. In the distance, there really is no sense of what he actually feels like, which I really can't call a flaw. A book and a film are completely different media, and in a book you can express what Harry is feeling at every moment. You can not do that in a film. Daniel Radcliffe, however, tries to overcome this obstacle and succeeds very admirably. He is a talented young actor, and even during small facial expressions or even the tiniest piece of dialogue, you can clearly imagine what he might be feeling in the many situations in the film. You just have to look closely and that is what makes a great actor.Apart from the three main stars, the supporting cast is glittering with magical talent, but director Chris Columbus does not exactly harness the power of these gifted actors. Richard Harris sleepwalks in the role of headmaster Albus Dumbledore. In the book, Dumbledore always shows sense of great excitement or energy. Here, Harris is quite tired and may even be regretting this role, after he was forced to kicking and screaming by his grandaughter. Maggie Smith as the venerable Minerva McGonagall has her share of screen time but not enough of it. Robbie Coltrane is one of the great delights of the adults as Hagrid, slipping up important plot points and possessing a heart of gold, though he never gets enough time for himself. The best adult actor is easily Alan Rickman as the sneaky, slippery Severus Snape. I could write a whole book about everything great he has done in this movie. The film is an absolute thrill ride just when he is on screen. Rickman tries to make the best of his mere five minutes total of screentime and succeeds more than the rich CGI sequences accompaning everything.Which takes us to another star of this film (besides the title character of Harry): The computer-generated effects. The highlight of the movie is easily the almost completely computer-generated Quidditch match, that sport with three different kinds of balls and fourteen players on flying broomsticks. The digital effects in this sequence, I thought, were quite ahead of the other big budget blockbusters (namely Pearl Harbor and The Phantom Menace). It's not as zippy as I would've liked, like I imagined in it in the original novels, but it does the job well. The trouble with this sequence is that it is too short. Maybe a longer or even two of these scenes would've benefit the film a little bit more. Another big-scale sequence is the death-defying Chess Match. I'm sure it was amazing being on that huge set, but the scene is not much more than a bunch of minor explosions and large set pieces moving. What a wasted opportunity. I enjoyed the more subtle digital work (the enchanted ceiling particularly) as oppose to the heavy CGI scenes.Chris Columbus is probably the most miss-matched director for a piece of material since Francis Ford Coppola signed on for the awful Robin William's comedy Jack. He would be the last director I'd pick for a Harry Potter movie, but he does it admirably, if not inspiringly. True, his direction for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is solid, not inspired. It's probably his best-directed movie yet, but even his view can bog the film down into a more bland status. Wouldn't it be more effective to this kind of material to hire someone like Steven Spielberg or Terry Gilliam (who was up for the directing job)? They would probably be my hand-picked directors. Still, Columbus is not bad, but he is a disappointingly bland director. He doesn't let the film breathe in it's 152 minutes (which also could've been shorter) and is too tied to his source.The glaring problem in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is that though the film is advertising a magical adventure, very few ""magical"" scenes appear. In Hayao Miyazaki's animated films, 'magic' is described as real subtle element, whether it would be plucking up the spirit you lost to make things happen or even plucking up courage to stand up between the biggest of odds. In Harry Potter, most of the 'magical' scenes involve computer-generated effects. The subtle 'magic' J.K Rowling's books are standing together and trusting your friends that you can defeat all if you really believe in it. The movie is somewhat the opposite. Magic, in terms of this movie, means you must have something irregular or something odd to look at. It loses much of the subtle magic found in  countless other 'magical' films.With all it's flaws, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is solid entertainment. Not even the muggle-ized vision of Chris Columbus can spoil the book's magic. J.K Rowling's characters remain intact and so do the delightful events that affect them. I was just entertained being there, with all the children (and adults alike) pointing at screen, whispering that this must be that character or how this scene looked like they thought it would be in the book. The movie does not match by vision on how the real Harry Potter should look, but that is my problem, not yours. I kind of commend the film for that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Great Adaptation,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the best way to start off the series. The book is filled with wonderful story and great characters. I think that the adaptation of the book was almost exactly the same as the book except for two instances where Neville was either edited out or replaced with Ron. I loved this movie. I remember when it came out, I had a huge fit because I didn't see it on opening day. It was worse for Chamber of Secrets, though. I watched it again, and I noticed it went by much faster than I remembered, but I still think that this movie is a masterpiece. I think that it was cool that they got a movie release so soon after the original novel. I will always love this movie, no matter how flawed it is, although there isn't that many. It's a part of my childhood. Chris Columbus, Steve Kloves, and David Heyman were the dream team of Harry Potter. I loved this movie, flat out loved it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A pleasant paint-by-the-numbers-rendition of the book,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a fairly adequate piece of film making with some thrilling special effects;  however, it lacks the storytelling ability of the novel.  In fact, this film is proof that the depth of a novel disappears when one attempts to copy the story word-for-word, scene-for-scene. Most films adapted from novels utilize techniques geared toward ""motion picture story-telling"" which is quite different. I did thoroughly enjoy the special witchcraft effects.  I especially liked the fast and furious Quiddich game with its heart-stopping scenes that could make the Kentucky Derby look more like a tiny tots merry-go-round.The acting of the young, newcomer leads is adequate.  The adults are wonderful in their roles.  Maggie Smith deserves extra kudos for her exceptionally enchanting portrayal of Professor McGonagall. Bottom line: the film should amuse Harry's legion of readers, though be prepared to ask the question, ""Why did I enjoy the book so much more?"" Non-readers may have trouble at times with the storyline, but will probably feel satisfied that they know a little more about the wonder of Harry Potter.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

A fun introduction,"WINGARDIUM LEVIOSA!Since the whole Harry Potter movie series got added to HBO Max for a limited time, I'm going to watch all of them, and this is the first one.This was an enjoyable introduction into the magical universe. The script used the long run-time well and showed many creative ideas that had me smiling and amazed. The CGI was a bit not smooth at times, but it was still good considering the technology at the time.The main trio was also introduced, and their dynamic was also entertaining. I especially liked Emma Watson's character the most. She was clever, talkative, and quirky. And because of her confidence she didn't get too many friends, which was sad, but she's in the trio now.Since I enjoyed the magical world a lot, I honestly didn't care much about the main story of this movie. Even though there's a twist that was unexpected, I still didn't feel much about it. This movie's primary objective was clearly to introduce Harry Potter and the world he just stepped into, so the main story wasn't focused on as much.Overall, an entertaining and fun movie.

Excellent sequel,"I was entertained by the first film but I think I enjoyed this one even better. I'm not sure why, maybe because I'm already familiar with the characters so now I could just sit back and instead of trying to figure out who is who I can just enjoy the story. My favorite scene is the spiders! Terrific special effects. what a visual delight, or nightmare! And I was also feeling some sadness as I watched Richard Harris. It's not going to be easy filling his shoes with another actor. I also thought that if they are going to make two more films they had better hurry. These young actors are growing by the minute and it will look pretty ridiculous if Harry Potter needs a shave. Entertaining all the way, This film is fun for adults as well as kids.

I had read the book beforehand but the friend I saw this with had not, yet we both felt the same at the end - something was missing that's hard to pin point - something to stop us really liking the film as much as we would have hoped.

It's all about the magic!,"I will never, ever forgive myself (just kidding) if I never gave a review to this. Given though I only became a Potter fan after I watched this on DVD, I so know I have to do it.There must be something about this first instalment that it was actually being aired twice here on the television, with the latest like early last month. I watched it the first time when it was on the television. It really brought back the memories for me.Based on the best-selling debut novel from JK Rowling, it's about the adventures of Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) who realises that on his 11th birthday that he is actually a wizard from Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) who came to receive him. And a famous one, even when Harry was a year old. Thus, it became the beginning of his school life and various adventures at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Some of those people he met were like, the son of an old wizarding family- Ronald 'Ron' Weasley (Rupert Grint), the very smart witch who is actually of Muggle (non-magical people, in Potter-speak) parentage- Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), the one whom Harry soon knew will become one of those he will never always like- Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) and so on. It was because of a troll incident in the girls' toilet (yes, Harry and Ron went there to save Hermione) that Harry, Ron and Hermione became the best of friends since.Harry was also being discovered as being the youngest Seeker since a century ago as well. His 'popularity' grew. But, someone in the school does not seemed to like him at all like Malfoy. It's his Potions professor- Severus Snape (Alan Rickman). Harry, Ron and Hermione thought it was Snape who was being the bad guy in wanting to steal the sorcerer's stone.But it's someone else. Their Defense Against The Dark Arts Professor Quirrell (Ian Hart). They only found out very much later after Harry confronted Quirrell.Now, with me only being hooked on the Potter series after watching it like four years ago on the DVD, it was start of the endless magic in the series to come.

A great book squeezed into an OK film,"Making a full-size book into a film is a huge challenge. When that book is as well-known and action-packed as Harry Potter et al, the challenge looks well-nigh impossible, and so my expectations for this film started out low. Then the reviews started to come in, along with claims that the film was miraculously not bad at all. My expectations shot up again. Foolish...In brief, the film is nothing more or less than a very pretty condensed summary of the book. All the scenes are there, portrayed in loving detail, but all the character development and atmosphere of the book have been stripped away in the attempt to fit all the scenes in. Several of the actors, e.g. Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint do an excellent job, but most do not manage to develop any personality, including Daniel Radcliffe (Harry). The computer graphics are excellent IMHO although opinions vary.In retrospect it would probably not have been possible to do much better with this without seriously altering the story.

Alohomora! It opens!,"As I was watching this film, probably for the 100th time, I realised how many of the great cast had sadly passed on - Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, John Hurt, Richard Griffiths and Verne Troyer - and it reminded me that this film is nearly 20 years old!
I remember going to the cinema to see it with my Mum and insisting that she buy the books for me for Christmas, which, God bless her, she did and I devoured them, furious that the next instalment (Book 5) was still at least months away. I also insisted that she knit me a Gryffindor scarf, which she did, but I didn't know about it, because it wasn't finished until 15 years later (I'm actually always too hot to wear it, but I like that she made it for me - Don't tell her!).
I didn't realise at the time how much room Harry and his world would take up in my life. I have thoroughly enjoyed the journey alongside Mr Potter, especially with my Niece, who is quite possibly the biggest HP nerd out there (Even if she does watch it without me sometimes).As a result of that initial beginning I have always found that I read the part of Dumbledore as Richard Harris, his replacement, although very good, is not quite the wizard I read in the first 5 and later the 6th and 7th books, before Mr Harris left us and we never had that recipe again. I think he made a fantastic Albus and wish he'd managed to hold on those few more years. After all Maggie did the whole 8 films with Cancer. How very selfish of him to leave us wanting more!As a first film in a series, it's not bad and definitely gets you interested and I understand that the films/books age with Harry and the Reader/Viewer, but looking back, this film is clearly aimed at a younger audience, with some quite silly elements and characters played for laughs. In particular, I find the three leads a bit of a bunch of Goofy Goobers in the first two films and I'm delighted when they come back for year three, having clearly had some form of acting lessons, not to mention the new take on the films.
This one, however, does the job, like I say and at the time that I first watched it, I didn't think I would see a film to beat it. It's funny how quickly a film can age.
It's full of great characters, fun and laughs, interesting scenarios and definitely gets you hooked to find out what happens next. It's obvious that it's a good film, because they kept going with the rest of the series.The CGI is very much of its time and the broomstick rides especially, show up those flaws, but if you don't look to hard while you're watching it with the kids on a wet Sunday with a hot chocolate, you'll be fine.As the first film it has to set the seen for a much larger tale, which it does very nicely, while still remaining a story in its own right. If you didn't like this one, at least you have an ending, but if you want more, you can clearly see that it's on its way.Great performances by the teaching cast.

Not too magical for me...,"Consider this review for the Harry Potter epic as a whole...Perhaps it is because I am not a reader of the books, but I don't understand the Potter hype. Now, when ""The Worst Witch"" was in good syndication, I never missed a chance to catch that on TV and I've been trying to track down a video of it. In my opinion, ""The Worst Witch"" runs circles around Harry Potter and his gang. Now I understand that special effects, fancy camera tricks, and that cinematic feel is not necessarily present in ""Witch"" - BUT - lets do a little comparison, and ignore the distinct differences for right now.Many of the plot elements and characterization of ""Potter"" are almost directly taken right out of ""Witch"" -- the cursed broomstick, the flying lesson, the basic idea of witch school and the customs, the headmistress, and the potion gone wrong... etc... now, I think it's mighty fine for artists to mimic others and combine new slants with old ideas. I just think ""Witch"" did a much better job.Now I am a huge fan of simplicity and understated elegance on camera, which is evident in such adventure epics as Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and other classics that are certainly some of my favorites. But I can't stand one-dimensional characters. And unfortunately, to the credit of the younger Harry Potter actor, or his director - but probably his writer, he is as interesting as a molding peace of cheese - maybe somewhat interesting at times, but not at all appealing. And I have a lot of beef with computer generated graphics - because they do not look even remotely authentic. Spielberg's original ET is much more charming and realistic looking than his new digital one in the special release DVD, and I think even Star Wars fans can agree that the characters in the original trilogy are much easier to relate to and appreciate than the new cartoons... and Spiderman's little tricks were not that impressive... Now ""Lord of the Rings"" did prevail in the digital world... but in general, if you're going digital - get it right, or go digital all the way (like ""Toy Story"", or ""Finding Nemo"") --- Any way, I hope I'm getting my point across..Bottom line - Harry Potter is way to farcical for my taste, and while I may be enveloped in some nice suspense while watching in the theater and I enjoy a lot of the visuals and basic entertainment of it all - that is it. There is nothing below the surface here, and that bores me to death. And if like other fantasies, their was a clearer magic logic, perhaps this movie would go much further for me. For example, ""Witch"" had such a realism to it, like ""Wizard of Oz"", ""LOTR"" and ""Willy Wonka"" did - but ""Harry Potter"" just lacks that believability.If only Spielberg had directed as he was originally going to do with Haley Joel Osmant in the lead - but they had to go British, didn't they?",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the best,"Traditionally books converted to movies lose a little something in translation. I have to say that Harry Potter was one of the most faithful adaptations that I have ever seen.Its a great children's book, and a great movie. Its exciting, has a very surprising ending, and all the characterization is wonderful.The only petty criticism I can make, is that I found the CGI animation to be a lot cruder than the CGI used in other contemporary films, and much of it was unnecessary. But that is the barest of nitpicking.Its a great movie, and I'm glad its such a success.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Pretty Good, Very close to the book.","I have read all four of the Harry Potter books, and was very excited about seeing the movie, and for the most part, was not disapointed. I found it to be very fast going and completely entertaining. The acting was remarkable. All the kids looked just like they should of, and had the acting skills to match their looks. I only found a better child  actor in Haley Joel Osment. The other actors also did an excellant job, most notibly Maggie Smith, Richard Harris and Alan Rickman. Minus a few details, the movie was very close to the book...For what was there. They skipped a LOT os scenes, which is excusable, I mean, it was nearly 3 hrs as it was. One of my biggest complaints was the Visual Effects. When ever they made a character or creature completely out of Special Effects it looked horribly fake. The Ogre, Cenatour, Fluffy, Nobert, Voldermort all looked horrible. The Scorpion king form The Mummy Returns looked better then they did. I supose they weren't so bad, but after seeing Final Fantasy and movies like that, I can't help thinking of how much better they could of done them. But not all of the effects looked horrible, in fact some were spectacular, like Quidditch. It was so well done, it made me smile with gratification while watching it. The special effects, the choreography, everything was perfect. I was also very impressed by Hogwarts. The art design and special effects were stunning, esspecially when the paintings moved, very well done. I was also highly impressed by the camera work and directing of the film. The way they captured the exploding stone of the chess pieces was fantastic. Overall, very good, I just wished they put more time and energy into the special effects made creatures, but besides that, excellant.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Excellent movie, although some important book elements were missing.","I think that this is an excellent movie, although some elements of the book that should have remained, were removed.  I think that the acting was scratchy at some points (by the kids), but with future movies it will improve.  This movie is one for all ages, races and backgrounds, as it teaches the importance of friendship, loyalty, and teamwork.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Read the book first.,"To put it bluntly, the film doesn't do the book justice.That's certainly not the fault of the actors involved, all of whom do a good job - or, in the case of the perfectly cast Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane in particular, an excellent job. Other acting heavyweights like Maggie Smith and Richard Harris bring necessary wisdom and presence to their roles, while obviously having fun playing the characters. Ian Hart makes a wonderful Quirrell. Daniel Radcliffe is well-cast in the title role, and it will be interesting to see how he develops the character in future movies. In general, the cast is well chosen and works well together.It's a pity that Chris ""Home Alone"" Columbus was chosen to direct, and not someone like Terry Gilliam, Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro, or Tim Burton... all much more imaginative directors, who could fully bring the wonder of the novel to life onscreen. To be fair, as another viewer commented, Columbus restrains himself from the outlandish slapstick for which he's known.The problem with turning a book into a movie is that things like character development often suffer, as is the case here. Without the benefit of getting into Harry's head as we do on the written page, the story seems less gripping.While certainly not unwatchable or even bad, it's definitely missing some... well, some of the magic of the book (sorry) as well as a lot of its wit. The performances and the visual effects make up for a bit of that, leading to a rating of 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
It is unbelievable how many negative comments this film is getting,"I loved this movie. It was creative, and it kept my attention the whole 2.5 hours. For those of you who compare it to the book, and thus hate it, lighten up! Forget the book. You are watching a movie, and just try to enjoy that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Fantastic adaptation of a fantastic book!,"A movie could never *completely* do justice to this wonderful book, but this one comes just about as close as it possibly could!  Every character, every prop, every set, is *exactly* as I pictured it while I was reading the book. It literally felt as if the movie had jumped right out of my mind onto the screen.  From the moment Harry got on the Hogwarts Express, I just sat there with a big dumb grin on my face!  The kids are adorable, and all the acting is superb.  A *very* faithful adaptation of the book, and a lot of fun to watch.  And with a great soundtrack (of course) by John Williams, how could you go wrong?!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Pure viewing pleasure,"I agree with what scmovieguy wrote, and just want to add a few more things. (Have read all the books several times and saw the first two showings on opening day) First, I was very impressed with the performance of Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy. My impression from reading the book was that the character was a typical (cliched) spoiled rich kid; however, from this performance I began to see the way that Draco is boxed in and trapped by his influential father and wealthy family.Second, although Harry, Ron and Hermoine were all terrific (along with the rest of the wonderful cast), I was most surprised by Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley. His facial expressions and overall acting intensified and reinforced this brave, plucky character for me.Third, although I was disappointed that two of my favorite parts were cut (Peeves the poltergeist and Hermoine's poison problem-solving), the experience of seeing the movie enhanced the story for me and made me want to read all of the books again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Comments About this movie,"Over the top!!! They couldn't have picked out better actresses and actors!!! It was a beautiful performance of acting.I really liked the way Harry was brave, but yet caring. I imagined Hermione just as she was in the move. And Ron was as good as ever!!! It was great show of theatrical ability!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Do Not Waste Your Money On It,"Oh, the Show is  horrible. I read the books and expect the movie to be as nice, but the movie turned out to be really sucky.Firstly there are too many scenes, with not much detail to each scene. If you never read the book, You will probably lost. The show is going too fast.Actors = grrrr = lousy. They are lousy alright. They should never be in such a big movie. The director should have chose better actors. All the actors in the movie are lousy, if the not the worst.Background music - I dont think they put in any effort about the music. It is the same music for the whole movie. Rather annoying.Lastly, the director sucks. i dont care if he directed Home Alones, he definitely suck at these. Steven Spielberg would have done a better job. But he bowed out when JK Rowling said the actors must be British. He was right. No offence to British people.Now, i suggest you should spend money on Lord of the Ring. Wait till The Secret Of Chamber is out. Hopefully he will be in his right mind.Disappoint  -  4/10",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A great fairy tale,"I usually dont comment on films, I just give them my rating. However this film is a pure 2 and a half hours of fun. It has everything in a good proportion. It has humor, adventure, mystery and great effects. Its the first time I've seen a movie that has great special effects without the director and the producers letting all their hopes in the effects and drop other aspects of the movie (like they did in Star Wars Phantom menace). I had so much fun watching the movie that I went and bought the book so I have an opinion of how good they managed to transfer the feel of this great (I suppose) book.A definite must for every age",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
I Fell In Love For The Second Time...,"Okay, it was not quite as good as the book was. Did anyone expect it to be? In books, we use our imaginations. Movies, the imaginations are given time off. For that alone, people forget that the movies that are based on books are only certain peoples imaginations instead of our own. But I digress...The movie was utterly amazing. It had ended far too soon for me. From the beginning with Dumbledor and his amazing lighter (or is it non-lighter?) all the way to the large scale version of Wizard's Chess, this was done with such taste and was meant to please both the child and the adult. I myself went to see it with a 4 year old, a 5 year old, a 26 year old, a 45 year old, and a 75 year old. I was not alone in saying it was worth the crowds to get in. We all fell in love that day. As we did with the books years ago.For anyone reading this that is upset because of the way Harry looked or that they forgot to put in something in the movie, please keep in mind that they made it closer to the book than any movie I have ever seen or heard of and that nothing is going to be exact. Also, the movie might have been about 9 hours if they did put everything in it. So look at it as what it was intended. A Movie. Not a book.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
