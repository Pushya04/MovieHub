Aliens..My all time favourite Sci-Fi movies. It rocks!,"I have watched this movie when I was a pre-teen at the cinema, and MY! It completely blew me away. It has got my adrenalin pumping so hard that I almost wanted to slip back to my seat and take a breather! Although during that time I didn't quite understand most parts of it (too young to understand), I was deeply immersed into such rich story-telling and the fantastic alien creatures. The tensely build-up atmosphere and the space-ships, grips you so tightly it seems never to let go.This movie rocks, scares you right on to your face, very mysterious, have tons of special effects (not quite CGI though, but the mechanical aliens looks just so threatening and scary). James Cameron is such a fabulous story-teller in this Sci-Fi stellar! The movie ran at more than 2 hours but I didn't feel that at all. Actually James has cut out a lot of scenes for this theatrical release back then, but you can still get those scenes back on the DVD (extra 17 minutes footage).The acting is good especially from Sigourney Weaver, Paul Reiser and Lance Henriksen (as the robot). Sigourney's Ripley is such a strong-willed woman, that even put shame to men (somehow I feel this is quite unbelievable, because she has got so much energy, especially the scene where she gets back to the Queen's hatch to save Newt). I have watched other alien series (Alien legacy - All four parts), but I can say this part 2 of the series is my favourite, followed by Alien, then Alien:Resurrection, and lastly Alien3)I am quite happy to see this film stays high at one of the top Sci-Fi movies in IMDB)Till now as an adult, I still go back to watch this DVD occasionally and every time I watch it again, it brings in a completely new scare, and new thoughts, also the new meaning of what is a horror movie all about!Highly recommended if you haven't watched this yet. I give it an 8 out of 10! (Truly deserves the high IMDB rating at 8.2 to-date)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Gets better every time I see it,"I am just going to add my voice to the chorus of praise for this movie. It is as near to being perfect as any I have ever seen. I will not say that it is much better than Alien - which is just about near to being perfect also. But I do love all the characters in this movie. I have rarely seen a movie where all the characters were so well developed. Even most serious dramas seldom develops each character so completely. None of these characters are stereotypes even Paul Reiser as Burke, although the slimy company/government man villain is a prerequisite in disaster type movies. I would almost say that my favorite is Michael Beihn as Hicks, just because I like his work & consider him to be underrated. But I also like Lance Henriksen as Bishop, William Hope as Lt. Gorman, Bill Paxton as Hudson, and of course, Jenette Goldstein as Vasquez. I liked all of these characters. I cared about their lives & deaths. The final scene for Gorman & Vasquez still chokes me up after seeing it many times.I am not ignoring Sigourney Weaver or Carrie Henn. Ripley is the template for the modern action heroine. In the 24 years since Alien, few have been able to measure up to Sigourney Weaver's Ripley. Even in Alien 3 & 4, Ripley was still powerful, despite the 3ed rate quality of the movies. As for Carrie Henn as Newt, she was the emotional heart of Aliens. Cameron's ability to develop well rounded characters does not detract from his ability to create great action scenes or to scare the audience out of a several years of growth.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Outstanding blend of sci-fi, action, and humour.","I rate Aliens a perfect 10.  This second installment in the Alien series evolves the original movie's horror/sci-fi genre into action-adventure/sci-fi, setting a standard which has not yet been matched. I like this movie because it paints a picture of the future which is realistic enough to suck you in during the beginning of the film and then quickly introduces you to interesting characters who you become concerned with; some you love and others you hate.....but none of them bore you.  By the time the action starts it's possible to forget you're watching a movie (at least the first couple of times).  The plot is filled with tension that is occasionally broken by some of the most memorable one-liners in history (especially by Private Hudson).  The special effects are remarkable, considering the fact that they were accomplished the ""old fashioned way"" prior to digital manipulation.  I can report that I now own the Director's Cut and rate this version a 10 also.  The extra footage will be extremely interesting to fans of the 1986 release.  Either version gives you great characters, suspense, action, firepower, sarcasm, and wit.  Aliens is an outstanding show!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent sequel--matches the brilliance of the first film,"Series note: It is strongly advised that you watch this film only after seeing Alien (1979). This is a direct continuation of that story.57 years after the events of the first film, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is found and awakened from hyper sleep to discover that a terraforming colony has been set up on LV-426, the planet wherein she and her fellow crew of the mining cargo spaceship Nostromo first encountered the titular aliens. When Earth-based communications loses contact with LV-426, a band of marines are sent to investigate, taking Ripley and a representative from the company that financed the colony, Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) along for the ride.For the difficult job of following up Ridley Scott's excellent Alien, director James Cameron decided to go a completely different route--to make a fast moving, slightly tongue-in-cheek, boisterous action extravaganza. Remarkably, he was able to do that while still maintaining a stylistic and literary continuity that melds Aliens seamlessly with the first film.Ripley is much more fully developed in this film, although unfortunately, some of the most significant scenes were deleted from the theatrical release (if at all possible, watch the 2-hour and 37-minute director's cut instead). Cameron fashioned Aliens into a grand arc where Ripley's actions at the end of the film have much more meaning as she's not only fighting monsters, but also fighting to retain a semblance of something she lost due to her 57-year hyper sleep. As in the first film, she is still the most intelligent, courageous and resourceful member of the crew, but she has much more colorful company.The marines accompanying Ripley back to LV-426 may be too cartoonish for some tastes (as for viewers of that opinion, most of the action and the film overall is likely to be too cartoonish), but for anyone more agreeable to that kind of caricatured exaggeration, it's a joy to watch. I'm a big fan of both Bill Paxton and Lance Henriksen, and both turn in wonderfully over-the-top performances, at their diametrically opposed ends of the emotional spectrum--Paxton as the spastic surfer/redneck and Henriksen as the intense, moody sage, with a surprising reality and an even more surprising conscience to go along with it. We also get a cigar-chomping Sergeant, a crazy, butch Private, and a complex, pensive Corporal as main characters, and a mysterious, bright young girl (played in a terrific performance by Carrie Henn). Much of the center section of the film hinges on the interrelationships of these characters, despite the action trappings going on around them.Cameron carries over the crypt/labyrinth motif of the first film, and adds a metaphorical descent into the bowels of hell in the climax. The action throughout is suspenseful. Aliens contains one of my favorite ""cat fights"" in any film. It's also worth noting the influence this film may have had on Paul Verhoeven's Starship Troopers (1997)--although admittedly, we could say that Cameron was influenced a bit by the Robert A. Heinlein book, as well. Throughout all of the varied action sequences, as well as the important early scenes of colonists on LV-426, Cameron is able to clearly convey the logistics of very complex sets, so that viewers remain on the edges of their seats.Part of what makes the monsters so effective is that we're not told too much about them. We only get glimpses into their physiology's, their behavioral patterns and their intelligence. Cameron gives us just enough to become wrapped up in the film, but not so much that we become overly familiar with the aliens, or start to question the logic behind the film. He also smartly carries over some devices from the first film that were abandoned to an extent, such as the acidic blood of the aliens, and he supplies answers to the few questions that the first film raised, such as why the blood doesn't corrode instruments and objects when a dead alien is examined.Aliens is yet another example of a sequel that is just as good as an original film in a series. Just make sure you watch both in order, and try to watch the director's cuts.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This ain't a film.,"THE sci-fi movie. It's nearly perfect in every way: storyline, characters, menacing threat, suspense, action, direction, music, emotion, etc... It's always been a favorite of mine and still is. To me this is not just a film, it is an experience. The adrenaline pumps like in no other film and rarely have we had the chance to see a heroine as compelling as Sigourney Weaver. She can kick anyone's ass and still keep a heart and soul. (Why she didn't win the Oscar back in 1986 is beyond me.) When the action starts, you're in for the ride of your life. Truly a milestone in movie making. Now if they could only release it on DVD...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the most thrilling films ever- special edition highly recommended,"James Cameron is an extremely talented action director because not only does he know great action, but he always backs the action up with a great story and interesting characters. Aliens is his finest achievement, as far as I'm concerned. Of course, I should specify: Aliens Special Edition is his finest achievement.In 1986 several scenes were cut to keep the movie's run-time reasonable but there was one scene that was incredibly foolish to leave out. The scene I refer to is near the beginning where Ripley learns that her daughter has died while she was away in 'hypersleep' for 57 years. ""I promised her I'd be home for her 11th birthday,"" cries Ripley. This is a very moving scene that adds a great deal the character's depth and makes more sense to why she cares for a little girl named Newt later in the film. She's seeking penance through Newt with her love and determination to keep her alive at all costs. The theatrical edition obviously doesn't elude to any of this, and even cheapens the relationship between Ripley and Newt- just a little bit. James Cameron has said that all of his movies are love stories, and Aliens is a story of parental love. He has also said that the special edition is his intended (if not definitive) version of the film. For about five years or so the Special Edition was the only version of Aliens you could get on DVD. It should have stayed that way.Aliens is a unique film experience: it's genuinely thrilling and exciting, unlike a lot of movies where people shoot the evil monsters and there's disgusting blood and rapid gunfire, and it's really meaningless. In Aliens' case, the aliens are very threatening and more than just target practice. We don't see any aliens for over an hour, but once we do, it's a huge payoff. By that time, we get to know some interesting characters: Hicks (Michael Beihn), a take-charge marine who also turns out to be sweet and sincere, Hudson (Bill Paxton), a braggart who turns out to be a coward and complains most of the time, Vasquez (Jeanette Goldstein), the iron-willed woman soldier who proves to be one of the bravest characters in the film, Bishop (Lance Henrikson), a robot that is very helpful for everyone's survival, Burke (Paul Rieser), the slimy company man who the audience loves to hate, and of course, the adorable little Newt (Carrie Henn), a girl who has survived unspeakable horror. Holding the whole film together is Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver in her surprise-Oscar-nominated performance. I think the only reason why the audience cared for her in the first film is because she was the only person left and we wanted her to live. But for this film, James Cameron added so much to her. With all this investment in characters, we're really concerned for their well-being. We don't want those aliens to get them. Some die, and I'm always truly bummed out when it happens.Filled with amazing performances and an abundance of thrills, Aliens is one of the greatest of any genre it attempts: whether it's action, sci-fi, horror, or even drama. I personally liked it better than the first film, but it's really like comparing apples and oranges. I prefer the special edition and don't see why anyone should view the other version instead.My rating: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the best films ever made.,"So often when you think of sequels you imagine cynical attempts to cash in on successful movies, efforts to bring in the coins with any old rubbish, when you think of the likes of Police Academy, Halloween and Jaws you can understand why, and then there is Aliens......Not often is a follow up as good as the original (and better in some ways,) but Aliens is, I would class it as one of the best movies of all time, a cinematic Masterpiece which seems to improve with age. It's a space horror, which is dramatic, action packed and funny at times.Aliens changed the genre, sci fi would never quite be the same again. This film will have you gripped, glued and on the edge of your seat, truly an adrenaline fuelled thrill ride, with amazing visuals, wonderful acting, and terrific music. Film makers of today watch and see how it should be done.A masterpiece. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Americanization of Alien,"James Cameron's sequel, simply put, lacks the style and depth of detail of Ridley Scott's original. It's also sadly Americanized. Wisecracking Marines with big, jutting guns, cigars, and knife games. A swarm of aliens instead of one solitary killer. Ambitious, mouthy, corporate go-getters. In other words, indulgence where Scott practised restraint ...And, of course, space travel has changed between 1979 and 1986. Oh, you're still put into hibernation but, in this episode, space is of little consequence, it seems. Yet in the first movie, everyone hated hibernation and space travel was a long, drawn-out trip! The crew in _Aliens_ flits about as if they're heading across town to kick some butt.Seems Cameron just couldn't resist putting his personal stamp on the film (and stamping out Scott's vision). He even glommed a scene from _2001_ and stuck it right at the beginning of his film.Cheap sci-fi action garbage with all the TRUE suspense taken out. _Alien_ was a higher standard than that. Cameron, you were out of your depth.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
James Cameron and Bill Paxton at their finest,"There are really good movies and then there's that select few that change your life.  For me movies like Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, JFK, Titanic and Star Wars did that.  By viewing a movie you see life in a different light.  Aliens also did that to me.  I didn't think a movie could scare me as much as Halloween did but this one certainly did that and more.  The atmosphere in this movie, and the lighting and cinematography and of course the direction are top notch, and some of the scenes are some of the scariest I've seen in my life time.  But what puts this movie over the top as one of the all time greatest films ever made is the casting.Sigourney Weaver is terrific but it is her supporting cast that shines and makes you feel like you know the crew that is heading to that desolate planet.Paul Reiser is perfect as Burke,the slimy corporate kiss ass that cares about profit before human lives.  Lance Henriksen shines as Bishop, the cyborg with a heart.  Jeanette Goldstein is the rough around the edges female marine that more than holds her own with all the testosterone floating around and Michael Biehn ( another Cameron favourite )is the perfect quiet leader that leads by example and not so much a loud demonstrative voice.  But the show stopper in this flick ( just as he always is in any movie that he is in ) is Bill Paxton.Paxton and Cameron have worked on Terminator 1, True Lies, Titanic and Aliens and Bill is one of those actors that steals scenes from every actor and was always a recognizable face even before Titanic.  Here, his Hudson character is the comic relief but he is also perhaps one of the true characters that we can all identify with.  His tough exterior is nothing more than camouflage for his frightened fragile interior.  He realizes the dire situation that they are all in and he can't hide his fear.  When he finds out that they won't be rescued for at least seventeen days, his response is "" Hey man, we're not going to survive 17 hours man!  Those things are going to come in here and they're going to get us and..... "" ( Ripley ) This little girl survived longer than that with no weapons and no military training. "" ( Hudson ) "" Why don't ya put her in charge!!! ""Paxton is a gift to any and every movie that he is in and this is his finest work.  He should have won a best supporting actor that year.  And if you haven't seen this movie, rush to see it if only for Bill Paxton.  He steals the show.  But if a tightly wound, brilliantly technical and unbelievably scary movie is your thing, then you can't go wrong here.  This is easily a ten out of ten, and one of the best ever made.  If Spielberg is the king is Hollywood, then Cameron is his heir apparent.  Oh, and one more thing, Paxton will win an Oscar one day.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I'm in the minority.,"After a brilliant ,claustrophobic and atmospheric first film , Mr. Cameron takes the Alien franchise into the realm of what would become the fail safe formula of success for action movies . He does this a full decade or even two before it becomes the norm for every action film for decades after its 1986 release. For any other franchise this would be good. But after a Sci-Fi/Horror classic original, the second film is horribly dated and predictable. Cameron removes all the horror out of the film and replaces it with an all out assault on the viewers senses. He even changes Rippleys character from a sensitive but strong survivor female lead to an alpha female , who can do no wrong, including out boxing a natural predator while controlling a bulky and clumsy metal machine body crane. The first film appeals to all demographics while the second is an unapologetic attempt to appease the testosterone filled 20 year old audience. Everything plays second fiddle to the action including the cinematography, set design, acting and even the Alien, hince the need for multiple Aliens. It is simply TOO EPIC ,with too much action and having too much ego.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""I knew you'd come...""","ALIENS really does have it all.  Perfect direction.  Beautiful cinematography.  Intense characters.  Big guns.  Action.  Heroism. Courage.  Battles.  Friendship.  Bravery.  It is certainly the BEST sequel ever made in movie history, and one of the GREATEST MOVIES EVER MADE.At its core is Lt. Ellen Ripley (played by the badass Sigourney Weaver), a warrant officer, and tough as nails.  Her character is one of the greatest heroines of all time.  Sigourney really does pull it off.  No one else could have done it like her.  Ripley's maternal connection with the young girl Newt is amazing to watch...but the ultimate scene is her final battle with the galaxy's most deadly creature - set to a pulsing military score (James Horner delivers in a big way!).  Quite possibly my favorite fight scene of all time.There's not really much else to say - just go watch the movie on DVD, and you will not be let down.

A milestone in movie making....,"Just recently, I have purchased the new Alien Legacy box set on DVD, and each one is excellent. Aliens is the second chapter in the Alien saga and is probably the most remembered by today's generation. Let's face it; it changed the way sci-fi movies were made forever,and it hasn't been for the best(I'm not saying Aliens is a bad film). Aliens set such a high standard in action sci-fi(basically the new genre the James Cameron has created) that none of the copycats can compete. Take the recent movies Soldier and Event Horizon(both directed by Paul Anderson). They both try to be Alien movies but do not succeed. My advice to Mr. Anderson is to stop trying to copy what has already been done. Enough said.As for Aliens, it is a perfect sci-fi action movie. Great casting(although ALL are stereotypes), great music(James Horner is the man), great use of technology and  a well written script are all present. Weaver's performance is outstanding; one of the best action heroes of all time just happens to be a woman. If you have a chance to watch the director' cut of Aliens, I suggest you take it(it's available in the new Alien Legacy box set or alone on DVD and VHS as well as on laserdisc). It expands on Ripley's maternal persona which makes Weaver's performance all the better.James Cameron came off making The Terminator and made Aliens. He used his expertise in the sci-fi genre and created an engrossing story that does not let up until the final reel of the film. For all the young folk out there that have not seen this film, watch it and see perfection in action movie making. A must see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good strong sci-fi action movie,"Ripley and Jones are rescued, but 57 years have past and humans now colonise the planet where the original Alien was found.Can the Company get a crew of Marines out to the planet in time to save them? Can they survive themselves?After being awoke from such a long hypersleep, Ripley's life is very different. The Company does not believe her story and she is striped of her profession. Even all her family have now passed away. She finds herself tortured by nightmares.When the Company loses contact with the colony, after sending some colonists to investigate Ripley's story, they have a change of heart and send the crack Marines in to rescue the colonist but need Ripley's knowledge.She eventually, reluctantly joins the trip as an advisor, as long as they kill the creatures they find.When the team find that the colony is completely overrun with the creatures, survival becomes the only concern.Strong sequel. Very different in mood, deliberately, as they move into a sort of siege story and the hide and seek of the first drifts away.As a result this is a less effective horror story but is a very effective grownup sci-fi movie.Although the Marines are all stereotypes, and they have the minimum required to cover all the options, they are well acted and the action is well paced.Sigourney Weaver's second outing as Ripley allows the character greater depth and flexes some different acting muscles too. There is a believable set of relationships and dynamics between Ripley and the other characters, especially young ""Newt"", played by Carrie Henn. Indeed, the child steals many scenes from the more established actors.Lance Heinrikson and Michael Biehn are always good to watch but Bill Paxton is superb as the 'comic relief' Hudson. Paul Reiser, very popular at the time, pulls in the slime as the Company man looking to make his fortune - at any cost.The effects are good and the sets again very believable. The final showdown again grips.Although this is a very effective sci-fi action movie it is not a traditional horror, lacking the menace of the original.Things to look out for: nightmares, inquiry, queen alien, grunts, Newt, loads of one liners, another android.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best Sci Fi action flick ever made,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? Every aspect of this movie is spot on, which I can only put down to James Cameron's obsessive attention to detail. The characters are distinct, memorable and believable. The plot builds slowly into the most tense, suspenseful roller-coaster ride I've ever experienced in the cinema. The special effects are good even by today's standards, and the sets are simply second to none. This is one of my top 10 favourite movies of all time.If you like this kind of movie and haven't seen this yet, what are you waiting for? Twenty years on and the only other Sci Fi action movie in the same league is James Cameron's Terminator 2. I can only hope he returns to this genre in the future, he is the master.Oh, and try to see the special extended edition if possible, the extra scenes make an amazing movie even better.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
All-time classic; one of the greatest films ever made,"What more can be said that hasn't been said before about one of the greatest movies of our time? One of Jim Cameron's top three films, this is by far the best of the ALIEN saga, an endlessly rewatchable piece of classic action cinema which can best be described as ""Vietnam in space"". The alien is back and has multiplied, so now we have the now-classic action premise of ""group of marines vs. invincible enemy"".From start to finish this is perfectly made entertainment with every frame minutely conceived to be the best. The music is eerily gripping and there are dozens of one-liners to be had from Bill Paxton, excelling in his first big role as the comic relief. The horror and gore quotient hasn't been reduced at all, this is definitely not a film for the kids. But oodles of gripping suspense and guns-blazing action violence is the main thing this sequel offers and it still remains one of the best action classics of our time. Even now, when some of the special effects are starting to look a little ropey (most remain fantastic, however, especially the Queen) and when you begin to realise there are no more than six aliens on screen at one time, this is still pulse-pounding entertainment, packed with horror, suspense, tension and plenty of thrills.The cast is efficient, an ensemble outfit that pays off nicely. Sigourney Weaver puts in her best performance in her best role that she can never hope to better success-wise. Michael Biehn is the hard-but-human soldier who befriends her, Lance Henriksen has his mainstream breakthrough role as the likable android Bishop. Paul Reiser's Burke is one of the greatest portrayals of corporate evil I've seen, a fantastic show of strength, corruption, evil and cowardice from Reiser. The rest of the marines are great and, most importantly, believable and likable. The action never lets up and the extended version has to be seen to get the full story. Although it runs for two and a half hours this is a film that never runs out of steam; instead it will just age gracefully like the finest wines, sitting in its place in history as a classic of the '80s.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Quite Good, but not of the caliber of the original.","I have been long a fan of the orignal ""Alien"", but somehow I never saw this sequel until now. If this were in fact the first or only ""alien"" movie, I would undoubtedly rate it higher than I do. It's edge of your set, exciting, and much better than most movies of this type. The special effects are great, and there are some real scary moments.But to say this is ""as good"" or ""beter"" than the original--that I cannot agree with.First of all, there is very litte original in this sequel. Indeed, it is more of a remake of the first Alien than a progression. The plot if very similar, and indeed, the ending is basically the same idea, right down to Sigourney Weaver in her underwear. So the mere fact that is not original is to be considered. What Aliens offers over Alien, is faster pacing, more and bigger aliens, and a generally higher adrenaline level. This is probably why a lot of people prefer it. And it is all very well done.But Aliens is basically a military shoot-em-up. The original, for all its comparative simplicity, is a much more subtle, deftly constructed, and very atmpospheric movie.  The spareness creates a feeling of claustrophobia and terror which is very effective and memorable.  I found Alien truly psychologically frightening, while Aliens is more of an in your face adrenaline rush.  Alien also has a more interesting cast, more human and subtle. The military posturing of the Aliens cast was pretty standard stuff. Sigourney Weaver, of course, is possibly even better than in the first movie. I also like the music in the first movie better.I find Leonard Maltin's comment on the Alien inexplicable. What he seems not to like about the first movie is there in spades in the second movie.Aliens is a darn good movie, but Alien is a sci-fi classic.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Make it a 7.5, and just don't think too hard!","When I recently revisited this film I was underwhelmed. I don't think I've sat through it a second time since it was in theaters in 1986. I remembered it as a great action film and it is still a great action film.The main problem that I had - the problem I have with most James Cameron films - was the dialogue. He writes lines for these characters like they are caricatures rather than actual people. The proceedings come off shrill where the original Alien was a masterpiece of originality - monsters with acid for blood so you can't even kill them without killing yourself and destroying your spacecraft. At least I can't complain about the lack of originality of the material, because Cameron is writing and directing a sequel here.It almost singlehandedly created the aesthetic of the ""space marine,"" which makes it really hard to not see their behavior as cliche, even if it did create the cliches. I also get that their macho posturing is supposed to contrast with
how quickly they dissolve under pressure, but that isn't really a particularly fascinating character or plot development. You know from the start that they don't have a clue what they are getting themselves into. Did they not read Ripley's report like they were instructed to do? Yet not a one says ""Yikes!"" prior
to first engagement with something that is not your typical big bad.And the cliched mother/daughter relationship just springing up between Ripley and Newt is rather grating on the nerves too. I've never watched the extended version, but apparently Ripley had a daughter in the extended cut of Aliens who grew to adulthood and died during the 57 years Ripley was ""lost in space"".
That would have had this spontaneous maternal reaction make more sense.Cameron hits all of the tent pole emotional triggers - although he does it completely without nuance - the evil corporation that is just too big, prejudices accepted in an earlier era going out of fashion, and some people deserve to be rescued while others do not???? Oh, well, it is a great thrill ride. Cameron always does that well, and does it well enough here to make the film a suspenseful rollercoaster as long as you don't think too hard.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

She and a team of space marines must battle the aliens in an all out fight.James Cameron has taken this franchise from its horror origins to a great big action adventure. The change in style is seamless. The action is perfect, and it's a non-stop roller coaster ride. Ripley has transformed herself from the feminist icon into a powerful mother figure. There isn't a false note in this movie. The characters are all well drawn from the humanist robot Lance Henriksen to the comic relief Bill Paxton.

"In space, nobody can hear you s**t your pants","57 years ago Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) was part of the Nostromo spaceship's crew that encountered a terrifying alien, as the last remaining member of the crew she has drifted through space in hyper sleep. Awake and alive nobody believes her, so she is asked upon to support a Colonial Marine outfit as they go back to Moon LV-426 - a now colonized moon where the original Alien came from. They have recently gone dark and potentially abandoned the moon, and the authorities want to know why. The Colonial Marines are outfitted with state of the art warfare machinery and an arsenal to potentially deal with any threat.This is an amazing film - on par, if not better than the first in the series. It takes concepts from the first film, and then changes the approach and dynamic of the plot - expanding the universe in which the story unfolds. Some sequels just re-hash what came before them; this takes the original and does an A-Team transformation on it, attaching guns, lasers, nitro, bells and whistles. The end result is a genre bending action horror sci-fi chase war thriller masterpiece. There are explosions, special effects, gorgeous cinematography and mise-en-scene, great plot, thrilling story, top actors delivering excellent performances, scares, frights, fights, character development - oh believe me, I could go on singing the praises of this film. When James Cameron was given the reigns to this after Ridley Scott's seminal ""Alien"" film a lot of film-goes where dubious - but given the proof of the ""Terminator"" movie, Cameron had the pedigree to be successful and boy did he deliver! Not just a tour-de-force of a visual spectacle, but also a film lecturers dream as the material further promotes lots of themes and discussions - none more than the heroine who is the vehicle for plot. If the first film made people look at Sigourney Weaver differently, this film went a long way to elevating her star power as she totally flipped action hero conventions on their head - to this day her performance is still synonymous with being a major player in the change from masculine dominated cinema. The matriarchal bond shown between Ripley and Newt is great, the character development goes some way to showing an attempt to fix the fragility of the broken bond exemplified at the start of the film when it becomes clear that Ripley's own biological daughter is resentful of the unjustified absence of a mother. Another well documented discussion this film birthed deals with the parallels to war films, and in particularly Vietnam themed war film - however rather than shoehorning academic thesis' into this review I'll just say that the film did more than just entertained, it became an icon in cinema.I seriously cannot give this film less than 10 out of 10. It scared, thrilled and entertained me as a child when I watched it (admittedly under the legal age), and it still keeps a smile on my face as I watch it as an adult.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Hands down one of the best sequels ever!,"Back in 1986, sequels had become very common (Superman, Star Wars, Indiana Jones), yet people were suspicious when they heard of a follow-up to Alien, Ridley Scott's acclaimed sci-fi horror from 1979. Most of the criticism was aimed at the fact that Scott had nothing to do with the new movie, which had been entrusted to an unknown (at the time) named James Cameron. Fortunately, Cameron had shown he knew the genre two years earlier with The Terminator, and by perfecting the skills he had developed on that film he delivered Aliens, which still stands out as one of the greatest science fiction flicks of all time.Given how the first film ended (all characters but one died), Cameron wisely decided to radically separate his movie from the original, and he does so from the very beginning by having Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) wake up from her cryogenic sleep and make a shocking discovery: although she hasn't aged at all, 57 years have passed since she left the Nostromo, meaning everyone she knew is either dead or very old (in a particularly heartbreaking scene, she talks on the phone with her grown-up daughter, who is full of resentment for her ""unjustified"" absence). In addition, no one believes her story regarding the alien since, as she's told by scientist Carter Burke (Paul Reiser), the planet where these creatures allegedly lived has been successfully colonized. Suddenly, though, all communications with LV-426 are inexplicably interrupted. Thinking there might be some truth to Ripley's tale, Burke asks her to join him and a group of soldiers on a mission to uncover the mystery. And while most of the participants are in it just for the money, our heroine realizes this is her only chance of confronting her worst nightmare and overcoming it for good.The main problem with Alien, some have said, was that, as great as it can be, the characterizations were reduced to the minimum (not that it really mattered, with Ridley Scott ensuring the film retained the right pace and suspense throughout). With Aliens, character development is the last thing fans should worry about, Cameron being fully aware of each individual's potential and exploiting it as much as he can. Ripley, who was just part of an ensemble in the original, is now allowed to carry the whole film, and boy, does she carry it: rarely has there been a more solid, compelling female role in a genre movie like this (the fact that Sigourney Weaver is the only actress, thus far, to have received an Oscar nomination for a science-fiction film is further testament to Aliens' immortality). The supporting cast is equally good, with a multitude of different characters ranging from funny (regular Cameron collaborators Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton) to weird (Lance Henriksen's android Bishop) and bringing something extra to the movie's unique atmosphere.Ah, the film's mood: that's the other aspect Cameron deserves all the credit in the world for. On a superficial level, it could be said Alien was a horror movie, while the follow-up is more action-oriented; that may be true, but one should also notice that every single spectacular battle scene actually oozes tension, never leaving the audience with a pause to breathe or relax. In fact, Cameron has succeeded where many other directors would have failed: he stayed faithful to the original's tone, but managed nonetheless to make the film undeniably his own.Relentlessly creepy, occasionally very violent and consistently compelling, Aliens is a pitch-perfect piece of adult science-fiction. Watch it on a double bill with Scott's version and you will get four hours of genre film-making at its finest.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best of Sci-Fi Action,"Aliens is one of many movies from my adolescent years that is just as good today as it was back then. It is an adrenaline filled ride filled with creepy locations, intense action, thrills, much circumstantial humor and one-liners that will never grow old (mostly thanks to Bill Paxton). It is, unapologetically, a man's movie, filled with everything except nudity (which it did not need).All movies in the Alien series have a claustrophobic feel to them, and involve a relatively small cast of players. Aliens is no exception and really capitalizes on the fear potential of the locale. Cameron is not exactly known for injecting horror into his films, but provides enough here to satisfy.The characters are very well cast and the actors have great chemistry. I especially grooved to the fact that, even though the soldiers are supposed to be tough marines, not all of them were completely gung-ho about their adventures. In fact, a few were downright cowardly and indecisive in the face of combat - something I'm certain would happen to many in such a situation. Bill Paxton stole the show as the wisecracking space marine. With all the likable characters involved, the stakes were very high. When they start dropping, we feel the loss.Movies like this just don't come around very often. The pacing is very tight, even when the action is absent. The characters and situations are interesting enough - when the action hits, it just serves to suck us in deeper. I have nothing bad to say about Aliens. It is simply an awesome movie with a well deserved reputation for being such. See for yourself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Aliens (1986) Better than the first movie?,"There is a question among many people: Is Aliens (1986) better than Alien (1979)? I already advance that I don't think that and I don't think it comes close to being better. They are two films on completely different levels. Does that make this a bad movie? No way. Aliens is an excellent film with wonderful production design. Visually it's spectacular, and that's to be expected for a James Cameron film. His direction works very well and many scenes are striking and tense. The movie isn't bad at anything it does or tries to do, but it isn't perfect at those same things. The script is very good and the story is very well developed, but perhaps for the first one being simpler and in a more closed environment makes it better. Some characters don't work so well and you don't sympathize with them, making it just boring. Overall, it's an excellent film that looks amazing, but it's no better than its predecessor.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A functional plot built up with the most vivid and beautiful and demonic effects,"Aliens (1986)I had a revealing experience these last two days. I heard ""Aliens"" without watching most of it (I was in the other room). And the script is really really bad. I mean stupid bad, with these quasi military people fighting against the monsters and saying canned military things that are taken not from real army dialog but from other movies. The events really boil down to a series of missteps, and even though this band of Marines is made of tough ""hombres"" sure enough, they can't seem to get along, or get things done, or even hold their overly heavy weapons up straight.I did watch for part of it, and I have seen the movie more than once before, and I'm a fan of the first one, ""Alien,"" from 1979 (on the heels of the ""Star Wars"" craze). I expected it to be pretty good, like the first one, which has real character development and an original kind of premise. But...well, think again.Hey, I agree with most--the set design, the sense of action, the light and camera-work, the whole larger than life experience of being in this forbidding place, this is all great. Even the over the top ""movie music"" is appropriately symphonic and big. There's no way around the fact the movie is well made, and feels convincing in these palpable terms. It looks great top to bottom, and even on contemporary terms (we are a quarter century later as I write), it is sophisticated. It has aged well. If that were all that mattered--and for some it might be!--then all is well.But for me, I was still thinking there might be some interesting, chilling plot to follow. This second installment, always confusing in its plural title ""Aliens,"" is filled with a combination of stale ideas (taken politely from the first round) and romping action adventure boy stuff. It is if more intense than the first (more fighting, more firepower), but it's far less creepy. It has more goo, and more gore, but less horror, and less fear.As with the original, the lead character is a woman, and indeed a whole bunch of the Marines are women, and so this is no simple manly movie. But it remains a macho movie, or a ""machisma"" one, and that will suit many viewers fine. But if you are remotely interested in the science fiction aspects, or even the terror of the first movie (which was truly terrifying), you might be disappointed to find you are continually battered instead. It's great battering, but if you actually listen to the dialog (when there is any--the best parts of the movie are merely sounds), you'll see what I mean.James Cameron, the director here (and not the director of the first one, which is credited to the more original Ridley Scott), does the famous Cameron thing, playing a kind of ""Star Wars"" game of making an epic suited for about a 17 year old. Not that older people (and younger) can't enjoy it, but movies have their target points, and that's it here. You can see it in the dialog and plot, of course, but also in the overall feel of things, which is a combination of early computer games (1986 is a long time ago in those terms) and swashbuckler classics. It's a vivid, fast movie.You will notice, in retrospect, some ""Avatar"" features that are interesting, beyond just Sigourney Weaver. Foremost, this is a military affair, very right wing, go-get-em stuff, but with the admirable (American) rise of the individual above the chaos of both internal logistics and the logic of the evil outer world.The monster? Monstrous. The famous designer H.H. Giger is not involved here except by carryover from the first. It's a good thing he was the originator because the basic visual and sculptural quality of the monster, the planet, the ships, and the sets, is under Giger's brilliant sway, and is a defining quality of the film. It makes no biologic or engineering sense, but so what? It looks great.In all, clearly, there are amazing things here, taken on their own level. But there are discouraging ones, too, for those who are willing to pay attention. The little blonde girl at one point says, ""Mommy...I mean Ripley, I'm scared."" And Ripley (Weaver) says, ""I know, Honey. Me, too."" That's the core of it all. Don't forget your grenade launcher.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Too much action, too little atmosphere","For me, 'Aliens' doesn't come close to its grandiose predecessor. In short, the reason for this is the lack of atmosphere. The first part shone through the certainty of the unknown. Sure, you didn't know what you were dealing with, but the whole way the eerie creature from a foreign world was staged and introduced to the viewer was brilliant.The sequel, of course, has the problem of some knowledge about the alien, which in turn means that the story has to be approached ""differently"".The first point that bothers me are the soldiers brought into the game. They are bursting with testosterone and try to outdo each other with churlish, clumsy and cliché-laden oneliner. There I was actually disappointed, because I had hoped the gloomy mood from the first part is continued. But then I knew the movie would probably be a completely different one.In the second section, 'Aliens' drifts into an action movie and consists to a large extent only of shooting interludes, in which an even bigger gun is unpacked. The entire location would actually provide an ideal basis for a thriller peppered with horror elements. But the setting can't work reasonably and can't spread in the viewer's mind.Towards the end, the movie really picks up speed and this section is also really good. This is mainly because the movie returns to the basic elements of its predecessor and focuses more on suspense and atmosphere. In addition, this is also because Ripley comes back more into the center. Ripley was a highlight in the first part and is again in the second.Overall, you have to say, sequels always have a hard time, 'Aliens' has tried to go new ways, has done that basically well, unfortunately it does not come to the genius of the first part. And without the fabulous last third, 'Aliens' would have been just a normal action movie for me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Every bit as good as Alien,"Alien is a sci-fi classic, so when I saw Aliens I was expecting great things. Which is exactly what I got. Aliens I have often seen and heard being described as one of the best sequels ever made, and I have to heartily concur. Aliens is every bit as good as Alien, and just a brilliant film. The production design once again is immaculate with the spectacle surpassing Alien(to me), while the script is credible, the story interesting and well-constructed and James Cameron's direction brilliant. As with Alien, there are also some very genuine shocks and scares, and if there was something I marginally preferred here it was the suspense which was particularly nail-biting. The acting once again is top notch, all the supporting cast do great work but Sigourney Weaver is simply terrific and it helps that Ellen Ripley is expanded upon here. Overall, just like Alien, a sci-fi classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not nearly as good as the first one,"Sequels are often hated with a passion. All sorts of action packed movies usually find a sequel - Batman had his, as did Superman. So did the 1979 classic science fiction thriller Alien, directed by Ridley Scott.Aliens, a catchy name for a sequel, was directed by James Cameron, who two years earlier directed the hit action science fiction movie Terminator with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Cameron, an action director, obviously had a lot to say in the production. So why didn't I like it as much as the first one?Number one has to be the cast. The cast in the first was a small one, maybe ten actors at tops, but they were all awesome. Weaver was much different, although I have no complaints about his work in the sequel. The cast in the second one I found really irritating, although many have loved Bill Paxton ever since, I found him annoying. As for Michael Biehn and Lance Henriksen, I have no complaints, they did a marvelous job. But the woman who played Vasquez, and the whole character of her's was just bad.Number two would have to be the way it's directed. It's no longer a science fiction movie, it's no longer a thriller or even a horror movie, it's an action movie, with lots of explosions and weapons and fire and all that. I was disappointed with the whole plot outline, the whole movie has just been constructed around battle scenes that many people appreciate. But not I.As a sequel that's been praised through the roof by so many, I have to say that the prequel once again triumphs. Scott's direction is much more beautiful, the cinematography is better, the score is better and the movie is scarier and more scientific as a whole than this one. I gave this one a six, I think I gave the first one a ten. But just to end this review, I highly recommend this to the people that like to find out what happens after the first one and to those who like action movies with some spooky scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Compelling, far superior sequel to sci-fi classic (8/10)","Seven years after barely surviving events on board the Nostromo in Ridley Scott's classic sci-fi horror ALIEN, Sigourney Weaver reprised her role as Warrant Officer Ripley for one of the most compelling and critically-acclaimed sequels of all time.  Canadian director James Cameron had already struck gold with the Arnold Schwarzenegger starring vehicle THE TERMINATOR (1984), after his somewhat inauspicious feature film directorial debut with the long-forgotten, Dutch-backed PIRANHA II: THE SPAWNING 3 years earlier.  ALIENS would further cement Cameron's growing reputation as a first-rate director of high-tech, fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping action thrillers, from which there would normally be no let-up once they got going.When Ripley is rescued from drifting aimlessly through deep space, she is horrified to learn that not only has she been asleep for 57 years, but the planet on which she had encountered the original alien all that time ago has since been colonized.  At first no-one will heed her warnings or completely believe the story she gives at an official enquiry as to what happened to her and her fellow Nostromo crew members.  But then contact is lost with LV-426, and despite initially throwing Ripley ""to the wolves"" (as she herself puts in), The Company, through representative Carter J. Burke (Paul Reiser), suddenly finds itself in a position of having to ask Ripley for help, finally persuading her to return to the planet that still consumes her every nightmare, as an advisor to a motley group of very tough colonial marines expecting this to be just another run-of-the-mill ""bug-hunt"".  But how wrong that assumption turns out to be!I would argue that ALIENS far surpasses its celebrated predecessor in almost every aspect.  Obviously the sheer spectacle of what is basically a Vietnam war movie in space is particularly awe-inspiring - the impressive sets, the many excitingly-staged combat sequences, the aliens themselves (interestingly enough, although through fast cutting and appropriate camera placement it seems as though there are hundreds of aliens being blasted to kingdom come - or else picking off the gung-ho marines one by one - in reality no more than 6 aliens are ever seen in any one shot).  But the human drama element of this sequel is also greatly heightened, primarily by the introduction of ""Newt"" (wonderful little Carrie Henn, in her only film role), who turns out to be the sole survivor of recent events on LV-426, becoming a kind-of surrogate daughter to Ripley, which leads to several touching moments and gives the story a surprisingly effective emotional core in the midst of all the otherwise pre-eminent carnage.Amongst the talented supporting players are Cameron regulars Michael Biehn (THE TERMINATOR, THE ABYSS) and Bill Paxton (bit part in THE TERMINATOR, TRUE LIES, TITANIC), and Cameron's punchy dialogue includes such suitably macho wisecracks as - Hudson (Paxton): ""Hey Vasquez, have you ever been mistaken for a man?""  Vasquez (a pumped-up Jenette Goldstein): ""No, have you?""  Nominated for 7 Oscars, including Weaver as Best Actress (again this confirms the general class on display, as it is fairly rare for the Academy to recognize the acting qualities inherent in this type of predominantly action-driven movie), the film went on to win for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound Effects Editing.  Further, almost inevitable sequels followed in 1992 and 1997, but I prefer to think of the terrifying perils of Ellen Ripley as ending on this high note.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Less terror, more action","After 7 years, ""Alien"" is back, this time brought by another great director, James Cameron, shifting the focus of the movie a little, bringing it from terror to action, but still without losing its origin completely. With an apathetic script, where we have a situation to bring the legendary lieutenant Ripley back to action, even though not being extremely creative, the script never gives in to ridicule, on the contrary, it takes itself seriously and we take it too seriously. 57 years after the events of ""Alien"", Ripley returns to the planet LV- 426 to help families who explore the place, this time accompanied by a troop of soldiers, the ""Aliens"" end up being underestimated ... With less terror and more Action, the script still pleases. Technically the film is exquisite, having the face of the 80's, but better done, packed with visual effects that appeal to this day, James Cameron does well. Lastly, ""Aliens"" is a good continuation and a natural evolution of Plot, characters and context, but will never have the charm and impact of its predecessor.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Exciting Continuation,"Review 2 of 4As the middle part of the Alien trilogy this film accomplishes exactly what any good second chapter must do, it builds on the world established in the first film and takes the story in new and interesting places. The emotional canvas of this story is broader than the original Alien, and the film as a whole is less subtle. I really like the theme's of family and the parallel character arcs of Ripley and Newt. They are both characters who have lost everything they ever cared about and through finding each other they attempt to fill the holes in their hearts that their respective losses have left behind. Cameron takes great time in setting up his characters from the start, something that was lacking in the original. The beginning of the film may be a little slow but like Cameron's next film, The Abyss, the payoff in the end would not be nearly as satisfying without all this time to get to know the characters and become emotionally invested. The setup is massively important to the rest of the film. Aside from the abundance of action this film benefits greatly from a larger emphasis on character. Hudson, Hicks, Vasquez, Burke, and Bishop are all very memorable characters, perhaps more memorable than those in the original film. It is the relationships between these characters that make it more than just an action film. Cameron has such a way with dialog and Aliens is a prime example. I have built entire friendships on mutual love of this movie. So many lines are so easily quotable. From a technical level this film is flawless, and like the original it has not aged much at all since its release twenty years ago.If in the first film Ripley was discovering her inner strength, Aliens is where she learns to master her fear. In this film we also learn the depths of her humanity that was scarcely present in the original film (the scene where she goes back to save her cat comes to mind.) Ripley is a character that continues to change and grow, and this film does a fine job of fleshing out her interesting (in under developed) character from the first film. Aliens is definitely a film to watch more than a few times, but for different reasons than the first. The mystery and ambiance of the original film makes it fascinating to watch multiple times, but Aliens is more like spending time with old friends, you want to spend two and a half hours with these characters. Aliens is quite possibly the perfect sequel because it gives you everything you got in the first film and much, much more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Overrated,"Every time I watch this I can't escape the feeling that it reduces the brilliant, atmospheric original to an average action movie.What I find annoying about ""Aliens"" is the forced characterizations of the cliche space marines. Each one of them is an archetype whereas the crew members of the original movie were so realistic and memorable, I can recall each of their names and I feel like I know their individual personalities. I can only recall one of the marine's names, which would be Michael Biehn's character -- who was totally wasted -- and could have been played by anyone.Most annoying of all is the movie's overt attempt to portray its female characters as badass and capable. The most obnoxious example is the butch hispanic one who looks and acts ridiculous. Most embarrassing of all is the red-headed guy who serves as her hype man, literally giving her a high-five when she makes cocky remarks so the viewer knows they're supposed to like her and be impressed. When she is introduced, her ginger hype man literally says ""you're just too bad"". You know writing is weak when a movie has to tell you its characters are cool. In the original, we were sold on Ripley as she proved her competence in survival whereas here it feels like pandering.From my perspective, it seems that ""Aliens"" has been overhyped by the action movie fan. If that is your genre of choice, I can appreciate why you enjoy it, but I draw the line when I start hearing claims that this is superior or even equal to the original. I suspect that many of those who make such claims are the types who did not have the patience or appreciation for the slow burn of the original. It's kind of ridiculous to think that a movie like ""Alien"" needed an upgrade to begin with. Maybe in some people's minds, the thought of multiplying the number of xenomorphs elevates the material, but in my opinion all this does is diminish the scariness, which cheapens the whole subject.James Cameron essentially rebooted ""Alien"" with more xenomorphs and armed characters to allow for more action (that falls flat.) He swapped the Nostromo for the colonist base which pales in comparison. I found the colonist base to be uninteresting as a setting, unlike the Nostromo which felt claustrophobic, moody and more visually interesting with its memorable technologal aesthetic. ""Aliens"" is visually boring in comparison. The special effects are mostly good but somehow aged worse than the original's. The movie mostly consists of these characters lumbering down corridors wearing unconvincing costumes and spouting one-liners.Narratively, there really is not much to say. The planet from the first movie has been colonized but the downed alien spacecraft was never found even though it was established in the original that Weyland-Yutani knew about it. One family stumbles upon it and shortly thereafter the whole base goes dark. A team of marines is sent in and Ripley joins them as an advisor under the pretense the xenomorph will be exterminated, which she stupidly believes despite finding out for herself in the first movie there was a secret agenda to recover one. The ho-hum story is the same conventional narrative about shady coporations we have seen countless times that only serves to set up action set pieces.I feel that sequels to ""Alien"" suffer from the same problem as all the sequels to ""Jurassic Park"" because they don't really continue a thread or answer questions, they're just episodic excuses to place this character into a new creature-feature. My rating is not an attempt to bring the average down to be contrarian -- as a fan of ""Alien"" I just never got much out of watching this.I'd like to think that if Ridley Scott had a burning desire to do a sequel, he would have the story in a setting distinct from the first, such as Earth because there is great interest in what that looks like. (An ""Alien"" movie in a ""Blade Runner"" type setting would have been amazing.) ""Alien 3"" had the respectable ambition to return to just one xenomorph but the result was a dull and uninspired remake of the first movie that was much worse than this. The ""get in, get out"" story of ""Aliens"" brings ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" to mind so I don't get all the love for this movie. It is a technical achievement but far from a masterpiece in any other regard. People use that term too loosely. I'll take ""Prometheus"" over this or any of the other sequels any day.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Triumph of Sci-Fi Action,"James Cameron's ""Aliens"" is a rare sequel that not only matches but in many ways surpasses its predecessor. The 1986 film took the suspenseful, atmospheric horror of Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" and transformed it into a high-octane, sci-fi action thriller without losing the essence of what made the original so compelling.""Aliens"" returns Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley, the sole survivor of the Nostromo, now waking from hyper-sleep to a world that has moved on without her. When contact is lost with a colony on the same planet where the Nostromo encountered the alien, Ripley, still haunted by her previous experience, reluctantly agrees to join a marine expedition as an advisor. This setup shifts the tone from the claustrophobic, singular horror of ""Alien"" to a grander scale, combining elements of military action, horror, and science fiction in a seamless blend.Cameron's direction is meticulous and intense. He expands the alien universe with broader lore and deeper themes, including corporate greed and the maternal instincts of both Ripley and the alien queen, leading to a climactic showdown. The action sequences are groundbreaking, including the iconic Power Loader suit battle, which remains one of the most memorable moments in sci-fi cinema.Weaver's performance is the backbone of the film. Her portrayal of Ripley as a tough, resourceful, yet deeply human character set a new standard for female action heroes. The supporting cast, notably Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton, add depth and humanity to the marines, avoiding one-dimensional characterizations.The visual effects and creature design in ""Aliens"" are exemplary. The use of practical effects for the aliens and the environments they inhabit creates a tangible, immersive world. The film's pacing is another feat; Cameron expertly builds tension and fear, interspersing quieter, character-driven moments with intense action sequences.The thematic depth of ""Aliens"" is noteworthy. It explores the idea of facing one's fears, corporate exploitation, and the concept of motherhood in a way that is rare for action movies. This thematic richness, combined with masterful direction, strong performances, and innovative effects, makes ""Aliens"" a landmark film.In summary, ""Aliens"" is more than just a sequel; it's a reimagining that expands and enriches its source material. It's a film that successfully blends multiple genres to create a thrilling, emotionally resonant, and visually spectacular cinematic experience. It's not just a great sci-fi action film; it's one of the greatest films of the 20th century.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Bigger is not necessarily better,"I'm actually surprised of the rating on this movie. I've just recently saw the original Alien, I didn't have big expectations I've never been a big fan of neither science fiction or monsters horror but ten minutes in and I was already hook. The first thing that captured my attention was the cinematography, there isn't one bad shot on that film, it looks beautiful. The sets design and overall world building is great. Even without knowing anything about that world you feel like you're part of it and it absolutely feels like it's happening in out space. This one on the other hand, could be anywhere, it's more of a military base than anything else. It lacks identity. One of my favorite scenes of the original is when they talk to Mother and how they have to face the reality of being a small and insignificant part of something greater, something that they can't even begin to understand. Those themes are not even present on this sequel. A bunch of unlikable characters with terrible dialogues, a lot of guns, explosions, futuristic cars and fire. It's an action movie, nor horror or suspense. There isn't any tension. I guess if something can be redeemable is Ripley, who remains a compelling character and hers and Newt relationship, besides that the story is just weak. Ironically the reasons of why I didn't enjoy this movie are probably the ones why people like it so much. There's was definitely a time in cinema were *the bigger the better*",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What a classic!,"I only watched this film recently, and it's really weathered the test of time brilliantly. Was on the edge of my seat biting my nails, the tension was electric, the aliens are scary (the practical effects are great! Better than some CGI I've seen recently). Last but certainly not least, Sigourney Weaver is fantastic. I wish I'd watched this sooner.Ripley is a true masterclass in a good female character: capable, caring, tough as nails, and smart as hell.(Minor aside: I particularly loved Ripley's practical shoes and hair, a gripe I have watching action movies is the female action hero with loose flowing locks wearing sky-high heels while in close combat. It's ridiculous. Somehow it keeps happening, even in 2022!)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Game over, man! Game over!""","My favorite movie of all time. It's one of those rare movies that is completely perfect in almost every aspect you can think of. The setting, the characters, the dialogue, the visual design, the writing, the storytelling, the pacing, and the acting. Oh my gosh, this movie is really one of the greatest movies ever made. It might probably be the best sequel of all time. It perfectly follows the story without changing or ignoring the stuff that happened in the original movie. It also has nothing but practical effects and miniatures in the action sequences and sets that makes this blow most of the CGI-filled 'movies' out of the water. And guess what, it has a strong female lead character. But the reason why this works is because there was no woke identity politics or forced diversity to pander to the soy filled SJW leftists on social media and Twitter because this wasn't even a thing in 1986. What mattered was actual good storytelling and writing which is the reason why most movies suck. ""We're on express elevator to hell, goin' down!""

When the ""vehicle""is running around, it's the same music as the battle scenes in ST2TWOK!

Easily the best of all the aliens,"When I first watched Alien i was really impressed and had to get Aliens. I wasn't sure if this could be as good because most sequels hardly ever surpass the first. But I thought this was a lot better. Don't get me wrong the first was brilliant but this was amazing. Everything was right. They had a brilliant cast, brilliant story, brilliant effects and brilliant acting.The thing i was most impressed about was the design of it all. It looked amazing. They Made things look realistic and the aliens looked really good as well. The aliens home was put together brilliantly. For a 1986 film they made the effects look really good and the set. The king alien looked very good and the set of it's home was very good as well. Yet again Sigourney Weaver puts on a brilliant performance as like she did in the first one and Jennette Goldstien as Pvt Vaquez gave a great performance and is one of the best movie heroes ever.With the first film it had a lot of parts that made you jump and had you on the edge of your seat. It was exactly the same with this one. There were lots of parts that made you jump and nearly the whole film had you on the edge of your seat wanting to know what was going to happened next and they had a lot more gore in this than the first which was good to see because i thought in the first it would be fairly gory but it weren't that much.If you thought the first was good you must watch this. You will be blown away by the effects and design and the great action sequences they have with the aliens. It is one of the best films made and it will keep you entertained from start to finish.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of James Cameron's best,Watching Aliens I almost forget this was 1986. The special effects still looked great. As good as Alien. Alien was a little more creepy while Aliens has more action.

Greatest ever movie!!!!!,I've seen hundreds of movies maybe thousands and non have come close to aliens except alien and even that is not as excellent as this.

Game Over!,"When it comes to sequels that are just as good as the first, the gold standard is The Godfather: Part II. But Aliens, I think, should be looked at in the same regard. It's one of the rare sequels that keeps what made the first film great and only expands upon it, while also switching franchises all together. Alien is a haunted house horror movie. Aliens is a sci-fi action movie helmed by the master of the genre, James Cameron. It's a complete change of tone and you know what? It rocks. Ridley and Co. are badass. The screenplay is also sharper and yes, funnier. Bill Paxton for the win.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Way Better than It Was Supposed To Be, For Sure.","In 1979, a young James Cameron, along with many other moviegoers, film lovers, and science fiction and horror fans were transfixed by a unique and revolutionary film that would come to define the science fiction horror sub-genre: Ridley Scott's Alien. Like many, he would be in awe of just how Ridley Scott and crew managed to make a film that felt so fresh, so reinvigorating, and so original. I know that I, as well as anyone would be terrified in taking this on, but somehow Cameron makes a film that has the same feel of Alien, but also distinguishes itself from Alien at the same time.A sequel to one of the greatest science fiction horror films of all time sounded odd to most people, with Cameron himself later admitting that even he initially didn't want to see a sequel for Alien, or to make one for that matter. Yet somehow, inexplicably, Cameron would go on to make what many people consider to be a film that's as good, if not even better than the original (which I contest, but I'll get to that as I go along).Aliens is a slightly different beast from the original film, Ebert would go on to call Aliens a roller coaster ride of intensity, rather than its more quieter, subtler predecessor. I wouldn't be surprised if Cameron took a note from John Carpenter in how to combine theatrical intensity and genuine suspense. Much like with the original Alien, Cameron never allows you an out when dealing with these creatures, either you're all in or you're completely out. But it's not afraid to be fun either, it's certainly a film that knows what it is, and it has no fear in being fun and awesome while also being suspenseful and tense. It's a feat that few directors can pull off, and Cameron manages to do so with finesse for the most part.On the other hand, I was quite surprised by the sensitivity and intelligence that this film was sometimes able to demonstrate, particularly with its characters. Not unlike Alien, much of the best conflicts that are in this film comes from the characters, their personalities and motivations, and the film is careful not to over indulge in the action to the point where one may get annoyed and demand to get to the aliens already, not unlike Alien, it allows you to invest in these characters and their lives, makes you cheer for them and fear for them and hope that they all get out alright, it is this that I think sets Aliens above other action films of its type.Weaver is excellent in this film, and is clearly the strongest part of it. Much like with Alien, she brings a level headedness to the role, she's the only one who's willing to act against all other circumstances, she's smart, can think on her feet, she's the only one who can be calm and think clearly in a high pressure situation. Much like with the first Alien movie, her change from a completely traumatized wreck of a woman into a hard boiled badass, but also isn't afraid to show a sensitive side to herself, such as with her connection to Newt. The rest of the cast are also stellar, with some of them going on to become noted character actors like Bill Paxton, Lance Henriksen, and Michael Biehn.But is it better than the original film, as some say? Some say yes, but I give a firm no. While it can't be denied that Aliens is well written, directed, and acted, with great action and suspense, I found that the film was missing the psychology and subtlety that made the original Alien such an engrossing and lasting feature. It made the Xenomorph less of a frightening, unstoppable force, more than another movie monster to shoot and kill. Certainly, it was still menacing and threatening, but it wasn't quite as suspenseful, not quite as disturbing, it was more cliched and predictable, more Hollywood to put it frankly. I would expect Cameron, who has a notorious reputation for being a stingey perfectionist to understand this, but I was disappointed that he didn't seem to fully comprehend it.But Britton, one may say, there's the quiet moments of suspense in the film, surely you can't ignore those moments. There were, there's no denying it, I felt like it was having too much fun with itself, too in love with the spectacle of the action and theatrics, rather than any lingering suspense or tension. As previously said, I found that Aliens had slightly missed the quiet intensity and subtle psychological horror that made the first film so endlessly engrossing and fascinating, and it's something that I continually struggle to forgive.Despite its flaws however, Aliens proves to be a worthy successor to the original, even if there were aspects of it that I find were lacking. It is certainly better written, directed, and acted than many of its contemporaries, and even more so than many films of its type today. If you asked me which order you should see the Alien films, I'd recommend the first one and this one, and then leave out all the rest.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Less consequence means less tension,Not a bad movie but the abundance of aliens and how easy to kill they seem in this film takes away a lot of the tension that the first movie so brilliantly built up.

aliens,"Director/Script: James Cameron, Cast: Sigourney Weaver, Carrie Henn, Paul Riser, Lance Henriksen, Michael BiehnPicking up right where the previous film left of, Ripley is wakened out of hypersleep by a salvage crew 57 years after the ship left the alien planet. She is brought back to the 'company' where she tells the story of what happened to the the rest of the crew. However, they don't believe her because the planet is now colonized with about 60 families living on it with no altercations. Evuantally, they loose contact with the colony so they want to send a group of marines to investigate and they want Ripley to go along as an adviser due to her knowledge of the planet. After they arrive on the planet, they discover that the whole colony has been massacred shy of a little boy and girl. The marines become victim.These alien films are rather interesting to review because they are all so different and fans of the series have such passionate differences of opinion as to what their favorite one is, most people favoring the first two. Aliens may be second only to the Star Wars films in the loyal following it gets from its fans. Aliens is unique amongst sequels in that it is actually favored by many fans. No doubt about it, this is a very effective film. It's got good special effects, cinematography, and action sequences. This plays much more like an action film than the previous. James Cameron did not want to duplicate Ridly Scott's film so he took a whole different direction. He had earlier made the Terminator with Arnold Schwarzenegger which was also an action sci-fi. Scott's first Alien film was a much darker film with more elements of horror.I am going to go against many fans (thank God IMDb doesn't list reviewers addressees!) but I was disappointed somewhat with this film. It's not a bad film by any means but I just don't think they were able to capture the same level of mystery or horror in this film which is also why I actually preferred the third one to this. I also felt this film to be to talky especially at the beginning. The marines where an overzealous, arrogant bunch much like the characters in Armagaden (although not that bad!). The crew in the first film were much more subdued in fact I'm not so sure they even liked each other! Anyhow, this is a good film overall but I am more of a fan of the first film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Classic action thriller,"Starting with an excellent scare twist this film picks up years after Ripley's first encounter with the alien. It transpires that the planet where the first alien was discovered has been populated by a science colony. Ripley is sent with a military unit to discover why the colony has lost contact with earth.Cameron really took a risk here in following up one of the most famous sci-fi's ever.  However he takes Scott's vision and expands it to bring in more terror and more plot.  This situation sees more aliens, more action and introduces the sub-plot that the Government would surely be keen to capture any creature capable of killing enemies.  It's a terrifying thought in itself - all the more terrifying because it is very likely to be true!In terms of the action scenes the film tries to stay close to the atmosphere of the original and the terror of the aliens.  In this it succeeds, opening up what we know about the creatures and keeping the scenes darkly lit and moody.  Even though we see more of the creatures the shadows still keep the feeling of the unknown.Weaver is good and is surrounded by several well known character actors (Biehn, Paxton, Henriksen, Reiser) but there is little room for character development.  The fact that Ripley has slept while everyone she knows has died is not really investigated that much.  However this is a minor complaint about a classic action movie.It was never going to be easy to follow the original but Cameron does a good job.  However where the original movie was a sci-fi horror movie this is a main stream sci-fi action movie with guns and explosions taking away from the horror.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Don't understand the high marks,I recently watched all the alien movies. This is by far the worst one. It has no terror or suspense. It is an action flick. And. Not a good one. It is just one shootout after another with no emotion. You're not invested in the characters. Except Ripley. It just is not that good. It is boring at times. The best sequence is the beginning as someone else mention here. By contrast. Romulus takes us back to the old horror feel that made the first one such an amazing experience. This movie is more along the lines of AVP. It's okay. Not good. The writing is horrible. The dialogue forgettable.

That script!,"Saw this as a kid and enjoyed it for the action and the gung ho marines. As an adult I realised how insanely well written this action movie is. Every character brings something to the table and have their moments in the movie which means I care for them, some I root for, some I hope end up on the Alien menu(looking at you Burke).But I'm involved in their fate and journey through the movie. The Ripley character goes from reluctant to involved to taking charge, all done without being obnoxious or condescending. Talk about strong female character. Yes ma'am. It's all done without relegating the male characters (Hicks, Hudson, Bishop, etc) which in turn only elevates Ripley's awesomness. In short, a great well written script makes this a classic 80's action movie and rewatchable.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

It's difficult to forget what you've seen, but it's important to approach this film first if possible rather than joining the series late.It's amazing that this is over 20 years old - apart from the actors looking so young, the film doesn't feel dated at all. The sci-fi visions here are still bleak and futuristic as they were then - this is not the Star Trek vision of the future.

Builds upon the original while maintaining the core fear.,"57 years after surviving the alien on board the Nostromo, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is found on board her shuttle and returned to Earth, but 57 years have passed. Ripley is debriefed by the Weyland-Yutani Corporation who dispute her claims of an alien creature as well as the Ash synthetic who was allegedly operating under orders to secure the alien lifeform at the expense of the crew and Ripley is effectively sidelined in her career as she's the only one left to blame for the loss of the Nostromo. In the years since the incident, the moon where the alien came from, LV-426, has since become a terraforming colony with a population of about 70 families. When contact is lost with LV-426, Ripley is approached by company representative Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) to serve as a consultant on a rescue mission along side a team of Colonial Marines. As Ripley reluctantly agrees to join them, they soon find that the alien threat is even greater this time around.After the success of Alien, Brandywine Productions had been keen on doing a sequel as was 20th Century Fox head Alan Ladd Jr. Before Ladd left the studio to form his own company. With the change in management Fox became heisitant on a sequel and further delayed matters by using Hollywood accounting to claim that Alien had actually been a loss for the studio despite being one of the highest grossing films of the year. This resulted in Fox and Brandywine suing each other with the two eventually settling out of court when Fox agreed to greenlight the sequel. Legendary producer Lawrence Gordon was hugely instrumental in getting James Cameron's treatment and direction for the Alien sequel after the sleeper success of The Terminator, and Cameron himself was also instrumental in keeping Sigourney Weaver for the film as Fox were worried about a salary increase but Cameron stood fast and was helped by Lawrence Gordon. After years of stonewalling by Fox and attempts by them at undermining Brandywine and James Cameron, the movie was released to critical acclaim especially for Weaver's performance and even greater box office than the first film. Aliens stands as a testament to the possibilities of sequels and how they can build upon what was great in the original while still allowing themselves to take risks.While the first Alien was all about being Isolated and vulnerable with no hope of rescue from the outside, Aliens is about the isolation of war as Ripley and our team of marines find themselves surrounded by a faceless enemy seemingly with no end to their attackers as what at first seems like a rescue mission turns into a fight just to survive. The LV-426 moon is put to solid use in its ghost town type appearance where something horrible has happened, and the mixture of inorganic alien resin mixed with the gold grey steel of the colony's corridors makes for unsettling atmosphere in this labyrinth our heroes must survive. The effects this time are by Stan Winston who takes the original H. R. Giger design and builds upon it with his team of technicians to create some truly great sights.Much like the original film, Aliens gives us a solid ensemble. Sigourney Weaver was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance as Ripley and deservedly so as she portrays a broken person out of time and out of place driven to stop the aliens from doing to anyone else what was done to her. In the extended director's cut the performance is made even more powerful with added scenes detailing Ripley's loss of her daughter Amanda to old age which only adds to the emotional weight of the performance, and had the director's cut been released in theaters I have no doubt Weaver would've won that award for her performance because of how heart wrenching it is. Carrie Henn is also quite good as a little girl the marines find on the planet who's managed to survive for weeks by scavenging food and avoiding the aliens, and the relationship between her and Ripley while already good is also improved by the director's cut. The team of marines is filled with solid actors like Cameron's staples Michael Biehn, Lance Henriksen, Bill Paxton, and many others, but Paul Reiser is great as the company representative Carter Burke who serves as a secondary antagonist and is perfect in the role as his smooth talking negotiator surface conceals a darker more exploitative core.Aliens does what a good sequel should do: up the ante while maintaining the original core. From Weaver's great performance, James Cameron's intense direction, and a solid ensemble the movie delivers everywhere it should. The action sequences are intense and the atmosphere is so thick you can cut it with a knife. Much like the original Alien, Aliens has also served as a benchmark in the genre with scores of imitators trying to copy the formula.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
80s gungho pap,"I remember when I first saw the original I thought it was the scariest film I had ever seen.

What I got was Rambo in space with all the levels of forethought, scriptwriting skills and character development that made films like Commando and the Rambos etc. what they were - very bad movies. The makers of Aliens missed the point of the original completely - the original alien was scary because they couldn't kill it, the characters were imperfect and real and had real fears - in this gungho rubbish the aliens get splattered all over the place and the characters seemed only scared that the director might not get their best angle.

"The ""perfect organism"" en masse in the perfect movie","""Aliens"" is, without question, the greatest science fiction action/adventure movie of all time.  This is a spellbinding, jaw-dropping epic of a movie masterpiece that pulls off the rarest of feats -- it actually tops its predecessor, the inimitable ""Alien"", even going so far as to make it look the slightest bit campy and predictable by comparison (though it still remains a groundbreaking, chilling, landmark science fiction/horror classic).""Aliens"" interweaves competing themes and juxtaposes action, character development, suspense, cameraderie, fear and heroism brilliantly.  The movie is far more multi-faceted than the original, which surpassed it on the horror and suspense fronts only.  ""Aliens"" adds doses of realism to make the entire viewing experience seem more ""human"" -- the Hudson whining at times seems ad-libbed, the dialogue is unmatched in a movie of its genre and the heroism is, remarkably,  under-glorified.  The characters make mistakes throughout the movie, a deft touch by Cameron and counter to the typical Hollywood action hero ""kick ass"" mentality.Every single character in ""Aliens"" is likeable at one time or another, even the villain Burke.  Think of all the great ensemble casts you've seen in the past, whether they be on television (""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"", ""Cheers"") or on the silver screen (""Fried Green Tomatoes"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"", etc.).  Psychologically, this is an important method to convey and establish a connection between the viewer and the movie.  Conversely, movies that fail to develop that connection sufficiently tend to suffer as a result. ""Aliens"" far and away does the best job of this in the entire series, well ahead of the original and light-years ahead of the successors.Speaking of which, the third installment was flawed, choppy and illogically constructed but nonetheless a worthy effort and the fourth a debacle in both form and function.  My suggestion is that the viewer pop in the original, view and enjoy its atmosphere and cat-and-mouse terror, then immediately view the roiling, adrenaline-inducing, light-speed second installment.  You will walk away from that session marvelling at how this franchise was born and raised.

Aliens vs Guns !!!,"'Aliens' is the 2nd film in the Alien film franchise and probably the most popular film in the aforementioned franchise.

On Earth, no one believes her story about the events on the planet LV-426 which she experienced and she loses her licence. The Weyland-Yutani Corporation had already ordered the colonisation of LV-426 during Ripley's extended absence. But suddenly all communication with the colony gets lost and the company decides to send a team of tough, rugged, space marines to investigate the situation along with Ripley to help them with her knowledge.James Cameron did something exceedingly brave when he decided to practically change the genre in the sequel to an immensely popular original film. While Ridley Scott's 'Alien' was sci-fi horror with elements of tension and claustrophobia, Cameron's 'Aliens' even though it still retains some of the slow tension building in the 1st half, is basically a straight up action blockbuster which makes it much more accessible to the general masses. It has the 80s written all over it. This film raises the stakes and makes everything bigger and louder than 'Alien'. There are explosions, there are machine guns, and this time instead of one, Ripley along with the other marines faces a whole army of Xenomorphs. The film again looks beautiful and the visuals hold up on Blu Ray. Cameron's craft as a director can't be doubted after watching this. Cameron holds the tension in the first half and then bombards the viewer with one brutal action set-piece after another in the second half.When it comes to the themes, Cameron actually retains the theme of the ill-effects of capitalism that was a part of 'Alien'. But although this capitalism angle does appear in 'Alien', Ridley Scott was a little more subtle, while I felt Cameron went a bit overboard to drive home the evil corporation element in the storyline and at times it became slightly unrealistic. Another element is of course feminism. Ripley, I believe becomes the true action hero in this film more than in 'Alien'. She overcomes all the naysayers above her in the hierarchy and truly owns her power and evolves into a truly powerful woman. We also clearly see strong themes of motherhood running throughout the film which again is handled in a slightly overt way. But there also hints at racism in the script and this racism theme I think is what Cameron handles the best with the requisite amount of nuance.Unfortunately, this film didn't have the lingering effect that 'Alien' had in my mind. I preferred 'Alien's subtlety over the big and blockbuster feel of this film. The grand scale of the action sequences in this film genuinely makes 'Alien' look like an indie horror film. But I thought the endless action sequences although very well directed in the end to some extent diluted the overall effect and at times went into ridiculous territory. The film also has a number of endings like 'Return of the King'. There are also certain relationships that are forged in the course of the narrative that made me correctly predict who is going to live in the end and who won't.Sigourney Weaver is absolutely brilliant in this film. She richly deserved the Oscar nomination. She conveys every emotion possible in the film be it frustration, love, anger or fear. She also completely commits to the role and becomes a compelling action hero. Ripley evolves from the role of indefatigable survivor in 'Alien' to the role of the tough, bad-ass mother in this film. Although most of the characters in 'Aliens' lack the realism and are not as believable as the Nostromo crew in 'Alien', but they are entertaining and funny. I'll give a special mention to Bill Paxton, Jenette Goldstein and Michael Biehn.'Aliens' is a film that I can enjoy a lot and watch over and over again. But every time I do, it somehow fails to stick in my mind for too long due to the over-dependence on action sequences. It is a big 80s action film that is one of the best of its genre, but still in my eyes not as deep and satisfying as the original film in the series.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Intense, jaw-dropping, brilliant ""analog"" action flick","Many times replicated, never equaled, Aliens is the best action movie of all time. There is nothing that even comes very close. It's hard to articulate the effect this film has had on me. It's one of those rare cinematic experiences that doesn't spoil with time and so-called ""maturity."" The first time I saw Aliens was at a friend's house. I was 13 and I was totally blown away. I'm now 31 and Aliens still rocks my world. Where Alien is stark and slinking and great in its own way, the sequel is bombastic and balls-to-the-wall.So many scenes stand out. I'll never forget my initial viewing of the terrifying, kick-ass sequence where the creatures first attack the Space Marines (""They're all around us man!"") However, the brilliance of this film lies in the fact that the ""quiet"" scenes are as powerful as the action-packed ones: The hint of romance as Hicks demonstrates his assault rifle to Ripley; the look of despair on Ripley's face when she's told there are families colonizing the planet.I will always love Weaver for her achingly intense performance here. I've never seen another like it in the genre. The supporting cast is wonderful, as well. Standouts include Biehn (also awesome in Terminator), Henricksen, Reiser and of course Bill Paxton, who practically steals the show.You look at sci-fi/action flicks today, and most of em are soulless exercises in CGI. Cameron's models and costumed monsters are much more effective than anything George Lucas tried in the Star Wars prequels.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing sequel,"All the suspense of Alien is lost. The almost invincible intelligent predator has been diminished to a mindless beast, slaughtered in masses by Ripley, a corporate jerk and a bunch of military dimwits. The only character with any depth is the little girl Newt, who's lines are the only thing remembered from this movie, and the little first time actress Carrie Henn does a wonderful job with the role. The android character Bishop is also somewhat sympathetic, redeeming the reputation after John Hurt's memorable Kane in Alien.

This movie is the zenith of sci-fi,"Aliens is the best movie ever made for sci-fi action.  For the most part it is the best movie of all time.

If you haven't seen Aliens then you're missing out.The movie doesn't lean too heavily on one or the other.  For those who don't like sci-fi you can enjoy the action or visa-versa.  Those who don't like either can enjoy the story.  Or if you're like me you can enjoy them all. Nothing tops this movie.  People often say they are making the Alien-killer or whatever.

A sequel that moved me!,"Well, Alien is without a Science fiction/horror classic, but the 1986 sequel is the kind of film that in some ways surpasses the original, and can also do the series justice (corny I know) and pretty much becomes one of the most original, special effects gold, acted greatly (Weaver can't get much better than this), and exciting to watch sequels of all time! The music is some of the best i've herd of Goldsmith, if he composed, the way it sounds like something by todays standers and can really grab you're attention.The character development is better than I expected, seeing as you come to know these Marines and relate to us (much like in The Thing, one of my favorites.)The special effects are so good, most people say ""this move is way ahead of it's time!"" My response is, Agreed.The plot is at first view (for people we aren't SciFci nerds, I'm one) hard to understand, unless you watch this movie many times, What I did with the Thing.The quotes are really memorable; such as ""GAME OVER MAN! GAME OVVVERRR!!!"" or ""Get away from her, YOU BITCH!!! I love the dialogue, it's just plain good.Overall, watch this film if you enjoyed T2: Judgement day, The Thing, Alien, or Invasion of The Body Snatchers, or just want to have a thrilling, epic, long (I have the uncut version), cool, outstanding, groundbreaking, or just plain great this October, then you need to see ""Aliens""",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
They mostly come at Night...Mostly,"When Alien first hit the Screen, it helped usher in an era of Sci-fi in its visual world-building and atmospheric appeal with round characters that were found but still had an element to it that was more than campy costumes and shooting lasers. Both Ridley Scott's and H. R. Giger's minds, combine to create this very other world feel to it. When James Cameron was brought on board to direct Aliens with the effort of past designers of the original, he managed to Honor the Substance and ominous tone of the Original while also expanding on the world. Alien was very much a Horror film in Space. A monster picking off Victims by one had a very ominous feel to it Whether there was noise, or it was complete silence. There was this feeling of isolation and low-level tension. This very much shows in the first half of the film When they are at the colony you still have the barren feel. You have these untrained everyday people against a single monster. How do you up that with a prepared Group? Enter the Colonial Marines one of the most Iconic Groups in Sci-fi History. Whether it's Bill Paxton as Hutson or Hicks or Vasquez. The chemistry between all of them is proud, Confident, Arrogant. The amount of charm and hubris Each of these characters delivers leaves a long-standing impact. Like most military, they believe they have complete control. And when you enter the base and see the hive it draws you in and then drops into the Action that this film delivers on a much larger heart pounding., but the movie still delivers on that human element one of the most important cores of the film is Ripley. Sigourney Weaver already made an impact with the original. The sequel cemented Her and the character of Ripley as Action Icon. She's just very rounded. She didn't just return to be there. The ordeal of She has been drifting in Space for 57 years and had a daughter who died and never married or had kids. The hearing You set her up as she lost having to find a purpose. When she meets Newt, she almost finds herself again being this guardian and mother to this little girl who lost everything herself.

How a follow up movie should be done !!,"Aliens highlights and perfectly illustrates the arrogance of man's (and especially the American) attitude and supposition of superiority over all things. It also highlights the despicable lengths that corporations will stoop too to generate money. Maybe thats a cynical view but none the less it is true.The movie itself is fabulous. Gone is the rackety bucket of the Nostromo and in its place is the next evolutionary step what is expected 50 plus years later. However the technology is not overbearing and is entirely plausible for soldiers. The ships look fantastic, the weapons are awesome and I am still waiting for the 'Loader' as a Christmas present.The cast is excellent. Ever since Terminator, I have been a massive Michael Biehn fan and he didn't fail to deliver. Bill Paxton's Hudson is an instant classic and he is responsible for some of the most truly memorable lines in the movie. The human villain in Aliens plays his role so well, I was actually guilty of not liking the actor for years because I couldn't overcome his absolute credible portrayal of a man consumed with loyalty to his corporations avarice.Of all the Alien franchise movies, Sigourney Weaver puts in her best performance. You feel her xenophobia and believe the outright terror she feels. The solo preparation of her ride down the elevator is some of the best acting I have ever witnessed. The interaction between characters is surprisingly in-depth and varied to say Aliens is primarily a sci-fi action movie; true camaraderie, distrust, blossom of love, deep respect, intense dislike and more are examined in and unfolded in a totally believable and well executed manner. I also loved the mix of male and female in equal risk taking/responsibility roles and I love the fact the 'true' equality is not rammed down the audience's throat.We get to see more of the 'alien' in this outing but realistically it's more quick edited shots. However the mother of all aliens makes her appearance and she is phenomenal. If you haven't seen Aliens, the first time you see her, you will be awestruck.The major difference between Alien and Aliens is the way the horror and thrill is extracted from the audience. Alien is very claustrophobic in its suspense and setting and is so successful. Aliens on the other hand has some elements of that claustrophobia, however the pace is higher and the audience is swept along with multiple jumps, startles, and action scenes all to a brilliant and most befitting musical score.Aliens is a must see cult classic, and like all the movies in the Alien saga, the Director's cut is the version that is essential to view. A large majority of Alien saga fans rate this movie the best, it is certainly close.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Almost an Army feature Film,"When I saw ""Aliens"" more than 20 years ago, I didn't like it because of the military presence. I didn't like the Army, and I didn't believe that in the future such an armed rabble would be used to make something like 'first contact' with possibly precious xenomorphs. I disliked the complete crew, and my understanding was that the movie was sympathizing with them. Maybe I was wrong and it is all humor, and the Army is satirized. I'm not that intelligent, you should know.At first, I liked the introduction. Ripley aged only a few years during her 57 years hibernation, I found that time line a good Idea. Unfortunately, script writer's imagination could not transport the effects of this half century, on the contrary, technology, clothing and behavior mention more a regression than improvement.First laugh (in a bad sense) was, when Ripley was accused for destroying her worthy freighter Nostromo. Of course was the Nostromo worthy like a supertanker, but isn't a ship of this size and the cargo insured ? They had 57 years to get the insurance sum, so what's up with this future ?Later it comes out that the contact to the colony on the Alien egg planet is lost. Surely they had no opportunity to report what happened. A colony around an expensive atmospheric modifier doesn't give any reports about what's happening or any dangerous incidents.Someone in the movie says that it lasts decades to transform a planets atmosphere. Meanwhile the colonists, which are obviously researching the surface, didn't find any trace from the huge stranded spaceship, which sent the distress call that led the Nostromo to her final destruction in the first movie. OK, colonists are dumb or simply blind.Also dumb are the marines. Confrontated with Ripley who is the last survivor of a deadly alien encounter, they are not willing to hear anything what she says. I as their officer would have made them shut up immediately, because every information could be important for surviving. If soldiers of the future are such idiots as shown here, there would be no need for powerful aliens to destroy humanity.I can't imagine that any officer wouldn't send artificial drones ahead to research the situation. I can't imagine, too, that anyone would send such a small and dumb team to investigate the possible alien-caused death of 70 families. The mission in the later ""AVP"" movie is much better prepared with scientists from all over the world. OK, here we have Bishop, but he doesn't seem to be very helpful, and he has no rights to make decisions. A few more Bishop's, especially for fighting purposes, would have made the mission more serious.The greatest disappointment in ""Aliens"" is the disappearance of the alien's being nearly indelible. When the alien in the first movie is not even destroyed by the escape pod's jet engines (it's adapting to the heat, i suppose), it is here like destroying cockroaches. You can squish them with your car, you can shoot them, or simple burn with a standard flamethrower. A bunch of well-armed soldiers with a little bit more brain than the people shown in this movie would be able to eliminate a complete alien population. For what purpose would the military use such a weak race defies me. Sure, you can infest a planet of your enemies, you don't have to care about them any more. But then your own world would be also in danger because of the revenge of the survivors. And the infested world is useless. However, I know, military is always interested in new and dangerous toys.The mystery of the aliens and the other race - the big stoned guy - from the first movie is completely gone. It is simply a bug slashing feature film. When they find out that the colonists have already caught two living facehuggers, Burke's mission would be done. Instead, they are going ahead for certain death.There are many errors in the script. One is, how did Burke mange to put the facehugger to Ripley's sleeping place. Did he carry the containment tank, or did he carry the alien under his arm ? Then, there is the first confrontation between the Queen and Ripley. Ripley fills the eggs with loads of ammo and explosives, Mother's bearing channel is slashed, and there is no acid burning Ripley and Newt. And in the final fight, the ladder where Ripley is hanging is always within reach for the queen's second hand. Instead, she is angrily swinging around with her free arm. And I thought (almost), come on, big lady, take the ladder, take it, please, and then eat Ripley for killing your babies. Poor mother, so big, so dumb.The positive side is, that - blinding out the mediocre script, visuals, dialogs and actors - the movie is actually thrilling. It's more thrilling than most of the movie's of it's time, and the idea to fight the queen with the cargo loading exoskeleton is really funny. I personally understood Ripleys decision to go for Newt into the burning reactor, but I also understood that the figure of Newt is only a vehicle to fill plot holes.I gave 5 stars even if it deserves six for the thrill of the hunt.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
...at least it doesn't star Arnold Schwarzenegger,"The sequel to Ridley Scott's repugnant (but memorable) sci-fi monster movie is nothing more than slick, professional, high intensity trash, with Sigourney Weaver reprising her role as the indomitable sole survivor of the earlier expedition. Here she returns to the planet of her nightmares with a company of marines assigned to exterminate the growing colony of voracious aliens, but unlike in the eerie, otherworldly original the emphasis now is strictly on cheap thrills: military firepower vs. insect acid slime. Writer director James Cameron clearly knows how to manipulate his audience: each shock is delivered on cue at a furious and exhausting pace, and every visceral effect (not to mention every line of formula dialogue) has been calculated to guarantee the proper response, whether laughter or revulsion or (says Weaver to alien threatening small child: ""get away from her, you bitch!"") a rousing cheer.

GAME OVER MAN! GAME OVER!,"A white knuckle ride from start to finish. Often given as the example of when sequels out-do the original (although that can be argued).Aliens' 2 1/2 run time never outstays its welcome as James Cameron smashes from one set piece to the next as we follow a rag tag bunch of marines with a reluctant Elen Ripley in toe as they head back to LV-426 from the first film to find out what the hell is going on down there.This film absolutely rocks! It's script is snappy delivering endlessly quotable dialogue, the special effects still look awesome and the imagery designed by Giger still shocks and disgusts to this day. The cast features the standard Cameron recruits including an excellent Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton who arguably steals every scene he is in.Aliens is a film that took its source material and revolutionised it acting as a framework for how movie sequels should be made.

And the less said about the later sequels, the better.I imagine you've already seen Aliens and are just reading this review to see how great other people also think it is, but if not, or if you haven't seen it for a while, then I recommend watching it again soon. It's amazing how good it still is, getting close to being 30yrs old.I had the good fortune to watch it on the big screen last year as part of a Halloween double bill at my local cinema.

The best action film of all time. Period.,"Aliens is one of those films that is perfect on virtually every level and also stands the test of time. The practical xenomorph effects (particularly the final fight with the queen) look better than any released today. Thanks to the flawless direction by Cameron, the action sequences are seamless. The characters and acting are also all top notch. One thing sorely missing from modern day action/monster movies are compelling human characters. Like in Jaws, the human characters in Aliens are even more memorable than the beasts themselves. Ripley, Hicks, Hudson, etc. We will remember these names and their lines for the rest of our lives. Aliens is an action benchmark that has yet to be equaled.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Aliens is a good action film but not as great as Alien,"¨We'd better get back, 'cause it'll be dark soon, and they mostly come at night¨Many people consider Aliens to be better or at least at the same level as its predecessor, Alien, but I found it an inferior film in many ways. In my opinion Alien is a perfect film, while Aliens despite being very entertaining is not nearly as scary and has its flaws. This sequel was directed by James Cameron and his trademarks are all over this film. Ridley Scott had managed to direct a small psychological science fiction horror flick, while Cameron made a much larger film, with many aliens, more characters, and a lot more action. This is more of a blockbuster movie than anything else. I've always been a fan of much quieter films that focus on psychological scares than big budget action movies so that may be one of the reasons why I liked Alien much more than Aliens. There is no doubt about Cameron's ability to direct these big budget movies and he always delivers spectacular visual effects, but story wise his films are sometimes lacking in quality. The characters are many times one dimensional and that is exactly the case in Aliens. The only character I really liked in this film and that has depth is Sigourney Weaver's Ripley. Unlike in Alien where the main character seemed to be the alien despite not showing up much on screen; in Aliens we have plenty of screen time for the aliens, but I never felt like they were a main character. It's as if so much overexposure to them made me care less about the aliens and more about Ripley. So in conclusion Alien was the creature's movie, while Aliens is Weaver's film. She has a very strong role and her presence is what has made this film so successful. She carries the film and in a way makes us forget about the rest of the one dimensional characters. The story continues right where the original left off with Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) in the Nostromo shuttle in hypersleep along with her cat. She is awaken by a salvage team that has found her vessel drifting through space. Burke (Paul Reiser), who works for the same company that the original crew members worked for, informs Ripley that she has been asleep for 57 years. The company briefs Ripley as to what happened with the ship and the rest of the members, and don't believe her story. They say that if her story were true then the colony of over 60 families that has been living on the planet where she claims to have seen the derailed ship would have encountered the aliens by now. The colony has been there for over twenty years without experiencing difficulties, and Ripley is discharged as a space pilot. Some time later, when the company loses contact with the colony, Burke asks Ripley to come along with them as a consultant. The company sends a military team to find out what has happened to the colonists and Ripley is offered to come along with them reinstating her if she does so. This is just an excuse for Cameron to get the crew in the same planet as the aliens and have much more action. Ripley decides to travel with the team which consists of Lt. Gorman (William Hope), the android Bishop (Lance Henriksen), Cpl. Hicks (Michael Biehn), Pvt. Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein), Pvt. Hudson (Bill Paxton), Cpl. Ferro (Colette Hiller), among many other soldiers who are heavily armed and qualified. Once they reach the planet they find no sign of any colonists, except for a ten year old girl named Newt (Carrie Henn) who has managed to survive and tells them that monsters have killed the rest, and that they will come for them as well.This film marked a breakthrough in action films, but isn't really as scary as the original movie. The suspense and psychological horror is replaced with action packed shootouts and explosions. There are many more characters and a lot more aliens so there are a lot of things happening. This is what makes Aliens more entertaining for some people. Cameron had recently come from directing The Terminator so he was already making a name for himself and was able to work with a good budget. He is among the best when it comes to visuals and special effects and many of the visuals in this movie still look great today. Aliens won two Oscars for this reason. I'm not a huge fan of Cameron's work, although I have to admit Terminator 2 is one of the best action movies ever and definitely my favorite James Cameron film. The screenplay was also written by Cameron along with the help of screenwriters David Giler and Walter Hill, and I had small issues with it, although the spectacular action sequences saved it. This is Sigourney Weaver's film and she truly broke out as an A-list actress with this movie. She shines as a true female action hero who's strong and emotional at the same time. Aliens is a good film, just not as perfect as Alien.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Superior Sequel,"One of those rare sequels that is better than the first movie in every way.James Cameron manages to take everything that was great about Ridley Scott's original 1979 film and builds on top of it to make a superior sequel.It not only maintains the claustrophobic atmosphere of the first, but I found the characters more endearing and memorable (Ex. Hicks, Hudson, Vasquez) this time around.The action is great, the creature designs are better, and the visuals are simply awesome. The Queen Alien is one of the greatest monsters ever put on screen and it's amazing that the effects were all done in camera.Aliens also feels more textured from a character and writing perspective. I love the Vietnam War/Starship Trooper aesthetic (I personally like this movie better than the actual Starship Trooper movie) and the underlying themes of motherhood that is further accented in the extended cut.I also liked how Ripley is upgraded to be an action heroine and Cameron showcases this transition perfectly. It all felt perfectly natural and in keeping with the logic of the story (I'M LOOKING AT YOU FORCE AWAKENS!!).James Cameron back in his heyday really understood that in order for all this action and spectacle to matter, you need to have compelling relatable characters to anchor it.It kinda bothers me that there is this growing trend of stereotyping the film as a ""dumber action shoot-em up"" version of Alien, which baffles me to no end.Seriously, it's nearly a full hour before any gun is fired and there is literally zero moments in this story where the marines have the upper hand.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

James Cameron builds an opus from Ridley Scott's masterpiece,"Perhaps the best praise in a review is brevity. This is the single best science fiction film ever made.Cameron is an obsessive genius, with a fixation on detail and obsessive consistency that makes Lucas and Spielberg look like a couple of Troma interns. The ""hard"" special effects, executed by some of the best in the business on carte blanche budgets, are what make the current digital state of the art look fake. The acting is on target and the story is dark, cerebral, inventive, and as utterly believable as it is fantastic. A standard is set here which has never been matched since - this movie makes the Matrix look like a bad Barney episode. I must warn you, seriously, that once you see this, you will be ruined for other science fiction forever.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Watch Alien instead,"Aliens breaks the ""acid blood rule"" to become a movie about shooting at things that move in space. It's exactly like the Ridley Scott movie after removing all character development, pathos, morality, story and weight. But James Cameron does a good job of making it all look pretty. What a fantastically boring populism popcorn flic.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Ridley Scott's Directing Was Missed,"Right off the top the movie made me shake my head with one of those ""it's just too convenient"" moments. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) - the only survivor from the first movie - is finally rescued by a salvage ship after being in ""hyper-sleep"" for 57 years. OK. She tries to brief the company that sent her and her team on the first mission on the dangerous aliens they encountered, but no one will believe her story. Why not? Because there have been human colonists on the planet now for over 20 years and there hasn't been a single report of a problem. Well, we know where this is headed, don't we. Now that Ripley's back all of a sudden contact with the colony is lost, which allows the company to send Ripley back to the planet to do battle with the aliens all over again. Apparently they were waiting for her to be found!Setting aside that moment of ultra-convenience, this movie is weaker than the original in the series. James Cameron took over the directing duties in this from Ridley Scott, and Scott's touch was missed. What made the first movie very effective was the shadowy nature of the aliens. Scott never really gave us a good look at them. They were shadowy figures which made the story quite suspenseful. Cameron dispenses with that idea completely. The aliens are front and centre once the team reaches the planet, and somehow that makes this movie less frightening than its original. Cameron (who also co-wrote the screenplay) also turns this into a pretty standard humans vs. aliens shoot out with lots of weapons and lots of explosions, etc. The characters in this seemed more one dimensional than those in the original. So you have an out of control Marine (Bill Paxton), an in control Marine (William Hope) and the requisite bad guy representing the company (Paul Reiser). Then of course there's Ripley who, while being far more aggressive here than in the original, also gets to explore her maternal side as she becomes a surrogate mother figure to Newt (Carrie Henn) - a little girl who's apparently the only survivor among the colonists. The scene in which Ripley holds the little girl tight as the alien is approaching and says to her ""close your eyes, baby"" is actually a virtual reshoot of a scene in which a mother comforts her daughter as a monster approaches them in a 1957 movie called ""The Monster Who Challenged The World."" And - wow - can Newt ever scream when scary things happen!No. I wasn't especially impressed with this movie, although I did get a laugh near the end, when Ripley appeared to do battle with the aliens inhabiting that big robot-like suit swinging away at the creatures without mercy, and I suddenly realized that - hey - that's where James Cameron got the idea for the same kind of suits the Marines used in ""Avatar!""",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"James Cameron's Powerhouse Sequel to ""Alien""","Say what you will about James Cameron's attempts at more ""serious"" film-making (""Titanic""? Ha!), the man does know how to put together an action movie. He takes a completely different approach to this second film in the ""Alien"" series than Ridley Scott did to the first -- whereas Scott's film was slow, creepy and scarier for what you didn't see than for what you did, Cameron's is nearly non-stop hard-core action. It works though, and for all the difference in their styles, the two films cohere very well together.In this sequel, the focus moves away from the science/research angle of the first and instead focuses on a group of marines sent to a ghost town of a space station to investigate the disappearance of the colonists. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is along for the ride again, and Cameron uses her fear of what they could potentially be walking into effectively. Whereas in the first one, we were scared because we shared the scientists' cluelessness about what was going on and only learned things as they learned them, in this one we're scared in the same way Ripley is, precisely because we know what's going on and how terrifying it is. And Cameron ups the ante here -- instead of one single alien as a nemesis, this group of marines has to deal with hundreds of them.I'm not really a fan of the subplot involving Newt, the little girl the marines find and who forms an attachment to Ripley. But the story does give Ripley's character a lot of motivation and makes her stand off with the aliens much more personal.I've seen this film a few times, so you'd think it wouldn't hold any suspense for me now, but I just watched it again over the weekend and damned if I wasn't on the edge of my seat.Grade: A",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Yeah, baby","The sequel to Ridley Scott's successful ALIEN (1979) is a nonstop, high-tech, souped-up war movie - it does for action sci-fi thrillers what the original did for horror-flicks: namely, reinvent and soup up the genre.This is James Cameron at his very best: wonderfully suspenseful action sequences with our spunky, likable heroes (led by a female - A Cameron staple) taking on a villain that is literally out of this world.Cameron's villains have included relentless terminators and unstoppable icebergs, but the aliens he creates are something else. Killing machines par excellence, vicious and unremorseful.Sigourney Weaver returns as Ellen Ripley in an oscar-nominated performance; Ripley is perhaps the most convincing, exciting action heroine anywhere in filmdom.The rest of the good guys are a squad of hardbitten, foul-mouthed marines, tough and resourceful but fraught with human frailties in a crisis just like any of us.

"An All-Around Fantastic Film, In All Aspects","Great action, great story, but most of all, just a fantastic cast that really knows how to humanize a story. Very much in line with the original, and James Cameron makes sure that he doesn't completely ignore the events of the first film which is so often what sequels with different directors do. There seems to be a lot more action in this one than in the original, which was basically a horror film with some action elements. The characters combat the aliens and in some cases are killed by the aliens in very memorable, distinct ways. The script is sharp as a knife and can bring a tear to your eye at any moment, but also is very funny and keen. Jim Cameron is a great storyteller/director, and when he does both write and direct a movie, you know you're in for a real treat.

a film that will always stand as one of the best action horror films and sequels ever,"After this film it is inexplicable how they didn't award Weaver as best actress with an oscar. What are they waiting for to give her a lifetime achievement award? That she becomes old decrepit? Aliens has all the special effects still practically unbeaten. Cameron's signature is undeniable, to the point that certain aerial scenes are reminiscent of the first Terminator. Everybody were Perfect as actors, but Bill Paxton gives that ironic and scoundrel vein to the general atmosphere and he fits beautifully. Lance Henriksen: another great key-actor to be commended forever. The ending of the film is surreal and physically impossible, in reality ripley's arm would have fractured in a second, but let's leave this sensationalist poetic license to James Cameron who saves himself scoring the maximum ranking with Bishop's quote: ""not bad for a human!""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Testosterone,"I didn't think ""Aliens"" such a very great film really, even though I'm a huge Alien-Sigourney fan. In fact I thought the second of the four to be the weakest : this really was ""America saves the universe, once again"". I know that in space, no one can hear you scream, but you could hardly miss the tough talk of the marines, who, all of them, turn out to be true heroes. I think that every existing stereotype was neatly tucked into ""Aliens"" : the tough military bitch, the tough and dumb marine, the tough but not-all-that-dumb-marine, the brave little girl, the slick commercial weasel and so on... Even the score was annoying. Now I don't say I absolutely hated it, but judging from some of the comments, you might think that this is the best space-flick ever, which it definitely is not. I'm the first to accept that Ripley has managed to say frozen for fifty-something years, but not that she manages to integrate completely in the society she wakes up in, apparently in better shape than the marines. Even the little girl (who I thought quite endearing and very natural) was a better soldier than the military guys.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Aliens is an unparalleled essential that any sci-fi or horror fan needs to see.,"The original Alien (1979) set a new standard for sci-fi horror due to the fantastic vision and directing of the legendary director Ridley Scott. How could a green rookie director with just a handful of directing credits hope to top that? James Cameron found a way! Aliens improves on its predecessor in every way. Instead of a crew of civilian pilots fighting to survive a single alien, Cameron pits a squad of hardened space marines against an alien infestation. The experience, training, and advanced weaponry fail to protect them from the onslaught of alien xenomorphs, increasing the horror and hopelessness of the film. Cameron's camera work and perspective increase the tension, regularly showing the struggling survivors from the viewpoint of the stalking alien predator. The special effects, the action, the scale, the cast, the directing, the horror, and every other element of Aliens improve on the masterpiece of the original and result in the absolute gold standard of sci-fi horror.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Aliens Theatrical Cut is Superior,"Aliens (1986) Theatrical Cut ReviewAfter viewing the Aliens theatrical cut tonight, I became aware that I had not seen the theatrical cut since the special edition was released in 1991. The more I think about it, I may have never seen the actual theatrical cut. The first time I saw Aliens was during the television premiere broadcast on CBS in 1989, and even this version had additional scenes including the scene where Ripley discovers that she has outlived her daughter. There's a slight chance that I may have seen the theatrical version when it was shown on HBO, but I have no specific memory of that. I've even owned both versions for many years in my Legacy, Quadrilogy, and Anthology box sets, but always opted to watch the special edition.So, after finally seeing the original 1986 theatrical cut of Aliens, beautifully scanned and transferred in the Anthology set, it is a far better version of the film. This may go against popular opinion, but I now realize that nearly everything that I disliked about Aliens came from Cameron's special edition.First, on a technical level, the theatrical version is more tightly edited by Ray Lovejoy. Without the unnecessary special edition scenes which drags the film down, the pacing is quicker, intensifying both the action and the suspenseful scenes.Stylistically, the theatrical version is closer to the original Alien (1979). Again, without the extraneous scenes, the film is more visceral and mysterious, providing better continuity between the two films.Perhaps the biggest difference between the two versions is the addition of the scenes and dialog involving the fact that Ripley had a daughter and that she outlived her during her long hyper sleep. I understand that this might give more depth to her character and a more emotional connection to Newt, emphasizing Ripley's motherly bond, but again it was unnecessary.In fact, I've always questioned the entire idea of Ripley as a mother. First of all, Ripley is quite young in the first Alien film. It seems unlikely that a young warrant officer on a commercial towing starship would be a mother. These voyages into deep space would be long and arduous which would match better with a more detached lifestyle.Thus, the childless Ripley of the theatrical version of Aliens is more in line with the Ripley of Alien. Does not having a daughter take away from the motherly nature of Ripley after finding and caring for Newt? Not at all. On the contrary, it allows for her character to grow into a mother, which I find more positive and endearing. The familial nucleus of Ripley, Newt, and Hicks becomes more refreshing without the unnecessary angst created by the special edition.I won't go into other scenes that were added to the special edition in great detail, but while they make for some interesting visuals, they also feel contrived and forced. It just so happens that it's Newt's family seen entering the derelict spacecraft. Do we really need to see that? We can infer that something like that happened when we see the devastation in the colony. By not knowing what happened exactly, this creates more mystery. Also, Ripley confronts Burke regarding his directive to send colonists into the derelict. So again, seeing it visually doesn't add anything to the story.In the final analysis, most of the added scenes and dialog from the special edition are examples of bad writing. I always felt James Cameron's writing is quite infantile, so the theatrical cut greatly improves the film by eliminating the bad and unnecessary scenes and dialog. This is a great example where less is more. The first two films now go together much better and I can finally feel satisfied. For me, I'll just ignore the special edition and treat the additional scenes as just interesting bonus material. The theatrical cut is my preferred version of Aliens.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

More more more...but less of what made Alien so great.,"(I'm Dutch and do not speak/write English perfectly, beware!)Here and now, in 2011, I decided to watch both Alien movies. It was about time since I am 27 now and I love science fiction, but I never took the chance to watch these two movies. I'm not going to review them both of course, but Aliens is such a different movie than Alien is that I have to include my experience with the first movie.To summarize my night with the first movie: I LOVED it. Some viewers criticize Alien for having a slow pace but i think it is an essential feature of this movie being so effective. There are few scares, but the ones i got truly SCARED and HORRIFIED me. I also love the atmosphere, strengthened by the beautiful music and convincing effects, still holding up after 30 years. There is a loneliness in it all that just sucked me in, sitting alone myself in my room with the lights turned off.A few days later i started to watch 'Aliens', not knowing what to expect, besides a continuation of the story. Soon i discovered that Aliens is a truly different movie, and the difference in style didn't appeal to me first. Sure, Ripleys' situation is fascinating and the money-hungry CEO's made my empathize with Ripley even more but I really missed the buildup the first movie had. There, I felt isolated like the small crew in the ship, slowly being drawn to the alien horror. In Aliens, this feeling of isolation is largely absent as Ripley starts her second encounter being in contact with groups of people, being at safe distance from the threat.After an initial scare, the first half of the movie has a pretty slow pace compared to how the movie speeds up eventually. When the movie starts to pick up pace I loved most of the action scenes and after some early annoyance with Newt, I started to love the bond she developed with Ripley and I really wanted them to survive! So for me, the second half of the movie made up for the first half which I felt to be quite dull.But still, I feel the urge to write about what i consider Aliens' shortcomings because I had higher expectations of this movie. Maybe some of my points of critique arise because i am born in the eighties and raised with bombastic movies like Terminator (2), Robocop, Independence Day, and Starship Troopers. I guess I would have like this movie better if i would have seen it earlier, maybe then i wouldn't have felt the action movie deja vu feeling Aliens gave me.Deja vu, like the group of Marines. I've seen too many cool Marines on the big screen in my life. Sympathy for them did develop throughout the movie, but their 'badass' attitude made them far less human for me than the crew of the first movie. Talking about 'less human', I hated Burke from the start, it was just too obvious he was a lying weasel. I enjoyed him being killed, too bad the killing scene was too short in comparison with the disgust i felt for him!After 25 years, Despite my complaints, this is a pretty good movie with a fantastic finale. In retrospect it suffers from the existence of too many roller-coaster ride action movies which came out after 1986. And in this argument lies my appreciation of the first movie, it lacks explosions and bombast but that simplicity feels like a fresh breath of air in a landscape of action/horror movies trying to be bigger than the one before.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Trauma, suspense, a legend continued","I watched the special edition and it´s been a while since I saw the theatrical last so I have no idea if it´s better or worse.I think this is a great attempt at a sequel to one of my favorite horror movies ever made. While this one is more action oriented, I still think it captures some great suspense and horror but in no way on the same level as the original. While I have a lot to complain about in terms of the way the xenomorphs are portraited I still fell James Cameron captured the world of Ridley Scott's original vison and the mundanity of space and the sci-fi genre. Top this off with a great allegory for trauma, physical- and sexual assault and you have a strong sci-fi movie that pleases in many ways.After the Nostromo incident, Ellen Ripley is the only survivor and is found in cryosleep. She is woken up and asked to recall what happened on Nostromo and no one believes the alien incident. The planet the Nostromo crew visited has in the meanwhile been turned into a colony and alien attacks are happening again. Ripley is asked to help, and she most relive her nightmares.An aspect I really like about this movie is the way is more or less follows the same principles as the original. The people start out fine and confident, just another day on the job, is surprised by the aliens and then it becomes tactical survival with a strong climax. While you could call it a nearly blatant copy I see it as it´s own thing as the movie is more about the character Ripley and her literally reliving the exact same scenario she just woke up from. While the movie is set over 50 tears from the original, Ripley has just gotten back from cryosleep and is thrown back at the aliens right after, it´s a tough scenario.The cast is great in my opinion and while some line delivery is a bit stilted at times, I fell like the actors all get to shine. The comradery and overconfidence of the space marines are quickly replaced by horror, dead and fear and it´s interesting to see the movie shift this fast. But it makes sense. We are 50 year plus in the future, these guys have seen aliens before and action, they think this is just another mundane mission but is caught fighting something terrible. I think one of my favorite reactions is Bill Paxton as Hudson. He goes from this joking over the top character to a nervous reck and he has so many amazing lines in this movie. My favorite performance is Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. While she makes some stilted lines here and there her motherly performance with Newt is so believable and her intimate acting is incredible.While I will always prefer the original alien movie´s horror, I still love this movies horror elements. It still is a suspenseful movie with the moving sensors and there are some genuine horror moments that still works so great. It´s more relaying on dread and suspense than scares and body horror, but it works. It´s a movie about fearing running out of supplies, where the enemy is and how to overcome insane odds and the movie nails that.I think the action is good, but it is oversimplified by quick cuts. We never really get to see much of the killing, destruction or even the xenomorphs in general. The practical killings can look gruesome but it´s more about hiding the practicality at times which is a shame. I think the horror in this movie more comes from the idea of being overwhelmed. This is not like the original with one big bad, but an army that just keeps coming. The sense of being overwhelmed is captured well and from that perspective it makes sense not to give to much attention to the individual xenomorph. 'This is a fantastic movie taking on trauma. You can easily read Ripley´s encounters in the original as assault on many levels. Rape or physical, Ripley has endured and witnessed something truly terrifying that is staying with her. It´s fun to see the marines not understanding why Ripley is so sacred, to them this is just another day on the job, just like it was for Ripley in the original movie. The movie even indicates the reading with both Newt and Ripley nearly being impregnated and the movie doesn't say rape but has one scene where that is clearly implied. The way the movie talks about this subject, having nightmares, being afraid, but also being stronger and more experienced than those that haven't experienced this before is a strong metaphor and I love Ripley is doing everything in her power to help others overcome their new trauma and working on herself overcoming her own trauma. Rather if it´s trusting in robots, running from or fighting aliens or believing in the Wayland corp again, Ripley is forced to confront all of her demons at the same time.I most be a bit mad about the way the xenomorph is portrayed here. In the original movie the xenomorph is presented as this nearly unstoppable force of pure instinct and evil and it will forever be that to me. It is not presented that way here. It´s just a drone that is easily killed and disposed of, and their great numbers are what really makes them dangerous. To me the xenomorph has to be this ultimate animal that can´t easily be defeated and that is not the case here, mostly because we have to hype up the new big bad. I will give it some leeway by saying sure, the marines have better and more hardcore technology and the first time we saw the xenomorph it was attacking a cargo crew and not soldiers that were prepared to fight. Set a man with a gun up against a lion and it´s 50/50 who is coming out on top. The lion is the better predator for sure, but we have evolved our technology which is why the marines aren't scared anymore, the mundanity Scott captured in the original, where space travel is portrayed as boring is captured beautifully here, for the marines it´s just another job, another alien thread, it´s boring and mediocre to them and respect to Cameron to translate that so well.I also love that the sci-fi technology seems rather believable here. There is always a layer of fantasy in sci-fi where something is invented that is a bit too unbelievable, but the believability of this world is great. It´s just explosives round, big tv screens, oxygen producers, sonars, cryosleep and that's about it. Again, the mundanity of space. It´s exciting when we do it the first time, but after the 100th time it´s just something we do.The practical effects are great here. The way sets look are amazing, capturing the cold atmosphere of Scotts prior movie. I love the way guns, costumes, and equipment looks. It all looks and feels practical. The cars and planes look great and the xenomorphs look good but are barely visible. The facehuggers get some time to shine here and the eggs they come out of look gross. The alien nest is so well done capturing Gigers vison very well. While some practical aliens can look stiff at times I still appreciate the practical approach. And the best looking thing in this movie is the queen, by god she looks incredible. Her design and movement is iconic and so well done in the movie. While she will never live up to the first time I saw the original alien, she is still absolutely a marvel in practical effects.There are a few things I feel could have been better in the movie. As mentioned, some lines are a bit stilted, some effects a bit stiff, some set ups are a bit too obvious and feels written and some of Ripley's trauma moments feels like they have a rushed overcoming.But this is still an incredible sci-fi horror. The atmosphere and themes are incredible. The cast, the design and aliens are all great and overall this is a marvel in practical effects and designs with a great story.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A worthwile sequel with its own character,"""Aliens"" is the sequel of ""Alien"" (1979, Ridley Scott). It is only slightly worse than the first film (which is an achievement in itself) and a balanced mix of continuity and changes.In the first place ""Aliens"" is much more action oriented than his predecessor, especialy in the second half. The title of the film already indicates that this time there are multiple monsters. Also telling are the subtitles on the posters. The subtitle of ""Alien"" is: ""In space no one can hear you scream"" (loneliness). The subtitle of ""Aliens"" is: ""This time it's war"" (action). The action comes from the aliens of course but also from the heavy armed marines that form the crew of the spaceship. This marines are so heavy armed that they start to look like some form of Cyborgs. The sheer weight of their equipment causes them to move in a very peculiar way that ads to the tension of the movie.The second diffence is the theme of the movie. In ""Alien"" the best known scenes are related to the way the alien reproduces itself. So the theme of this movie can be labeled as ""birth"". In ""Aliens"" main character Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) takes care of an orphaned girl. In the final fight her opponent is the queen of the aliens population. So the theme of ""Aliens"" can be labeled as ""motherhood"".There is also continuity between the films. In both cases the crew of the spaceship consists of blue collar workers (which is unusual in science fiction films). In both films there are clues that the company behind the spaceship is willing to sacrifice the crew if necessary. In both films the first expedition outside the spaceship is to an abandoned place (a foreign spaceship (""Alien"") and a colony for earthlings (""Aliens"") respectively). These scenes have much in common. The tension is in anticipation of the monsters, that we do not see yet. After this scene ""Aliens"" becomes more action ariented and the films start to diverge in character.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A solid and worthy sequel,"It's a shame that Cameron now only makes $3 billion dollar blue alien sci-fi military porn video-game cut scenes.From the start, it's clear that James Cameron's take on the Alien franchise is more of an action-packed war approach than the horror approach of Ridley Scott.There are a lot of similarities between this sequel and Cameron's work on the first two Terminator films, and even the Avatar films. From the set pieces, military characters, set designs, and many other filmmaking approaches, it is undeniably in pursuit of being it's own thing in comparison to the first one, and is undoubtedly a Cameron film.The supporting cast is good, but not as good as the ones in the first film. Everything does feel bigger in traditional Cameron fashion, he has a unique way of providing scope to everything and expanding worlds as he did in T2. Signory Weaver's Ripley continues to be one of the most interesting characters in any blockbuster franchise, I particularly liked how they focused on her PTSD from the last film.The young girl subplot felt a bit out of place, but it did provide a very good action-centric third act. I was very surprised by the turns at the end of it.

Sequels have never been this great!(This is an extension of the review I wrote on February 2007)If ALIEN was the 2001 of monster movies, its sequel ALIENS is its STAR WARS. Here's a sequel that knows that the only thing that would satisfy its fans is to give 'em exactly what they wanted. Then ALIENS adds in a little more to that successful recipe: breathless action, gripping tension, reliable characters and the slimiest monsters in all of movie history. The result isn't only a sequel that's better than the original, its one of the best movies of the genre.Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) reawakened from here naturally-long hypersleep which began at the finale of the first ALIEN. Forward 57 years later. The world she knew was unlike anything she has seen before, but she really has no time to know anything else than this: the distant planet LV-426, the planet where they encountered the hostile space killer, has been colonized. And when communication on the LV-426 colony is lost, Ripley agrees to return to the hostile alien planet, this time, accompanied by marines, to investigate the sudden communication loss. Of course, this ain't just a technical failure. The slimy alien from the first film times 10 has overrun the colony, turning in into a dark, gooey wasteland; the perfect place for an all-out war that pits top-tech Marines against the slimiest monsters ever.As a monster movie, ALIENS gives you your due, but not contented simply to give you your money's worth, ALIENS offers more, unexpected surprises. For a monster picture, there are some genuinely pleasant characters existing here. Sigourney Weaver, who hit big time for being the most reliable female action heroine in the original ALIEN, is able to stretch the personality of her character here. This time, we are able to see Ripley's maternal instincts when she claims responsibility for the safety of Newt (Carrie Henn), a little girl who has successfully survived the apocalypse of the outside world she lives in by climbing through hidden ducts. The climax inside the exploding atmosphere processing station won't soon be forgotten, and I'm not just talking about the explosions. In fact, I bet ALIENS is one kind of film you won't soon forget. Not the words you drop on an explosive monster movie.Rating: ***** out of 5.154-min Special Edition DVD review (submitted March 10, 2009): And to think, I thought ALIENS was good enough as it is! This Special Edition DVD, which I bought a few days ago, is everything this ALIENS fan could ever want. 17 minutes of additional footage, deleted prior to the films original 1986 release, is added in able to deepen the emotions and character development of this terrific film, while it also adds an additional (though easily expendable) action scene. The first added scene shows the newly awakened Ripley discovering that her daughter has just died... at the age of 60. So much for being there on her 11th birthday. But the scene everyone will get a real kick from is the scene where we catch a glimpse of the LV-426 colony before it is overrun by aliens, as well as a look on Newt and her family. Another scene has Ripley and Hicks exchange first names, which deepens the relationship between them. Add to that, there are a few extended scenes on the Sulaco and the Colony stations, as well as the aforementioned action scene which has the aliens cleverly trying to pass through the barricade of automatic weapons. Then of course, the film is presented in a clear, pristine transfer which makes the film look good for something released back in 1986. The special features aren't big, but if the best possible way to see this modern classic is what I'm looking for, I already got my end of the bargain.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The ultimate proof that a sequel can be better than the original,"I do not believe the theory that all originals are better than their sequels, end of story. I think most originals are better, but any time I think of a sequel that is better than the original, two movies come to mind. One of them is Terminator 2.The other is Aliens. Aliens is by far, the best in the series of four ""Alien"" movies, and one of the greatest action/sci-fi movies of all time. As much as I enjoyed Alien, I believe that Aliens was better in many many ways.One of which are, of course, character development. Ripley is a much more interesting character in this movie than she was in the first one. You can see her determination in every move she makes. (I also recommend seeing the special edition, which has additional scenes within them. You get more of a feel for Ripley's character when you know more about her daughter.) I think the marines are extremely cool. I think Hudson is the most interesting character of all.  Gorman is very interesting too. You watch him turn from a cowardly pathetic loser to an actual brave soldier. Burke, who tried to betray the group for money, is also a great villain.The aliens themselves are much cooler. Now you can see that they aren't just brainless animals who do nothing but kill. They are actually very smart animals who do nothing but kill. In Alien there was only one, so you didn't get to see how well they work in packs, lead people into traps, guard the Queen or cut the power before going into battle. And of course, since there are more aliens that means more of them can be killed, which means more carnage and more excitement. (This also applies to the human characters).There is never a dull moment in Aliens. I love watching it over and over, it never gets boring.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Switches from suspense to action, presenting a fairly solid case for one of the great sequels of all time.","Switching the focus from suspense to action wisely reduces the risk of direct comparison, making this sequel one of the few that presents a solid case for perhaps besting the original. For me, 'Aliens (1986)' is slightly weaker than its predecessor but is still a fun experience with some engaging set-pieces (especially a tension-filled face-off with a face-hugger) and a fantastic finale. It is at its best when it brings in the suspense elements that the series so desperately needs, but it always keeps a keen focus on the horrific nature of its eponymous creatures even though their impact is severely diluted this time around. It successfully follows up one of the best horror films of all time and doesn't just rehash it, which is to be admired, but also manages to stand alone as a great film. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best sequel ever made?,I'm gonna say Godfather two and this. I don't want to knock alien because I think it is a masterpiece but this thing has slightly surpassed it.Maybe a better way to say it is the alien is that slow burn suspense where you are trying to figure everything out. There's not really much mystery going on in aliens but it is still masterfully done in a way that keeps you on the edge of your seat. We of course know what the monster is already in this movie but we love it.I just read a whole thing about how David Fincher got screwed over on the third alien movie and I feel bad for him having to try to live up to the first two movies. I just don't see how you could ever match this. Cameron's a genius.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The one that destroyed the franchise,"I must say that this was the last in the series of the four alien movies I saw. First I saw Alien 3, then the original Alien, I catched Alien: Resurrection in the theaters and finally I got my chance to see this one. I was pretty excited to finally see the film that everybody told nothing but good, but after the film... Well, I felt a bit betrayed.The original Alien was more like a Lovecraftian mystery than an action film. The creature that was hardly seen and when it was seen it looked like something diffrent than your normal man in a rubber suit (ala Predator), like something that could just stand next to the ships walls and dissapear to the dark painting of gaslines. This was something that Cameron refused to understand. Propably thinking of Starship Troopers without having to pay the rights for the book, Cameron wrote the story of Aliens. Ripley, after escaping the alien in the first film, is revived after drifting in space for a long long time and is given a change to make his revenge with a group of space marines at her side. First problem with the film is the script. It's very traditional following everything taught by the ""now you can write a script too""-books. No true surprises, everybody is motivated and follows their lines with boring results. A special thanks to Gormans actor for his campy performance during the first attack. Just the fact that Siquorney was nominated for an oscar for this role makes you wonder by what standards do they choose in the Academy. The dark gothic look of the Alien is gone, replaced by Camerons ""blue""-look than can be found in his every movie. The Alien has been redesigned to look more like a skeleton than the shiny tubular biomechanoid of the first one. It's a good thing they returned to the original design in Alien3. The action is your usual Cameron. Slow, with huge fireballs.Finally the idea about the Queen just destroyed the mystery surrounding the alien creature. In Alien the creature showed some strange signs by toying with its prey and propably raping Lambert. In this one, the creatures are just mindless drones thats main purpose is to kill. Thus Cameron manages to take away the horror of the original Alien. Even the facehugger gets a facelift to look a little bit less menacing. And the overhyped queen? Looking at the queen and comparing it with the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park 3 makes you just wonder if Stan Winstons studio can ever get that stutter out of their animatronics, since Jim Henson studios have been without it for years. The good things about this campy action movie? Well, there are some pretty good effect shots, like the ones of the dropship and the final battle. But in the end this film will be admired by people without the patience to look at something like Alien or The Thing. But in my mind it will always be like Commando: Funny as hell at the points it's supposed to be dead serious.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"From Horror to Action, Another Sci-Fi Masterpiece","Whilst Ridley Scott's 'Alien' felt firmly within the horror genre, James Cameron's sequel switches from a single ominous menace to an onslaught in the action-packed 'Aliens'. Both films are perfect in their own right.A fantastic continuation of the plot from it's predecessor, 'Ripley' develops as a character from a (badass) survivor to a (badass) leader. The whole roster of other characters add to the military theme, and although a couple can be a little clunky at first, and more stereotypical than the first film would allow, they each grow into their own, providing their own memorable scenes and quips. 'Bishop' especially flourishes as an individual character due to the plot of the previous film.Weaver is simply excellent, showing her range from power to vulnerability, and her iconic character would not be the same without her performance. She is supported again by fantastic set work, costuming and puppetry, which are all unbelievably realistic.Horror is not at the forefront of Aliens, but tension still fills the film. A little longer to get into action, the foundations built on at the beginning of the film really contribute to the underlying arcs in the story, particularly for the likes of Burke.Thoroughly enjoyable, pulse-raising action to continue a great franchise build around an excellent lead character and her titular foes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Among all the James Cameron movies, this one is the absolute best!","Aliens has literally everything I look for in an action movie. The cast is the base of this movie's greatness, as each supporting character has a very equal level of importance. You know its not a James Cameron film without the inclusion of a powerful female character, and Ripley serves as the archetype for the perfect female lead character. Ellen Ripley's roles as an astronaut, soldier, and mother help make her the perfect choice to lead this group of soldiers in the fight against the Alien. The Aliens in this movie are back and man are they scary. James Cameron's close attention to the special effects once again helps elevate all aspects of his movie. Everything from the Aliens to the movie sets add to the thrill and suspense of this movie. Finally on top of all of that, you have Hudson. Hudson well, you'll just have to watch the movie to see why Bill Paxton's Hudson is the best part of Aliens. Overall, if you are looking for a movie with action, comedy, thrills, and some frightening moments, than this is the best movie you could possibly choose.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Aliens menacing and agile.,"The planet from Alien (1979) has been colonised, but contact is lost and a rescue team is dispatched. This 1986 sequel is action packed, bigger, louder, very gung-ho with Vietnam parallels.I'm torn I must say that at the time Aliens was the best action sci-fi films ever and probably still is, but overtime, I have grown less fond of Aliens and prefer the first Alien and re-edit of the 3rd.What is superior about Aliens is that it builds on what Ridley Scott created in first film, (even though some of Aliens ideas are based on cut scenes) surprise killings, misdirection and so on. The design and movement of the Alien is greatly improved, making the Alien far more menacing and agile than before. Space is stark, dark and cold and James Cameron captures the isolation and ominous atmosphere perfectly, with an effective use of lighting, shadow and set design.There's no doubt that Cameron is an exceptional director and writer. All the characters are built up slowly, Lance Henriksen as the synthetic Bishop and Paul Reiser as Burke give subtle performances. Michael Biehn as Hicks and Sigourney Weaver are terrific. Ripley as a character is fleshed out further and the effects and sound are amazing (winning Best Visual Effects and Best Sound Effects).Aliens is an unsurpassed solid sci-fi horror sequel packed with action and suspense but in retrospect it really is Alien pumped with more Ripley, testosterone and guns.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Could be the greatest sequel of all time.,"Sequels rarely stand up to the original. Jaws, Jurassic Park and Predator are all big Hollywood franchises that started at a very high standard but as time continued they simply grew worse and worse. However there are those sequels that many believe to be better than their predecessors. The Godfather part 2 and The Empire strikes back are a few of the names but in my opinion the best of this rare breed is the 2nd in the Alien saga. Aliens. The story starts with Ripley being found in space, shes has been floating their for 56 years but due to hyper sleep hasn't aged a day. The company Weyland Yutani picks here up and brings here back to a space station, where She tells them of her encounter of the Alien, which is met with ridicule and disbelief. However the company looses contact with the farmers that mine on the alien planet and together with a group of marines Ripley returns to face her demons. The acting is the best the series ever offered with Sigourney Weaver picking up an Oscar nomination and rightly so. Michael Biehn and Lance Hennrikson are very impressive, giving great depth to their characters. Carrie Henn is a great new comer, but for some odd reason has never worked again. The thrills are in high supply here as are the often grisly scares. The Aliens look even meaner here than they did in the original and the Queen when she appears is possibly the most frightening creature ever to grace are screens. Another great point Aliens offers is the fact you care for its characters, Even the asshole marine types. This means that when ever peril is near we feel even more anxious, simply because we have grown attached to those for whom the danger looms. Few movies these days have that quality, indeed the only action orientated film of the last 15 years that had this factor is the original Jurassic Park. So to conclude Aliens is really worth seeing. Its well acted, well written and highly entertaining. You would be a fool to give this one a miss.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The best sci fi/action ever made,"If Alien is the best sci fi horror ever made then Aliens is most definitely the best sci fi action ever made. James Cameron made sure that his film was a different movie from the first and succeeds greatly.57 years after the end of Alien, Sigourney Weaver's Ripley is found floating in space and bought back to earth where her story is greeted with disbelief and the planet where she met the Alien is now a colony. And this is just the fist ten minutes of the movie. Once contact is lost with the colony, the story ramps up a gear as Ripley accompanies a team of marines to the planet. Did, I say ramp up a gear, I mean goes into overdrive.The suspense on arrival at the planet does well at building up the tension and also means that we get to actually know the characters, the incompetent lieutanent, Jeanette Goldstein's bad ass Private Vasquez, Bill Paxton's comic relief Hudson and Michael Biehn's Corporal Hicks. And once the aliens attack we're treated to a non stop roller-coaster ride of a movie. There's also a good human storyline as Ripley take's charge of the only colonist remaining, eight year old Newt (Carrie Henn in her one and only role) while the marines are slowly picked off and Ripley is forced to confront her demons.Despite being 20 years old now, this film still stands out. Sigourney Weaver was nominated for an Oscar for her performance while the effects did win. Despite massive advances in CGI and effects since 1986, the effects in Aliens still stand up and actually work better. The Alien's aren't computers, they do exist even the monstrous Alien Queen, making for the mother of all show downs.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Another overrated ""classic""","The first Alien film is considered a classic but I didn't particularly like it. This sequel is also considered a classic and I like this one even less than the first. At least the first one had a little tension. This one is just a shoot-em-up action thriller. See Aliens, shoot Aliens. Repeat as necessary. This makes for a thriller which is not particularly thrilling. Things get rather repetitive and monotonous. The film can't surprise us, we already know what the Alien is, what it's capable of. This time there are just more of them.The film picks up with our heroine Ellen Ripley awaking from a 57-year nap. While she was dozing a human colony has been established on the planet where she encountered the Alien all those years ago. In an amazingly convenient plot contrivance contact with that colony is lost soon after Ripley wakes up. Gee, what could have happened? A reluctant Ripley is sent back out into space with a team of Colonial Marines to investigate. These Marines are, by and large, idiots. They get to the colony. Surprise, nobody's there! Oh wait, they do find one survivor, a little girl who spends the rest of the movie screeching ""Ripley!"" at the top of her lungs in exceedingly annoying fashion. Speaking of annoying the most idiotic of the idiotic Marines is Pvt. Hudson, played in excruciatingly terrible fashion by Bill Paxton. With this character we're talking Jar Jar Binks levels of annoying. Just shut up. Please. Every time this guy opens his mouth you dearly wish an Alien would turn up and devour him.In the first film Ripley was not the only character you cared about. There the rest of the crew, with one notable exception, were sympathetic figures as well. No such luck here. There's one guy, Corporal Hicks, who comes off reasonably well. The rest are a collection of morons, jerks and slimeballs. With an incredibly annoying child thrown in to boot. Sigourney Weaver does the best she can, turning in a solid performance as Ripley. But she gets precious little help. Michael Biehn is pretty good as Hicks and Lance Henriksen has some good moments as an android but everyone else is quite terrible. Paxton goes way beyond terrible, he is truly wretched. The story, such as it is, doesn't thrill you. The movie takes its sweet time getting to the Alien planet and once we get there it's just a shooting gallery. Aliens attack, they get shot. More Aliens attack, they get shot. More Aliens attack, they get shot. Eventually we come to the big finish. Here the movie does have some surprises for you if you haven't already lost interest. But ultimately this ending, like everything which precedes it, falls flat. The climactic battle is visually impressive but really quite silly. Honestly you can say that about the film as a whole. It looks good but the story is a dud. Genuine frightful moments are very few and far between. Suspense is sorely lacking. Characters say and do some of the stupidest things. And an Alien apparently knows how to work an elevator. Going up? No, this movie is going down, crash-landing with a thud.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"This film just works, like the first one does, it's as simple as that","This film just works, like the first one does, it's as simple as that. Cameron found a way to preserve the spirit of the original while taking it in a new direction and expanding on its characters and universe in what feels like an effortless and wholly inevitable follow up to the original classic - he knew the same old shtick just wouldn't cut it this time around.So instead the film jumps genre - a lot of people regard this as an action movie though I think they're off by one. This is an action- thriller, or an action-suspense movie. The scenes of gun shooting and alien running and jumping is played first as suspense, and then as thriller, wrapped in an ostensible action package. It's more like trying to fight back against the invincible boogeyman than it is just mowing down hordes of faceless baddies.The special effects by Stan Winston are out of this world. Maybe the best mechanical and miniatures of the entire series (it's ironic that the parts that aged the worst are the old CGI). The Queen and her egg laying is just as gnarly as ever. The Alien slowly rising out of the water behind Newt is an all-time iconic shot.Sigourney Weaver is never better than in this film. She's given just a bit more characterization this time around, involving the subtext of mothers and daughters, but it never overtakes the story and most of its emotion is brought through in her performance. There's a shot of her smoking a cigarette near the beginning, with a long untapped piece of ash hanging from it, that says everything just from the way she holds herself. She has to go back and fight, there's nothing left for her in the ""real"" world. She takes what she learned in the original and here becomes an ultimate badass heroine for the ages.This is a prototypical Cameron movie. I'm not sure how he does it but he takes seemingly simple plots and characterizations and makes them fresh, exciting, thrilling, and acceptable to the audience, while honoring the pacing and rhythms without flourishes or indulgence and still manages runtimes in excess of 2 hours. The 2 1/2 hour director's cut here is superior in every way, and it doesn't even feel longer.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Does Not Live Up to Scott's Alien,"Seven years after the release of Ridley Scott's Alien, James Cameron took the helm of the sequel, Aliens, starring Sigourney Weaver and Bill Paxton. Aliens, picks up five decades in the future, with the discovery of Ripley still in her cryo-chamber. After her recovery, Ripley is tasked with a rescue mission, to find out what happened to a group of colonists after their signal has been lost. Alongside Ripley, is a military group that brings heavy machinery and firepower, but is it enough to put an end to what is going on, on the colonist's moon?Hailed as one of the best in the series, and an iconic action film, I went to Aliens with pretty high expectations, and left feeling completely underwhelmed. The film itself felt very generic, and slow, I was never completely interested in what was happening on screen, so much of the film sets up to these huge action moments, and though the sequences were well choreographed and cool, everything else about this film felt very bland. Many of the characters in this film were just complete morons and never found myself rooting for them. Outside of Ripley, I did not like one character. I'm not sure whether that was Cameron's intention, but with so much of the film based around these military personals, and their development, I couldn't wait to see some of them die. Now if the army boneheads weren't aggravating enough, the filmmakers thought it'd be a brilliant idea to bring a child into the mix, and oh, man. What a mistake that was. I can understand the writer's choice to add Newt as a character to the story, as it adds more dilemma to the plot, however most of the time, it just seemed like a plot convenience to further extended the runtime of the climax and the actresses chosen to bring Newt to life was just awful. Many of her awkward line deliveries and forced screams, so rather than care about this character, I just found myself getting annoyed.Now this film isn't all bad, like I was saying the action in this film is fantastic, and the practical effects used, really held up and still looked good to this day. It's just a shame that this movie suffers so much from being uninspired, I never felt moments of intensity and half the time I was just bored. Maybe it's because I've seen films like this done better nowadays, and it's just a movie stuck in its time, or my feelings of disdain towards this movie, is drawn to the concept mainly being used in a science-fiction horror movie and not sci-fi action.I've seen this movie a couple times now, and both times, I've felt bored and disappointed, I can see the love some individuals have for this film, but it is just not for me. It is a competent film, however it suffers from weak characters and a lack of originality. If you were a fan of Alien, I would recommend checking this film out, just know it is not for everyone and definitely not perfect, Aliens gets a 5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Aliens,"Bishop: ""Not bad, for a (monster movie)."" Sigourney Weaver, the John Wayne of cinema Space, returns for this super sequel to the box office hit, Alien (79), playing the sole survivor of the prior mission who, after awakening from a nightmare (gulp), is asked by corporate sponsors (Reiser) to return to the scene of the crime, so to speak, as an advisor to a privatized military mission sent to assess a non-responsive settlement. Michael Biehn (Hicks) co-stars as the Marine corporal who assumes command, fellow Terminator cast member, Lance Henrikson is the resident android, Bill Paxton nervy Pvt Hudson (""Game over!"") & little Carrie Henn (Newt) makes it a family, she, like her adoptive mom, a sole survivor & top strategist (""They mostly come out at night, mostly"").Additional Terminator talent would join the project in director / writer James Cameron (+ Giler Hill), producer Gale Anne Hurd and actress Jenette Goldstein (T2-JD) (Vasquez). An action-horror film never had so much love, and, like expansive sequels Bride of Frankenstein and T2-JD, surpassed its innovative original and should've been the finale, the franchise becoming more tiresome with each new one spawned. An interesting note: In the future, according to Aliens' writers, the people of Earth will no longer be saying 'awesome' every sentence. There IS hope (4/4).",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
pretty good,"Very well made film and an excellent continuation on the previous movie. A lot of improvements with almost none of the drawbacks, and overall just a better film. All in all, the peak of the series.7/10: very good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Would've work better as its own film instead of a sequel,"Sequel to one of the greatest sci-fi/horror films ever made—a genre so difficult to execute so wonderfully—comes along and sucks out any horror aspect that made ""Alien"" so fantastic. Instead, James Cameron replaces Ridley Scott in the director's seat and inserts sci-fi clichés and predictable thriller aspects, resulting in this overlong and unnecessary picture.Cameron seems to spend a good length developing characters that are either unlikable and just there for the sake of dying, with a total disregard for driving the story forward. Even in comparing character development to ""Alien"", the sequel proves weaker. ""Alien"" was able to develop deeper and realistic characters in a much shorter timeframe, and didn't need more characters than the story required.Anything new to Cameron's picture is nothing more than convenient plot-devices, thus lacking any shred of cleverness. Aside from Weaver's presence, the film hardly reminds us of the original. The film leaps too forward without any respect for its roots, totally lacking gratefulness.At no point in the film is it easy to actually point out how ""Aliens"" is a necessary/needed follow up. The film may very well have worked better as it's own with all new characters and no continuity to ""Alien"", but it simply just doesn't work as a follow up; which is actually disappointing because if you want to look at what a ""good"" sequel is, Cameron accomplished it with ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"". Everything on which the story stands relies on ""The Terminator"", however it doesn't need the ""remember when""s to move forward. With ""Aliens"", the story itself is not heavily relied on by ""Alien"", and again, pretty much Weaver is our only feeling of continuation. And again, given the fact that it's just a small and irrelevant reminder, the movie simply doesn't work as a sequel but rather a film of it's own. The fact of the matter is, it's not a film of its own; ""Aliens"" is a sequel, and it simply wasn't done right.Was it entertaining? Sure, whatever. But upon examining filmmaking basics, however, the film fails at the follow up aspect story-wise and goes way off in a direction of its own. That's not a bad thing if it's an original movie. It's not even a bad thing for a sequel of the film shows heavy purpose in the decision to ranch off.After watching ""Aliens"", if the question rose: ""Why does this particular story need to be a follow up to 'Alien'? What is it about 'Alien' that this film needs to be in the same continuity?"" The answer is that it doesn't. ""Alien"" was a successful film, therefore the studio can have a head-start at making another film by throwing in meaningless nods and references to the successful film preceding it in hopes that this film (""Aliens"") will be just as successful. Cameron probably wouldn't even be able to give a solidly confident contradiction to this claim.** (out of four)",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Iconic, yet disappointing.","I've kicked off 2025 watching all the Alien films in order, that's the plan anyway. Some I've seen before, some will be new to me. Aliens is a rewatch. James Cameron takes over from Ridley Scott and it shows. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is back and now very much the focal point and the star. We meet her here in hypersleep on the frozen ship she escaped in at the end of Alien. Rescued, but now on a space station, she meets Burke (Paul Reiser). An irritating company man, he'll only get more annoying as the film goes on, but that's his point. The tech has all improved, that's because she's been floating in space for 57 years. The average IQ hasn't though. The bureaucrats don't believe her story... but they'll soon realise they need her. It turns out that planet where the Alien ship was found last time, is now in the process of being colonised by workers that soon discover they're not alone and off we go again. All the slow build tension of the original is tossed out the window. I guess we've seen how a face-hugger works, but this is still clunky. The company lose touch with the colony... obviously and ask Ripley to return, with a bribe to give her back her officer status after destroying her last ride. Ripley though only has one reason to return, to wipe the Aliens out. Cue a tooled up rag-tag bunch of soldiers accompanying her back in to deep space. All instantly dislikable, not a brain cell between them. Dull dialogue machines. Honestly Cameron, he really is a terrible director. One of the few characters, alongside Ripley, with any nuance is Bishop (Lance Henriksen) and he's an Android, which of course Ripley isn't keen on. To be honest with all the ridiculous yahoo American bravado, I'm rooting for the Aliens to kill em all. As the team reach the colony planet, it's like Vietnam in space. A handy atmosphere stabilising machine does away with the need for space suits though, so really this could be anywhere. I mean, why on earth are they wearing camouflage gear. All its many issues and monolithic inaccuracies aside, it is a good suspenseful action thriller. Weaver, although given some terrible lines is great and the Aliens are of course fantastic. It benefits a lot from everything set-up in the original, but adds little to it. It knows it's ace are the Aliens, so we're made to wait. Slowly teasing. The discovery of Newt (Carrie Henn), the last survivor of the colony adds a little more sentiment to all the posturing and she does add at least one more character that you want to survive. It does look good too. A nice mix of scrungy of the time miniatures that look cool and occasionally a bit Thunderbirds. The budget has clearly gone on the Aliens, that quite frankly still look incredible. Trapped, the remaining cast go full A-Team as they try to make it to the end of the bloated 140 minute runtime and eliminate the Aliens. Except that's not the brief is it. This is the era of the franchise boom that we're still suffering. If you don't like endless films bleeding an idea dry, blame this... and Rocky. It's a terrible sequel considering what it had to work with, but the finale, nuts as it is, is undeniably iconic and worth sticking around for.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Strong Follow-up to a Classic,"This film is one that I saw before the original. It was in a regular rotation for me and my sister growing up. What is interesting though is that it didn't start from the beginning on the taped VHS he had. It wasn't until college that I finally saw this movie all the way through. I've since then giving it a few viewings. Most recently it was with Jaime as this appeared on our poster for the top 100 films on the Internet Movie Database. The synopsis here is fifty-seven years after surviving an apocalyptic attack aboard her space vessel by merciless space creatures, Officer Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) awakens from hyper-sleep and tries to warn anyone who will listen about the predators.As the synopsis states, we start in the escape vessel where Ripley is still in deep sleep. A salvage ship found her and she is taken to a spaceship. It is there that she meets with Burke (Paul Reiser who relays information to her, including that her daughter has passed away. It is taking time for her to readjust as she has nightmares from her encounter.Part of what she has to do is inform a board about what happened on this planet. They don't believe her though and part of the reason is that it has been colonized since she went into her hyper-sleep. They found nothing of what she claims to have happened. She loses her license with the company. To make ends meet, she gets a job working on the docks as a loader.In the extended cut, we shift to this planet where a family travels toward a destination. They are subcontractors and check out a ship that's crashed. It is the same one from the first movie. The mother freaks out as something has attached itself to her husband's face and their daughter sees everything. She goes by the nickname of Newt (Carrie Henn).We cut back to Burke coming to visit Ripley along with Lieutenant Gorman (William Hope). They've lost contact with the colony and the company wants her to go with a unit of marines as a consultant. If she does go, they will restore her to her status. She declines at first, but Burke leaves his card. Ripley has another nightmare of aliens and decides to go.This unit is led by Lt. Gorman. Under his command are Corporal Hicks (Michael Biehn), Private Hudson (Bill Paxton), Sergeant Apone (Al Matthews) and Private Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein) to name a few. They have an android along with them by the name of Bishop (Lance Henriksen). Learning of this upsets Ripley with what happened last time. He tries to put her fears at ease, but it doesn't work. The marines are tough and ignore Ripley when she tells them about the alien race they will encounter. They think they can take out anything.The group is filled in on their mission and arrives on the planet. They find it empty. All of the colonists are missing. That is until they find Newt. She's been hiding out in the ducts and Ripley is able to get to her. They try to figure out what happened here, but she is mostly in a catatonic state. The unit expands to find that all of the colonists are kept in another location. They go there to find out what happened to them and get much more than they bargained for. Ripley thought her previous ordeal was bad, but this is much worse than she could ever imagine.That will be where I leave my recap. Something I wanted to delve into first would be that growing up, I preferred this sequel over the original. I have come to realize they are two different types of movies. Where the first one is all about suspense, the fear of being trapped while they are stalked by the alien, where this is one is more of an action film where they have to battle to stay alive. There is a lot of action in this one that is good. Jaime even prefers this one for that reason. As a more purist horror fan, I've come to love the original more.As a sequel, this movie does what I want from one. We have Ripley, our lone survivor from the original so we have that familiarity there. I like that instead of a crew that isn't trained in killing, we get a group of space marines. Seeing the xenomorphs lay waste to them makes it even scarier for me since they're more capable of handling threats. It is great to see Ripley do more of what she did previously since she is more resourceful. She also knows how dangerous they are compared to her counterparts.The last part for the story I want to delve into here is that not everyone considers this to be a horror movie. This is more of an action, adventure, sci-fi movie for sure. I would still put this into the horror movie category though, especially with how the aliens came to be and how they tear through our characters as well. It just isn't the first genre that I would put it into.That should be enough for the story, so I'll take this over to the acting then. Weaver is great once again as Ripley. She is this role and we see growth for her. The most recent view that I did was the theatrical cut. I noticed it left out a bit of her back-story which I think is a misstep. It explains why she clings to Newt like she does. Speaking of which, Henn isn't great. She's also a kid so I won't harp too much there. Biehn is solid here. He just works so well in action movies like this. Reiser I think is good as this character that we don't fully trust in the beginning since he's a company guy. Where he ends up makes a lot of sense. I like Henriksen as Bishop. Paxton does a lot of overacting here that does wear thin. The role of Hope is an interesting one. From there I'd say Matthews, Mark Rolston, Goldstein and the rest of the soldiers are good.So then the last things to go into would be the effects, cinematography and the soundtrack. For the former, I like the look of the xenomorphs here. We are expanding on what we got in the previous one which is good. The familiar ones are back and we get more of them. There is also an added bonus during the third act that is interesting. The cinematography is well done, but knowing that James Cameron was behind the camera, it makes sense. Other than that the soundtrack fits the movie for what is needed as well.In conclusion here, this movie is still solid to me. It isn't as good as the original, but I like for my sequel to build on what made the previous one good. We are getting more of the xenomorphs, a higher body count and just more interactions in general. I don't think the acting is as strong, but not by much. The effects are good along with how this is shot and the soundtrack fits for what they needed here. My stance on this one has come down the older I've gotten. I still enjoy this one quite a bit and think it is a good movie.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good, But Needs To Be Taken Down A Few Pegs","Alien was a suspenseful, sci-fi horror film. Aliens decided to add more aliens and abandon most of the suspense and horror in exchange for action. That'd be fine, if it weren't so meat-headed.The first major problem is the film uses a large number of people as cannon fodder, nothing else. Nothing is more infuriating than when an action film has absolutely no respect for human life. These mercenaries are annoying jock stereotypes whose death has zero effect on me. Seriously, these wastes of space have no wonder or fear over monstrous aliens? Nuts to that. Those scenes sucked.The other issue is how the action is shot. Normally, cinematography is not something I pay attention to. Its like controls in video games - its just assumed you can shoot stuff right. Maybe some rare talent can create something impressive. But its impossible to ignore how jumpy the camera gets when the action picks up. Gunfire, CUT, alien screams, CUT, guy fires again, CUT, guy gets bitten, CUT, show his face, CUT, back to his arm. Jesus Christ, calm down! You don't need to hide these special effects!Once the mercenaries are decimated, and the camera decides to act normal, it gets better. Once again, the setting and effects are great. You truly believe we are on some different planet. And the aliens are as intimidating as ever, although some of their majesty is lost since they're killed so often. And the ending is pretty awesome. The characterization has improved, too. It could have been better, but I had a greater idea on who Ripley was. I'm iffy on Newt - she doesn't add much to the story, but she does provide a contrast between Ripley and Newt and the xenomorphs.Aliens is far from a perfect action film. Even ignoring higher standards for art, some scenes destroy their own suspense. Sure, its pretty good. IMDb Top 250? I don't think so.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The machinery of narrative,"You simply cannot fail to study the Alien films. Individually, they range from great to below-average, but the journey and transformation of vision is fascinating and precious. It starts with Dune, the scrapped Jodorowsky version. The ambitious project collapsed, scattering the team of visionaries. In the meantime, Star Wars came out through the more business-savvy Spielberg-Lucas model and convinced execs that something like Dune can be done if you build with dedication from bankable parts instead of trusting genius.Alien was brilliant - all about the dissonance of different kinds of logic working in discovery of the same thing.This is something else entirely. The second explosion was that the Star Wars-Alien success was so immense, pieces of their mechanism rained all over Hollywood: new SFX worlds, ambition, coherent mythology. Several Scott-originated ideas for a second Alien were quickly proposed, most of them dumb (eventually retooled into Prometheus). Lucas had his own. Meanwhile, the Roger Corman factory was hard at work picking apart the films to build their own miniature models. The story goes that a young truck-driver, awestruck by Star Wars, decided to pursue screen writing, and naturally drifted to Corman's stable.Anyway, young Cameron got his break doing second unit work in the Alien-inspired Galaxy of Terror, which led to the Piranha gig. Long before any of us would know him as mogul and overambitious despot on set, the guy was a workhorse, a whiz-kid of DIY filmmaking. And he was getting hands-on practice right in the middle of an assembly-line where he had to puzzle about dressing and refitting all those spare parts. And you can again see all of that in the finished film here, only his second one.Nevermind the shift of tone from horror to action and war. We go from Scott's journey of dissonant discovery to one of efficiently getting a job done. From the shared adventure to uncharted space and new vision, to one woman's obsessive vision of something she knows and has to exterminate.As a result, you go from a film of multiple individually-perfected fabrics and different machinery, remember in Alien you went from Giger's biomechanoid alien ship, to the clean Kubrick-space of Mother's room, to the scrapyard maze of Nostromo's bowels, and different cameras for each space, to one man doing all, one fabric of camera and one practical logic throughout.There is no dissonant intrusion of alien- space and logic, like you had when injecting Moebius and Giger- fluid disharmony into Scott's clean vision. Both humans and aliens exist in the same workshop-space, and that blue-collar workspace of junk, papers and spare parts everywhere must have been the feel of the Corman factory of disassembling vision for study that Cameron intimately knew.And that emphasis on making something work shows in the creature itself (the product of vision) and the introduction of narrative for the encounter with it.In the original, you had the volatile omnipresence in shadows of something mysterious and ever-shifting that was not human at all, but an abstract being you understood had inscrutable biology and purpose. There was no narrative, we knew nothing about it.In Cameron's practical vision that's scaled down from near-metaphysical presence to a much more understood critter, understood both in terms of structure (beehive and presence of a Queen, Cameron-designed no less) and understood in terms of story, motherhood. Meanwhile Ripley herself in that outer space of unreason is slaying her own darkness.Those are not at all bad choices: clarity in both mechanics and narrative logic, practical purpose, no dissonance, efficient tension.It is just different to the original journey, less dangerous. It is a workingman's assembly-vision of what he does, building worlds. It works, he was extraordinarily competent with the parts. So competent in fact, that Spielberg himself had to sit down and take notice.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Good, but overrated and at times dated.","I enjoyed this film although I disagree with many who thought this was the best of the four. It doesn't touch the first. It may have been made 7 years after Alien but Aliens looks far more dated, probably due to the more frequent and more ambitious special effects. The aerial shots in particular look badly dated, I think that Cameron, unlike Scott bit off more than he could chew in terms of use of technology at the time. Alien has and will continue to stand the test of time.In addition the dialogue is poor and is made worse by one or two sub-standard performances, in particular Bill Paxton who was unconvincing in his nervous, worrying, ""what the f**K are we going to do"" soldier role. Though I enjoyed Paul Reiser & Lance Henriksen playing the roles of the menacing Hicks and the inhuman Bishop.Overall a good film, one of the few good sequel movies, though certainly not worthy of neither the 8.2 score on imdb or the #83 rated movie on imdb (at July 2003). 6.5/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"In my opinion, by far the best of the series","One of the problems of these is that each director, albeit to varying degrees, were selfish... not only adding their respective styles and touches to their separate efforts, each also tried to make theirs the definite piece(and little was left for the next director to work with). I won't claim that Cameron wasn't, as well... nor for a second deny that he by far had the best starting place(you'll know what I mean if you've watched the first, and perhaps also this... and if you haven't, you shouldn't find out from any other source)... but darn it if he doesn't live up to it and deliver the goods(not everyone manages to, no matter how solid the hand they're dealt is). Where the first has adequate atmosphere, this has it in spades. It had maybe three or four jump scares, this is continually exciting(this actually affected me far more often, and typically more lasting). This also has humor. It looks magnificent, technically and visually speaking. I'm afraid I just cannot claim that I see how Alien measures up to this. Effects are superior(how much better could they really have gotten in seven years? Besides, if you can't get something to look convincing on the screen, why are you putting it up there?). Characters are interesting and strong. The action is awesome, some of the best for the genres(I'm not kiddin'). Direction is effective all the way, and James just gets something much more satisfying, entertaining and engaging out of the title creature. This takes the next logical step in the franchise, and does so almost flawlessly. The plot is marvelous. Pacing is excellent, this is never boring(neither version). Acting is about spot-on(and frankly much more involving and involved than that of its predecessor, with Weaver, Henriksen(nailing his performance unbelievably well), Biehn(by far one of my favorite male actors, and when James Cameron directs him, it gets kicked up a notch of considerable size) and Henn(9 years old, and so talented) being just the top picks in a film which seems devoid of poor performances. Paxton provides perfect comic relief, without being goofy or lame. The sci-fi aspects of the film are also amazing(not to ignore what Alien did have, which should also be noted), and everything about the Marines is great, cool and obviously very thought through. The Special Edition holds about 17 minutes more material, and it's invariably worth the extra time. That cut also has a commentary track, and it is rather good... Bill and Michael are so fun to listen to, and their camaraderie comes off so genuine(though they do also all partake in the, one would presume, mandatory love-fest), Gale, Stan Winston and James have quite a bit to say... even Carrie, if she doesn't throw her two cents in as much, is a pleasant inclusion. All in all, the best of the series, and definitely the most intense(and perhaps scary) of them. I recommend it to fans of Cameron and/or of the Alien series. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""One of the Best Sequels Ever Made""...","... and there's a reason the summary headline is in quotations-- it gets thrown around a lot when referring to this film. Rightfully so.Perhaps what separates 'Aliens' from all of the other sequels that followed 1979s 'Alien' is that it has heart. Not only are we entrenched in the stark, gritty and imaginative future that Cameron has built for us- we are emotionally connected to it. And how's that so? Well, it is the product of much hard work and imagination. Whether you appreciate the sequel as much as the original or not, 'Alien' never attempts to copy or even ""outdo"" its predecessor. Instead, director James Cameron respects what Ridley Scott accomplished in the first film and takes it in a completely new direction while maintaining the dynamic presence of Weaver's Ripley as a key means of continuity.The characters are the heart of the film and the unfamiliar world in 'Aliens'. We even become attached to a android (who would have suspected that, especially after 'Alien'?). In just a few scenes, there is more humanity established in Michael Biehn's Cpl. Dwayne Hicks than in any other buff and brawn character in the future sequels.Another key factor to the films' greatness is its special effects, crafted by the (late, sadly) Stan Winston. I have a feeling that even years from now, moviegoers will still look back on this film as one of the greatest technical accomplishments in cinema's special effects history.As a adolescent boy, 'Aliens' was my favorite entry into the series. It was full of testosterone, centered in atmosphere, and riddled with some of the most imaginative and coolest characters and creatures ever placed on film. It still remains a favorite to this day.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Even better than its predecessor,"James Cameron is just a born genius in filmmaking, who always improves the sequel over the original film. ""Terminator 2"" is better than ""The Terminator"", and here ""Aliens"" exceeds ""Alien"". So there are reasons to expect that ""Avatar 2"" is upgraded from ""Avatar"".First of all, the visual effects are improved in ""Aliens"". In ""Alien"", due to the technology limits, only part of the alien is shown to the audience. But here in ""Aliens"", a full-sized alien is filmed. Secondly, the emotion of ""Aliens"" is stronger than that in ""Alien"" because of the new character Newt.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One Of The Greatest Sequels Of All Time..,"Aliens is rightly regarded by many as a classic and for good reason too. The film serves as a continuation of the story set up by Alien, but expands on that narrative, and features non stop action and horror. Directed by James Cameron this has his visual direction stamped all over it, and he really was in his prime in this period of time. The casting is perfection no weak performances with Sigourney Weaver giving an even better performance than in Alien. The marines have some recognisable faces with Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton among them with Paxton putting in a brilliant performance as a marine unravelling at the seams. The tension in the film is allowed to build up slowly allowing us to get to know the characters and then for the last 90 minutes it is all out action and war. Instantly quotable and suitably horrifying Aliens hits the mark in every way. This is a film i revisit a lot and for very good reason, it is a classic of its genre. Just don't ask me to pick my favourite film between Alien and Aliens.....",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Different Kind of Movie than Alien,"Alien was a groundbreaking, incredibly suspenseful thriller in which a small crew of ordinary people, including Ellen Ripley, attempted to survive and escape a terrifying creature. Aliens takes place in the same narrative universe, but involves taking the evil creature from the original film, multiplying it by a hundred or so, and shipping a hero-ified Ripley back to the forbidding planet with a group of space marines, including Bill Paxton playing a scared, rather dim-witted meathead as prone to toss out bad one-liners as he is to fire his rifle.In short, if you wish Alien had more, well, aliens, and way more explosions and gun battles, then Aliens is the film for you. It's an over-the-top action extravaganza. The movie starts veering into ridiculous territory as it approaches the conclusion, then it really cranks it up. It's preposterous, but it has a high ""cool factor."" After all, have you ever seen a front loader do karate before?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Much praised, but why?","Average imagination and average aims must be the combination behind this alien sequel. To take an example near the beginning, the capsules where the spaceship crew sleep are shot three times over from a very boring perspective (the foot of the beds slanted in a row to the left, the edge of the first bed slanted to the right); or, when part of the crew are investigating a tunnel where aliens might be hiding, the two men and a woman are pictured from the front, at the knee level, as in a tourist photograph.These ordinary camera angles would not matter, if the director was not only interested in technology but also people. But besides Sigourney Weaver's Ripley we have vehicles for one-liners. I just appreciate it if several people in a film are given some character: it does not have to be more complicated than, say, the four different old men in Clint Eastwood's ""Space Cowboys"" (2000). Also, I failed to notice any special amount of humour, which some say is there. Regrettably, Cameron's alien is just a competent action film, with good acting by Weaver.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best movie ever made. Period.,"There have got to be very few people left in the world who actually have'nt seen or been blown away by Aliens. If you are part of that really small minority, and really have to log on to the net and read reviews about this movie in order for you to decide whether to check it out or not, then you are a really sad person. Unless you're really young, you have missed the best movie ever made in entertainment history. I really hope that one has'nt been unlucky enough to have seen Alien-3, Alien resurrection or God forbid, AVP, before actually having seen Alien and Aliens for the first time. To maximize your enjoyment and understanding of Aliens, watch Alien-1 first and then go buy a home theater or locate a cinema hall where this is running and then only see it. While you can still watch it on DVD over and over again, a home theater or cinema would do the movie justice.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Awesome second installment  to Alien saga filled  with  tension , chills , noisy action and  groundbreaking scenes","Stirring and superior sequel with plenty of thrills , intrigue , suspense , disgusting special effects and lots of blood and gore . The planet from Alien I (1979) has been colonized, but contact is lost .

(William Hope) , being accompanied by Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) , a chief (Paul Reiser) of 'The Company' and again an android (Lance Henriksen) ; all of them go to the dangerous planet Alien . The rescue team has to confront an incredible power in a titanic fight .Nail-biting outing contains tension from start to finish , gory scenes aplenty , some strong scares , slime , emotion , entertainment and nice acting . This follow-up to Alien is also visually astounding , being masterfully realized by James Cameron with a good cast as Paul Reiser , Jenette Goldstein , Lance Henriksen , Michael Biehn , among others . All of the cast who were to play the Marines with the exception of Michael Biehn, who replaced James Remar one week into filming were trained by the S.A.S. , Special Air Service, Britain's elite special operations unit for two weeks before filming . Here Sigourney Weaver/Ripley stands out as one of the best action women of the cinema history . Sigourney Weaver's Best Actress Academy Award nomination for this movie was the first ever for an actress in an action role in an action movie . Moving and thrilling story by Walter Hill , David Giler and the same Cameron ; based on ""Alien"" characters created by Ronald Shusett and Dan O'Bannon . This exciting as well as heart-pounding movie contains shocks , stomach-churning violence , being packed with frenetic action , thrills and results to be pretty entertaining . It is a very good cinematic combination of Sci-Fi , monster movie and terror .

Magnificently designed creatures , originally created by the artist HR Giger . Top-notch special effects by SFX designer Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr . Although , only six alien suits were used, and even then they were mostly just a handful of latex appliances on black leotards , the appearance of hundreds of aliens is simply clever editing and planning, and lighting plus slime helped make the ""suits"" more solid.

The ending part is particularly exciting with our protagonist battling the malicious as well as brutal alien mother and with impressive scenes that took various months to film . The picture packs an enjoyable music score by maestro James Horner , full of fury and frightening sounds , though he cannibalized previous scores he had done, such as elements from his Star Trek II -wrath of Khan (1982) and Star Trek III (1984) scores . Furthermore , a colorful and adequate cinematography by Adrian Biddle . The motion picture lavishly produced by Gordon Carroll , David Giler , Walter Hill and Gale Anne Hurd was perfectly directed by the great James Cameron .There was seven years between the release of Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986), six between Aliens and Alien 3 (1992), and five between Alien³ and Alien resurrection (1997). The original and the best was ¨Alien¨ by Ridley Scott , it was starred by Sigourney Weaver as a great action woman similarly to Sanaa Lathan ; it is followed by this ¨Aliens¨, considered to be its better sequel .

Undeniably One of the Best Sci-fi Ever,"If you want to read praises on this film, there are many reviews here you can read. What I like to mention is how this film set the standard for other sci-fi and eventually created a subgenre of its own. Many overlooked the originality of this film, this was the first. Every idea, concept, in this film from the marines being overwhelmed by a horde of aliens to even the simple drop ship was original and would influence future sci-fi to come.One most obvious comparison is Starcraft, which borrowed many elements from this film. Some would even say that story aside, Starcraft was essentially Aliens the video game and they gone pro with various mutations and form. Movies like Edge of Tomorrow, The Tomorrow War, etc... are also heavily influenced by this film.This is what 80s/90s were all about; action, originality, entertainment, and none of the problems which plagued today's entertainment business. Anyone noticed Private Velasquez, praised for being a strong female minority character in the film, was played by Jenette Goldstein? She's actually Jewish who played John Connor's stepmother in Terminator 2. Yet nobody back then cared about that, they only cared she was an awesome character. Why? Because back then people weren't filled with the ""message"" of hate and division.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My mommy always said there were no monsters - no real ones - but there are.,"Ripley has been found in deep space by a salvage ship and brought back to a space station to be awoken from her 57 year sleep. Here she is mortified to find that the planet on which herself and her now deceased Nostromo crew found the Alien, LV-426, has been colonised by Weyland-Yutani Company. Suffice to say that when The Company representative, Burke, tells her that all contact is lost, she's not in the least bit surprised. Unable to get anyone to believe her about what happened to the Nostromo crew, Ripley is cajoled into going back to LV-426 with a crack team of space marines to seek, destroy or rescue...How do you make a sequel to one of the finest, most loved modern era films ever? This was something that director James Cameron must have pondered on many a dark night once he had agreed to make Aliens. The answer was to rightly not copy the format so brilliantly laid down by Ridley Scott and his team for Alien, but to embrace its mood and enhance it with thrills spills and exhilaration. This was only Cameron's third feature length movie, and here he was working with the crew who had made Scott's movie so special. Also writing as well as directing, this could have gone very wrong indeed, but Cameron rose to the challenge admirably and set up his marker on how his film would succeed. Keep the premise simple and seamlessly connected to Scott's film, and lets have more. Not just one bad ass acid bleeding alien, but an army of them, and their mother too!They mostly come at night - mowstly.Where Alien was a splicing of sci-fi wonderment and basic horror terrors, Aliens is a blend of war film staples to compliment both of those earlier picture things. Thus in keeping with Cameron's more is more work in progress skeleton. Another thing that Cameron instinctively called right was to make Aliens about Ripley (Sigorney Weaver simply brilliant), it's her story. Be it a parental thread or a feminist heroine fighting off the phallic hoards, cinema got in Ripley's extension one of its finest and strongest female characters ever (Weaver was nominated for Best Actress but lost out to Marlee Matlin for Children of a Lesser God).Thematically Aliens has been pored over in regards to metaphors about Vietnam, foreign policy and corporate greed at any cost, and rest assured that Aliens isn't merely one big excuse for a shoot them up bonanza. But realistically, and explaining why it was such a huge box office success, it's with the thrills and terror that Aliens most succeeds. The action scenes are slick and at times breath taking, and the tension is often palpable. None more so as we enter the film at the half way point, because here we realise that we have characters to care about. Blood, brains and brawn, all led by a heroine of considerable guile and guts. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Badass Movie, Worth the Watch, but Not As Good As the First One","Aliens is an excellent action-packed, sci-fi movie with standout performances by Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biene, and Lance Hendrickson, as well as a solid supporting cast of marines, most notably Bill Paxton.Cameron does an excellent job directing, as all three acts are perfectly constructed. Once the action gets going, it rarely lets up and will keep you on the edge of your seat. The aliens are so creepy and scary, and the movie has lots of horror elements. Some great scenes are maximized by stylish camera work and slow motion that really make it stand out.All in all, it's a great sci-fi movie, but a little bit of 80s cheesiness and a couple of parts that were a little bit dumb in the middle made it have a couple of flaws, which is the reduction in score. I still think part I is better, but this is well worth the watch, and for a sequel it is definitely up there among the best.8/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Highly overrated,"To balance the reviews, I have to call this movie highly overrated.Action and lines are highly cliché-like and many features are too unrealistic even for fiction.Take the motor vehicles (tractor like bulldozer-thing) with their noisy combustion engines. Surely we can expect something better in the distant future of Aliens.Or think about a marine on combat mission entering a potentially hostile environment on a planet in her bare skin. No protection gear. Reminds me of Iraq. (ed. Jan 2005).Communication equipment connected by cable? I mean, this is sci-fi, remember? Couldn't they at least have thought of wireless? We've had radios for a hundred years. Intercomm with cables??Besides the actions lingers on with no purpose for at least 70 minutes.Calling this a great film is simply crazy. At best it's a waste of good time.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"No, It Doesn't Match the Original, So Stop Pretending","Ridley Scott's superb Alien opens in a completely foreign atmosphere, making us want to be there, attracting us mysteriously. The camera moves around slowly and quietly, exploring this place, and it makes us want to be there. This is how he elusively draws us in and begins building suspense right under our noses. James Cameron's Aliens is too impatient. There is no build-up of suspense, there are constant close-ups, everybody's made up to look attractive, and the exposition is only long because it seems to think that extension equals suspense, or that there's some quota to fill and then you can play around with your big guns and gore all you want. Cameron presents us with an action film, big fun, special effects, blow this up, blow that up, but there is an hour and 45 minutes of waiting around for it, and less than an hour of action and violence. There is a good 20 minutes of nonstop action that is actually paced quite well and feels very intense, but it's aggravating to be kept from it for so long just so the film can appear as patient and effective as the original.The original Alien knew the magic of claustrophobia and the effect it can have. Cameron's nature is to do everything he can to outdo. So, he makes a bigger movie, with a bigger cast, and a bigger spaceship and bigger, louder scenes of violence, when that is not what you need to outdo the first Alien. There's nothing wrong with making the sequel more of an action film than a suspense film, but instead, he donned the film with the appearance of being patiently suspenseful and, since the film is about a big bunch of marines going to blow everything up and the film makes no attempt to be subtle, all we're doing is sitting and waiting, whereas in Ridley Scott's original, we were sitting bruising our dates' forearms.One thing I must add though, is that Jennette Goldstein should've become something bigger than she was. She is a fantastic actress, and extremely hot at that. She's the biggest highlight next to Bill Paxton here in Aliens, as she is to Paxton in Cameron's once wife Bigelow's Near Dark. She should've become a star.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Peak Action Movie Packed With Greatness,"As a fan since my early years, Aliens stands out as one of the action films from the '80s that remains on par with modern movies of the twenty-first century. After experiencing the first Alien film, I anticipated a continuation of its horror and suspense in Aliens. While it indeed maintains those aspects, it goes beyond with the perfect infusion of humor that balances out the intense action sequences.The action in Aliens is nothing short of flawless, with the effects team truly outdoing themselves. The aliens and the queen are rendered incredibly, and the cinematography of the action scenes amplifies the thrill factor to the max. Every moment on screen is a visual spectacle that keeps you at the edge of your seat.However, what truly sets Aliens apart is its unforgettable characters. Each one is memorable and terrific in their own right, making you genuinely care for them throughout the runtime. You fear for their safety every time the aliens attack, as the chemistry among the actors enhances the realism of their performances.Aliens is a movie that should be on the must-watch list for anyone who loves sci-fi or simply enjoys movies. Its gripping storytelling and engaging action will make two hours feel like a mere couple of minutes. From beginning to end, Aliens continues to captivate me, and it remains a film that I can rewatch endlessly and still be enthralled by its charm.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I Prefer the Extended Version,"James Cameron improves on the Ridley Scott film. This film is wall to wall action. It really shows how flawed ""Alien"" is.

"""Get away from her you bitch""","There are very few sequels out there that have managed to surpass the originals and overcome the expectations of the first chapter's loyal & faithful fans. And James Cameron's Aliens is one film that accomplishes exactly that by taking the universe of Ridley Scott's Alien and expanding upon it in ways most sequels are afraid to, for this second chapter is much bigger & more action-packed than its predecessor, and succeeds not only as a great sci-fi horror but as a redefinition of action filmmaking as well.The story of Aliens takes place 57 years after the events of the first film & concerns the solo survivor Ripley, whose account of what happened on the planet is dismissed by her executives as the very desolate planet is now inhabited by humans. Things are set in motion when the contact with the planet is lost & Ripley is requested to join a group of space marines to investigate, which she refuses at first but joins in eventually in order to face & overcome her fears once n for all.Written & directed by James Cameron, it's so heartwarming to see him expanding the universe of the previous film instead of crafting a loose sequel of Alien by repeating the same concept of the first film. Cameron in my opinion is an extremely talented filmmaker not because he knows what great action is all about but because he's always able to back it up with a highly compelling story which is further elevated by jaw-dropping visuals. And this film is a perfect testament to that.While Alien was a slow building masterpiece of atmospheric tension, Aliens replaces the survival horror of its predecessor with a highly intense, bombastic & violent war between two species. And even though there is less suspense in this film than the last chapter, Cameron makes up for it by turning his feature into an action- thriller filled with intense moments of relentless terror & highly potent combat sequences which ultimately culminates with a bone- chilling climax, that is executed to perfection.Coming to the performances, while Alien gave equal importance to each of its characters, Aliens places more emphasis on Ripley and is basically her journey from undergoing severe traumatic nightmares caused due to the events of the first film to facing her fears head on in this sequel. And Cameron has penned down her character with extreme care by providing Ripley more depth & emotional dimensions to explore, which Weaver makes full use of to deliver a career-best performance while also becoming the first real female action figure in cinema.The supporting cast is no slouch either as just like the previous film, there are almost no death fodders in this and the space marines are one bunch of badass characters, each nicely written & given a distinct personality. As for its technical achievements, the art direction & set designs may not have surpassed the artistic levels set in the previous film but it certainly comes close. Visual Effects however is groundbreaking, sound is expertly carried out and James Horner's score perfectly balances the tone of the film throughout the runtime.On an overall scale, James Cameron's Aliens is a wildly entertaining, immensely satisfying & one spectacular roller-coaster ride of non- stop action that refuses to age even after three decades and continues to rank amongst the most intense & fulfilling pieces of action extravaganzas ever made. Arguably the best film of the franchise, certainly one of the greatest sequels of all time, and undoubtedly one of the finest & most influential examples of its genre(s), Aliens is a perfect follow-up to Alien and, just like its predecessor, is immortal for its contribution to cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great action movie but disappointing as an Alien sequel,"After re-watching both Alien movies since twelve years ago0 I was surprised how much this movie aged compared to Alien. I have to add that my first contact with the Alien franchise was in fact Aliens and I always loved it in the past. As a matter of fact I used to love both movies equally, never holding one in higher regard, since both are different genre films.But ever since revisiting both films, I noticed that the devil is in the detail. Which isn't to say that there aren't any positive things about Aliens, the movie is in itself an achievement with the limited budget and means for the time, it has outstanding practical effects. I also liked the themes of motherhood as a continuation of the 'birth' themes from the first movie.Unfortunately some stuff did not age so well.Let's begin with the dialogue: the dialogue in this movie is very, very cheesy. And although most of the soldiers are well established for their minimal screen time, they are like cartoon characters compared to the tone of the first movie. The Nostromo crew and their banter felt very authentic and is one of the main reasons why the movie feels so relatable although it takes place in a distant time in outer space. Especially a character like Hicks shouldn't be such a blank slate.There's also something very unique about the first Alien movie that none of the sequels (except maybe Alien3) bothered to include and that is the weird sexual undertones. No other sci-fi movie before mixed horror and sexual imagery in a very disturbing way. Not only was it inherent in the designs by HR Giger. But there were horrific scenes like the death of Lambert which was disturbing in the way it was sexually hinted at. Since this is an American movie the sexuality got replaced by fetishism of weapons and guns.The other thing where the movie missed it's mark is the designs of the Alien drones. None of the sequels ran with the original idea of HR Giger to create a bio-mechanical-hybrid creature that no one quite understands. Instead we're introduced to the trend of making the creature more slimy, organic and animal-like. It's baffling how all the sequels (including AvP) dropped the ball on this. Bigger is not always better and although the Alien Queen is beautifully designed, it's shown too often. I get that Stan Winston wanted to showcase his work, but I feel like less would have been more.The cinematography of this film is solid but never reaches the peaks of the first movie. Just compare the great waking up sequence of the crew in the first film with the one in the sequel. They are worlds apart. The other thing is music. The score of the discovery of the alien ship is one of the most haunting scores in cinema history. Whereas Michael Horner delivers a strong orchestral score which is of course more bombastic but also very traditional.I don't want to crap too much on this sequel since it's still one of the better sequels to come out of this franchise. But unfortunately it didn't hold up as well as I wanted it to be.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Going bigger and slightly better, Cameron's ""Alien"" sequel pulls off everything it attempts.","There is a moment about half way through James Cameron's ""Aliens"" which seems to very deliberately turn back to its 1979 predecessor and say 'yeah, I see your effort, and I raise you'. It occurs when a bevy of soldiers are trooping through the remains of a settlement on a desolate moon: it has been ransacked by a series of violent creatures whose sole purpose is to seemingly seek organisms and attack them. As they march through the crime scene, we realise that they are essentially traversing an area which has seen events play out that were very similar to the first film: a group of (largely) unarmed people trying to defend themselves from these animals in a zone they cannot escape. ""Aliens"", however, is just getting out of second gear by this point...Cameron's film somehow manages to go bigger and, dare I say it, a bit better than ""Alien"" - marrying the genres of action; horror and science-fiction to excellent effect. Indeed, like the best of anything science-fiction has to offer, you get the feeling you are in another world - a world of superior artificial intelligence, of space vehicles designed for things we are still a long way from pioneering ourselves and of distant worlds.The terror Cameron seems able to inject into proceedings stems, I think, from knowing there are multiple enemies; indeed, an endless supply, about whom we know very little but always seem to be conniving to get you one way or another. One would think lots of these creatures dumped into a film alongside a group of gun-toting protagonists would make for a disaster after the menacing calm of the first film - perhaps I once thought that myself, but having seen the film again recently, I'm of the opinion that Cameron executes the material really well.""Aliens"" begins with a military-style drum roll over the opening credits, briefly foreshadowing the militaristic content this edition will possess. We pick up, quite literally, where the first film ended: the lone human survivor of the transport ship Nostromo, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), is drifting through space in an escape capsule. When she is found, a rare and amusing moment occurs: an outside agent, totally unaware of what they have stumbled upon, crack open the door and send in a probe to make sure it's safe - they are afraid of what we know is perfectly fine, and yet we as an audience are unsure of what has found our heroine and so are oddly uneasy as well.When Ripley comes around, the film allows us to share in her shock at the fact some 57 years have passed since the events of the first film. She has lost a daughter who has outlived her and, gut-wrenchingly, entire families have since settled on the moon the initial alien's biological origins were discovered. Her only friend amidst a sea of disapproving bureaucrats, unsympathetic to her story, is a smooth-talking company employee named Burke (Paul Riser), whose pleasant manner makes certain later reveals all that more surprising...Burke wants Ripley to traverse to the moon when, inexplicably, communications with the settlement suddenly cease, only he wants her to accompany a platoon of marines, as she has first-hand experience of the creature and nobody can take any chances... What Cameron does impressively here is he allows for the opening act to calmly break us into this sequel, which is at once both very similar to ""Alien"" but very different: loose ends are tied up, Ripley becomes grounded again; we sneak a glimpse of mugshots of the first crew on a monitor; she accepts her daughter's death and even reconciles with the cat of the first film.Once Cameron senses we are ready to roll, act two arrives, and the film begins to play games: the marines themselves strike us as unprofessional in their messing around and cracking crude jokes. They are not especially well-drilled - one of them even seems to echo the dialogue of the doomed crew of the first when they speak about not being paid enough; the commander confuses two marines, Hudson (Michael Biehn) and Hicks (Bill Paxton), and we are afforded a shot of Ripley looking on in horror at her escorts.When the time comes, of course the film breaks out into action - armed soldiers versus a nest of beasts when it's discovered a process similar to what befell John Hurt in ""Alien"" occurred to an unwitting inhabitant of the colony. But, without question, the film is more than merely two hours of blazing guns and wretched shootouts - there is variety to the set pieces and they're executed really well: pulsating gunfights in rooms drowned in red light give way to retreats into ventilation shafts; there is a dramatic confrontation in the cargo bay of a giant spaceship, which refuses to end when it spills into the airlock. Midway through, Ripley is trapped in a small bunkroom with a crawling specimen eager to attach itself to her face where every little rattle and clank is unnerving. What additionally struck me was just how difficult it was to predict who was safe and who wasn't.Moreover, the film is a poised character study of Ripley negating this new nightmare with an infant girl called Newt (Carrie Henn), orphaned by the monsters, and allowing Weaver's character a kind of second chance at good mothering. She may have failed to live up to the promise she made to the daughter we find out about, but damned if she's going to fail to get Newt out of this jam. The arc is eventually afforded closure as Ripley and an alien queen, responsible for the eggs from which the aliens essentially harbour their existences, confront one another and we remember it was one of the queen's own offspring which ultimately took Ripley's time with her own little girl away from her. ""Aliens"" is a taut, well-made sequel and well worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very overrated,"Aliens is, by all accounts, a very solid and effective sci-fi epic. James Cameron shifted the horror/sci-fi blend of the 1979 original towards a more action/adventure oriented film, and as such, it works: The action scenes are good all around. But as a follow-up to one of the finest sci-fi films ever made, it fell short for me, and the constant referring to it as the best film in the series is, in my opinion, heavily unjustified. Even if taken at face-value as an action movie, it doesn't have a lot of substance on top of the action, and unlike Cameron's Terminator films it's often lacking in structure, pacing and especially in self-awareness of any kind - Aliens is dead and dull serious all the time.And when compared to the first movie, a champion of tension and atmosphere, Aliens is almost constantly predictable, and failed to get me into any state of real suspense. Also, while Alien was filled to the brim by a cast of first rate character actors - John Hurt, Harry Dean Stanton, Ian Holm, Tom Skerritt - which made every death a shocking moment, the cast of Aliens, except for Sigourney Weaver's admittedly excellent performance (though I preferred her scared survivor in Alien over her kick-ass action girl in Aliens), is pretty dull. Lance Henriksen is good in his few brief scenes as Bishop, but Michael Biehn is as unimpressive as ever, Carrie Henn doesn't get any real sympathy, and as for Paul Reiser - his cookie-cutter evil-corporate-shell character is as dull as his perfect clone, Giovanni Ribisi's character in Avatar.I may have overstated the movie's faults - it's not, by any means, a bad one, but for those reasons (mainly) I can't consider it one of my favorites, while Ridley Scott's original is. Interesting to note that many of those reasons are the same that make me dislike all other James Cameron movies, all of which are, with the exception of T2, unbelievably and ridiculously overrated.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not bad for a... human (made film),"If you're into sci-fi then you should have seen Aliens by now. It's the - not particularly imaginatively - titled sequel to the 1979 'haunted house is space' film Alien. And, depending on how you like your science fiction, will determine exactly which of the two you'll like the best (it's worth noting that whichever one you pick, you'll probably agree that they're both up there with the best science fiction films ever made).Alien is dark, quiet and moody. Its successor is loud, brash and big as it follows the sole survivor of the first film, Ellen Ripley, as she returns to Earth after floating in space for 57 years, only to find that the planet where she first encountered the xenomorph has been colonised. Then - guess what - all contact is lost with colony and she has to accompany a team of space marines in a rescue mission (that does not go well).Sigourney Weaver was nominated for an Oscar for her performance. However, it's hard to pick out a stand-out performance here. It's rare in a movie when you know that half of the cast are going to end up on the wrong end of a monster's teeth to really care about them. Yet, here you find yourself rooting for even the lowliest of cast members.The best part of Aliens (just like Star Wars) is that it's 'timeless.' We're now nearly thirty years on from its creation and yet it still looks as good. The special effects (and general atmosphere) beat anything made today and current films could really take a lead out of its book when it comes to using miniature models over excessive CGI.If you haven't seen Aliens, you should. Normally I would recommend it for fans of the action/sci-fi/horror genres. However, this is a film that defined the genre and has been copied (poorly) to this day (think the Resident Evil films to name but a few). Therefore, I truly believe people that don't always want to watch horror may ever enjoy it (maybe not as much as me, but I think most will appreciate that this is a behemoth in modern film history and should at least be respected, if not adored as much as I do).And remember... there's something moving in here and it ain't us!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best action sci-fi horror war movie my number 1 personal favorite film of all time hands down,"Aliens (1986) is a masterpiece one of the best action sci-fi horror war films of all time hands down. I love this movie to death it is my personal number 1 best action sci-fi-horror movie that I love to death. In my opinion this is James Cameron best film ever don't get me wrong I love The Terminator, I love Terminator 2: Judgment Day to death, they are both my personal favorite James Cameron films because Cameron is a legend I appreciate him. The same time my personal favorite films of all time will always be Aliens and Rambo: First Blood Part II because James Cameron wrote the script for it. It is a bad-ass film and I wrote a war because this time is war in the planet LV-426 Platoon of US Space Marines fights against Aliens.I know a lot of people compere this film to an action and sci-fi genre but doesn't compare to horror genre. There's plenty of horror in it: the opening scene the dreams sequence in which Ripley has a nightmare and we see Ripley been cocooned from one of those Alien creatures in her stomach that was scary sequence in which her cat Jones start hissing and creeps me out every time I see it. The creepy atmosphere of the LV-426 colony, and the heart pounding face hugger on the loose scene in the medical bay that is horror sequence.I love James Horner's music score for the movie which is his best soundtrack ever, who is no longer with us anymore. R.I.P. you are missed.I love all the characters: Ripley, Newt than the marines: Corporal Dwayne Hicks, Bishop, Private Hudson, Lieutenant Gorman, Private Vasquez, Sergeant Apone, Private Drake, Private Frost, Corporal Ferro, Private Spunkmeyer, Corporal Dietrich, Private Crowe, and Private Wierzbowski I love them all in this movie and they are memorable.Sigourney Weaver returns as Ellen Ripley, who travels with a platoon of US Colonial Marines to investigate a loss of contact with the colony established on the same planet discovered by the crew of the Nostromo in the original filmI love the action, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) finds the Alien nest, saves Newt (Carrie Henn) destroys all the eggs of the Alien. Battles with the Alien Queen one-on-one she gains a new daughter, when her real daughter was dead. Ripley comes back to colony LV-426 to face her fear once and for all so that she want have any nightmares and she and Newt will be safe. We have Bishop here a synesthetic android, he saves Ripley and Newt. Lance Henriksen is excellent as Bishop I love him in Hard Target (1993) and I love him in here to death.I love Michael Biehn as Corporal Dwayne Hicks this is my favorite role of the actor he played. I love Private Hudson (Bill Paxton) he was the best, rest in peace I really miss you. Ellen Ripley is a bad-ass warrior Sigourney Weaver was the best in this movie. Carrie Henn as Newt was the heart in this film.I love this film to death, I am cherishing with all my heart. I have this movie on Blu-ray disc and I am constantly watching it. I used to had the DVD version but I trade it for Blu-ray because of the better picture quality, better special features and the DVD cut scenes from the film away even the special edition did that. DVD did not had any special features at all. 10/10 my personal action, sci-fi, horror masterpiece war movie of all time I love ""Aliens"" to death!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
By Far The Best Movie In The Franchise,"I remember having a conversation with a work colleague in 1983 on horror films ( In those days video nasties like I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE and NIGHT OF THE DEMON were all the rage ) and he mentioned that he thought ALIEN was a great film . "" Hmm "" I replied "" I didn`t think it was that good Benny . It would have been better if there was more people getting killed by lots of aliens and a lot more action "" It could be that James Cameron over heard my conversation and decided he was going to make a sequel solely to please me , but it`s more logical to assume that he recognised the obvious faults of the pretentious arthouse original and went for a no holds action blockbusterI really loved the action setpieces of ALIENS , the flames , the explosions , the gunfire , the high body count and the nerve jangling tension . Cameron does a great job and unlike his later films never goes overboard on the production values and a special mention should go to realistic little things like costume design . All too often directors shoot themselves in the foot by making the future look futuristic and fail because of it , check out UFO , THE GREEN SLIME and SPECE 1999  for a few examples , but here the costumes look very functional as opposed to futuristic . And Cameron has written a very good - though possibly overlong - script . Notice that it has - Unlike his script for RAMBO FIRST BLOOD PART TWO - a slightly left of centre viewpoint with the marines being jingoistic American stereotypes and the bad guy being a corperate capitilist ? This no accident on the part of the screenwriter I`m sureSo with a few rare exceptions like MAD MAX 2 this is a film that outdoes the original . I know that some critics prefer Ridley Scott`s version and they`re entitled to their veiwpoint but Cameron proved the doom mongers ( And there was a lot of them in 1985 )  wrong when they announced that ALIENS wouldn`t come close to equalling never mind surpassing the original .I`ve no idea what Benny thought of ALIENS  though",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Different from the Original (and one of the best sequels in existence),"This time its James Cameron who is charged with bringing the alien to the screen, an entirely different approach is used and it has to be said that this sequel is not as scary as the original, however it is slightly better (probably because it was made 7 years later and visual effects were much improved).This time we get to see the alien in all its glory and the frights are due to the sheer number of them terrorising the heavily armed soldiers intent on destroying them.This is definitely less of a horror film and more of an action movie. I think the reason that it works so well is that everyone was is ready to see the aliens in all there terrifying splendour, and had the sequel tried to recreate the suspense of the original would undoubtedly have failed.Sci-Fi action at it's very best 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A miracle,"Yes, indeed a miracle. This is one of the few movies that follows up and changes the formula of an excellent film and doesn't loose anything at all in quality, relative to its genre. In a very clever way, this movie transports the universe from the sci-fi epic ""alien"" into an action movie that is probably the best of its type. James Cameron shows great talent while directing this film, always keeping connections to the Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" so that the idea of sequel isn't broken despite the great difference between the films. The acting is good, and excellent in the case of Sigourney Weaver (however, how polemic this may sound, I think she's even better in Alien 3). The plot is very simple like in the first movie, but as the few twists come it becomes quite convencing. The special effects are quite good for its time showing a clear improvement from the first movie. The alien queen is quite impressing. The action sequences are memorable and have inspired many ""imitations"" in other movies and even in some video games. This film only receives a worst score than the first because if we put aside the different genres, the movie itself is quite worst than the first, it is in the action genre that it is great.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Sequel That Flips Genres,"""Aliens"" retains the story, setting, and characters of the original 1979 classic ""Alien"" and discards most of the rest. Gone are the atmosphere, the mundane life aboard a freighting vessel, and the claustrophobia. According to conventional wisdom, abandoning the elements that make a classic so amazing is a terrible idea. But ""Aliens"" is able to crank everything up to eleven and blast open the airlock in terms of crafting a well-rounded sequel. It does what very few sequels attempt to do: don't rehash the original and just ""play it safe."" And it does what very few of what those very few attempts succeed in accomplishing: stand on its own two feet and stand on a pillar alongside its older sibling as one of the pinnacle films of their respective genres (horror and action).Sigourney Weaver is even better in this film as her iconic role, Ripley. I love almost all of the supporting cast, they are all memorable. I especially found Bill Paxton's Hudson hilarious and charming with his one liners.Great action direction from James Cameron; this movie is up there with his two ""Terminator"" films as the perfect mixture of Hitchcock-ian suspense with testosterone induced mania.I would argue that this film, in many aspects, is able perhaps even overshadow its original (at least in terms of having a fun popcorn crowd-pleasing effect on the cultural zeitgeist). Many video games such as ""Doom"" and ""Halo"" take near direct influence from the aesthetic and story beats of this film. You owe it to yourself to watch this movie and just sit back and have fun with it.One word: awesome.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"While Alien perfected slow-building, atmospheric tension, Aliens packs more of a punch, and features what I think is Sigourney Weaver's best performance.","Everyone says that sequels have a tendency to suck. Then there are the sequels that do not improve upon the original, but are still good movies on their own. Then there is Aliens. A sequel that is not like other sequels. Aliens is one of those sequels that is either as good as or better than the original. The film continues Ripley's story arc at exactly where the first one left off. Ripley has been floating around in stasis for 57 years. When she returns home, her employer, the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, asks her what happened. Ripley tells them the entire story which none of them believe. She is also suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Ripley is told that there are now colonists on the planet LV-426 which is the crew she served with found the ship from the first film. Burke, a high level representative from the company, tells Ripley that communication with the colony has stopped and convinces her to return there with marines and be an adviser. Unfortunately when they get there, the colony is destroyed and the colonists are nowhere to be found except for one survivor, a little girl named Newt. They find out that the colonists did discover the ship and everything that happened on the Nostromo is now repeating itself in the colony. This sequel was directed by Terminator director James Cameron, not Ridley Scott. But it still does not matter as Aliens has a lot of what made the first film great. H.R. Giger's designs from the first film are improved upon. That goes more than double with one of the aliens late in the film. The marines in this movie are armed with state of the weapons that can easily kill, but the film keeps all of the tension by having them completely outnumbered and at a disadvantage with them not knowing what they are up against, despite Ripley telling them earlier in the film. While there are the dumb marines, Hicks, Vasquez, and Hudson either leave a lasting impression or remain quotable. Newt is not your typical kid character. Most kid characters in films get annoying, however Newt is a lot fun to watch. She is also smart and realizes that the best way to survive against the aliens is to run. The acting in the film is also impressive. Sigourney Weaver returns as Ripley and owns the role so much that it is likely the best performance she has ever given. Hicks, Hudson, and an android named Bishop are all played by Cameron film regulars Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, and Lance Henriksen. All three of them suit their roles very well. Aliens is another one of those movies that ages so well over time. It probably gets better and better with each viewing. While Alien perfected slow-building, atmospheric tension, Aliens packs more of a punch, and features what I think is Sigourney Weaver's best performance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Mind-blowing,"This is the second movie of the legendary Alien series. The movie weighs more on the action side rather than suspense as in the first movie. It was a very clever move as the expectations were high. The cast is enlarged with interesting characters and Sigourney Weaver keeps the lead role as usual. The movie involves a lot of stunning action sequences with different kinds of horrific creatures, all taken without the use of CGI.It has numerous unforgettable scenes such as the fabulous knife trick of Bishop, huge Alien Queen laying eggs and Bishop getting ripped in half. When we were children, the day after seeing the movie, we used to imitate the knife trick with pencils at school.The movie is still mind-blowing 35 years later.

Sigourney Weaver: the bad-ass,"Most people have probably heard how the second one continues the story but takes a little bit different direction: the first one was a horror movie and the second one was more of an action flick. Well, you'd better believe that they go all out. The story picks up fifty-seven years after the original, and sure enough, there are more aliens. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), however, is not to be deterred. If those drooling fiends are around, she's ready to take them on.I should say that the movie seems a little silly at times. Since this is an action flick, there are a number of army types, and they all have their macho lingo. Fortunately, ""Aliens"" doesn't pretend to be anything but an action flick. If anything, the little girl adds a sort of humanizing aspect to the kick-ass stuff. But this is definitely a guy movie, albeit one carried by a woman. If I may say so, Weaver becomes as much of a bad-ass here as she was in ""Ghost Busters"" (of course, this time she's not possessed).Anyway, this movie has something for everyone, and you're sure to like it.

Perhaps The Best Sequel,Aliens is perhaps the arguably the best sequel.

While the previous was a sci-fi horror with one monster killing off members of ship this was a sci-fi action with Earth's toughest taking the fight to a colony of xenomorphs. Its intelligently done and though it's a bit long at a 137 minutes each of those is time well used in this action packed adventure-thriller. Aliens joins the ranks of many great movies with the fact that it breaks genres it combines so many different aspects into this one complete film. Of course the star of the film is Sigourney Weaver as Ripley but Michael Biehn is something of a co-lead for the better part of this film and he delivers.

Game over man?,"Well many would strongly disagree.

Bill Paxton has done a lot of movies and he has shown his skills in many roles. This may be the favorite for some, but he is not alone.And the Alien is also not alone (see what I did there?). That's another reason this sequel is named Aliens (as in more than one). Now apparently Weaver came back to this franchise having some thoughts of her own. None of which where implemented by Cameron, but were later taken not just under consideration but made into ""reality"".But back to this, that has a lot of Aliens and a lot of weapons. Weaver herself is anti gun, but as Cameron stated, it is not Weaver shooting, it is Ripley, her character. So this is way more action packed and it also continues the story of the first movie.

This is by far the best,"What can I say, this is by far the best Sci-Fi / horror movie and one of the best sequels of all time. Ripley interaction with Hicks and Newt was both refreshing and believable. You know when you have a winner when you care what happens to the characters. Another testament to its greatness is the end of the movie that started with a cliff hanger and left you wanting more.

It's not all about action.,"Cameron's Aliens is a completely different beast to Ridey Scott's original film. Those who tout Cameron's sequel as a better film are missing the point. From a gung-ho, blockbuster point of view, yes, Cameron's film is audacious, thrilling, brilliant.The original film was a sublimely intellectual exploration into the abject horror of psycho-sexual not-human monstrousness. It reached a level of horror and monstrousness that is not, not could be, matched by Cameron's film.Luckily, he is clever enough to realise this. The point of the original Alien film is that the creature is entirely semblant and lacks definition; culturally as well as thematically. By the time Cameron's sequel was released, the creature became absorbed into popular culture and to present it once again as the unknown would have been a failure. This is why Alien 3 failed. It is a rehash of Alien, and while it contains the obligatory horror film shocks and schlock content, it lacks the terrible subconscious entry into the human body that the alien signifies, and was not successfully picked up until, somewhat surprisingly, Alien Resurrection.So, Cameron's film is a big, muscular blockbuster, whose contribution to the series is to expand the alien canon through the introduction of the Queen - still one of the greatest screen 'villians' ever - and the theme of motherhood in a very different way to the original film through the character of Newt.I love this film; its big muscular Marines with their big guns and black humour never outgrow or undermine the subtle horror flourishes of the alien universe, but their camaraderie and arrogance makes their fallibility all the more inevitable. And with the use of the character Carter Burke, we are left thinking, like Ripley, which species is worse.It's a fantastic sequel, and one of the greatest science fiction action horrors of all time, but it's not better than Alien (and that doesn't mean it's not as good...)!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One Alien was bad enough,"The first movie was extremely good, then I heard that the sequel was almost just as good or even better. In the first movie, there was one alien, in the next one: there is hundreds of them. I had no idea how Aliens was better than Alien, because I don't think that many sequels become this good. Well, I had no idea how the second Godfather would be so good when I thought the first one was good enough. I write books and I already said to myself I will not make any sequels for my books because most sequels never turn out to be better than the first. I clearly underestimated how good this movie would, it was much better than I expected, same with the Godfather Part II. I am now in love with the first and second Alien movies. Good title, they don't call the movie: Alien 2, just Aliens meaning more than one. In my opinion Ripley is the best female ass kicker in all of movies. The acting is very good in this movie, the special effects are very good, intense action, scary, and extremely powerful. In my opinion the second best Sci-fi sequel behind The Empire Strikes Back.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Wow, a Sci-Fi movie that doesn't feel dated after 20 years","You have to know about me that I'm a big movie buff, but that I'm not a fan of most Sci-Fi movies. It's just not my kind of movie. Most of the time they just aren't good enough and aren't able to make me believe the story. But the Alien-movies are something different. Somehow they are able to get my attention and to keep me focused from the beginning until the end.Aliens is the second movie in the series and the story starts half a century later. Ripley, the only survivor from the previous movie, has been found by a salvage ship, adrift in the shuttle she used to escape, in a deep sleep. She's taken back to Earth, where she hears that a colony was established on the planet where the Alien once was found. But since a while, all contact with the planet has been lost and a rescue mission, coordinated by the Space Marines, will be sent to see what has happened. Ripley is asked to join them as their 'advisor' and so she will meet her biggest fear ... again.Even though it is still my opinion that sequels should be forbidden, since most of them are only intended to get even more money out of the pockets of the fans, I'll have to review my opinion for once. This movie certainly isn't as bad as most sequels are. It's still full of action, the acting is good and let's be honest, a Sci-Fi movie that doesn't look dated after 20 years time is something special. That's why I give this one a 7/10. Certainly worth a watch",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best there is!!,"Of all the sci-fi films I've seen, this is undoubtedly the BEST sci-fi action film out there. With a mix of suspense, action, humor, love, horror....this film tops them all.

Hollywood needs to know that sometimes, CGI doesn't make monsters look better, let alone action. The most important aspect of this film is its dynamic storyline. It starts out with a futuristic world, then comes down to the dark and gloomy techy hallways of doom with which the Aliens lurk. Nothing tops that!

State-of-the-art sci-fi,"An American horror thriller and sci-fi; A story about a commercial space tug officer who joins a crew of battle-hardened marines to investigate an incident on an exomoon, but they find they are no match for what lies in wait for them. Essentially, it is a combat picture set in the future. It is visceral and has plenty of energy, successfully manipulating the audience through protracted scenes of claustrophia and then steadily building the tension that culminates in unremitting tension in the finale. As a film sequel, it could not replicate the novelty of the first film, but the marvellous craftsmanship adds a new form of distraction: better staging, better special effects, and better props, which confirm a graphic power.

My Favorite Film,"I was introduced to ALIENS, somewhat forcibly, by a film-wise friend in 1987; she plonked me down with a strong drink, cued the videotape, chuckled, and said something like, ""Trust me.""12 years and 2 film sequels later, I'm still in her debt: the film rose to the top of my ""Fave Film"" list in '94 and hasn't dropped. With all the films ever made, between 1200-1400 of which I've experienced, why ""Aliens""?1) I rarely had to suspend my disbelief, remarkable with an SF film. This could be the future; this all could happen, I felt, except for the compression of events between the initiation of the destruct sequence [for planet LV-47] and it's completion. Cameron challenged my credibility there, but hardly anywhere else.2) Humans repel advanced, mightier, hostile species, despite Corporate greed, arrogance & fuggheadedness (Carter Burke and Ripley's review committee) and Military arrogance, fuggheadedness & incompetence (Lt. Gorman, and to a lesser extent Hudson, Apone, Drake, etc.). The heroes/victors?: 2 adult females (1 survivor), 1 juvenile female, 1 synthetic person and 1 adult male. Hard to get more egalitarian than that.3) Crisp, believable, memorable, quotable script--a rarity and a joy in any film since the lion's share of a major film's budget went, not to the actors, but to the pre- and post-production crew (as well as the crew off-camera during filming).4) Cameron's depth of research and ""world-building"" for this (and a few other) films is almost as impressive as John Tolkien's for Middle Earth. Where Ridley Scott sketched out a series of events, James Cameron built a time and place that could have thousands of plausible, interesting stories.5) Cast selection, and subsequent character building, rival and perhaps top (ironically) Ridley Scott's ""Bladerunner"".I echo many of the feelings and opinions other reviewers here have already written, so won't repeat them, except: I have never yet seen Aliens and felt that I'd seen it one too many times. This film's superior has not yet been created; everyone involved in bringing it to the screen should be proud to have worked on a dramatic Science Fiction-cum-Thriller-cum-Action film masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

When the movie does kicks of it introduces a lot more characters than the first and In my opinion a lot more interesting and fun characters. The movie also introduces something that strongly relates to ripleys character and therefore creates a tense and interesting development as the story goes. It's really hard to review this movie without spoilers.

Simply Perfect,"Twelve years ago, James Cameron made the ultimate sci-fi movie ever created. At first, it was thought that either it would be a bomb and ruin his career or be a box office hit and all the credit would go to Ridley Scott (Alien). Both speculations were wrong.  In 1986, Cameron made the most amazing Sci-Fi movie imaginable.  Adding all the aspects of a thick plot, action, suspense, terror, and realism any movie could possibly handle.  The acting was perfect as was the special effect.  At a budget of $18 million, Aliens beats even today's visual masterpieces.  After years of watching Aliens, I was able to watch the special edition and saw the sentry gun scenes as well as the colony scenes, making the movie a whole 2 hours 34 minutes long.

"The Best of the ""Alien"" Series","As good as the original is, ""Aliens"" is still the best of the popular series.  James Cameron's in-your-face direction creates edge-of-your-seat chills and thrills that will leave you shaken well after the film's final act.  Sigourney Weaver (Oscar-nominated) does some of the best work of her career.  This is definitely her show as she adds a new dimension to the film.  A group of space marines are assembled to find out what has happened on planet LV-426 (the planet from the original) after Earth loses contact with its inhabitants.  Weaver knows what has happened and warns the group of soldiers.  However, it takes an all-out assault by the title characters to convince the remainder of the crew that they are against an unbeatable foe. The screenplay is just smart enough to work and the supporting characters are great as well.  Lance Henriksen, Paul Reiser, Michael Biehn, and Bill Paxton stand out the most among the rest of the cast.  Although the film is very different from the original, its style makes it an incredible experience which is unforgettable.  A great addition to the action, sci-fi, and horror genres.  4.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The visual effects are still very good due to the huge amount of money that was poured into making the film, but it's the seriously bad acting and tacky storyline that let it down.Compared to the first film which was a very good and atmospheric horror, this is more like a typical cheesy action film, with lots of flashy special effects to try and keep audiences amused.

The plot and acting at times are cartoonish and outlandish, but as a teen when first seeing it, was a plus. Once they're killed off, it's Ripley/Weaver in her element. The technological aspects were very visionary at the time, when we had Commodore 64s or such. The only aspect that 'is showing some wear' was the flight of the spacecraft against the clouds...a mildly dated, toylike but still quite good.

The worst Alien?!,"After watching every single alien movie from the first to the 2024 abomination, this one is my least favorite after the first. It's entirely too long with a ridiculous plot full of horrible decisions no military personnel would make. Everyone outside of Sigourney Weaver was so over the top with their so called acting that it was a funny comedy rather than a horror. I love and miss Bill Paxton terribly, but this was a complete waste for him as a character and not remotely believable. Ripley may be the worst consultant in existence with the lack of information she gives these so called Marines. Plot holes aside, the little girl was wooden and not too likeable. It seemed odd Ripley would care more about going back for her than the people she came with, but not much makes sense in this movie. It's just drawn out for the sake of it. I actually felt bad for the queen alien at the end for how Ripley treated her and I wanted the aliens to win. They seemed to have more empathy and intelligence than most of the humans. James Cameron shouldn't have been allowed to make another movie after this, the man can't direct proper dialogue. Titanic was a fluke.

An absolute reference in all categories,"James Cameron gave free rein to his abundant imagination, his sense of rhythm and his talent as a narrator to lay us a pure and infinitely inventive action-oriented Alien, in total complementarity with the first one by Ridley Scott. Aliens makes a lasting impression on me with each vision.Cameron lands overtrained soldiers on a planet of settlers decimated by the Aliens (who reproduce at breakneck speed). The soldiers are there to ""eat"" the beasts and the deployment of high-tech weapons is enjoyable. Cameron considerably enriches this SF universe with many futuristic objects (the lifting robot, the steady-cam, the motion detector). We also discover the reproduction mode of the Aliens and the formation of cocoons.In the unrated version, the film takes on its full extent and offers Ripley a capacity rarely achieved. She fights to protect this orphan taken in, like a mother. Her confrontation with the Queen Mother Alien is fearsome, heartbreaking, and represents a metaphor for the maternal survival instinct.Visually stunning, Aliens culminates in a final 25 minutes of unparalleled space freaking.

in space no one hears you scream except the audience!,"let me begin by saying that this film is magnificent. Working from a 26 million dollar (US) budget and a relatively unknown cast aside from Ms. Weaver, James Cameron broke the mold and blew the lid off of sci-fi action films with this one.The first Alien was a miracle unto itself. After slyly reversing the lead roles and creating a heroine with Sigourney's Ripley, Scott masterminded a haunted house in outer space that broke taboos aplenty in the seventies. Learning that the cast including veronica cartwright and everyone else were not privy to what was going to happen during the first chest-burster sequence, their reactions are still priceless.How could Fox ever improve upon a film like Ridley's? After a pitch meeting with newbie, James Cameron, and him turning down a remake of Spartacus, the creative exec shouted 'what about alien 2?' James took a seat and listened then ran off to create a masterpiece. The difference between these two films is the subtext. Alien had none. As beautiful as it was, the characters were cliché and the dialogue lame. Ian holm did a great job, but aside from his malfunctioning synthetic, there wasn't much else.James built a force to reckon with around Ripley. Corporal Hicks, a talented Michael Biehn, private Hudson, the whiny soldier on his last days of service, private velasqez, the male-ass kicken female, the corporate snake played wonderfully by the slithering Paul Reiser and the sympathetic synthetic played by Lance Henriksen. These characters were drawn well from beginning to end and we sensed a bit of family between them. And lastly, Newt, the darling Carrie Henn who has since abandoned her days of acting and has become a grade school teacher. How I long for her to scream once more! With that said, the reason why this film worked was that it's a film in its own. There is no ""2"" after it and the names spells it all. Aliens is about multiple aliens. Multiple facets of life. The death of Ripley's daughter and her crying in the beginning saying that she promised to be home for her 6th birthday. Weyland Yutani playing the behind the scenes chess player and compromising people's lives in order to make a buck. (Haliburton anyone?) The concept of synthetics and androids in everyday life, being 1986 this seemed almost implausible, but now it's 2006 and those are just right around the corner. Did anyone catch the close resemblance between Bishop's hyperdyne system model and mr. cameron's cyberdyne systems from terminator? With only six variations of the 'alien suit' and the abandonment of H.R. Giger's designs, I was hesitant but became a huge fan after my first viewing of this film. I was 8 years old when I first saw it and it still has me in awe. This film is a DRASTIC departure from Ridley's haunted house on the nostromo. His was moody, dark, and claustrophobic. Cameron's is an extravagant action spectacle with character substance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
More than just a brilliant sequel. A stand-alone SciFi/horror monument!,"James Cameron is one of the world's most acclaimed directors thanks to massive and meticulously perfect blockbusters like ""Avatar"", ""Titanic"", and ""Terminator II: Judgment Day"". And righteously so, of course, but for us avid Sci-Fi & horror fanatics, he already was immortal because of the three iconic genre monuments he made during the 80s: ""The Terminator"", ""The Abyss"" and ""Aliens"". I'm personally convinced that, in the hands of practically every other director in the world, a sequel to the almighty 1979 landmark ""Alien"" would have become a failure. NOT in Cameron's capable hands, though.The reason why ""Aliens"" is such a superior sequel, and one of the greatest action/Sci-Fi movies in history altogether, is because it never once tries to copy the successful format of the original ""Alien"" but comes up with its very own and equally brilliant ideas. The first one featured non-stop claustrophobic tension, because almost all the action took place within the Nostromo spacecraft. ""Aliens"" is spread out over an entire interstellar colony, as well as other locations, and yet it still feels inescapable. ""Alien"" had a limited cast of characters that were scientists and astronauts, and that didn't know what they were up against. ""Aliens"" has an extended cast, including many tough and loud-mouthed mariners, and yet they are still cannon fodder.But the most unique thing, and definitely so for a sequel, is that Cameron dares to take the time to build tension and develop the characters further. Ellen Ripley metamorphoses into the strongest female heroine in cinematic history. In fact, thanks to Weaver's powerhouse performance of Ripley, a few other female characters and even the ""mother"" Alien itself, this is arguably the most feminist action/horror classic ever! Most of the male superiors are cowards or traitors, and the male warriors (mariners and Xenomorphs) strictly serve as bait and cannon fodder, while the women rule in this genius Sci-Fi spectacle. The set pieces are stupendous, the special effects are dazzling, and the final showdown between Ripley and the Alien Queen is the Mother - pun intended - of all climaxes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A terrible plot made into a very entertaining movie,"If ever a film summed up its director, this one is it. James Cameron is a shrewd producer, an excellent director... and a terrible writer.I won't include any spoilers, but a quick internet search (or even just a visit to the IMDb ""goofs"" section) will return a list of plot holes and factual errors that takes nearly as long to read as the film takes to watch (and most of them are so obvious that you WILL notice them even when watching the film for the first time).And yet, despite all those internal contradictions, despite the nonsensical science and moronic military tactics, and despite the almost cartoon-like characters (or perhaps partly because of them), it's still worth watching.The action sequences are fast and exciting but still easy to follow, there are several memorable one-liners, and the final confrontation is as iconic as it gets. If only it didn't take itself so seriously, maybe its flaws would come across more as a self-parody (like in Verhoeven's ""Starship Troopers"") and less as Cameron's lack of writing skills.It would be unfair to give it a very high score, but if you're willing to overlook the bad plot and implausible characters, you'll probably find ""Aliens"" a very entertaining action-horror hybrid.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I think the plot is far better than the super lackluster number 4 but I have to rate this last higher as at least there is personality and ideas in the way it's shoot anc acted.
Alien 2 is ""just"" an action movie with big explosions, and very cliché and dull characters.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"more sci-fi/action than horror,but a better movie than the origninal","although Aliens is not the iconic film that alien is,it is still a better film.this film adds a new element by having multiple aliens rather than just the one.it improves upon the look of the creatures,and while maintaining high suspense,adds more action.this film is less character driven than the first.the characters are more developed though and there is more of a group dynamic going on.we have some of the characters fighting each other,as well as the alien threat.the pacing is a bit better in this film.Obviously,this film is not responsible for the rebirth of horror/sci fi,since the original lays claim to that.but it is,in its own right a classic and will be remembered for a long time to come.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Definitive proof that sequels don't always suck,"In aliens, elen ripley is rescued by a military establishment that have sent colonies to lv246 (the planet on which the first alien came from). She joins them in their quest to reestablish contact after it is lost. However, the team are bombarded with monstrous aliens after finding a young girl called newt on board. Ellen makes a srtong bond with the youngster and vows to rescue her after she's kidnapped. And the ending is a complete rollecoaster of thrills and sheer horror.Sigourney weaver was fantastic in this (well deserved Oscar nod), and the action was non-stop. I prefer this to the first, which is a huge achievement in my mind.Watch aliens, you won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Another Sci-Fi Classic!,"I was impressed at the original Aliens. There is no words to describe how much better this film is. Everything is nearly perfect with this film especially the aliens and the horror scenes.To see this movie, I recommend that you watch the the 1979 version first because the plot is a direct continuation of that movie. In Aliens, Ripley has been in hypersleep for 57 years. She is upset that her daughter is gone and even more because no one believes her tale. But, the company sends her with Marines to figure out what happened to the colonists on the original planet Ripley was on 57 years before. The plot and the characters will keep you in suspense.The acting is top-notch. Almost every actor gave excellent performances. Signourey Weaver still is powerful playing Ripley. I was impressed with Carrie Henn as she plays a girl that survived the alien attacks on the colonists. Bill Paxton was decent even if he was a bit whiny.The special effects and the action are great. The explosions are top-of-the-art(only for that time period). The visual effects are stunning. The action scenes are fun to watch. There is more action than the first film because we see that Ripley can kick some serious butt.The music by James Horner adds spice to the movie.Overall, this is a perfect sci-fi/horror film. I rate this movie 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
B movie,"WOW, just wow. I remember watching this movie when i was a kid and, man did it freak me out. I just watched it again (2018) and i can't believe what a piece of garbage this is. There are sooooo many plot holes, cringe worthy scenes, and just utter disregard to reality. Yes this is a si-fy movie but MAN did they jump the shark! I just can't believe that this movie was praised at all. There are scenes where Cameron decided to ""intensify"" the action, with NO APPARENT reason!!!!! If its just me than ok. but please re-watch it. It will put this movie in a new perspective",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A Gasoline-Drenched, Chain-Smoking Semi-Spiritual Successor","Suspenseful and terrifying like the original, but in completely different ways. Where Ridley Scott's first film was loaded up with atmosphere, exploration and an overwhelming sense of terrified wonder at the habits of an unfamiliar life form, James Cameron's sequel is faced with the task of expanding upon a theme that's already been fairly thoroughly prodded. Dropping the intellectual angles and dramatic pauses in favor of unbridled, run-and-gun chaos, it still manages to feel akin to its predecessor via more than a monster suit and lead actress. While Aliens doesn't take as much time to appreciate the sights, they're still around, and they remain excellent examples of on-screen world building. The power of the aliens themselves seems very diminished - they're little more than waves of cannon fodder by the second act - but Cameron compensates with a bold determination to examine them as a versatile breed of fauna. Although its dalliances into action tripes can be distracting, and a few lines of dialog are eyeball-spinningly cheeseball, the film is still a success. How much of that is due to its young director's touch, rather than the power of the galaxy that had been established in the original, is open for debate.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Believe the hype, it's a classic.","Aliens is in fact one of my favorite science-fiction films. I also find it hard to believe that I was also only a year old when this movie came out and strangely enough, the special effects have held up quite well since 1986.As many of you already know, Aliens takes place 57 years after the events of the first encounter with the deadly alien. Ripley(Sigourney Weaver) is floating through space in hypersleep. Her escape pod is picked up by a deep-space salvage crew. She wakes up in a hospital where she meets Carter Burke(played with the right amount distrustworthiness by Paul Reiser) who informs Ripley about how long she has been floating in space. He also tells her that the Yutani Corporation has funded colonization of LV-426, the planet that the Nostromo(the ship from the first Alien film) landed on. Burke later shows up at Ripley's room with Lt. Gorman(William Hope) and tells her that contact has been lost with LV-426. Ripley tells them that it was the aliens had probably gotten the colonists. As her nightmares continue, she becomes convinced that the only way to end her nightmares is to go to the planet and see that the creatures are eliminated. So she goes. We next see her on the military ship, The Sulaco. She sees that many of the marines are very confident that they will succeed in their mission of exterminating the aliens. The marines include Hicks(Michael Biehn), Hudson(Bill Paxton), Vasquez(Jenette Goldstein), Sgt. Apone (Al Matthews), Drake(Mark Rolston), and an android(Lance Henriksen). They go to the planet and Ripley becomes a sort of surrogate mother to a lonely and terrified little girl named Newt(Carrie Henn). Newt tells that the aliens were in fact responsible for the disappearance of the colonists. Soon after, all hell breaks loose as each marine is picked off in the alien hive, thus leaving a only a small group of survivors.Aliens is probably one of the best movies to come during the eighties. Sigourney Weaver deserved the Oscar for best actress. The supporting performances are great also especially Bill Paxton who plays the frightened Hudson. He is probably my favorite character in the movie. Special praise should go to director James Cameron for keeping the action slick and the tension always mounting. I also think it was pretty clever with the film editing that made it look like that hundreds of aliens were all over the place when in actuality only six costumes were used. That's pretty tight.One gripe that I do have with the Alien films in general, are the aliens themselves which I think, are the most overlooked part of these movies. The aliens are the heart and soul of these films, but come off most of the time as just a really cool looking special effect. I'm not saying that's bad but come on the films should at least go into a little depth as to explaining what they are or where they came from. I mean, I wish a fifth alien movie or a documentary would be made that would go into depth to explain what they are or something like that.I have been a big fan of the alien series ever since I saw this movie. I even used to collect the Alien action figures that were popular from around like 1993-1995. Surprise, surprise, I still have them, most of which are still in good condition with the exception of about two or three. I'm just saying that to show you how big a fan of Aliens I am.Now about the other films in the series. In my opinion, Alien(1979) is probably the most overrated film in the series. Don't me wrong I liked the first film, it's just that it seems a bit dated and director Ridley Scott has made many better films since then. Alien 3(1992) has been unfairly judged as being the worst in the series. I think that happened because director David Fincher(Seven, Fight Club, The Game) was trying something new with the series and got badly criticized for it. Alien: Resurrection(1997) was directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who by the way is a visual genius. Before Resurrection came out, me and my best friend would get into arguments of whether or not Resurrection would actually surpass Aliens. To our surprise, it did surpass it as far as special effects went but, we were a little disappointed with the film's story. But it's a real shame though, that Alien: Resurrection is an even more underrated movie than Alien 3.Aliens gets an 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I have a theory that, this is where they got the idea. Since the first one was shocking, it also was a natural occurance that more is better, so why not have hundreds of aliens if one could shock.

James Cameron's Aliens is a superb science-fiction experience that improves upon its predecessor,"Ridley Scott left a major landmark on the science-fiction genre when he brought birth to 1979's 'Alien'. Treating audiences with engrossing visual imagery and hair-raising thrills, there is almost no wonder the film journeyed to success. This follow-up to the science-fiction thriller arrives with more of the same pulse- pounding human vs. alien onslaught, only with more and bigger surprises. Replacing Ridley Scott in the director's chair is visionary James Cameron following his success with science-fiction hit 'Terminator'. Cameron comes to the picture with a slightly more thoughtful direction and a bigger package of spine-chilling thrills and sharp visual effects that amount to a masterful sci-fi experience. Reducing on the suspenseful atmosphere in favor of more even balance of action and white-knuckle thrills, the film never fails to show Cameron knows how to keep things working. Set almost six decades after the first entry, this film sees the return of Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley, who wakes up from a cryogenic sleep and is facing charges from the catastrophe that lead to the death of her crew. With everyone back on Earth failing to buy into her story, Ripley goes on an investigation to another planet with a crew of space marines which include Corporal Hicks (played by Michael Biehn), Burke (played by Paul Reiser), Bishop (played by Lance Henrickson), Private Hudson (played by Bill Paxton), Lieutenant Gorman (played by William Hope), and Private Vazquez (played by Jenette Goldstein) along with a few others. Stumbling upon a colony of alien eggs that soon hatch and launch a violent onslaught against the crew, Ripley and the crew must fight to survive against the vicious horde while protecting a little girl named Newt (played by Carrie Henn) who's family has been killed.Whereas the previous film relied heavily on suspense and Ridley Scott's Gothic imagery to unleash the thrills, James Cameron goes a significantly different route in portraying the humans' heart-racing battle against the grotesque-looking extraterrestrial creatures. This amounts to splicing some action sequences in the mix of the eerie atmosphere, which pits the characters in a scarier and more heart-pumping fight for survival against an overwhelming colony of flesh-eaters. By all means, Cameron's method works like a charm. He successfully showcases an even balance that of pulse-pounding action and rollicking thrills in a mix that effectively places viewers in a boiling good time, but not that isn't prone to inducing nightmares. The first half focuses on the buildup of the characters along with exposition before transpiring to the second half which eventually places its foot on the gas for some white-knuckle, if occasionally gory alien onslaught. To add spice to the tension, the film powerfully showcases the vulnerability of Carrie Henn's Newt, a small defenseless little youngster who Ellen Ripley must protect in the midst of the chaos. Although there are maybe a few dull moments sprinkled throughout the picture, Cameron never seems to struggle to keep things moving. The space marine characters are slightly more developed and the chemistry between each of them which includes a few brief dosages of humor and wit. Alongside, Cameron also manages to feast the eyes with striking visual imagery painting the inside of the spaceship, capturing the sheer claustrophobia of the settings while paying reminiscence to the original film.With Ellen Ripley being the sole survivor of the aftermath of the first film, Sigourney Weaver returns to the lead role and is good as ever, if not slightly more. Weaver executes the role with same versatility and emotional grit of a strong female protagonist similar to the predecessor, particularly with her tough-as-nails line ""Get away from her, you bitch!"". The rest of cast consists of newcomers to the franchise including Paul Reiser as Corporal Hicks who shows off with a fairly decent performance. Michael Biehn plays Burke, a slightly more sinister and antagonistic member of the crew who shows little care of placing the crew in mortal danger. Biehn's performance stands strong, but certainly not in a fashion that stands out among anyone. Lance Henrickson does a fairly job at Bishop, the valiant one in the group. Jenette Goldstein, who would later go on to collaborate with James Cameron again for a minor role in 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day', boasts an incredible amount of charisma in her role with a small slice of witty humor added to the mix. Then, there is young Carrie Henn who plays Newt, a small girl who becomes a daughterly-like figure to Sigourney Weaver during the terrifying chaos. The film does a magnificent job on not only showcasing the vulnerability of the small-aged character, but beautifully establishing the emotional bond between her and Weaver. The rest of the large cast also succeeds in getting the job. Nothing however, that comes close to blowing Sigourney Weaver out of the water.Aliens is a superb science-fiction experience that boasts a thoughtful direction by visionary film mogul James Cameron, and an astounding blend of terrifying visual imagery and heart-stopping thrills. The film makes the rare achievement of improving upon the original, and that further demonstrates Cameron's immense talent.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of cinema's greatest ever sequels,"The biggest obstacle faced by a studio looking to cash-in on a surprise success that resonated well with both audiences and critics is the direction in which to take it. The seemingly obvious call would be to study the original and pick apart the ingredients which helped form, in the case of Alien, an instant science-fiction classic. While the sequel faced trouble getting the greenlight as Fox procrastinated over a project they felt was a costly risk, this delay in production was only leading to the sequel rights falling into the hands of the perfect guy for the job. Production on The Terminator was facing a lengthy delay due to scheduling conflicts, so director James Cameron found himself some spare time to pen a script. Only this wasn't to be called Alien 2, but Aliens, as Cameron sought to embrace the scope and ambition he would later become famous for.While Alien features gruff space truckers, Aliens is led by a band of buzz-cut space marines, and Cameron's idea was not to continue with the slow-burn, show-little approach of the original, but a relentless assault on the senses. It's certainly isn't that Cameron doesn't know how to generate tension (the slow beeping of the motion tracker and the moment trapped inside a room with a face-hugger is clear evidence that he does), but he has a different method of pay- off. A long build-up following by a genuinely terrifying jump-scare made you hold your breath in Alien, but when the indecipherable blobs turn into a huge hoard of the remorseless, slimy killing machine, it's difficult to catch it. It's incredibly long, with a climax that seems to go on forever. But Aliens truly puts you through the wringer, to the point that, by the end, you loathe the xenomorph just as much as Ripley (Sigourney Weaver).After spending 57 years in stasis, Ripley is picked up and rescued by her employers the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, the very company that sent the crew of the Nostromo to their doom. Her wild claims of a perfect alien hunter are dismissed, mainly because the planet it was originally discovered on was colonised years ago, and her flight officer license is revoked. When communication with the colony is inevitably lost, shifty company representative Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) convinces Ripley to join an expedition back to the alien planet to investigate and exterminate any alien lifeforms discovered. She reluctantly agrees, and finds herself on a mission accompanied by a rag-tag squad of marines, who all seem trigger- happy but incredibly naive about the dangers they will face. When they arrive, the only survivor is a little girl named Newt (Carrie Henn), who speaks of monsters who mostly come out at night... mostly.Sigourney Weaver is so terrific in this film that she received Academy Award nomination for Best Actress, something almost unheard of in the sci-fi/horror genre. Having learned that her daughter had died of old age just two years before she was rescued, her relationship with Newt and her eventual showdown with the alien queen is given a whole new layer. She is backed up by a supporting cast who help distinguish themselves in the platoon of grunts, with special mention going to Michael Biehn, Jenette Goldstein and, of course, the late Bill Paxton. They help elevate the film from an exciting sea of bullets and spattered alien carcasses to an engrossing thriller featuring characters you genuinely hope will make it out alive. Of course, they all don't, but Cameron makes almost every death memorable and occasionally oddly powerful. I still prefer the quiet horror of Alien, but I can completely understand why many prefer the deafening terror of Cameron's vision, but it can quite rightly take its place among cinema's greatest ever sequels.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A rarity in the world of sequels....,"Can it be possible; a sequel that is as good, if not better, than the original?  Yes, it not only can be possible, it is, and ""Aliens"" not only proves a fantastic sci-fi movie in its own right but again proves the power that Sigourney Weaver has in the right film, as well as the over-powering direction of James Cameron.Picking up 200 years after the fact, Weaver is once again thrown into a battle along with the Space Marines that are called to the planet where Weaver's team originally found the alien of the first film.  The colonies that have been built there have been obliterated of all life and they are being sent there to wipe out every last alien on the planet.Of course, in a movie like this, nothing is as it seems, and that's a positive quality.  Weaver misses nary a beat as Ripley, a woman as un-trusting of aliens, most humans and just about anything else in general as she was before.  It's only when they discover a small girl (Carrie Hehn) left alive that she finally finds something that perhaps shows she has some feeling left.Of course, there are other great performances by Biehn, Henriksen, Goldstein, Paxton and Reiser, playing well fleshed-out characters against a backdrop of desperation, fear and outright gut-wrenching horror as they find out their mission wasn't as easy as they all thought.But then comes James Cameron.  Having proven his mettle with ""The Terminator"", he works with a bigger budget and shows just as much ingenuity and flair for big, flashy action as any ten action directors.  But even if the story seems routine, Cameron's approach is not; he makes every single moment seem as fresh now as if it were being seen for the first time in motion picture history.  Always a good thing in science fiction, where there aren't exactly new ideas coming out every day.As with the original ""Alien"" (and Cameron's ""Terminator""), the last half-hour or so is so much edge-of-your-seat and nail-biting tension that you'll feel like a wrung-out wash rag by the time all is said and done, and rightly so.  And, more than ever, you'll empathize with Weaver as her character fights not only for her own survival, but for that of others as well.So, ""Aliens"" is great science fiction and great film-making, but is it a worthy addition to the saga?  Most definitely, especially when you consider that most sci-fi films can't muster HALF the story this one does, much less a sequel to one.Ten stars (eleven if I only could) to ""Aliens"", one of the best science fiction sequels (""Star Wars"" movies excluded) ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Probably the best action film ever made, and one of the best sci-fi films","This is James Cameron's best film. He used to be an action auteur (but I think he threw that completely away with Titanic). Aliens is a masterpiece of thrills. The set is so claustrophobic, it makes me shiver just thinking about it.The reason that this movie becomes so great, though, is the mother/daughter relationship between Ripley and Newt. This is such a realistic relationship. And the actress who plays Newt was one great child actor, every bit as good as Haley Joel Osment from The Sixth Sense. Like I said in my review of Alien, Ripley is a great character played by Sigourney Weaver, a great actress. Her suffering becomes ours. Also, notice how every scene takes place from her point of view. In the special addition DVD, though, there is a scene added where we see the colony (actually, Newt's father) find the aliens. This is used to introduce the colony's situation and to introduce Newt, but it was an enormous mistake to reinsert this scene back into the film. It breaks the rhythym quite terribly. It is a particularly long and clunky scene in the first place. It was enough when Paul Reiser told us that there has been a colony on that asteroid for many years. The audience knows right away that something is going to happen there with the aliens which will make Ripley have to go there. Now, with this scene having been reinserted, when the soldiers enter the colony and find a single life-form moving around, we know it is Newt (since that first scene kept focusing in on her). There is no surprise as their used to be. It should have just been left as a supplemental scene. Bad, bad mistake.Of course, that scene could not ruin this great film. Only really perceptive people who have a huge understanding of the language of film will ever notice it. But those of you who read this review, pay attention to that scene. I give this film a 10/10 because originally Cameron was smart enough to take that scene out. He must have reinserted it after he made Titanic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best film ever made?  Far from it.,"Aliens was terrific the first or second time watching it. But after that you'll see it is nothing more than a below average war movie set in outer space.  I tend to stay away from almost anything appreciated or hyped up by the mainstream public, because knowing people like I do, they tend to overexaggerate and act silly.  Aliens was alright as a good escapist movie for one viewing but James Cameron's filmmaking style is nothing to get excited about considering that he must payed the Oscar judges large amounts of cash to give his Titanic movie the thumbs up. There are much better, interesting, and creative movies out there that challenge viewer's grey matter.  Enjoy this movie but use some common sense.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"the second installment in the ""Alien"" saga is not only powerful in its visuals and genuinely thrilling, but a truly visionary science-fiction masterpiece","Very much like ""Psycho"", the first ""Alien"" movie received some mixed reactions upon its first release. Some admired it for its ability to twist the stomachs of its audiences; others thought it was overkill and disgusting. But as with Hitchcock's film, as time went by and people caught up with the genius of the masterpiece, it was only a matter of time before a sequel was made. And the sequel, titled ""Aliens"" is the closest a sequel has ever come to being equal to its predecessor. This is not only a great science-fiction movie, but it's a highly entertaining and gut-wrenching thrill ride that comes second I think to ""Die Hard"" as the greatest action movie of all time.In ""Aliens"", the sole survivor of the first movie, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has finally been picked up, still asleep in suspended animation after fifty-seven years. Many things have changed since her first encounter with the slimy parasitic monster from before. The planet from where the creature came from has been colonized. And then, not so coincidentally as Ripley soon finds out, contact is lost with the people on the planet and she will have to contend with the creatures, this time alongside a group of Marines. And just like before, it turns out to be a race against time for them to escape before the aliens, or something else, kills them.If you want a scary movie, ""Aliens"" will deliver. If you want a movie with lots of buildup and tons of successive action sequences, the movie will not disappoint you either. But here's what makes it so special. It will give you what you're expecting, but what you don't expect from such a movie of such a genre is visionary creativity at its very best. It's so much more than just a scary movie. It's backed by a plot and a strong story, great characters, and the special effects and suspense is all secondary to this. Combined, it forms a masterpiece.James Cameron who directed the picture also wrote the screenplay and it's these two elements that make ""Aliens"" what it is. At a certain point in the movie, Cameron does throw one scary scene after another at you, but before that, it's about developing the story with surprisingly strong characters. Each one is well-written and serves his or her purpose in the story. It's admirable again to see women in a science-fiction film not demoted to simply screaming and running away in the background. As in the first film, Sigourney Weaver's performance is the strongest accolade the movie has to boast. Michael Biehn plays very much the same character he did in Cameron's previous film ""The Terminator"" and he plays it just as well. There's also a great touch of Weaver's character bonding with a little girl played by Carrie Henn which in turn fleshes them out as human beings instead of just stock characters. But what I was really astounded by was the Bill Paxton character: a Marine who whines and complains and yammers throughout the whole story. The genius of Cameron's writing and Paxton's performance is that the character gripes nonstop and yet he's only irritating to the other characters and not to the audience whereas a weaker writing or performance would have done just the opposite.I saved talking about the visuals of the movie till after the characterization because that's how they rank in importance. Visually, the movie is even better than its predecessor. I do think the movie toned down just a little too much how dangerous just one of the creatures are, but perhaps this is necessary since there are dozens of them crawling and leaping and goring throughout the story. The aliens are still very scary in all three of their stages, but they are not reduced to simply running around chasing the humans. Again, Cameron adds some great new imaginative ideas based off the lifestyle and habits of colonial insects to make these creatures even more formidable and vicious.Some consider this movie to be even better than the first ""Alien"" picture. I have to disagree with that point, but it is very close between the two movies. Like the first, there are two versions: a theatrical release and the director's cut. My preference is the latter, since it opens up more imaginative scenes and fills some holes and overall completes the visionary masterpiece that James Cameron directed twenty-three years ago.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Didn't like it that much,"Now, I'm not a fan of calling movies overrated. And I'm not gonna do that, because I see why people love this film.I personally didn't enjoy it that much. All the characters besides Ripley aren't very likable, which made it hard for me to care if they got killed or not. I think Cameron knew that, and that's why he introduced Newt. Because everyone cares if a little girl is in danger. Well, for me it was just a cheap trick.And if I don't care that much about the characters, I can't give it an 8/10.But now we come to the positive things. The special effects, the designs and visuals are freaking amazing and set new standards for science fiction and action movies. The sets they built looked breathtaking then, and they still look breathtaking now. Computer effects age, real visuals don't. And the alien queen, wow, this must be one of the coolest monsters in movie history.I'm a huge fan of the original Alien, but I get that this has to be judged differently because it's a different kind of movie. Saying it sucks because it's not like Alien is stupid.I didn't think the movie as a whole is a masterpiece, because of the problems I had with it. But again, that's just the personal feelings I had. I watched it 3 times, first time as a teen and I hated it. Second time couple of years later, and I just didn't like it. And the third time, I thought it was good. Not great, good.

Overrated,"When talking about movies with someone recently, I was surprised, and embarassed, to admit that I had not seen ""Aliens"", the much loved and respected James Cameron sequel to the classic ""Alien"". I had the DVD, buried away, and I finally watched it. I was spurred on after checking reviews for the film, and noting how highly ranked on IMDb's top movies list it is. And I was surprised even more by just how average the film seemed to me...The first hour of ""Aliens"" is excellent. It sets us up nicely for the action, but then when it arrives, the film loses steam completely. I noted that I could tell exactly what was going to happen, the action was just as predicatable and even uninteresting, but could that just be because ""Aliens"" has influenced so many low-budget wannabes in its wake, that it now appears redundant to a first-time viewer? .... Maybe.So, I put that to the back of my mind as I mulled over the film the next few days, and came to my conclusion. It is not a bad movie. It does what it is meant to do, but would I watch it again, as I would the first one? No. As for its legacy and continued acclaim, I have to say that it is one of the most overrated films that I've seen.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Tons of action and tons of aliens...,"Whereas the first, and original, ""Alien"" movie from 1979 was more of a thriller / horror Sci-Fi movie in space, then this 1986 continuation steps it up a notch and turns it into a fast paced action movie. I could imagine that some fans of the 1979 movie would not particularly enjoy this change of genre, but personally I did enjoy it quite a lot. In fact, I think that ""Aliens"" is the best movie of the entire ""Alien"" franchise so far.What makes ""Aliens"" special to me is a myriad of things. First and foremost it is the abundance of alien creatures that are present in this movie. Sure, the cat-and-mouse chase from the 1979 movie with a single alien was nice. But having a whole hive of aliens running around in the 1986 was just much more menacing. And the slight evolution and changes made to the alien creatures in this 1986 movie compared to the first movie was also a welcomed detail. Secondly, director James Cameron managed to put a very interesting story to the screen, and he directed the movie quite nicely. Thirdly, the characters in the movie were all very well-detailed and fleshed out to help tell the story of ""Aliens"". And finally, the ensemble of cast, which were just fabulous.""Aliens"" is a definite MUST watch if you enjoy Sci-Fi, and especially if you enjoy the ""Alien"" franchise and universe.The characters portrayed in ""Aliens"" were all quite well-detailed, as I mentioned above. And they all did add a lot of flavor to the story, despite not giving us much background story to their persons. But their backgrounds were not important here, as they are soldiers and their personalities more than spoke for themselves.

And this feat is really one of the key ingredients to ""Aliens"" being such an enjoyable movie. Sigourney Weaver is, of course, the embodiment of the franchise, and she had much help from talents performers such as Carrie Henn, Michael Biehn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen and Bill Paxton.The special effects in ""Aliens"" were great, with lots of nice details and personal touches to the individual marines. And the environment was realistic and believable.As I mentioned earlier, ""Aliens"" is the best of all the movies in the franchise.

"In space, no one can hear you scream.","One of the best works of science fiction and horror, of the history of the cinema, undoubtedly, undeniable, Aliens is the closest to perfect sci-fi, a masterpiece that to this day has no rival in its field . Combining terror and science fiction is not always a simple task, it takes some intellect and knowledge to create an exorbitantly incredible world, Aliens accomplishes that, and for terror? We need the touch of the unknown, the dread of something we know nothing, because as Lovecraft once said, the oldest fear of the human being is the fear of the unknown. Maybe few times we have felt the sensation of being trapped next to something that we have never seen in our life, but do not worry, Aliens will make us feel that in a shocking way. Ah! But there is one more topic here. All the action is the best.Now we will combine 3 things, science fiction, terror and action. The result? Aliens.And what does that mean? 2 hours with 34 minutes of suspense and the biggest entertainment of the cinema, full of scenes as iconic as original, special effects of maximum quality, incredible sounds that have become class marks, impeccable performances, tense and entertaining dialogues, and above all, the best Alien in history. The alien of this movie, a life form as frightening as it has fascinated the minds of fans since 1979, traumatized children and exploited the confines of science fiction.I have seen this movie at least 7 times, every time is incredible and full of entertainment, so much that sometimes I wish to forget it to only be able to feel that maximum emotion and fear that the first time, but despite having seen it 7 times, I seek to see it again and again, in simple words.A masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the best films of the 80's!,"James Francis Cameron's Aliens is his best film to date (besides a couple of Terminating exceptions).  It combines an original (though duplicated 6 years later) story with wam bam action that takes time to start, but once it does, it doesn't stop.  Cameron is a great director of action films, and this proves it.The tale is about Ripley- Sigourney Weaver (sole survivor of the ship that was attacked by an Alien) who after 57 years of laying dormant (she went into cryno-sleep) must go with a group of soldiers to investigate strange doings on the same planet with the gestating Alien.  But this time, there are many to go around, and once it starts, it just doesn't stop (including a startling ending).  Better than the first, this film co-written and directed by Jim Cameron is a great example of the sci-fi thriller and will hopefully stay around for a long time.""Get away from her you bitch!""  Damn right.  A++",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the best films of all time.,"Alien is an excellent horror film. Cameron, wisely decided to take the sequel in its own direction and with that, he created a mind bogglingly entertaining film that still manages to preserve the atmosphere of the first movie. Arguably, the elements he bring actually top what the original offered. This is a movie that is iconic in every aspect: in scenes and in dialogue. It holds up extremely well despite being nearly thirty years old. The effects are amazing, perhaps the best animatronics I've ever seen. The final battle with its buildup and shock, pays off and blows you away. Its lead, Ripley, remains one of the best female characters (and just plain characters) of all time, but the rest of the cast are memorable and interesting too. In my opinion, this is a film that belongs extremely high up in any scifi fan's top ten.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"One Of The Greatest Action, Science-Fiction & Horror Films Of All Time.","There are very few sequels in cinema that manage to surpass the originals and overcome the expectations of the first chapter's loyal & faithful fans. And James Cameron's Aliens manages to do exactly that by taking the original story of Ridley Scott's Alien and expanding upon it in ways most sequels are afraid to as this second chapter is way more bigger & action-packed than its predecessor and succeeds not just as a great sci-fi horror but redefines the action genre as well.A wildly entertaining, immensely satisfying & one spectacular roller-coaster ride of non-stop action that refuses to age even after three decades and continues to rank amongst the most intense & fulfilling pieces of action films ever made, James Cameron's Aliens is arguably the best film of the franchise, certainly one of the greatest sequels of all time and one of the finest & most influential examples of its genre(s). A perfect follow-up to Alien that, just like its predecessor, is immortal for its contribution to cinema.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but not as great as everyone says","Certain genre films manage to strike a resonating chord with their audiences, and achieve not only popular success but a lingering cult that glorifies the movie into neo-scriptural status. 'Blade Runner' is such a film, perhaps the shining example of a genre film that too many people think is better than it really is; but 'Aliens' is another excellent example of a film that people elevate out of proportion to how good it really is.To be fair, 'Aliens' is a strong film. It has interesting characters, an engaging set-up, and some of the better production design ever seen in a sci-fi film. It's also disturbingly pro-military, which is understandable given its Reagan-era roots, but comes off more than a little hawkish now. And it does achieve what it set out to do, and what most sequels never can; to be as good as or better than the original. Granted, Ridley Scott's 'Alien' was a different type of film, a suspense/horror movie, where this is an action film (and yes, I am aware of parallels to 'Mummy/Mummy Returns').Watching 'Aliens' now is a different experience than seeing it back then; you have the following two movies in your memory (whether you want them there or not), and it's funny to see Paul Reisler (Carter Burke) doing anything other than watered-down comedy (he's very good here, by the way). The only other really recognizable actor is Sigourney Weaver, whom they unsuccessfully tried to build a franchise around; genre dorks like me can pick out Michael Biehn, whose career essentially peaked with this film, and of course Bill Paxton is in the background crying and bitching.The film comes off as very eighties when viewed through modern eyes. Burke in particular seems to have gotten stuck in 1985 (though Ripley's civilian garb is also horribly dated). Most of the military production design still holds up, however; ironically it succeeds in that by not being too futuristic. The tanks, dropship, etc, all still look and feel pretty cool.So why is this film not the be-all end-all that so many proclaim it to be? It's a good film, sure; the build up is particularly tense and effective, and the rough camaraderie between the marines is still enjoyable (though more of them seem to come off as dicks than I remember). The slow approach to the settlers' camp and the way Cameron chooses to unveil the aliens  remember, at that time we didn't all have little plastic dolls of them  is also very inventive, and while this is an action film, Cameron injects a healthy dose of horror into it.My basic issues with the film (which my recent re-watching did nothing to dispel) really came down to two things: Newt, and Cameron's 'mother' issues. The entire last third of the film, from a plot standpoint, is wholly unnecessary, because of these two items. The characters battle and beat (or at least hold off) the aliens and are well on their way out when, inexplicably, the clever and nimble-fingered Newt falls down an air vent, and we get a long, pointless detour that not only sours this film but mostly poisons the next two and the very concept of the aliens altogether.Kids are hard to do in genre films. Spielberg did a decent job with Short Round in 'Temple of Doom' and Alex O'Connell in 'Mummy Returns' manages to work well. But most of the other times, including here, kids are just annoying precocious plot devices. Newt doesn't bring anything to this film other than a lot of screaming; she tells us nothing about the aliens we don't learn from other sources, she sheds no light on the colonists, and she isn't even particularly effective comic relief. The only purpose she serves is to introduce the main sub-theme in the movie, Cameron's mother complex. By awakening Ripley's maternal instincts, Newt's presence sets us up for the ridiculous end-duel between Ripley, in a wearable forklift, and the woefully overdone Queen alien, an unnecessary invention that looks silly and cheapens the horror value of the aliens forever.Viewed with hindsight now, one can see that 'Aliens' could also be called 'T2 version 0.95'. Many similar elements, and even similar shots, are used in both films (compare Vasquez's intro with Sarah Connor's; the misapprehension of the lead character, a non-combatant, upon their first encounter with an android; the role both Newt and John play in re-humanizing their mothers; and so on). There's nothing really wrong with this  and Cameron would hardly be the first director to mine himself for ideas, and, frankly, you could do worse than steal from 'Aliens' for inspiration. But it's interesting to watch Cameron test several ideas out in this movie before fleshing them out in what is arguably his greatest work (come on, you didn't think I was referring to 'Titanic', did you?).'Aliens' remains an enjoyable and well-done film, if a bit dated, and I know I spent too much time here debunking myth and not enough praising the effective parts of the film, which are numerous. The longer-cut DVD adds nothing that you really missed in the first place (I could have lived without seeing Newt's parents) and imbues the early part of the film with pacing more appropriate for a novel (which probably explains why it was pared down). For sheer genre fun, the first two-thirds of this movie are hard to top, and it's not difficult to see why it has engendered such feverish devotion from genre fans. It's certainly worth a viewing if you haven't seen it recently. By and large the Alien franchise was pretty good ('Alien 3' being the extremely notable exception), and it never gets better than it does here. For most of the picture, anyway.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
'Aliens' is one thrilling scene after the other.,"Sigourney Weaveer returns as Ellen Ripley, the sole survivor of the alien attack on the mining ship Nostromo. She journeys back to the planet LV-426 where her crew had encountered an alien species for the first time. This time she must deal with dozens of the alien species, who have since colonized. The result is a thrilling, high-powered, action-packed and suspense battle to the finish.James Cameron did an excellent job directing, creating an intense atmosphere full of suspense and action, and directed a cast who gave solid and in-depth performances. Each character gave a memorable and unique style of acting including those of: Weaver's on screen drama mixed in with sarcasm and wit; Bill Paxton's wise-cracking and hyper personality; Michael Biehn's calm and never-say-die attitude; Jenette Goldstein's macho image; and Carrie Henn's enduring and spirited character.The special effects were realistic and spectacular. James Cameron, David Giler and Walter Hill did an awesome job on the story, making the plot of the movie interesting and intriguing, leaving no room for plot holes and keeping the entire film's momentum going.

Well get it on they do and the viewer is almost exhausted from rooting and fighting just from their own seat. Non-stop action, good story, outstanding monsters and excellent directing too. It is no wonder this movie was a success too. I have seen this so many times but it still delivers in the moment it is being watched. When I caught this in the movies, it was because my preferred movie was sold out. My family of five quickly bought tickets to this and sat three rows from the front as there were no other seats. We were just glad to get into a show. I looked over at my family and the audience during this flick several times only to see everyone glued to the screen with expressions and emotions on their faces and I wondered do I look like that? LOL yes I did. Excitement and tension does that. There is a scene in this movie where you get the chills more than once but this one stands out. It is when they discover that the Aliens are not just animals but thinking creatures. I have the collectors edition and enjoy the extended version which is almost 2.5 hours long yay!

One of the greatest sci-fi action films ever made .....,"Aliens is one of the greatest sci-fi action films ever made. If the first film was horror, this one was more like an adventure. It was a lot less darker than Alien. Unlike Alien, there were quite a few likable characters. Especially Jennette Goldstein as the tough dikey soldier. Even Lance Henriksen as the robot was a lot more amicable compared to Ian Holm in the first part.I think the Alien series could be a bit right wing. In the first part, you had Ripley not letting in the compromised explorer team that has brought back an alien with them. In the second part, the soldiers are not allowed to use guns while exploring the space station even though there are indications that alien creatures are coming towards them. All this because the mother corporation wants some of these aliens alive.This is more of an out and out action film than the first one which relied on tense build ups.

May be the best horror film of all time.,"This is one of my favorite movies ever. It is awesome.When Aliens comes up on cable I still find it hard not to watch even though I've seen it over 20 times.It is no longer scary for me, but it is still such a great movie and filled with great lines, especially from Bill Paxson.If you want to be scared out of your pants, watch Alien 1 first, then Aliens 2, alone in the dark after a few cups of coffee.In Alien 1, Director Ridley Scott uses a camera trick of leaving open space in the scene, creating a not-so-subtle expectation in the viewer that something scary will pop into the space. This of course rarely occurs, so the viewer builds incredible tension that is never resolved.James Cameron starts up Aliens 2 with the same trick, but then shoves that aside for a never-ending onslaught of Aliens from all directions.Aliens 3 was pretty weak.Aliens 4 was better than 3, but still nowhere near as good as 1 and 2.Just saw Alien vs Predator.

"A sequel on par with the first film, and one that helped cement the Alien franchise.","I really liked the movie Alien, the first of this franchise. There is no doubt that it is one of the best and most remarkable horror films ever made, and one of the ""fathers"" of contemporary sci-fi cinema. This film was thought to give logical continuity to the story started in that film, and I think it couldn't be better than it is. There are many people who consider the film to be excessively dated, with sets and effects that look old. I strongly disagree. It's true that digital and CGI are not here, but if you think about the amount of bad CGI and bad effects that we have to swallow in today's movies, it's really nice to see a movie with effects that work well and look amazing fifty years later. .When Ripley is saved over fifty years have passed since the events of the initial film. She arrives in a world that has continued to spin while she sleeps, and which does not believe her account. Still, they ask him to return to space when a colony, newly created on the planet where the first Alien was found, suddenly stops communicating. It's pretty clear that someone knows more than they're saying, and that there are, again, very strong interests from a financial point of view. But Ripley will figure it all out in due time.The film is extraordinary and is completely at the level of its direct predecessor: the script has an excellent development, knows how to involve and capture the public's attention. Okay, there's a similar story, with the return to that planet and the return of the aliens, but the premise that leads to the return is the best and most convincing, and we don't feel tired or downtime. There's a pleasant tension, which deepens as the threat grows, and even when we don't see the xenomorphs, the fact that we know they're around increases that tension and the feeling of threat.Cameron continues to prove his genius as a director, and manages to extract the best from everyone involved in his project. In particular, the actors. Sigourney Weaver is at the highest level and gives us an anthology work, which will open doors for her as an actress and which will mark her for life. The rest of the cast does not stand out so much, but we can praise the efforts of actors like Michael Biehn, Lance Henriksen, William Hope, Jenette Goldstein and Al Matthews. Carrie Hen, in part, is the weakest link in this cast, as her character only appears to arouse empathy and for us to connect more intensely with what we are seeing. The truth is that the way her character - a child - survives in that situation is frankly implausible, almost an authentic miracle.Technically, the film is fantastic. It even seems like a new and relatively recent film, if you don't know what you're watching and that it was released in 1986. The cinematography is clean, sharp and there is an excellent filming and editing job. The effects are done the old-fashioned way, without the overwhelming appeal of digital, and they work amazingly well. See, for example, how the droid cut in half looks, how believable and authentic it looks.

Sigourney Weaver is back as Ripley, and this time, she's not just a stock character avoiding gruesome death at the hands of a nightmarish monster. To be sure, she does do that, but James Cameron completely revamps her character. She's scared as hell, but she's a tough cookie when it really matters. Especially when it comes to Newt (Carrie Henn), a young girl whom Ripley takes on as a surrogate daughter. Paul Reiser is a little hammy in the beginning, but he's nevertheless effective as the corporate tagalong who may not be telling everything he knows. And Michael Biehn makes for a very sympathetic Hicks, adding a little understated romantic chemistry with Ripley. Everyone else, including James Cameron regulars Bill Paxton and Jenette Goldstein, are very effective.Once again, James Cameron has created a superlative motion picture. But instead of creating the epics we have become used to, this is a movie in top form of the kind where he made his mark on Hollywood: the science fiction thriller. It's not perfect, and arguably his weakest film. But it contains some of the most frighteningly tense and scary moments ever to grace the silver screen.One of the greatest sequels of all time and one hell of a ride, ""Aliens"" is a must see for the action and/or horror lover, or any adrenaline junkie looking for a rush.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Why is it so overrated?,"This movie gets outstanding reviews and it seen as one of the best sequels to anything ever but I really don't get why.This movie is just a dumbed down, Americanized version of the first one. While the first one was a novel movie filled with poise and tact and some great directing, this one copies its plot but makes it bigger and loses all of the poise and tact in exchange for mindless shooting and action scenes. Sure it can maybe be a fun watch if you haven't watched the first one and so your expectations aren't very high, but watching this after seeing Ridley Scott's masterpiece leaves you kind of annoyed. It's the exact same plot but with more aliens who have somehow become easier to kill so the movie has cooler action scenes.In short, the second movie takes the first movie, removes everything that makes it great, and leaves us with some Arnold Schwarzenegger type movie.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Brilliant Space Adventure,"'Aliens' from James Cameron is his definite second-best film he produced in the 80s, second only to his true classic 'The Terminator'. This sequel is simply amazing in it that it manages to be far superior to its predecessor.The film is filled with Cameron's brilliant attention to detail when it comes to Science Fiction. He expands the concept of the Aliens far more and does it without any irky add ons. Additionally the film is filled with many brilliant memorable moments, backed by an excellent soundtrack and Cameron's nightmarish set-design.Sigorney Weaver and Michael Biehn are only two people in the extremely talented cast which is just quirky enough to be memorable, but not so much that it would distract the viewing experience. Add to this some of the best action-sequences ever put on film and you've got 'Aliens'.Recommendable for anyone with even the slightest interest in SciFi.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nowhere near as good as the original,James Cameron's militaristic sequel to Alien lacks all of the qualities that made the original so special. This movie is all about gunfights and splattering the sets with alien guts. There are no subplots or interesting characters just a bunch of macho military lug heads with foul mouths and big guns. There is no science as there was in the original. This is just a war movie with aliens.Sigourney Weaver returns and straps on a big one. Paul Reiser is completely miscast and doesn't transfer from TV to film.

"""They mostly come at night!

It certainly seems to fit the style of films from the 80's and it has improved upon the first, purely because of what more it could do 7 years later.There are hints of romance and although she can be a tad annoying, Newt adds to the tension that they are all facing, because they have to protect her.It's a great action film full of explosions, danger, bad guys and conspiracy.It's the one of the series that I have seen most, because it is so much more accessible to me.

A sci-fi action masterpiece,"I can honestly say that 'Aliens' could be the most exciting and thrilling film ever made! That may sound a bit rash, I know. But I genuinely believe it is true. Cameron plunges you into a white-knuckle thrill ride like no other. But they key thing is, this is done with intelligence.Lots of action films have a tendency to screw up pacing; often they favor more action scenes. Aliens however excels in pacing. It's a good hour and a bit before we first lay eyes on our foes. The time before is however, very critical. Mr.Cameron made sure to maintain suspense and fear of the unknown. These aspects were critical as it was these features that made the original 'Alien' so effective and successful. Ridley Scott established in the first film, that the most frightening fear is that of the unknown. Not knowing which corner the alien could be hiding behind and only seeing short glimpses of the alien greatly increases the fear factor.James Cameron retains this key rule, but makes 'Aliens' a unique film.The characters are simply fantastic, with not a single cast member giving a bad performance. Sigourney Weaver reprises Ripley to great effect helping to get across her new depth. Paul Reiser plays Carter Burke to great effect. You can't help but have a certain hatred towards his character. Carrie Henn is also amazing as 'Newt' despite being such a young age. The characters that make this film however, are the Marines. The scripting is sharp, witty and hilarious and the marines lines do not fail to disappoint. Michael Biehn is fabulous as the heroic Hicks, but for me, the real star of the show is Bill Paxton as Hudson. A combination of phenomenal acting and top notch writing. In fact I dare say that Hudson could be my all-time favorite film character.Overall, Aliens is an absolute masterpiece. A perfect combination of Sci-fi, horror and action. I have seen this film in excess of 20/25 times and each time it is equally thrilling. I can promise you that once viewed, you'll want a good sit down and a rest.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not only a brilliant sequel, but a classic horror thriller on its own.","Aliens is a brilliant sequel to a masterpiece. AND it is a masterpiece on its own right. This is a film where the director James Cameron cared for the story, characters, special effects, thrills and scares like his life depended on it. It starts perfectly, just like the original, countering on the small escape shuttle from the Nostromo after 57 years have passed...one of the things that Cameron excelled on was his faithfulness to link reminders of the first film i.e. the view-screen with the dead Nostromo crew's profiles highlighted at the Board meeting between Ripley and the company executives, and the lecture she gives the marines about the crew member Kane and what happened...superb. Aliens is also action packed once the marines encounter the dreaded creatures at their lair in the sub station, the audience are gripped until the very end.The performances are top class as well. Another excellent turn from Sigourney Weaver. Michael Biehn is great as Dwayne Hicks. Bill Paxton was superb and funny as Hudson. Jeanette Goldstein rocked as Vasquez, her bandanna wardrobe reminded me of Robert Shaw's Quint in Jaws. And like that shark classic, this film is a winner because you end up caring about the characters and hope that they escape from the terrible menace they face.Alien is a Masterpiece. Well, that goes twice for Aliens, one of the greatest sequels and greatest horror science fiction movies ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Still gets my adrenaline going.,"I remember when I was a young girl getting Aliens for Christmas (my dad let me watch Poltergeist when I was 11, this was the next step up).I wasn't too keen on Alien at the time, seeing the John Hurt/chest bursting scene when I was so young might have been one reason but I think the truth is I wasn't too keen on the large amounts of suspense.Aliens at the time I first saw it was the perfect film, suspense but with amazing action scenes that had you willing the marines and Ripley to get through it.Maybe 14 years later and it still remains one of my favourites. The acting is superb, the effects stand the test of time and the story has me on the edge of the seat even though I must've seen it 30 times.

"Aliens is good, Alien is better","Aliens is the sequel to Alien you can already tell. This movie seems more of a Sci-fi rather that Horror.The movie starts out with a crew finds Ripley's small ship from the first movie as it crash-lands. When Ripley wakes, the crew tells her that it is now 2094 since she was asleep for 57 more years. They also tell Ripley that the aliens from Xennomorph (the mysterious planet) are being colonized and that they will need lots of firepower for all the aliens.Ripley joins the crew which is a military team goes to Xennomorph to hunt the aliens. Ripley will only join them if they are going to kill the aliens and not to make the same mistake in 2037. The team needs to be careful not to let other teammates get Facehuggers connected to them so more aliens would not come.As the team battle their way though the aliens, it's just down to Ripley and a young girl. The two find the Alien Queen who is making for Facehuggers. All hope seems lost until Ripley gets into a exoskeleton suit which is later seen in Avatar.As Ripley says ""Get away from her you b***h!"" she battles the Alien Queen as the two escape the alien effected base and sleep for more numbers of years.I give Aliens a 9 out of 10 since this movie is more Sci-Fi that Horror.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A Dozen Movie Marines visit LV-426:  An Alien asks, ""Who ordered Takeaway?"".","Look out the Movie Marines are on their way! Dinner will soon be here, yum, yum.Well, missing out on his first chance to, shall we say rewrite, the first and the great Alien movie, his choice? We now have Walter Hill having ago for himself, the second time around. Looks like someone who didn't like Science Fiction work, he certainly knows which side his bread is buttered now.For some reason or other, the original role for Hicks had been given to James Remar, who played Ajax in Walter Hill's magnificent gang movie The Warriors (1979). His departure, as well as British born Director of Photography Dick Bush, whose work as Cinematographer on Tommy (1975), Yanks (1979) and Trail of the Pink Panther (1982) for examples, does leave some doubt and questions. To be replaced for creative differences because you didn't, it would seem, hit it off with the then Aliens Producer, Gale Ann Hurd. Oh, by the way, she, at the time was married, from 1985 to 1989, to the then Aliens Director James Cameron.We are given the impression that Aliens consists of just a few tightly grouped movie-making buddies scratching each other's back, same old Actors working, again, for the same old Director, there goes the Character Development then.While the Alien franchise is one of my favourites, I personally do think that Aliens is more overrated. While not the weakest of the whole collection, to me, this is just a bug hunt with to much off the ""yahoo"" and ""yeeha"" mentality. It's forever in in our face, and in the end is more important than the actual beasts that the movie should be concerning itself with.The first Alien movie, (Directed by Ridley Scott and released in 1979), is a Historical Movie Milestone of tense character development and visual art. This, Aliens, is the unsensational opposite, having gone for the Lock and Load and Egos' are Us direction, he has turned an opportunity of imagination and creativity into thought-less sensation. Looking as though it was quickly thrown together, the Thunderbirds models were looking a little thin by the end of this movie.It seemed, allegedly, that Ms Weaver threatened to do no more Alien movies after seeing the final cut.The Bold as Brass and over the top Rent-a-Heroes are the epitome of the over zealous Movie Marines that is seen in just about every movie ever made.

Action and adventure galore!,"If you saw ""Alien"", now that was horror.  I can't put ""Aliens"" in that genre.  What I saw was non-stop action and adventure, suspense and drama in a science fiction setting.  The aliens were not invincible.  Ten times as many aliens died as marines.  Paul Reiser  was wonderfully sleazy as the villain.  No tears were shed for him!  Sigourney Weaver (Rippley) is tough as nails in a soft-hearted way.  Is that possible?  The rest of the cast make for Xenofodder with the exception of Michael Beihn and the android, Bishop.To me the defining moment was the shuttle sequence.  The pilot did not scream or cry as the crew from ""Alien""  did.  She died going for her gun.  The special effects of the crash were spectacular.  The aftermath of the crash devastating.I share the same opinion as many that this sequel was the best that was ever done, and far surpasses the other three movies in this series.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Equal to, but much different than the original.","Aliens is without a doubt one of the better sequels ever made. The original film, directed by Ridley Scott was more of a horror film which took place inside a vast cargo ship out in the vastness of space. Aliens, the first big budget venture from James Cameron, is more of an action film. It's filled with shoot-outs, explosions, and has a much larger cast. Most of the action takes place in tight quarters as a group of intergalactic marines battle an army of ""xenomorphs"" which has wiped out a colony on the planet where the crew from the original film first encountered them. The film is relentless as the embattled humans try to ward off the superior numbers of creatures, and escape back into space.The cast is terrific. Sigourney Weaver is back to play ""Ripley"", the only surviving member of the cargo ship from part one. She and her cat have been drifting through space for 57 years before being rescued. She has not aged due to the hibernation process which is used to transport people on long space voyages in these and other space-oriented films. She tries to adjust to life closer to Earth on a space station, but it isn't easy. After a while, contact is lost with the colony which has been set up on the distant planet where the creatures were discovered. Ripley is sent out with a team of tough-talking marines to investigate, since she's the only person who's seen these creatures and lived to tell about it. This big, evil company she works for always seems to be protecting these creatures, and they probably figure this mission would be a good way to get rid of her along with the expendable marines.Some of these marines (the ones who live past the first 45 minutes) are a hoot. Bill Paxton pretty much rode his character to stardom. Michael Biehn, who replaced the troubled James Remar, also fills out his role nicely. All of the soldiers are upstaged by Jenette Goldstein, however. She's a James Cameron regular who plays the toughest marine in the unit. Right down to her last scene, she's outstanding.The set design and production values are incredible. The weapons and equipment these soldiers use looks like it could really work. Cameron's attention to detail is well on display in this futuristic world. You can see why studios would later grant him so much money to make movies. The $18 million it cost to make this film wouldn't even cover the catering on one of his films now. Aliens grossed about $80 million in theaters and has made countless more dollars in the home market since its release.There is one BIG plot hole that prevents me from giving it a perfect score, though. I don't know if anyone else caught this, but there is a problem with how the people in the colony discovered the alien ship. We are led to believe that Paul Reiser's character sent the colonists out to the ship and they became impregnated with the creatures. But wouldn't the colonists have found that ship already? Surely every inch of that planet would have been mapped out before any colony was built! And what about that beacon which led the cargo ship in the original film to the site? Wouldn't the colonists have also heard this beacon? I know this script was monkeyed around with for years, so any explanation of these glitches may be out there somewhere........9 of 10 stars. The Hound.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Sequel Worthy of the Original,"Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) returns to her base, only to find she's been asleep for many decades, and her daughter is now dead. She tells the story of the alien, is not believed, but is called into service again once the aliens she spoke of coincidentally become known. (We might ask how they are found almost exactly the same time she notifies them of the aliens rather than years prior or years later, but let's not get picky.) There are now more aliens, including a swarm of full-sized ones (not just the single one from ""Alien""). And the queen! Holy cow! And, of course, they have to go deep into the hive to stop the aliens from hurting the colonists (although, in all fairness, I think the aliens were there first).How often does a sequel really compare to the original? Other than with ""The Godfather Part Two"", I can only think of one example: ""Aliens"". The general idea is the same as the first film: group of stranded space explorers attacked by aliens must survive. The difference: more aliens, better cast and better technology (using forklifts to kill aliens is awesome).I have to give a shout-out to Carrie Henn, who played the young Rebecca ""Newt"" Jorden. She was amazing, and I really wish she would have continued acting. I hear she's now 31 and teaching in California or something, having never made another film. This is too bad, as she really tied the picture together. I don't know if Ripley needed a daughter figure to replace her dead daughter (this seems very contrived), but it worked.Lance Henriksen appears as Bishop, probably his best role. In the future, Henriksen sells out and appears in every straight-to-video horror film he can get a part in, but back in 1986 this was a break-through role for him. Forget Data from ""Star Trek"" (as cool as Brent Spiner is), Lance Henriksen's Bishop is king. Bill Paxton is also great as Private Hudson, with the immortal ""Game over, man"" line. Maybe not Paxton's best role (he's also great in ""Weird Science"" and ""Twister"", you know) and he is a bit whiny at times, but he's a welcome addition to the cast.As for Paul Reiser, forget that guy. He's only good for co-starring alongside ugly women (here and in ""mad About You""). His character of Carter Burke is so typical of lawyers. I prefer the lawyer from ""Jurassic Park"". But hey, that's just me. At least it's not Billy Crystal.There is an ""illegal alien"" joke i found in poor taste, not because I was offended, but because I assume that in the future the concept of ""illegal alien"" will have no more meaning.Overall, just as good as the first. It runs a bit long with the director's cut (two hours and thirty-seven minutes) but was really enjoyable. The guy I watched it with -- Brandon -- was ready to rent ""Alien 3"", but Family Video doesn't carry it. What a scam, eh? But anyway, check this one out -- you know coming from James Cameron (""The Abyss"", ""Terminator II"") it has to be good.

"""James Cameron's ""Aliens"" Delivers Thrills, Heart, and Unforgettable Action""","""Aliens"" is a thrilling and intense masterpiece of sci-fi action that surpasses its predecessor in every way.

The marines are all dudes who you'd actually want at your side in a real battle, and they all have their own issues, adding so much depth to their characters. Ripley has leadership qualities that are superhuman and continues to rally round when the moments seem impossible. Watching this film made me feel that humanity has a fighting chance, even when faced with a formidable alien foe, so space exploration is not something to fear, just because of the chance of encountering something better than us. Every marine is memorable in their own unique way and it's invigorating to watch the clashes and cuddles between the character's personalities.

The Mother of ALL Modern Action AND Horror Films,"I always attempt to give authentic and unbiased reviews on IMDb however this specific film has played such an integral role in my understanding, appreciation and evaluation of movies that it's difficult to remain completely objective.The truth is that ALIENS as well as numerous other offerings from James Cameron (The Abyss, T2, Titanic and Avatar) were all massive game
changers in the entertainment industry. Going to the Theatre to see a James Cameron Blockbuster was an awesome experience that has seemingly become a thing of the past nowadays (Avatar doesn't have the same authenticity or appeal).While I was only 9 years old when ALIENS was released and didn't see it in its entirety until several years later, I saw a very graphic portion of it at my local department store when it was released on laserdisc. The TV wall at Sears in the late 80's was my introduction to R rated movies and it had a profound impact on my young, sheltered psyche.ALIENS established James Cameron as The Foremost Pioneer of modern action, SciFi & horror genre! He also has an absolutely uncanny talent of delivering female heroines who are more compelling, capable and convincing than the male characters of any era. At a time when Schwarzenegger, Stallone, and Willis dominated Action Movies, I believe that Ridley, Vazquez, Mother Xenomorph and even Newt stand out as the most believable, realistic and unstoppable survivors of all.Males (real or fictional) are typically motivated by self preservation (or conquering evil in Action Films). Females (real or fictional) are generally motivated by Love and Compassion for others. Arnold and Bruce survived the predator and Hans Gruber but they ultimately did it for themselves. Ellen Ripley and Sarah Connor survived the Alien Queen and the Terminator but it's because they were driven to protect their children.In closing, ALIENS is the Standard for SciFi, Action and Horror films. The technology, innovations and imaginations of James Cameron have transformed both the industry and the culture.If you've never seen this one then I recommend starting with the first movie 'Alien' from 1979. It has some valuable insights on the tensions between Ripley and Bishop as well as her understanding of the severity of the situation.ALIENS is easily one of my all time top five Action films but ultimately it's ONE OF ONE and the impact it has had on multiple movie genres
(SciFi/Action/Horror/Drama) is immeasurable.95/100.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Excellent,"Cool actors directed well. Lots of mystery/suspence. And significant firepower. So much so that when i watch this thing i need to be wearing my belt full of holstered water guns full of green lake water. One time (when i was watching this) my cat jumped in front of the tv and it caused me to hold onto a turned on light bulb. Anyway: the actors that played the aliens were several types of animals, like pigeons and small cows. I learned that at my dicussion group of 135 people (we meet at dennys). One time in our group we were passing a red cloths hanger around taking turns responding to the question: what would you do on the last day of your life? Katie got passed the hanger and responded: ""on the last day of my life i'd like to build a living crow with my mouth.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the best monster movies,"I prefer James Cameron's ""Aliens"" (1986) to its predecessor, Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" (1979), mainly because the story is more compelling. People often say ""Aliens"" is more of an action film than ""Alien,"" but it's not a mindless action film and, in fact, the action doesn't even start until a FULL HOUR into its 2 hour and 18 minutes runtime (the extended cut runs about 16 minutes longer). The best horror/action movies take this route -- taking their time to build character and suspense before unleashing the horrific mayhem.Some complain about the screaming little girl, Newt, but -- hey -- she's a little girl and I think the situation calls for this sort of response. Others complain that Bill Paxton is too whiny as one of the Marines, but isn't this the way SOME people respond when facing overwhelming defeat -- even hardened militarists -- particularly by hideous extraterrestrial monsters? Another complaint is that the Marines are depicted as dumb, arrogant ""oo-rah"" types, but I used to be a Marine and this was the way the over-the-top ones acted and, furthermore, these are the kinds of Marines that would qualify for such a dangerous mission -- the (over)confident wackjobs who would get the job done and done right.The initial confrontation with the aliens at the hour mark is one of the most horrific sequences in cinematic history; and the Marines are thoroughly humbled. The rest of the film shows the surviving group literally sweating-it-out trying to figure out how to get off the planet alive where annihilating the creatures becomes a secondary objective.Ripley's motherly love for Newt is a good addition and it humanizes Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). The sequences with the alien Queen make for a dynamic and extended climax. Also, Lance Henriksen is notable as the ""artificial human"" and Paul Reiser as an effective love-to-hate quasi-villain.On the downside, the film is noticeably setbound, but that's par for the course for these types of sci-fi films, e.g. Star Trek. Another negative -- for me at least -- is that the film features no curvy babes, but this was the case with the first film as well, so it's to be expected. Besides, I think the female crew is more believable without someone like Juno Temple or Megan Fox aboard, lol.The bottom line is that ""Aliens"" is easily one of the greatest monster films of all time, surpassing even the first film in the series and leagues better than the next two.GRADE: A",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""It Won't Make Any Difference!""...","ALIENS is one of the few sequels that actually matches or surpasses the film that spawned it. Where Ridley Scott's ALIEN was more of a suspenseful monster movie, Director James Cameron chose to make his follow-up into a fast-paced film with the titular creatures causing even more mayhem.The story picks up several years after the incidents in the original, with a rescued Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) accompanying a team of space marines on a mission to the planet from the first film. It seems that something has caused a communication breakdown with a group of colonists there.The marines are all fully trained, but have no idea what they're getting into. Upon their arrival, a nearly non-stop firestorm ensues. As the title suggests, there are now multiple ""xenomorphs"" to contend with, as well as something even more dangerous that must be stopped at all costs.Cameron takes the sort of explosive action he used in THE TERMINATOR two years earlier, and ups the ante, creating a masterpiece of dynamic sci-fi in the process. Ripley transforms from her resourceful character in the first movie, into a warrior bent on protecting the sole survivor of this latest holocaust.As with ALIEN, when this film debuted there was nothing else like it, making it a seminal movie as well as a huge hit. A classic that still holds up after all these years...",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
How To Do A Sequel Right!,"James Cameron took over directing duties from Ridley Scott, and like the original, directs this with remarkable intensity and suspense, as Ripley is rescued from her hyper sleep, and later persuaded to return to the same alien planet where all that horror she left behind comes back multiplied, after a colony stumbles upon the same derelict ship, and comes into contact with the merciless alien creatures...A model on how to produce a sequel; continue the original, building on the plot without repeating it, while at the same time respecting the past, and putting your own stamp on things. Just like the first, this is extremely effective in story, character development, and excitement, building to an action-packed and satisfying climax.One of the finest sequels ever made!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
a good movie but not a masterpiece,"I loved this movie when it came back in 1986. Just as I loved Terminator and Terminator 2. But Aliens and Terminator 2 haven't really aged that well. Camerons direction is thin and too obvious. There's no depth in the movie that helps you keep the interest up when watching it a second or third time. There are some excellent action scenes in Aliens, that's Camerons real strength as a director. That's unfortunately not the case with the dialog sequences. They feel stiff and artificial. As long as the space marines run around and shout at each other it's not a huge problem, that is, as long as you find shouting marines interesting. The references to Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers are a bit too obvious, especially the focus on the ""space- borne infantry"" (or marines in this movie), ""the drop"" and the units tactics and the ""bug hunt"".If you haven't seen this movie it's of course a must see. But have in mind that it's also an overrated movie so you don't get disappointed.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"A lot of tense, scary fun","It's interesting to compare Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" to James Cameron's sequel. Both are extremely well made films, from world class directors. But each also reflects the very different sensibilities of the two. ""Alien"" is colder, more precise, more haunting and disturbing. ""Aliens"" is a thrill ride from start to end, faster paced, more muscular and energetic, less serious, and sloppier – in ways both good and bad - than it's progenitor.It sometimes pushes the emotions into the 'sappy' range, one of it's few flaws, along with a few big logic holes, and a couple of obvious twists. But the film-making is so confident, and downright fun that it becomes infectious, even if you try to resist it. It can make the 'gee- whiz' kid in you win out over the critical adult.The plot in some ways is a re-run of the first, but now instead of humans being helpless victims, they are Marines going to war with a creature they don't understand, and initially don't take seriously enough.There's also a nice feminist streak to the film, present in the original, but expanded on here. Not only is Sigourney Weaver's Ripley tougher and smarter than just about every male on display, but the most kick-ass of all the kick-ass Marines is also a woman (Jenette Goldstein in a terrific performance).I enjoyed Cameron's extended cut (his preferred version) on the blu-ray. The newer version didn't feel too long, but did feel more flowing and complete, giving us some important insights into Ripley's character. The blu-ray's image is terrific and very sharp, but that does tend to show up the crude nature of some of the early CGI work. I was also bothered by how much of the film seemed as if the dialogue had to be re-recorded in post production, the 'looped' dialogue somehow sounding a bit un-natural.If not a 'great' film, a very enjoyable, tense action blockbuster, back when solid acting, clever writing and high end craftsmanship were still important, even in a sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"It's cliche to say this, but Aliens really IS fantastic!","Aliens became the first of MANY sequels to 1979's surprise sci-fi-horror blockbuster: and in many space-opera fashions like Star Wars and Star Trek the sequels got bigger and crazier in terms of scope (at least with their initial sequels) and lore. The Alien franchise also became a MASSIVE multimedia titan that just continued to grow after this star-bound action-flick came to define 1986's place in action-cinema history, and still being a robust horror-thriller in the process too.The original Alien was definitely an eerie film that relied on its atmosphere instead of being a constant jump-scare fest (like many horror flicks nowadays), whereas Aliens makes you feel the presence of the Xenomorph as an all-encompassing threat that will not back down AT ALL, until its prey are either dead or impregnated by a dreaded face-hugger; and it's like a constant roller-coaster of 'OH SH! T' moments even with the gun-toting and flamethrowers keeping the terrifying monsters at bay on a 'Colony Planet' of smoke and cyberpunk-steel.Aliens showed that James Cameron's success with Terminator wasn't an accident; it showed that he knew the genre trappings of fast sci-fi-action and ran with it thanks to Alien being an unexpected success in 1979; so why not make an 'antithesis' to that film's deliberately restrained pacing and eeriness with one that's still scary but non-stop momentum of explosive action? Alien and Aliens are two of the strongest 'back-to-back' franchise films ever in terms of quality and legacy. Aliens is so damn good it leaves similar sequels of iconic films to shame; it's a standout sequel that dared to be different enough yet flaunt the same horror tropes in a fast-paced action flick for the ages.As far as the Alien films go, the first two movies really are as good as it gets! Sure the extended franchise has had its ups-and-downs, but all of those things owe their existence to two of the finest space adventures films ever made.Aliens is a 10/10 for IMDb. 5/5 stars. It's a blast that still appeals to today's blockbuster sensibilities easily.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Outstanding action!,"After having seen Alien, I wanted to know in what way Aliens would follow up. Not surprisingly, it goes by what sequels go for- it's bigger and louder. This isn't to say it's a negative thing at all. The film started with the standard formula for action films. As it is, I wasn't feeling it in its first half very much. It definitely sounded like a James Cameron film. We have some uninteresting characters, one specifically who is the clichéd ""masculine"" female. Cameron is a much better director than writer, which is the reason why he makes up for its flaws in its second half. The action pieces here are outstanding! I don't remember such a film with as beautifully set-up set designs and visual effects as here in a long time. The action here is, excuse me for it, but out-of-this-world. You can definitely see all of the amazing work put into building this world and then having that final climax take place.Overall, I was ready to say that this film is easily inferior to the first, but by the end I can only say it's a little inferior. Sure, it has a lot of the usual mediocre dialogue and characterization and a lot of the ""formulaic"" plot turns, but hey, it's so hard to really hold that against it because as it is, this is a great film. Now, is Alien 3 worth it?",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Good Action Packed Sequel.,"James Cameron's ""Aliens"" is the sequel to Ridley Scott's 1979 film ""Alien"". In that film, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) was the sole survivor of her spaceship's crew that was decimated by an alien. This film focuses on Ripley and her return to the planet from ""Alien"" where the alien eggs are located.After finally being found by The Company after floating aimlessly in space for many years, Ripley is horrified to discover that the planet from ""Alien"" has been colonised by humans (who have no clue that they share the planet with alien eggs). When The Company loses contact with the planet, they send a representative (Paul Reiser), a team of marines and Ripley to investigate. Upon their arrival, they find a terrified girl called ""Newt"" (Carrie Henn) who tells them what happened to the rest of the colony (see the title of the film).While not quite as good as the first film, ""Aliens"" still has a very satisfying plot. Whereas ""Alien"" focused on suspense, ""Aliens"" is an action movie. Moreover, as far as action movies go, this film will surely be rated highly among them if the audience buys the story. Here lies the problem with the plot: that it may not be entirely believable to all viewers. For instance, Ripley and Newt develop a sort of mother-daughter relationship that explains a critical decision taken towards the film's end. Those who do not believe the bonding was strong enough (myself included) will think the decision is ridiculous. Further, the plot does not properly explain why Ripley would ever want to go back to the alien planet. We know that the alien's image still haunts her dreams and for her to be rid of it she must see them eliminated, but is this really a sufficient reason? With those exceptions, the plot is still good and action-filled. Thankfully, as in the first film, there is a long period to build the story and characters before anything takes place.If one finds the Ripley/Newt relationship believable then Sigourney Weaver's performance is good, otherwise, it is ordinary, noted only for her strong female role. Paul Reiser and Michael Biehn can be enjoyable at times, but they do not have the skills to demonstrate the few complexities of their characters. Ms. Henn seems quite an annoying child actor whose job is to get into trouble. The most enjoyable performance comes from the foul-mouthed tough-guy, Private Hudson (Bill Paxton) who quickly turns into a frightened wimp after an alien encounter. Lance Henriksen also does a solid job as the android, Bishop.James Cameron's direction is this film's highlight. Cameron obviously seems to have a knack for the science-fiction/action genre as he demonstrated in The Terminator (also starring Biehn). If there is one flaw, it is his overuse of hordes of aliens, which takes away the mystique the alien had in the first film and makes the creatures seem more vulnerable.Visually the film looks decent. There are still tight claustrophobic sets and dark lighting that add to the feel of the film. The models used are not as convincing however, so that the first film that was released seven years earlier actually looks better.Overall, ""Aliens"" is a good action movie and a good sequel that can actually be enjoyed without seeing the original film. Actually, viewers who have not yet seen the brilliant ""Alien"" may enjoy this film more if they see it first.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Perfect Movie,"Another movie that deserves a perfect 10 stars. The real miracle of this movie is the character development, begun by Ridley Scott and perfected by James Cameron. In a few scenes we are introduced to the heart and soul of the soldier, of Ripley, of Hicks and Bishop. Why do we feel such a connection to them, so immediately, so intensely and so experientially? This is because of Cameron, and his relationship with the actors. Remember Al Matthews (As----es and elbows people!). Right now I'm beginning to think that it is the relationship, the connection, the attunement, between director and actor, that makes or breaks a great movie. Scott and Cameron understood this, and made excellent movies as a result. These days I see so many directors and actors making the same mistakes over and over again, not seeing eye to eye, and failing miserably. When will they learn? No film school can teach this. It's innate, and the stuff that makes a great director, such as Scorcese, Spielberg and Cameron. It's maddening to me, why the power of presence, unconditional positive regard and strength based direction is not taught in schools. Eric.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Don't believe the hype, just another boring sequel","I know that this film is widely revered, but for me it is little more than another disappointing sequel. While its predecessor is a work of art, Aliens feels much more like a cheap and desperate Hollywood money-spinner. Sigourney Weaver, so brilliant in the original, is turned into a corny superhero complete with ridiculous plot armour. The obligatory scene of her in underwear at the end is a fair reflection of this film's neediness. The rest of the crew are laughably one-dimensional, particularly when compared with the brilliant cast of Alien. The addition of the little girl and her incessant screaming is another cheap ploy with no purpose other than to appease the popcorn-munchers. And the aliens themselves lose all intrigue, popping up left, right and centre to kill or be killed as the plot demands. The overall look of the film takes a backward step as well- the sets look cheap and the special effects are inferior to the original.Honestly, there was no need for this movie other than to make money. And did I mention its unfeasibly long? I couldn't wait for it to end, but every time I thought it was over another pointless alien would appear or the little girl would nearly die (even though I knew full well she wouldn't) or Weaver would have to perform some contrived act of badassery that I couldn't really care less about.

The perfect sci-fi/horror film,"I watched Aliens tonight again for maybe the 50th time and just before it started I decided to list my top ten films of all time.Now I will add at this point I'm a 50 year old English man who loves his scotch!Before the film started it was in my top 10 and because it's been a few years since I had watched it I was interested to find out if it was as good as I remembered.In fact the opening scene and soundtrack absolutely confirmed it.... Maybe it was taking me back to my youth but I was engaged like the first time. And is that not the sign of a classic?I cannot sit through a full film these days without being distracted, this inevitably means I turn off without 'getting to the end!'It's a sad state of affairs! Is it because I'm older? Or are films just not that good anymore??My most memorable experiences in the last 10 years are films I've watched with my daughters growing up!Don't worry they were old enough but films like Seven and Fight Club we all loved.Unfortunately they aren't into sci-fi but love horror.Which is a shame because Aliens crosses both boundaries. Sigourney Weaver as Ripley is a class act with flawless support actors around her... including the very funny (at times) Bill Paxton playing Hudson... who is one of the most likeable characters you will ever see.Alien is raw and brilliant but I guess is niche.

A few details that caught my eye,"First of all, the pilot in the spaceship wears sunglasses and the sergeant lights a cigar as soon as he wakes up. I've never seen anything more American :))Great graphics and very original content for 1986.Of course, I'm not saying this to disparage Ridley Scott, but James Cameron's intervention in the incident really gave extremely positive results. His unique style is immediately evident. One of the first and most important indicators is that he shot a film that was brilliant and ahead of its time. The second obvious indicator is the long duration of the movie! Jokes aside, no matter how high-quality and gripping the movie was, I sometimes felt like it was kept too long. I don't mean this in the sense of ""he fainted from boredom."" It was only the second movie of Alien that we got to know the characters and started to feel something about them. The first one seemed too short. It was a film without depth, which told what it wanted to say right away. This time, we have a more sedate, slower-paced, and at the same time more fast-paced film. In my opinion, it is one of the best sequels that should be included in their lists. The finale may never come, but the movie does not leave you staring blankly during this time. There is constant adventure and action. Naturally, Ripley comes to the fore. Especially those who love science fiction should not miss it. Of course, we said it was ahead of its time, but no one should expect today's technology, we are talking about 1986. Cameron teaches how to achieve maximum efficiency with the material and staff at hand. As he has done in many of his other works, he has an innovative and different performance that manages to go one step ahead. All the actors are successful. ""Aliens"" is one of the movies that I won't go back to watch in the future, but I enjoyed watching it. There is an opinion that the bar has been lowered for the continuation of the series, so I'm curious too, I'll take a look. It's an important movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Great sequel - but not the greatest,"I think Alien (1979) is a perfect movie, and the Nostromo is probably one of the scariest locations in a horror movie ever. Every corridor, every room, every sound and every little detail on board has an ambiance that is unparalelled and completely unique. It's a world that makes every other movie feel tame in comparison, it's a movie that makes me scared of what people are capable of doing with cinema.A sequel to this movie with a larger scope and budget has every right to be incredible, and I had every right to expect that.Unfortunately, Aliens is a movie that doesn't really work for what it should be. Where Alien is spooky and surreal, Aliens is bombastic and goes in guns blazing. Where Alien is mysterious and uncanny, in Aliens the characters are upbeat, cheesy and never gloomy.It's ultimately the opening scenes where these differences really shine. In Alien the conversation between the characters around the dining table on the Nostromo is gloomy and you can't even hear the conversation, making you feel as YOU just awoke from hyper sleep and are still zoned out. In Aliens, the marines are joking around, flirting, and it all feels like Top Gun. This sets the expectations. The mood is already set and it's hard for the movie to actually be scary, and it never gets scary.This movie is still a great blockbuster, and the reasons for it have been stated countless times, and I do not feel the need to repeat them. What I especially love is the world building. This might seem weird when I've criticized it, but it's truly great and I would easily recommend it.83/100.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

This one is more action packed, dark humored, and thrilling.

Makes the first movie look bad,"As a person not growing up on these movies I have a lot more to question than people feeling nostalgic while writing their reviews. To start off with, who came with the brilliant idea to make the second movie to be named Alien-s.While I really liked the original script for aliens I felt like the original movie ruined some of the good stuff about the close to perfect draft script. Its a good read for those who have not read it.To write a review about Alien 2 we must not forget the things that were good about the first movie and what expectations we came with about the second. While the first movie is more like a horror film the shift is for me a bit too drastic. James Cameron surely did a good job turning it into an action but it feels a lot like the ground principles are ruined in the first movie after watching the second. For example, you will you never really appreciate the first movie as much as you did after watching the second. Cameron ruins the tension Ridley Scott fulfills in the first one. By making a single alien almost invincible on the mining rig we se the main characters with ease shoot bullets and kill hundreds of them in the second movie.While the story of Camerons movie is closer to the heart does it not have the same originality as I feel that a followup should have. A movie bound to succeed at the box-office but isn't as engaging as I believe it was 50 years ago.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Aliens have returned in spectacular fashion!,"Aliens avoids the all-too common fate of sequels, to live forever in the shadow of their predecessors, and usually for good reason. It is especially common for sequels of enormously successful movies to fall flat, particularly in the horror and science fiction genres (remember The Exorcist II?). The first sequel to Ridley Scott's spectacular 1979 film, which set the standard for science fiction for years to come, is placed into the capable hands of James Cameron, who clearly takes some knowledge from Halloween director John Carpenter. Once this movie gets going, it goes full speed and doesn't let you rest for two and a half hours.The movie starts off exactly at the same point where the first movie left off. Well, 57 or so years later, but otherwise the same. Ripley has been in deep sleep and drifting aimlessly in space, and was discovered, as one man describes it to her, by dumb luck. She wakes up to a series of significant and inevitable shocks. Her daughter, whom she had promised that she would be home from her mission, the one from the last movie, has grown up and died an old woman. It's a strange scene to see Ripley looking at a picture of her daughter, now decades older than her own mother.It's not long before Ripley learns that the planet on which they found the strange craft with the alien eggs in it is now inhabited by an entire subculture of families, living on the planet in order to cultivate the atmosphere so that it will be breathable for more people to go live there. Needless to say, she's not entirely impressed with the idea of families living on the planet where the aliens came from, but these people have a lot of money invested in populating that planet, so no one's going to call off the whole project based on the ramblings of some woman who has been floating in space for five decades. And there you have the premise for the movie, already having justified its existence and separated itself from its predecessor enough so that it owns the rest of its own plot. Many good sequels still only tell another story under the same basic plot outline or involving the same characters. In this one, only one character remains from the original story, and the rest of it is simply a continuation of the original story. James Cameron later went on to develop something of a reputation for making good sequels.Alien fans can rejoice because they made another movie but did not sell out. There's a big risk in successful movies being followed up with a sequel just for the money, you see it all the time  Predator, Texas Chainsaw, Darkman (Durant survived that helicopter crash???) etc. Aliens starts right off knowing that it's not wise to throw in another alien and film it chasing and killing people. The movie starts out with Ripley facing serious consequences for official misconduct for that expensive ship that she destroys. She has to convince the board that she had no other choice at the same time as she has to credibly explain the deaths of her entire crew and convince them that those families living on that planet, LV-426, are in grave danger. Not only are they skeptical of her story, she's a suspect in a criminal investigation.Suddenly, all contact is lost with LV-426, and Ripley's story begins to take on a little merit. They offer her a clean slate if she'll accompany their military forces to the planet to check out the situation. She agrees as long as they are going there to destroy the alien, not capture and study it. There is an interesting new crew in the movie, except in this case Ripley has to convince them of her reason for being there. She's not combat trained like they are, but she knows what they're up against, and it's not until they learn about that that they begin to realize how important she is to their mission.My favorite is Bill Paxton's character, Pvt. Hudson, a tough-talking, loudmouth showoff who is reduced to a whining baby, just about wetting himself with fear when the group is confronted with the alien. He was the toughest talker and the loudest mouth going into the mission, but the first to give up hope on himself and the entire crew. This is one of the ways that the story develops unique personalities, people that we can identify, if not identify WITH, just enough to care about what happens to them. And in a movie like Aliens, it's very important that the audience cares what happens to the characters.When they get to the island, it's not long before they encounter a young girl named Newt, who has survived when the rest of the planet was decimated by the aliens, and doubts the crews ability to fight a growing number of aliens with such a small force, and Ripley takes her under her arm. Ripley becomes the mother that Newt no longer has, and Newt becomes the daughter that Ripley no longer has, and it sets an interesting tone for the rest of the movie. The aliens are trying to protect their offspring, and Ripley is essentially trying to do exactly the same thing.One of the things that makes the Alien movies so successfully tense is the setting. They are enclosed within a ship in outer space, trapped with a much more powerful creature. If both sides were unarmed, the aliens would do away with the humans in minutes. Cameron uses this setting to its full potential, employing motion sensors to heighten tension and using spaces in the ship, like the space above the ceiling, to allow the aliens to get extremely close to the humans, even while the humans are watching their movement on their monitors and wondering why the monitor shows them in the very room but they can't see them yet.In another lesson that Cameron seems to have taken from John Carpenter, he keeps the aliens mostly out of sight during the movie, feeling that the less we see them the more menacing they become and remain. He's exactly right about this, too. It maintains a sense of mystery and danger surrounding the aliens that transcends simply their viciousness and obvious physical superiority, and always keeps the viewer straining to see more. But like the crew, we know very little about these creatures other than how deadly they are. Oh, and if you want to see what happens when a director doesn't understand the need to keep the killer in the shadows, watch Halloween II.This is, unfortunately, the last movie in the quadrilogy before it makes a precipitous creative turn downward with the sub-par second and third sequels, but Alien and Aliens are spectacular enough that they fill the void left by their two predecessors. Two such powerful movies may make it even more difficult to take that the good ones seem to be over, but these two remain landmarks. Also keep your eye out for (among several other Cameron regulars) Jenette Goldstein, a lesser known actress whose impressive versatility becomes clear when comparing her character in Aliens with her character, say, in Titanic!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best example of Bigger is Better,"There are several ways to approach making a sequel to a successful genre film. One of them is ""bigger is better"". James Cameron's 1986 Aliens might be the textbook example of how to do that.The movie follows so many of the same basic plot points and character models as the first that it could almost be called a remake. A group of working class people land on LV-426 where they are attacked by aliens, killing everyone but a few. The few fight back, thinking they've succeeded before a final fight erupts on the escape ship. Having won, everyone goes to sleep in freezer pods for the long flight home.I detail that not as a criticism, but only observationally. Stories work because of execution not because of basic plot details, and Aliens is executed marvelously.Ripley, having survived her first experience with the xenomorph on the Nostromo, has drifted through space for 57 years while in cryo-sleep. She gets picked up and returned to the Company who nurse her back to health and debrief her about her experience. No one believes her experiences, though there's enough interest to get the colonists on LV-426 to check out the coordinates Ripley supplied. Of course, the Company loses contact with the colony immediately afterwards and they have to go in. Ripley gets roped in and tags along with a group of Colonial Marines. They find the colony deserted save Newt, a little girl hiding in ducts, before all hell breaks loose and the xenomorphs come calling, tearing apart the marines one by one.You can see the ""bigger is better"" mentality running through that. The setting is bigger (a colony instead of a small ship). The group of people is bigger. The type of people are bigger than life (space marines versus space truckers). The weapons are bigger (rifles and grenades versus makeshift prods and flamethrowers). The number of aliens is bigger (one versus many). There's even the introduction of a new type of xenomorph, a much bigger Queen. The film embraces bigger in every way, and in doing so it fundamentally changes the nature of the horror that was present in the first film.Cameron was smart enough to understand that by changing the scope of the threat (from one alien to many) he was changing the type of horror present. The first film was essentially a claustrophobic survival horror film. Some of those elements are still present in the sequel, but they're far less prominent. The sequel is still a horror film, but it's changed subgenres from the haunted house to an action horror film. That change is perfectly cast for the change in scale of the threat.It also makes sense from a practical perspective. In the first, the xenomorph was untouchable, but that was an element of the crew's unpreparedness. Sending in marines with big guns changes the relationship between the characters and the threat. The aliens could have been made invincible, but that might have been too far in the suspension of disbelief department, so increasing their number was probably the most logical choice. Swarms of aliens that you can't see until it's too late replace a single entity that could be around every corner. That also requires another extension of the aliens in the form of a new type of creature, hopefully bigger, and the queen fits the bill exactly. She's huge and terrifying.Moving on to thematic material, Aliens actually continues Ripley's journey instead of just repeats it. If Alien was about the destruction of a family, Aliens is about recovering from trauma by forming a new family. Ripley can't sleep through the night because she's so consumed by nightmares of her past experience. It's the reason she goes on the mission to begin with. She thinks that by confronting what hurt her, she may free herself of her own fear. Finding Newt, the little girl, gives her a purpose beyond her own survival. Newt becomes Ripley's daughter (a connection made more potent through a deleted scene that's included in the Special Edition of Ripley's actual daughter cursing Ripley for leaving her alone her whole life), and Corporal Hicks takes on the mantle of father and husband to the pair.The final act of the film is entirely predicated on the newly formed family being threatened and torn apart. An alien grabs Newt and takes her to another part of the colony to be impregnated with another alien. Ripley has to go in herself, leaving Hicks behind in their escape ship because of his injuries. It becomes one mother (Ripley) against another mother (the Queen), a symmetry between the two characters that adds an extra thematic oomph to the final act. It plays with much more character that way instead of just bad assed woman going up against a large creature.The real final fight on the Sulaco where Ripley gets in her mech suit and has, essentially, a fist fight with the Queen is one of the most gratifying and visceral special effects driven fights in popular film. It's mother against mother after Ripley destroyed all of the Queen's children. The fight is perfectly filmed and completely believable, giving Ripley the kind of physical advantage that is both believable and satisfying.The movie's just pure action horror entertainment that's very smart about how it uses its characters to establish themes that feed into the terror. It's bigger, louder, and with many more explosions, and it's probably the best example of bigger is better filmmaking.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent,"Another all-time classic film that I enjoy every time that I watch it. It is the perfect compliment to Alien (1979). The first film was a claustrophobic suspenseful horror film and this is an intense action film. They are both equally entertaining. The vast majority of the special effects are convincing and realistic, my only gripe is the rear-screen projection as it looks washed-out compared to the foreground. There is so much truly stunning cinematography. Sound design continues the epic memorable trend set by the first film. The most memorable being the pulse rifle sounds. Characters are memorable and interesting except maybe Newt who can get a little annoying but overall that is a minor gripe. There are some truly awesome moments in the story that is perfectly told. The special edition is better than the theatrical version but it is very long! I love the action and evolution of the series. It is exciting and fun. I do usually prefer suspense to action. I loved most of the old-school ambitious effects. More action than horror, not a bad thing, very good action at that.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the few times where I like the sequel more than the original,"Aliens is one of the few instances where I enjoy the sequel more than the original. This film fires up the fast-paced action almost right from the beginning and delivers some truly terrifying moments. Plus, the creature effects still look fantastic even though it's been decades since this movie was made. Alien was an iconic horror film, and many people thought a sequel was a bad idea, yet Aliens somehow managed to build the xenomorph mythology instead of destroying it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Cameron continues and wins the game,"The horror film, which for me was ""Alien"", got a great sequel. The xenomorph universe has been replenished with a great story, in which the main character has also returned. The film was shot by another director, the genre changed, the world was revealed from a new angle, and the intensity of the action became a couple of levels higher.The picture as a whole has changed its focus. If the first film frightened the viewer with an extraterrestrial unknown organism that systematically destroyed people on the ship, then the second film raised the stakes, showed the genesis of xenomorphs and demonstrated how interesting a fight between an elite squad of commandos and ruthless alien creatures can be. All this complemented the thriller with vivid action scenes, which undoubtedly benefited the project.It was nice to see Sigourney Weaver in the lead role again. She is convincing, trying to explain to lawmakers that the alien race is deadly, fighting for her life, the life of the Marines and, of course, the little girl she recently met. Emotions are conveyed simply gorgeous. This is one of the best roles of an actress in my opinion.Other famous actors also appear in the film. Michael Bean, Bill Paxton, Lance Henrikson - they are remembered for their roles. Bean is a brave soldier. In principle, such roles are suitable for him, because he knows how to win over himself, it is written on his face that he is a purely positive hero-savior. Paxton appears in the image of a bad soldier, who in fact turns out to be a smudge at all. Bill was so successful in this image that to this day the actor causes me some negativity, reminding me of that hero. Henrikson appears as an android who helps people. An insightful machine that teaches viewers that human life is very important.The picture of the film is quite gloomy. It is understandable. The action simply takes place on a distant planet under the cover of night. But this atmosphere of darkness, wind, horror sneaks the viewer. It seems as if there is no way out. And for many, it turns out that way. I really liked the xenomorphs. In this film, we were shown them in all their glory, approaching the disclosure of the image of strangers with all responsibility. From the technical side, everything was created perfectly.The intensity of the action results in the expected final confrontation between the man and the Queen. A very spectacular fight, which you expect the whole movie, it really is an ornament of ""Strangers"". A life-and-death struggle. A fight that was staged with attention to all the details.The result is for me. Sequels tend to be inferior to the originals. This is a kind of movie rule. You can count on your fingers those paintings that have become more successful and better than their predecessors. So I boldly refer ""Strangers"" to such films. It is richer, more watchable, deeper, more informative. James Cameron and his team managed to present a legendary movie, which still looks very decent today.9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The most stupidest movie saga of all time.,"I never really liked the Alien saga.  The first one was a slow boring piece of celluloid.  The second film Aliens was a stupid 80's action corporate movie built to cater the dumb tastes of stupid moviegoers.  The third movie, Alien 3, however, was a stylistic and dark film.  I was finally relieved when the protagonist killed herself at the end of the film, because I was getting sick of seeing her or her pathetic acting attempts.  Alien:Resurrection was just so bad that it made the first three films seem good.  Why don't you people just drop the alien films and get a life?

"Not Like The First of the Series, But Still Very Good","I have only seen the first two of the ""Alien"" series, so my comments on both films are within this context. Despite being a sequel with a time gap that cannot be considered wide (1979 to 1986), I found the two films quite different in both style and essence: Whereas Ridley Scott in ""Alien"" made a typical thriller, James Cameron came up with a movie in which the focus was much more on the action and less on suspense.In ""Alien"", we saw one by one the crew members of Nostromo getting killed by the mysterious and cryptic alien in a slow and painful pace (until the last scenes at least, where the tempo goes up). In ""Aliens"", the theme is completely different: Ripley (Weaver) is persuaded to return to the planet, which has been colonized by humans who are unaware of the lethal danger, and who have now faced the wrath and terrorizing of the aliens who inhabit there. The Company also sends a team of Space Marines with heavy fire power (with Ripley acting as their adviser), in order to clean up the place. As soon as the squad lands onto the unfriendly territory, the action begins: The aliens are tough nuts, and a devastating war between the two species takes place.Contrary to the first film, ""Aliens"" is full of overwhelming sci-fi action, putting the film in the same category as say, the Star Wars saga (although the scenes in ""Aliens"" are much more brutal and horrific). Moreover, although ""Alien"" was a much more genuine and pioneer film, in ""Aliens"" I didn't get this feeling (although the fact that it was a sequel is in part responsible for this).This does not mean that ""Aliens"" is not good. On the contrary, it provides us with vivid action, solid performances, stunning effects (for the 80's standards), and a very good direction. Yet, I can't help but give it a slightly lower grade than the superb ""Alien"". Overall mark 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Prime example of a sequel done right - A sci-fi horror masterpiece,"'Aliens' is the relentless action-packed sequel to the 1979 Ridley Scott classic 'Alien' that extends the premise of the first film by taking it into exciting new directions while at the same time it manages to build upon the legacy of the first film without diminishing it. From its fantastic storyline, sprawling locations, high octane action and the sheer amount of xenomorphs on screen, this sequel is bigger than its predecessor in every way possible which makes a more than worthy follow-up that's equally as iconic.The Plot = Awakening after a long hibernation after surviving the Nostromo incident, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is sent back to the planet LV-426 to establish contact with a terraforming colony but finds herself battling the Alien Queen and her offspring.There will always be that debate on which movie is better 'Alien' or 'Aliens', and there's perfectly reasonable arguments on both accounts. What you can't deny is that this entry is simply one of the best sequels of all-time, no scratch that it's easily the greatest horror sequel of all-time. A shocking combination of action, sci-fi, horror and even drama that creates a powerful experience that doesn't let up until the end credits. The direction by James Cameron is outstanding as he certainly puts his signature stamp all over the production as he not expands the universe but transports you to a frightening and lonely new world with an intense atmosphere with plenty of nerve-racking suspense and terror, along with some spectacular action set pieces with plenty of raw emotion that messes with your mind and will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout.The visual effects, set designs and cinematography are all incredible here and adds a layer of class and sophistication to the production. The aliens themselves while retaining the look and horror of the original design, but here they have a different interpretation by acting more animalistic and its terror comes from its numbers. The alien queen herself is something truly to behold.The performances here are outstanding with Sigourney Weaver well and truly coming into her own in this iconic action heroine role and an excellent protagonist for the ages with real human emotions and she's the key reason why this franchise became a success in the first place. The rest of the cast are also excellent with Michael Biehn giving an amazing and realistic portrayal of the cool calm and collected Hicks. Bill Paxton gives a fun and memorable performance as Hudson and is absolutely perfect for this role, Jenette Goldstein gives a fantastic performance as the stone faced and heroic Vasquez, Lance Hendrickson shines as the robot Bishop.Overall 'Aliens' is a prime example of a sequel done right and dare I say it another firm sci-fi horror masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant sequel,"Aliens is James Cameron at his best in this very ambitious and action packed sequel to Ridley Scott's classic Alien. There are certain aspects of the film that don't come off as well as the first one. Such as the horror elements and HR Giger's superior design of the alien. However, James Cameron is an insane talent and brought his vision to the screen with high efficiency. Siguorney Weaver returns again as Ripley and delivers an outstanding performance that is vulnerable, intelligent and tough. It was impressive enough to get a nomination for best actress that year.(which was pretty much unheard of for sci fi, action and horror, genres the academy usually ignores) There are also some iconic and very memorable performances from Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Lance Hendrickson and Jenette Goldstein. Aliens has a dark tone and packs a mean punch with heavy doses of action. Aliens blend the genres of horror, action, drama and science fiction well. James Cameron is a guy who is a jack of all trades in film and also as a director and storyteller knows what he wants, as well as how to best achieve it. So, with the aid of his very talented crew the f/x, set designs, camera-work and editing are all top notch. Aliens is a great sequel and a classic that in the sci fi/action realm is tough to beat.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mother of All Battles,"Aliens, directed by James Cameron, is a perfect example of how to expand on a successful concept while maintaining the heart of what made the original so iconic. As a direct sequel to Ridley Scott's Alien, Cameron masterfully blends science fiction, action, and horror into a high-octane thrill ride that raises the stakes and delivers a powerful emotional core. The film follows Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) as she returns to the alien-infested planet, this time with a team of Colonial Marines, to rescue a colony of survivors and confront the terrifying creatures once again. Aliens is a flawless mix of suspense, action, and psychological depth, solidifying its place as one of the greatest sequels ever made.Sigourney Weaver gives an unforgettable performance as Ripley, bringing depth and complexity to her character as she evolves from a survivor to a fierce protector. Weaver's portrayal of Ripley's vulnerability, strength, and maternal instincts is one of the key reasons why the film resonates so strongly. The supporting cast, particularly Michael Biehn as Hicks and Carrie Henn as Newt, add further emotional weight, with their chemistry adding a human touch to the otherwise terrifying experience. The relationships between the characters deepen the stakes, making the action sequences even more compelling.Cameron's direction is nothing short of brilliant, transforming Aliens from a horror film into a thrilling action-packed experience without losing the tension that made Alien so effective. The pacing is impeccable, with moments of intense action balanced by quieter, suspenseful scenes that allow the horror to breathe. The film's practical effects and set design are stunning, from the terrifying Xenomorphs to the claustrophobic corridors of the colony; each detail adds to the immersive and dread-filled atmosphere. The iconic alien queen, revealed in the film's final act, is a masterful creation that amplifies the stakes of the story.The themes of motherhood, survival, and the consequences of corporate greed elevate Aliens beyond its genre. Cameron builds on the foundation laid by Alien, expanding the world without losing sight of the core elements that made the original so impactful. The film's exploration of Ripley's personal trauma and her evolving role as a protector adds emotional depth that sets it apart from many other action films. The climactic showdown between Ripley and the alien queen remains one of the most iconic and thrilling moments in film history.In conclusion, Aliens is a flawless sequel that builds on its predecessor while delivering an action-packed, emotionally resonant story. Sigourney Weaver's powerhouse performance, Cameron's direction, and the unforgettable visuals make Aliens one of the greatest science fiction films of all time and a must-watch for fans of the genre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Better Than the First, But Still Flawed","While Aliens improves on the first film in some ways, it still suffers from questionable character decisions, though thankfully there are fewer outright idiotic ones this time.

His calm and logical presence contrasts sharply with the chaos surrounding him, and he's a refreshing addition to the story.That said, some of the character choices still defy common sense. For example, when a man finds the alien ship, he doesn't even consider taking his family to safety before exploring it-an absolutely baffling decision. These kinds of moments remind you that while the film is entertaining, it's far from a masterpiece.Overall, it's an improvement over the first film, and I can say I actually liked it, but it still falls short of greatness.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Great Disappointment,"After watching this sequel, the best thing that I can say about ""Aliens"" is that it did have some interesting plot turns and some imaginative special effects. The figure of the Alien Queen was especially well done.But with all that said, the best way to describe this film would be- Disappointing.After the suspense filled story that was the original, with its excellent character development and well-cast ensemble of performers, this sequel falls way short. Instead of people the audience can identify with, we get a group of comic book caricatures. What was a masterpiece of Science Fiction suspense is turned into just another multiple car crash music video movie for 14 year olds. The film begins with a believable plot line, but soon degenerates into comic book silliness. Director James Cameron apparently wanted this to be another variation on the ""Terminator"" theme. And as a former U. S. Marine myself, I find this ""Colonial Marine"" business to be almost insulting. The characters in the platoon all seem to be futuristic stereotypes from Hollywood war films.

Ripley is asked to go back to the planet she escaped from to help settlers who have disappeared. Bad idea Ripley.Together with a bucket load of marines they arrive back at the planet only to find no survivors except for a young girl called Newt. This is where the real fun starts as soon the marines are reduced to a few, BISHOP (Henricksen), a synthetic robot, HICKS (Paxton), who spends most of the time whining, VASQUEZ (Goldstein), the all action gal, HUDSON (Biehn), what we would call the hero, and GORMAN who is in charge but injured. Luckily the nasty Burke doesn't last much longer and it's now a race against time to escape.It's not just the action scenes that make this one of the best films of the decade, it's the dialogue between the characters, especially the scenes with Ripley and Newt.

"It was a 10 in 1986, but in 2022 it now seems closer to a 9","Alien is one of my very favorite films. I think it a work of art. When I heard that a sequel was occurring, I was not a happy camper, but James Cameron did a clever thing by following a methodical, deadly serious solemn film using the same main character to make a rip-roaring action film. I was stunned at how good it was even though it contained much lighter and at times sillier characters. Sigourney Weaver is a terrific heroine once again and of the newbies, Bill Paxton stands out as the most welcome. This is one terrific and fun action film that's a little creaky in the special effects departments after 36 years, though not the creatures themselves, and unlike the original, some of the characters seem a tad silly now and then. All the rest of the films that contain the Alien creatures are a must to avoid, though the third in this series had a strong premise, but it ultimately did not work primarily due to it being too dark and ugly with a frenetic, unclear ending by a first time film director. In all of film history, has there ever been a film series that started off with directors of the caliber of Ridley Scott, James Cameron and David Fincher?! I think not.

A Spectacular Sequel Betraying its Roots,"»Aliens« is a pretty solid sequel to the sci-fi nightmare that was Ridley Scott's »Alien«, but I can't help but feel that James Cameron's effort is overrated. True, »Aliens« rocks as a grade A hollywood actioner. There are some amazing set pieces. Come to think of it, the whole movie is one gigantic set piece. It's entertaining and suspensful as hell.And ... that's about all I can say about it. »Aliens« doesn't give me much to think about, although it has so much more plot than the original. This movie is the definition of a blockbuster: well made and engaging, but ultimatively empty and calculated. What escpecially bugs me is the new character Newt. This sweet little girls serves one purpose and one purpose only: Making Ellen Ripley into a mother. Throughout the whole movie Cameron tries to give Ripley a new family. That's interesting enough (altough it may rise some feministic concerns), but it's handled in a painfully heavy-handed way.Gone is the artful agitation of »Alien«, gone its originality and openness. It's clear that a lot of effort went into »Aliens«, but its emotional core is lacking. It's a worthwhile watch anyway, I'd be a fool to deny the raw power this movie has. It just doesn't feel like an »Alien« flick. Even less so than the much-maligned fourth installment by Jean-Pierre Jeunet.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

This is probably my favorite movie in the series,"Aliens (1986) is currently available on Tubi and tells the tale of our friend Ripley waking up from the first film 50+ years later. She is asked to accompany a military group on a mission to investigate a vessel that may have hostiles. She reluctantly goes and shortly after arriving she will wish she never had...This movie is directed by James Cameron (Terminator 2) and stars Sigourney Weaver (Ghostbusters), Bill Paxton (Feailty), Lance Henriksen (Pumpkinhead), Paul Reiser (Beverly Hills Cop) and Cynthia Dale Scott (Night of the Demons). The storyline for this picture is very good and contains many more scenes with the aliens and face-huggers than the first picture. The shootouts and special effects are excellent. The cast are well selected and the dialogue between characters is hilarious and entertaining. The space elements, space craft, weapons and special effects are incredibly well done. The conclusion is awesome and they do a great job of having Ripley emerge as a hero in this film - both in rescuing troops, coming up with plans, and of course her matchup vs the Queen to close the film. This is probably my favorite movie in the series that I'd score an easy 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"For a movie that feels like absoloutely -everything- had to be okayed by some Network Suit in order to sell stuff, this is Amazing.","I still love Aliens, I know it's a 'pick one or the other' type deal and I certainly pick the first.Everything about this movie from it's plot development, to the character arcs, designs, set designs, music all screams 'for sale' we're gonna make action figures, video/board games, records, books, just about anything to $ell $ell $ell outta this one, And Guess What?-----------------Its Still Freaking Amazing!I just think about the Stress that Cameron and Weaver were under from the executives to make everything as commercial as anything in history ever has been, and still make artisically, creatively the best movie that they could, and I realize that there was no way this movie could have been any better.It might just be the best sequel ever, and is certainly just as inspired, just as influential as the first, and is still a damn good movie.

"Aliens is close behind its predecessor in atmosphere, and surpasses it in theme and emotion","Aliens is a very worthy sequel to a sci-fi icon. Alien was a pure, uncompromising sci-fi thriller with no scene or moment wasted. To that end, it's also more of an experience being in that setting and feeling the fear and uncertainty the characters do more so than a film with a lot for the audience to think about. Alien achieves its aim admirably, but for my tastes Aliens manages to even improve upon it. We don't get quite the same level of nervousness and claustrophobia here, and some of the action scenes feel a bit more shoot em up than I'd like, but Aliens more than makes up for it. I do think Aliens is comparable to Alien in how realistic the space mission is, in the excellent alien design, and in the general plot arc and rising tension throughout. The thrills are definitely still present - especially when Newt and Ripley are together and you can see their fear for each other, I was on the edge of my seat. On top of that, Aliens has plenty on its mind. Sigourney Weaver is absolutely fantastic here - the script is great and we feel a deep connection to her journey. Thematically, greed is explicitly explored, and I liked the way human arrogance was considered early in the film, but the omnipresent themes are motherhood and survival. Ripley clearly feels a deep connection to Newt and feels responsible for protecting her. At the same time, the aliens are hyperefficient in doing the only thing they care about: surviving, along with their children. Female roles and trusting women in general is crucial here, as the commanders are quick to write off Ripley as crazy and delusional at the start of the film. It also takes far too long for the crew to start respecting Ripley as a key member. Interestingly, they all respect Vasquez, but that's because the way she proves herself is the same masculine way men prove themselves: through physical prowess and bravado. Ripley has a different type of strength, but it is obvious by the end of the film that she is the most resourceful and hardiest of them all.On the subject of arrogance, the big difference in premise here is that Ripley already knows what they're like and is warning everyone - the Marines are coming in with fully stocked firepower, unlike the team in Alien. Despite their expectation, everyone in the crew expects it to be a walk in the park; they can't fathom the fact that they could fail or meet a challenge greater than them, and when they do, many of them crumble. Alien is a more pure experience, but Aliens left me with much more to think about when the credits rolled.The other thing Aliens does very well is establish emotional connection. I loved Newt as a character here, and it's a very strong child performance by Henn. As I mentioned, Weaver is exceptional in the lead. The cast of characters may seem to have some stereotypes in there, but I can also appreciate the way Cameron turns away from some tropes, such as having the AI be helpful here, and the turn of Burke is very well done. It's really the connection between Newt and Ripley that makes us root so hard for them to survive, along with a bit of appreciation for Hicks as a brave and open minded leader. I can see why many would like Alien more, and obviously everything that Cameron does well here is on the back of the massive success that Scott created, but Aliens was a really fun, thrilling watch for me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Be afraid be very afraid ,o wait wrong film, but still true.","Aliens is one of the best sequels in film history for it took the Lovecraft inspired terror for : 1) continued to the horror elements almost excellently and 2) made it a pitch perfect action-film with awesome scenes, effects and many more!The film takes place sixty years after the events of the Alien, with out ""s"" in the end and we see Elen still recovering from the shock of the film now is been task alongside a battalion of space-marines to investigate some issues with the colony, which has been made on the moon of the first film. And then the marines find out that the enemy is way out of their league and it becomes a race for them to escape.What I am fan of Aliens is that it makes it clear that humans had it coming for the arrogantly settle a unknown place and with just brute force can fix the problems there. But as they say in Greece ""You make plans and God laughs at you!"" and we see something else : the hubris of Ancient Greece ,the sin of too much arrogance and bolt actions with out thinking first. And Cameron has stated that he draw inspiration of the Vietnam War for the theme of ""The Big Bad Marines biting more than they can chew"" .Ok that is one nit pick of mine with that film, but I won't blame the directorial team ,but the eighties for film which had some kind of conflict ,usually used the recent then experiences from that war to show how bad was the situation in the flick. Alas if it is done nice I am unable to crumble about it and here it also the case.One other pros of the film is the effects, gore ,practical all that good stuff which I love from action films of the eighties, because they are real, the actors can react in and with it and so their job is made a lot easier to be what they must be in the studio. Which in this case is people in a hostile environment.Also Sigourney Weaver is awesome in her role and I consider her role as Rirley and she continued the long standing tradition of strong female characters in Cameron with the likes of Sara Conor and Neytiri. For if you think it for a moment the majority of leading female characters in action flick is only by him , Tarantino and George Miller if you include Fury Road (Which I do!).In conclusion if you haven't seen it, what were you doing in the last three decades? Go watch it and if you are a man and have a girlfriend ,then watch it with her to show her that you appreciate women for more that their looks!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A fun ride,"While I liked Aliens, James Cameron managed to do something that no other director in the history of filmmaking has ever done: he enhanced a movie series and simultaneously ruined it.While Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection aren't exactly the best films, they would have been a more natural progression in the series. The dialogue, the cinematography and the pacing was more conducive to that of the original film. As for Cameron, while his film is entertaining, he brought nothing to enhance the series artistically. Granted, I love all of Hudson's one-liners as much as the next person, it just didn't fit with the vision of the original film. All in all, this film presents a conundrum for me. I watch the film whenever its on TV or whenever I'm bored, but inside, I can't help thinking about what Cameron did to the series. Maybe I need to see a shrink or something.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"For those of you who have never seen a ""10-rated"" film, start here.","There is nothing I can say to detract from this film other then to regret that Corrie Henn (the little girl) chose never to appear in another film.
The plot is not overly complex (thank goodness!), but there are enough surprises and plot twists to keep everyone interested. The overly-arrogant military people start out thinking they can easily defeat anything, and discover differently.
Sigourney Weaver is at her absolute best, and she transforms from ""just an observer"" into a top-notch action hero right before our eyes! Great job, Sigourney!
This film is easily best of the ""Alien"" series; and if this film were made today, it would receive the highest honors. Unfortunately, in 1986, Sci-Fi films were not thought of as highly they are today.
For you young people out there: Give this film a watch; do NOT think of it as ""some old film done in the (sic)""80's"" that just looks 'old'. Instead treat yourself to an excellent film!

Not bad for a h-human.,"The first time I saw Aliens was on VHS in 1999 at just 8 years old and the movie just blew me away completely from it's memorable characters and beautiful visuals to it's awsome action scenes that still look amazing to this day. I was lucky to even be allowed to watch this movie when I was a kid the amount of violence, swearing, guns and aliens in this movie was enough to make any parent ban their child from watching it even with an adult present.I watched Aliens a countless number of times growing up and with each viewing it only got better and better. My first experience was of an action packed movie full of cool aliens but the older I got the more I started to notice all the little details that make this movie so memorable. As children we would often overlook a lot of details in the movies we love our minds only focused on what was cool and what stood out the most to us like awesome action scenes, cool characters and swear words.Over the past 21 years I have owned Alien's on almost all forms of media from VHS and DVD to the newer Blu Ray and Digital HD versions of the movie and after each viewing I still find something new I love about it.Aliens has some of the most likable characters in any Science Fiction action movie even if you haven't seen the movie before chances are you have heard a line quoted from the movie the most well known of course being Ellen Ripleys (Sigourney Weaver) epic line ""Get away from her you Bi**ch"".The movie was directed by Legendary Director (James Cameron) who would later go on to direct Terminator 2 Judgement Day one of the best movies ever made.Aliens still holds up as one of the best movie sequels ever made and as one of the best movies in the Science Fiction genre. The special effects while a little dated now still look fantastic and still manage to look better than most modern day Science Fiction movies.I highly recommend watching Aliens if by some miracle you haven't seen it before then do yourself a favour and watch it you will love every minute of it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
From horror to action,"This movie appealed to a lot more people than the original Alien for some reason.  Personally, I love the first one the most.  The second seems to attract more people because the number of aliens is quite large, not to mention the queen and her lair is introduced.  Weaver plays the story right, but the marines really seem to dumb-down the movie.  This would be a good movie to watch in the dark and turn up the stereo.

"Smart, Dark Sci-Fi Action Film with A+ Heroine","First: you do not need to watch the previous film ""Alien"" to understand this film. Frankly, ""Alien""
is a very suspenseful film, but I strongly prefer this one (""Aliens"") as it has a bad@ss heroine.Having said that, this film has nearly everything you want in a smart Sci-Fi action movie:
>> Excellent sets and context
>> Good acting all around, they stay in character (cliche at times)
>> Fantastic villains
>> Lots of tension, from the word ""go""
>> Great weapons effects
>> The best heroine characterSTORY: The story is quite good, provides excellent background and clear context. The characters
have almost zero development, but there's enough nuance and emotional energy to stay invested.Some characters are cliche: the ""off-the-wall"" marine, the tough Latino chick, etc.ACTING: Excellent acting all around, though Weaver takes the cake as the heroine. I would have
preferred less stock supporting characters, but nothing too wooden here.TEMPO: Like ""The Terminator,"" this film really doesn't let off the gas much, end-to-end.While the first half provides an excellent foundation, it's the second half the the tension and pace
pick up. It's not fast-paced per se, but you have ample tension to keep you gripped. The last 45 min
is where the fun happens ...CINEMATOGRAPHY: For a 1986 film I thought it was stellar (no pun intended). Great shots, long, short,
dark, light. Yes, the film is a ""dark"" film, so be aware it's both for context and mood.DIRECTING: Cameron has directed and / or written two of my favorite films: ""Aliens"" and ""The Terminator.""
Unfortunately, I have not liked anything else he has done. My guess is ... these two films are his earlier
work; then Hollowood comes breathing down his neck about pumping out film and making money, etc.Dunno.Overall, if you like action, but not stupid action ... if you like Sci-fi, but not the nerdy stuff ... if you
enjoy a strong (talented) female lead instead of the usual list of males {insert names here} ...
then watch this. Watch it in the dark : )",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best one,"This has to be the best film in the series, Cameron really knew how to perfectly mix the action with horror.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent blend of sci-fi and action which is better than Alien,"There is no doubt that James Cameron is a master film maker with such classic films as Terminator 1 & 2 and True Lies under his belt (which are all personal favourites of mine). He also created Aliens which is a near perfect follow up to the popular 1979 film Alien.The film begins with a salvage crew discovering a ship which Ripley (Weaver) has been drifting in for 57 years as a result of being in some sort of hyper sleep. She still has her beloved cat Jonesey from the first film who presumably must have been in a hyper sleep as well.We quickly learn that in the 57 years that Ripley has been asleep (I think only Sleeping Beauty has slept for longer than that)that there have been colonies of families that have been studying the planet where Ripley's crew discovered the Alien life forms in the first film. When contact becomes lost with the colony, a group of marines are sent in to investigate what's been going on - this is initially done as a precaution as they suspect that contact has been lost due to a faulty transmitter. Upon hearing this, Ripley isn't convinced that a faulty transmitter is to blame and she suspects that there is a possibility that the Aliens may have re-surfaced. This leads to Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) and Lt Gorman (William Hope) asking Ripley to join them as a 'consultant' as she is more knowledgeable about the Aliens and they believe that if they are out there, that she will be the best person to assist the Marines in eradicating the Aliens for good.I think there are 2 main reasons why this works better than Alien. Firstly, the pacing; Aliens gets going a lot more quickly than Alien and never dragged or became dull - this was part of the problem with Alien - the action scenes were good in Alien, but the first 45 minutes were a complete bore. Second was the action scenes - James Cameron is just so much better at creating action sequences which ultimately made Aliens a much more exciting film. One thing that was great about Alien was the direction and the way the tension was created, but James Cameron even with the faster pacing and better action sequences still managed to create arguably greater tension and even crisper direction (but what did you expect from the mastermind behind the excellent original Terminator and the masterpiece of Terminator 2 that followed).The only minor gripe that I had was the character of Hudson (portrayed by Bill Paxton). Whilst Paxton's acting was great, his character was really annoying with his constant whining and repeatedly saying 'Man' at the end of every sentence. Other than that, I will happily sing this film's praises! Whilst Aliens is undoubtedly a better film than Alien, I would recommend watching Alien before Aliens as you will have a better understanding of the themes contained in Aliens.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
They don't kill you. She's alive!!,After suffering a horribly traumatic encounter with an alien. Lone survivor of the cargo starship Nostromo Lt Ellen Ripley is picked up against extreme odds by a salvage team in deep space. Now she has been asked to return as an advisor on a hunt and destroy mission to save a colony and eradicate the species that wiped out her crew. With an elite marine squadron she embarks in the mission to face her fears and put her nightmares to an end.This is 1 of the greatest movies ever made without a doubt in my opinion. It is definitely in my top 5. James Cameron did a superb job at making this movie and also some great performances from the cast though I think Carrie Henn wasn't a very good child actress but that is no impact whatsoever in this work of movie genius. In particular Sigourney Weaver is just fantastic as Ripley and her relationship with horribly scarred and traumatised Newt (Carrie Henn) give such great depth to the story. As for the Aliens. They are just as horrific than the original and are the true stars of this film along with a new and even more terrifying character addition.

Great sequel - 7.5 for me,"Aliens is a solid sequel that builds on the foundation of the original Alien film while carving out its own identity. Right from the start, the space scenes are visually striking, showcasing impressive production design, especially inside the spaceship. The hospital scene, in particular, stands out for its meticulous attention to detail. The slow-motion scenes combined with excellent sound design create a tense atmosphere that keeps you engaged.The overall production design has a bit of a Star Wars vibe, which adds a familiar yet distinct touch to the film's aesthetic. I couldn't help but feel that some of the smaller plot points may have influenced Christopher Nolan with his film Interstellar, particularly in their approach to exploring space and human survival.In terms of writing, I found Aliens to be stronger than its predecessor, Alien. This makes sense, as Alien was more of a slow build, laying the groundwork for the story. The acting in Aliens is spot-on, with Ripley's cold, determined character driving the action forward. Within the first 30 minutes, the film picks up pace, setting the stage for what becomes a progressively intense experience.One aspect I appreciate is the minimal use of cuts during dialogue scenes. This allows for a more immersive experience and feels efficient in conveying the characters' emotions and interactions. The film's realism is another highlight, with practical effects like functional robots, believable equipment adding to the sense of immersion and the ""knife game"" scene.However, I'm not a huge fan of the VFX here; I think Ridley Scott's work in the original Alien film did it better. Despite this, the cinematography is effective, with commendable close-up shots that heighten the tension. The action scenes, while chaotic, are well-edited and shot, contributing to the film's overall intensity. Still, the writing stands out as the strongest element for me.The film is purposefully long, reflecting the characters' struggle to figure out how to complete their mission. While this length adds to the realism, it can also make the film feel drawn out at times. There are smart decisions made throughout, but also some missed opportunities that are evident upon reflection.While the film has its flaws, it also has interesting and thought-provoking moments that make it more than just a straightforward mission-rescue story. For my personal taste, Aliens earns a solid 7 out of 10, with an extra nod for the emotional connections it fosters with its characters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

James Cameron's Unmistakable Mastery Makes 'Aliens' a Consummate Fright-Fest!,"'Aliens', the sequel to Ridley Scott's eerie space thriller, is a high-tech, souped-up war movie - a rare instance where a follow-up deviates from the formula and finds an effective rhythm in propelling the story.Having overcome a terrifying alien predator, Ripley (a fantastic Sigourney Weaver in her best performance of the series) is found drifting through space in a life-pod by a salvage ship and brought back to a space station, where Burke, a representative of The Company, tells her that she has been unconscious for 57 years. To her horror, Ripley also learns that the planet on which she and her crew found the creature in 'Alien' has been colonized. It isn't long, however, until Burke tells her that they've lost contact with the colony (a series of scenes involving those colonists confronting a mysterious spacecraft shows us that Ripley's worst fears are realized: the alien life forms have reappeared) and asks her to accompany a platoon of colonial marines to the planet as an adviser. She's sent in with a crack squad of marines and hurtles headlong into a hi-tech house of horrors that delivers plenty of shocks and nail-biting suspense.Once the marines land, the film becomes a feast of fights and special effects, from the high-tech weaponry of the marines to the aliens themselves. But 'Aliens' wisely never allows its admittedly eye-catching and inventive gizmos to control the film. Rather, they provide striking punctuation! It's almost all suspense-building, as it expertly draws out the audience's mounting anxiety. For well over two hours, the audience sits transfixed in a web of despair, and around every corner there exists a bleak reality that never lets up, even in brief moments where an upper hand seems within reach. Consider this: The first full-grown alien does not appear until after the one-hour mark as the full figure of the alien eludes full photographic exposure during many of the confrontations, and that only adds to the adrenaline. We may know what it looks like based on past experience, but who is to say they have not evolved.James Cameron's sense of precision allows the movie to make distinctive departures from its predecessor. Ridley Scott was the right director to make a movie as cautious and observing as 'Alien', but it took a man with great nerve to concoct a follow-up that could amp up the adrenaline beyond simple passages of action. Masterfully controlling the tension and moving the involving plot at a lightning pace, Cameron exploits everyone's worst fears and carries them to the riveting extreme in this consummate fright-fest. Where most horror films goose the gore quotient to elicit excitement from audiences, the visceral nature of Aliens is tempered so as not to override the main thrust of the story.Thanks to him, Aliens proves to be a tightly constructed yarn that has no problem keeping its audience's attention rapt. It is visceral entertainment!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the most exciting films ever,"Aliens is an absolute blast in every way. The franchise goes from horror to action, as Ripley joins a team on a mission to find out what happened to the colony on the moon where she found the alien egg. Alien was a good movie, but I consider Aliens to be superior. Aliens has absolutely everything: it's got great acting from everyone including the child actor. It has a very entertaining script with fascinating war themes and excellent character development for all of its characters. It's brilliantly directed and is one of the tensest and most terrifying films of all time. The action is staggering, but there is some drama here as well. Ripley may have been awesome in the first film, but here she cements herself as pretty much the best female movie character of all time. It's difficult to choose the best moment of the film as every moment moves the film forward and every scene, even the dialogue ones, makes you feel like you're on a high-speed roller coaster flying off the rails. It gets exhausting occasionally, but only because the sheer intensity of the film is an utter knockout.

Definately James Cameron's greatest film ever.57 years after the events on the starship Nostromo, Ripley (played here again by Sigourney Weaver), is rescued from her deep space sleep, only to have to return to the planet from where the aliens originated with a group of commandos to investigate the disappearance of colonists.Aliens is definately superior to the original. I love to see hundreds of those slimy creatures take out the toughest marines. And the ending of the film is just brilliant, as we finally get to see where the aliens are actually coming from.This film has got it all. After watching this film, I have to wonder what the hell happened to James Cameron? He used to make the greatest films, such as Aliens, and The Terminator, and now he makes Titanic? Hopefully, Cameron will return to the action genre, and keep us all entertained with another classic science fiction/action film.The best film by James Cameron to date, is also one of the scariest films of all time. This film beats out any horror film in terms of thrills and chills, as Cameron uses the best lighting and effects to keep you on the edge of your seat.If you have not seen Aliens, you do not know what you are missing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nothing less than the perfect action film,"On a lonely, fog-shrouded planet, Ellen Ripley and a team of tough colonial marines face off against the Universe's most implacable, acid-blooded, face-sucking, chest-bursting creatures...and their mother. James Cameron's pounding militaristic sequel to Ridley Scott's 'Alien' (1978) is a non-stop action movie with just the perfect touch of humour and pathos. Sigourney Weaver is superb as the tough, resourceful and surprisingly maternalistic Ripley (who once again awakens to find herself in a nightmare) as is Michael Biehn as Hicks, the corporal reluctantly in command of the slowly diminishing squad of Marines that includes motor-mouth Pte. Hudson (the late Bill Paxton) and Latina hard-case Pte. Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein). Rounding out an excellent cast is Lance Henriksen as Bishop, an android who painfully proves himself to be as good as a human, comedian Paul Reiser as duplicitous corporate scumbag Carter Burke, and Carrie Henn as Newt, who is mostly the best little kid ever to grace a science fiction film, mostly. The uncannily realistic effects are 'practical' (i.e. Not CGI), and the sets and the production design of things such as the spaceships, the APC, and the titular creatures is outstanding. This is one of the films that no matter where I tune in, there is always a 'good bit' about to happen and I end up watching it through to the end yet again (occasionally rewatching the scene that begins with Vasquez yelling ""Let's rock!"" a couple of extra times for good measure). I loved this film when I first saw it in the theatre in 1986 and it still enthralls me 35 years later. UPDATE Sept. 2020: Finally got around to watching the extended version. Establishing that Ripley had a daughter before the events in the original 'Alien' (1979) makes her bonding with Newt more predictable (and less poignant), but the footage of Newt's family checking out the alien ship is pretty good, as are the scenes with the sentry guns. The many fans of Pte. Hudson will appreciate some extra badassery on the drop-ship. This movie is so good that I watched the entire film again only a month later just to see the extra seventeen minutes in context.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A quick comment about the Director's Cut,"I watched the ""Director's Cut"" once or twice before. As much as I love the additional scenes in all of James Cameron's ""Special Editions"", when I saw it before I thought the added scene with Newt's family diminished from the effect of meeting Newt later. This time I thought it was actually even better: Meeting Newt as a ""regular girl"" first and then seeing her transformation, actually adds a layer to her character. I really liked the way she acted and thought it was a great combination of casting, acting and direction. Not that her screamings weren't annoying at times, but all in all, I think she was excellent in her role and more believable than many other kids I saw in movies.James Horner's score is excellent.BTW, did you notice that when they discuss Bishop, they mention that the android from the first movie was made by Cyberdine?Last time I gave it a 8/10. This time I give it a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Perfect.,"Easily Cameron's best film. Aliens is an amazing film which was made for a mere $16 million which puts this years crappy CGI fests to shame.The story starts off with Ripley drifting through space 52 years after the first film. She is told that there is a colony on the planet where the first alien was found and that they had lost contact with. She is sent there with a bunch of marines and then hell breaks loose. The colony is desolate, the only survivor being a small girl, Newt(one of only two child actors who could ever act, the other being Haley Joel Osment).  Oh yes, plus there's the small fact that the Aliens have taken over it. There are some stunning action sequences involving the aliens and some brilliant characterisations. Sigourney Weaver is at a career best as Ripley, the only female hero ever to be taken seriously. There are some very funny moments and the aliens are b****y scary. All in all, a first class film, thoroughly entertaining from start to finish. Oh, and if you can hunt it down, there's a director's cut which adds more character material and an extra action sequence doing the rounds. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent sci-fi/horror entertainment,"Lt. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), who survived the horrible events in ALIEN, wakes up from her deep-freeze sleep decades later, only to find out that the planet where the rest of her crew was killed by slimy alien monsters is now colonized. When all contact to the colonists is lost, Ripley accompanies a military rescue team back to the planet that she barely escaped from almost 60 years ago, and where alien monsters are running wild again.Slam-bang action/horror/sci-fi adventure yarn by director James Cameron, who previously had co-written and directed TERMINATOR and went on to direct very successful big-scale movies such as ABYSS and TITANIC.With characters that make sense, great special effects, numerous shocks and frightening moments, ALIENS II makes for very compelling entertainment, and provides a very effective atmosphere of angst and the-monster-lurks-around-the-next-corner suspense. In fact, the film is so intriguing and gripping that even the implausible finale has viewers sitting on the edge of their seats.8 stars out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"For once, a sequel worthy of the original!","Usually, I don't enjoy sci-fi, but this and 'Alien' (1979) are the exceptions.I watched 'Aliens' in a state of apprehension. Seven years between the original and a sequel (especially a sequel starring one of the original cast members) can be a very long time. A long time for things to go wrong. And this was, perhaps, what was going through the minds of executives at Twentieth Century Fox when they green-lighted James Cameron's sequel to Ridley Scott's masterful horror film set in space.If anything, if you're going in to 'Aliens' blind or having already watched 'Alien', you're in for an interesting sequence of events.From the beginning, it's very clear that, as an audience member, you're getting a rare treat, not just in terms of horror or action -- literally in terms of any genre of cinema. You are getting a proper sequel!But, a sequel that establishes its own rules.Sigourney Weaver was feisty and held her own in 'Alien', but here she becomes a pure bad-ass! If you have the 'Alien Quadrilogy' set, you can see from the Director's Cut that her character, Ellen Ripley has a lot of issues going on. The perfect early example of a conflicted, brave and determined heroine. The theatrical release gets these things across well, too. As does the fact that Weaver was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance -- in a time when horror/action flicks were largely denied such honours. Forget Lara Croft - here's the real deal!But it's in Ripley's interaction with Carrie Henn's character, Newt and Michael Biehn's Corporal Hicks that the film develops its pathos. A chance for redemption and a life beyond being terrorised by a load of slimy space monsters.Not to give too much away, but 'Aliens' is, in an odd way, drawn from similar threads as 'Jurassic Park' (1993) and 'The Lost World' (1997). It's distinct from those films, obviously, but the gung-ho element of an overpowered military force confronting a swarm of devilishly sly and powerful creatures rings similar bells. For die-hard fans of the 'Alien' franchise (or even of films in general), they will know what I am saying when I mention that 'Aliens' also shares key links with Tim Burton's original 'Batman' (1989), from its design to its filming.There's a really great and touching story here, though, which develops James Cameron as the worthy successor (perhaps even an equal) to Ridley Scott himself in terms of developing the original ideas of Scott and his crew. Incidentally, this is the only one of James Cameron's films that I have seen and enjoyed.Lance Henriksen, Jenette Goldstein and Bill Paxton in some of their best known and pervasive film roles are all superb and a perfect match for the extremely well cast original film. Goldstein, in particular, has the ballsy attitude of Grace Jones, whilst still remaining a likable character, and Paxton steals some of the film's best dialogue. Even Jones the cat returns!For once, a sequel that is just as (if not more) enjoyable and hard- hitting as the original. If I had to raise a qualm with the film, it is that the 'Alien' series went into serious decline after this instalment. And, even though I've seen the other sequels, I prefer to accept things as they happened here as rote!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This Time It's a War!,"""Aliens"" is the second of four alien films starring Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. James Cameron takes over from Ridley Scott as the director for this installment.The story picks up where the original left off when Ripley's shuttle craft is found by a salvage ship. When she comes around she discovers that it is now 57 years later and of course no one believes her story. She also finds out from ""Company"" man Burke (Paul Reiser) that the planet upon which the first alien was discovered, is now inhabited. Then it is discovered that all communications has ceased from that planet.So Burke convinces Ripley to accompany him and a platoon of crack marines, as a consultant to go back to the planet to see what has happened. The marines are led by a green lieutenant (William Hope) and include a tough sergeant (Al Mathews), Cpl. Hicks (Michael Biehn), a tough female, Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein) and a nervous Pvt. Hudson (Bill Paxton). An android called Bishop (Lance Hendricksen) is also along.They arrive at the station on the planet and find the it is deserted...except for a frightened little girl called ""Newt"" (Carrie Henn). Ripley manages to gain the girl's confidence and becomes her protector. She also discovers that Burke has his own agenda.The marines find the alien nest while on a reconnaissance mission. The aliens attack and several marines are killed. The survivors retreat back into the station and prepare for the ultimate invasion.James Cameron wisely decided not to duplicate the first film which was essentially a claustrophobic horror film. This film has more gadgets, more action and more bodies. The special effects are quite convincing and the battles with the monsters are very exciting.The character of Ripley if you can believe it goes from a frightened civilian to a female Arnold Schwarzeneggar virtually overnight and acquires an instant expertise in the weaponry as well. While that's a little hard to believe, the action sequences are quite well done especially the final battles.Not quite up to the level of the first film but an exciting action film nonetheless.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Forgive me god for I have not liked this classic one bit.,"Here I am, almost 40 years late to give an opinion about this film, but I really need to get this out of my chest.Ok, so by now I've seen all of the Alien or Alien related movies, I was only missing this one,which happened to be the one I was the most excited to watch, because of the high rating and because I had watched several videos and reviews saying the second installment was the best one. But I really don't get what the fuzz has been about.So, visual effects aside (because I know back then all of it was quite groundbreaking) I really don't understand why 1. This is considered a ""horror"" movie and 2. Why some people say this and the first one are the best movies in the franchise. I do understand that for many people the original installment of any franchise will always be the best and there will never be anything that can either top it off, or compare to it or come remotely close to how good it was. I personally don't feel that way at all about any franchise started in the 70's or 80's, and having watched all of the films in this one, I definitely feel that both the original and the second one are nowehere near prometheus, which is my personal favorite of the franchise.This film was hard for me to finish, I think the first half is very interesting and it knows how to build up to the action, but once the actual action starts happening, I felt like watching ""Indiana Jones and the spaceship with a monster inside"", bc that's what the music reminded me of, and it made sure to keep me as far as possible from seeing it as a horror film. The dialague is soooo bad, very bad, even for James Cameron standards (who is an amazing filmmaker but just an awful writer and don't get me wrong bc I'm obsessed with titanic). And the characters were so extremely stereotypical, a level of stereotypical that only an entitled white man like him can come up with.But what definitely angered me the most, was the child actor. OMG. Who casted her? Why was she casted? Didn't anyone in the pre production process notice that she just COULDN'T ACT even if her life depended on it? And if they happened to notice that she couldn't, what was the need for the character to be that age? Why couldn't it have been a teenager? Someone with a bit broader acting skills, who could make things a BIT more believable? Every scene that girl was in, just felt like pure torture, it was hard to watch, hard to listen to her READ her lines (bc that's how she sounded, like reading a teleprompter) and hard to listen to her screaming ""in fear"", her voice was just annoying.. And unfortunately she is not just on a couple scenes, because after the first 40 mins, the film basically revolves around her.I think this film is one of many examples of how children can completely ruin anything they get involved in, bc I can only think of maybe 3 or 4 children with major roles in horror movies whose performances I genuinely believed, the rest, awful actors who have gotten my mind out of the story. But this girl, man, she really takes the price as the worst child performance I've ever seen in a film, because even though the bad dialogue and the music kept me from perceving this as the masterpiece everyone says it is, it was HER ACTING what ultimately made pause the film 30 mins before its ending, and decide to finish it the next day, she is impossible to watch.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

One of the best films ever made.,"'Aliens' is a rare occasion where the sequel surpasses it's predecessor - especially since the original itself was so darn good! How is it possible for a film made over three decades ago to be this good? 'Aliens' is head and shoulders above other films of the same time.The film pretty much spends the first half setting up the characters, their mission and their predicament. It is exciting and atmospheric. I loved the character introductions, which contained some funny humor, as well. (As a bonus, there was eye candy galore...I mean, all those muscles...!). Sigourney Weaver is excellent (again) as the film's protagonist, Ripley. Paul Reiser on the other hand, is very good as the antagonist. And I also enjoyed Lance Henriksen as the android Bishop.The second half of the film is full-blown action, horror and mayhem. It's insane! The visuals are astonishing, and the production design is magnificent. How did they do all this in a time before CGI? (In fact, 'Aliens' was made almost two decades before CGI became indispensable in movies.) This time around the film is even more suspenseful, since we're now all too familiar with the evil that lurks in the dark. The last act is a non-stop thrill ride with incredible action scenes. 'Aliens' is undoubtedly one of the best 80's films, if not the best.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The definition of space action-horror,"This is a reference for so many other movies, and still my all-time favourite next to the first one.James Cameron re-invents space sci-fi right here, apparently he didn't go for expensive state of the art (at the time) special effects for this movie either. He accomplishes the thrill by very fast moving scenes when the aliens are present; obviously the suspense and thrill from the creature(s) is set-up by Ridley Scott and the design of H.R. Giger. But what Cameron does with it is awesome and inspired the future of space action-horror for many other artists, developers and cineasts.The only thing I would advise for watching this movie is watching the first one before this, the tension will be so much higher if you have a background on the most important cast member(s).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

So-so,"Good special effects, Sigourney Weawer is a good actress, James Cameron of Titanic and Avatar, is a very strong reference, but far away from Ridley Scott in the genre. But the movie ...
The original Alien of 1979, is one of the best sci-fi of all time in creativity and quality, and in my view, the best in the sci-fi horror genre. This one here copies everything and does not add anything new. Army troops are overly standardized and unrealistic. The characters seem to be drawn from classic post WWII movies with no knowledges to be involved in a high tech environment . Although we have some good characters like our synthetic man Bishop, but Burke is weak in all respect and without much logic.

Now that we'd seen what the Alien was about in Ridley Scott's Alien (1979), James Cameron had to take the sequel in a new direction and he did just that. I like how he stayed true to the first film but took a totally different approach. Instead of a slow, suspense horror masterpiece. Aliens is more of an adrenaline fuelled action packed thrill ride, but it still gives the amazing horror atmosphere of an alien film.The Plot Again is fairly simple but it does what it needs to and does it well. The characters are even better than the first film imo. Ripley's character is built on much further, her performance is just mind blowing in this film and Hudson is just legendary. The cast, characters and writing is perfect and there are just so many memorable lines.The scenes and practical effects in this film are again just beautiful. The Aliens look more realistic than any film to date. The music is again spot on and it makes for such an intense atmosphere.I go back and forth on whether this or Alien is the better film.

"What're We Supposed To Use Now, Harsh Language?","I felt so soiled after watching the mindless train wreck called `Alien: Resurrection' that I was compelled to watch `Aliens' immediately afterward, in order to cleanse my palette and to remind myself why Hollywood keeps the `Alien' franchise on life support.  Man, if only some new director could recapture the essence of `Aliens', or if only James Cameron could be convinced to direct the next film in the franchise.  `Aliens' is that good.`Aliens', for the uninitiated, picks up sixty some-odd years after the end of the original `Alien'.  Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), the lone survivor of the doomed spaceship Nostromo, is found by a passing galactic freighter and revived from suspended animation.  Ripley learns that the lethal lessons learned by her ship's crew went unnoticed by the rest of the universe  the planet where her crew found the original deadly Alien creature has been partially terraformed and colonized by human settlers.  But, surprise surprise, the colony's been wiped out, and now a hard-bitten group of Space Marines are going to the planet to find out what happened.  Ripley is conscripted as an advisor and goes back to the planet with the Marines, where they discover that the colony hasn't been wiped out by a single Alien. . . but by an Alien brood mother and her legions of hungry, vicious, offspring.In making `Aliens', James Cameron created a great sequel to a great original film, one that manages to remain true to the original while offering a fresh take on old ideas.  Cameron took the original look and feel of the Alien creatures, remained faithful with the character of Ripley . . . and then moved forward with a brand new story.  `Aliens' isn't simply a rehash of Ridley Scott's `Alien'.  While they possess certain common denominators, they're two distinctly different films.  `Aliens' is wall-to-wall pulse-pounding action, while `Alien' is more straightforward horror. Cameron deliberately didn't try to copy Ridley Scott, which is why this film works so well . . . and why the later sequels don't.  Those later films have nothing new to say.The fights between the Marines and the Aliens are gripping as well, masterfully directed and choreographed by Cameron.  The Marines, while mostly personality stereotypes, are fairly memorable as well  it's quite a shock to see their bravado before they encounter the Aliens, and the shreds of what's left afterwards.  A great ensemble cast  Michael Biehn is very good as the vulnerable Sergeant Hicks, as is Lance Henrikson as the android Bishop (in a nice nod to the `Terminator' films, it's implied that androids were originally created by the Cyberdyne Corporation), and Paul Reiser is outstanding as Carter Burke, an oily government executive.  Besides Sigourney Weaver, though, the best performance comes from Carrie Henn as Newt, the little girl who also happens to be the only survivor of the original colony massacre.  Her character's vital to the film  Ripley wants to protect Newt at all costs, much as the Alien Brood mother wants to protect her lethal progeny.  If Newt was unlikable, or if she was just a two-dimensional cardboard cutout, a lot of Ripley's motivations  and the plot  would fall flat on its face.  Fortunately, she's terrific.  And so is `Aliens'.There are a few plot holes that keep `Aliens' from being a classic, but the film moves along at such a rapid pace, you really don't have much time to notice them.  Still, `Aliens' is one of James Cameron's best films.  It's a pure adrenaline rush from start to finish.  If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend renting it sometime soon.

Has you hooked,"I do not like horrors. But watching Aliens was great. First up, Aliens really is not a horror. Its predecessor, Alien is clearly a horror film and its two successors, Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection are too. Even though the original films prequel, Prometheus is not very scary, it is still meant as a horror and so is its upcoming sequel, Alien:Covenant.Aliens is terrific. It uses silence and normal sounds terrifyingly. Even when nothing is yet happening, the feel of terror is so big that the moment the aliens attack, is not even half as scary. The film itself is great and I love it. Sigourney Weaver is a great actor and James Cameron, the films writer and director, is definitely a genius.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Even better than the first one!,"I liked Alien so much! It is one of my all time favorite movies ever to exist! And this is even better.So Alien was a mix between horror and sci-fi, while Aliens turns the horror more into a thriller and adds the action/adventure elements to it.It greets you with an amazing cast of characters you really care for, and nothing can stop that, even if you watched the movie before.Rebecca, or Newt, is the most caring kid character in a monster movie. Usually kids in a monster movie don't work out, but here it does.Why I like Aliens more than it's source material Alien, because you saw how a single xenomorph was powerful, and now seeing an entire race of them and they're awesome queen is just amazing.If you want to see this more than Alien, you don't need to see Alien, even though Aliens is the sequel. That is why I like it.10/10. Another masterpiece that is better than the original... Classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Is Sigourney more scary than the queen ?,"Much more brash than the original this is the film where Ripley really gets balls. The extended edition gives a little 	  more background, but it's really the action sequences where this one scores. Sigourney Weaver really comes into her own and 	  Ripley is as fearsome as the Queen. Perhaps you best not think too much about the plot though. With lots of nasty creatures 	  itching to kill everybody and the base due to be blown into outer space withing 4 hours Ripley ... goes to sleep. It must be adeep sleep as well since even a large glass container smashing doesn't wake her up. Anyway who cares about plot when the action is 	  this good. What a pity they didn't end the series here.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Before there was Judgment Day, there was Aliens","The original Alien film of 1979 was an amazing horror film that had atmosphere, suspense and scares. Certainly, a sequel couldn't replicate what the original did. Right? Wrong! Talks of a sequel occured after the release of Alien and there was even an unofficial, by name only sequel called Alien 2: On Earth that was released in 1980. But it wouldn't be until 1986 when we would get the sequel to Alien titled Aliens. (The S really matters here). James Cameron (who just got done doing The Terminator) directed this film and also wrote the script as well for this film. The film itself was a critical success as well as a box office success is often considered superior to the original (though that is debateable). The film even managed several award nominations including a Best Actress in a Leading Role nomination at the Academy Awards. The film sees the return of Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley and huge cast of people (most of whom have worked with Cameron or would go onto work with Cameron in other films). The cast includes Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, and Lance Henriksen just to name a few.We see Ripley in cryo sleep (pretty much where we last saw her). Some people rescue her and she learns that she has been in cryo sleep for 57 years. She tells her story about what happened but nobody believes her. She then learns that the planet that the crew landed on in the first film is now home to a colony of people who terra formed the planet. When they notice something wrong at the colony, they send Ripley down to the planet with a group of Marines who may or may not be a match for what is to come.First of all, Aliens is a fantastic movie. I am not going to say that this film is better than the original because this films is different when compared to the original film. First of all, this film is more action heavy whereas the original film is more horror heavy. They are two different types of films. But with that being said, Aliens still retains the suspense that was present in the original film. The action is done fairly well here and is (at least in my book) one of the best pre-Die Hard action films. It is two and a half hours of marines blowing the crap out of the Aliens and it is oh so violent. AND I LOVE IT!!! This film is bigger than the previous and does so because there are more than one Alien this time around. We saw what one Alien could do, now lets see what hundreds could do (plus a little surprise at the end). The characters here are amazing as well. Ellen Ripley already established herself as the survivor of the Nostromo incident, now she comes back because she knows that the Aliens must be wiped out. James Cameron explained it fairly well in an interiew that it is like people who fought in Vietnam, they want to go back. If you thought Ripley wasn't badass enough in the original, you will find that in this film, she is a million times more of a badass than she was previously. There is a larger cast of characters in this film and most of them get killed off fairly early but the ones that stay longer, you start to grow attached to. Characters like Bill Paxton's Hudson is a clown, but fairly likeable and funny. Jenette Goldstein's Vazquez is really badass here as well. They are all fairly likeable (some more than others), but we want them to get through this. As said previously, this film is violent. The practical effects are done very well and there are two instances where CG/Green screen is used (and I have seen better). The Alien designs (Cameron said the designs were simpler) were great and funny enough is that only six costumes were made and they used the same six costumes for the whole movie! Impressive. I would mention another marvel but that would have me possibly ruin the film for those who have not watched it (and I prefer writing spoiler free reviews). One thing that seems to get lots of praise about is that this film can be watched without having to watch the original and that is one hundred percent true! This was my first Alien movie and I seem to understand everything. The film does a good job explaining the events of the original that you do not have to even watch the original to understand anything about the Aliens or even Ripley. The film has a good ending and it seems that the series should have ended there, right? Wrong. A sequel was made a few years later but Alien 3 will be for another day.Aliens is a film that is on par with the original and honestly I still cannot decide whether or not this film is better than the original. It is action packed, suspenseful, scary, and just a fun film to watch overall. A fantastic film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Aliens is not Sci Fi but it is meh,"Alien was an entertaining movie that did extremely well at the box office but it palls in comparison to Alien .

I've watched Alien countless times but there are some scenes that still send chills down my spine . Can't say the same for Aliens . While it was somewhat entertaining when first released , it does not hold up well . In fact , it's creaky to watch now . The special effects are cringeworthy. The aliens are not scary.

Stunning and epic,"Stunning and epic thriller set in space. Everything is great about ""ALIENS"" the plot the storyline fine continuity and not only it follows where Riddley Scott left off but adds something unique to the gender. And the way the story unfolds gradually building up the tension while at the same time treading on that fine line between dark and light, good and evil, is just amazing how that was done in terms of sentimentality Ripley ,missed her daughter's birthday because fate was cruel to her given the circumstances of her floating out into space for 57 years, after she escaped from the Nostramo, and now she sees in Newt the one and only child who could possibly make up for the hole left in her soul once she found out her daughter was gone only 2 years prior to her rescue and here is her chance to make up for it. The way this chemistry between Newt and Ripley develops can clearly be seen throughout the movie little at first but as the movie advances, their relationship grows ever stronger and culminates at the end when Newt calls Ripley ""mommy"". It's clear that James Cameron and all his crew had their hearts set on making a movie not just for the money but also for providing high quality action to the viewer blended with that feeling that despite all the evil around us, despite all the risks we take all the compromises we might make, love conquers all in the end from start to finish while at the same time making us relate in some way to anyone of the characters..I mean you gotta understand that love, sentimentality and aliens, the story of the movie don't quite mix generally speaking, but by bringing Newt into the picture as the orphan child, the way the chemistry between the main character and the little kid develops, is just amazing..is something unique and you don't get to see this a lot in movies of this gender at least not a lot.

One Of The Biggest And Best Sequels Ever,"It's certainly hard to talk about sci-fi movies and not bring up Aliens. James Cameron's sequel to the 1979 horror classic Alien is not only superior to its predecessor but it's among the greatest sci-fi movies to have ever been released.Aliens picks up where Alien left off, only it's been over forty years, and Ripley's been in cryo-sleep the whole time. After a not-so-friendly meeting about what happened in Alien, Ripley is revoked of her license. Then she finds out that the inhabitants of a colony that landed on LV-426; the alien planet have gone missing. Ripley, by her own will, chooses to go with a group of marines to hunt down the disturbance. As you might expect, things get pretty sticky and tight in Aliens as there's more than one, a lot more.James Cameron puts an action emphasis on Aliens unlike Ridley Scott's horror direction for Alien. And it's this that Aliens does so well, being a great action movie along with some thrilling moments. Not only does this change in direction make Aliens a more exciting film but also a better film. It's not just that the action in Aliens itself is great, but also that Cameron went for an original approach for the action attitude rather than make another horror-focused movie.There's also some great actors to find in Aliens. Sigourney Weaver of course returns as Ripley and she's much more serious than her character in Alien, so yeah, she's pretty bad-a** now. You've also got Micheal Beihn-who played Kyle from the Terminator as Corperal Hicks, and Beihn once again does a great acting job. Then there's everyone's favorite marine from Aliens, Bill Paxton as Hudson. You of course have to love Paxton for giving Hudson some of the best one-liners like ""Oh that's great, that's just f**,king great, now what the f**k are we supposed to do? We're in some real tight s**t now man!"" Once again, I have to talk about the action itself in Aliens, as it's so impressive and fun to talk about. I could mention so many awesome scenes from Aliens but the one that I love the most are the sequences with the Alien Queen. I must also give kudos to Cameron for the scenes of the Alien Queen against Ripley in the loader, which just flat-out rocks! The magnitude of Aliens was and still is excellent and huge.If you ever find yourself in need of a perfect Saturday-night sci-fi movie, Aliens will work ever time. It's just one of those movies that you don't get tired of watching, ever. Thank you James Cameron, for making some of the greatest movies of the 80's and 90's, Aliens was a true accomplishment!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not as good as I used to think,"Definitely not as good as the original Alien, but still way better than all other sequels and thus the second-best in the series. This used to be my favorite and I have seen it probably 20 plus times, but not in a while. This time, however, I am starting to see flaws that I never noticed before. My eyes have gotten more acute over the years.The writing is not as great as the original. There is too much bad exposition. For example, Cameron will start a scene with ""so you are telling me after 3 hours of being here you want me to tell the story again."" This is typical bad Hollywood exposition (There are a lot worse, but this is also not very good). They can't show the 3 hours of Q&A so they wrap it up in a one-liner that she was there for 3 hours. But people don't talk like that, and there are many other ways to accomplish the same without being so obvious about providing data/info to the audience.There are many other examples of subpar writing. Like the way the marines spoke. No serious marine soldier would take a trip to another planet to confront potentially deadly alien monsters with such levity. Nor would they interrupt senior officials in the middle of an orientation. They were more cartoon soldiers than actual soldiers. Juxtapose them with the agents/soldiers in Sicario where they totally looked and behaved like real soldiers. Here, the cast looked and talked like actors playing soldiers.The ADR (voice dubs) didn't help either, which wasn't there or noticeable in the original Alien.Nor did it make any sense for 20 or so soldiers to go down a confront what could potentially be a massive Alien race that according to Ripley killed her entire crew in less than 24 hours and there could potentially be lots of them. This would be akin to the US sending in one helicopter of marines to Iraq to combat potentially 1000s of Iraqi rebels.They know once they arrive on the planet that something is wrong by the sheer fact of the structures etc being totally destroyed and clearly not by humans, yet they continue in small groups of 3-5. Even when they find out Ripley was telling the truth they still continue claiming the ""area is secured"" in a HUGE structure they never bothered to check and notwithstanding SEEING all the signs of Aliens. The original Alien was great because they were put into situations they had no real say in and then forced to deal with it. Here, THEY drove all the decisions, despite being illogical.And how did Ripley not know what the Alien caverns were when she had seen them during the first Alien? Made no sense.And of course, they are led by a first-time captain who has never seen combat before. Because why not? And once they encountered and got attacked by the aliens they had ZERO plan, like ZERO. This is more bad writing where you FORCE characters into situations for the sake of action, rather than the other way around.I have been a huge fan of Cameron for a long time, but he definitely has a flamboyant way of writing and directing. An over-the-top in-your-face look-at-me style. Sure, it's entertaining, but it lacks the realism that Ridley Scott brought in the first one.Also, the visuals in the first one are superior to this one too.And don't bother with the overly long director's cut. It is filled with scenes totally unnecessary. Just watch the original theatrical cut.Is it still great? Yes, but with the caveat, I have mentioned. I.e. Ignore the subpar writing, acting, and directing. What's good are the fun parts.I just HATE the fact that I now see all the flaws, which make me think of a once GREAT film to a now not so great.I used to rate it 10.

Better Than The First! To Me.,"Seven years after the groundbreaking movie, Alien, James Cameron picks up the sequel which many people find better than the first. Sure there are some people that disagree, but the ones the think this is the best are entitled to think so. 1979's Alien was a sci-fi/horror, whereas this is a sic-fi/action.About 60 years after the deadly encounter with the alien that wiped out her crew, Ellen Ripley is found on a spaceship and brought home. No such aliens have been found and foreign planets have been starting to colonize. She joins a team of tough space marines to destroy any aliens they find and save any human residents. The mission proves deadly as they face many aliens and the Mother Alien. Ripley must not only face her fears again, but also protect a little girl who's family was destroyed by the aliens and who has been like a daughter to her.The element of horror incorporated in the first was great and original, but everything that the first movie had was done better. The action is better, special effects are better, sets are better, cinematography is better, excitement is stronger, the pace is faster.

So much better than the first one!,"After watching ""Alien"" I was thinking to give up on this franchise. Sequels, even good ones, usually cannot match originals, but this one is so much better than the first one that it is beyond any comparison.

A contender for the greatest film ever made.,"Yes it really is. This amazing film can hold it's head up high in the most rarefied of company - ones where literally everything comes together in perfect harmony, I'm talking Star Wars, Raiders of the lost Arc, Cameron's own T2, Die Hard, The Matrix etc where everything from the cinematography to to the score is just so bang on the money. It's no coincidence that films of this ilk just don't date like their contemporaries have done. You can just see Camerons vision all over this film.From the way this movie opens to the same creepy atmosphere of the original then proceeds to weave that into it's own narrative is nothing short of outstanding. The tension that builds in this is almost beyond belief, even after all these years, Aliens remains an EXPERIENCE like few films before or since. This film leaves you breathless, with an excellent (but slightly recycled from the wrath of khan) score by James Horner to boot.The visuals, whilst showing their age in parts, are still really, really good - you can see the continuation of this in 'Avatar' with the big load lifters etc. It still looks great - grimy and bleak - just like his terminator films.It's also full of memorable characters who nearly all get good development, humor, horror, action, and is one of the most quotable films of all time.

"Different From The Original, But Just As Good In Its Own Ways","""Game over, man! Game over!""I think that Aliens is a great sequel. It adds more action, sure, but it certainly keeps the horror elements. I do, however, think this movie sometimes falls into the same clichés that the first film suffers from.The movie starts off really strong. The way they continue from where we left off in Alien really works. We also get a bigger sense of the universe that these films exist in that we didn't quite get in the first. It also really builds up exactly what were going to be in for. However, there are times during the movie where it kind of feels like a cheesy action movie, which certainly hurts the film. As I mentioned before, it also follows a few of the same clichés that the first movie does. An example of that would be the whole ""we blew up the monster and we're safe!"" kind of cliché. It can sometimes feel like what Alien would have been if it had instead been more of an action film than an atmospheric horror film.Sigourney Weaver once again is great in this. She gives it her best once again which is great to see. When it comes to the other performances, they can be mixed. Michael Biehn gives a sometimes good, sometimes cheesy kind of performance. And Bill Paxton gives a love it or hate it performance. I think he is fun, but I can see why he could be hated. A lot of these Marines are nothing more than cheesy action movie clichés, such as the character Vasquez, who if this film was made today would be played by Michelle Rodriguez.Overall, I think this film really works as a sequel, but still suffers from some of the issues that the first movie suffers from, which brings it down. If you've seen Alien, i'd recommend watching this too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Effective combination of SCI-FI and action,"Director James Cameron's follow-up to Ridley Scott's 1979 sci-fi classic ALIEN wisely avoids the potentially fatal error of attempting to recreate the original film's style and structure, and successfully strives for something completely different. Instead of a brooding, space-age horror movie like the first film, ALIENS actually plays like a war movie in space. The emphasis is more on action than terror, and this new direction works surprisingly well even if Cameron's clunky dialogue often thuds. While it may lack the much of the haunting aura and ""art house"" inventiveness of the first film, ALIENS delivers on all accounts when it comes to breathtaking action and suspense.In an Oscar-nominated performance, Sigourney Weaver is absolutely sensational as the returning Lt. Ripley. Although some may complain that Weaver's RAMBO-esquire physical feats are nothing more than the continued macho-ization of women (and they would have a valid point), I defy anyone who questions the credibility of this actress' commanding performance. I typically loath it when films of this genre attempt to incorporate ""cute"" kids into the action, and nine-year-old Carrie Henn is a bit too sticky sweet for my taste, although her presence in the film does eventually provide a satisfying emotional playoff. The remainder of the cast includes a likeably varied group of put-on heroes, with Michael Biehn, Lance Henriksen, Bill Paxton, and Jenette Goldstein all turning in memorable portrayals.In 1991, Cameron released his ""Director's Cut"" of the film, which over 17 minutes of previously cut footage. Most of the film's fans consider this extended cut to be the definitive version of the film, yet I personally have some reservations about some of the re-added scenes. While the many moments of character development (like Ripley adjusting to the fact that so much time has passed since her previous adventure, and a surprisingly moving moment when Hicks and Ripley exchange first names) are terrific (and probably should have never been cut), but the scene where Newt's family discovers the aliens was better left to the imagination. I personally feel that the original theatrical cut should be watched first, but, either way, ALIENS remains one the finest sci-fi actioners.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A mess and the CGI doesn't work.,"Compared to the first Alien, this movie is just a mess. Too many characters and the pacing feels off. I didn't like the CGI - felt like it tried too hard without the technology being available at the time to do it justice; it all just felt and looked fake.
The first Alien was classy, measured and the acting was a cut above this one.

An Honest Review,"I have a simple policy: if the movie entertains like it's supposed to, I give it 10 stars......That being said:I'm going to give you two words: ""Space Marines"" That's right, ""space marines"" I can almost see the pitch for this. We are going to take the Alien movie, the classic horror movie in space...and we are going to turn it into an action movie in space and completely change the direction of the franchise to the point where people are going to be hesitant to go back to the horror in space formula that worked for alien.And that is kind of what happened. The Alien franchise kind of lost its horror movie cred with Aliens to the point where Alien 3 got a lot of hate for trying to bring back the successful merger of horror and science fiction.Aliens turned the franchise into a typical science fiction series...and that kind of hurts.HOWEVERYou still have Ripley and Ripley is still a super cool hero. And Aliens doubles down on her character and brings her from the tough survivor to a tough as nails warrior.And then you have a great addition of characters that quickly become beloved.And even if it changed from a horror movie to a basic science fiction movie with space marines, it was still a stellar science fiction movie. It was still stylistic and fun.So part of me hates Aliens for making that turn from horror to straight science fiction. But the other part of me recognizes it as a a very good movie for what it is with a great cast.So I'm going to give it 10 out of 10 despite wanting it to be the same kind of film that Alien was. And, at the same time, I want to praise the risk it took for taking the franchise in a new direction.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Best Film in the Franchise!,"When Alien was released in 1979, it was a monumental success. The horror film garnered high praise as its often, rightfully so, regarded as one of the best horror films of all time. 20th Century Fox took a long time to even think about producing a sequel because they felt the first film did not rake in the cash despite the accolades. We should all be saying a prayer of thanks they finally came to their senses because 1986's Aliens is bigger, better, and more intense. While Alien was a slow-moving film that builds up horror, it is successor is a brutal action/horror hybrid with a soul-sucking last hour due to its intensity. The film focuses more on the terror rather than the horror and it absolutely works. Aliens is one of those rare sequels that is better than the original, and it also happens to be one of my favorite all-time films. One that received the extremely rare perfect score from me.The film took a long time to get into production. The studio executives honestly could care less for any sequel. Under new management, interest was finally revived. Producer David Giler one day was sent the script of James Cameron's The Terminator. Cameron's debut feature hasn't filmed yet, but the producers were on board with him directing the sequel as long as The Terminator was a success. Indeed, it was a success and Cameron and producing partner Gale Anne Hurd were given the greenlight to direct the film. Cameron absolutely did everything right. He wasn't given much of a timeframe to direct the movie which caused problems in the editing room and for James Horner's scoring, but he managed to make it work.Cameron is considered to be at the forefront when the best action directors are discussed. If you were impressed with what he did in The Terminator, he takes it to an entire newer level in Aliens. Instead of one alien, there were hundreds of them and that big, bad Alien Queen, which Cameron designed himself. The final hour of the movie is bursting with such intensity, as we see aliens racing through the overhead ducts or one even operating an elevator. These aliens are the epitome of evil and they were certainly a handful for our humans with heavy firepower. Cameron compared the film to the Vietnam War- a vastly superior army sent to a foreign land where their tactics had little to no success. I found that to be an interesting analogy. It certainly worked well visually.Signourey Weaver almost did not return to the sequel after a contract dispute with the studio, but Cameron refused to write her out of his script, so the studio had to pay her. Weaver returns as Ellen Ripley, the only person who survived the attacks on the Nostromo. She awakens 57 years later to find out everyone she knows had died. She is not given a warm welcome because no one believed that the alien attack happened. She also learned the moon where they initially made contact with the alien species is now a colony formed by The Company. A squadron of Marines are sent over to discover why the colony stopped making contact. Ripley's concerns are now valid. Aliens most certainly do exist, and they are hungry!Signourey Weaver is the glue that holds the team together. She kicks plenty of butt and I love her motherly instinct for the girl, Newt (Carrie Henn) who survived such unspeakable terror. Weaver actually earned an Academy Award nomination which was surprising considering the Academy does not recognize genre filmmaking. Well-deserved nomination! I really loved this team and their different personalities; Jeannette Goldstein as the extremely brave Private Vasquez, Bill Paxton as the narcissistic, but cowardly Private Hudson, Michael Biehn as the mild-mannered and exemplary leader Corporal Hicks, Paul Reiser as the slimy Burke, and Lance Henriksen as the friendly droid Bishop. The chemistry from the team is utterly fantastic. Great one-liners, great teamwork, and ready to kick some alien butt!When it comes to visuals and sound effects, Cameron makes sure he uses the best technology available and even invents stuff if need be. The production design and the lighting will blow your mind. I loved the designs of the aliens and especially the queen. In today's world of films, it is incredible that I am being wowed by special effects from a film that is 34 years old. Crazy! Horner's score is appropriately tense and suspenseful. Horner and Cameron butted heads throughout the scoring process due to time constraints, but Horner managed to put together a great score after only four days of work.I love Aliens. I really do. Many action/sci-fi/horror hybrids are not able to reach the levels of James Cameron's masterpiece. If people thought The Terminator was a fluke, he proved everyone wrong here. He is the master of action; whether it is those aliens killing everyone despite heavy firepower or having Newt in the center of everything causing intensity overloads, he really knows his way around a film. If Alien was the slow-paced horror film, Aliens is the nonstop action, guns-out, aliens-heavy superior sequel. The best film in the franchise!My Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Revving up the action without sacrificing the story,"Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" was an eerie science-fiction masterpiece that perfectly captured a haunting feeling of space and redefined ""intelligent life."" Then comes time for a sequel and James Cameron, 80s action extraordinare, takes the reigns. Conflicting visions? You'd think, but somehow Cameron is able to increase the explosions without frying what made its predecessor so successful.Part of that success is the strength of Sigourney Weaver as the courageous Ellen Ripley, the best sci-fi heroine in cinematic history. This time, Ripley is awoken from hypersleep over 50 years after her first encounter with the Alien to find that the planet it was discovered on has been colonized by humans and those humans have suddenly lost contact. Ripley is asked to aide a team of space marines to check on the colonists and what they find are, well, Aliens. Lots of them.Cameron makes sure that the sequel continues Ripley's story, portraying her yet again as being doubted by others and having to correct the life-threatening mistakes they make. She continues to captivate viewers because she reacts naturally to scary situations but then chooses to act courageously.Then, Cameron adds plenty extra guns, flame-throwers, grenades, Alien goo and more. It's almost overkill how much stuff explodes in this film and yet it never loses credibility with its audience because of the believability of the characters' struggle for survival.The plot, while a very honest follow-up to ""Alien,"" is structured in a very deja-vu manner to that film, most obviously the idea of making you think it's over when it's not over. There are also similarities in character betrayal as Ripley is apparently the only one that thinks straight up killing the Aliens is a good idea.""Aliens"" is much more exciting and fast-paced than the original, though the original still one-ups it with its strong, resonant themes about space and life. This film continues those themes but doesn't add to them like a brilliant sequel does. It instead chooses to honor the strength of the original while pumping up the special effects, which are truly grandiose and stunning.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Violence is needed for survival,"Throughout ALIENS, never once are you left wondering if the action is over. The suspense the movie evokes into one is uncommon from an 80's film. There are a plethora of reasons as to why James Cameron's film was such a hit, and many times have they been pointed out. The acting by Weaver and Paxton were phenomenal, and yes the suspense the Xenomorph can induce is petrifying, but one thing that does not get mentioned often is the tale that the story really tells.ALIENS is an action movie, and within that, it tells a story of survival. Many say that the film is a story of an invasion gone wrong, but they would be the ones in the wrong. ALIENS is a film where one crew of space marines and Ellen Ripley are sent to defend the human race. The movie is not portrayed that way, but underneath it all, had Ripley not done what she did, the fate of humans could have been forever changed. ALIENS is not a glorification of war, it is instead the opposite. It demonstrates the horrors of war, but also provides evidence as to why violence is necessary at times.Through all the blood and acid, the takeaway from ALIENS is not a story of aggression gone wrong, but a final stand in which the human race was victorious. The story line of ALIENS is due to the direct actions of ALIEN, but that is for another review. ALIENS was not intended to be a film that approved of unnecessary force, it was a film that showed how the human race survived through self defense.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good film!,"I rate Aliens a perfect 10. This second installment in the Alien series evolves the original movie's horror/sci-fi genre into action-adventure/sci-fi, setting a standard which has not yet been matched. I like this movie because it paints a picture of the future which is realistic enough to suck you in during the beginning of the film and then quickly introduces you to interesting characters who you become concerned with; some you love and others you hate.....but none of them bore you. By the time the action starts it's possible to forget you're watching a movie (at least the first couple of times). The plot is filled with tension that is occasionally broken by some of the most memorable one-liners in history (especially by Private Hudson). The special effects are remarkable, considering the fact that they were accomplished the ""old fashioned way"" prior to digital manipulation. I can report that I now own the Director's Cut and rate this version a 10 also. The extra footage will be extremely interesting to fans of the 1986 release.

ALIENS (1986) MOVIE REVIEW,"It is the second Alien film in the Alien franchise. ALIENS has a unique spunk, a distinct blend of action, horror, and character development, from the set design to the iconic lines and scenes that have hit cinema history for the ages. From the events of the prior Alien Film 1979 Ellen Ripley (Played By Sigourney Weaver) alongside Jonsey the cat from escaping their encounter with the Alien Xenomorph, 57 years have passed in the universe in which Weyland Yutani ever so corrupt they've sent a colony of terraformers to LV246 the same planet where the Nostromo crew found the eggs in the derelict ship where its time for Ripley alongside a group of Marines to find and exterminate the Xenomorphs.Made by James Cameron, the film has a lot of small prototype elements that would later be fully realized in the future film Avatar 2009, from the design of the walkers to the Marines and the meaning of family. Knowing this is a James Cameron film, this being his fourth film under his filmography, and it shows with the way the camera pans as well as understands that it's less of a horror film but has the equal visual language of its predecessor. That being ominous slow shots of the reveal of the colony on LV426, aka Hadley Hope, where the film re-reveals the facehuggers in some test tubes, the film changes visual pace when the action scenes happen where the film cinematography begins to quicken with its fast pace camera movements where our main cast of characters are also in action with its quick movements. From the fantastic camera work of the close-up shots of the character's faces in terror and badassery to its excellent iconography with Newt doll's head floating in the water. The color of the film changes from a pleasant white color to becoming more and more blue and ominous later in the film.The set design of Hadley Hope from the standard cut has a shock value of this colony after the post-destruction of what happened to the colony. To the fusion reactors, tight spaces were used where the colonists were brought to be harvested, and the tight vents were where Bishop (Played by Lance Henriksen) had to connect to the satellite panel to call for help. The animatronics in the film with the Facehuggers look just as good as the recent Alien Romulus film, but the limited visibility makes that Medlab scene very intense. The costume design is equally on par with the designs of H. R. Giger, although this time, it has a more skull-like design and bony structure than what we see in the Hive Colony.The acting of Ripley in this film is fantastic, and it shows her character development from brave- scared in the first film to scared with PTSD- to a badass character in this film. To Newt (Carrie Henn), whose iconic scream helped create the film's mother-and-daughter theme. Private Hudson (Bill Paxton) plays a small but recognizable role that will be remembered for his iconic sentences, giving us both weight and understanding of his mental status before his death. Corporal Hicks (Michael Biehn), while his character at first is part of the background of the multiple marines, we come to understand him as a character being righteous as well understanding to not fall under pressure, something that is pretty impressive as well giving some alluding towards Hicks and Ellen's possible Romance which (sadly Alien 3 never did).Burke's (Paul Reiser) portrayal of one of many employees of Weyland Yutani being one of the most corrupt individuals that would even sell out people to their deaths before acknowledging they are 100% at fault, only seeing the monetary value, and it quite reflective of today with corporations with their CEOs doing some messed up things. Lieutenant Gorman (Willam Hope) is one of those characters who doesn't say many words in the film; however, there are a lot of visual movements and actions he does in the movie that redeem him in the later half of the film. Private Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein) is one of these characters, and her Mucha Macha (Macho, please make that the female version of the word), whose lover dies in the film by multiple Aliens.The sound design with the weapons is so satisfying with the sounds from the slow beeping of the movement radar and the soldering and melting tool that is extremely slow but effective in giving us suspense to the slow and eerie sounds of the Alien Queen plopping Eggs with the addition of the slow camera pan to have the reveal of the queen, with its yucky mucus sounds. To the metal groaning and the explosions whistling in the wind.Overall, James Cameron knows how to direct films with emotional weights, intense action scenes to moments of terror and commotion. In ALIENS (1986), these emotional weights are evident in the character development of Ripley, the bond between Ripley and Newt, and the moral dilemmas faced by the characters. Now knowing the Alien Franchise would stay in this limbic state between these two films in the future entries, we now know there's a third entry that fits this horse trifecta perfectly in the middle that being the mix of both movie Alien Romulus, later Alien films tried to get the magic of these films 3 & resurrection. Still, while they have faults, they aren't the worst thing the franchise has seen because it's one of the few franchises that keeps giving us bangers.ALIENS (1986) stands as a master class of a film, released almost a decade after the first film. It remains a momentous occasion in cinematic history, with its unique set designs, sounds, costumes, and VFX work that still impress to this day. While the VFX may show signs of its age, it only adds to the film's nostalgic charm, reminding us of the action films of its era.I give ALIENS (1986) a 10/10; it is the Perfect sequel to ALIEN (1979) and ALIEN: Romulus.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Aliens"" (1986) - A Thrilling Action-Packed Sequel","James Cameron's ""Aliens"" takes the slow-burn horror of the original and amps it up into a full-blown action spectacle. While it shifts the tone from horror to action, it does so without losing the tension and fear that made the first film so effective. This is a sequel that not only matches its predecessor but, in many ways, surpasses it.Sigourney Weaver returns as Ripley, delivering an Oscar-nominated performance that adds new layers to her character. This time, Ripley is not just a survivor but a protector, driven by a maternal instinct to save the young girl, Newt, from the xenomorphs. Weaver's portrayal of Ripley is both fierce and empathetic, solidifying her status as one of the greatest action heroes in cinema history.The film's pacing is relentless, with Cameron expertly balancing character development with intense action sequences. The marines, led by Michael Biehn's Hicks, Bill Paxton's Hudson, and the unforgettable Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein), provide a diverse and likable cast of characters who are each given moments to shine.The special effects, particularly the practical effects and miniatures, are top-notch and hold up remarkably well. The final showdown between Ripley and the Alien Queen is one of the most iconic scenes in movie history, showcasing Cameron's ability to create spectacle without sacrificing story.""Aliens"" is a rare sequel that lives up to the original, offering a thrilling and emotionally satisfying continuation of the story.

This is how you do a sequel,"If you love movies you have to see this. It's a classic from the genius of James Cameron. The perfect sequel to one of the most perfect films of all time.Back when James Cameron did 'art house' films he made this. It has all the grit of the original film but takes it in an entirely new direction, one that I personally favor over the original. The only negative I can say about this film is that Cameron never returned to the franchise (and what a shame that was). The queen alien will forever be one of the most iconic monsters in all film history, along with Ripley, and Sarah Connor they make up the baddest most amazing females in cinema history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Is it better than the original?

Aliens Smaliens,"The first Alien by Ridley Scott is amazing. Tense and scary as hell. The alien enemy is terrifying because it's unpredictable and hides in the shadows. You don't really know what it can or cannot do. It could come from anywhere and get you. It's like Jaws in that way. The first one. It's a solitary unknown creature. What is more frightening then the unknown? Well, James Cameron doesn't agree with me obviously. Aliens destroys the terror the first movie created by having multiple aliens in the film that you can fully see and can be killed easily by macho men and women carrying giant weapons. Compared to the first movie this is like a cartoon. No scares of any kind. Silly action and explosions. And the characters are stereotypes. Ridley Scotts characters were believable and grounded. Especially Ripley. Cameron turns Ripley into an unbelievable person like what Stallone did with Rambo. In the first movie you believe the character. In the sequels you dont. The character changes and becomes a tough one liner talking cliche. Cameron is a terrible screenwriter. How and why do so many people flock to his movies I just don't know. This one especially is annoying because Ridley Scotts movie was so good. Aliens smaliens. This movie sucks.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

8.3? Pretty good but not 8.3 material.,"Ridley Scott's Alien is a masterclass in science-fiction suspense, and this film was not that.Aliens is an awesome action thriller, but I think 8.3 is a tiny bit too high.Once again, Sigourney Weaver is amazing, that Oscar nomination is very well deserved.I have a complaint about Aliens, it is too long, padded scenes that lengthen the runtime and ruin the pacing.But once again, the special effects were unbelievable, and this movie is just as scary as the first one.The space scenes were insanely gorgeous, the cinematography was amazing once again, it's rooted with action.I'm gonna give it an A.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nearly Perfect,"The ONLY blemish for me was the review board. Surely Ripley would've mentioned the special order MUTHUR had for ""science officer eyes only"". Remember. Gather specimen. All other priorities rescinded. Crew expendable.

"Predictable, Boring Shoot'em Up","This movie really influenced the trend of pointless sequels and mindless action slogs. It's like a marvel movie with quippy one-liners and one dimensional characters. It rehashes every plot point from the first but does it far less intelligently. The xenomorphs are expendable cannon fodder and of course the corporate guy is the twist villain I knew it the minute he said ""we're not all bad you know"" at the beginning of the film. The child actor is a misguided attempt to throw emotional stakes into the film and I felt every predictable beat to be highly manipulative. Having a queen as the ""big bad"" at the end doesn't really track with a parasitic species and cheapens the power of the regular Xenomorphs, who don't come off as very intelligent either. The military glamorization was very reminiscent of top gun and the capitalist themes in the first film are reduced to parody. In terms of plot it doesn't make any sense for the corporate guy to ask Sigourney Weaver to come back they already knew what they were going to encounter. Mindless, pointless, and lessens a classic film, it also had a bad influence on the direction of Hollywood in general. Cameron can make a good sequel as shown by Terminator 2, but he shows a lack of appreciation for what made the first film so great.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Much better than Alien,"Since this movie was directed by James Cameron, I knew I'm going to like it and I wasn't disappointed. This movie is much better than the first part. First of all it's more realistic, all those spaceships and Aliens looked very realistic even compared to a nowadays movies. Also, I noticed that the similar robot which Ellen Ripley was controlling, also was used in The Matrix Reloaded, only in Aliens it looked more realistic. This movie was more creepy and intense too. Aliens looked really powerful this time so there was some of the scariest movie moments I've seen. Actually it kinda reminds me of The Terminator, both movies have powerful looking villains and similar creepy atmosphere.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Intense!,"Next to ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""The Godfather Part II"" the best sequel ever made!Take the tension from ""Alien"" and add to that some serious kick ass marines, the result is ""Aliens"". And my God, what a fine movie this! In some ways it's even more scary then ""Alien"", the tension is build up perfectly! The action is simply awesome. Letting marines fight the aliens was one of the best ideas in movie history.The characters are terrific. The marines are very cool characters and are portrayed brilliantly by the actors of course especially by Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton as the hyperactive but entertaining Pvt. Hudson. Sigourney Weaver is a great leading lady, Ripley is truly one of the strongest female characters of all time. I also liked Paul Reiser a lot in this one and let's not forget to mention Lance Henriksen as the android Bishop.James Horner delivers his masterpiece with the soundtrack. It's too bad it was cut in criminally. The music suits the movie perfectly.The movie is a lot of things at the same time: Scary, action packed, tense, funny and entertaining. The combination of everything is perfect.It's too bad that some of the visual effects are heavily outdated these days but it doesn't ruin the movie by far. The aliens on the other hand look better then ever, especially the queen is a great piece of work. And so are the costumes and weapons.There isn't much more I can say about this movie. All I can say is; see this movie now! Or if you have seen it before; watch it again! Is there anything I don't like about this movie? No, it's nothing short of perfect and it is one of my favorite movies of all time.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Still one of the best action movies of all times,"Alien and Aliens are movies belonging to two different genres: horror and thriller respectively. The tension in the first film was palpable right from the beginning. There were creepy sound effects mixed in with the space music that made the exploration scenes really tense. The Alien was a killing machine. The sequel trades the tension in for gunfire and explosions, while the titular Aliens are much more vulnerable this time around.The writing is of mixed quality. Most of the lines uttered by the marines in the first half of the film are horrible. I understand that the creators were trying to make the marines out as macho grunts, but what they ended up with are exaggerated gestures and cheesy meaningless lines made out of misused army lingo. ""Fire in the hole"" does not mean actual fire in an actual hole. Right at the beginning, there's a fake-out scene where something bad happens but turns out to be a dream - a hated cliché. The writing is better in the first movie.Nonetheless, the characters are fun and memorable. The film is filled with brilliant little bits, like a guy wakes up from hibernation and his first action is to put a cigar in his mouth. Sigourney Weaver is back of course as the strongest female lead of all time. She is both strong but vulnerable, giving the character realism and relatability. Paul Reiser as the villain is exceptional. His villainy feels realistic and the way it is revealed over the course of the film feels natural. A little adorable girl Newt is played by Carrie Henn. Newt is a cute kid, with the value of her acting varying from line to line, as you'd expect. Either way, she does not talk a lot. Aliens is famous for Bill Paxton's appearance. He overacts a bit, but remains very entertaining. Everyone's dialogue is a little corny, but nobody in this film is bad.The music is not as tense and integrated with the film as in the first film but nonetheless Horner created an iconic theme with a core of snare drums and metallic percussion.World design is one of the facets that is improved in the sequel. There are painstakingly built colony buildings, various machines and of course the Sulaco ship model. A lot of it is primarily found in the Directors' Cut, which some people do not like, but I would highly recommend it if you're into world building. Although CRT screens may look outdated, their size and static just adds to the creepy atmosphere. The Aliens themselves move a bit clunky, but the design is still impressive, and most importantly, no CGI effects were used. The editing is skillfully executed to portray the creatures as realistically as possible. These practical effects ensure that the movie ages well. Yes, occasionally you can clearly see that something is a miniature, but that is still much better than the blurry computer effects of later years.There are some strange visual issues. Sometimes mockup models are superimposed onto a background, presumably using green-screen, and that does not look good. There is an outline visible around the objects, which just looks weird. Remarkably enough, the first film did not have this problem nearly as much, as it did not try to add so many effects with moving vehicles.Aliens has some of the most quoted memorable lines but also many dumb ones. The music is iconic. The action is great, albeit at the cost of tension. Despite the flaws, the atmosphere and the characters are so good that Aliens can rightfully be called one of the best action movies of all time, as well as one of the best sci-fi movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A classic,"What can I say, what a classic! Throughout the years, Aliens has remained one of my top five movies of all time, and despite having been filmed in 1986, has aged remarkably well.It's a brilliant story, and while I have no intention of giving anything away, Ripley's return to LV-426 with a kick-ass compliment of marines sets the stage just nicely for what would prove to be an epic showdown.While James Cameron is arguably one of the better directors out there, I consider his earlier works, such as this, Terminator, The Abyss and T2, to be far superior to his more recent releases.Amidst an otherwise dull sky for the aliens franchise, this is the star that shines brightest for me. Highly recommended!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Best sequel of all time,"Almost all sequels fall prey to one of two pitfalls: either they simply rehash the original, or they try to be too different and lose all the things that made the original good. Jim Cameron's Aliens strikes a perfect balance, retaining everything that was cool in Alien (1979) while still taking the film to an entirely new level. (Action as opposed to horror)This film really does have it all: spine-chilling suspense, pulse-pounding action, beautiful (in a eerie, gooey way) scenery, colourful and memorable characters, an intelligent script, superb direction, believable acting, thrilling music, and special effects that still look AWESOME, even in today's CGI-infested world.This is one of the only sequels I can think of that actually surpasses the original.

My all-time favorite movie,"Yes, Alien is a master piece, but this one is my favorite.
The music, the plot, the military industry futuristic, the corporation, the cast, memorable and personalities given to the characters that you end up loving, the lines (Get away from her you b**** Game over man, Game over. How did they cut the power? they're animals),the queen, the tremendous Lance Henriksen, and damn the gun sounds.
It takes the great work from Ridley and respecting the original, not copying it, takes it to a whole different level.
When you get to know that the cast went through military training and Sigourney was kept away because she was shooting some other movie, but also to get the feeling of being a 'strange body'. And the scenes where the actor(s) were not told what would happen to capture real reactions.

Great movie!,I have been watching the movie since I was a kind and even after probably about 50-100 viewings I can still watch it and enjoy it very much. James Camerson directed this one and kind of changed it into more of an action movie instead of a horror movie which I was kind of disappointed about.This movie takes place after the first one following the Ellen Ripley the only surivor from the first movie. She is recruited by the marines to help them with the same possible aliens that may have taken over a terraforming colony.This movie is awesome I will always love it. I like all the films in the series. Aliens resurrection is where they kind of lost it. Watch thie movie,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Final Fronteer Warfare,"As much as I loved the first film I love this film even more. Believe it or not this film is actually my second favorite film of all time, I've seen this when I was about 11 and I still love it even today. This wasn't just a film it was a phenomenon as well as one unforgettable experience. It really set the bar form most sci-fi visual mediums we have now like TV shows (Battlestar Galatica revival, EXO Squad, and the criminally underrated Space, Above, and Beyond)as well as became a big influence on video games (Contra, Gears of War, Halo, Dead Space). This film gave us a new way of looking at sci-fi, it was final frontier sci-fi at it's best where it looked futuristic, realistic, believable and accessible.The world is great, this idea of a military of the future let alone in space, the technology that accompanies it. Spaceships, the weapons which look like advanced models of the ones we have now, portable flame units and my the pulse rifles, the sound of the rifles is awesome. The concept of artificial terror forming which gives us the power to make any planet we want habitable. However my favorite technology is the Power Loader, it was the first time I've ever seen a mecha ever, it's basically a simple construction vehicle nothing special in that world but in my eyes just the way it moved and worked I waned to drive one of those things.Music by James Horner one of my favorite composers is great, the score is just fantastic it's just has that exciting and epic feel to it.The effects and production value are superb because it's all practical most from my favorite effects guy the late great Stan Winston. Nothing was half baked the amount of detail in construction they really put a hell of a lot of effort and it shows. I love the dark atmosphere, just the use of limited light and darkness almost gives the film a slight Gothic foreboding sensibility to it as if there could be danger hiding behind one corner or another, you wouldn't know it will hit you until it's too late. The fact that there is more than one Zenomorph in this film and one new one which is the Queen Alien, it is the most gigantic intimidating monster I've ever seen it scared me when I was a kid and still makes me nervous ever time I see it.All that makes the danger all the more increased and puts you on red alert the whole way through. Usually with one monster you have many opportunities to evade but when it comes to an army of them your chances are slim. The way there handled, their behavior they were primal but not stupid. The fight with them was made similar to the Vietnam war and the Zenomorphs were sort of made to be like the Viet Cong who utilized gorilla tactics to bring down their opponents and undermine the high technology they have. The film of course also has that little underline message on humanity versus corruption and dehumanization. Demonstrated from the parallel between the evil destructive Zenomorphs and the unfeeling, cold blooded, destructive Weyland company that is willing to commit murder and breach ethical boundaries in both science and humanity all to make a fast profit.There are a lot of memorable things that were scary like the use of the portable radar and the sound it makes really put me on the edge of my seat, however one part of the film made me jump when Hicks looks up at the ceiling and sees a whole horde of Zenomorphs. As a kid that actually scarred me because I remembered my house had an attic I was afraid those things might be crawling up there. Down to the action sequences which are great their well choreographed, from seeing Ripley going all out in an alien hive but my favorite and it's no surprise is the fight with Ripley in the power loader against the Queen which is one of my favorite fights ever.The character are colorful, interesting as well as memorable. Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein) a really tough as nails woman with the attitude to go with it, she's awesome my third favorite character and one of the most memorable female fatales in movies ever in my book. Dwane Hicks (Michael Bien) is my second favorite because he's the most level headed leader sort of a calm authoritative figure but also just a bad ass, from what he says to his actions. But of course my favorite no surprise is Ellen Ripley (Sigorney Wever) her character helped set the bar for the female fatales to come (Buffy, Betrix Kiddo, Lara Croft, you name it) and she's still number one in my book. From her leadership ability toward the Space Marines which is great she should of been a Space Marine Commander, or even a Commando seeing her going against the Zenomorphs and kicking ass just shows she's a bad ass as well. However it's the emotion she carries which makes her feel all so human. You can't help but feel for her from what she sees and feels from her facial and emotional expressions you see she is a person that is driven by internal rage, from her feelings toward the heartless Weyland company she worked for, her post traumatic experiences, the fact she has nothing really to come back to since her daughter is now deceased. The only thing she really has left is her unstoppable determinations toe save and protect everything that is good from evil of any form because she still believes in the value of humanity, that it's always worth fighting for.Aliens is an experience that take you to space, above, and beyond.Rating: 4 stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

My favorite,"I haven't written any comment in ages, so here's my tribute to this fine piece of art: It was the first horror movie I saw (when I was twelve), and not only did it freak me out (in a good way), it was also very interesting.To this day, I must have seen this movie at least 20 times. I love it every time.Weaver's performance was absolutely great. How can we compare today's chick's action movies with these ""old-school"" classics? It's not a fair comparison. Back in the days, the actresses were chosen for their ability, unlike today, where ""cuteness"" and ""hotness"" rule who's in and who's out. It's a skill vs beauty contest, and my vote goes to skill. Definitely.So, if you haven't seen this movie, if you like action/horror movies, if you think Jessica Biel is a good actress, and if you like Aeon flux... you're scratching the bottom of the barrel, so please forget about that ""crap"" and go get this great great movie.It's my favorite of all 4.How do you know when a movie is really really good?

Better than the Original; A Masterpiece,"Before I go into the review, let me talk about the series as a whole. Every entry of this series was made by a different director. This is also true of the Mission: Impossible series, as you may remember if you're a film buff or if you read my very first official film review. But as much as I love the Mission: Impossible directors and although the movies as a whole are superior to the Alien movies, the directing talent of the latter series is ridiculous. In order, you have Ridley Scott, James Cameron, David Fincher, and Jean-Pierre Jeunet, all of whom have at least one movie on this list. How Alien: Resurrection turned out to be such a mess is still a mystery to me; yes, a lot can happen and people can be put on and kicked off and productions can be basically a toxic waste zone. But you still have not only the director of Amelie but bloody Joss Whedon on your movie. How do you screw that up? Okay: enough ranting. Time to get onto the review of one of the finest action movies ever made. The core of the film, of course, is Sigourney Weaver's Ripley, still the finest female character as far as action is concerned. In the first film, she is not the focal character, as the audience was meant to be surprised when she was the only one that survived. It is a good narrative trick that worked perfectly, but I much prefer to see her front and center.This movie knows how to walk the balance between pure action and emotional scenes. This lends the movie weight and combined with a sensible plot that is natural sequel escalation at its best as well as some of the finest writing I've seen in the action-sci-fi genre...makes the movie not just a boorish actionfest but a highly calculated yet unrestrained cold-blooded action monster. Your blood pumps and so does your mind; you feel a chill down your spine. The gravitas this movie has makes the action better and more piercing... not less. Take notes, Michael Bay.There are no badly-written or badly-acted characters in this movie. That is a key version why people love this film so much and why people hate Alien 3, which killed off all the supporting cast. My personal favorite is Newt, a prime example of how to do a kid character right. She has the real kind of childish energy. It's not shallow and all 'gee, golly, mister.' It's raw and deep; optimistic but not euphoric. Say what you want about Cameron's writing ability (though I don't think anyone argues that this script is snappy and spectacular), but he has a talent of getting into the minds of character, particularly emotional. Everything they should be feeling at any given moment, they are feeling.I love Newt because you feel the vulnerability and despair she's going through, but it does not turn her into a straight 'rescue' character. She does need to be rescued, but you don't mind because by that time, she and Ripley have formed such a bond that you feel like it is justified. You are with Ripley the whole time instead of seeing it as a film going through points, which I appreciate. The two do share a lot of nice little scenes that make the movie more than it would have been otherwise. It is kinda a shame that the child who played Newt decided not to become an actress. It's her choice, yes, but she did a mighty good job here. She expresses a whole range of emotions and comes out being as great of a kid character as Ripley is an adult character.The themes expressed in this movie are interesting. Critics often accuse Cameron of not having nuance. I personally would argue that, for the most part, it is the critics who don't have the nuance. Even blatant environmental films like Avatar are deeper than they would appear to be, if only slightly.Films like this are brimming with thoughtful thematic substance. (As a side note, I can't be the only one who laughs when I see 'some thematic elements' as an MPAA rating. I'm like, 'Yes, I would hope a movie I or my (nonexistent) kid watches would have theme. I would like very much if it were not an endless stream of nonsense.') Anyways, think about what happens in the film. An advanced military force is brought into to an unknown planet and is wiped out (except for Ripley, of course). No spoilers there. Why are they wiped out? They have advanced tech? Because they don't know the terrain. they don't know what they're up against. They lack wisdom. Now... if that doesn't sound like a lot of wars, particularly those fought by my country, then you need to get your hearing checked. Cameron himself has explicitly said that he based this film on Vietnam.If you want to delve into that, go right ahead. If you want to just sit back and breathe in one of the most viscerally-stimulating movies of the decade, go right ahead. You have a choice. As all good action movies give you. And this is more than a good action movie. This is one of the greatest films of the decade. It even got Weaver an acting nom at the Oscars. In action movies, that. Doesn't. Happen. Yes, it was the eighties, but still. From beginning to end, this is a resonant and thrilling film. You will feel different after watching it. You should feel different after watching it. It is an emerald in a sea of rocks. If it were up to me, this would perhaps be THE definitive movie of the decade.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Review of the director's cut,"This review had to be chopped a bit to fit under the maximum word limit.""They mostly come at night...mostly.""The vessel drifts eerily through the vacant outer reaches of space. There is total silence as the opening credits begin to spread across the screen, and then the words JAMES CAMERON ignite with an overwhelming sense of joy. Yes, this is a James Cameron film, perhaps the way he originally envisioned ""Alien"" (1979), or at least thought he could improve upon it.Many critics and moviegoers often consider Cameron's film, released in 1986, superior to the first film. Because the two films are quite different in approach to the entire concept of aliens, it's hard to compare them. Instead it's quite easy to say that they share a deep chemistry of sorts, whereas each entry compliments the other's own flaws. ""Alien"" was a rather slow, brooding, dark study of humans abandoned in an unnatural, man-made environment, faced with a deadly foe; mother nature's crème de le crème of big bad monsters. There was only one alien in the first film, and it stalked them mercilessly, unseen. Even by the end of the film there was much mystery surrounding the alien itself. In short, ""Alien"" was a horror film. ""Aliens"" is not.""Aliens"" is a cold-blooded, terrifying action movie, pumped full of Cameron's own ever-present unique blend of adrenaline, machoism and suspense. Its lead hero is actually a heroine, the only returning character from the first film, Ellen Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver as one of the most reluctant screen characters of all time. The company that owned the Nostromo space ship she blew up at the end of ""Alien"" saves her. It's over 50 years later, her daughter is dead, and everything she has come to know and recognize in her life disappears in a matter of minutes when she is awoken from a deep sleep and informed of all this by Burke (Paul Reiser). Chairmen of the company who take away her pilot's license, believing she is crazy and delusional, mentally disturbed by whatever happened on the Nostromo, debrief her. Days go by until activity is recorded on the planet from the first film -- which is now colonized. The planet where Ripley's crew originally discovered the alien that made its way onto the ship and murdered everyone...except her.Burke offers Ripley an enticing deal: If she goes to the planet with a group of marines, they will give her back the freedom she desires. Cautiously, she agrees, and is shipped out with a group of Colonel Marines, including Corporal Dwayne Hicks (Michael Biehn), Private Hudson (Bill Paxton), Lt. Gorman (William Hope), Private Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein), and Sgt. Apone (Al Matthews). After arriving at their destination the crew soon realizes that the activity is indeed related to the extra-terrestrial. There are no civilians in sight -- it seems everyone has disappeared. The single survivor is Newt (Carrie Henn), a brave young girl who has been hiding in the ventilation shafts of the colony for, apparently, quite some time.The action soon begins as the aliens wake up from their slumber within the walls of the colony and attack their new guests. Ripley, relying upon her own experiences with one of the creatures, leads the crew as the casualties soon amount and revelations are made about the species.James Cameron is one of the most visionary directors of all time, a man whose idea for ""The Terminator"" was sparked by the single image of an endoskeleton rising from fiery flames. His ""Terminator"" is arguably his finest masterpiece. Even to this day, with ""T2,"" ""The Abyss,"" and ""Titanic"" under his belt, it is rivaled but not surpassed.To be fair most people seem to think ""Aliens"" is a super-fast roller coaster-ride of a movie, when in fact it is also a very long film -- the director's cut roughly two and a half hours long, longer than the first film. Then why does it seem so short to so many viewers? Because of its direction. Cameron's dark atmosphere retains the vision of the original ""Alien"" but the scope and ideas are entirely different; this is a film about shooting, yelling, running, and lots of blood and guts, which isn't to say it's a stupid film...just a very fun one.Cameron has commented on the film's Vietnam-related themes, although they're rather outlandish. To be sure, the film does indeed use war as a backdrop. The film's tagline was ""This Time It's War!"" -- something Cameron claims he made up after deciding to promote his movie as a war picture, not a slow-moving epic in the vein of the original.Both films are amazing in their own right, and about equal in comparison in many different ways, but what Cameron does is improve upon the first film's action, acting and aliens in general. The first movie, aptly titled ""Alien"" (as it was not about any more than one of the species), has far better landscapes, and although both directors are wonderful Scott is generally better at evoking the paranoia of space. Cameron doesn't do that because he doesn't need to. The acting by all involved is top-notch, with Paxton especially stealing the scenes as the whiny and constantly worried (but never quite annoying) marine. The writing is fairly good, given the material, and the action is some of the best you'll ever see.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best of the Alien films,"Certainly the best of the Alien films. This movie is great on so many levels. One of the best SciFi / Horror films ever. It is one of the best Female Hero movies of all time.

And it was certainly the first time I ever saw a evil creature pop out of someones chest.But the second one was absolutely fantastic. More monsters, more explosions, improved she-hero and even a bit of comedy sprinkled in there (thanks to Bill Paxton's character).This is still one of my favorite movies to watch in my Home theater room due to the brilliant filming and sound.One last thing...Sigourney Weaver holding heavy firearm...very sexy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Standard uniform for hyper-sleep?,"It was nice to see that 57 years later the standard uniform for women in hyper-sleep aboard spacecraft is still t-shirt and panties! Other highlights include the inexplicable behavior of the crew (apparently in the future Marines are fond of sassing their superior officers, and yet need Sigourney Weaver to take over and start making all the decisions) and the recycled plot device of Cyborg-sympathetic-to-the-monster. Luckily, the nice guy from the future in The Terminator is there to fall in love with Ripley; he of course has experience with cyborgs as well as director James Cameron.

Masterpiece by James Cameron,"Just about everything about this movie; the cast, action, suspense, special effects, storyline, was just as good if not better than Alien. This was an overall tremendous effort by James Cameron. The only area where I thought this film lacked was in suspense. Don't get me wrong, there are certain scenes that will truly give you goose bumps, but overall there isn't that same eerie feeling as the first film. In ""Alien"", there was just one alien, and you didn't know where and when it was going to show up. In Aliens, there is a whole army of these gruesome E.T.'s, almost to the point of overkill. Also, after watching the first film, we know what these Aliens look like and are capable of. Still, this film is a classic that combines the best of the sci-fi/horror/action genres.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The perfect thriller,"James Cameron's masterpiece?Of course the mix of commando movie, action movie and horror movie in a high suspense setting works well. With the impressive sets that give the film its atmosphere: the artistic direction of the first franchise (Alien, 1978) and the preparatory work for the future Abyss (1989) with the station, the corridors, the tunnels and the whole technological arsenal.But the film is especially successful in its quiet moments, when the camera pans, sneaks or shows us the scenery, the quiet times of the hyper sleep, the noise of the equipment or the chains of cranes. With the right sound effects and the good music of James Horner, subtle (which is rarely his strong point).This longer version is more coherent and allows to delve more into the characters.Another quality of this film, and of the franchise, is not to show the monsters in an ostensible and permanent way. We don't see them very often and their presence is evoked through Giger's powerful sets or through stealthy inserts, or through screens (motion detectors, cameras).When will there be a reboot of this franchise (which may very well exist at the same time as the Prometheus spinoff). But beware of the computer generated images that will allow to multiply the ugly beasts endlessly on the screen: to be used sparingly.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Personally I think Sig.

"Different concept than the original-fantastic idea,but hindered by some minor flaws","One of the main problem of many horror movie franchises is their repetitive nature.Many sequels to horror films,successful enough to spawn them, are usually a rehash of the original with few new ideas.If they decide to take the franchise in a different direction,however,there is a very high chance that it will be an even greater failure(like ""Halloween 3"",for example).In this regard,Cameron chose the second path and I must say,""Aliens"" is a very well made and entertaining movie.It's a little more action oriented than the original,but that doesn't mean,there aren't suspenseful scenes,either.Unlike the original,Ripley is clearly the protagonist of the film from the very beginning.Her character is further developed and that aspect of the movie was done perfectly.The movie has a higher budget than the first and it is utilized very well.We see more of the aliens and we get more background on them.As I mentioned before,there are more action scenes,which are done very well.What I didn't like about the film,was that at some points it was kinda over-the-top and cheesy.I have seen this in other Cameron films,such as ""Terminator 2:Judgment Day"",but the cheesy moments are a distinct part of ""The Terminator"",but in ""Aliens"" they stick out like a sore thumb.This is most distinct in the scene where the marines awake from cryogenic sleep.I get,that their behavior is supposed to explain to us,that they don't know what they're up against,but I think Cameron went a little too far.Overall,""Aliens"" is a very well made and entertaining film and while it's not better than the original,it's definitely a worthy sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the best movies ever.,"This movie simply rocks. I think it was unfair of Cameron to make an Alien movie this great because it's a hard movie to follow up as the next two Alien movies prove. James Cameron knows what makes a great movie, it's like he's a movie fan more than a director because he knows what we want. Instead of having a few Aliens which would have been acceptable (because the first one had only one) we get treated to hundreds of aliens and marines with lots of guns!

"Great sequel, exhilarating film","The first alien movie, Alien, was good, scary and an acceptable starter for the declining Alien series. The first part was great. Yet the second one in my opinion, blew the first one away. The first one had a lot of mystery, deception and action, while the second one took all of that and expanded it to another level of aliens and action. Aliens is almost a non-stop action film, with a crazy and intense plot behind it. It's almost genius, this film and it takes a lot of potential to make a movie like this one. Yes, the special effects were pretty funny, but in all, none of that matters since the movie was so damn good. It's violent, and it's gritty and if you were watching this with your girlfriend, you'd get a lot of freaks and scares from her. It's intense, and brilliant. It's still a wonder to me on how James Cameron to do this film, and then to something like Titanic eleven years later.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Sets the bar for all other sci-fi actioners to aim for.,"Aliens is as good a film as there has been over the last 30 years, better than almost everything that preceded it and 99.99% of what has come since.After the shambles that occurred aboard the space vessel Nostromo in the original Alien film, the only survivor Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and her cat floated aimlessly for many years in the escape pod until they were found. 57 years in fact. This meant that Ripley had actually outlived her daughter and all known relatives, so she was handed back to her employer as the nearest thing to next of kin. After some initial questioning the company decide to pin the disaster on Ripley, conveniently ignoring all references to a 9 foot tall drooling creature with acid blood as the fanciful ramblings of a lunatic.(There is no reference to whether the cat was charged also.) Not long after her return to the real world, Ripley's former employer sends a representative Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) to ask for help. It turns out that the deserted planet on which the alien life form was found had been colonized, and until recently regular contact was made with the 70 families entrusted with trying to make the planet more inhabitable based on the planet.But recently all contact was lost After much soul searching Ripley agrees to go on the search mission, as long as the one priority is to wipe out any non-human located. She joins a bunch of bonehead soldiers, along with Burke, and soon finds that one of the crew is an ""artificial person"" named Bishop (good old robotic Lance Henricksen). Ripley, remembering the fun aboard the Nostromo, is none too pleased.The soldiers are not actually the normal faceless mob who happen to be wearing the same colour, they are all lead by Sergeant Apone, a cigar chomping black guy with a booming voice who leads by example.Once on the planet surface the ""ferry"" ship maintains safe distance and the ground crew proceed in a massive armoured troop transport vehicle, initially everything goes smoothly. There are signs of struggle, no evidence though of survivors, and everyone performs in a militaristic (natch) and precise manner. After being deemed ""safe"" Ripley, Burke, Bishop and the mission's inexperienced overseeing Lieutenant head in.Out of the blue contact is made, though not deliberately. A young girl, perhaps 9 or 10 is located on surveillance equipment, after a brief chase Ripley grabs the girl. It appears that she has been surviving on solely her wits for many weeks by darting in and out of nooks and tunnels to escape notice. Her name is Newt, and she and Ripley immediately bond under pressure in a sort of proxy Mother/Daughter relationship.– - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – -The team proceed on into the facility to search for survivors or otherContact! Unseen and largely untraceable, the Aliens set upon the soldiers. Ripley, again aboard the troop carrier decides to step up as the Lieutenant proves useless. She saves the day (for some) and from here on in it is basically ""Ripley & Co"".Safe for now, the survivors formulate what seems a simple plan. Of course this is almost immediately compromised and the remainder of the film has them warding off the Aliens, and internal forces at times while they attempt to desperately get themselves off the planet safely.There are simply too many classic things to mention here but the frantic pace steps up yet again once they discover that automatic emergency measures have triggered the self destruct sequence and the whole facility is primed to blow soon. From here the last 40 minutes runs in practically real time, with an automated warning system calmly counting down till things go boom-boom. Ripley simply starts kickin' ass and taking names, and the final battle ends with a massive showdown that has become very well known for the 2 gangly female protagonists, one impossibly tall, gaunt and ferocious, the other an Alien-Queen.– - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – -The Aliens are far better realized this time round, the mechanics that run the head SFX are especially realistic, and there are some great lingering shots with Aliens and prey face to face.They are obviously more fluid and flexible, moving with disturbing ease and grace before unwinding to attack in savage fashion. They are single minded, vicious and - as it turns out - smart.The film is especially quotable even 20+ years on, and also features some great character performances, Beihn is strong in his role as the determined soldier (even though he doesn't have to do much but clench his jaw and look serious), Reiser is especially weasely and unlikable as Burke, and Newt does the job, that being simply to not be an annoying and distracting ""cutesie"" kid.But it is Paxton who steals the show as Hudson, the first half of his performance is all bravado and cockiness, but after he sees what they are up against he turns into the funniest whiner in a looong time.Aliens was ahead of its time in 1986, and I would argue that it still is, as even with all the CGI and high budget stuff being churned out these days nothing comes close to having the visual (and visceral) impact that Aliens still pulls off.Final Rating – 9.5 / 10. So near perfection it's ridiculous.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Bang bang shoot shoot, that's all","Not much story here, and the characters are indistinguishable except that one is a kid and one is Sigourney Weaver - otherwise it was hardly worth giving the soldiers names.In some shootout movies you can at least keep track of which one gets killed first and which one last, but not here. Similarly, the monsters are just wave after wave of targets to shoot at; after the thirty-fifth one it gets kind of repetitive. But if you like looking at explosions and flames, here they are.The child in this one serves the same function as the cat did in the original 1979 Alien, except that the cat was a better actor.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Aliens A Solid Sci-Fi Horror Sequel,"Aliens is a solid sci-fi horror sequel from director James Cameron whose admirable in making this movie. Cameron has show in all his movies his talent as filmmaker and this one is no different. Sigourney Weaver returns as Ripley set fifty years after the original which finds her character once again battling the nightmarish creature that killed her whole crew except this time there's more than one a lot more. Weaver is effective in the role and continues to be the best Ripley. The talented supporting cast are admirable in their roles including Michael Biehn, Carrie Henn, Lance Henriksen, Paul Reiser, and Bill Paxton. Some of them may have limited screen time but they make the best of their small parts in the movie. The rest of the cast are good in their roles too. The special effects are equally impressive especially for that time and the alien monster's still look terrifying including the Queen. The creature action is well executed and intense there's definitely more of it in this one than the original which made it feel a little more faster paced. Director James Cameron delivered on nearly everything that fans come to except from a good sequel by amping up the action, suspense, alien monsters, and body count which does make it a worthy sequel to the first one. Despite some flaws with character development the rest of the movie makes up for it. Overall Aliens is an entertaining sci-fi horror sequel with enough monster action, suspense, thrills, great special effects, terrifying villains, and exceptional performances from the cast (epecially Weaver and Biehn) who make this movie worth watching.

It is true that there are two Aliens-factions out there, one following the original Alien, Alien 3 and Resurrection, whereas the other group is a die-hard Aliens-follower and DESPISES the other movies in this series. I myself am part of the latter, but that is only AFTER I saw the series for myself and hence deduced that Aliens is such a powerful movie, it does not even need a prequel or further sequels!Agreeing with another reviewer, I found this movie very much lively and very much ""alive"" as it had so much I could personally relate to! The characters are extremely well-developed and well-cast..no, PERFECTLY cast!! Biehn and Paxton give their very best performances, Weaver is just excellent, Rieser is truly evil, and Henriksen is the only person who looks like an android anyhow!

Greatest action sci-fi movie ever,"In contrast to what the message before me says, i think the movie was great. I saw it in the 80's and i love it even today. This movie has depth, a good plot, good acting, and good direction from a person that rivals spielberg: James Cameron.But yes there are a few things that i had a problem with. I thought that the marines in general were not too believable because they were really loose and talked back to there superiors. If the marines did that today they would probably in the hospital with a concussion. Also, the whole ending sequence with the alien queen. I mean, does she have the ability to change her size on a moments notice!?!? One minute she's like 30 feet tall and the next she's 12 ft. (and squeezing in that small human only fitting stairwell in the dropship). and last but not least the flamethrower. During the alien ambush scene towards the end of the movie, Gorman tries to rescue vasquez from a group of aliens with a pistol!!!! Is he suicidal or just plain stupid??? They left behind a perfectly funcitioning flame thrower at operations, albeit it was half empty. but if it was me up there give me the flamethrower, hell, give me a sharp stick!!!Ok, with enough ranting aside, it was genuinely a good movie, with only minor flaws to the production. Alien 3 and Ressurection, those are movies with BIG flaws.And vasquez was the best, i loved her macho-ness. You have to understand her character to like her. Before joining the corps., Drake and her were both in prison. So there's not really much she would be afraid of.This will be my favorite movie for a long time.

5.7/10 - The Block-Busting Mindset That Made it All Mid,"*This review contains some spoilers to Alien, the first film in the series*Aliens is the sequel to the 1979 film Alien, and guess what, folks? Now everything is bigger, the stakes are higher etc etc. It goes like this, more or less: we go back to Ripley, the sole survivor of the Nostromo after the horrible massacre the Xenomorph did there. Now she wakes up and it's decades since she started hibernating. She's alone, The Company abandoned her, leaving her with the general sense that she should be grateful for not being sued after making the Nostromo destroy itself (they seemingly don't believe her story about the Xenomorph). However, it is not long until The Company needs her back - a colony on the planet where she claimed the Xenomorph ship was is now not responding to any sort of communication. Now Ripley has to face her nightmare-fuel once again.Look, I'm gonna get straight to the point. This film is the 80's version of an MCU film, mindset-wise. James Cameron has directed some of the biggest blockbusters of all time, so I guess he has a point there with his approach to filmmaking, but I really, really don't like what was done here. I mean, sure, I haven't been suffering through the whole film. In itself, it's okay. It's not ugly looking visually, the acting is not horrible, the writing isn't the worst thing in the universe. And yeah, monsters exploding, how fun and all. But god, it feels so...lifeless to me.We can start from just the general descension in quality - Cameron's cinematography is way less original or thrilling than Ridley Scott's. You can say the same about the set and the design. The sense of urgency, the tension and the horror the first film had are replaced with what feels like a generic action/sci-fi film. The intriguing motifs of sexual horror and questioning gender roles are replaced with...what, just the basic need to survive? Primal monstrosities and nothing more?And yeah, it doesn't have to carry on with the themes, the aesthetic, what made the first one so good. It really doesn't. But if it takes those things out of the equation, Aliens should at least replace them with something equal in its value. In my eyes, it doesn't. Really doesn't.I could keep on ranting about how Newt is flat and a little obnoxious sometimes, how I feel like the only reason Hicks is there is to provide some sexual tension, how it's hard to take stuff seriously when I feel how hard this film tries to sell. All of that. But honestly, it's nothing Hollywood hasn't seen before, nothing that was never done. I'm only disappointed since the first movie was actually good and this one is so mid.Stuff I liked...well, Ripley's struggle for recognition, the trauma she has to bear and the cold shoulder The Company gives her are quite relatable. I honestly think that this is the best part of the film, when we explore Ripeley's psyche and see her struggle. The queen concept is cool, though it's not taken too far. The camerawork, though not as half as good is what was done in Alien, is still somewhat decent, even good at times. But that's about it for me.So again, I don't despise this film as much as I hate the mindset that, in my opinion and from what I get from the film, was behind it. I could appreciate Cameron trying to do his own thing here, even if it failed, if only it felt like there was heart here and not only the effort to make this film the biggest blockbuster of this year or something. I'm feeling a 5.7/10 on this one. Yeah.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best sequel I've ever seen,"Aliens had a powerful build-up to its release. In 1979, Alien terrified audiences and is now hailed - rightly so - as one of the most important sci-fi and horror films of all time. Subsequently, in 1984, James Cameron released his powerful debut The Terminator. (If you discount his true debut, Piranha II. Eek.) While Alien proved how terrifying sci-fi can be, Terminator proved the same - but also how emotional it can be too. Aliens builds on the legacy of both its predecessor, and Cameron's own predecessor. He expertly explores the emotional back-stories of the characters that we just weren't given the time to do in Alien. But he doesn't forget what the sci-fi buffs and the horror fans want - plenty of action, plenty of screams and a grand spectacle. Aliens is, quite simply, the best sequel I've ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Story Continues From Ridley Scott's Alien....,"The last time we saw Ripley, she was in an escape shuttle, in hyper-sleep on a course to Earth.The story now continues from this point.Full Plot: Her shuttle is intercepted by a deep-space salvage team. They secure the shuttle and board it and find Ripley still alive in her cryo-tube. She is later revived and is told that she had been drifting in space for the last fifty-seven years. She inquires about her daughter but is told that she recently passed away from old age.At an interview before a panel of executives from her employer, the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, her testimony regarding the Alien is met with extreme skepticism as no physical evidence of the creature survived the destruction of the Nostromo. Ripley loses her space flight license as a result of her ""questionable judgment"" and learns that LV-426, the planet where her crew first encountered the Alien eggs, is now home to a terraforming colony.Some time later, Ripley is visited by Weyland-Yutani representative Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) and Lieutenant Gorman (William Hope) of the Colonial Marines, who inform her that contact has been lost with the colony on LV-426. The company decides to dispatch Burke and a unit of marines to investigate, and offers to restore Ripley's flight status and pick up her contract if she will accompany them as a consultant. Traumatized by her previous encounter with the Alien, Ripley initially refuses to join, but accepts when she realizes that the mission will allow her to face her fears, which had been plaguing her since her first encounter. Aboard the warship Sulaco she is introduced to the Colonial Marines, including Sergeant Apone (Al Matthews), Corporal Hicks (Michael Biehn), Privates Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein) and Hudson (Bill Paxton), and the android Bishop (Lance Henriksen), toward whom Ripley is initially hostile due to her previous experience with the android Ash aboard the Nostromo.The heavily-armed expedition descends to the surface of LV-426 via dropship, where they find the colony seemingly abandoned. Two living Alien facehuggers are found in containment tanks in the medical lab, and the only colonist found is a traumatized young girl nicknamed Newt (Carrie Henn). The marines determine that the colonists are clustered in the nuclear-powered atmosphere processing station. There they find a large Alien nest filled with the cocooned colonists. The Aliens attack and kill most of the unit, but Ripley rescues Hicks, Vasquez, and Hudson. With Gorman knocked unconscious during the rescue, Hicks assumes command and orders the dropship to recover the survivors, intending to return to the Sulaco and destroy the colony from orbit. However, a stowaway Alien kills the dropship pilots in flight, causing the vessel to crash into the processing station; subsequently, the surviving humans barricade themselves inside the colony complex.Ripley discovers that it was Burke who ordered the colonists to investigate the derelict spaceship where the Nostromo crew first encountered the Alien eggs, and that he hopes to return Alien specimens to the company laboratories where he can profit from their use as biological weapons. She threatens to expose him, but Bishop soon informs the group of a greater threat: the damaged processing station has become unstable and will soon detonate with the force of a thermonuclear weapon. He volunteers to use the colony's transmitter to pilot the Sulaco's remaining dropship to the surface by remote control so that the group can escape. Ripley and Newt fall asleep in the medical laboratory, awakening to find themselves locked in the room with the two facehuggers, which have been released from their tanks. Ripley is able to alert the marines, who rescue them and kill the creatures. Ripley accuses Burke of attempting to smuggle implanted Alien embryos past Earth's quarantine inside her and Newt, and of planning to kill the rest of the marines in hypersleep during the return trip. The electricity is suddenly cut off and numerous Aliens attack through the ceiling; Hudson, Burke, Gorman, and Vasquez are killed, and Newt is captured by the Aliens.Ripley and an injured Hicks reach Bishop and the second dropship, but Ripley is unwilling to leave Newt behind. She rescues Newt from the hive in the processing station, where the two encounter the Alien queen and her egg chamber. Ripley destroys most of the eggs, enraging the queen, who escapes by tearing free from her ovipositor. Closely pursued by the queen, Ripley and Newt rendezvous with Bishop and Hicks on the dropship and escape moments before the colony is consumed by the nuclear blast. Back on the Sulaco, Ripley and Bishop's relief at their narrow escape is interrupted when the Alien queen, stowed away on the dropship's landing gear, impales Bishop and tears him in half. Ripley battles the queen using an exosuit cargo-loader. The two of them tumble into a large airlock, which Ripley then opens, expelling the queen into space. Ripley clambers to safety and she, Newt, Hicks and the still-functioning Bishop enter hypersleep for the return to Earth.Epic is a small word to describe this film. The direction, background music and special effects is nothing short of ""out-of-this-world"". All the actors in the film excel in the roles given to them.Notable Actors: Lance Henriksen makes an impact as the android Bishop.William Hope is superb as Lieutenant William Gorman.Paul Reiser is outstanding as Carter J.

Excellent sequel that take the first movie to a whole new level,"If you've seen the first film, this movie is not the same at all. Alien (the first one) is a slasher thriller set on an isolated ship. As for Aliens itself is more of an action thriller. So it's like comparing Dead Space and Dead Space. Aliens deliver us more action, more suspense, and more aliens. It's a story about a rescue mission with a lot of gunfire, people die, and more aliens that you could ever dreamed of. It's also have more intense moments, more character development as you hate or love some of the character along the way. But if you think this is less scarier than Alien, well it's not. Aliens contains the same horror Alien gave us. It never gets old of seeing a baby Xenomorph jump to people face or people's chest bursting Aliens. So if you like Alien, but wish it to be more action packed, more scary, and more intense. Then this is the movie you've been waiting for.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

One of the best copies ever!,"When I first heard there was a sequel to ""Alien"" been made I thought that classic line from Douglas Adams' ""Hitch-Hikers Guide to the Galaxy"": ""Oh no! Not again!"" For what sequel has ever surpassed its original in quality and style? Or remotely matched it, for that matter?Well, ""Aliens"" did - with considerable style, aplomb and NERVE!What do I mean, ""nerve""?The ending of course!It's all over - just like the original was.Ripley killed the monster and got to safe haven - just like she did in the original.But the alien came along for the ride - just like it did in the original.Then there was another do or die fight - just like there was in the original.The monster was once more bested - just like in the original.And they all went to sleep with the camera zooming in on their faces - just like it did in the original.That's what I mean by nerve.And did James Cameron's near direct lifting of the original's ending spoil ""Aliens"" in the least?Definitely not.For what Cameron managed to do was turn the slow suspenseful plot of ""Alien"" into a hold-on-to-your-seat 5-gees roller-coaster ride. He managed to give us another side - another view - of the aliens and to help us to understand how tenacious the species is.As usual with Cameron films, the ""Special Edition"" gives even more depth to the original theatre release. I have both versions. I only ever watch the Special Edition. I have just one reservation about the Special Edition: there is one too many Hudson scenes - the one where he's blabbing on about all the weapons they're carrying on the drop ship; in the APC. It just goes on too long (Paxton improvising?) and for me weakens his character.Never mind.10 out of 10.(A footnote to sequels: a certain J K Rowling has surpassed each and every Harry Potter novel with the next one.

Excellent Special Effects means NO CGI!,"I really love James Cameron because he is truly a consummate artist, first and foremost. He is sensitive and perfection-seeking about all the right things and for all the right reasons as a director; to convincingly tell a good story and to create the human connection with the audience. He really wants the viewer to be transported by his films, which is exactly what a truly brilliant film does. Although this is a ""Sci-Fi"" film, he doesn't ""blind us with science."" Rather he chooses to give only important information at key points to move the story along. The viewer is never overwhelmed with too much information and the pacing never slows down trying to educate the audience about some heady scientific theory. I am so glad that he decided to make this film in the era that he did, B.C., (before computer generated special effects), because I think that is what really makes everything that much more visceral an experience when watching this film. The aliens are flesh and blood, (even if their blood is acidic!), and must be confronted on the material plane. I'm certain that these creatures would not be nearly as scary in CGI as they are in this film, dripping their goo everywhere. Well, case in point, Aliens 3. What a horrific flop and a total waste of everything, paper, film, time, money, talent,...ad infinitum. I actually walked out of the theater 20 minutes into that film and have since never watched it, even though it is included in the box set that I own. In my mind, it is so sub-par that I won't even acknowledge it as part of the franchise. But, then again, I don't like David Finchner's work in general. Enough said,... I have the ""Quadrilogy"" Collection of all the Alien films which includes excellent special features, such as behind-the-scenes peeks at how everything was crafted; sets, props, and aliens. It was really awesome to see how they built the sets and created the special effects! Any, no ALL film students should check out these special features on both this film and Ridley Scott's seminal Alien, which is the foundation work for Cameron's explosive sequel. You can see how Cameron identified the key elements and the core of Scott's film, ie., the physical and motivational qualities of the alien species, the overall condition of life for working-class humans, the corruption of ""the company"" that they work for, and the basic introduction of Ripley's character as sole survivor of the initial encounter with the alien. He then just found a viable continuation of this story within these established parameters. It was a very logical progression, both dramatically and thematically. And even though H.R.Giger was not an art design consultant for Aliens, Cameron already understood what Giger had set up in Alien and used it as a template to draw ideas from for the sequel for his creatures. He had his costume designers base their suits on the original. But Cameron himself was the designer of the queen. Yep! He drew a really creepy, but skillfully drawn, picture of her himself. The man is just oozing talent! I'm so glad he decided to have her constructed to be as terrifying and ""believable"" as possible. She was and is the Queen of All Monsters. ""Real"" monsters rule! It is really hard to believe that this movie was made for a mere 18 million dollars! Put that in your pipe and smoke it, George Lucas. This is definitely a ""must see"" for anyone who likes action, monsters, drama, war stories, and science fiction. You really can't get much better than this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The perfect horror-action blend,"While the original ""Alien"" certainly got under my skin more with its claustrophobic shots, I would say ""Aliens"" is at least equally entertaining. What I like most about James Cameron's action movies is that he never looks down on the genre. It's not because he makes action that the movie shouldn't feature well thought-out dialogues, a coherent story and actual characters, quite to the contrary: there's no point in doing awful things to your protagonists if we don't care about them in the first place. The first act is purely about getting to know the characters, that way it actually has some dramatic value when they inevitably get killed. The action itself looks amazing as well, it's incredible what you can do with practical effects if you don't have CGI to bail you out. The alien queen was so huge it needed fourteen crew members to make it move realistically, but the upside to that: it moves realistically, not pixel by pixel. I miss that charm in modern day action movies, but thankfully a movie like ""Aliens"" is infinitely rewatchable.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

However, the film does take a while to get going at the beginning but it works well because it is simply explaining the story. There is no need to watch Alien before this movie. I myself watch aliens long before alien and it was actually a great experience. Because then i could go back and watch the first Alien film wondering how Ripley got into the state she is. The night terrors and the manly build. This is typical James Cameron, you will notice this film is almost identical as The Terminator in many many ways. Notice 2 types of killing machines, an alien and artificial intelligence. Then you have 2 strong female characters, both of which go from the average woman to a soldier. The funny thing is, there is even a love story in both too, Sarah Connor with Reese in The Terminator and Ripley with Newt the little girl in this movie.This is an insanely brilliant movie with thrills and spills (and i do mean spills) which will keep you on the edge of your seat for the entire ride.I highly recommend this for viewing late at night in the dark.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

One of the best 5 sci-fi/action movies ever!,"This movie shows what is possible with a good director for a sci-fi movie. Under Cameron's direction this film creates an entirely unique feel from the first one (which comes off as more of a horror suspense film) while remaining creepy.  Aliens is one of the best action movies ever made, and there are several reasons for that.  The first is that it takes time to build up to any action at all, and by the time it does you actually have some feelings for the characters.  I think when the first action scene does come as an audience member you actually feel the desperation of the marines as they get ambushed by the aliens.  The audience actually hates the Paul Reiser character too, and more geniuenly then they do the usual bad guy.  He is slime and people love it when he finally gets what he deserves.  In my opinion most sci-fi films fail because the audience (especially a modern cynical audience) doesn't suspend their beliefs and won't accept spaceships and monsters etc.  But Aliens is one of those rare few that people accept. The characters are developed and human and the aliens themselves look real and believable.  The action is well paced and once it gets going it really moves.  I think this movie is really a blast the first time you see it, because you don't know who is gonna make it out, or what's gonna happen next (though I'm sure many suspected Weaver to survive).  I think the first movie set the stage for that unexpected element, but this one delievers a totally different and in my opinion better experience than the first.  If you like sci-fi or even just action movies this one isn't to be missed.  It's highly influential in both genres and ranks in the top 5 in both, or at least in my opinion.Zoopansick",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A perfect example of the perfect film.,"The action is pure adrenaline. Guns, explosions, crashes, shouting... Everything an action junkie could ask for and more!

Weaver, Biehn, Reiser, Henriksen, Pullman... Everybody gives 110% performances, so the audience cares about their fates. I really like the crush between Ripley and Hicks. There is an obvious attraction between them, but it's very hushed, almost childlike, making it much easier to relate to and, therefore, enjoyable. It adds nice bits of levity to the conflict without interfering with the story in any way.The film is spectacular on its own, but James Horner's score makes it outstanding! He, like Cameron, masterfully infuses horror and action elements together to make the audience's adrenaline pump double time.Aliens is, in my opinion, a perfect film.

Aliens is sci-fi/action at its best, including fantastic special effects, non-stop action, one of the most memorable character's on film (Bill Paxton/Hudson) and an incredible music score.

How does this have the same rating as the first?!?!?,"I would imagine this is the last ""watchable"" Alien movie to have came out in this franchise. That being said, this installment came out SEVEN YEARS after the first. Why? I have no clue. But you can tell they have moved from 1979 to the typical late 80's action films, making this movie, in my opinion, very forgettable. I guarantee if people had IMDB back in 1986 they would flame this one in comparison to the first. But to have the same rating!?! Is absolutely insane. The only reason this has such a high rating is because it is probably the last movie in the franchise that is deemed a ""classic"" while the next movie, again, doesnt come out for another 6-7 years. That doesnt give it the right to hold the same rating as the first.Now to get to the actual movie. It is WAY too long, the beginning starts off extremely slow and the movie build up of a pissed off main character finally gaining trust of her new ""comrades"" just to lose that trust again, then, everyone dying is just the same old song. They go back to the same exact location, blow up another multi million dollar thing, go on this big hunt towards the end for some random little girl that has nothing to do with story. The action is extremely sub par just like many 80s of the like released around this time. Too big of guns, lots of explosions, same stupid sounds, lack of good gore, douchy cast etc. My last gripe. The cast is extremely annoying, the little girls screams, the Marines are the typical hard asses as you would expect, and Bill Paxtons character is just as annoying as in every other film hes in.This movie takes too long to end.

Game over man!,"The best thing about the Alien franchise is that the producers used a different director for each film, it really allows the film it's own individual signature.

The characters are totally believable (even if Bill Paxton's Hudson is unbelievably annoying) and the mother daughter relationship between Ripley (Weaver) and Newt helps crank the tension of the final reel right up to 11. But the reason this IS one of the best sequels ever is because it gives us what a sequel should, the character we love in a new and interesting situation. Cameron's style also helps, along with cinematographer Adrian Biddle; they create a tense and gloomy blue-lit labyrinth full of danger.Even if it does loose points for the annoyingness of Hudson, and the fact that I don't think the director's cut is all that good (it adds too much making the film seem strained) this is a top notch action thriller and a noble sequel to Ridley Scott's classic.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Leave it to mr James Cameron to improve on perfection!!

Perfect Movie,"This movie is the perfect sequel. Takes everything from the first film and only improves on it. Great blend of suspense, action, drama, and mystery. The characters are well written, fleshed out, and really are memorable, unlike a lot of modern-day sci-fi films. The quality of the script is what makes this gem stand out - they focus a lot of building the relationships, the tension, and the mystery of the peril. This is what's missing in many of todays' films. They just want to get to the action. ""Aliens"" really takes its time to get to it, but its all worth it. Also, this movie has the most BADASS end sequence, that only Sigourney Weaver could've pulled off. Seriously, this is the best female role ever written. The blu-ray makes this film look good to today's standards. Go watch this film!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
You will be on the edge of your seat cheering for Ripley to succeed in rescuing Newt,"First of all, I gave this movie 10/10, 'cause it really deserves it. It is a masterpiece of both sci-fi and action, and it is a must-see for everyone.And once Newt (Carrie Henn, one of the cutest little actresses I've seen) steps in the picture, there will be no way for you to just sit back and relax. It is a very tense movie, and you will find yourself screaming at the bad guy (well, and aliens too) even though ""It is just a movie"".If you ask me, this is the last movie in Alien series.

"What can i say, It's THE MOVIE!!!","It's my favorite movie ever. Sure you can say there are better movies, in all types of technical matters, and story an all that, but for me it's the best because of the momentum of the first time i saw it (ten years ago i was 10 years old) and the feelings and images that were created in my mind, the sounds entered my ears and never got out! More than fifteen years have passed from the film release and the special effects are still enjoyable. The scene of the first encounter between the aliens and the marines it's simply astonishing, the rythm that the scenes, the music and the dialogs impose are breathtaking...

"""Get away from her you BITCH!""","One of the most intense and outrageously astounding films I have ever seen in my life all in a matter of Sci-fi, horror, action, drama, and the incredible bond between all the characters.  Cameron out-did himself by a long shot in making this movie. He really pulled it off in surpassing it's predecessor.The aliens were that much more awesome and everyone made an amazing performance.  Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Jennifer Goldstein, Carrie Henn, and the BAD-ASS Sigourney Weaver!  An incredible actress and one of the strongest heroines of all time.  A woman who can rip s*** like noone's business and still stay gentle at heart.  Her bond and relationship with Newt is beautiful and emotionally awesome.Cameron brought a whole new side to Ripley when he wrote in the character of Newt.  Even at the end of the movie when Newt reaches to Ripley she says ""Mommy!""  Ripley really loved her like her own child and would not let her go.  I fell even more in love with Weaver's performance afterward.Not to mention this movie is loaded with tons of classic lines that I still recite to myself because they're so clever!  ""Guess she don't like the corn bread either.""  ""It doesn't mean we're engaged or anything.""  ""I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.""  ""LET'S ROCK!!!"" ""And you, you little s*** head, you're staying here.""  ""This bulls*** that you think is so important, you can just kiss all that good-bye!""  ""I knew you'd come...""  ""C'MON GOD DAMMIT!!!""  ""Get away from her you BITCH!"" This line is definitely my most favorite of them all and always will be!As for the music, most inspiring and emotionally powerful.  Especially the song used at the end of the original theatrical trailer.  Awwww!!!  I can't help but give an evil smile and get goosebumps every time I hear that song! Even the opening theme kicked ass.So there you have it!  Aliens defines the best of the best in sci-fi and the Alien saga all-together.  Aliens will always remain my favorite no matter what anyone says.  And if you haven't seen this yet then you don't know what you're missing.  You will NOT be disappointed!  Even if you don't like sci-fi you'll have a blast.  It's a total blow-away!SHEER PERFECTION!!! 9/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Action packed and a great plot,"Aliens is my second favourite film so this is going to be a bit of a one sided review. It is by far the best in the Aliens series, with the best cast, direction and story line.What I love so much about this film is the characters. Ripley is much better in this than in the first, she is much stronger, yet at the same time, more vulnerable (especially in the special edition). In Alien, she is too weak, Alien 3, she over does the tough image, except for the beginning (I am yet to see resurrection). Then there's Hicks, possibly my second favourite hero ever second only to Kyle Reese. It is not simply because I am a Michael Biehn fan, but the way Hicks' character is illustrated. He is the only down to earth marine, and is the only marine caring for Ripley. He has to take on great responsibility from being a 'grunt' to leading the mission for a short spell. Hudson and Vasquez are two really fun, macho characters played by two actors who I like (especially Bill Paxton). They help to give the film a lot more character.Weaver is regarded as a good actress and this was the performance that really got the roles coming her way. Quite simply, she is brilliant in this film. The way Weaver handles Ripley's development as a character is very creditable and her scenes with 'Newt' (Carrie Henn) are very touching to watch. Michael Biehn plays a similar role to that of Kyle Reese in The Terminator. The main difference is that all the vulnerability and naivety Biehn showed in The Terminator is gone and has been replaced with great confidence. Bill Paxton as Hudson is a great piece of casting, especially beside Biehn as Hicks. The way the characters contrast is very effective and also allows for some more humorous moments which a film of this intensity needs.James Cameron is my favourite director. Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss and True Lies are all great films. He really gets the best out of his cast and uses resources to their full extent. His idea of only having five alien suits in this film and using them repeatedly works much better than any CGI favoured by today's film makers. When it comes to using special effects and models/suits, there is no one better. Aliens is a masterpiece of art expressed in film. Stan Winston, yet again, proves his worth in this film as Geiger's alien vision looks at its best in this film. It is a very sleek figure that is simple, yet complex in design.With some truly stunning action sequences to bulk up the entertainment of the film, Aliens really does have the full package and it can even be said, in my opinion, that the film is flawless. Aliens, like The Terminator, is one of the few films to gain so much respect outside the Sci-Fi genre and it is through Cameron's writing skills and the amazing acting from everyone involved. Hard not to like, Aliens will always live long in cinema history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Aliens...,"When we last saw Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) at the end of the 1979 classic ""Alien"", she was just putting herself into hyper-sleep after dispatching the creature out of the airlock of her lifeboat. This film picks up the story 57 years later when she is picked up by a salvage freighter, and she awakens to discover that she can't get rid of the nightmares that haunt her every night.After being blacklisted by ""The Company"", she finds herself struggling to get through the days as a power-lift operator, until she is asked to assist a squad of marines to do a search and rescue at new colony outpost on the very planet where all the trouble started - LV426. Hoping it will put a stop to the nightmares, Ripley reluctantly agrees.Packing enough fire power to level a mountain, the tough marines go in - and soon find themselves overwhelmed by the alien menace....This is one of the most thrilling science fiction films ever made, and writer/director Cameron has created a sequel that is self-contained and, in my opinion, far superior to the original. This was the first big-budget picture he made after 1984's ""The Terminator"", and Cameron explodes out here with a style and pace that is all his own.With great characters, innovative effects and some very memorable action sequences - this movie moves you along like a freight-train - and doesn't let you off till the very end.""How could they cut the power, man?

Aliens is one of the best movies I've ever seen!!!,"I was just 10 years old when Aliens came out in theaters, so of course my parents wouldn't let me see it because it was R-rated. However, I was able to watch it on TV a few months later (before my parents came home from work), and I have to say that without a doubt this is one of the best movies that I've ever seen! Even though it's a 20-year-old movie, I can still watch it again and again without growing tired of it; the music and the effects are top-notch, not to mention that the girl who plays Newt is so believable you almost forget she's acting! Now, if they'll only come out with the next installment in the series, I'll be totally happy... ;)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Great movie, horrible score","When I saw this film on the day of its release I was in 7th heaven. Every beat, every cut, every line delivery was nearly perfect. Except James Horner's horrible score.I kept hearing Gorki Park, The Wrath of Khan, Krull and dozens of his earlier works, sometimes repeated with little or no change.Granted the man had very little time to step in and write this score and little money. But this is a tragic case of a great film that could have been greater still.But James Cameron ! When will he return to fiction film? It is a tragedy that he never got ""The Crowded Room"" off the ground. He was supposed to direct the story of Billy Milligan, the man with 23 separate and distinct personalities. At the time of Aliens and Terminator 2 people thought of him as only a special effects director. Only! But one has only to look at the ensemble acting in this film or think of Sarah Connor's breakdown scenes in the asylum to know how much Cameron loves actors.Come on back James boy! We need you, if only to knock hacks like Michael Bay out of the arena.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Rambo in Space,"I saw Aliens first on the big screen when I was 14. I did like it, yet even as a kid I had a cynical heart. My first reaction after viewing the film was: Aliens is `Rambo in Space'. I also felt strongly that the climactic scene was no different to Alien.I've matured and mellowed somewhat over the past decade and a half and have grown to appreciate Aliens more and more. It is such a finely turned creation that mixes perfect amounts of action, horror, science fiction, feminism and (dare I say it), anti-capitalism.I viewed the extended 148 Aliens on DVD yesterday and I love the extra scenes. The shorter length cinema version by comparison is excellent, but in my opinion just a little too frenetically paced. I love the extra information about Ripley and the god-awful future society she's forced to exist in.It's very rare for a sequel to equal or better it's predecessor, yet Aliens easily equals the brilliant Alien. The central reason Aliens is so successful as a film is that it uses lashings of originality which carries on neatly from where the previous film ended. If only more directors and writers felt the need to create an original story when they're hired to create a sequel.There are so many strong and plausible barriers for the characters to work against during their adventure. And the characters themselves are all well drawn and quirky which creates great scene dynamics. There are so many times when I felt like slapping Bill Paxton across the face and shouting: Deal with the situation man!' Fortunately I didn't have to do this because Ripley put the bugger into line.Even though I've seen Aliens 15 times, I could watch it again tomorrow. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of my all-time favourites,"This film has to be the biggest action, visual & special effect, dramatic, sci-fi film ever! It is a big favourite of mine, simply because it exudes so much energy, passion and is better than any theme park roller coaster.James Cameron is a genius (and good ole' Canadian boy, eh?) by taking a fairly simple story of the sole survivor of the Nostromo in Ridley Scott's Alien and making her a mother figure for the sole survivor of the LV-426 colony. Mix in a great supporting crew of Marines and a mysterious android, awesome visual effects, a heart-thumping score and you have a perfect blockbuster classic.In case I haven't made myself clear, this film ROCKS (and I haven't even seen it on the big screen)!10/10 (was there any doubt?)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but not nearly as great as Alien or Alien 3","Aliens has been officially called one of the very few sequels to be deemed better than the original by critics. Sue me, but I liked the original Alien movie and Alien 3 a lot better.Don't get me wrong, I really liked Aliens, it's a good movie... but it somehow lacked the tense atmosphere and isolation of ALIEN and ALIEN 3. Aliens is The Terminator of the Alien franchise- directed by no one else but Terminator's own James Cameron - and it is definitely more action-oriented. That is not necessarily bad, and I can understand why some people might prefer this, I however didn't.Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) reprises her role with equal brilliance as in Alien, and there is no doubt, without her there wouldn't have been a Terminator 2's Sarah Connor and probably no Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Xena Warrior Princess. Ripley is a genuine action hero and a role model for female heroines.Apart from the stereotypical marines, performances are quite good, first and foremost Lance Henrickson and also Michael Biehn.The 1990 special edition (director's cut) offers more depth to the characters, but at a run time of almost 3 hours is a bit long, the theatrical version is paced just perfectly.The aliens are more numerous and serve as cannon fodder rather than posing a serious threat at times. Some of the prolonged action scenes in the DC are tedious and I can understand why they didn't make it into the theatrical cut. I prefer the isolation and near powerlessness of Alien and Alien 3 to the more action- and SFX- oriented Aliens.Aliens' outstanding visual and sound effects won Academy Awards. Unlike many other movies, these Oscars are well deserved. The aliens look outstanding and far better than some of today's CGI BS. Like Terminator 2, Aliens was a landmark for SFX.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Best action movie ever? Yes, it is.","I know I'm not alone in believing Aliens to be probably the best (sci-fi/) action movie ever made. It may not be artistic per se, but the entertainment value is through the roof. Off the scale. The story is good, the execution is intelligent, the actors and characters are charismatic, and everything about the structure and pacing of the tale is just impeccable. The aliens are successfully and convincingly used as a kind of extra-terrestrial predator more vicious, threatening and deadly than any we know from the real world.As for the first Alien movie; while it is a supreme work of art and a great achievement, I think the sequel is better. But they're very different movies; one is sophisticated horror, the other is an unashamed sci-fi romp. Alien The 8th Passenger is realistic to an extent perhaps unequaled in any other SF movies, and its spaceship setting is sublimely perfect. Aliens, however, is heroic and hardboiled yet sensitive space action in the manner that other sci-fi/action movies only dream of. All elements are balanced perfectly, and the viewer can engage their emotions in the action over and over. Aliens is the definitive action movie yet produced.10 out of 10, easily.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Vietnam in Space,"This has been discussed before, I'm sure, but Aliens is Cameron's war movie, albeit set in outer space. Why the Vietnam War? It's perfect because you have a group of Marines that are confident that they'll eradicate any foreign enemy due to massive amounts of firepower. But when they get to their destination, all hell breaks loose and they don't even have a plan nor any idea how to fight the enemy. Maybe it's an extreme take, but to me, my favorite movie of all time is truly an example of the Vietnam War in outer space.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

There might be lots of macho army guys in this movie but none are as good as Ripley. The plot in this movie works with a few twists and turns that original didn't have. You get great effects and CGI the same as the first movie. The best part about this movie is you get to see alot more of the 'alien' universe.

This movie is mostly plot-holes... mostly...,"After 57years, RIGHT as Ripley comes out of cryosleep, the colony is overrun by aliens... the chances of that is very, extremely, highly unlikely... the chances of those two events happening in the same week is basically impossible.Also, how after 57years of colonizing a planet, HAVEN'T they done a scan of the planet's surface yet to find the ship abandoned there?You're telling me that EVERYONE on the planet was dead, except for a little 8y/o girl? The chances of that is extremely unlikely, and besides that plot-hole, once they found out that everyone was dead, why did they continue on ahead? Their entire goal was to find the colonists, and once they found them, there was ZERO reason to continue exploring, so that's yet another plot-hole.Another plot-hole is the fact that they would ever leave the ramp to their jump-jet open... on a strange planet, that they know has aliens on it... why would they ever do that?Also, who knew aliens were capable of using and operating an elevator? I certainly didn't know that, but yeah, apparently they are able to press buttons and get into an elevator all by themselves! totally not another plot-hole right there...The characters also do some very idiotic things during the whole movie... honestly too many things to mention but trust me, they couldn't have written a stupider script wrt. the actions of the characters.Overall, the movie has an inexcusable amount of plot-holes, just like the first Alien movie had... this movie, without the plot-holes, is an 8/10 movie, but with them, it's just a 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Game over man""","The 80s were really the first era where video games began to influence the look and above all the experience of movies. This trend arguably began with Star Wars in 1977, although barring some flight sequences near the end the possible link is more about the Computer-generated imagery rather than a game-playing experience. But a decade later, just as virtual reality was starting to become a really exciting concept in both science fiction and modern technology, the idea of an action movie being a primarily first person experience was, well not born as such (the idea was hardly new), but certainly enjoyed a surge that made the 80s a golden age for the genre. Aliens features no CGI, just a fabulous mix of prosthetics, miniatures and animatronics, but it captures much of the pace and passion of the video game age.Director James Cameron puts a real emphasis on closeness, putting the camera right within the melee. When the marines tool up and jog off to the shuttle, the camera tracks along with them as it were one amongst them. Later we see a scene of chaos and carnage through video monitors from the soldiers' personal cameras. Throughout the picture there's continual movement, from which Cameron's remarkable ability to make not very much look exciting and suspenseful. It's all about careful control of the pace. After the marines touch down on the moon, there's a period of inexorable slowness during which Cameron is able to stave off the action scenes for a surprisingly long time, knowing the audience will be enjoying the suspense. And when the actions sequences come, they are no disappointment, a breakneck mix fear and exhilaration.James Cameron is a rarity among directors, especially in the field of action blockbusters, in that he writes most of the screenplays for his movies, unaided. As such there's always a very tight co-ordination between how characters come alive both visually and verbally. In the scene where everyone is revived for the mission, Cameron has a short amount of time to introduce a half-dozen or so marines. He gives each one a brief close-up and a line or two of memorable dialogue that nails down their personality, or perhaps some little mannerism like Apone putting a cigar in his mouth before he's even sat up. Any more would break the punchy flow of the movie, any less and it would be a bunch of grunts getting picked off with no connection to us. Despite his brevity, Cameron is very precise in his character introductions. Take for example the scene where we see Newt's family investigating the crash site (only in the special edition, I believe). Cameron employs a careful choice of angles and lighting to make sure that it is Newt's face that stands out more than the others, even though she is a passive character at this point.Cameron's dedication to his characters is matched by fine performances from the cast. Sigourney Weaver really runs the gamut, from her anger towards the company in the early scenes, through her steely determination before the enemy, to her maternal tenderness towards Newt. What is most impressive about her performance is that she is able to convince us throughout all these shifts in tone – her touching motherliness in no way diminishes our belief in her as a formidable heroine. The bunch of actors playing the marines give some distinctive performances. Given that the dialogue Cameron gives them is very sparse, they all have such narrow windows in which to make an impression. I'm especially impressed by Lance Henriksen, who gives a brilliant interpretation of the android character, mostly deadpan but with the occasional flicker of true emotion.And all this is important because Aliens is ultimately a very emotional movie. There are some really beautiful story arcs here – Ripley learning to trust an android, redeeming herself after being castigated by The Company and belittled by the marines, and finally regaining a daughter (this is one of the reasons why the special edition is really essential, because it establishes all these arcs properly). And this is really one way that Aliens is very much not like a typical video game, which is unlikely to include any such humanity and poignancy. Aliens stands as not just the perfect audience-involving action movie, but a powerful example of this pure storytelling medium.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Ripley is back with reinforcements,"James Cameron's wildly successful sequel to the brilliant shocker, Alien, is not to be discarded as most movie sequels tend to be.

Now this...this is an action movie.,"Aliens has my vote for best action movie of all time. It's such a great piece of filmmaking, starting with an almost subdued opening 45 minutes, then plunging us into an all-out rollercoaster ride of pure, kick-ass action and adrenaline. Movies today like the crap Jerry Bruckheimer spews out have made movie audiences forget what a real action film is. This isn't a cliched buddy cop pic or a yawn-inspiring spy movie....this is a testosterone-charged, relentless catapult into the best that sci-fi thrillers have to offer. James Cameron followed up the brilliant ""Terminator"" with this masterpiece, solidifying his claim as one of the stronger directors in Hollywood (yeah, I know he made Titanic, but we all make mistakes).

The Alien Is Great...

But, **** that. There is no excuse for these big budget sequels with 'writing teams' and cutting edge effects that fall so far short of expectations.If you waited years for this, stood in line for an hour, smoked great weed and saw the first showing in the theater, then you left happy. However, in 2019, I can watch Alien (1979) and watch this film the next week. Not 7 years of waiting, 7 days. So, I have clear memories of how great Alien (1979) is, and the contrast is striking.James Cameron had a vision. There needed to be a despicable bureaucrat (Paul Riser) and a complete moron (Bill Paxton) and Ripley really needed to have Empty Womb Syndrome, and there needed to be SOOOO MUCH TALKING!!! The constant dialog, often terrible, totally changes the tone from the first movie. Ridley Scott built tension through sounds, accompanied by great direction and non-verbal acting by Sigourney Weaver. I kept yelling, ""JUST SHUT UP!"" at the television during this film. The childcare aspect changes the pace of the film, as well.The final showdown with Big Mamma Alien is a great fight sequence, but it should have started 40 minutes earlier. This film had bad pacing, too many ideas, was too long, and is a huge letdown from Alien (1979).RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

Doesn't get any better than this,"This film has got to be my favourite of all time.

Sigourney Weaver's role in this film is much improved over Alien (in my humble opinion) and she becomes a true female hero at last - the toughest of the whole bunch. The special effects are truly amazing and would not look out of place in a film today. The Director's cut also adds new elements to the film - everyone who's seen it will know what I mean.

"simply, the best film of the history","i have seen ""aliens"" 6 times and what i can say is that is impossible to do a better film...simply impossible . i am sure that never will be done a better film . if somebody thinks this film is not good , he don't know what he is saying . this film has all somebody can wish to see in a non romantic film ;the tenssion never stop from the begining to the end ; sigourney weaver is the best actress of the history and a lot of things more;sigourney must have won the oscar in 1987, i really don't know who won it , but i don't need to know it ; i never have seen a better actress or actor in a film , and this is because is impossible ...maybe somebody can think i haven't seen much films , but i can say i have seen probably more than 7000 , and none of them was better,simply because what i said before ; it is impossible to do a better film than +""aliens"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My favorite film of all time.,"James Cameron truly understands how to make an incredible film. In Aliens the creatures are great, but it's really all about the characters. Every single character in the film is memorable and very quotable. I consider the best performance in the film to be Bill Paxton's character Hudson. He provides the perfect amount of comic relief when it's most necessary and he is probably the best part of the film. I originally watched this movie when I was six and from that point on I've had a love for film. Essentially, if you haven't seen this film, you need to see it. I've never been inspired by a film so much in my life. Aliens is by far the best horror-science fiction movie to ever hit the big screen, and I'll be surprised if anything ever surpasses it. I consider Aliens to be the closest thing to a perfect movie in film history. It's straight up awesome.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This time it's war...,"The terror continues as Ripley returns to Earth after drifting through space in hypersleep for 57 years. Although her story about the Alien encounter is met with skepticism, she agrees to accompany a team of high-tech marines back to LV-426...and this time it's war.This film starred: Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn & Bill Paxton.ALIENS was directed by James Cameron in 1986, seven years after the original Alien film directed by Ridley Scott. In my opinion it is much better than the first as I was not a massive fan of Alien at all, but ALIENS remains one of my favourite films ever made and every actor did their part to perfection especially Bill Paxton who is probably the best character in the film as you do get a few laughs because of his silliness and the way he reacts when they find out Burke stitched them up.I do recommend this film to everyone who has seen the first film even if you didn't like the first film, I didn't but this is a massive improvement.*****/***** Outstanding!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the best sequels in all of cinema,At the end of Alien Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) was found floating in a pod. Upon her rescue by Weyland Yutani(the corporation that screwed her and her fellow crew members in Alien) she is told that there is already a terraforming colony on LV214(the space jockey planet) but contact has been lost for some time. She involuntarily agrees to join the team to go have a look. What follows is a fight to death between a bunch of marines and the evil Xenomorphs. Aliens is different in style and tone to Alien and that's a great thing. One of the few sequels that work so well Aliens shows the importance of a visionary director of the caliber of Jim Cameron.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Kick A$$@!,"Alien was / is one of my all time favourite films.  The totally shocking and scary alien  a stealthy stalking killing machine  disposing the crew of Nostromo  it scared the bejesus out of me (it still does!).Aliens picks up 57 years (or so) after the first film.  Ripley can't get over her experience with the alien  she decides to join a team of marines, sent over to investigate the disappearance of colonists on LV-426.  Everyone is sceptical of Ripley and her story of the alien.Surprise surprise  the aliens have taken over the colonists and its up to Ripley and the surviving marines to escape from LV-426 and get rid of the aliens once and for all!  Hoorah!This film works on so many levels.  It is highly original  tweaking this film into a `Vietnam-style' war film is a brilliant masterstroke by James Cameron  but retaining the sense of dread and menace from the original filmThe characterisation is terrific  Ripley shows her softer, motherly side (not shown in the first)  but remains strong and determined  a great feminist character.  It shows her rising to the occasion once again  to face her demons one more time (alas the sequels!)The marines are excellent  with their tough / cool in battle attitude  from the dyke-ish Vasquesez (she is so cool) to the `fragile' Hudson (I love it how he is so distraught through the movie until he finally gets over it  and you know what happens to him)  ;-).Even Bourke is great (in a way)  he develops the issues raised in the first movie about who is worse (aliens or humans?).The special effects are awesome and it was great how the aliens have changed from the original film into more of a fighting machine than being a sleek, silent killer.Even though this film is `gold'  I still think the original beats it (only just) with its spooky atmosphere  I know heaps of people would argue with this!My score 10 out of 10 baby!  A word of advice  watch the original cut rather than the special editioneven though some of the extra scenes are kind of cool (the shooting gallery gun thingos)  I find that the film was better without you knowing what happened on LV-426.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Awesome!!,"Not only does this movie pack intensive heat and hot men in army uniforms, the aliens and effects are completely awesome and its as if they are real! This is Michael Biehns best performance in a movie and shows that he can give orders...I would take 'em!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the best sci-fi sequels ever,"Sigourney Weaver's Oscar-nod as Best Actress for this was so accurate; her depiction of external and internal pain was right on the mark, her facial expressions were always vibrant and emotional.  Oh, yeah.  The movie's excellent too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best female action hero shows the guys how to do it,"This is a rarity - a sequel that's better than the original.Sigourney Weaver shows all the male action hero's how it should be done by adding sensitivity and commitment to the role, the ingredients so sadly lacking in macho ""grunt"" movies like Rambo.There are so many great scenes, but especially the sequence where she goes back into the abandoned complex, with the countdown running, to rescue the little girl.  In the lift (alright then, elevator) she strikes a pose before setting out - awesome.And what a great understated performance from Michael Behn, surely one of the most underrated actors of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The creatures start taking on the role they deserve,"Somewhere in Space -2000++. The mining corporation forgot to declare the planet where aliens had been discovered as an 'off-limit' place, and colonists have been sent there. Now they launch a distress signal and a bunch of ultra-macho Marines (accompanied with the first expedition's sole survivor) is sent for rescue. The only survivor they find upon arrival is a little girl, and their objective quickly turns towards the extermination of the Aliens. Faster said than done Actually, this sequel of the first Alien is better done, faring less stupidities if not less improbabilities. The creatures are seen more clearly and their extraordinary design deserves it.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Different from Alien, but in no way is it bad","More of a sci-fi/action this time around, it's a squad of fully armed marines against a bunch of aliens. Also Ripley gets to kick some major ass. And it's just as awesome as it sounds! The marines all have different personalities and are quite memorable. Great special effects and numerous quotable lines, help to make this one of the best sci-fi/action movies, and also one of the best sequels ever made!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Perfection!,"This is one for the books. A movie will never be so perfect and well done as this one. Pure suspense, action and horror in it's finest form.... I have seen it so many times i can't remember and every time it makes me excited. The effects is BETTER than all the computer bulls**t nowadays and just feels more real. Stan Winston is probably unemployed these days and this is his best work ever. I'm of course thinking of The Queen. And James Camerons only third film happened to be the one he never ever could top, tough T2 is a really really great movie but seriously, a film that stars Schwarzenegger could never be taken THAT seriously.This is the Sci-fi/Action-movie that sets the standard for every other film in the genre...Rating 11/10! ;)PS. I for one wish that Hollywood wouldn't focus so much on fancy CGI and CGI-characters and bring back the real magic that once fulfilled our imaginations....",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Performance in the film and behind the scenes,"This is a wonderful film because it was directed well, had an excellent story and a brilliant cast.  Bill Paxton and Michael Biehn brought out their best for this movie.  It was full of action and it always has everyone on the edge of their seats.  This also is the best Alien film because Ripley is shown as a stronger and more caring character.  10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Michael Biehn and James Cameron together again,Another great collaboration for Michael Biehn and James Cameron following The Terminator with Aliens.  Arguably better that the original this sequel to Alien takes it a step further with great intensity and sci-fi horror that will thrill any viewer.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
