Practically Perfect Interpretation of a Less Than Perfect Book,"Just finished reading the book ""Divergent"" before the movie opened today. It was a quick easy read. There was obvious inspiration from various other futuristic young adult books I have read, like ""The Giver"", ""Ender's Game"" and the ""Hunger Games"" books. Like the others, the treatment of the story was cold, But its descriptions of the initiation rites were very much more violent.The setting is the walled city of Chicago after a great war. Their society is divided into five distinct Factions based on personality traits: Dauntless (brave), Amity (friendly), Candor (honest), Erudite (intelligent) and Abnegation (selfless).At the age of 16, a child takes an examination to help him choose which one will be his faction for the rest of his life. He may follow the suggestion of the exam results, or he may decide on his own. Those who fail to be accepted into a faction becomes factionless, as they become hopelessly poor and destitute for life.Our heroine Beatrice Prior has been born to the Abnegation faction with their grey clothes and disdain for any form of vanity. However, her examination results are revealed to be inconclusive, so she has to make her own decision. Meanwhile, an uprising is brewing in Erudite against the government run by Abnegation.I had some problem with the book and the way they try to make the Factions distinct from each other, when it is easy to see that overlapping does happen. These traits simply cannot be mutually exclusive from each other. It is also disturbing the way the author describes the Dauntless. Does being brave mean jumping off running trains, having piercings and tattoos, beating each other up mercilessly, or even killing yourself? This may give immature readers the wrong ideas about courage.o - o - o -The film was a perfectly conceived interpretation of the book. In the first few scenes where they show the color-coded clothes distinguishing each faction was quite clear. How director Neil Burger showed us most of the memorable scenes in the book, like the choosing ceremony, the jumping on and off the trains, the fear landscapes of Tris and Four, and the invasion of Abnegation were all very well done.There were some parts which were reinterpreted in the film. Most did not really affect the story-telling, like changing how Tris meets her Mom during Visiting Day, or glossing over a particularly violent episode where Peter stabs a fellow initiate in the eye. There was one big change towards the end about how a climactic surprise rescue transpired. I thought the version in the book was so much more better set-up and executed than the less-dramatic altered version we saw on screen.As I suspected, the tall and beautiful Shailene Woodley is definitely not the small and mousy Tris we imagine while reading the book. However, I thought Shailene gave an excellent portrayal of Tris' character, how she developed from a shy dependent girl to a confident fearless warrior. For people who have not read the books, they will not be aware of any discrepancy at all.Theo James had very good romantic chemistry with Shailene, so his Four never really felt like a threat to Tris, unlike the initial parts in the book. The director gave James a lot of lingering close-ups for the benefit of the teenage fan girls.Ansel Elgort, who played Tommy Ross in ""Carrie"" recently, now plays Tris' brother Caleb. His Caleb is less dynamic than I imagined him in the book. Coincidentally, Elgort has an upcoming movie with Shailene Woodley later this year called ""The Fault in Our Stars"" where they play boyfriend-girlfriend.More up and coming actors play other more minor characters. Zoe Kravitz, who was in ""After Earth"" last year, is not exactly how I envisioned Tris' best friend, but she won me over as the film went along. Miles Teller, who was recently in ""That Awkward Moment"", plays bad boy Peter, whose role in the film is much diminished compared to the book. Jai Courtney, who played Bruce Willis' son in ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" last year, brutally plays Tris' tormentor in the training camp.Among the senior stars, Ashley Judd makes a nice comeback of sorts playing Tris' mother, who had major secrets of her own. Maggie Q played Tris' examiner and tattoo artist Tori with the requisite compassion. Kate Winslet plays the cool and calculating Erudite uprising leader Jeanine with icy perfection.Overall, I thought this film was a practically perfect interpretation of a book that was less than perfect in itself. So, whatever things the film might show us which we might not like, like the slow pace of action progression, and the questionable motives of the characters, are actually because the book told it that way. Fans of the ""Divergent"" books will find this film version faithful. While it cannot compare to the high standard set by the Hunger Games film series in terms of cinematic quality and character casting, ""Divergent"" definitely has its own entertaining appeal going for it. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""Don't Try And Define Me.""","I have to say that the producers would have to be stupid not to use Burger again as the director. He did such a great job with this one. I thought I was going to see a film that was mostly aimed at teens. However the story alone makes this far superior to most teen oriented films. In fact this didn't feel much like a teen film at all. The fantasy story is a great metaphor for our current society, it's simply a very relevant film. The directing here was spot on. The story as fun as it is, does have a few holes, sure, but they are easy to look over because they are such small holes. The film simply works as a commentary piece on political philosophy, and as an entertaining action film laced with some romantic tension. In my view this film was far, far superior to the very teen oriented and very one dimensional Hunger Games, and it's certainly more unique as well. Woodley is impressive here, clearly showing the ability to play a very layered and complex character.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Watchable if odd and slightly confusing for newbies. For fans, it's a good adaptation of a problematic novel - so good that it suffers from many of the book's flaws.","When beloved books make their way to the silver screen, the resulting movies are usually met with much frustration and rending of clothes from amongst the literary faithful. A character is changed beyond recognition; a crucial plot-point excised; an important theme lost in the murk and swell of a film. Oddly, Divergent isn't actually a bad adaptation. In fact, Neil Burger's film is as good a version of Veronica Roth's wildly patchy source novel as you're likely to get. Whether that makes for a good movie - especially for people who've never read the book - is another matter entirely.Divergent begins in a post-apocalyptic Chicago divided into five factions, each valuing one virtue - Dauntless (courage), Erudite (wisdom), Candour (honesty), Amity (kindness), and Abnegation (self-sacrifice) - above all others. It's an odd system, perhaps, but one that is apparently necessary to keep chaos at bay. Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) has been raised in Abnegation but, try as she might, she cannot completely subsume her self or her desires. Indeed, the aptitude test that everyone must take at the age of sixteen suggests that Tris doesn't belong in just one category: she is Divergent, equally at home in three factions.Come the day of the Choosing Ceremony, she decides to forsake her family to become Dauntless: a decision that plunges her into a nightmare initiation process in which the weakest are summarily kicked out of the faction. As Tris navigates the politics and perils of her chosen world, trying all the while to hide the fact that she's Divergent, she encounters her fair share of allies - Christina (Zoe Kravitz), Will (Ben Lloyd-Hughes) and possibly her charmingly broody instructor Four (Theo James) - and enemies, including the brutal Eric (Jai Courtney) and vicious Peter (Miles Teller).Anyone unfamiliar with Roth's book might find themselves trying to puzzle through this seemingly shapeless mess of a plot. It ebbs and flows in odd directions, dancing around Tris' desire to be true to herself, before it gets a little lost in the dystopian clutches of Jeanine Matthews (a gleefully icy, evil Kate Winslet), an Erudite leader hellbent on bringing down the entire Abnegation faction. Along the way, Tris literally battles her fears under the influence of a simulation serum, toughens up physically, strikes up a sexy chemistry with Four and frets over her brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort). Within the confines of this universe, it makes an odd kind of narrative sense, but the logic of it all never really bleeds through.Here's the thing, though: this strange, frequently illogical plotting is very much a defining characteristic of Roth's novel - and, in fact, becomes more of a problem as the trilogy progresses. (Anyone who's read Allegiant, the controversial final novel in the series, will know just how difficult it will be to adapt.) The emotional and logical flaws present in Divergent the film, then, are - for the most part - already inherent in the book. Why does Jeanine, supposedly one of the smartest people in the community, plot and plan the way she does? How does the entire society function in this utterly dysfunctional way? Technically, Burger can't really be faulted for failing to develop a coherence and logic that was never there in the first place.In fact, Burger actually substantially improves upon the novel in several ways - he keeps the film mostly free of Tris' inner voice, which becomes increasingly moony and silly as her crush on Four grows by the day. Burger plays up a zip-line sequence that highlights the joyful recklessness of the Dauntless, as Tris soars freely through the midnight air. He also handles the problem of Tris' fear landscape very well: instead of simply willing herself out of the influence of the serum (as the Divergent can do), she must figure out how to face each of her fears in a non-Divergent way. These scenes are shot with quick, simple visual flair, dispensing with some of the novel's trickier convolutions.Of course, Divergent isn't a perfect adaptation either. To Roth's credit, there are some truly dark, painful moments in the novel which transcend its loopy narrative. It's no surprise, and yet it's a little disappointing, that these bits simply vanish from the film, no doubt in the interests of securing a PG-13 rating. As a result, Peter is a far less repulsive antagonist than he is on paper. For instance, he doesn't brutally (and casually) maul a fellow initiate who's doing better than him in the rankings - an incident that's crucial in the development of his character in the subsequent novels.The young cast works hard and quite well together. Woodley makes for an intriguing screen presence, effectively playing both the steel and softness of Tris' choices. James, heretofore best known for dying in Lady Mary's bed in Downton Abbey, acquits himself reasonably well - he's not as leaden as some of the trailers have suggested, and he forges a believable chemistry with Woodley. Of the supporting players, Teller is the standout, so good in his easy malevolence that he actually makes the thought of Allegiant as a movie quite appealing.In the final analysis, Divergent is likely to divide audiences. Fans of Roth's books should be, on the whole, pleased. This is a frequently very good, intelligent adaptation of a rather problematic novel. Everyone else, however, might be less enamoured of the final product: a film that, just like the book on which it is based, boasts a compelling story and some great ideas, but is also messily executed, overly complicated and a tad nonsensical.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Some people are just different...,"""Divergent"" is the first Sci-Fi movie of this trilogy and in this movie we watch a world that is divided into factions and each person has to be a part of one. Unfortunately Tris cannot be a part to any of these factions because she is a divergent. Divergents are considered as the most important and dangerous people and have to be eliminated but why?I liked this movie because it has a different kind of plot from other Sci-Fi movies and that's something that made this movie interesting at first. The direction which made by Neil Burger was very good with many good action scenes. Also the interpretation of Shailene Woodley who played as Tris was very good. An equally good interpretation made by Theo James who played as Four.Finally I have to admit that I did not expect much from ""Divergent"" but it was a very nice surprise. This movie made a very good start for this trilogy and I hope to continue like this and even better.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Stands out against other similar minded movies.,"Settling in to this film, I expected to see Hunger Games again. Set in a near-future Chicago, what we see is another take on the dystopian society. The central plot here is that growing up in this walled in world, everyone must fit into one of five classes. But of course, the question here is what if you don't fit into the nicely packaged definition of a single class, then you must be Divergent, or in this movie, a danger to the perfect society. When our main character, Tris (played very well by Shailene Woodley)finds out she is Divergent she must hide this secret and discover the reasons why it is such a secret and why society fears Divergents. I'll leave all of that for you to watch unfold in the various physical and psychological training exercises that are portrayed on screen. In a nutshell, the world painted is similar to that of Equilibrium but with much less action. This is not a bad thing, since this allows the cinematographer to reveal a very wonderfully crafted view of this world. The pacing of this movie moves along nicely as we plod through Tris trying to fit in as a part of the Dauntless clan. Friendships are made, lost, and so on as expected. Even more so is the romantic involvement with the mysterious Four (or 4) played by Theo James (which I believe over acted his part entirely too much). So the mystery of why the government wants to kill all Divergents must be unraveled and this leads to the majority of the story. I was happy with just sitting back and enjoying the view during many of the scenes that were almost breathtaking. Not reading the book, I hope that the movie did well to portray the story but I also know it is a trilogy so they couldn't go from start to finish all at once. Stand alone I believe the movie was quite well made and under-appreciated, swept under the rug by the highly successful Hunger Games series. You will be hard pressed not to see the similarities between them. I am looking forward to seeing what else this world has in store for us and would recommend that moviegoers join me to find out. Will you see silly acted parts, and scenes that are just there to draw you in with nice landscapes and perfectly choreographed music, YES. But why would anyone complain about something like that? I know I wouldn't. Enjoy this film, you won't regret the time you spent on it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Refreshing.,My review is not based on reading the book but solely on the movie alone. I found the movie very similar to The Hunger Games in the sense that it divides people into groups and focuses on the teenagers. But this movie was 100x better! It had me on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. This movie is inspiring and motivational. It is the type of movie that shows that accepting people for the flaws and their strengths is important and that everyone is different in their own way and that it's okay to be who you are. I think more kids need to see these types of movies and I would recommend it to anyone. P.S. Do not watch this movie before or after The Fault In Our Stars cause it may make things a bit weird haha.,10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
From a viewer who went to this simply to accompany his girlfriend...,"Divergent is gripping and intelligently brought to life on the big screen from the director who brought us ""Limitless"" and ""The Illusionist."" Are we seeing something of similar essence with the ""Hunger Games"" series? Yes. However, my personal take was that the characters were more engaging and the plot was as well in this film. Shailene is excellent at the helm, and really brings forth a convincing portrayal of a heroine battling in a world where chaos and tragedy envelope the characters. Her graceful emergence from shy personality to dominance is done artfully and really speaks to her ability as an actress. Theo James is also exceptional in the co-pilot role and almost effortlessly seems to pull off the bad boy with standards persona in a manner I haven't seen since Will Smith in his prime. The plot is high octane and especially more gritty than I first imagined. The emotion raw in intensity and empathic build. As a guy who was just going to this film to act as arm candy and a shoulder to lean on for my highly enthused girlfriend, I can write this piece while honestly saying that my eyes were glued to the screen the entirety of the film and was pleased to see this film do such an excellent job at developing both the plot and characters involved in it. Highly Recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
DIVERGENT may have just saved young adult adaptations in Hollywood.,"DIVERGENT delivers where so many of the recent young adult novel film adaptations have failed. I saw this film not having read the book and on its own it stands very well.First off the bad:1) action sequences feel slow and not natural. You can tell that the actors were not particularly familiar with hand to hand combat, not to say their characters weren't supposed to be but even when they're supposed to know how to fight it feels lackluster. 2) obvious age difference between the two main characters. 3) high school Clich feel for the first half of the film.Now with that said ^ here is what Worked:1) length. Often we see film adaptations of novels try and cram everything into 90 or 100 mins but Divergent takes its time. Normally this would be a drawback but the film makes good use of the extra time (the film is 145 mins) to really progress. 2) the performances of the main characters are solid. Nothing amazing but the dynamic between the two main characters works well. - the visual style of the film is very good. The dystopian city of Chicago is very well realized. 3) brings to light moral and societal problems. Suprizingly deep for a young adult film.OVERALL divergent is a good film. It fails in few places but succeeds in most that count. With the failure of young adult movies such as Percy Jackson, Divergent healthily separates itself from them. I would recommend seeing it. There WILL be a sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Best tween film in ages,"I'm glad I got around to watching this, I'm not sure who's writing the negative reviews or what they were expecting but I can honestly say that this is the best tween film I've seen in a long time.It IS a tween film, it's blatantly aimed at young girls and as a ""twenty-something"" youngish female, I'm not embarrassed to say that I really enjoyed this film. It's pure fantasy fodder of course but here's what I liked about it:the relationship between the two leads develops naturally i.e. they don't see each other and go 'you're my soulmate', in fact they don't really get on at first so this is believable and refreshingthe lead actress (Shailene Woodley) playing Tris is extremely natural and one of a very few actors I've ever seen who has convinced me that they are grieving (usually grief in films is just 'oh, they're dead, I'm so upset' ... swiftly moves on with their day..) - Actually both of the leads (Theo James as well) play their roles really wellI loved the point of view shots like when Tris looks at Four during the training and you see it from his perspective and then the camera cuts to his face to get his reaction to the look she gives him (there are other similar scenes) and it just adds to the effect of feeling like these are real people and I empathised with them more as a resultYeah the background story for the city is quite thin but who cares, stranger things have happened in the real world and what I like is that we're given a sense of 'this is what they've been told but is that what's really happened?'. I'm not sure if that's in the book or if the film makers wanted to add some realism for us grown-ups but when they question what's out there, I got the feeling this might be similar to The Island (2005) - that's not a spoiler it's just my opinion and probably totally off baseI have now watched this film about 4 or 5 times because I really liked so much of it: the fighting was believable for me because I think we've all gotten used to flashy choreography and sound effects but that's not what real fights look like or how they sound so for me, these fight scenes are really good. I liked the weapons because they kept it simple and for training, they're a good idea.Probably the thing I liked the most is the fact that ""it's not all about Tris"". I mean, it IS all about Tris but it's not 'totally in your face, the world revolves around Tris and no-one else matters' all about Tris... What I mean is that there are some ""films"" out there which spend their entire running time having the supporting actors running around warning the lead actress not to have sex with her boyfriend lest he destroy her vagina but in this film, the lead actress often shares centre stage with her new best friend, there are a lot of scenes where she is in the background looking out as opposed to a lot of shots of her standing alone / in the centre and we see her friend fighting too; the focus is just not 'always' on her. Having said that, I do think that there could have been even 'more' focus on the people around her. First of all, had we gotten to know her friends better, we might have empathised with them more (trying not to include spoilers!) and also, this will sound harsh but it needs saying, I'm sick of seeing 'ethnic' people in minor or reduced roles: what a waste of Mekhi Phifer! I wish that Zoë Kravitz had been given more to do, yes she had a decent amount of screen time but I would have liked to maybe see her 'fearscape' and... that's about it for ethnic characters I think... yep.I liked that Jai Courtney's character didn't go overboard as the villain but again, his character was a little one dimensional and I would have liked to have seen some more interaction and dialogue between him and Four just to flesh out their background story.Kate Winslet honestly did the best she could with her part and it's a massive credit to her that she managed to make me severely dislike her and believe that she was evil with just a few odd lines here and there. Her role is to literally just pop into the film every now and then to be a bit menacing and give off a female-Hitler vibe (bright blonde hair). But she pulls it off in my opinion. There's no point in elaborating on why someone is pure evil, we know this exists, it's happened in the real world and it's still happening so her role didn't distract from the believability of the story.Overall, I liked the subtlety of the story. There is no sex, no profanity, no overt 'I love yous' yet it didn't come across as 'after-school-specially' at all. Also, I never groaned out loud once or cringed or had to hide my face behind a pillow while someone professed their undying love for someone they just met a week ago. The dialogue was realistic with occasional over-rehearsed acting from some of the supporting cast but I really loved this film. Go into it knowing it's a tween film and that there won't be a lot of intelligent scientific explanations for things and you'll probably enjoy it as much as I did.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Divergent was Spectacular as a Stand Alone Movie!,"As a stand alone movie, Divergent was great. The cinematography was decent, but the storyline alone was marvelous. The action keeps you on the edge of your seat. The romance was well... romantic. It may have been a little too sappy and forced to me, but still cute. All in all, the movie was a perfect blend of comedy, mystery, action, drama, and romance. Thus, a new fan base was created.The only problems with this movie were the acting was a bit shaky at some points and it diverged from the books a lot too (see what I did there). The characters were well developed in the movie as well as the book, but some details about the characters were left out from the movie that were in the book. The settings and storyline did the same thing as well.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
mediocre,"I went to see this movie misled by the high rating on IMDb. Unfortunately it looks like Hollywood makes movies for people with short memory. I admit I haven't read the source book, but I guess I wouldn't, judging by what came out of it. I hereby venture myself in saying that the book is also a bad SciFi novel. It has way to obvious imports from well known themes that have been exploited to the brim by today (like the ""perfect"" society that sacrifices diversity for peace, the ""different"" guy that stands-up to the system, the genuine technology that controls individuals (poorly described, by the way), the fear confrontation ad the list could go on and on. It is not essentially bad to bring these themes in a movie, but I see nothing new, original here. So... if you have seen Equilibrum and the Hunger Games then you know it all. Movies today are just mobile phones... keep reproducing ""features"" from the competition, while it is supposed to be an art. Another thing can't stand in movies in general is the poor IT incursions. I am talking about the scene in which Jeanine is asked to turn off the ""control system"" which consists of a huge touch screen in which she just hits some ""cancel"" button. That was really pathetic... Anyone could have done that right? Another thing that I can't stand, is the cheap psychology things in these movies. They are all based on some sort of psychoanalysis which is long time deprecated in therapy. But it is somehow considered to be ""cool"" and ""trendy"" by producers to insert these kind of flavour into the movies to make it more profound. Or are they just as stupid and ignorants as the target viewers? Anyhow... to me, this is bad taste in art. If you want to really go for it, you must do way better that that and if you can't, then at least make it more interesting. It is also true that movies like ""Inception"" don't occur every month, but once they do... they set a trend and everybody will just take a byte of it. Don't get me wrong, it is a ""watchable"" movie, perhaps a little too long for its story, which, by the way, is very predictable and full of clichés. I read some users claiming it resembles ""The Hunger Games"" and so it is, especially with the modest ending that awkwardly announces a sequel. I could predict how the story developed and ended after the first 15 minutes and that's what makes this movie mediocre. Script is mediocre, but at least it does not abounds in stereotypes so it's bearable. What can be said about acting... there is no acting in this kind of movies, you only need to be young and good looking, be able to learn your part and you're done. It's not that the actors are bad, but the movie itself is not based on any acting mastery and just because of that, the girl gets a plus for making something out of it. I am curious if the ratings will stay as high as now in time.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Exceed Expectations,"I watched the movie without having read any of the series, and yet, it is apparent that the movie did the books justice. I absolutely like how there is less romance and more substance this movie has compared to other similarly themed movies. The casting crew did a great job by choosing the lead actor and actress. The depth of the characters development is proper. Thus, this movie is also entertaining for adults. I sense good chemistry among the casts. The lead actress successfully portrays a confused yet brave teenager and captures innocence, while the lead actor renders a mature vibe that help save the movie from being categorized as another superficial teenage love story.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not Excellent, but Great!","When first hearing of this film and seeing the first trailer, I didn't know what to think about it. It didn't excitement me much and all the way up to it's release, I didn't feel it had that same kind of vibe that 'The Hunger Games' had. A vibe that it was a must see film. Then I heard a sample track from the score, composed by Junkie XL. It was great, and it made me want to see the movie a little bit. Well that and I wanted to see if it was actually a great film, like The Hunger Games was. Plus I do like the main star, Shailene Woodley. Well, I just saw it today and here is what I think. The music is great, it has one of those themes that I can't get out of my head and a score I've been listening to since I left the theater. The film itself was a very interesting film, very different from what I understood from the trailer, but I'm not familiar with the story so that is probably the main reason. I really liked the futuristic, post-apocalyptic, dystopian feel that it had going on through it, but it also was kind of scary to think that human life could become that one day. The plot was easy enough to follow, but sometimes confusing. Though, if I had read the book, I'm sure I would understand it 100%. The elements I had trouble remembering were the names of all the factions that people were divided in, or chose to be in, and what those factions' meanings were. When they would show the symbols for each faction, it made sense to me, but the names itself I couldn't quite grasp. I'm sure a second viewing will clear that up, defiantly if that second viewing is on blu-ray and with the captions on. Anyway, other than that, It kept me quite intrigued in a pleasantly unexpected way and I really look forward to next year for the sequel, Insurgent, and the year after that for the concluding film, Allegiant.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not quite the quality of The Hunger Games, but still have its own persona and unique setting...","Not quite the quality of The Hunger Games, but still have its own persona and unique setting. The story takes time to find its feet, and while the action sequences was great, the vast number of characters kind of put things in the mix for this decent young adult novel adaptation.The world felt a bit weird and extreme at first, and it takes time before we can finally believe and be immersed in the world. Meanwhile, story-wise was great in the bigger picture, but the first half of the film was all about Dauntless and so it flows in a very narrow scope. Afterwards, the bigger picture is revealed, when we finally realize the significance of ""Divergent"" characters, and the scale of the conflict. That's when the story kind of takes a hard turn and get going for a full blast finale.The vast number of characters makes it hard to follow most of the supporting characters, making things a little confusing, all the while making us less caring for them. Yet, this also means that we can kind of like the main protagonists. With all the different kind of characters, those we want to hate, those we don't care for, leaving us with the main protagonists to like and root for. This is perhaps the reason why we can care for them emotionally, despite the less emotional nature of the unfolding plot. The first half of the film has no drama for us to feel, while in the second, there was too much of drama where we end up getting lost emotionally (in the end, all I care about is the two main protagonists).The visuals were great, and so were the action sequences, supported by a decent soundtrack with some very likable themes as well. The villain of the film was interesting on its own & fresh for a new franchise like this, and the acting by Kate Winslet was also brilliant, but to be frank, they will need a more threatening & challenging villain if they are to up the stakes for the sequels (truthfully, it is well decided in the novels already, but given that I don't read them, I cross my fingers that the next villain will prove more challenging). The twist towards the end is interesting, and quite a nice touch as well. Meanwhile, the ending felt much too abrupt and unfinished, and it just begs of a sequel to come fast.VERDICT:Good: Great visuals & action, Decent soundtrack, Unique setting, Vast array of characters (mixed)Bad: Takes time to find its feet, Abrupt endingSCORE: 7.0(blockbusted9.blogspot.com)",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Movie Review: Divergent,"I suppose this will be as much a book review as it is a movie review. I went with a group of friends and saw Divergent yesterday morning. The Pg-13 film was 139 minutes long. I will start my review by saying it was over in the blink of an eye and left me wanting so much more.Prior to the release, critics blasted the film. It received an average 3.5 out of a possible 10 Stars on I.M.D.B. This made me apprehensive. Critics also kept comparing Veronica Roth and her novels to Suzanne Collins and The Hunger Games. Scathing reviews said that Divergent was nowhere near as equally riveting as The Hunger Games.The stories are nothing alike. The only similarities I saw come from a strong female teen lead character. Is Katniss anything like Beatrice (Tris)? I suppose, but she is also completely different; motivated by a unique set of circumstances. No. I change my mind. Other than both being female, and teens, and the main characters of their own trilogies -- there are no other similarities. (Do not get me wrong. I enjoyed The Hunger Game books, and so far, the movies. I am just missing the point as to why the two sets of books/movies are being compared. There isn't one. And they shouldn't be).Personally, if you have not read the book Divergent and see the movie, I suspect the movie will be complicated. Not un-followable, just complicated. The plot is not simplistic despite being geared toward teens. I do know several people who have since seen the movie without having read the book and enjoyed the film just the same. Anyway . . .Set in a futuristic Chicago, a community is enclosed behind an electrified fence. The community is split into 5 Factions to keep things running smoothly. The intelligent faction is known as the Erudite; the honest, Candor. The peaceful people are known as Amity, and the brave, Dauntless. The selfless faction, the one Beatrice belongs to, is Abnegation. One is born and raised in the faction of their parents. On your sixteenth birthday, teens undergo a test to see which faction they actual belong in. Regardless, a person can pick to be in any of the other four factions, or stay in the faction they were raised in.When a teen chooses to leave the faction they were raised in, it is upsetting. They must say goodbye to their family. There is a good chance they will never see them again. And if you fail in your knew chosen faction, you can not return home. You become what is actually the 6th faction. The Factionless -- those who don't belong to any faction, and live like the homeless, scavenging for food, and clothing, and shelter. . .Beatrice's test results are inconclusive. They do not point to any one faction. Instead, they point to them all. She is what the government calls, Divergent. This is dangerous. Divergent do not think like anyone else, and therefore are a threat. Forced to keep the test results a secret, Beatrice must pick where she feels she best belongs.Abnegation has always been in charge of the local government because they are selfless and can therefore be trusted with politics. Beatrice discovers a plot by the Amity to overthrow the Abnegation. Chemical injections given to Dauntless will leave their minds susceptible to suggestion, making them dangerous and unstoppable --since the Dauntless train to be warriors, the police of the nation, the protectors of all.The movie is constantly compelling. The time flies. Beatrice (Tris) is played by Shailene Woodley. Never heard of her before. She nailed the role of Tris. (She reminded me of a young Tatum O'Neal. The way she talked. Something about her eyes, too. (The Fault in Our Stars will be released later this year, starring Woodley, as well). With forthcoming releases of Insurgent and Allegiant, she will surely be a star to watch.Theo James portrays Four. He also someone I have never heard of prior. At first, he was not what I pictured when reading the novel. Seemed a little too old. However, as the movie progressed, I think I saw what casting directors picked up on during auditions. He was Four. No way around it.While directed by Neil Burger, written by Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor, Roth did not give up her creative input. She also helped write, and co-produce the film. Good for her. Although some story elements from the novel are missing, overall the movie stayed mostly true and on point.Compelling and action-packed, great acting, and some intense scenes (yeah, I jumped once or twice), I found Divergent so entertaining. I cannot wait for the next in this bound to be popular trilogy.Phillip Tomasso Author of The Vaccination Trilogy www.philliptomasso.com",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Transported to the world of Tris and Four,"With the exception of using Shallene Woodley as Tris, it was very close to the book. I thought Tris should have been shorter, kind of like the actress Rooney Mara and with blonde hair. The special effects were fantastic, but I expected them to be. Kate Winslet was a wicked Jeanine. I was wondering where the movie was going to stop and was pleased with the stopping point. I would have enjoyed the movie even if I had not read the book.The movie actually shows you more of the city that the story takes place in then the first book alluded to. I highly recommend this movie. It is a good one to see if you enjoyed The Hunger Games series. Plus having a woman displayed as strong, brave, bold, yet definitely has a tender side was well played by Woodley. I saw her in Descendants and she has a long career in the movies. Kudos to the producers, directors and all that participated in the making of the movie for this selection.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Better then us refs expected,"Divergent is a film adaptation of the novel, written by veronica Roth, that takes place in dystopian Chicago. The society that resides there is split into five groups or ""factions"", each representing different virtues: Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless, Erudite. On a certain day each year, all youth that are 16 years old take test that determined which faction is the best fit. In the end, no matter what the result, one is free to choose whatever faction they wish to. However, if that faction is different from the one they were raised in, they must leave their families and everything else behind and fully commit to their new role in society.Tris (Shailene Woodley) is one of these 16 year olds to be divided. On testing day she shows equal aptitude for three separate factions, making her ""Divergent"". Confused, Tris is told to keep her results a secret and ends up choosing the Dauntless faction. As Tris deals with the grueling challenges of becoming Dauntless, she discovers that being divergent entails much more than she ever imagined.I think fans of the book will be very pleased with the adaptation. I have not read the books so I made sure to bring a friend, who had, to the screening with me. According to her, the film does a great job at making the book an emotional and entertaining movie without sacrificing major plot points that would otherwise leave fans disappointed. The Tris and Four (Theo James) are well cast. There's nothing particularly outstanding but they are enjoyable to watch. According to my well-read friend, their romance was whittled down significantly for the film, which I think worked out for the better. I really enjoyed how their relationship developed. And while it is a major part, it didn't overshadow the story as a whole.I was really impressed with the music. Being a dance music fan, I think the soundtrack is fun. But the musical score, composed by Junkie XL, is what stood out to me most. There are a handful of very emotional scenes and the music really drives it home.I am a little outside the target age range for this movie but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. The obstacles that Tris encounters will translate to audiences of all ages. It's a great story with multiple scenes that led me to reflect on not only my own adolescence but also on my journey as an adult. Out of all young-adult-dystopian novels that have been made into movies, this one is definitely my fave.http://redcarpetrefs.com/2014/03/divergent-review/",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Imaginative, but misguided dystopian adaptation","If you see this because of Shailene Woodley, you have chosen the wrong film. She's a better actor than this. You have to give her credit for stepping outside of her comfort zone, but she's not Jennifer Lawrence here. I believe she has the acting chops to get there, but this film might have been attempting too soon for her.The movie tries to do a lot. Too much. An adaption of a huge dystopian world, a social commentary on class structures, a coming-of-age ""I'm different than most people but that's OK""-type story, and a boot-camp movie. There are some moments that are done very confidently and others that are not. The confident moments are the feel-good little victories, the action set pieces are excellent, the combat, the special FX, dystopian Chicago is very cool, and some of the acting is very good. Although I will say, the casting is better than the acting. The writing and acting are probably the least confident elements to this filmAs with many sci-fi and fantasy movies, the directors often focus on the cool or epic before performance and character. Or there's just too many things to think about and too little time to shoot that you have no choice. Either way, these characters were not as deep as they could have been. But you want them to be and that's what was frustrating.Divergent also suffers from the classic case of adapting but forgetting the essence of the book. It wasn't quite sure what it was, where it lies, who it is, why it exists. It feels like a producer's movie - let's buy the rights to a book, throw some up-and-coming stars on-board, and market it like the Hunger Games sorta, but not fully. But in the producer's book, it was a minor success, as it is making money. So success there.At any rate, I love this genre and I love original stories and adaptations. I wanted this to be good, but it just doesn't go there. I'm glad it's doing OK because that means more original-ish content will continue to be made.And to Shailene Woodley, props for trying something new. But for now, stick to the Fault in Our Stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Mediocre at best.,"When reading the book, I had concerns about how well it would translate to film. It's a book without much action and most of the narrative is internalized to the protagonist. Books like that tend to struggle to adapt well and Divergent is no different. The director tried to make changes to the story in order to try and make it work but I honestly think it was futile. It's just not a good story for a 2-hour interpretation. Even at that, I would rather have seen the story stay true and struggle to adapt than change and struggle. All in all, it was set up to fail from the beginning. Shailene Woodley and Theo James gave solid performances and the special effects and action sequences were done well but they made the film watchable and slightly enjoyable at best.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Predictable, poor","I went to the movie without watching a trailer or reading about it so i had no expectations . from the begging the story was kind of so predictable. you could see where is it going. even though the movie had plenty of action, romance and drama. there were missing parts like they didn't tell us what happened to the rest of the world after the war that we don't know any details about. the society was so dystopian. he idea of dividing people into 5 frictions, at a certain age they test them to find where they belong even though they could choose something different. and friction before blood ! and those who didn't fit anywhere have to live their rest of their lives homeless useless. The writing was poor, inconsistent and very basic it could not compete with other action superhero's movies released in the last couple of years.I gave a 6 because i find the directing and the cast were good, they made the movie stand out. I found Theo one of the best parts in the movie.. I mean lets be honest, they had to choose a good looking actor and make his this perfect to attract audience.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good enough adaptation of the book,"Now here's the thing: I've read the book, which means I started the movie knowing what to expect. So the cheesy plot, the seemingly nonexistent background, everything was already inherent to Divergent in my mind. To me, it was simply part of the concept that the movie would develop, so I didn't find it so horrible. In fact, I even thought it was a good adaptation of the book, but then that could have been because I read it over a year (or maybe even a couple of years) ago. I can't say it was objectively good, though.The romance was awful, there seemed to be no chemistry between the characters in question, they definitely would have been better off as friends. Time seemed to be off too. I mean, I knew quite some time was supposed to have passed between (SPOILER)the choosing ceremony and the final confrontation(/SPOILER), but the director didn't seem to be able to convey the passage of time properly, so hadn't I read the book, I think I'd probably have a sense of timelessness and would see it all as a bunch of things that happened somewhere at some point with some unknown amount of time separating them.Not only weren't characters really unique or remarkable, but also the film lacked emotion and thrill. Most scenes that could have been intense seemed to be left unexplored in detriment of more fight scenes and, seeing as I'm not really a fan of action (or romance, for that matter), I didn't care much about all that violence.Despite all that, I did enjoy myself while watching it. I don't know why. Maybe seeing images I'd only had in my mind be put into something real and concrete made it special to me, maybe I already knew how bad it could be, so whatever good thing came of it was surprising enough... In the end, I'd say this is a movie for you to watch when you don't have much to do and you just want to relax.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Divergent is A Divergent which also means Most Viewers Will Like It & Majority of Professional Critics Will Fear and Bash It,"I won't compare Shailene with JLaw, who I like. Basically, Shailene has presence, her acting authentic, she delivers what this role called for, and that's that. I want to address the audience's favorable response versus the ridiculous professional critic scoring.Of course the film is not perfect, in a way Gravity or Hunger Games are not perfect. But why should it be? Of course it has flaws, like, the typology of the factions - where is the Artist/Creatives? Without imaginative power we will all die of boredom or fascism. Also, Intellectuals/Scientists and Straight-talking Factual sort tend to flock together, too similar to be separate factions. The parent characters under-used, the girl feels a little over-coddled...etc.Still, no big narrative crimes, nothing deserving a hysterical fail rating. Those who never read the book, who have enough open-mindedness, with hope only to be engaged and entertained, will likely enjoy the ride. The premise was interesting enough, the direction and styling effective, the movie's story world construction well-executed, the story-telling and pacing engaging, the acting performance by the two leads and Winslet and Maggie Q well-balanced, believable and non-jarring, the resolution was convincing enough...So what's up with the 40%/ 4 stars hysteria among the pro critics? I have my theories...In general movies get anywhere between 1:1, 1:2, or 2:1 audience love it VS critic love it ratio. This one got 2:1. Which means, the film not only hit the right note with a progressive crowd, it also diverged greatly from an unspoken dogma. 40% pro critic here and elsewhere, wow, obviously Divergent hit a sensitive nerve with the film industry's Erudite equivalent. It seems, Divergent the movie is itself a divergent in its own context, a potentially uncontrollable menace to a rigid, retentive, non-divergent, evidently HOMOGENEOUS English language film critic culture...But in this case, I'd go by the Audience's score. For starters, a 1000000X larger sampling size is always more objective than a few hundred homogeneous Erudites.My rule is, movies with 1:1 audience:critic ratio, the rating is most objective. 1:2, the truth is somewhere in between. But if it's 2:1, the critics are upset about some game-changing ""threats"", and the truth leans strongly toward the audience. Works for me anyway... I call this the AUCRIT Ratio. Feel free to test it yourself.Onto Divergent...I've never read the book. I do keep my expectations on neutral when watching a mainstream big-concept film - especially yet another adapted post-apocalyptic science fiction targeting young adults.Those who expect futuristic science fictions to have primarily male leading characters esp in power positions, invincible biological strength, brute force solution, outcomes determined by technology especially Very Cool Weapons, non-stop magical actions, hot sexy androids and fetish costumes will be disappointed.Those who *demand* award-winning plot and ""logical"" science in futuristic fiction movies are just being hysterical, for they tend not to notice the fantastical magic, bad physics and overkill tech in their ""serious classic"" science fictions - from star trek, star wars, 2010, batman to iron man are equally full of gaping logical holes, mostly with no award-winning plot-craft.Truth is, ""hard"" science is evolving constantly, and science fiction flicks are not made to be 100% accurate or to win awards (if so Blade Runner still wins today), but to explore possibilities in highly-compressed scenarios, to inspire, to enlighten, and foremost, to entertain.In today's myopic, easily self-satisfied world which classifies and judges people by preconceived notions about ethnicity, gender, profession, appearance, merits, we are constantly divided by rigid specialization, subjective education qualification rules, redundant scientific dogmas, simplistic morality yardsticks, always under pressure to choose factions: With-Us-Or-Them, for or anti welfare/ abortion, JLaw-vs-Hathaway, Pepsi or Coke, the in-betweens be damned.Identity by Tribe (and inevitably the side-effect of xenophobia and authoritarianism) is a timely topic, how The Power That Be and their obedient citizenry react to the exceptional, multi-talented, multifaceted generalists who dare to defy categorization.And this is no Twilight. More Hunger Games meet Enders Game. Definitely gender-neutral in appeal, at least among under 30's. Not everything with strong female lead written by female authors equates Hunger Games or Twilight or Harry Porter. Some ancient mindsets need to get used to the brave new world with the other half of the human population, women, being visible half of the time.The lead actors also defy categorization in their own way. Here's yet another hot young male lead who has brain and brawn and talent and emotional depth all rolled into one person...yet another intelligent and talented and cute young female lead who doesn't over-groom herself nor perpetually pout nor seem like she's out to please everyone or martyr herself. Does the world need more unaffected chicks and unassuming hunks? Of course, there's never enough of those on screen.Divergent may not be The Matrix or Inception grade, but why should it be. I was definitely engaged and entertained. Good enough for me.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not original nor excellent, but still good","I heard for the first time about the DIVERGENT franchise in 2019 but never been interested in seeing them because here on IMDB they have mixed reviews and look like copied from the MAZE RUNNER franchise. But last September I finally saw it because of most of the cast members and while I didn't loved it, I still liked it and found it worth the wait before watching.The movie is set in a dystopian future in Chicago where society is divided in five factions: Abnegation, Dauntless, Amity, Candor and Erudite. The rest, the so-called Factionless have no status or privilege. Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) was born in Abnegation and her father Andrew (Tony Goldwyn) serves on the ruling council: Beatrice's test results prove that she is a Divergent, and since Divergents can think independently they are seen as a threat for the social order. So Beatrice joins forces with a group of other Divergents that are in exile and try their best for stopping Jeanine Matthews' (Kate Winslet) conspiracy. She won't succedd but since they made sequels, you can guess what we'll see.The first thing I noticed when the film began was that the sets were so futuristic and unique... not your typical city of the future, that's for sure! There were various stunts that looked a bit like those of the MISSION IMPOSSIBLEs and were cool. The acting was decent, nothing exceptional. Woodley is a very competent lead, same goes for Goldwyn as her dad and for Winslet as the villain, and the others (such as Miles Teller and Jai Courtney) are on par with them. The soundtrack wasn't forgettable but still not that important.Overall, an ok movie that somehow achieved a cult following. I wouldn't put it in that category but more in the category of decent entertainment and nothing more.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A boring, sanitized version with no chemistry between the leads","I read the trilogy (which was nothing special and kept getting more annoying each sequel), but at least the first book had some kind of * something * to it. The movie sucks. It is boring and there is very little action (and what little there was is over too fast and not very thrilling). The violence is sanitized with the only real blood being when Four nicks Tris's ear with a knife toss. The two most horrifying scenes in the book are not even included: the attempted rape of Tris by Peter's gang and the transfer girl who jumps from the train and misses the Dauntless rooftop to splat on the street below. Tris doesn't have a ""save the cat"" moment early on and provides no real reason to ever like her.The story takes too long to get going, then the training goes on forever, only to have the ending feel rushed. Not once did I feel anyone's life was in danger. Not once did I perceive any credible romantic chemistry between Tris and Four. Not once did I laugh, cry, or feel anything but bored. And it goes on for two and a half hours! Ugh. Sure, the production values are high, but who cares if I can't relate to any of the characters or the story? It's just a dumb waste of time. I didn't hate it (only because I scored a free ticket), but have no desire to watch the sequels.However, I'm glad Divergent made a bunch of money opening weekend to pave the way for other YA books to be adapted into films, but they need to do a better job. The reason all the recent YA adaptations tanked at the box office is because they sucked (Vampire Academy, Beautiful Creatures, City of Bones). The only decent one I can remember was Warm Bodies.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Only the Haters wrote reviews -- see this movie, it's good","For some reason the rating is 7.7 with 1000s of data points, but the written reviews trash the movie -- ignore them, the numerical score is accurate. I read the books and saw the movie and thought both were very good -- not incredible, but good, deserving of 8 out of 10. One the key complaints is the same one you always hear when a movie is adapted to a book: how could they have not included scene/event/character x,y or z from the book? So and so does this in the book, but in the movie they do y. And so on. Give me a break. Does this really need to be repeated? You can't really convert a book perfectly into a 2 hour movie. You just can't. Characters get cut, shortcuts are made to the plot. Live with it or don't see the movie. Getting to the movie itself now. Yes, there are flaws and some logical missteps. But overall, the world that is created is visually appealing and interesting, the character (especially Woodley) do a good job, and the last portion, while a bit rushed perhaps, is engaging. I would say that the source material itself is not 10 out of 10 material, and the movie conforms to my rating -- very good, but not a 9 or a 10. If you can get over the book/movie thing, you will enjoy this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I don't buy this world,"In future Chicago, the inhabitants have fenced off the city and split society into five factions. Abnegation is selfless and put in charge of the government.

Those who don't belong are forced to live as Factionless. Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) lives as an Abnegation with her family.

There is a dark scheme underway by Erudite leader Jeanine (Kate Winslet).The phrase that keeps coming to my mind is ""I don't buy this world.""

A surprisingly good YA sci-fi action drama thriller adaptation,"After the tremendous success of Twilight, Harry Potter and Hunger Games series, Hollywood film studios have made several attempts to repeat the success. But, many have failed to capture the hearts of fans and general audience alike. Now, here comes another young adult sci-fi action drama thriller series...The Divergent Trilogy. Will it succeed and remembered as one of the good young adult series? Time will tell.Adapted from Veronica Roth's first book, it is a story about the conflict between individuality and social conformity...the dilemma of being different, not fitting in with the society and the fears that comes with it. It raises the question on why people in general, submit to social conformity (obedience and unwillingness to change), without any resistance. Is it really deeply rooted in our genes? Why individualists are mostly frown upon by society and feared by the authorities?The film offers an interesting world with strong characters, an engaging plot enough to captivate the audience for its long running time (140 minutes). In a post-apocalyptic Chicago, the people are divided into a five-faction social system, enforced by the authorities to maintain peace and order after an unspecified catastrophic war, based on their primary distinct personalities: Abnegation (selfless), Amity (kindness), Candor (honesty), Erudite (intelligence) and Dauntless (courage). The film starts out with the lead female character questions her place in society, but later on, she starts to question the fundamentals of the society itself.Much of the film's running time is dedicated to develop the characters enough for the audience to know them, by showing what they're going through and what they've become by the end of the film. The lead actors, Theo James and Shailene Woodley, delivered a solid performance in their respective roles and have a convincing on-screen chemistry between them. Kate Winslet, despite her short screen time (only about 20 minutes), manage to solidify her presence throughout the film, hinting that we'll be seeing her more in the next two films. Moreover, the ideas and concepts behind the psychology aptitude tests to determine which faction the characters belong or join are commendable as well, as they show the inner fears of the characters and why they possess the personalities mentioned in the film.However, some parts of the film feels rushed, especially the third art of the film, due to its heavy world-building, plot and character development in the first and second act. The fans of the books might complain about the missing parts, but from a person who haven't read the books (me), it seems fine and acceptable to me. I believe the film gets the essence of its source material right, despite the complex nature of its source material.Regardless of what the critics or fans said, the worlds and characters of Divergent and the Hunger Games are very different. Each stands on its own and shouldn't be compared with one another. The film has a good start. By the end of the film, I'm interested to see how things will be unfolded in the next sequel, Insurgent, which is releasing next year and how the story concludes in Allegiant, which will be released a year after Insurgent.Rating: 8/10""Individualism promotes personal freedom and achievement. Individualist culture awards social status to personal accomplishments such as important discoveries, innovations or great artistic achievements. Unfortunately, this threatens to those in power, the survival of a population of conformists that specifically adhere to well-defined rules and principles. So, the ones who are capable of thinking differently than others are usually rejected or deemed as outcasts in society. This creates a constant, endless struggle between individuality and conformity throughout the history of mankind.""",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Entertaining,"Divergent is an entertaining movie to sit and enjoy, that's for damn sure, it was actually better than what my expectations preceded. Shailene Woodley shines in her staring role as Beatrice, and Theo James is so perfect for his co staring role as Four. My absolute favorite actor here though is hands down Kate Winslet, she is so focused, determined, and unapologetically devoted to her maniacal plot, and it's obvious that she gave it her all the entire way through. The costume design is wonderfully constructed, especially for the Elite characters like Winslet. And the set direction is awesome to look at, very well put together. The action sequences are pretty standard PG-13 action movie material, not meaning that in a bad way, just saying you know what you're getting when it comes to that specific issue. The plot is very intriguing and it will for sure keep you interested and wanting more. Ashley Judd is great to see on screen here as well, a very noble addition to the well rounded cast, she is caring, adventurous and warm hearted in her motherly role to Beatrice. I really loved the dialogue back and forth between the characters too, very intelligent and witty. I cannot wait to sit and watch Insurgent, and then Allegiant, crossing my fingers in hopes they will prove themselves worthy, like this first installment did.

An enjoyable franchise beginning that Woodley carries admirably.,"Big budget adaptations of popular young adult novels have become the latest trend in Hollywood, with each major studio hoping to create the next Twilight or Hunger Games phenomenon. While many of these quick cash-in attempts have resulted in embarrassingly low box office returns, Summit Entertainment's Divergent, based on the bestselling novel by Veronica Roth, could very well be the proverbial ""next big thing.""In the future, society has been divided into five factions, each with a defining personality trait and a specific social role to fulfill. At the age of sixteen, each member submits to an aptitude test designed to guide them into choosing a permanent faction, but Tris (Shailene Woodley) is shocked to learn that she is ""divergent,"" showing equal aptitude for more than one faction. Not only is Divergence rare, but many consider it to be a dangerous condition that could threaten the delicate societal balance, and Divergents are routinely met with ""accidents"" that leave them in a body bag.In order to distance herself from her family members and keep them from discovering her secret, Tris elects to join the Dauntless faction, an elite group of warriors tasked with defending the city. But Dauntless training is more than she bargained for, with a hostile fellow recruit (Miles Teller) garnering an obscene amount of pleasure from pummeling her in the combat ring while faction leader Eric (Jai Courtney) nods his approval. She finds comfort and solace in Four (Theo James), who seems to understand much more about her than she chooses to reveal, and who might be her only hope for salvation.Divergent spends a hefty amount of time building its world and establishing its characters, and despite stilted dialogue that finds itself in dire need of a punch-up, the relationships still feel genuine and relatable. Woodley and James have palpable chemistry, while Teller and Courtney play their villainous roles with gleeful abandon. Kate Winslet also has an enjoyable turn as a sinister government official whose interactions with Woodley are chill-inducing - expect her to play a major role in the eventual sequel.Divergent is at its best when the action finally gets rolling, which admittedly takes awhile due to the colossal amount of exposition required. Woodley never quite looks comfortable throwing punches and wielding weaponry, but her talent and charisma do a nice job of balancing the scales, and she carries the film admirably. By the time the credits roll, audiences should be entranced by Tris and eager to follow her along to the next step of her adventure.-- Brent Hankins, www.nerdrep.com",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Amazing and Unforgettable,"This movie was astounding. Even though it may not be exactly like the book, the characters, acting, storyline, etc, WERE ON POINT! The actors did a great job as especially the main characters Four (Theo James) and Tris (Shaliene Woodley) did so good at expressing the actual romance from the book that people actually wanted them to be together in real life. This movie also has a lot of action, and also was suspenseful as sometimes I wouldn't expect people attacking Tris at one point and etc, etc. I don't know why so many people are hating on this movie when it was so compacted with all the emotions from betrayal, to sadness, to anger, to happiness, to romance.

Good Start for a Franchise,"Even though this movie wasn't as good as I thought it would be. It was a good start for the franchise. One of the best things about the movie was Shailene Woodley performance, she was excellent as Tris, and you could feel her every emotion in her face but mainly in her big beautiful eyes. And although it wasn't as very well showcased in the beginning, you could see it flowing out of her in the final third act. Moreover, the story felt kind of bland at times and as if it never reached its high point, which sincerely kind of came in the end multiple times, which led the ending to miss great opportunities to end ambiguously exciting. Therefore, it had an interesting premise, that can eventually become more interesting as the movies progress, but meanwhile this movie covered what probably any other franchise would've done in one. This never felt as good as Twilight or even The Hunger Games, and it might need to work more with its characters, because I found it hard to relate to any of them, but it isn't that far behind of any of the previous movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Four,"Four is the name of an important character in the movie. Apparently, it stands for poor writing, poor directing, poor casting, and poor acting.Let's start with the poor writing. Obviously this movie would be more enjoyable if one had read the book. Well, I hadn't, and therefore I was confused because the back-up story was non-existent. The movie takes place in an dystopian society. However, nobody tells what really happened to the world. Without adding any spoilers, it is hard to specify why the quality of the writing is constantly so poor, but let's just say that the story is so full of holes it looks like an emmental cheese.Poor directing. Good directing could have compensated for the ludicrous writing, but in Divergent they seem to form an unholy alliance. The scenes lack credibility - especially the action ones. Because of this, Divergent is a movie for the children at best.There are three characters that look somewhat the same. It took constant effort to keep on track on who is who. The absurd changing of the scenes didn't help. However, the biggest mistake of the casting crew was hiring Shailene Woodley. Sure, it is cool to see a relatively new face in a big budget movie, but there is a reason why it is so rare - they cannot act.The previous statement takes me to the final part, which rendered this movie close to unwatchable. The actors consist of young and inexperienced actors mostly. Because of the cheesy writing and directing, their acting seems even more horrible than it already is. Again, without including any spoilers, I won't go any deeper, but just watch the so-called ""chemistry"" between Tris and Four... Makes you feel awkward, huh?Finally, I want to clarify that I usually like dystopian films. In this case, I was expecting a rating of 7 or 8, so I'm still quite shocked because the movie fell below my expectations so badly. It just makes me so disappointed that this kind of budget goes to absolute waste because of these flaws I mentioned above. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you are a big fan of the books!",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Decent, for what its worth... ignore the haters.","I think this franchise would be better served by being treated to a full budget HBO production 10-13 episode run. The world the books create is highly detailed, gritty, and chock full of emotional depth and events that are just not possible to represent well in a 2-3 hour film.That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the film for what it did offer. The mental pictures I developed through reading the books were eerily similar to the ones in the movie. I tend to favor a movie's art style and atmosphere over acting/character development so I may be biased here. The post-apoc world was tastefully done, and didn't go overboard with blue glowing screens and lighting. The overall color tone is well balanced and natural, something that cannot be said for a lot of films that tend to feature over-saturated skies and light sources.Acting seemed solid to me. I tend to miss certain cues from the book, so if a character was acting differently than in the book, I probably didn't notice. The movie won't shock you or make you cry, but it did make me feel exhilarated at certain points. It was nice to not have unnecessary sex scenes for once. I'm not against sex in film at all, don't get me wrong. I just think the romance was done tastefully done.Overall, a solid release. (no pun intended)",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Better than the book!,"Let me explain. I watched this movie somewhat grudgingly. A YA novel adaptation set in a dystopian future with a highly structured society that the protagonist somehow does not fit into. She does her best to survive and meets a handsome guy in the process. Sounds like a plot that's been done and overdone in countless books targeted at teens. And it is. There are clichés throughout the movie but I still loved it.I'm not saying you are going to be completely blown away by the originality of the plot. I'm just saying that this formula works, as proved by the book's success, and the movie executes it well with a stellar cast and beautiful effects.Beatrice/Tris feels realistic and her reactions in the situations presented to her are believable. Four fills the role of mysterious male lead perfectly with aptly timed tidbits about his thoughts or past. For me, this was not well done in the book and I will be sticking to the movies only.Overall, a good movie for anyone as long as you don't mind being able to guess some parts before they happen.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

During the selection ceremony, Tris finally chose Dauntless. It turns out that only 10 people will be elected as official Dauntless members. Because of abstinence and intelligence, Tris managed to become a member of Dauntless.
But chaos occurs when Erudite controls Dauntless's brain to attack Abnegation. Tris who is not affected by serum pretends like the others. At that time, Tris knew that For was also a Divergent.

And a thrilling and rousing musixal score by Junkie XL. The flick was well directed by Neil Burger, though it results to be overlong and a little bit tiring. However, Neil did not make the second outing, as he couldn't due to scheduling conflicts with postproduction in this Divergent 2014. Burger is a good professional director who has got some successes as cinema as TV. As he has directed notorious films as The illusionist, Limitless, Interview with an assassin, The upside. And TV series and episodes as Billion, Books, the jury TV, The asset TV, among others. Rating : 6, decent Science Fiction movie that will appeal to teenagers.

Blew my expectations out of the water,"Seeing as how most adaptations of teen novels are rather horrible, I tried to keep my expectations low. I just knew that it wouldn't be as good as Hunger Games... Boy was I wrong!From the beginning till the end I was hooked. I found the pacing just fine. The people who complain about it being too slow are just folks who want every movie to be action all the time. The movie has plenty of action, but it also has humor, romance, drama, philosophy, and just general dystopian ingredients.The actors were phenomenal, the music --- well, I for one am getting the sound track, the story is very relevant to our surveillance society, and the pacing of the story and editing was just perfect.Along with Hunger Games, this has to be the best teen dystopian story on screen.

young adult movie that doesn't 'diverge' from the genre norm,"Quickie Review:With the popular demand for young adult novel adaptations, comes yet another movie called Divergent. Tris (Shailene Woodley) learns that she is a Divergent, a threat to a post-apocalyptic society as she doesn't fit in its system. Now she must try to survive the witch-hunt for all Divergents. This movie is as generic as it gets for this genre: love interest, protagonist is special but that's not a good thing, training montages, and so on. The only redeeming quality of this movie is Woodley's character Tris. Beyond that there is not much else you will care about.Full Review:In a post-apocalyptic world, a society has been sustained in the ruins of Chicago. In this city the population is divided into five factions, where every citizen must fit into so they can fill a role of the society. The main protagonist Tris (Shailene Woodley), finds herself to be a Divergent, someone who doesn't fit in any faction and therefore a threat to the system. Tris along with her mentor, Four (Theo James), must now find a way to put an end to a plot to hunt down every Divergent.Divergent is directed by Neil Burger, who has previously made The Illusionist, and Limitless, both movies which I quite enjoyed for doing something different. However, this movie fades into the noise of the young adult genre and does very little to differentiate itself from the generic clichés. As a result, this movie feels very lackluster and uninspired. The world created is intriguing at first, how the society is divided into factions to avoid conflict and war. Ironically this interesting idea also works against the whole movie, because all the characters are so cookie cutter and are exactly the same as everyone else in their faction. This may be intentionally done, but it leaves the audience with little care for anyone who is in peril on screen. The only characters that have any complexity is Tris and Four. So that's where I'll give some credit to the movie, the two central characters. Shailene Woodley is a great young actress in all the movies I've seen her in, and she is the best part of Divergent. She grows as a character and conveys her struggle between fitting in and being herself convincingly. Theo James, although not an incredible actor was at least layered and likable.Movies are an experience, and my experience watching this movie showed several red flags in Divergent beyond the ones I already mentioned. There were moments in the movie that were meant to be taken seriously but come off so melodramatic and awkward that I, including the rest of the audience in the cinema burst into laughter at its unintentional ridiculousness. Also the movie spent too much time on the training aspect of the movie, to the point I partially forgot what the conflict of the movie was. It only got to the real meat of the plot at the last 30mins of a 2hr 20min movie! There is one line that is uttered about the world outside of the fenced off city of Chicago. At the end of the movie, some of my friends and I agreed that we found that one line to be more interesting than the rest of the movie. That is not what a movie is supposed to make the audience feelAll in all, this is not a movie that is a must see. Perhaps the fans of the novel it's based on will enjoy this movie more than I did. Still I would not recommend spending your money to watch it in the cinema. If anything just wait for the DVD/Blu-ray release. It's a watchable movie because of Woodley's performance, and I appreciate the effort but I can't say I enjoyed it.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Perfect Storm,"This is perfect storm of bad movie making: a stupid story, bad acting and bad directing. Who is ultimately to blame? Money grubbing CEO's. Who else?Thanks to the mega-success of the Hunger Games and Harry Potter, Hollywood's scouring young adult books, like some pedophile in a playground, looking for new material to get their greasy hands on.Divergent is one of those series. I've not read the books, but in the movie, you belong to one of 5 factions. Our heroine does not - she's divergent - and that apparently frightens the powers that be.Why? Because individualism is seen as a threat. In much the way independent film makers are perceived a threat in Hollywood.What follows is one inane, dumb, idiotic scene after another. I was rolling my eyes most of the time or laughing out loud at some of the nonsense I was watching. I almost got up to leave, but it was like watching a train wreck.

30+ male and i really liked it - heres why,"I ignored this movie at first since it was released close to hunger games, looked the same, and had the least good movie trailer. but that trailer did it no justice.this is a movie for those with some imagination. likes dis-utopian worlds or maybe apocalyptic worlds. some said the story is unbelievable. how can everyone be a work drones except one woman? well I'll tel you, this is exaggerated but it still reminds me of old social / communism ideal world. everyone has its place and does what he is told for joint harmony. this reminds me of my parents always doing what is needed what they are told and expecting me to do something just because everyone else do it. and like in communism everything is good and peaceful and right. except the leaders which can do what they want to shape it. oh and kill those who pose a threat to them. yep communism.but no there's a new generation. just like my gen. the Y generation, that stopped doing what we are told, and instead started to ask ""Y"" questions - so did this one girl. there are others like her but she had the best instinctive to make a change (you'll see). all the charterers have a relevant background to how they act because of who they were. now they choose to do things different because of who they really are now. and that is what makes the shift. this could have happened a few years before or in another 100 years. when doesn't matter, only they who and why do.so whats wrong with it? 1. well it is a bit cheesy at times. they romantic part is predictable, simple yet believable in the movie world. 2. somewhat predictable. the story doesn't hide the main characters and the big issue, this is not a spy/cops thriller. there is no big twist. you enjoy following the characters and chain of events and how the characters react to it.I think this movie does everything hunger games did not: 1. its shorter. no need to wast your money and times. 2. the world is much more believable. not relevant but this is still our world. not a fully crazy imaginary one. our world just something happened. only this city matters. maybe there are others, maybe there are not. some said that hey don't understand how a poor civilization built this city but the civ isn't poor at all. its spends its wealth where it needs. some parts look bad, some look good.so final words, this is movie is a fun ride all along. those who didn't enjoy it are either too oldish (45+) to understand the idea (those who said this is a teen movie should realize under 40 isn't' teen, they are just too old for it). or maybe too dense to see beyond the basic simple story to see the message. this is our world. serfs and lords. kids and parents. workers and business men. those who do as they are told, those who try to control the lesser ones and those who try to find the in between. do what you want because you believe it to be right. if you are one of those, you will enjoy this great and fun movie.

I guess that is because the book was created for kids so the movie in that regard is a success.Now for the bad. From an adult perspective I thought this was a horrible film. The setting, plot, and character all scream ""Hunger Games rip-off"". I've seen many movies that are similar in certain ways, but this was just a blatant attempt to piggy back the success of another franchise. Even the movie poster mimic's the Hunger Game's aesthetics.

We don't understand why there should be factions and this looked a lot like Hunger Games. The blood thingy, where they choose the faction where they are going to be, another familiar scene... like in Harry Potter The Dauntless faction... they say they are not rebels and such... and this ""Dauntless faction"" reminds us of the Fire Nation in the Last Airbender.I mean, it is easy to get tired of these kinds of movies because they are very common now.And, Tris and Four?? Why the hell did we kissed? I mean, they just kissed and the romance went on... I mean, how did it happened so fast? There seemed to have no development between them through the course of the movie. Four is like this bully-turned-mentor guy who helped Tris throughout her stay in the Dauntless faction. And that's just it, I think I would like to see them as just mentor-student as for now. They should've skipped the ""love story"" for the next installment.I liked the whole concept really, but I think it is just redundant.

Excellent Movie Version of the Book,"To start off this review let me clarify that I have read the books, and read them not long before seeing the movie, so they were very fresh in my mind. There were issues I had with the book, and although I liked the books overall, there were many things that I didn't like about them.This movie I think is an excellent version, as many of the aspects that I found annoying or didn't like from the book are not included, or at least not focused on. To me this made the story that much better.The actors in the movie did a very good job, I found that both leads (Shailene Woodley as Beatrice Prior and Theo James as Four/Tobias) did excellent jobs in their roles. I was initially very hesitant, and didn't want to like them as they were not at all how I pictured the characters, but I am a complete convert. In fact, Theo James did his role so well that I honestly cannot picture that character in any other way except the way he portrayed it. Many of the supporting characters were superb in their small roles as well, Ashley Judd, Kate Winslet, Maggie Q, Jai Courtney, Zoe Kravitz, and Tony Goldwyn, all stood out to me as being excellent in their roles. Some of the other actors I found a bit weak in their parts, but I also realize that might have been because they were not given enough screen time to actually build the nuances of their characters to portray them well.The cinematography and editing I thought was also very well done. I really liked the costume and set designs for this movie, and how well they reflected the factions. From the clothing to their homes, it was all very well thought out on how such a civilization would actually love.The script was also excellent. At no point did I want to role my eyes because it was too silly (which happens a lot with these YA books turned into movies), and it managed to keep you interested in what each character was saying.The story adaptation, again, was also very well done. I cannot think of any part they left out that I felt was absolutely necessary to include, they did very minor story changes, but I also realize that is because to include them would have meant they left an open ended story for viewers who hadn't read the books (which would be very annoying).Overall, I think this is an excellent movie, and I would highly advise anyone who has read the books to go see it, and if you drag your friends who haven't read the books they will enjoy it as well.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A solid 'young adult' dystopia,"This, the first film of three, is set in a world one hundred years after a cataclysmic war. Chicago is effectively a city state and as far as anybody knows there is no civilisation beyond the city. Society is divided into five factions to which people join based on their character type. These are Abnegation, the selfless who are also the governors; Amity, the kind who farm; Erudite, the intelligent; Dauntless, the brave who form the police/army; and Candor, the honest who serve justice. At sixteen people are tested to see which faction best suits them before making the choice as to which they join. Beatrice ""Tris"" Prior, the daughter of Abnegation parents, is one such youngster but her tests are inconclusive... she is 'Divergent'; one with strengths in multiple areas. She is cautioned that she must hide this as Divergents are considered dangerous. The next day she joins Dauntless and begins her training; if she does badly she risks failure and being declared factionless but if she does too well she could be identified as Divergent and killed... if that weren't enough she learns that the leadership of Erudite is planning to overthrow Abnegation.From the moment the world is described it is clear that the viewer will need to be able to suspend their disbelief... the idea that almost everybody will fit into one of the five described factions and Divergents will be rare seems unlikely. However if you can accept that the film is rather fun. The story may not provide many surprises but there are plenty of exciting moments as Tris and her fellow Dauntless recruits undergo initiations and training. There is also frequently a sense of real danger. Tris; as played by Shailene Woodley, who impressed in the role, is a fine protagonist and other key characters are solid too. The film has high production values with a realistic look and impressive effects. Some have compared this to films like 'The Hunger Games' but while there are some similarities I didn't really think about them at the time. Overall I thought this was as solid addition to the young adult dystopia genre... you certainly don't have to be a teenage girl to enjoy it. I'll certainly be watching the other films in the series.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""Divergent"" finds a happy medium between great and awful YA adaptations","In the world of young adult book adaptations with a fantasy/science fiction edge, ""Divergent"" is one of the few to actually fall in between really good and intolerable. It's no ""Hunger Games,"" but director Neil Burger (""Limitless"") and writers Evan Daugherty (""Snow White and the Huntsman"") and Vanessa Taylor (""Game of Thrones"") do a respectable job bringing the Veronica Roth novel to life with maturity and actual filmmaking talent.Having read the book, it's kind of in the same boat. It's not as good as the first ""Hunger Games"" book but it has that same adult, ultra-violent tone with romantic subplots that don't overtake the plot but rank a clear second to it. The dystopian world of ""Divergent"" is far more complicated than ""Hunger Games,"" which widens in scope as the trilogy continues instead of turning the whole world it has built on its head in book one as ""Divergent"" does. Essentially, ""Divergent"" the movie is as good as the material allows it to be, meaning its faults run as deep as those of its source material.That said, ""Divergent"" is an intriguing and engaging story, even if it feels unpolished at times. Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) is a teen living in one of society's five factions in dystopian Chicago. She has reached the age when young people are tested to find out which faction (all of which are based on different virtues) they are best suited to, though in the end they are given a choice no matter what the results say. When Beatrice takes the test, her results are inconclusive. This means she's divergent; she doesn't belong in just one faction, and in a world where everyone is supposed to fit in a specific place, this is dangerous. She chooses to leave her selfless faction, Abnegation, for the bravery and free-spiritedness of Dauntless.Woodley's talent and career trajectory suggests that Summit Entertainment was going for the next Jennifer Lawrence-type to play Tris and she's as good as it gets. With the book being told from the Tris' perspective, it's incumbent on her to communicate the many feelings that Roth so excellently expresses in the book and she does. The rest of the cast isn't too bad either, though only Theo James as Four, Tris' Dauntless mentor-turned-love interest, gets much of a platform. He's every bit of mysterious, dark and handsome as the part necessitates.""Divergent"" sacrifices these side characters in the name of bringing all the memorable plot points of the story to life and explaining Roth's highly intricate dystopian world. There's nothing simple about the faction system for those who haven't read the books, so it eats up some screen time. And with so many scenes and moving pieces, there's little breathing room in the screenplay. The other initiates that Tris befriends (or tangles with) in Dauntless who keep the story grounded in a lot of ways don't develop in the film so that parts including Tris' experiences in the fear simulations, the capture the flag scene and more can all have space in the final cut. ""The Hunger Games"" took a similar philosophy, to let the main character be the real emotional focus of the film and to shut others out, but again, ""Divergent"" is more complicated, and the story doesn't have emotional turning points in the same way ""Hunger Games"" does.Artistically, however, the adaptation does a nice job, even if it borrows on the ""Hunger Games"" aesthetic a little. Burger nails the test and fear simulation scenes, in which Tris experiences a lifelike simulation induced by a serum. He gives them the eerie, larger-than-life quality they require but in a natural way that outdoes the average film's creepy nightmare sequence. The adrenaline rush of Tris' dauntless adventures also comes through. Speaking as a Chicagoan, it would have been nice to see more of the city's actual aesthetic in the film, which is essential to this series, but there's more potential for that in the sequels.So many young adult novel adaptations have been made, and maybe barely 10 percent manage to become ""Twilight"" or ""The Hunger Games."" It isn't and won't become those (even though it's better than ""Twilight""), but ""Divergent"" proves there is room for a successful middle ground in this genre, something it desperately needed.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

Neil Burger gets the important things right.,"As a parent who has been taken into some fairly painful movies, I wasn't sure what to expect with Divergent. I absolutely loved Neil Burger's Limitless, so I was really hoping that he was going to not inflict too much pain on me here. Fortunately for me, and very happily for my daughter, Mr Burger has delivered a solid film that, while it doesn't shatter any expectations, does a nice job of bringing the material to life.Divergent's strongest elements are the wonderfully actualized setting of post-apocalyptic Chicago, and the strength of the varied cast, particularly our young leads. Woodley and James do admirable work as the Heroine and Hero of the film, and I think there is some legitimate chemistry between these two. Burger does a nice job of understating things early on, but showcasing a growing bond between the two as the film progresses.There are some truly great moments on screen throughout. Divergent could have been an utter bomb with the amount of personal soul-searching that goes on, but through an admirable combination of pacing, character development, and fine detailed world building, Divergent never gets too preachy for its own good.There are a few weak moments here and there. The film definitely has a bit of bad-guy monologuing, and you have to wonder where the hell the scene that defined some nefarious back room dealings was, particularly with the star power in this movie. Some exposition at the end is a little uninspiring, and some of the plot is not what one would call a twist.Rough spots aside, the great moments well outweigh the bad. The movie also really steers away from any kind of brutal violence of any kind, as this is easily one of the best PG-13 movies I could recommend for parents in ages. In addition, Woodley's Tris is a wonderful heroine for girls. Tough, complicated, smart, and she doesn't give up.Go ahead and take the family to this one, you won't be disappointed. It may not win best picture in 2014, but Divergent delivers where it needs to and is definitely entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Twilight without vampires,"This movie was terrible. Now I'll admit I didn't have high hopes for it when I saw the trailer but it was TV so I figured what the hell, I'll try it. That was stupid of me. If you liked the sparkling vampires of Twilight you will probably like this snoozefest, but if you are like me, and not a 15 year old girl, take my advice and pass.It's a bad story that's poorly acted. There is no chemistry between the leads, and no connection with them to the audience. It's just hard to care about them. The plot is thin and easy to figure out in the first twenty minutes or so, and the twist, if it deserves that description, will catch no one by surprise. I actually feel a little dumber after watching this movie. I've also lost a little more faith in hollywoods ability to make original and entertaining movies. I see this movie was based on a book. I would hope the book isn't as bad as the movie. If so, whoever read the book and thought ""What a great book!

Divergent Tops The Hunger Games for Vicarious Thrills,"The question everyone who hasn't seen the film, Divergent, wants to know: is Shailene Woodley as effective as Jennifer Lawrence? The difference is in the character development and plot, something neither actress could do anything about.Woodley is as engaging as the rest of the cast that includes Theo James, Ashley Judd, Jai Courtney, Kate Winslet, Maggie Q and Ray Stevenson. Woodley, who looks like she could be Lawrence's sister, was seriously considered for The Hunger Games, and was expected to have the lead in Catching Fire, but Lawrence made it back. Catching Fire has a more decipherable plot than The Hunger Games. Woodley's ""Tris"" in Divergent is as wonderful as Lawrence's character, ""Katniss."" It's easy to love them both.Divergent, a young adult book transferred to film, is as entertaining as any following the dystopian trend that includes The Hunger Games and its sequel, Catching Fire. For adults who enjoyed those films, then Divergent does it one better. Not that The Hunger Games was not a good film; it was done very well. However; the society and logic for the games don't work for all some of us reality-thinking adults.If we were thinking on a broader scale, we might ask a lot of questions if we wanted to, but we don't. These films, including Divergent, based on young adult books, are voyeuristic in that they involve prying observation of ""our own children"" represented on screen. We want to see our children brave, heroic and caring. We'd like them to save the world we messed up. For grown-ups, Divergent and The Hunger Games are still vicarious thrills. We love watching the young win--even it is against others the same age. As long as those hurt or killed are deserving (meaning bad guys) or going to kill the good guys.What makes Divergent different from the rest (and I don't pretend to know all the films made or being made in this vein today) is that the scene is on a larger scale and the young are entry-level to the scene. Their journey is just beginning. Grown-ups have already screwed things up by dividing society by its values. Evil has the usual melodramatic pervasiveness in these films; there is always a villain to make what seems to be a good plan (the world as it is presented to us) even better.That said, Divergent is a decent science fiction film that teaches a lesson to society--or by direct consumption-- teenagers in the world. Teens have questions about who they are or who they should. They questions their actions and reactions constantly. Unlike utopias that portray a perfect world, dystopias portray a world in need. Teenagers, needy or not, can identify with a world in need. The audience or reader sees the distorted world vision, but the characters--the society does not. To be dramatic, most dystopian science fiction we see on film is usually so dark and so grim as to be unrealistic. Most of the world is destroyed by war either among themselves or by aliens.Good science fiction tackles what we should or shouldn't do as a society when it comes to science or technology. And, especially for film, I think it helps to have a positive ending.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Riveting Dystopian Sci-Fi Yarn,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4/5 starsThis is one of those rare occasions that a movie based on a recent young-adult novel has been done right, so savor it for what it's worth. And, worth it is, quite a lot, going by the terrific 2 hour 10 minutes ride you get through the stark dystopian landscape of ""Divergent"". What's more, the movie is not just about bleak dystopian locations and the direct bearing they have on the daily lives of their characters, but it also shrewdly manages to raise some highly pertinent questions about our own existence and what sort of world we could be leaving for the coming generations. The most uplifting fact about ""Divergent"" is that it pulls off this unexpected act through astute direction and some incredibly nuanced performances we usually don't associate with summer blockbusters.While, Kate Winslet is an old warhorse and has played practically every type of role with grace and confidence, Shailene Woodley is a revelation, and proves yet again why her name is being taken in the same breath these days with Jennifer Lawrence as one of Hollywood's brightest, upcoming female talents. She captures the desperation, confusion, grit, determination, vulnerability, and tenacity of her character with the kind of self-assured conviction and realism you'd associate with seasoned performers. Kate Winslet as usual just shows up and reminds us of her immense abilities in every frame she's in, playing the villain with menace and an uncompromising faith in her misguided beliefs. Ashley Judd lend great support in the few scenes she's in. Sadly, the rest of the cast offers nothing worth penning down.Now we all are well aware that this film is based on the first of a series of best selling fiction novels by author Veronica Roth, but as alluded to earlier, it's an aberration that the core elements of a good novel are retained while making it viable for a cinematic audience within cinematic time-constraints. For this reason alone, due credit must be bestowed upon screen-writers Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor for brilliantly adapting a recently loved novel, fresh in readers' memory, and transforming into a crisp screenplay that the Director and producers could work with. But, a screenplay - adapted or original - no matter how good, needs proper guidance, and this is provided with assured measure through the watchful eyes of Director, Neil Burger (known for accomplished efforts such as ""The Illusionist"" (2006), ""The Lucky Ones"" (2008), and ""Limitless"" (2011)). Alwin H. Küchler's cinematography could have been engaging and Richard Francis-Bruce and Nancy Richardson's editing could have been crisper, but thankfully they do not steer too far away from the plot.""Divergent"" not only gives us a fantastically entertaining blockbuster to thrill and chill us for w hours plus, it also offers up a thought- provoking sci-fi tale, which begs us to reflect on some startling points it raises even while we're being enthralled by the proceeding on-screen - something of an oddity in modern cinema. Along with being faithful to Roth's book, it also builds a strong cinematic universe apt for the screen and successfully manages to engage both sections of viewers - those who've enjoyed Roth's novel and even those who have no prior knowledge of the happenings of her dystopian fiction series. ""Divergent"" is basically a must-see for all who enjoy a thoroughly gripping, judicious sci-fi tale.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
High school dystopia,"I am a bit surprised that very few reviewers seem to have caught what this is really about. They seem to miss that the world depicted is a high school, seen from the perspective of a typical student. Nobody seems to work; everybody is learning. Teachers have complete authority, with the kids making limited and largely uninformed choices. Their prospects are largely ""becoming a successful member of society"" or ""failing and becoming a hobo"". Bullying and suicide are real issues.In ""Divergent"", society is organized based on a faction system: factions stand for many things, including castes, professions, traits of character, rites of passage, dress codes... But most of all, they represent the cliques that form in high school: the cool kids (dauntless), the nerds (erudite), the hippies (amity). Due to this, the relevance of the factions for society is a bit bogus; for example, as many reviewers have noted, the Dauntless would make terrible cops or soldiers... But that is besides the point! The dauntless are merely the cool kids, complete with bullies, hot guys, hot girls, extreme sports, and excessive drama.While belonging to these cliques, most real-world teenagers also feel that they are unique snowflakes. Pretty much every real person felt that way as a teenager; but teenagers are not yet aware of that. In the movie, the unique snowflakes are called ""divergents"": people who do not fully belong in any clique, who are a bit more than a stereotype. Obviously, the heroine and her boyfriend are ""divergents"", unlike ""99%"" of other characters, who are just sheep within their respective cliques.All in all, this is merely a teenage fantasy. The heroin has doubts about who she is, where she belongs; she succeeds in becoming one of the cool kids; she finds a boyfriend; and at the same time, she retains her ""incredibly unique"" personality. And we confidently expect her to go on to become a successful revolutionary, changing the world for the better, and fulfilling the entire fantasy, acquiring fame and social status in the process.It is easy to see why this was successful with its target audience. Watch it if you want a high school flick set in the future, with some added fist- and gun-fights; don't watch it if you want serious sci-fi. To enjoy it at all, you have to see this movie for what it really is. As a 29 year old man, I found it amusing. I ended up caring for the characters despite their stereotypical personalities and had a good time.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What a waste of time!,"I saw this movie with a free theatre ticket I got from work, and still felt screwed over for wasting my time. Can't believe the high IMDb status. Infantile plot, boring dialogue, predictable and totally unconvincing. It's a film I can imagine being aired on a kids TV channel some Sunday afternoon. I struggle to write the minimum 10 lines I'm supposed to write to post this review, as there's nothing more really I can say about it. I tried thinking of possible metaphors the film aimed to suggest, some unconventional take on things, some acting spark. Maybe it's just me, but unfortunately I can't find a single positive thing to say. Except perhaps that its produced quite OK, but which movie isn't today. So for lack of anything better to say, I'm just gonna finish those ten lines by repeating my second sentence: Infantile plot, boring dialogue, predictable and totally unconvincing.

Been There! Done That! Got the T-shirt!,"There is a definite hunger games vibe to this film. Not just in the storyline, but even in the way and the style that it is filmed. I do wonder, however, whether it might not have been better received it had been released first?I don't personally think that Shailene Woodley was the best choice as the lead, although I haven't read the books yet to say that she isn't a good version of the author's character.Theo James is not only handsome, but he plays his part well and although he's annoying, so does Miles Teller. I think that perhaps if the film hadn't been so rushed, we would have seen more of them both. Having said that, I did struggle to tell some of the male characters apart.There are times when I found the violence to be a bit much. I will never understand why some military branches feel the need to beat the strength out of people. Everyone has a place, it might just be admin or Medicine instead of fighting.It's not a bad story, it's just one we already know. It's a shame that there are so many of a similar ilk out there now.

For Teen Girls,"It's for teen girls. Telling them to be brave, to be diversified. It's telling them to have many interests, and aspects to one's self. And that is a good thing. As a film, it was fine. The action was okay, the pace was okay, the characters and actors were fine. In my time, gender roles were very strict. Girls didn't do boy things; and boys didn't do girl things. I think the author of the story is trying to say that people are diversified. They are divergent. In the story, the leaders feared diversity; because it is harder to control. So they doubled down. But maybe if people were allowed to be free, they wouldn't be so mean.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Movies vs. Books.,"I do not understand how anyone would expect this movie to be identical to the book. There are things that they have to do differently in the movie for certain reasons. Have you ever actually watched a movie based on a book that did everything like the book said? Of course not! To take words and bring them to life for readers on the silver screen means that things will be changed or taken away from because you just cant film some things to the T. For the most part they stayed very true to the book, with the exception of a few parts. I don't see what the big deal is. I read the book over five times and I was very impressed with the movie. When I first heard that Shailene Woodley had the role of Tris, I was worried, but she did an amazing job and so did the rest of the cast. Veronica Roth seemed happy with the outcome and I think that's because she knew that they couldn't do everything exactly as she wrote it. Neil Burger did an amazing job directing because he made everything look real. It wasn't computerized or anything of that sort. I'm very proud of the cast and crew for creating a wonderful adaption of this book! Can't wait for Insurgent!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

disappointing,"I loved the book, which probably set me up to be disappointed by this movie. To me, it seemed that important parts were missing and random things added. Peter came off as a light hearted jerk instead of a dangerous sociopath and Four just happened to suddenly like Tris. These were important things to develop. Instead, time was taken to have a show down with Janine at the end??? It wasn't just the deviation from the book. I saw this movie with a Divergent-virgin and he asked me multiple times if it was almost over. He felt lost and confused.

A poor man's 'Hunger Games',"I have not read the novel but as a movie, this was disappointing. Many people watch movies just because they have been adapted from great books but I don't believe a film should rely on a great novel. This movie is poorly executed and could have been so much better. There are striking similarities to 'The Hunger Games' but there is no comparison to how well 'The Hunger Games' has been made and the exceptional performance of 'Jennifer Lawrence'. In contrast 'Divergent', which also featured a futuristic society governed by a strict regime with numerous divisions, is not convincing and none of the characters are strong enough for the viewer to care about them. The movie seems to end up becoming a teenage romance tale and the climax is confusing and dull. Even the main theme of being a 'Divergent' is not explored or really explained, maybe this has been reserved for a sequel. However based on this movie, I definitely won't bother with any follow up movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Hmmm I used to trust IMDb scores.,This movie is the hunger games which I can totally see why they made it because THG made a bazillion dollars god knows how as it's total crap and since this movie is designed squarely at that market it's pretty close to THG and such is pretty crap itself. I thought this was a stand alone movie but checking IMDb they are making 2 3 and 4 in the same ilk as THG /facepalm.I also have another issue with the rating on this movie I have just read through loads and loads of user reviews on IMDb for this and there are 3 6's maybe 2 or 3 over 6 and hundreds of 3 or less scores but the score on IMDb is a 7.1????? how does that work???? 95% of the reviews for this movie are terrible and rate it really low but it's getting a 7.1???? Anyway it just shows how strong the teenage girl market is because this is squarely where this film is targeted. The rot set in with twilight then the hunger games jumped in behind and now this. Well I'm this is going to make a lot of rich studio execs even richer GUYS YOU HAVE MORE MONEY THAT YOU CAN SPEND STOP MAKING THIS CRAP!!!!,6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Worth seeing in UltraAVX!,"Awesome movie. The movie plays with the theme that society tries to force us into a specific box when we really wish we were free to do many different things with our lives. The story exaggerates this theme by reducing people to five different personality types. Once they reach adulthood, all people are forced to choose and live by one set of rules only. The main character, Tris, does not fit conveniently into any one type so she is considered dangerous because she cannot be controlled. Even though this is being compared to Hunger Games (young people in combat in a dystopian future), it is actually completely different. Only the setting is the same. There were a few minor details that could have been corrected. This is a must watch for any fans of Sci-Fi, action, or even if you just like to see a female in a lead role. Loved it. P.S. - If you have not yet seen the trailer, watch it after the movie. It revealed a bit too much.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Divergent,"Ever since I saw him in a UK television drama entitled ""Bedlam"" (2011) I thought that Theo James (""Number Four"") was a man to watch. He was certainly the hook that got me to start watching these adaptations of Veronica Roth's futuristic novels. Well, beauty can only take you so far; the rest has to be down to acting; dialogue etc. And this falls pretty flat on all counts. The premiss is unique - society is divided into five factions based on a perception of virtue. At 16, teenagers have to decide which they have and then they spend their lives living up to the ideals - involving strenuous mental and physical trials. ""Tris Prior"" (Shailene Woodley"") is an exception, however - she doesn't fit into any one category - and so the system has no idea how to cope with this renegade. When she reveals her confused status to James - her trainer - we embark on a tale of cat and mouse as she and a rag-bag gang of misfits set out to save a world that deems them all as a serious threat. It certainly looks good - budget clearly was not an huge issue, and it is broadly faithful to the book but therein lies the problem - it is a preposterous proposition from the outset - it has not even the weakest of anchors from the society we know today (i.e. How the hell could we ever have gotten ourselves into this kind of dystopian mess in the first place?). When romance begins to rear it's head too, then I started to forget how sexy Theo actually is and wonder what else I could watch... There are clearly some parallels with ""The Hunger Games"" series, but this one definitely comes off a very poor second.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

D I V E R G E N T,"Divergent is a science fiction film in action, fantasy and adventure. The divergent was officially released on March 18, 2014 in Los Angeles. The film was directed by Neil Burger, Evan Daugherty, and Vanessa Taylor.
The divergent tells of the city of Chicago which was destroyed by war. To create peace, 5 factions formed according to personality. Abnegation that is unselfish and simple. Erudite is smart and prioritizes science. Good and peaceful Amity, Candor who prioritizes honesty, and Dauntless who is brave and free. Whereas Divergent are people who have more than one faction in their personality.
Children who are 16 years old must take a test to choose a faction. After the test, Tris has 3 results there are Abnegation, Dauntless, and Erudite. Tris must keep his identity as a Divergent. During the selection ceremony, Tris finally chose Dauntless. It turns out that only 10 people will be elected as official Dauntless members. Because of abstinence and intelligence, Tris managed to become a member of Dauntless.
But chaos occurs when Erudite controls Dauntless's brain to attack Abnegation. Tris who is not affected by serum pretends like the others. At that time, Tris knew that For was also a Divergent. Eventually an attack was carried out by Erudite against Abnegation. In addition, Divergent hunting is also underway. However, all can be thwarted by Tris, Four, Marcus, Caleb, and Peter. The five of them fled with the train go to beyond the wall.

A Review of the Script of Divergent,"Imagine living in a futuristic society where all life is divided into five factions based on virtues, and everyone must fit into exactly one of these five factions or their lives are at stake. This scenario presents exactly the basis for the movie Divergent, a film version of author Veronica Roth's novel. The film follows an adolescent girl named Tris Prior on her adventure of growth and survival in a dystopian society. Each year there is a ""Choosing Ceremony"" in which all children who have turned sixteen must choose which faction they will spend the rest of their lives in. In an extremely difficult decision, Tris finds herself in the faction she will call home, fighting for a place to become an officially initiated member. When Tris finds out that she is what the leaders of society call ""Divergent,"" it is evident that she cannot be controlled or fit into just one faction. This discovery means that Tris must fight for her life as the leaders of society hunt down and attempt to kill all Divergents, who threaten the faction system. While the story line of the novel written by Roth proves brilliantly entertaining and catches the attention of readers, the movie script seems to lack the zeal with which the story was originally written. The script for the movie Divergent destroys the entertaining, suspenseful, and emotionally endearing story line originally created by Veronica Roth in her novel.Divergent's movie script fails to develop important emotional aspects of the story that are crucial to very plot and development it. The story is virtually all about identity and the development of one's self. And the people that appear in Tris's life play a huge role in her development and growth into adulthood. Unfortunately, the characters presented in the movie are incredibly underdeveloped and their impact on Tris's life is nearly impossible to fully see. As Christy Lemire said in her published review of Divergent on the Roger Ebert Memoriam Website, ""the supporting figures who had identifiable personalities in the book mostly blend into the background in the movie."" This tragedy can be very well seen through many characters, but most importantly through one specific antagonist to Tris. The character of Peter in the movie appears to be a background figure, one of Tris's competitors for a spot in her faction. He comes off as sarcastic, fairly mean, and sometimes even funny. However, in the original story presented through Roth's novel, Peter is evil. There is certainly no better word to describe him other than evil. As Tris's arch nemesis, he attacks her physically and verbally any chance he gets. Many mean remarks directed at Tris leave his mouth, but not one of them could be described as remotely funny. He even goes to the length of stabbing a fellow initiate in the eye with a butter knife during the night just to knock out his biggest competition. He touches Tris inappropriately before trying to kill her, which scars her permanently. Peter is portrayed as almost a completely different character in the movie compared to his true self in the book. This lack of development of his character along with others proves to take out a large emotional influence important to the story. The script lacks ways in which the truth behind many characters could come out, and this contributes to the detriment of emotional development in the story.Not only does the script for Divergent contribute to the lack of character and emotional advancement, but it also contributes to the weakness in entertaining and attention-holding abilities of the movie. ABC News put out a review by David Blaustein claiming that ""Divergent is a mildly entertaining movie that only succeeds because of its talented cast."" First of all, most of the movie is consumed by long hours for Tris and the other initiates training and completing activities to earn their place in the faction. This training consumes over half the movie and easily loses the attention of the viewers. Secondly, due to the fact that characters are underdeveloped, relationships are also underdeveloped. The core relationship between Tris and her love interest, Four, develops through many encounters and complications in Roth's novel; however, in the movie it remains a surface level relationship that develops quickly. The lack of complexity to the relationship in the movie causes a lack of attachment from viewers to the movie. Like Blaustein stated, the movie only overcomes the lack of relationships and entertainment through the sheer talent of the actors.Overall, Divergent succeeded in the movie business, making thousands of dollars in profit. However, the movie itself is ultimately a failure. It did not successfully portray the thought provoking, emotionally endearing, and attention- grabbing story originally written by Veronica Roth in her novel. Although the movie basically followed the plot of the story, it removed the important relationships and characters that were developed in the book and that were essential to the success of the story. The movie script dissected the brilliant novel written by Roth and took out parts that gave the story the emotional depth it needed to reach its full potential. As the most important thing that makes up a movie, the script of Divergent damages the movie itself and weakens the overall success of the film.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Unfortunately this series lacks in the qualities the made THG so great first and foremost the main character. Katniss is a born - if not reluctant- leader where Tris, our Divergent heroine is more milquetoast. Just like The Maze Runner, the first movie in the series is the best and the last, kinda sucks. Practically the whole thing is shot in front of a green screen and for this era, the CGI is pretty basic. I like a Dystopian YA stuff and really wanted to like this series but it's never more than ok. In THG you cannot help but cheer for Katniss, really feel her pain but with Tris is like whatev.

Yes, there could have been more background ( i had to look it up to continue seeing the 5 classes and what they meant ) and why doesn't she kill a lot of the bad people, i have no idea but kills a close friend instead. Very frustrating at times overall creative though",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A struggle to watch,"Divergent is one of those movies that is so bad that you will force yourself to sit through the entire thing simply to see what ridiculousness is gonna come up next. This movie is BORING, predictable, cliché, poorly acted, overly girlie, nonsensical, and the plot line is paper thin. I felt as if I was watching a project put together by high-school kids, who just happened to have a decent budget. There isn't a speck of creativity or intelligence in this piece of crap. I'm the type of person who yells at the television a lot to begin with when I see nonsense, but this movie will make anyone with half a brain yell and shake their head in agony throughout, even if you never do that.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Classic story in futuristic word,"The movie is about a teenage girl living in a futuristic San Francisco city. Society is separated into five different factions to prevent war and maintained peace. Every year, all of the sixteen-years must choose where they belong, during a ceremony. Which will be choosen by our protagonist? How her live will go on after that? Will she be succeeded in new environment or choose to stay home with her family?Choices, adapting and working on our weaknesses are the main topics in this movie. With every obstacle defeated, comes another one, more powerful than before. The movie teach us to never give up and always fight for our dreams.There always is a ""but"". The last act of the movie could be better, some events happens without a reason, because ""story needs it"".Music is well made.About the actors.Not perfect, but good performance from young crew, and perfect, as always, Kate Winslet.Nice camera work, and well prepared special effects (not much of them, because not much was needed for the story).This is a classic, well made story, which does not surprise us with anything above that.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One Choice Can Transform You,"The United States of America is not what we once knew – the nation was split and the government was run out by factions – 5 to be exact: Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless and Erudite. With everyone in these factions it was going to be a peaceful world until one day one girl, one test result can change the way our minds can change who we are – Divergent! One faction the Erudite comes in and destroys the peaceful nation by catapulting a ruthless attempt to rid the world of Divergents and the overrule the government so they can get their way with the leadership of one woman – Jeanine Matthews (played beautifully by Kate Winslet.) I don't want to spoil the rest of the movie for the people who have not seen the movie but I will say this – this movie was lacking in some places where things were left unsaid, action was left out and things were changed up a bit.This movie was an awesome way of letting dive into a young writers mind of how she sees the world, Veronica Roth who at the time was 23 when she wrote this book. The book was action packed and so was the movie, matter of fact the movie was incredible. The cast ranging from Shailene Woodley to Theo James to the wonderful Ashley Judd and Zoe Kravitz (yes that is Lenny's daughter!) to the villainous Kate Winslet.But the question remains is: Which faction will you choose?

"4/10. Four, like the character","I have incredibly low expectations when it comes to young adult movies, and yet, I'm still disappointed. Many of you claimed that it is really similar to the hunger games. Well... yes and no. Divergent is stupider.First of all : the credits are still rolling and I don't know why there was a war and why dividing people into five district... I mean factions is gonna help maintaining peace. This is BS. No explanations, nothing. And we meet our lead character Kat... I mean Tris (notice how Katniss and Tris sound similar) played by Shailene Woodley. And for me, this is the first mistake they made in this movie. Woodley... I just don't like her. Her voice, her face, everything.But the crap really hits the fan when you learn that not only is she divergent but that this is something rare... How ? I mean, have you ever been 16 and not knowing what you wanted to be when you grow up or is everybody in this lousy version of Chicago conditioned or something ? I call BS on this part. Being divergent is not something rare especially at the age the characters are. It's not, and this is why the movie makes little sense.2nd problem : the factions. How does it maintain peace to restraint people to one single way of living for the rest of their lives ? And what about the faction-less (or homeless. It's literally the same thing) people ? They don't care about their fate ? They don't want abundant food and a home ? I mean, they can build a giant wall but can't feed the poor ? How perfect is that ?3rd problem : choosing a faction is nonsense. They don't even get to ""try"" them. If factions really have to fit who they are, they should be able to walk in their shoes for at least 48h each. Instead, they are giving a false choice : either you stay home safe or you explore the unknown with the risk of being kicked out. Concretely : it would not maintain peace IRL.Final major problem : The chemistry between Tris and Four is fake. In one of the early scenes of the movie, Four gives her the most beautiful, powerful middle finger ever : ""What makes you think you can talk to me ?"" And she doesn't seem to remember it afterwards, and worst of all, they don't share that much special moments in the movie. Their love seems forced by the circumstances.So, the plot is nonsense, the character development is poor, and so is the acting. I haven't talked about the action sequences at all, but trust me, it's not worth mentioning. Finally, the climax is... unexpectedly bad and makes little sense. I'm trying to keep the review spoiler-free so go watch it for yourself and you'll know what I'm talking about.",,Anonymous,Mystery
I am without speech,"I had heard nothing about this movie before I began to watch it. After seeing the first 10 minutes, I can confidently say that I could predict the mind numbing 6 plus hours remaining in the trilogy. There are so many things wrong with this (recurring) movie adapted from the same model based on books with the same recurring story (characters, themes, etc.).This laughable new genre of Teen Trilogies are todays version of the Mad-Libs books from my grade school days... except they are unable to turn the page to another storyline, are restricted to the same repetitive word bank and only able to exhibit originality through the cool first names assigned to the leading female protagonist.The next Trilogy should be centered on a young author who discovers that all books are now only written by huge corporations aimed at maximizing profits (through follow up movies, documentaries, theme parks and related products) and how he/she plans on burning the whole boring system to the ground.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One Of The Best Book-To-Movie Adaptations Yet!,"I don't know what the other reviewers went and saw but as a MAJOR fan of the books I can say that Divergent was AMAZING. As the title states, it was the best book-to-movie adaptations yet. It was so accurate and was so honest to the books that it just blew my mind. Ever scene was so true to the books that it amazed me. Of course they had to cut out a few minor scenes for the length but I have never been so proud and happy. It was a really long movie like about 2 hours and 30 minutes give or take and I'm glad it was so long because they had a chance to include everything. The acting was great. Shailene Woodley was pretty great, she really understood Tris and Theo James and her chemistry was really beautiful. I really really liked the movie and I want to go see it again. I am so very impressed and I really look forward to Insurgent.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good choice,"Another movie based on a bestselling novel. I think the first time I heard about this flick was when I went to see Beautiful Creatures, which is also based on a bestselling novel. I first herd of that movie when I went to see the Host, which if I'm not mistaken is also based on a bestselling novel. You get the idea. It's good to hear that young girls are reading novels.Though these movies are for young girls mostly, I do get a kick out of them. After all, most of them are centered on some super natural creatures or have a large Sci-Fi theme. This movie takes place in a post-apocalyptic Chicago, which was visually awesome by the way. A War broke out about a 100 years ago, and In order to bring back order in a world fallen apart, the society sectioned off its people into 5 Fractions and when a child is old enough, they take a test to decided which fraction they actually belong too. Most people go back to the fractions they were born into with very few being chosen for a different Fraction, However in the case of the main character Beatrice, the test were not conclusive, meaning she would not fit into any Fraction. The people of this world refer to this as Divergent and being such is not good.The movie screams the message for young girls to grow up and be what they want to be, especially with the plot of Beatrice, who was born into a Fraction of mostly boring framers, choosing to join the fraction of really, really enthusiastic Law Enforcers. Although I can't help but to point out the similarities in this movie to The Hunger Games, and I must admit, though I find Beatrice who becomes Tris when she joins the Dauntless fraction, warmer than Katniss Everdeen, I realize if I have a Choice, I prefer my female protagonist tougher . There were way too many times in the movie that Tris' boy toy, Four, one of the leaders and trainers of the Dauntless, had to come to her rescue. In all fairness, this may have something to do with the fact that unlike most Super heroines that have been exploiting the big screen lately, Tris has no love triangle. She has 5 chooses to where her life will go, but only one choice in men. Maybe in the Sequel?The movie has a pretty well-known cast. Some people I knew by name like Miles Teller, who co-stared in the Spectacular Now, with Shailene Woodley, who played Tris. I felt a little sorry for the guy as he had a chance to grow in this movie outside of being type cast the sarcastic easy going best friend thing he's been doing in a lot of flicks, but it did not happen. Zoe Kravitz, who plays Tris BBF, taking after her father Lenny Kravitz, who is in the Hunger Games. Ashley Judd, who has a small but important role as Tris' mother and Naomi Watts who put on a little weight since the last time I've seen her, but still looks hot. Then their where a few faces that seem to float around the teen to young adult movies.The movie does a good job in appealing to a lot of people. Its starts as a dramatic film focusing greatly on the society these people live in, which I found unique in a movie of this caliber, but they give you a nice helping of action as well.It was a good choice for a movie to see, but I like hunger games better.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Detergent,"Take any C-movie in the SF genre, wash it at 90 degree C until all colors are gone and that is what ""Divergent"" does.A silly and unrealistic plot with no other place than maybe in a teenager TV series.All society divided in factions according to character: kind people, brave people, intelligent people and so on...not even the Japanese TV dramas have such a rigid classification of roles for its characters.I read somewhere that Kate Winslet took the role because of her empathy with a story again against all-controlling regimes, but....her more than excellent acting skills are definitely wasted here.Rent ""Barbarella"", if you are in the mood for an easy SF movie, and you'll have a much better experience.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The Five Factions,"In a futuristic society the population is divided into castes based on aptitude tests. The names should give you an idea of what direction the people are led into. Erudite, Candor, Amity, Abegnation, and the warrior caste Dauntless. It's this caste that is the defender of the established order. Of course there's a lot of folks out there who are casteless, didn't make the grade in any caste and now are something along the lines of the Hindu untouchable. But the rarest of all are those people whose intelligence quotient is so high they can test into any category. They are called Divergent and the established order fears them because they can move chameleon like into any faction.Shailene Woodley is such a Divergent, but she's taught to mask it well. To the surprise of many she chooses Dauntless and goes into basic training for Dauntless far more rigorous for this Spartan group than the others. Woodley also discovers a plot to turn this warrior society into some kind of Fascistic tool and this is where the action truly starts.An interesting idea if not entirely carried out successfully testing for whatever virtues one possesses for your role in society. The great unwashed out there who don't fit in are accounted for. What seems to be missing here is an account for those bad character flaws just where do they go. I suspect they are the villains of the piece but a society as advanced as should test out those people as well.Woodley makes a nice and earnest lead supported by fellow Dauntless member Theo James a young man who sees what Dauntless is being subverted into. Also note Kate Winslet who is one of the subverters.Divergent is a nice if not entirely successful portrait of a futuristic society.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Agitprop or teen drama?,"Andrew O'Hehir writes in his Salon piece that ""The Hunger Games,"" and ""Divergent"" are propaganda. Then he says they are not propaganda in the usual sense of the word but rather propaganda in the service of ""individualism."" Individualism, according to O'Hehir, is the central idea behind consumer capitalism and is the bogey man we are all to fear. This is rubbish. I would suggest that going from a young woman's view of present day society as a glorified high school drama about not fitting as is the case with ""Divergent"" to political agitprop is a dangerous leap and a bit of a stretch. O'hehir goes on to say that we must accept the premise that all imagined worlds of the future must be about the present; a dubious conjecture at best. Where, he asks, are the fascist forces demanding conformity? Where is the segregation of society to be found? Where is the regimentation that we see depicted these movies? Is he serious? One just has to open one's eyes and look around to see plenty. Look at the paramilitary swat teams that have grown up in so many cities across America. Look at the spying on citizens that goes on by the NSA, Facebook, and Google. The pressure to conform has never been greater. Society is most certainly segmented into strata and classes. From the highest to the lowest, by race and by gender. And let's not forget about the struggles of the LBGT community. In the workplace, if you don't conform you are out. I would argue that the oppressive societies shown in the ""Hunger Games"" and ""Divergent"" are in fact allegorical to our present day times. They are cautionary tales as to what the future may hold. The central message presented by ""Divergent"" is to beware of labeling or ""pigeon holing"" people based on personality traits or some form of arbitrary and rigid caste system that offers no upward or lateral mobility.The place where I would agree with O'Hehir is that ""Divergent,"" while entertaining, was unsophisticated and simplistic. But what do you expect? It was based on the first of a series of novels written by a young woman geared for a young adult audience. I was willing to suspend my disbelief for a well- intentioned, well made, good effort that had much to offer including a strong female lead that was empowering to her and presented a good role model for other girls to follow. This, I think, is a good trend. If you want to see real capitalist agitprop, check out Howard Roark's speech in The Fountain Head, a movie based on the Ayn Rand novel of the same name. In this speech you can catch a glimpse the ideology of the individual versus the collective that O'Hehir is so agitated about.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Highly recommended movie -- Four !,"I read the books and Veronica Roth is a versatile author. So let's talk about the movie... Of course not all the contents in a book can be displayed in a movie but still it was well-interpreted according to me and I really loved the movie. Shailene Woodley and Theo James were great as Tris and Four. They played their characters up to the level. Theo James was perfect as Four. He is such a good actor and I just loved his acting in Divergent. There could not be a better actor to play the role of Four. Theo was amazing and perfect just as in the book. Certain people will not like the movie or compare it to the Hunger games but truly speaking though it's a dsytopian movie as the Hunger games, Divergent has a different storyline and is simply awesome to watch. They took some difficult scenarios from the books which were very well shown in the movie.I would highly recommend people to watch Divergent. I can't wait to watch the sequel.

"Thrilling, romantic, action packed, intense and visually stunning.","Divergent. This film is now my number 1 favorite film of 2014 so far. It has beaten the new 300 film, Paranormal Acitvity: TMO, TWOWS and Non-Stop. Here is why:It has an brilliant and breathtaking storyline packed with romance, violence and some pretty mind bending scenes.It is centred around a girl who must chose a faction to live in as after a great war, a city is divided into factions (Kind of like The Hunger Games) and when their time comes they are tested to see what faction to join. She joins a faction of elite sort of peacekeepers but soon realises that it has now become a fight for survival.It had some of the most tense scenes I have seen in a long time and at times I cheered for certain parts of the movie.However; this is more of a teen movie, so adults may be a little disappointed with this movie.

The Premise I daresay was decent enough for an engaging Sci Fi movie, but this falls flat on its face so hard it broke its jaw and nose within the first 15 minutes. A good lead actress in a shoddy plot/screenplay, crawling along at a horrible pace with no direction whatsoever. Please avoid this movie, even when it ends up on Cable in a month or so.

The Vidiot Reviews...,"DivergentIn most dystopian scenarios the human race is divided into two groups: meat and not meat.However, the futuristic civilization in this sci-fi film is split into five.Abnegation (altruistic) from birth, Tris (Shailene Woodley) was raised in a post-apocalyptic Chicago.On her 16th birthday, she gets to decide if she would rather be Amity (passive), Erudite (academic), Candor (truthful) or Dauntless (fearless).While she chooses the latter, her State aptitude test revels she is all five, and thus Divergent.Meanwhile, the head of Erudite (Kate Winslet) is using mind-control on Dauntless soldiers to eradicate the Abnegation.Based on the popular YA novel, Divergent mimics others of its ilk in terms of it hierarchical society and puerile romance; however, it deviates from the pack when it comes to its higher caliber of acting and directing.Incidentally, allotment in any setting - apocalyptic or not - is usually by someone's race.Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

deja vu!,"You know how we rate dogs on the intelligence scale? By their ability to obey human commands and perform their predefined roles. In many ways, in muggle or wizard world, this quality of every entity doing their predefined role is man's vision of a perfect society. However, it is in human nature to sacrifice altruism over ambition, and hence the only two factions that will stand the test of time are the oppressed and the oppressor.Divergent is the latest movie adaption of yet another young adult dystopian novel by the same name, written by Veronica Roth. Typical of the genre, it explores themes such as friendship, love, relationship with families and authority figures, diversity and socioeconomic status through a young lead character, Tris Prior, played by Shailene Woodley.""Faction before blood""Sometime in the future, society in Chicago is divided into five factions- Abnegation (selfless), Amity (peaceful), Candor (truthful), Erudite (intelligent) and Dauntless (brave), based on their personalities. Much like the sorting hat, young 16 year old citizens have to undergo a test that defines their fit. While most conform to these factions, there are a few who display characteristics of all the five factions, called Divergents. These folks can think independently, and not according to pre defined norms, which makes them a threat to the social order government, so are usually terminated. Tris is born in an Abnegation family, but her results show that she is a divergent, and to stay alive she chooses Dauntless.And why not. In a slew of drab, the fearless, military faction members are uber chic- get to wear snazzy black, put on cool tattoos, fight peek-a-boo style and get to jump on and off running trains. The initiation and trainings in this faction are severe tests of strength, conviction and courage. All is not well though, as the Erudites and the Dauntless leadership collude to bring down the rule of the Abnegation, leading to a final showdown as Tris struggles to fight for her parents. While the movie by itself is reasonably good, there is a feeling of deja vu. The success of Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, and the Twilight Saga have led to film producers treating young adult fiction movies like stones thrown in the dark, hoping for a hit. There has been more misses than hits. The hits managed to transcend its audience, from young adults to adults. While the film adaptations of the misses- such as The Host, The Mortal Instruments, The Golden Compass, Percy Jackson were made in a way that they appealed to only their fan base.My feelings after watching Divergent were mixed. The good is that it largely eschews spectacle for substance. Considerable amount of time given to develop the characters, and their motives. There is no shortage of grit- the characters embrace the violence gratuitously. But the script is utterly predictable, and that is kind of sad for a movie that is all about being different. No wonder Shailene Woodley is so talked about these days. When she smiles, she lights up the screen. Pity though the script allows her to do it so little. Also, since this is a trilogy, director Neil Burger stays away from giving us three climaxes (one in each movie), rather keeps setting up things for subsequent films, which makes the ending of this movie a bit non entertaining.Strictly popcorn fare. Fans will love it though- 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Really liked should have loved it,I actually really enjoyed this film. Thought it had a really cool story line and lots of fairly original ideas ( it's very hard these days ) kind of a mix of Hunger games and equilibrium if I had to do a comparison. Major complaint is the trying to get the teen audience. If they had ignored this and taken a let's just do a cool movie I think it would have been a lot better. No harm in having an underlying romance (matrix) but it's just to in your face and distracts from what could have been a much more gritty movie.

Save your money...,"So I went into this movie wanting to be impressed by it. I didn't know much about it but was hoping for it to be a fun movie. I waited patiently for what had to be around 3 hours for the plot to pick up and get interesting. I checked my watch and alas only about 30 minutes had actually elapsed and to my further dismay the movie never did get interesting and the plot remained rather lack luster.I usually love movies set in a dystopia, but this one was on par with watching paint dry. The acting was average and that's being very generous. The action was weak. The plot was weaker. The romance forced. The characters were flat.Also try not to laugh when Tris yells ""stop it"" to the bad guys during a scene that isn't suppose to be funny yet you can't help but laugh at how ridiculous it is.

Has Potential To Be Something,"I went into this open minded, and while I do think this movie establishes an interesting concept and has interesting plot points, it kind of disappointed me. I will say that it's not complete crap like some of the Hollywood films based on teen books are, so perhaps thats why I kind of want to go easy on it. It's good to see some effort being put into a film. Comparing this to say, The Hunger Games, perhaps is why I was left a little underwhelmed, because I think the first Hunger Games was not bad, and then Catching Fire ended up really impressing me. I kind of hope that since this film is the first in a series, the next will take what was interesting in this and bring it to the fore front. It certainly has potential to be a good series, but it's off to a slightly rocky start.One of the stronger aspects of this film is Shailene Woodleys performance. She is a really strong actor and the film benefits from putting someone with skill in the lead role as opposed to the usual ""pretty but terrible actress"" kind of girls they usually put in these kind of roles. The rest of the performances we're okay. No real stand outs but they work for the most part.The plot is another strength that works. It's about a society where young adults are sorted into different factions based on skills and it's a very stressful process. But what's great is that it is clearly a metaphor for the modern day process of pressuring young adults into university and making them make these big choices that affect the rest of their lives. I have always found issue in the way society does this ever since I started high school, and I think it's interesting to see that concept in this film. It kind of works, and I will give it credit for handling a subject that can be quite relate-able for many young people today.Overall, the films strengths come from it's concepts and it's potential to improve in future sequels. As a person who likes film in general, I will always be positive about movies and I do hope they can smooth out the next film and make it something great. I would be really happy to see the sequel be something great, similar to how Catching Fire improved on The Hunger Games dramatically.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Better than I expected,"Im coming from the perspective of not having read the books, although considering reading them now. I was quite impressed with this movie! Im surprised actually. I've recently watched Vampire Academy which is probably the most shameful and horrific adaptation of a damn good book I have ever seen. Anyway, so I wasn't holding up much hope for this film. But instead I come out of surprised and having enjoyed my experience in the Divergent world. Obviously in the books you get a deeper back story and deeper insight into their lives, so I understand that in the film there is going to be some lacking of both, it's pretty understandable as you cant get everything in. The acting was great, I saw a few familiar faces in Shailene and Theo, as well as a fellow TFIOS actor Ansel. The main cast were fantastic. I'd never seen Shailene before and wow she blew me away, she was great. Its not as testing as her role in TFIOS for obvious reasons but perhaps it test her in different ways (physically). She was pretty badass in this. As for Theo I've seen him in a few others and I think in this he really impressed me, as he did in A Passionate Woman. A lot of people are saying he's not right for the role but seeing as I haven't read the books I have no idea what he was meant to be like, so I'm reviewing his performance in this rather than in comparison to how he should be. Emotion wise this film built up to that and it was emotional at times. I liked that they didn't focus too much on the relationship (come on guys it's pretty obvious it was gonna happen). I have a few downsides however. The CG wasn't very good, not realistic enough. I felt like I was in a game like Beyond Two Souls or The Last of Us. It wasn't very real, you could tell it was CG. In the beginning with all the people walking into the city was just ridiculously bad, like I was playing Sims 3. And the other issue I had was with the story line, which isn't the fault of the movie writers but of the author. I saw too many obvious similarities to books like The Hunger Games and The Vampire Academy. I'll giver her this, it's difficult to be original nowadays but there were some things so obviously the same as stories before hers. But other than that, fantastic film and worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great start,Divergent is the great start of this trilogy. The movie contains many details from the book but not at all. It need to contains some more details such as the train. I think Theo James needs to work more on some acting. I like the organization on film. There is not too much romantic path and not too much action. It is great for people who don't like much bloody actions. Many people compare this with The Hunger Games.But this movie is different.I am the one who read the book before and I think the movie make my imagination real.The movies make me excited even I has known the end. I wish this trilogy will be success.This is good for anyone to see. I can't wait for the Insurgent.,8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
How on earth is this rated so highly?,"Granted, I watched this on an International Flight, and was not in a good mood, but this was seriously one of the worst movies that I've seen in a long time. From the first seconds, it is obviously trying to be some kind of new Hunger Games franchise. It is incredibly stupid, boring, and utterly predictable at every SINGLE turn. I have no idea why anyone would rate this above a 5, even if they had never seen a movie before in their entire lives.I've seen THOUSANDS of movies, and remember not one single redeemable moment of this piece of garbage.

Excellent movie,"One of the best movies and most under-rated movie. This movie is surely going to be big hit in future. I am sure sequels and series are going to be excellent.This series surely going to rock. Shailene Woodley was just amazing. Done total justice to her character. Theo James also did well in the movie. A Sci Fi movie which one should watch with turn,twists,struggles,emotions,help,action and many more things. In fact each character has done justice to the role.

Horrible movie,"I didn't expect much but this movie still managed to underwhelm me. It doesn't contain a single original idea... None at all. Totally boring, predictable, dumb, and even the basic premise of the story is unconvincing to start with. This system with the 5 castes would not ensure any greater stability for society than the system we currently have. Even on a theoretical level, it would solve no problems and there is no logic behind it. They want people to rigidly adhere to a one-dimensional category (I'm smart, I'm considerate, I'm fierce, I'm honest, etc.) and they even assign castes for them but then they allow people to choose? You can't have democracy and dictatorship at once, you can't raise sheep but also urge them to have self-determination. So even the basic concept of the story is flawed, and no matter how good your structure is, if it isn't built on a good solid foundation, the whole thing will crumble. Take a look at the society in Brave New World, now that's hard to challenge, it's actually a very solid system even if it repulses us as we read.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Different - but just as good as Hunger Games !,"My 11-year-old daughter had read the book Divergent and so of course dragged me off to see the movie opening weekend. We both absolutely loved the movie. The movie Divergent is action-packed with very likable characters. I found the movie kept my attention from beginning to end, with some light moments, a bit of romance, and lots of excitement throughout. I'm a big Hunger Games fan and thought Divergent was every bit as good, and in some ways better.Based on our advice, my wife and 9-year old son went to see Divergent this weekend and both loved the movie equally as much. We can't wait for the sequel next year.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An Excellent Movie for an Excellent Book,"In my opinion, Divergent was fantastic and a must see-movie. Divergent is the most pure and honest movie based on a book I have ever seen. It does not remove almost any important scenes from the book and yet it still stitches the whole thing together to fit perfectly, and beautifully. It does this so well, that companions who haven't read the book still understand everything. It also made my friends want to read it; and though some of them did not want to start from the first book since they saw the movie, they started from the second and have not encountered parts which they did not understand. This is because the movie is so well made that they did not leave out anything in production, like most big production companies do. Divergent has action, adventure, romance, comedy, mystery, etc. It is the perfect movie to me. The actors are fantastic, and Shailene Woodley and Theo James rock the roles of Tris and Four in perfect unison. Divergent brings fans wildest imaginations to life, and flies the words of the book of it's pages.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Book was much better,"If you haven't read the book you may think the movie was very good, but if you have read the book, you will have realized that the book was MUCH better and many things that will be important later on in the series were not even mentioned. I think this will be a problem later on in the movies. But other wise the movie was pretty good and I understand that the book can't be exactly like the book but if it is important later on in the series you need to put it in the movie. I recommend the movie to you if you didn't read the book, or if you don't care if the book and the movie aren't exactly alike, but if you are a stickler about things like that I don't recommend the movie to you.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Where do I belong? I hope not in this movie.,"In my humble opinion this movie is so far the biggest mistake I've seen in 2014, with movie I Frankenstain. I was scandalized by it's relatively high rating on IMDb, almost 7.1, which is in my opinion too much. Totally uninteresting movie, thrown into the wind 2 hours of my time. Probably the best part of movie is its very beginning. The plot is terribly predictable, full of holes, illogical, with shallow characters. Just to mention I have a feeling that Miles Teller plays always the same character in all his movies. Not that I was expecting something from a movie, but then again ...

"This movie is enjoyable, but the structure of its own plot prevents Divergent from a worthy watch.","Divergent is based on the popular teen novel by Veronica Roth about a post-apocalyptic society where everyone is divided into factions based on what trait the have, be it bravery, kindness, selflessness, etc. I have read the book and I will be honest; I was not a huge fan of it. I thought it was good, but there was some things wrong with the story that I couldn't look past. But we aren't here to talk about that, are we? I wasn't originally wanting to see Divergent, but my mom wanted to, so I decided to watch it. After watching the movie, I can safely say that it's alright. I'm going to start this review with what I liked about the movie. First off, the acting. I thought everyone in this movie did a good job. Shailene Woodley did a good job as Tris, Kate Winslet did a good job as Jeanine, Theo James surprised me with his performance as Four. In my opinion, the person who stole the show was Jai Courtney as Eric. He did a fantastic job being a menace. I also thought the action was cool. It was fast paced, intense, and had guns. Lots and lots of guns. The only thing I didn't like about the action was that it took so long to get there. All the action-y stuff happened with about 20 minutes left in the movie. Not that it was a necessarily bad thing. Seeing all the initiates go through training was pretty cool. This movie, as well as the book, just has an interesting premise. An entire world that's divided into colonies defined by their attributes is just cool. It may be borrowing a little too much from The Hunger Games, but I don't mind. Now I must talk about what I didn't like. First is, actually, the romantic relationship between Tris and Four. I know! Criticize me all you want, but it's my opinion! I felt like their romantic relationship felt unnecessary and almost out of place. This was, in fact, one of my biggest complaints about the book. Look, I think romance in movies and books are just fine. In some cases, they're actually done very well. This one just didn't click with me. Another complaint was that this movie seriously lacked tension until the last 20 minutes or so. Characters get into the life threatening situations, but for most of the time, I didn't feel tense or worried at all. I will admit is that part of it is because I read the book, but that doesn't really matter. The movie is pretty predictable and you can expect what's going to happen next and how they will get out of the situation. You may feel tense in these moments, but I didn't have that feeling, which kind of bummed me out. While I didn't love the book, one of the things I enjoyed was that it had really tense moments. The movie seemed to butcher those moments, in my eyes. The movie's biggest problem is how it handles the source material. Don't get me wrong, it follows the book pretty well. It's how the movie uses the source material that is the fault. This movie zips by important plot points way too fast, leaving you with a ""wait, what?"" or a ""well that just happened"" mentality. It goes too fast for you to actually care about what's at stake. I may have a lot to criticize, but Divergent is still a decently enjoyable movie. It's worth a watch, but I wouldn't go full price. See if you can go on a matinée or rent the movie off of RedBox. It is not as good as the book, but the movie is good enough to get some enjoyment. And I hope Shailene Woodley goes far in her acting career. She is very good and I have a feeling you will be seeing more of her very soon.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
People live in a futuristic world in which society is divided into five factions.,"Divergent is a mystery/science fiction film that is jam-packed with action. I think that the message that the film is giving off is that if you try your hardest, you will succeed, this is due to the character Beatrice/Tris. I enjoyed this film as it was interesting and dramatic. My favourite part of the film was the ending when Tris and Four conquered the system and saved thousands of innocent people's lives. I would recommend this film to people who like film with action (fighting) but also romance. If I were to give this an age rating I would give it a 12+ due to the amount of use of guns and violence. I enjoyed the chemistry between the actors Shailene Woodley and Theo James.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good-almost-great adaptation, OK-almost-just-almost-good movie","As an adaptation this movie had both amazingly perfect transitions and horrible mistakes, no wonder reviews are so conflicted about it.I will go through 1) characters 2) events of the movie to try to explain the best where there was excellence and where was a giant mess.1) Characters.Four/Tobias - in the book is the very composed, strong, collected character that has dramatic emotional past which crafted the man he has become - a man who hates being weak so much he will torture himself by facing his own fears every day for the rest of his life not leaving a trace of weakness inside him and keeping himself in check, a man who won't lose his composure ( poetically speaking and literally ). However, do not confuse him with a cold-hearted man that just learned not to care, he has a heart that can warm you up in the coldest situations, if that's what you really need, cause most of the time he will give you tough love. So, not the easiest character to bring to life, to say the least. Unfortunately I cannot say that the movie has done a well enough job at introducing us to this character or making his story have as strong of an impact on the viewer as it had on the reader, as a viewer you probably won't feel the admiration or respect that character really had. However, as someone already 'knowing' what he was like, I'll have to say that, to my greatest joy, Theo James has done unbelievable job making Four as fearless and lovely as he was in the book. If anything, the only difference would be that Four in the movie was less vulnerable, less shaky, more solid and profound than you'd remember him in the book. That change of course took some color of his book-character away, but, to be honest, that color was not fitting him to begin with. Reading the book I always had trouble putting Four-still-a-huge-mess-inside and Four-does-not-even-flinch-meeting-his-biggest-fear together. This way, more believable.Tris - good! Don't have much to say about her. She is easy to picture for the Tris of the book, she could put together being inexperienced but brave, innocent but not a victim, genuinely scared but smart teenager.Jeanine - perfection! In my head, Jeanine was one of those people that you just wanna attack physically she was so unbearably senseless in her own ideas. Like you cannot believe her! In the movie Jeanine was a total perfection. She pulled off the Erudite soul so well that I can describe that faction with just her character - her detachment, her weird evilness as if 'I really do mean good to the world'. Even small details like when she is physically approached how it surprises her, how unfamiliar she was to any type of power other than the intelligence. Bravo.Peter - Now, this is why the movie was boring. You see, the most thrilling part of the story is supposed to be the transition of Tris- Abnegation to Tris-Dauntless, and you know why? Because Peter, the real Peter of this story, made it hell and nightmare for Tris to spend a night in the Dauntless compound. He was not a jerk or a dick or an asshole, he was a psychopath, got it? He wasn't making jokes that made you wanna joke back, he made jokes that made you shiver inside and barely hold your composure. I am fine with certain scenes not being there to make it PG-13, but making a real threatening character instead of, actually, very lovely one, would be much appreciated, thank you!Other characters were well enough or not too much important to go detailed about. Christina was so well cast it's scary ( I actually visioned exactly her features / appearance ), Al - good, just a bit abrupt, Will - yeah but was I supposed to care for him? Molly - are you kidding me.. She is not bad at all, I felt pity for her.2) EventsWhen Tris jumps - that scene - is important for her character building. She does not just jump cause she likes to try, she jumps to show to Peter ( who managed to intimidate her already at that point ) and all his dauntless 'hunters' that she is not a victim. That is her first step from selfless to self preserving. She tosses her jacket on him and jumps! That is a much better scene, why change that to whatever, it's not like it would last any longer than it did.Christina hanging over the pit scene. Overall, OK. But with the timer it would be something! Without it first Eric feels less of a douche cause you already do expect him to pick her up right before she falls, second, it's less scary. With the timer Christina has only herself to save herself, and you really don't know if she will be able to, cause it's no miracles zone.Stabbing Edward in the eye. Well, not much to say about this scene cause it wasn't freaking there! Errgh.Well, as you can see, good points outnumber bad ones, overall quite a good adaptation, but not exactly great, cause the few bad ones were really really off. I am not a detailed reader or watcher, things that stand out to me are probably out there for everyone. I am angry a lot on things like Peter not having anywhere near the vibe from the book, but at the same time genuinely glad for so many others ( Four, Tris, Jeanine, Christine ) being so correctly done. For a reader that's a great pleasure.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This is a Great Movie!,"This is a Great Movie! A very well-acted well written script. I've never read the book, but the story was very easy to follow and very engaging. I just let the story come to me, let it set it's own pace and wow awesome! I really loved it! Great twists, good action, heroic moments, excellent drama, romance and heart. I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS FILM. I lied it just as much as Hunger games, maybe even a little better. It seemed more realistic and sincere. It is not as scientifically sophisticated as movies like Gattaca or Artificial Intelligence. And it's not as large scale as LOTR or Ben Hur. But it a really good flick.

Divergent or Deviant?,"I usually judge how engaging a movie is by how many times I look at my watch while it is playing. For Divergent, it was four. (Four! Really!) It's not boring, exactly. It's justmeh. Despite the exciting music, high-value production and characters that pant and strain and STARE intensely, there just isn't much to go on here. The book was better because it had WORDS, and Veronica Roth is a pretty good writer (unlike certain other dystopian blockbuster authors I could think of). The movie exposes the story's basic weaknesses: a paper-thin premise and too few interesting characters (when one dies I can't even remember which one it was.) Moreover, we've seen this storyline so often before that we can practically write it ourselves. But Divergent delivers in some important areas: A-list actors, a kick-ass teen male hero (with beautiful tattoos!), some pretty cool action sequences, a great soundtrack, and Shailene Woodley, one of the few young actresses who really can carry a movie by herself. Four, of course, is practically perfect in every way: teen boys, if you want to know what girls want, GO SEE THIS MOVIE. Just grow muscles, have an old-fashioned sense of honor, be protective but don't be a chauvinist, be good at EVERYTHING but also have a deep psychological wound that a girl can help you overcome.

Applause all around,"Movie was fantastic. I've read all three books, and they tried to stay as true to the book as possible, although there were a few big differences the message still came across in the same fashion. The characters seemed very accurate and the clothing selection was up to par with the description in the book.There was constant nonstop action that kept my friends and I squirming in our seats. The one suggestion I have is to not see it with friends who talk or hit you anytime something exciting occurs (which is the entire film)At the first showing last night everyone in the theater applauded at the very end of the film.

Testing times,"Twilight found a teen female audience. The Hunger Games found a teen female audience. They also sold a shed-load of books.Now its the turn of Divergent but this film fails. Like The Hunger Games this is a future dystopian society but this one has ever running trains that never stop at train stations. It certainly gives the phrase 'a running jump' new meaning. Even a bit of Ender's Game is thrown in here.In a Chicago which is now a massively walled city after a devastating war, society is divided into five factions: Abnegation the selfless, Amity the peaceful, Candor the honest, Dauntless the brave, and Erudite the intelligent. However there is sixth group that are the faction- less who are outside society and regarded as outcasts. No one seem to questions the role of these outsiders who are left destitute.Members join a faction based on their choice but are given a suggestion by an aptitude test. Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) has grown up in Abnegation, the faction that runs the government, yet has always been fascinated by Dauntless. Her father serves on the ruling council along with the head of Abnegation, Marcus Eaton (Ray Stevenson).Each year when kids turn 16 they go through a serum based aptitude test that indicates the faction into which they would best fit. Beatrice test shows attributes of several factions meaning she is Divergent. She is told to keep this a secret as Divergents can think independently and the government therefore cannot control them. During her choosing ceremony she becomes a Dauntless.So like The Hunger Games we are told that the ruling government has magically found peace after a devastating war and everyone in society is happy apart from the faction-less. We see people happily working the land, some helping each other and the protectors running and climbing things. It certainly looks like Prozac Nation.Beatrice suddenly joins other Dauntless teenagers running and jumping in and out of trains and soon becomes a super soldier. Yet she does not realise that her training superiors are less comrade in arms and are actually horrid and mean, changing the rulebook. People who fail various stages of training become faction-less and this does not ring any alarm bells that society is not what its cracked up to be.However there is plot afoot for Erudite leader (Kate Winslet, unrecognisable in a blonde wig) to get rid of other Divergents and take over the government by getting rid of Eaton.Apart from a silly plot that is full of holes, the acting is rather weak, the characters have no charisma and the film is dull, looks cheap, overlong which makes it drag even more.Twilight had a romantic sub plot that sucked viewers in as well as dealing with issues of teens in a new town. The Hunger Games had Jennifer Lawrence, a genuine star in the making as well as the survival concept. This film has very little to offer apart from mixed messages. You soon forget which group is who and of course any viewer will realise that humans simply cannot be compartmentalised so easily as they do in this film, we all have certain mixed attributes. Therefore we are all faction-less.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Amazing,"So I watched this movie for what feels like the millionth time today. I love it so much! I have seen reviews talking about 'poor writing' 'poor directing' 'poor casting' and 'poor acting'. The people writing this review seriously need to get over themselves because they probably can't even act. I'd like to see them get handed the million-page script of Divergent and THEY can attempt to perform it even better. I highly doubt they will top the amazing acting done by Theo James and Shailene Woodley, in particular. Also, in saying that, I have seen another review stating that she couldn't tell Will, Al and Peter apart. Cleare;y, YOU weren't paying attention at the beginning of the movie, when they introduced themselves. They were sitting at the table, eating lunch (I assume) and they were arguing over their factions. Peter is played by Miles Teller, and again, it clearly states in the movie who he is. It is during the fight scene, the day after the knife scene, when Eric states: ""Peter and Tris in the ring"". (something along those lines) These people who are talking about poor directing etc need to pay more attention the movie, and I highly recommend READING THE BOOKS BEFORE YOU SEE THE MOVIE!! It will help you understand the movie if you don't normally PAY ATTENTION TO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's not rocket science people! In saying that, I read another review talking about "" Having destroyed civilization in a world war, the city survives. The survivors had enough materials to build a massive wall around the city, 300ft high, but can barely feed themselves. Now they have split into 5 factions (actually 6 because they throw a lot of people out and call them 'factionless') and this somehow magically creates peace"" It is a fiction movie okay?!?!! It's not real! So don't be so critical about it! Honestly some people need to go back to 5th Grade! IT. IS. NOT. REAL. And don't bother watching Twilight or Hunger Games, just because it's ""slightly better"". Go watch them because they are all (including Divergent) top quality movies and entertaining for millions of people. Divergent was a great movie, but some people really need to put some more thought into their reviews. Thanks to Shai and Theo for inspiring me to begin acting too.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I Liked It!,"Goodness! Many of the other User Comments for this film seem unjustly brutal. I confess I would probably not be considered part of the usual demographic for this type of movie, being more than half way to my 'three score years and ten'. Perhaps it is because of this I was able to just sit back and enjoy this movie for what it is - solid escapist entertainment with a bit of romance thrown in for good measure. When our real world currently appears to be going to hell in a hand-basket, what on earth is wrong with a healthy dollop of romance and escapism? Some have accused the film of being totally far-fetched - but isn't that rather the point of a futuristic fantasy film? Again, futuristic/fantasy/ sci-fi films are not usually to my taste and I try to avoid anything with wizards and/or dragons at all costs - not my bag at all.I thought that Theo James as Four and Shailene Woodley as Tris had wonderful chemistry. It was also very good to know that the amorous Mr. Pamuk from Downton Abbey lived to fight another day after all!

Is this what has become of writing?,"The thoughts going through my head during the majority of this movie was: ""Has this really been published as a book?"" and ""This seems like something I could write"". And I just don't tell myself that, it actually seems vaguely similar to something I wrote years ago on an exam.Welcome to a world where all the guys look strangely familiar and have forgettable names. Apparently there has been some sort of war that almost wiped out humanity. A small part of the population has however managed to seal Chicago off. The founding fathers of this society has clearly been reading up on dystopia and has come to a conclusion that Hunger Games is the way to go. Only smaller. This is all acted out where plot holes are blatantly overlooked and the identity of a character really isn't that big a deal.Suffering from a lot of vibes similar to that of the vastly inferior first Hunger Games movie. One can see a movie going for the same social commentary void of the core originality. The originality was also lacking, although not to the same degree, in the aforementioned film.This obviously isn't to much of a problem seeing as how it's really not THAT similar in the way the movie gets the message across, but there are very similar traits to this film and you can draw some lines that would be hard to credit for being original. As I haven't read the book i can't say if that's something to blame on the author of the book or the writers working on the screenplay. To me it seems like whoever was in charge of what was going on towards the end of the film got a bit sick of working on this.There are scenes in this movie where you may find the dialogue laughable or spine-tingling and cringeworhty. This goes for the story as well, when you're not able to tell where this movie is headed it takes a turn for the worse. However, don't worry, the guy next to me proved that predicting this movie from start to end isn't really an achievement.I'm not gonna say that the acting was terrible, but it had it's definitive weak moments. Towards the end, and I don't think this will surprise anyone, there is a crying scene. It may actually be one of the most annoying moments I've ever seen on the silver screen or on any screen for that matter.I could go on pointing everything that is wrong with this movie, but i won't. There are redeeming factors to this movie. I think the cinematography has some shining moments, maybe with a bitter aftertaste of pretentiousness. Anyone familiar with the musical works of Woodkid will know that his music has cinematic traits as a result of several years behind the camera, which I personally think is great. It really goes along well with this trendy and ""not-so-dark-dystopian"" world.Ultimately it seems like a mix of Equilibrium and, as i already have mentioned to the point where it becomes boring(much like the message of this movie) The Hunger Games. You take the mush, cover it in 100$ bills, add a relatable teenage identity crisis, some predictable romance and overthrowing of a government and you have yourself a hit, at least among the younger generation.Clearly though they haven't gotten it all wrong. My younger sister at the age of 16, seemed to think much better of this film. Hmmm... Go figure.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Another random entertainment,"This goes for the other two movies as well. I haven't read the books, so I wouldn't know if the books contained any substance.It's stuff like this that made me become uninterested into dystopian genre - such an accumulation of recycled ideas. The idea of science fiction eroded to the level of video game aesthetics - how far this erosion will go? How far will they go with black and blue suits, shinny metallic interiors, simulation within simulation narrative, ah we want to overthrow the powerful and everything is deserted, but we are cool and sexy, no matter our acting is getting worse and worse.

Divergent,"I thought it was a really good depiction of the book! The director left some things out, but it's to be expected since you can't possibly fit everything from a book into a one hour & thirty minute movie. However, the movie covered most of the important parts which is great to know. Some of the parts left out are also included the deleted scenes due to timing issues. There are some movies based on books that are absolutely terrible, but I thought that this wasn't the case in Divergent. This is one of my favorite movies currently.

And why am I watching this? How long it will be? Whan this torture will finish? And my companion and I were trying to figure out through whole movie one question: Why?And much more. What war? Who is the bad lady? Who they are fighting with? And much more.Viewer is left alone with senseless images, which are esthetically nice, but repeating few times. Why I have to see the head of main actress 20 times from around? Twice is enough. It seems, that director had nice camera and love to play with it, but it is just a holes filler - time consumer.Music is so bad, that I wanted to wear headphones with own stuff, completely tasteless - typical Hollywood pompous style. At last there was no symphonic orchestra like on most of films..Actors just running around, lines are corny, the idea is missing. Half of the film is dark, and impossible to watch. I didn't read a book, and I will probably never do, because of this film - seems swallow like a drop of water, with sentences containing three words in average.If You are less than 11 years old, this film is good for you, but I was watching better things that age..",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Divergent - a movie with many confusions,"I appreciate your idea of dividing the world into five factions: Abnegation, Erudite, Dauntless, Amity, and Candor. But you didn't state clearly why the world is broken in that way? War is not enough. In Chicago but don't know when it is, why it is??? @@ All sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives after taking an 'aptitude' (placement) test. But no orientation, no tutorial. Just follow what they have seen in other factions which are all beyond their imagination. Factions before blood, so every teenager just puts aside their origin, their parents, follow some guys but don't know who they are @@ Dauntless people could kill even their parents. Too ridiculous. Being divergent is also very easy, just think that ""This is not real"" to overcome fear. Otherwise, dauntless ones always fight back to the fear. I fear the world when everybody always want to inject sth into your necks and tests you all the time. It's also superficial to prove that Tris is divergent by testing results. There are so many people used that way to overcome fears,... T___T Many scenes of chases are also unreasonable when so many guards couldn't stop just 2 or 5 people. I also doubt of the invalidation of new drug on Four.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Twilight meets Hunger Games,"Divergent is valid movie it own genre. Maybe even better than Hunger Games. Divergent thou have same problems than many other movies at the same genre. To maximize the profit movie violent must keep mild. If they would go to PG-15 instead of PG-13 they might get more depth to the movie. Also it might get more adult audience to watch it. Now this feels like Twilight meets Hunger Games. Story itself is quite fascinating, but it is too dragging. When something finally starts to happening movie comes to its end and you have to wait for sequel at least a year. Maybe two movies instead of three might work better. But the studios won't think viewers as much as they think profit. The problem here is that the second movie will be just a middle story to tell and you have to wait the third movie to see how the story will end. Chemistry between Tris and Four be conspicuously absent, but luckily Four is worth to watch; ) This movie is little bit better than average on its genre, but it might work better in 3D format.http://tinovalkki.blogaaja.fi/",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It was poor.,"My review may have a spoiler, although I have no intentions for that to occur, read at your own risk I suppose. I'm a big fan of sci-fi films and from the trailer and the hype, the film was set out to be something incredibly cool nonetheless, but in practice, it really didn't pan out upon watching it, my main concern was the emotional moments, they were rushed and happened to soon between one another we wasn't given enough time to connect with the main character, it was too sudden and it had no emotional effect. The concept was a good idea, but the acting was especially poor when they were pretending to be vacant, it didn't look good. Basic acting like the moment she woke up, the person she wakes up to immediately walks in as if he knows she will wake up, and she sits up- right immediately, who even does that, come on... I'm disappointed overall without a doubt I expected more but alike the existing ratings it isn't getting a good score from me.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"I really thought about bypassing this one, GLAD I DIDN'T!","I really enjoyed this one. I heard a lot of negative things about the novels and about the film itself. From what I had seen, it was one of those films that I didn't mind if I didn't get to see it right away. But my sister asked me to go see it so I did. Surprisingly I really liked this one. Coming from someone who didn't read the book and wasn't really wanting the see the movie, it's really not as bad as people say. I managed to sit through it for two hours and enjoy the whole thing. I also don't like how people bash things and fans of things just because they didn't like it and with people nowadays that's exactly what I've seen from reactions to this series. To the point where people were calling people that liked it ""stupid"", really let's grow up now. As for the film it's not a bad story, I actually enjoyed the plot and they seemed to explain the story well for a novel-to-film translation. They characters weren't nearly as poorly conceived as I thought they would be and the acting was actually good. The cinematography was great as well. The ending was OK, but it didn't feel as though it left any room for a sequel, at least I couldn't tell that there would be another just by the ending to the film itself. I'm actually hoping that this series gets the other two translated onto the big screen as well. I think I might be a fan of these now.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sci-fi breakthru wannabe,"""Divergent"" strains to be the next Blade Runner or Matrix. You can see where they tried to throw in all the de rigueur elements: There's a social status quo that people accept and within which they operate. This is a little like the Matrix, except that there's (spoiler) the sense, by the story's end, that the social system in Divergent fails not because it's a systemic horror-show illusion (a la Matrix), but because the checks and balances fail; so Divergent doesn't *really* go for broke in that sense.There's a VO backstory involving a war and the city of Chicago being surrounded by an odd sort of ""wall"". This comes off like a quaint throwback to Blade Runner, with it's backdrop social reality of off- planet white flight. The difference is that Blade Runner's social backdrop feels strangely warm and contiguous with our reality, whereas Divergent's feels contrived for the express purpose of explaining how the ""new"" Chicago's progenitors got pushed to contrive the faction system. Frankly, I prefer a backdrop that looks like a version of ""home""; and that shouldn't just be another contrivance to ""explain"" things.I think the flick was supposed to be an extended parable on the importance of mutation for survival. But, in the end, I wasn't convinced that it sheds light on this; it veered too far into future dystopia action hero fantasy shoot-'em-up territory. We're supposed to understand that the heroine transcends her faction. In the end, it just sorta looks like she simply lucks into the position of getting the big picture and then using her faction-developed skills to blast through and stop the malefactors.There's a lot of stuff in the flick that doesn't seem to gel. There's an interpersonal antagonism within the heroine's caste that seems more designed to generate dramatic tension than it does to demonstrate caste- functional social behaviors; in other words, from time to time, writing for character just doesn't compute. In the end (spoiler) there's a deus ex machina moment where we're to believe a drug-programmed person is induced to snap out of it at the point where the heroine just-so-happens to need his aid to extricate her from yet-another brush with death, so she can go on to save the day.What's good about the flick? The actors were marvelously professional, and took direction exceedingly well. Set work, effects, stunts, shots, editing, and scene-by-scene dramatic flow was managed well, in a general sense. Production work was fully what one would expect from a contemporary sci-fi action flick. Hollywood has honed that stuff down to a razor sharpness which is always a marvel to behold; and might even see you through the viewing with nary a thought to leaving the theater or ejecting the medium from your video box.But if you're hoping to see the next mindblower sci-fi wunderkind, abandon hope.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Pretty Good Sci-Fi Story,"The war is over and now when one becomes 16-yrs of age, one must make a decision as to which group to belong to: Abnegation (selfless), Amity (peaceful), Candor (honest), Dauntless (brave) and Erudite (intelligent). These Factions, as they are called, are designed to maintain peace so war won't happen again. Tris (Shailene Woodley) leans toward Dauntless, but she really doesn't fit in there. She is Divergent (free thinker, non conformist) and Divergents are considered dangerous and may be put to death. This can't be good.I believe we have found another Katniss as Tris (Shailene) reminds us of another HUNGER GAMES kind of thing. I will admit that in the beginning when they showed Tris, I saw Katniss. See? There are some differences: no bows and arrows, no killing of children. The children in here undergo intense initiation training that can kill them if they are not careful enough.But, make no mistake about it, this is still a dictatorship under the guise of peaceful Factions. Their mantra is Faction before Blood. The real culprit that this dictatorship wants to control and eliminate is: The Human Condition. Can you believe that? Who makes this stuff up? (dictators is the answer)As we looked to Katniss to affect change, we now look to Tris to do the same. But, this won't be easy. She doesn't have a bow and arrows. Oh, oh How can she do this?Most of the movie shows the training of Dauntless hopefuls and some of it is hard to watch. This training focuses on individual fears and how the candidates perform when confronted with his/her greatest fear.In time we get to see a love story, sort of, and hope for the best, of course. We watch Tris try to qualify and not be dropped out of the program. But, to be fair, it's the love story angle that keeps us in our seats. We know it's there, however, that aspect takes a long time to crystallize, but we are a patient audience and believe we will be rewarded in time.The fight scenes and acting all around are very good. Besides Shailene as Tris another standout is Theo James as Four who comes across as a very strong character. There was a little joke in the beginning when Four announces his name and one of the candidates says to him, ""Four? Were 1, 2 and 3 already taken?"" We are told that the candidates are only to speak when spoken to. So right here we know the candidates will be in for a rough time of it.The rest of the cast performed well and Ashley Judd as Tris' mother, Natalie, does a credible job.Seems most of the candidates have to have tattoos and we can only hope they are washable.Over all a pretty good Sci-Fi story.The ending leads us to believe there will be a sequel or sequels. Can't wait, can you? (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Soft stuff and not much of it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Solid Dystopian Adventure,"""Divergent"" delivers an engaging dystopian story with a strong lead performance and well-crafted world-building. While it doesn't break new ground in the genre, it remains an entertaining watch, offering a mix of action, romance, and intrigue.Shailene Woodley carries the film with a compelling performance as Tris, making her journey of self-discovery and rebellion feel believable. Theo James as Four adds a strong presence, and their chemistry works well enough to make the romance subplot engaging without overwhelming the main storyline. The supporting cast, including Kate Winslet as the calculating antagonist, brings depth to the world, even if some characters feel underdeveloped.Visually, the film does a good job of bringing the faction-based society to life, with distinct aesthetics that make each group stand out. The action sequences are well-executed, particularly in the training segments, keeping the pacing relatively engaging. However, the plot follows a familiar formula, making it feel predictable at times, and some elements of the world-building could have been explored more deeply.Despite its flaws, ""Divergent"" remains an enjoyable entry in the young adult dystopian genre. It's not groundbreaking, but it has enough intrigue and strong performances to make it a worthwhile watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It was OK.,"I'm a fan of the series, and I must admit that I'm not that impress nor crazy over the outcome of the movie. I thought it was great how the movie tried to go by the book as much as possible, but I feel that it could've done WAY better.The casting of the movie was a little disappointing. Based upon the trailer, I thought Shailene seemed to be a great suit for Tris but after seeing the movie, I just don't feel that she does a good job being a ""dauntless"". I just don't buy all the strength and toughness that she attempted to portray throughout her training. I also don't like the casting of the rest of her dauntless pals. I expected Miles Teller as Peter to be more despicable because in the book Peter was someone who I truly despised.Other than that, I thought Ashley Judd and Kate Winslet were good for their part. I like seeing Kate Winslet as a villain for some reason. It's something different than what she normally does. Most importantly, I thought Theo James did a great job as Four. For me, his appearance and his acting was nearly close to how I envisioned Four while reading the books. Although Tris is the main character of the story, I feel that many of the audience will only stick around for Four as they continue on with the series.Last but not least, although it is a small thing, I did not like the narration in the beginning of the movie. The way that they tried to explain the different factions was too boring and plain. Perhaps they could've done something else to not only explain this main part of the story but to lure in the audience as well.Overall, I give this movie a 6 because it did follow the book. The action scenes were also quite enjoyable especially the ending.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Sometimes you wanted to see a bit more of the political backdrop going on while the main character is going through her personal journey. Unlike the Hunger Games Films (Of which I love those books - haven't read the 2nd and 3rd Divergent Books yet) thus far, with similar themes - the Movie doesn't peek into scenes beyond the Protagonist's prospective to add depth.

Paid Publicity and Paid Critics,"I usually don't write reviews and on occasion when the movie is really amazing or when movie is really worst, but that movie still end up with above 6 ratings by Critics. So Divergent is one of those movies where producers, directors and production houses instead of spending money and time on script, editing, acting and direction decided to spend all the energy on publicity and promotions. More than 90% of users reviews are negative and still the movie given as 7.7 stars I mean isn't is the biggest proof that producers well paid the critics too. Well, before the movie release they start promoting movie which is the typical case of every big budget movies but they started promoting actress and actor of the movie in every magazine and newspapers, basically they wanted to create a reel life imitating real life scenario between the leading pair the way it happened with Twilight series and because of that, the Twilight series otherwise one of the worse Vampire/Ware-wolf series made lot of money they bank on Kristen and Robert Pattison love chemistry, so the production houses tried to bank on Shailene & Theo chemistry in real life, but it seems that Shailene is not only pretty but she is smart as well, she has lot of potential and she didn't play that game. SO many comments already written about the flaws in the movie I don't think I need to reiterate them here. Overall very disappointing movie in all departments. The only thing is Shailene Woodley and I believe she is promising but still she is no Jennifer Lawrence and I don't think Divergent would become Hunger Games series. Another bad thing about this movie is unlike Twilight series which has low stars ratings which is justified this movie got 7.7 stars rating is ridiculous.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I expected that this movie would be a really hard sci-fi movie (at least from the poster) but was extremely light at this part, the action was light too and it wasn't till almost the end of the movie where it was not so much.

If anything, it strikes me as odd that there is more romance in the novel, and less in this film. That is not how I believed Hollywood operated. I stand corrected.

OK to watch if nothing else is on ...,"I didn't read the books so I can't judge how close they stayed to the original material. However, as you usually recognize short comings in movies that work with an adopted screenplay - this is not one of them. The movie feels cohesive and the leaps it has to make to get everything into a 2 hour flick are well executed, with seamless transitions throughout the story. But the story feels extremely derivative and offers nothing new or thought provoking, which could be due to the shallow incorporation of the whole back-story. It's hard to imagine the circumstances that lead to such a society depicted in the movie and so the parallels to our own society or which path could lead to such a society are missing (not very well explained). Also the whole time, while watching, I kept running thru a list of other movies this one ""knocked off"". In the end, it's a Hunger Games meets Equilibrium with nuances of Ultraviolet and Aeon Flux - and considering the novel was published only 3 years ago, I reckon that the whole trilogy is not very original. The acting is pretty decent but the chemistry between the leads is lacking - James appears to be a good actor but should have never been cast alongside Woodley who is really good in that role - though, both put together is just awkward to watch and it's easier to find a better Four than Tris.Bottom line, don't expect much and watch it purely to pass 2 hours of your time - then this one isn't a bad choice.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Loved It!,"Divergent is thought provoking, psychological and an intense movie. I love the marketing behind the movie, where one can take a quiz to see which faction he or she would most likely represent.

It's amazing to me that those who elected to rate Divergent, compare it to ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Twilight"" trilogies.I understand and get it... for this appears what human nature does... Yet, I believe it would be wise to rate ""Divergent"" independently of it's own cast, plot, content and adaptation. What is the point of comparing similar movies? To rip it to shreds? To manipulate or sway the readers opinion to your own?Just as it isn't really fare to compare a new relationship to a previous one because each person IS Different, and it doesn't give the new person (movie) the chance to hold its own. I don 't believe it's wise to do this when critiquing ""Divergent.""

Formulaic despite it's message of not conforming,"""I don't want to be just one thing. I can't be. I want to be brave, and I want to be selfless, intelligent, and honest and kind. Well, I'm still working on kind.""Let me start off by saying that I had no prior knowledge of Veronica Roth's novel which this film is based on so I can't make any claims on how faithful the adaptation is. Although I will say that 5 minutes into the film I kind of got a feeling that this futuristic dystopian story had some similarities to The Hunger Games which made me wonder if Divergent was not yet another one of Suzanne Collins' novel adaptations. The main reasons why this film was among my most anticipated films for 2014 were director Neil Burger, for his unique work in Limitless and The Illusionist, and Shailene Woodley who has been terrific in just about every film I've seen her in. So I was greatly disappointed when I discovered that Divergent, which had a heavy message aimed towards young adolescents about not being labeled or categorized and discovering who you really were by following your own path in life, was being a bit hypocritical in its approach considering it can easily be categorized as yet another generic and formulaic teen romantic adventure film full of clichés. This was far from Burger's previous films which I found unique, perhaps due to their indie approach. However having said all this, I still found Divergent entertaining enough to mildly recommend it thanks in most part to the Shailene Woodley's lead performance. I'm not Divergent's target audience, but I think adolescents and young teenagers will love this film and their expectation will be fulfilled. They are the only reason why the planned sequels will get to be made, but the truth of the matter is that this is a much lesser film than The Hunger Games and will easily be forgotten in time.Vanessa Taylor and Evan Daugherty adapted the screenplay from Roth's novel setting the story in a futuristic dystopian Chicago where people live confined inside wired walls. They are also divided into five factions based on their virtues. Their is Abnegation who represent the selfless, Dauntless the brave, Erudite the intelligent, Candor the honest, and Amity the peaceful. The Abnegation faction are the ones in charge of governing the city considering they are selfless and always put others first. They are merciful people. Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) and her brother, Caleb (Ansel Elgort) have been raised by their parents, Andrew (Tony Goldwyn) and Natalie (Ashely Judd), in this faction, but when they turn 16 they are free to choose the faction they feel they belong with. Before they decide they must take a test which basically tells them what faction they really belong to, but they are free to decide on their own. Everyone always fits into one faction, but if you make a wrong choice you could end up factionless (homeless). When Tris takes the test she discovers she's one of the few people who is divergent (meaning she has basically all the virtues from every faction), but she must keep it to herself because these people don't fit in to this dystopian society where being different is viewed as something dangerous. When the day comes for Tris and Caleb to make their decision she ends up choosing Dauntless, who are basically in charge of the security and enforcing order in the city. Knowing that faction comes before family she must bid them farewell, and her training with Dauntless begins. At first she doesn't fit in due to the extreme physical and intense psychological tests that their instructors, Four (Theo James) and Eric (Jai Courtney), make them go through. If she doesn't pass the initiation program she will be sent with the factionless, but at the same time if they discover she is divergent, she could be killed so the adventure begins (and of course the romance as well).I enjoyed the performance from the young actors in this film and I think Woodley had great chemistry with James. A lot of people had issues with his performance, but I thought he was very believable and pulled it off well. The cast elevate this film and make the film's extended running time worth the while. There are some beautiful scenes that work really well in Divergent, I loved the cinematography and the dream sequences were probably the highlight of the film. There was also a scene where Tris went down a canopy line through the destroyed buildings that looked pretty cool. The story is formulaic and has its flaws. It felt melodramatic towards the end and tries too hard to leave audiences hooked for the sequel. The first part of the film suffers for taking to long to set things up and introducing each character, but once we are with Tris in Dauntless as she goes through the initiation process the film picks up. The film also fails to engage the audience as to why the divergent are so dangerous to their society, but it all seems to rely on the message the film is trying to give to young teenagers. It is a metaphor playing on the fear of adolescents of finding their place in society and discovering who they really are. It wasn't the film I was hoping for, but I am feeling merciful today so I will give it a passing grade.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It stars Shailene Woodley as the divergent heroine and co-stars Theo James, Kate Winslet, Ashley Judd, Jai Courtney, Miles Teller, Zoë Kravitz, Tony Goldwyn and Maggie Q. It was directed by Neil Burger and written by Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor (based on the book by Veronica Roth). I enjoyed it quite a bit and found it to be one of the better youth book film adaptations ever made.The story is set sometime in the future, after a war which divides the remaining civilization into five different factions (that are supposed to represent a person's skills and virtues). There's amity (which are the people who are the most peaceful), abnegation (made up of the selfless), candor (the most honest), erudite (the most intelligent) and dauntless (the world's most brave and fearless). There comes a time when teenagers must make a choice to either stay in the faction they were raised in or pick another. First they take a test which tells them which faction they belong in. Beatrice Prior, who later goes by Tris (Woodley), fails the test and is known by what society calls 'divergent' (due to the fact that she doesn't belong in any faction). Divergent people are seen as a threat to society, since they don't conform, and are killed because of it. Tris joins dauntless and must survive a rigorous testing process, in order to be accepted there, while also keeping her divergent status a secret. At the same time she learns there's a plot by one faction to overthrow another.I really like the setup to this sci-fi tale; it's interesting, complex and very entertaining at the same time. Burger (who won't return for the two planned sequels) and the screenwriters did a great job of bringing this world to life on screen. It's intense and very emotional at times. One of my favorite parts of the film is the performances; I think Woodley is an amazing talent to watch out for and is very impressive as the lead here. Usually the male actors suck in these youth book adaptation flicks but the guys cast in this are actually able to hold their own with the awesome female cast. I thought James looked horrible in the previews but he's not bad in his role at all. I also think Jai Courtney is always interesting to watch and it's funny to see Miles Teller as Woodley's bitter rival (after last seeing those two as lovers in 'THE SPECTACULAR NOW', which was one of the best movies of last year). Winslet, Judd, Q and especially Woodley are all of course outstanding in the female roles and I thought the whole film was just really well put together. I especially liked the main message of the movie; that it's good to be different and an independent thinker (even if you're seen as a threat to the conformist way of life) because being unique is definitely something to look up to. It's great that 'THE HUNGER GAMES' has raised the bar so high for movies like this because now we get much better quality films because of it!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UY2UtXfI_w",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
absolutely horrid not worth the money,How on the face of this planet did this movie get 7.7 if you've ever read the book you will find the amount of changes that take place throughout the movie compared to the book is nearly unbelievable I almost got up and left the theater in the middle of the movie there was so much changed the only resemblance to the book was the most basic plot line. Did Veronica Roth not watch the movie before it was released because what the hell was that if I were her I would be embarrassed to claim that as the movie version of my book. I could screen write a better version. If you haven't read the book I would suggest that you go see it and tell me I'm wrong because you're just gonna say that anyway and talk about how much of a good movie it was and and how I couldn't do better and all this crap or you could be less of a mouth breather and actually read the book before seeing the movie and then not sit through the 2 hour 20 minute monstrosity.,1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Amazing!,"I loved this movie, and yes, I have read and loved the books as well. Yes, there was obviously some things omitted from book to movie but it was required to fit it into a movie without making it last 3 and 1/2 hours. Honestly, the movie was extremely close to the book minus switching around a few things and taking out a couple of characters. The movie was intense, captivating and electrifying. Even my friend, who has never read the books, loved the movie. She seemed to pick up things pretty quickly and I could visibly see her tensing up through out the movie!I think everyone involved did a fantastic job. While it may not be exactly the same as the book, and of course no movie is as good as the book, it was very compelling and I cannot wait to go watch it again!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not that bad,"Divergent is a dystopian sci fi film about a futuristic world.If you have seen Hunger games then you may note many similarities between them.But it is not as sharp as The hunger games.Story was good but was wasted.It explores the theme of authority,genus and exploring ourself.It indirectly also hints us about a catastrophic future where everything has been destroyed due to war.Our own world is going on the very same way so we should now stop fighting against each other and should work for peace.Still you love fighting then fight against terrorism to bring peace all over the globe. Many friends suggested me this movie by saying that it is completely different.I would like to inform them that its not new as many movies had been made before on the very same idea.The start of the film was slow and boring.The middle of the film was also slow but it was average.In the climax the movie picked its speed but the climax was too convlucted and unimaginative.The ending was left open for its sequel.If you are going to make a trilogy then you have to make the 1st movie a solid one so that the audience may become interested in but the movie was average at its best.The movie deals with a good topic but doesn't explore it in a very nice way.First half of the movie was too prosaic.Visuals were good and acting was average.It was so pleasant to watch Kate Winslet in such a role.She was simply awesome.If you are a kid of 15 then you might like it and if you are a fan of Battle royale and Hunger games then you might leave it.If you could indure its first half then you may watch it.

"I did expect more, but I think there's enough here to have a decent time with","Could've, and perhaps should've, been greater.'Divergent' does makes for a good watch, it has a lot of positive elements to it and features two strong leads. However, the dialogue and the way the characters act up until the third act is irritating, especially at the beginning as they introduce all those involved.Shailene Woodley is excellent in her role, she brings likeable qualities to Tris alongside a sense of strength. I also liked Theo James, who portrays Four. A few of the others, like Zoë Kravitz (Christina) and Miles Teller (Peter), are OK too. With that said, they are all let down by the aforementioned iffy dialogue.I rate the initial world building and all the different factions, though that's one of the (many) areas where I think this film could've been great - so much more can be done with that. More development into the enemies would've been nice too, namely with Kate Winslet's Jeanine. Better fitting music is another thing that was needed.I did expect more, but I think there's enough here to have a decent time with.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It more depends on the viewer's opinion.,"Well I'm not going to stay here and list all the good and bad things about the movie. Sure, it wasn't as good as the book but you can't compare the two.People usually complain how the movie is different from the book. How some scenes were cut short or not in the movie at all. However you must keep in mind that a book gives you an insight into the character. Into their thoughts, reasons, and knowledge. A book may contain countless pages of explanations. A movie, whereas, has to format the book into a two hour clip. Try and imitate the person's thoughts through expressions and actions. A two hour movie won't be able to include all the scenes from the book. The movie was actually pretty good and did include most of the important scenes for a 500 page book.Another complaint is that the characters in the movie don't ""fit the standards."" Well, I'm pretty sure that everybody who has read the book have imagined the character differently. However the producers can't pick the perfect actors that will be able to fit everybody's expectations. They pick the characters they think fit best and if the author agrees then why are you complaining? The author definitely knows how their character should look like.So, after saying all that, I personally think that the movie was great and that you should go and watch it before judging it based on the critical reviews of those who can't accept the fact that the movie couldn't fully match the book. As you watch it, keep in mind that even though the movie might not be up to your standards, it could have been a lot worse.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Is a well done movie even if it is far from perfect .,"Unlike the first Hunger Games this one managed to make me get emotionally involved . My major complain is that the other initiates are just invisible , no time was spent to develop those characters and their relationship with Tris. If the other books are made into movies this will be a problem because some of those people have important roles to play .I sow other people complain that there is no sense of urgency and that may make the movie a bore . I think that this is caused by the fact that they wanted to get a good rating so there is a lot less death, violence and injury in the movie then in the book . In the book kids fall jumping from the train and a boy is mutilated to get him out of the competition.I agree they could have done a better job showing the pressure the character has to endure but it wasn't boring. If she fails to be accepted in Dauntless she will be thrown out on the streets and on top of that her life is in danger since divergents are killed .",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"It was good, nice idea.","Went in without seeing the trailer, i thought it was a good movie. It was well directed, and the overall concept if different from so many other movies in the same genre. Although it's a good movie, i noticed in the beginning of the movie, that i was thinking it had a long start, but it surprised me later on, which weighed it out. I went to see it with a friend of mine, and it got a little too girly from the middle to the end, but anyways, the movie was good, but expected better, based on the hype. I also expected to see Maggie Q a bit more, i was surprised she only appeared in a couple of scenes, which kind of let me down, since i am a huge fan of Nikia.. lol.overall: 7 stars for directing, concept, visuals and acting.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Childish poor execution. waste of time & money,"This is my first review on IMDb and I am very much upset to watch this movie. The way they advertised the movie I thought its going to be something but in real its nothing but a poor try to adopt a very good book. I was wondering all the time what is the big deal of being a divergent than when I came to know there was only one question ""so What?"".Personally I am a big fan of Shailene Woodley, I have already listed her as one of my favourite diva but watching this movie I would say she got beauty but no talent. Her expression shows lack of seriousness. Still the 5 stars I gave this movie is only because of her.I am never gonna recommend anyone to go and watch this movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Surpassed My Expectations and Improved Upon the Book!,"Go see Divergent. See it if you have read the book or if you haven't. But especially if you've read the book. As a fan of the book I really loved it, and the friends I saw it with who hadn't read it also enjoyed it.I really feel that the Neil Burger directed film did Veronica Roth's book justice. It just felt authentic in bringing that story world to life, from actually being shot in Chicago, to many of the actors doing their own stunts, to the fact that it was perfectly cast. The changes they did make from the source material only improved upon some quibbles I had with Roth's characterization and plotting as a first time author, and made sense cinematically. Fans can also rest easy, because Roth was a producer, so she had a big hand in shaping this film.Shailene Woodley was a great Tris. She is a great actress capable of conveying a wide range of emotions, and she totally embodies the toughness but relatability that is Tris. As a heroine, I found that she's a very good feminist role model for girls. She holds her own the way a male lead in an action movie is expected to, and she defies gender stereotypes. Theo James is Four. He exudes masculinity, mystery, and fierceness. He and Shailene played opposite each other very well, and their chemistry was palpable.So if you're a fan of The Hunger Games, action movies, or the Divergent book series, definitely go to see Divergent in theaters. It's an action packed thrill ride filled with great performances!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Bad idea, OK movie","The Bad:The title of the movie reviewed 95% of the movie, really weren't any moment of suspense of intrigue. Movie plot flow along like accountant's ledger book. There were some good idea along the way but none ventured to any degree (ability to watch other's dream? outside the wall? That freaking awesome looking wall itself!?) . Movie doesn't setup a believable premise of why decision was made on fraction social structure, what's the benefit  etc. Would've been a different movie entirely if we are currently living in that kind of society, and looking back at ourselves, but this is too simple of concept to be entertaining. Movie introduced an element which it did not fully exploit, or exploit at all. What's outside the wall? Why they put the wall up in the first place. Kate Winslet character was negligible, it could've been a computer doing all of it and it wouldn't have made any difference!The Good: Acting was good, I wasn't sure about how the Shailene Woodley and Theo James would do in their role, but surprisingly good. It's like putting to super models in a movie and hope they can get their line right, but turned out to be what could be career breakout performance. Especially from Woodley, very memorable. (Although to the end, if felt like her character did a 180 degree turn into heartless bitch, watching her father died like that) Production Value was good, production design, color, music, sounds work well and add to the movie instead of taking it away. Chicago setting wasn't the best, since I am from Indiana, and I know what's outside of that wall – Gary.Summary I can't say I liked because the plot was just so bad that it's sad. Idea is soooooo generic and not well setup up at all. Without a believable premise, everything else was like a long Music Video. Acting was surprisingly good, Woodley is both beautiful and inspirational in most part of the movie, and James was plain but enough for this movie.I think is 6 out of 10 is pretty good for what this movie is, if someone else played the part of Triss, I might've given it a 2 or 3.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Weak and Predictable,"Straight out the gate I saw this as a huge waste of time, because the predictability level was through the roof. And as usual the fake forced love interest that does more against the plot than it does to assist it.Like the hunger games with I read before watching the first film. These are written for young teenage girls, and for them I would gather it will appeal. But for an older person with a long list of movies under their belt. I find them uninteresting and rather juvenile in their make-up.The only redeeming factor for either of these movies, would be the lack of gratuitous sex scenes between these underage characters. None-the-less it is still old and tiresome when these lazy AF writers and directors go down the same tired route of some stupid unnecessary love interest when trying to stay alive should be the focus of the film.So I will give this a more than generous 4 out of 10 and leave this to the young demographic to which it was made,",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good acting, more of a teenage movie","I would give it a 7. Shailene Woodley did a great job in this movie. The movie is aimed more toward young teenagers but definitely exciting to watch for everyone. There are some gaps in the movie, for example the fear examination where Shailene says ""This is not real"" every other dauntless knows that and could do it, which didn't make sense to me. The music is very catchy. The soundtracks used in the movie are very well picked and put in the right moments of the movie. Definitely didn't waste my time from watching it. The movie was long, but I didn't get bored at any moment. Overall: Great acting, good soundtracks, good story, and teenage movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
ehh??,"Okay sue me but i kinda liked it. I liked it like i enjoy fanfiction though. It doesn't really have this amazing plot line or trippy idealism like most distopias but that isn't necessarily what's wrong with it. The movie really relies on it's very well written love story (which is it's best quality) and almost neglecting character development besides the obvious main character arc. However much i enjoyed the thrilling romance i felt unchanged after watching it. The acting was good and so were most of the cgi scenes considering 2014. But all of this stays the same and even gets worse over the series as a whole. I love the love in these movies but am actually bored of the plot. Very very predictable. They heavily remind me of what the CW's the 100 tried desperately to be and what the hunger games never was (because it was way better). You can really tell they were ballin on a budget to.

"Slow, But Captivating","What would you do if you didn't truly fit in to any group in your society? What about if the group you choose you belong to does not include your family? What if you unraveled a secret plan that was created to destroy people just like you? This is exactly what Tris must go throughout the film Divergent. In a world where people are divided into factions based on human virtues, Tris Prior is forewarned she is Divergent and will never fit into any one of these factions. When she discovers a conspiracy by a faction leader to destroy all Divergents, Tris must learn to trust a complicated character, Four, and together they must stop this faction leader from destroying the Divergents before it's too late.Walking into my town's local movie theater to watch Divergent, I didn't know what to expect. Not having read the book, I was a little bit skeptical going in. Many people raved about the book, but watching the previews on television, I wasn't very impressed. I thought it was going to be one of those film adaptations that people generally weren't really satisfied with like Twilight. I was wrong. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the film. Maybe not having the book to compare it to helped with my enjoyment, but coming from my perspective, it was better than I expected it to be. The advancement of the film's plot may have started out a little slow and was a bit confusing for those of us who have not read the book, but by the end, I fortunately understood what was happening and where they were going from there.I was impressed with how the actors and actresses developed their characters throughout the film. They showed us, the audience, who these characters were and were able to portray their personalities while the plot of the film developed further. Going along with that, the plot took a little bit to get going and capture my interest. The entire time while watching the film, I was wondering when the 'divergent' part was going to come in, and it didn't truly show itself until close to the end. Having the book and film called Divergent, I was hoping for a little more insight into what being divergent meant.I've always been a big supporter of music in films and its importance and Divergent didn't let me down. I thought the music choices for this film were spot on. Each song supported the scene it was matched with perfectly. The music kept the general feel of the film moving forward despite the slow moving plot. It was a more modern type of film, so the use of ""new"" sounding music made the film more believable.Overall, I was pretty satisfied with the film. Of course there are things that I disliked about it, but that goes for anything. I was certainly pleased with the final product created by the collaboration of director Neil Burger, author Veronica Roth and screenplay writer Evan Daugherty. I am looking forward to see what the next two movies have to offer.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Movie was mediocre but enjoyable compared to book.,"Truly an excellent film, very interesting but I found it lacked essential parts in which the book had. Edward being a strong supporting character was completely cut from the movie, including his stabbing. Will and Al were like twins and I found it quite difficult to tell between the two. Tris was a very intriguing character, in the novels at least. In the movie I thought she was okay, her actress was mediocre at best. Ansgel Elsgort who played Caleb I found annoying at times. The age difference between Tris and Four (Tobias) was weird. 16 and 24 (movie) vs 16 and 18 (book). Overall it wasn't bad like most films the book was better.

I gotta say this: Divergent is not that bad,"Just watched this film and, as I usually do with all movies, hopped on to IMDb to see what other people thought. And BOY, was I surprised!All of these negative reviews are insane. I mean was the writing good? No. Was the acting Oscar- worthy? No. Was the premise rational? No.I thought the writing was entertaining, it used many old tricks. The tricks that made you feel like the movies were magic when you were a kid. The storytelling was well-paced, and felt much more like an adventure movie than an intellectual sci-fi.Speaking of which, I'm so underwhelmed by sci-fi films being all intellectual and sad and coldly existential. **** that ****! So what if the story itself wasn't particularly believable or filled with holes? At least the characters here have agency. At least they go out and rebel gloriously instead of spending two hours moping about, contemplating their incompetence and accepting the sad truth of reality. I mean what happened to the good old sci-fi fantasy flick anyways? People obviously love it, but is telling a fun adventure story full of holes suddenly not OK with the review hipsters anymore?The acting was credible. People who say Shailene Woodley cannot act are out of their minds, she did a great job and was absolutely adorable, especially considering the script. Sure, every character was played in a way that at times was pretty annoying. But it was clear to me that this was intentional– as in intentionally annoying you for emotional fuel. Again, I think all the actors played their roles well in the context of the adventure template. The leads, even if they could not play whole characters (because of the script), accomplished admirably what was needed to move the story forward.Which brings me to the premise. What makes a good sci-fi story worth our time? Is it a post- apocalyptic background setting where the zombies rose on Dec. 21 2015, spread by a rare virus strain incubated in the asses of mutated monkeys?

Solid movie without highs and lows,"First of all this is way better, than ""The Hunger Games"" which is in my opinion a childish B-movie at best.Both movies suppose to be for young adults and both have a very similar story, but Divergent did it way better.Many people complain about clichés and a predictable plot, but they don't realize, that this is a movie for young adults.When I was young I loved such stories and I didn't see their clichés, because I didn't KNOW that those are clichés.You have to read many books and watch many movies to recognize standard things as cliché.There is nothing wrong with clichés. They make up our entire life. We learn from them as young adults.I am a 45 years old male and I enjoyed this movie as I would have enjoyed it in my teen years.It had no ups and downs or surprising twists, but it also didn't bore me for a second. I just liked to watch the protagonists going through their lives and the story being unfold.It is a solid movie with incredible visuals, sympathetic characters and a nice story.It has no explosions, but it is still better, than all transformers movies altogether (which are really really bad), so if you like nice movies with a little bit of message, which just let you forget your problems for two hours and just let you enjoy the mood, then watch it.If you like post-apocalyptic settings, even better!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Divergent is awesome,"Divergent is a movie that's based off a book by Veronica Roth. It's about a world where everything is divided in 5 factions. Candor - the honest, Amity - the peaceful, Dauntless - the brave, Erudite - the smart, and Abnegation - the selfless. There is a girl, Tris (Beatrice) who finds out she's divergent. Divergent means they belong in more than one faction and are a threat to the faction system. She discovers a plan to destroy divergents and fights everyone with Four.In Divergent, the main characters are Tris (Shailene Woodley), Four (Theo James), Eric (Jai Courtney), and Jeanine (Kate Winslet). This movie is an action movie, and it's a lot like Hunger Games and Catching Fire. Tris leaves her faction (Abnegation) and comes to Dauntless, trying to hide her divergence. She meets Four and with him, she finds out that Jeanine, the Erudite leader teamed up with the Dauntless leader (Eric) and they plot to destroy divergents. I really like this move because the plot is very interesting, it's a mix of harry potter and hunger games, and it has a lot of fighting which makes it very interesting.I think divergent is a really good movie. Shailene Woodley acts exactly like the way Tris is supposed to be in the book.

Oh dear soooo awful,"It starts and it wanders around trying to capture you; even get you hooked. We watched it thinking that surely it would get better.

"An OK book adaptation - just sit back enjoy, but don't think too much into the plot","Veronica Roth's series gets the silver screen treatment with the first film adaptation Divergent.Set in a post-apocalyptic dystopian society, our protagonist fights against adult authority and existing social structures amidst violence as the protagonist transitions to adulthood. Sounds like most young adult novels being made into movies but, loosely summarized, that is the plot for Divergent. While not having personally read the books I was familiar with the series from seeing the distinctive covers monopolizing shelves in bookstores.It is in the details that Veronica Roth's novel Divergent differentiates itself from its peers. The tale begins in the future in a decimated Chicago some time after a debilitating war. Society is no longer sustainable as a democracy and a new system is set up to prevent future conflict and maintain peace. Now the population is divided into virtuous factions: altruistic Abnegation, intellectual Erudite, kind Amity, honest Candor, and protector Dauntless. Adherence to the faction system is imperative to its success and is dependent upon individuals within the population identifying and belonging to a specific faction, and only one faction. Those who identify with multiple are called Divergents and can not be controlled or contained.Beatrice is the daughter of one of the superiors within the Abnegation faction; the faction that governs the city. She and her brother Caleb are of age to test and choose a faction they will remain with the rest of their lives. When Beatrice takes the aptitude test the results are inconclusive, a rarity and a dangerous one at that, and she must choose her own path. Though truly a Divergent she chooses fearless Dauntless.She leaves her life and family behind, transforming from Beatrice to Tris. Along with the other transfers she begins training as Dauntless under the coaching of Four. She must persevere and prove herself Dauntless or be cast aside to the undesirable factionless if she falls below approval standards. Or worse, be killed if found out to be Divergent. All the while the Erudite faction are working tirelessly to discredit and overthrow abnegation to become the new ruling faction.It's a riveting tale for the YA book adaptation Divergent. The back-story is fed to audiences well to provide sufficient narrative seamlessly within the protagonist's plot. The film is action packed with fight scenes with a minor love interest line for the teens. All casting and acting is spot on. The set design really produces a dilapidated cityscape with costumes modern enough to pass for a sci-fi future. Divergent is good despite what it is: a Hollywood blockbuster to appease the masses and make boatload of money.The issue is with the character development which is lacking as soon as Tris lands in the headquarters of Dauntless. At that point, all evolution is from the physical training and the film turns into one fight scene after the other and the movie just blends and fades. There just has to be something more to the story between the characters in the literature. The audience is supposed to believe that the teens are fighting for their livelihoods but there are few exchanges besides pats on the back and chummy punches to the arm.Divergent is action packed, glossing over development details rather than creating a fully realized futuristic story. Hollywood gets its hands in Roth's novel and turns it into a typical blockbuster with the unrelated top-40 soundtrack to match. These minor details should not deter those from enjoying the film. If you look deep within the plot you will find darker broader themes regarding conformity and independence.More recent movie reviews can be found at our website.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Good books - bad movie,"I didn't expect much from the movie, produced by Summit Entertainent. It surely supposed to be next Twilight Ssga. But in case of Twilight the original book source wasn't itself Dostoevsky or Fitzgerald, so they did the best they can. But Divergent trilogy is good. I was surprised how better the scenes sequence is written in the books than it appears in the movie. This movie could be next Hunger Games, but the laziness of producers and, especially, scriptwriters made a movie look pale in comparison with brightness of the books. So the Divergent movie is another bad book adaptation, which is pity, because they could do much better, having a good example (i.e. Hunger Games)",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I haven't read the book but the film sucked,I don't know how often the other reviews watch a good movie but this isn't one of them.The whole film for me lacked any real goal. There's a good concept there but I always felt like I was waiting for it to get to a point as to why she is special.She has no ability to do anything that any other person cant do. The story makes out that its going to be like a hunger games type battle but it just fades away.This film for me was just life less...I almost left halfway through and was the first out of my seat to leave before the credits started to roll.If you want to watch something currently out thats predictable but with some action i'd watch Captain America.This film has inspired me to write a review on here purely because people hyped it up and I was sorely disappointed,2.0,Anonymous,Mystery

This is not Hunger Games. This is not Twilight,"Despite what most people think this is nothing like ""The Hunger Games."" Are there similarities? Yes, but there are also similarities to the Giver and I don't hear people calling plagiarism on that. While some of the dialogue is a bit cliche, and it felt like I'd seen some of the movie before, as a whole, I enjoyed it. They could have chosen a better actress for the main character, Tris, because at times it feels like Shailene Woodley is not delivering the dialogue as she should be. Sometimes she sounds bored, and sometimes she overacts, but Kate Winslet portraying the evil leader of their post-apocalyptic world saves it because she's almost as creepy as Donald Sutherland's portrayal of President Snow in the Hunger Games. I enjoyed the subtle bits of humor sprinkled throughout what is otherwise a dark film. The first hour or so was a bit slow, but the third act was great. I was really enthralled by Hans Zimmers' score, and the electronica music inserted here and there, even though it makes no sense to have it there. I have never read the books (and don't plan to because I want to be surprised) but still enjoyed the film. This is one YA novel film adaptation series I hope succeeds.

"Not as ""divergent"" as one would think from other sci-fi thrillers","Being in a futuristic eutopic society is not all it's cracked up to be. Throughout film, there have been plenty of movies that take place in the future where Earth has become a robotic like eutopic society. People must follow certain guidelines to maintain stable tranquility. Of course, because the main inhabitance are human, one individual is bound to think differently from the rest, thus making them different and a possible ""threat"" to everyone else. It's one of those self-discovery stories where the main protagonist must figure out for himself or herself where they belong among everyone else. This is what happens to a young girl named Beatrice.To know one's place in the world she lives in, citizens take a mental aptitude test which then they have the choice themselves to follow through on their test result or choose their own. Among these groups to choose, there's Factionless (poor), Abnegation (the givers), Candor (truthful), Amity (friendly), Dauntless (fearless), Erudite (the brains). Tris, as Beatrice will call herself later, chooses Dauntless not only because it fit her better than Abnegation of which she originated, but also because she discovered she was Divergent through the mental test. According to the world she lives in, Divergent individuals are being hunted due to how unpredictable they are. It is at this point Tris must learn how to keep herself under the radar.This story is very character based. Audiences are introduced to a slew new people along the way and surprisingly it's easy to follow. Plus, the actors play their roles with the right amount of charm to feel a connection to each of them, including the not so nice ones. Shailene Woodley as Tris is likable and is able to show genuine emotion when the time came. Tris also meets one of the leaders named Four (Theo James) who looks like a cross between Billy Zane and James Franco. He also gives his character the correct amount of enthusiasm to be interested in understanding more. The rest of the Dauntless crew that Tris gets to know is played by Ben Lloyd-Hughes, Christian Madsen and Zoë Kravitz, all of which give enjoyable human performances. Possibly one of the most likable jerks in this story however was Jai Courtney as Eric. His duo deadpan and mean spirited attitude make him one to be reckoned with and probably Courtney's best role thus far.We also cannot forget the supporting characters played by the underrated Ray Stevenson, Tony Goldwyn, Mekhi Phifer and Kate Winslet. All of which have very minor roles but important ones nonetheless. What is really apparent about this character driven story was Neil Burger's direction of which the kinds of choices he had this character's make and the writing provided by Evan Daugherty (Snow White and the Huntsman (2012) & Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014)) and Vanessa Taylor (Hope Springs (2012)). The development was one of its strongest points. The cinematography by Alwin H. Küchler (DP of R.I.P.D. (2013)) looked decent as well. He was able to show the contrast between what people normally see on the surface and the underground operations people don't know about. Even with a minimal amount of special effects they too were integrated well into the movie. No complaints there.Though even with all these good points, the film still suffers from other issues. For one, there are loopholes in its story. If this particular society is so rigid and perfectly made so there are no problems, why is it that there are still problems? How is it that if one character can change factions, the upper authorities won't know? This movie's running time was very close to two and a half hours, I'm sure they could have fit a quick explanation in somewhere. Then there was the music composed by Junkie XL. It certainly was a tolerable score with its hybrid mix of electronic and orchestra but there wasn't much to remember it by nor were there any themes for the franchise or characters themselves. It was effective in its scenes but still disappointing. Lastly, the action was a bit bland. It's obvious that it wasn't a full out action movie but audiences might expect more than a few fight sequences, a ""captured the flag"" like scene and a some other shootings. Perhaps it'll escalate? We will see. It certainly isn't a waste of a movie but it did need improvement on all other aspects besides its characters.This movie is like the reversal of other fantasy films. It has a big cast with competent actors and writing that develops its characters effectively. With this, its supporting elements don't seem as exciting with average music and somewhat uninspired action scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Surprisingly well-developed plot and characters with a good visual feel.,"While The Hunger Games really cornered the market in the ""young adult dystopian future"" category, many authors jumped on the bandwagon to cash in on this phenomenon. I'll admit that many of these series that got movie adaptations I had never heard of before and likely will not see/read. The Divergent series, though did stand out as the top of ""the rest"".It can be difficult to create a dystopian world, especially one that's at least somewhat set in our current one. The CGI-modified Chicago looks pretty good for a city that's been through what it has, but where the computer imagery really comes to shine is in the dream sequences. I would have liked them to be a little more obvious so the audience isn't always guessing if it's a dream or not, but that's part of the charm, I suppose. Having since read the book this was based on, I do have to say that the director made some good decisions on what areas to cut in order to keep the intent of the book, but at a pace that works better for a film. In fact, the dream sequences were even more difficult to pin down in the book than they were in the movie, so the film did a good job with that.However, this film still struggles with the ""teenage angst"" that many YA adaptations have. Of course, because of this and the aforementioned CGI, this film does get the feeling like it's a mashup of The Hunger Games and Avatar: The Last Airbender. That being said, the plot and societal structure felt thoroughly thought out and it truly helped distinguish between character archetypes when they are connected to specific colors.Surprisingly well-developed plot and characters with a good visual feel, I give Divergent 4.0 stars out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Having seen the movie, I can only conclude that they simply used the idea behind ""The Hunger Games"" and added a bit of Harry Potter (the serum-induced psychological test to determine a person's faction reminded me of the Sorting Hat).So, this franchise doesn't come across as anything original.

"Treat Divergent as another version of The Hunger Games, then it works.","After the success of the first Harry Potter movie that later that spawned a very successful series of movies or the Twilight movies that made big money off the "" teenage vampires and humans in love"" theme, it has become more and more common each year for the studios to look for successful teen novels that could spawn a film series. It does come at some risk though as a film like Vampire Academy from this year was a bomb and critically panned followed by a cancelled series. This was a prime example of a film based on a teen novel-based film that didn't quite work and there are other examples.Being not a reader of the Divergent book series, I was clueless as to what Divergent was all about. Based off the popular teen novel written by Veronica Roth, Divergent is a three part trilogy with two spin-off mini stories on e-books. In total, this series could be possibly five films and by judging from strong box office from it's first week, you wonder what kind of money how much a movie series like this could make or how long it could last.Based in the future in a dystopian society in Chicago, Divergent's setting is a world where everyone is put into specific factions based on their own virtues. Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) learns that she is a ""divergent"", an extremely rare condition in which a person can't be assigned due to one faction because she has the attributes of many factions. Divergents are considered threatening by the government because they are free-thinkers who cannot be controlled by the government. Later after Tris puts herself into Dauntless, a faction of people based on courage, it becomes evident that the main faction leader Jeannie Matthews (Kate Winslet) is planning to kill any divergent that they can identify. Tris must find herself, fight her enemies and learn to survive all at the same time.Like The Hunger Games and other sci-fi films, I am always interested in seeing a dystopian society if done right. Shot in Chicago, this dystopian setting offers real some cool shots of the city including Navy Pier and Michigan Avenue. Most of the film interior sets are placed in what seems to be abandoned warehouses which gives the film a different and hollow atmosphere. This dystopian society of Chicago is enclosed by a big wall and it seems as if this government wants it's people to be held up within the walls forever. The movie gives no hints as to why the city is walled up or what is beyond the walls and you really would hope a sequel will give some type of explanation on this. Still though, the setting here is a strength of the film.With yet another correlation to Hunger Games, rising star, Shailene Woddley works as the young adult lead who's trying to rise up against this society and who you do root for. Her instructor for Dauntless, Four Eaton (Theo James) is both a mean and likable character and a romantic relationship eventually develops between the two. The chemistry between them is not there at first but it eventually falls into place. Peter (Miles Teller) is the mean member of Dauntless and you can say the only cast member who brings humor to the story. Divergent has a big cast filled with a lot of depth and emotions from the characters.Where the idea of ""training"" as Hunger Games was only a small aspect of that movie, one of the main themes of Divergent is training. The training is often brutal as we see many people trying to get into Dauntless who did not get to a certain level and then were thrown into the streets. Much of the training is people fighting one on one and further you are tested on your fears. For example, to even enter the training building, you have to jump down a big hole in a building where you do not know what is below.Unlike the Harry Potter movies or The Hunger Games, this is a much more dark film based on a teen novel. The overall tone is quite dark with a suicide and an attempted sexual assault depicted among other things. This might not be some of the most fun things to watch but it does add variety and possibly brings a slightly different audience to Divergent than some of the other teen films mentioned earlier.Divergent can be very long and also tiresome at points. It also has some lack of originality but there is still a lot to like here. Treat Divergent as another version of The Hunger Games, then it works.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Thrilling and Engaging Adaptation,"Divergent is a thrilling and engaging adaptation of the popular young adult novel of the same name by Veronica Roth. The movie is set in a dystopian future where society is divided into five factions based on personality traits, and follows the story of Tris Prior (played by Shailene Woodley), a young woman who discovers she is ""Divergent"" and does not fit neatly into any one faction.The world-building in Divergent is impressive, with a detailed and well-crafted society that feels both familiar and unique. The action scenes are intense and well-executed, with a good balance between physical combat and emotional tension. The film also explores themes such as identity, conformity, and the dangers of a society that values conformity over individuality.The cast is excellent, with Woodley delivering a standout performance as Tris. She brings both vulnerability and strength to the role, making Tris a relatable and inspiring protagonist. Theo James also shines as Four, Tris's love interest and mentor, bringing a quiet intensity to the character.While the movie does have some flaws, such as pacing issues and a lack of depth in some of the supporting characters, it still manages to be an entertaining and thought-provoking film. It successfully captures the spirit of the novel and delivers a satisfying adaptation that will appeal to both fans of the book and newcomers to the series.In conclusion, Divergent is a well-made and exciting film that offers a fresh take on the dystopian genre. With a great cast, strong themes, and impressive world-building, it's a movie that is sure to please fans of young adult fiction and action movies alike.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Teen flick delivers,"My teenage son is into these teen novels and he said Divergent was OK, so I took a shot.I found it similar to Harry Potter and Hunger Games. There are 5 Factions. You get to pick the one you want and somehow this is supposed to keep the peace after a 100-year war. Humhh.Like Hogwarts, the Factions represent different skill sets. Unlike Hogwarts, you get tested first, and a Faction usually comes out as dominant. I no dominant trait comes out, in rare cases, you are labeled a Divergent. The government, which apparently wants to control people, does not like Divergents, and they typically find them and make them disappear.Similar to Hunger Games with evil Donald Sutherland, except here you have Kate Winslet, who plays the evil government leader.The lead female character breaks from her family, and loves her family, but still has to do what she has to do. The training scenes are pretty good, and the story is entertaining.In the end, these stories leave the ending completely open, and you have to wait for part 2 to find out what happens next.

An excellent film.,"After the resounding success of ""Hunger Games"", American studios were hungry for more films and trilogies for young adults. ""Maze Runner"" and ""Divergent"" were two of the most evident, with scripts and source material that, in everything, remind us of ""Hunger Games"". In this film, the beginning of another trilogy, we are presented with a dystopian future: the human race faced the Third World War and almost died out.In order to regain peace, the survivors grouped in the city of Chicago and created factions, in which they engaged according to their vocation: Erudite grouped intellectuals, teachers and scientists; Amity did the same with farmers, manufacturers, artisans and traders; Candor includes magistrates, lawyers, bailiffs and lawmakers; Dauntless welcomed the police and military; the Abnegation brought together civil servants, doctors, nurses, social workers and all those who dedicate their lives to helping others. By their characteristics, they are also the political leaders. The faction is chosen in adolescence, after a vocational test that should help, or even indicate, to which faction you belong. There are also those who have no faction or have left theirs, and who live in misery. In a system where the faction is more relevant than family, being without a faction is being excluded from society.The young protagonist is Beatrice, or Tris, whom the vocation test indicated belonging to more than one faction, that is, being a Divergent, a serious threat to the faction system. Choosing to join the Dauntless, she will face serious difficulties to integrate and pass the tests presented to her. To make matters worse, her father, who is one of the leaders of the Abnegation, is being questioned by the strength of the Erudite, led by the cruel Jeannine, eager to rise to power, albeit by violence.I really liked the movie, overall. At the time it was released I felt it went quite unnoticed, overshadowed especially by ""Maze Runner"". Now that some years have passed and the success of the competitors has faded, it was interesting to see this film, I felt that I could appreciate it better and that the film has aged well until now. The story is good, it holds us to the end, and it develops in an engaging way.The cast is quite good and competent at what they should do. I especially liked Shailene Woodley, who I didn't know until I saw her here. She is good at what she does, she has talent and, on a more personal note, she is identical to an old flame of mine, which is almost the same age as her, and that of course made me remember my own past. Theo James was also excellent, particularly in the action scenes, where he seems cut out for the role. Miles Teller is just as good, especially considering that his character is hateful. Equally worthy of our hatred is the character of Jai Courtney, who is very good at the task of being rude, brutish and somewhat sadistic. Kate Winslet is cold and insensitive, and in fact she performed very well, but I don't know if I would bet on her as the first choice for the character. The film also features Zoe Kravitz, Ansel Elgort and Ashley Judd.Technically, the film is visually impressive. The cinematography is excellent, vibrant and sharp, and I loved the landscapes of a half-destroyed and decadent Chicago, of dry rivers and lakes, and devastated buildings. Incredible, but not coherent: if the entire human population was there, wouldn't more space be needed? Why not rebuild all? Didn't they have two hundred years of peace to do so? Another thing I liked and found amazing was the action and fighting sequences. Really well executed. I also liked to see Intrepid climb buildings with ease ... in a city that is famous for its strong winds (another logic problem that can only be forgiven for being less relevant). The sets and costumes were very well done and the soundtrack also fits into the overall set.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

And made the movie different but still awesome as the book.The movie charters: I'n the beginning i expect Tris less beauty. And in the movie i king of like in one strange way Petter, a big amount of that its because of the actor that represent Petter, he is funny and alway's smiling, in the book i get a more ruff idea of Petter and don't really enjoy the Character in the book.The movie effects: I mean, wow, i was expecting a good production but never like this, never in my imagination i have the time or the ability to create all that instruments and stuff they show on the movie. I men little stuff like the way the cups of serum are made, the way the city's are destroyed and all the wind fans systems in the buildings... All that environment stuff that the movie bring to the story king of give it a now approach even using the same arguments. I was not expects the scene when they throw themselves from the building hanged by one rope. In the movie that was awesome, beautiful... Made me make a little smile and king of feel a title of the freedom that Tris was feeling.Music: You know what i am talking... :D I'm not a big fan of Ellie Goulding but you need to accept that her songs in that movie are just well placed, and even when the movie strait's to touch your hearth where it came one song that melt your feelings and make you live all the charters of the movie.Overall: I thins its kind of obvious that i love this movie... Because i don't think you can understand that string of thinking but, when you read that state of the art book you don't expect to someone to take that and make it even better. In your mind you know that's possible but its really close to impossible.

Really good but still disappointing.,"I loved the book, which I read about three years ago and that's the problem.If I'd watched the film without reading the book, perhaps I'd have given it an eight or a nine but, even though it is faithful to the book, I find the film does not live up to the book's promise.I think this is mainly because some of the actors play their characters in such a way that their personalities are too easy to read.There are exceptions. Janet for instance and Christina were both played as if they were three dimensional people with lives before and after the story begins and ends. I also found Four quite credible but sadly, Triss the dauntless did not leave up to the promise she showed early in the film as a wannabe.And Yet...Overall, I found the film worked very well.

There is however a group of people that have more versatile personalities, called 'divergent', and the establishment wants to terminate them because they are considered as problematic.The main character realises that she belongs to this rare group of people which instead of causing her to feel special she knows she is material for extermination.On the positive side, there is a futuristic look and feel to this movie, people accept they are not free and somehow try to live with this reality. There is even some resemblance with the Hunger Games and it does convey a decent moral story where one could even go so far as to think this is some form of North Korea.Whilst the story has merits, it does not go very deep and the tendency to insert a romantic story into this fight for survival deprives it from further points.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Diverting... but it doesn't quite hit the mark and it's just too familiar.,"To me, 2014 seems to be the year of the shallow attempt to recapture the financial magic of ""The Hunger Games"". First you had ""Divergent"" and then you had ""Maze Runner""---and all three games are aimed at the same audience and are pretty much the same movie in so many ways. All are set in a manipulative futuristic dystopia and all are aimed at creating franchises that will bring in the audiences like lemmings--ready to toss wads of cash at the studios. Don't get me wrong--these aren't bad movies but they are clearly lacking in creativity because the plots are, beneath it all, EXACTLY the same. All feature a plucky nobody who ends up somehow being different--and able to destroy the evil system despite the odds. Whatever....all I know is that because they all follow this formula there really isn't a lot to distinguish them. I say just watch ""The Hunger Games"" films and be done with it.So what do I like about this film? After all, it's not a bad movie and it's pretty well made. I think the look of this futuristic dystopian Chicago is pretty amazing. I loved seeing huge swaths of the city gone green as well as the drained Lake Michigan--not to mention all of the buildings in serious states of disrepair (though this former part may not be all that different from some parts of the city today). It looked great and gave you a wonderful futuristic look. Apart from this, the script was mildly diverting and it did hold my attention. The acting was generally good. On the negative side, too many times I felt as if I needed Cliff Notes from the book to understand exactly what was happening and several times there seemed to be logical jumps that could only be explained if you assume the characters were reading these as well. I was really annoyed late in the film where the heroine is out on her mission to stop the genocide--with dozens and dozens of killers chasing her. Again and again, she kept stopping...stopping to cry, stopping to catch her breath and just stopping for dramatic effect. Hello?! Folks are chasing after you with guns....KEEP MOVING!!!! Stop stopping!!! Yet, you can only assume she knew that she could save the day so there was no hurry!My overall feeling about this one is that it's good that the film has come and gone from the theaters, as I'd never recommend you pay your $10 to go see this one. However, as a DVD rental, it's about right.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Most disappointing movie I have seen in a very long time.,"I have never walked out of a movie so mad at the cast and writers of a movie in my life. Divergent is my favorite book and I hate to see the plot literally slaughtered as I observed at the Thursday night premier. I cannot believe this is the book I love so much. Entire chunks of the plots were missing- and not subtle ones either. Very KEY EVENTS ARE NO WHERE TO BE FOUNS WITHIN THIS FILM. it is a waste of time to go see it in theaters. If you must watch it, I suggest just going to redbox or another rental place when it comes time for the movie to be released. And I am not trying to be that negative person that leaves bad reviews on anything and everything. Usually it is very easy for me to find the good in something but not in this. The mood of the movie was entirely different than it was in the book which disturbed me. The relationship between Tris and Tobias is very different than it is in the book which was something I could not get over. Along with the fact that the ending was completely changed.So basically, they spent a year on this movie to get the title and some of the characters names right. And everything else is wrong.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Another fine acclaimed novel on a big screen,"Several years recently, there are many women's adventure novel put into motion picture. Not many of them got great response, the rest just failed and disappointed. ""Divergent"" is more likely in the middle between those films. It's not that horrible but not so special either. The theme is quite familiar and seems formulaic with other fantasy movie. It has an uninteresting plot, soulless and predictable at climax which could make some audiences feel exhausted after seeing this. Luckily ""Divergent"" is still engaging as a movie and an impressive performance by Shailene Woodley as Tris has also raised this first installment from disaster. Perhaps ""Divergent"" won't make me curious to see the sequel but the movie undeniably has a fine premise as opening franchise and got potential to be fascinating.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Nothing standout,"It's a mixed bag for sure. Based on the popular young adult novel, it promised to be a thrilling ride through a dystopian Chicago, but it ended up feeling a bit average. Shailene Woodley, as Tris, does her best to bring depth to her character, and you can really feel her struggle with identity and belonging. However, the plot often feels formulaic, following the classic dystopian formula of rebellion and identity crisis. The world-building has some interesting concepts, with factions that represent different human traits, but it never quite dives deep enough into them. Some parts felt rushed, and I wish they had explored the factions more instead of jumping straight into Tris's intense training and conflict. The action scenes are decent, but they're not groundbreaking. You get some cool visuals and a couple of heart-pounding moments, but the stakes don't always feel high. And let's be honest, the whole love story between Tris and Four is a bit cliché and predictable.It's entertaining enough for a weekend watch, especially if you're a fan of the genre. It's not a bad movie, but it's definitely not the standout revolutionary hit it aimed to be. If you're in the mood for some YA dystopia vibes, give it a shot, but don't expect to be blown away.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Very Different,"When I saw this movie had been released I was almost immediately interested. So I went to see this movie with my boyfriend and I got really sucked into the movie. I thought it was a very interesting concept (however, I could never ever see this happen in real life), having five factions that live in a city, but not really together, and then there are the faction-less, who basically have nothing. I really, really enjoyed the movie and decided to look up some more information when I got home. I found out there is a book trilogy of which this film is based off and as I love reading books I decided to start reading the trilogy.When I started reading the book I found some big differences in the character development in the movie in comparison with the book. The Dauntless hide-out is also completely different in the book and a lot of details are changed throughout the movie, which makes the movie go from one thing to another in a second. That was also the moment I realized that not everything in the movie was displayed in the good smoothness the books describe it. And I also only started to understand certain things in the movie after reading the books.It is a really hard task to make a movie in which a lot of details make sense for the continuation for the other parts of the trilogy into a movie of just two hours.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Don't waste your money.,"I saw this movie on opening day. This movie was terrible, I didn't go in thinking it would be my favorite movie, but was left very bored, and ready for the movie to end 30 minutes in.I watched this movie with my wife, who loves movies based off books, and she was not a big fan as well. The guns used in this movie were something you would find at Toy's R Us.Plot line was very boring, and the lead female role was beyond boring, dull, and didn't come off as she was supposed to be. For the future movies which I will never see, RE-CAST. She may have done well in other movies, but this is not her cup of tea.

True to the Book,"I really expected this to be another crappy book-to-movie film, as I'm used to at this point. After reading the Divergent series a couple times and obsessing until the movie out, of course I went the night of the premiere, a little leery because I didn't want to get my hopes up. There were, of course, not ALL of the major character developments in the film or perfect events to keep everything rated PG-13, however all of the most important parts of the book were in the movie. The acting was actually surprisingly good (I'm looking at terrible b-2-ms, Twilight, Hunger Games, Eragon etc etc) and the casting was perfect, save for scrawny Peter? But other than that, the amount of racial and gender diversity was refreshing, the costumes unique and somehow modern and futuristic, and the movie ended on slightly less of a cliffhanger than the book.And you wanna know why?Because the AUTHOR helped PRODUCE IT.10/10, Recommending to everybody I know and looking forward to buying the film on Blu-Ray.Oh, also, even if you haven't read the book (took a friend who hadn't) it was still bad ass.

I read the book before.,"The movie was so bad. It was a good concept from the beginning, so on its own it may have seemed great to those who haven't read the book. If you have read the book, however, you would have noticed that more things were left out than kept in, things happened at way different times than originally, important and thrilling scenes where twisted resulting in unimportant and boring parts, and many characters, thoughts, and important phrases were almost completely left out. This is the first movie that I have ever despised. However, whether you believe the movie is good or bad, and you haven't read the book, please read it for your own good. It is honestly one of the best I have read. Things you missed in the movie: The hardcore ship you will have for Christina and Will and, obviously Tris and Tobias, so many intimate moments, the fact that Four is not called Four by Tris once she knows his name, how Molly, Peter, and Drew are complete and utter butt holes and you will want them dead as much as Tris does, and many more that I can't list because of the word limit.

Its a PG-13 SciFi Adventure Thriller,"What did you expect? The Godfather? Granted I don't think its perfect but reading all these 1/10 negative reviews made me up my rating. You're a bunch of Erudites! Seriously, though, you can't watch Frozen and expect it to have Quentin Tarantino quality. Its like humor, not everyone has the same taste. Satire might not be your crucifix, that doesn't make a joke ""low quality"". The plot is pretty solid if you ask me, a post-apocalyptic society where the survivors developed a communistic system to avoid future chaos considering human nature drove the past civilization to destruction. Divergents have multiple aptitudes making them a threat to linear society. l admit I have above average intelligence, but even my 12 year old cousin understood the premise. The casting was splendid, Oscar nominee Shailene Woodley especially the scene where shes crying (no spoiler here) and Theo James' character develops well and opens up progressively and we were all genuinely terrified of Jai ""Eric""'s ruthlessness. Also Kate Winslet played a fine bitchy dame. The dialogue was believable and appropriate for the story (they were teens and this isn't a witty comedy). Overall, the story was thought-provoking. To those missing the bigger picture, there's actually a connection between this universe and ours. Our society also categorizes people either by race, religion, politics, culture, education, sexuality, school cliques (in a small range), etc. There's always expectations in each group, a social code that must be followed. I actually enjoy the way Divergent depicts authority in such a menacing way, showing how ridiculous these bigots can be. Why are there laws against gay marriage or against innocent children who were forced into the US and can't get an education/driver's license/job when they're adults? Ignorance, that's why. I hope this movie inspired its targeted young audience to rebel and fight for what is right in their judgment.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Fresh Spin on the Dystopian Genre,"When I sat down to watch this film, I expected something akin to The Hunger Games, but set in a near-future Chicago. While the basic premise - a dystopian society where everyone is forced to fit into rigid roles - might sound familiar, this movie brings its own unique take to the table.The story revolves around a world where people are divided into five distinct factions. But, as you might expect, not everyone fits neatly into these categories. Enter our protagonist, Tris (portrayed by the impressive Shailene Woodley), who discovers she's what the society calls ""Divergent"" - a dangerous label in this seemingly perfect world. Her struggle to hide her identity and uncover the truth behind society's fear of Divergents forms the crux of the narrative.I won't spoil too much, but the film blends physical and psychological challenges to immerse viewers in Tris's journey. The film's world-building is reminiscent of Equilibrium, though it swaps the relentless action for a more measured approach, which allows the cinematography to really shine. The visual composition of the dystopian cityscape is a standout, with scenes that are often breathtaking in their design.The pacing keeps the story moving as Tris navigates her new faction, Dauntless, while forging (and sometimes losing) friendships. Naturally, a romance blossoms with the mysterious Four (played by Theo James), though his performance occasionally strays into over-acting territory. Still, the chemistry is palpable, adding another layer to the plot.As the story unfolds, the bigger mystery - why the government is hell-bent on eliminating Divergents - becomes the driving force of the film. The narrative sets the stage for further exploration in what is clearly meant to be the first part of a trilogy.Although I haven't read the book, I feel the film does a commendable job of standing on its own. It may not have achieved the blockbuster success of The Hunger Games, but it's an underappreciated gem in the same vein. The similarities between the two are hard to miss, yet this movie still carves out its own identity.In short, this film offers a visually captivating, well-paced story, and while it has its moments of overly dramatic acting and picturesque scenes paired with carefully chosen music, there's little to complain about in that regard. Sometimes, it's nice to simply sit back and let a movie dazzle you - and this one does. Give it a watch; you won't regret the time spent.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"love, tragic, mean people included, horrors, not predictable events unlike other movies..","I found this movie Excellent!! At times I was confused but then I figured it out in the end. Although it contains violent actions I didn't find it that horrifying. I love how there seems to have time for romance when their world is being slaughtered, and how unpredictable the characters are, e.g. You would think a good guy (Four) wouldn't be controlled or nice but he can and he is not a Mr. Nice guy at all (UNTIL THE END).... etc. This movie is very confusing to understand but if you pause it and rethink what the character just said (the parts where you didn't get) (because I did that) you'll understand more clearer. The first time my nephews watched this they wanted to watch something else because at one point the characters are here then they go somewhere else but who can blame them they're only 10 and 8 and they weren't even allowed to watch this SO....

"Awesome story, simple movie!","I'm not that shocked! I mean... we have seen this before! It's like hunger games 1 all over again. It has an amazing story, but the movie is simple. What I mean by that is the fact that things just happen for some simple reason, which has a bigger picture, but we never get to experience that! They don't explain things good enough! They explain the training well, too well!!! Because one and a half hour of the movie is training and romance. That is pretty much it! I didn't get the point of the movie at all! The movie had a description, and that is pretty much the point. Everything that happens is so slow, but the ending which we were waiting for is super fast. We should have gotten some political discussion or something to understand why everything is happening. We get some facts at the beginning, but no government development or anything to make you root for the good guys, and some simple things to make you dislike the enemy, but that is not enough man.The story is very good I guess, but the movie doesn't get that much points for it. If the director was the one who made the story, it would have been different. But it is an adapted screenplay man. I enjoyed the movie, but thought it would be a little better, but I'm not disappointed. The action is OK I guess. It's cool but... it isn't impressive.This movie is an entertaining mix between hunger games 1 and twilight 1.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It seems that most of them have an issue with the dystopian world, but I'm wondering why would they watch a dystopian movie if they don't like these kind of things? I think it's not a combination of other dystopian books, because the only thing similar is the dark future, but otherwise I don't see any real similarities to hunger games. This movie is one of my all time favorites. I think it's a really good movie based on the book, not like others and the next parts of it, that don't have much in common with the book anymore. Also I loved the soundtrack, acting, cast and thought they portrayed everything as good as possible.

"Not as good as The Hunger Games, but very compelling","In this dystopian thriller, based on the novel series by Veronica Roth, Shailene Woodley plays Tris, a 16-year old girl living in a futuristic city divided by factions based on virtues. These factions include Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless, and Erudite. Everyone (when they reach the age of 16) is assigned to take a psychological test that determines what faction they should join, and in the end, they are allowed to choose the faction of their choice. Tris takes the test and gets the rarest result--Divergent, which means she would not fit any particular faction. When she chooses Dauntless, she and the faction leader Four (played by Theo James) discover the plot to assassinate all who are Divergent as they seen as a threat to social order; and decide they must fight back.To be clear, I never actually read the novel. Upon watching this, however, I found it very similar to the Hunger Games series. They both take place in a dystopian society that is divided up into factions (or districts), except there is no teenagers fighting to the death in a large arena in this one. While this wasn't as exciting and enthralling as the Hunger Games, it was very compelling and interesting to watch. The characters were great, I love how Shailene Woodley played Tris. It was a very interesting role her, especially since her role in the ABC family series ""Secret Life of An American Teenager"". Theo James was.........I guess okay as Four. I don't know if he was the best, but he didn't do too bad. The plot was pretty good, although it did drag a little bit in some spots. There were several scene where I started to lose interest, but when it reached it's climax, it got exciting. I enjoyed the climax towards the end, especially with Kate Winslet playing Jeanine, who is behind the whole to plot to take out the Divergents.Divergent is a pretty decent movie, although it might have been better if I read the novel series before hand. Yes, the film has its flaws but its intriguing to watch and if you a big fan of the novel series, you'll just might enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Unbelievably bad,"If you thought Hunger Games was bad this was even worse. Bland expressionless characters portrayed by actors who clearly had about as little training as the so called 'dauntless' in the movie. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting much, just some mindless entertainment, but this bland PG plot less crap had me questioning my instincts from an early stage and I actually sat through it. If you have any self-respect don't repeat my mistake. On the bright side it won't be very difficult to forget this one. The story line was like one written by an overenthusiastic 13 year old with aspirations to be a writer and a sycophantic audience pushing him/her along with mindless enthusiasm. However, it probably could serve as some entertainment to the under 12s, and that may well be the target audience so can't fault it in this sense.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Loved It!,"It's been a rough year for YA film adaptations. Some have disappointed, others just flopped due to too narrow of an audience. Fortunately, for fans of the Divergent series, this doesn't disappoint and has the potential to be a blockbuster action film whether you've read the books or not.There is much to say about this movie and tough to do so without going all fan-girl while doing so. I loved the book series and couldn't have been more pleased when I found out a movie adaptation was on the way. The casting was just about perfect, especially when you look at the two leads, Shaliene Woodley and Theo James. Their chemistry is off the charts, starting from their relationship as instructor/trainee and beyond. Woodley, who is everywhere these days, captures the character of Tris as I imagined her, taking her from the supposedly meek Abnegation daughter and growing into the strong leader of Dauntless. That she does so seamlessly is a testament to her acting. James, as Dauntless leader Four, takes the character beyond my expectations. He's sexy as hell in a quiet, sensitive, tortured way. Physically, he outshines everyone on screen, doing all of his own stunts and fighting which allows the character to jump off the screen. The rest of the casting was fine, Jai Courtney is intensely scary as Eric, Zoe Kravitz does a nice job as Christina. I love Miles Teller, and he does a decent job as Peter, Tris's nemesis, but he's the last person I'd expect in this role. Bottom line is that most of the secondary characters really take a backseat to the mains. At 2 1/2 hours, I'd say there just wasn't a way to tell the story and develop every character without compromising the movie.The movie itself is exciting, hitting all the important parts of the book. It's a tough job to sell a story that has a huge amount of background detail (what are the factions, how did Chicago end up as it is, why the animosity between factions, etc.). And, it's a fine line to walk when half your audience knows all of this and the other half sees the screen as a clean slate. Personally, I think the screenwriters hit the mark almost perfectly and what isn't developed in Divergent will be better explained in Insurgent.The action sequences are fantastic and believable, from the first jump off the train to the iconic zip line ride through Chicago.Whether you've read the book or not, this is a movie for everyone. If you like a story of finding out who you are and where you belong, regardless of how difficult the path is, Divergent hits the mark, regardless of your age. I've no doubt I'll see this again!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Not too bad,"I like the movie. More or less. Beautiful cinematography, rather good tempo. Good-looking actors. Of course, there definitely are gaps in the plot, and dialogues could be better...My main discourage for the film was the casting. As I've said, good faces, some of them are new. That's good. But acting is not good. I almost can hear the director's headache of dealing with that human material. In some point of viewing the film I've been thinking of Theo James as good actor, but to be honest, he is good only with the tremendous efforts of the director and editors and being on the background of worse actors. Much worse. The biggest disappointment is the main character played by Shailene Woodley.I get the idea of casting young actors. And I understand that it's hard to find good ones. But she even is not as good-looking as Theo James! Why was she chosen?Concerning the plot. It has weak points. (Not too many as The Matrix, of course.) The romantic line is too obvious and too disappointing for me. She is just in the age of majority and he is her tutor with notable experience. But I can tolerate all of these. More dislikes I have about the idea of future series of films in advance of doing the first one. Money above all?But, as I stated, not too bad.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good but not the Best,"I was really excited when Divergent finally turned into a movie. I've read the books and just loved it. To me it's a little like The Hunger Games where you have that insecure girl, who doesn't know where she belongs. She always protects the ones she loves and turns out to be a heroine with the love of her life by her side. In my opinion that's not necessarily a bad thing. I think having a girl heroin is a change from all the typical heroes, which are mainly guys. But the movie was not as good as I thought it would be. For one it seemed a little rushed to me and wasn't as good as the book. The reason why is because very good and important parts were just simply left out. I know the movie is already long as it is but I'd rather watch a movie that's a little longer than a movie, which is missing a lot of details.

Divergent is More than a Teen Flick,"Going to Divergent for some light diversion, I quickly realized: ""This no mere 'Hunger Games' copy cat! Let's face it, the premise of HG was ridiculous. The acting was wonderful and Jennifer Lawrence is a great actress. But the premise of Divergent is so much more probable (not just because I wrote a novel about 10 years ago with some similarities). Of course I had the same criticism. No one is just one aspect. But, for the age of adolescence, cliques are a painful reality; categories are everywhere: Nerd, Mean Girls, Grunge, Band Fags, Jocks, etc.But the acting is wonderful. The pieces in the mix, although familiar, fall together seamlessly. The dramatic suspense is at times very evocative. The timing and the choreography are fine tuned.

This movie really did have potential, decent actors and a good backbone to the plot but it just was too over complicated. The movie also reminded me a bit too much of the hunger games, it had very similar elements and character types which made it feel unoriginal and rushed. The movie shows how manipulating and controlling some people can be in order to gain power and control over others. I'd not recommend watching this film, a waste of time.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A very good movie,"I was pleasantly surprised with this one, because more often than not, movies that were books just don't do anything for me. The story kept me interested most of the time, I actually stopped doing my dailies in WoW to watch... so I would say it was a good solid 10 IMHO. It didn't hurt that the one they had playing Four was without a doubt, hot... and even the other instructor that was a butthead was kinda cute. The script seemed well done and though there were a few moments when I had to laugh at the delivery of lines... all in all it was good. I love my movies, and have watched more than probably any one person should, so I will count this among one of my favorites... and that is saying a lot. I also liked the fact it was set in Chicago instead of the always present post apocalyptic New York, though I would love to see a film destroy Philly once or twice... if there are any out there, please let me know!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Divergent Review,"So 2014 has really been the year for strong woman characters in movies.Scarlet brought us Black Widow and Lucy,Emily Blunt kicks ass in Edge of Tomorrow,Maleficent freakin dominated the theatres!That brings me to Divergent.The latest teen novel to movie adaption that is thankfully more Hunger Games than Twilight.Shailene Woodley plays Tris.A young woman living in some sort of futuristic ruin of Chicago that has these virtue based groups of people.When Tris finds out shes been titled Divergent she also stumbles upon an evil plot to take out all Divergents.Chaos and rebellion ensue and we get what is a total set up to a saga.Ill explain in a bit.Ms.Woodley really owns her role.I admit it took me a minute to really get behind her character at first but as she gets stronger and progresses so does you connection with her.Like Katniss is Hunger Games,Tris is another great big screen,female badass.Theo James does alright as Four.He's advertised as a love interest but in the end his relationship with Tris I ended up really liking their chemistry.Sure there's a smidge of romance but the film focuses more on the character of Tris and the adventure that the movie tells.The story by the way is OK.It had a bit of a slow build for me but once I learned more about how civilization is run in this universe and why certain events were happening I got more into the story.Some of the dialog was pretty weak though and you can definitely tell its a movie working on a smaller budget than say The Hunger Games movies.There are still some really good parts in this movie.Some of the action was shot rather well and good character development leads to some pretty intense moments like when two well liked characters are hurting each other.This movie is definitely setting up a sequel and future films which kinda drags the movie down but also leaves me interested in where this series goes.It lacks the sheer suspense and scope of Hunger Games but thankfully puts character and story before a suffocating love story and countless shirt ripping scenes.If you're a fan I RECOMMEND A PURCHASE. For casual movie watchers ITS WORTH A RENTAL! 7/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Underappreciated,"On account of various similarities this has been compared to the Hunger Games so I will be comparing this to that first movie and to be clear I do love both of these I just think this is the better one. This one has a more interesting better explained and more impactful system in the factions compared to the districts. I'm not sure I agree that the action is less plentiful but it definitely is more varied more emotionally engaging here. The last 20 or 30 minutes are significantly more impactful for reasons I can't get into without spoiling which I don't intend to do here. Ultimately part of it is the superior setup and payoff which does unfortunately come at the cost of pacing; this one has one chunk that is fairly samey and doesn't utilize as many distinct locations and situations. The love interest is more compelling.For some reason there are people who think this is juvenile and talks down to its audience; I disagree. I definitely think it is approaching it right considering this is for teenagers whose brains literally have not fully developed yet. Besides which yes what is being conveyed here is obvious but it hasn't been taken to heart by those in power. Go yell at them for not understanding something like this instead of pieces of media that put in the effort to make sure future generations do. Teenagers watching this grow up to become voters; it's extremely important that we influence them in the right direction, away from fascism, and this is doing that. The casting and acting are excellent everyone felt like their character from the book as I listened to it. I would recommend the novel to those who like the film and vice versa. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"This is a teenage movie, but what did you expect ?","This is just my opinion.I read the book and... Yes, it was cool ! So I wanted to watch the movie. This is a teenage book, so it is logical that the movie is a teenage movie, no one can complain about it.So, is the film as good as the book ?Like always, the film is a bit less good because it cannot show all the details of the book, all the reactions of the characters but Neil Burger directed a very entertaining movie.The scriptwriter found a lot of staging tricks to put all the important details of the story in the movie even if the script is a bit different than the book.The actors respect their characters, they are really good in their roles. It is interesting because often, the adaptation of a book series allows to discover some new actors who create a new generation of actors.I think it is a good start for the franchise which follows the steps of Hunger Games. If you liked the book, you will like the movie (of course there will be some deceptions like I said previously). If you like dystopian stories, watch it right now !",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Brilliant music, plot, characters...what more could you want?","If you're looking for action, romance and sci-fi then go see this movie! There are so many powerful messages embedded throughout the story, it is truly a very moving film. Not only the story but the setting and music. Hats off to Ellie Goulding and M83 for creating yet another masterpiece for the soundtracks. The music choice is what really got to me emotionally, it matched the film perfectly. I must say however, the trailer does the film no justice for I hadn't read the books and knew nothing of the plot. It looked cliché, lame and really bad. But boy was I wrong - I'm so glad i decided to watch this movie in cinemas for it is now my favourite movie! Some people didn't like the actors, but from the perspective of a person who hasn't read the books, Shailene Woodley and Theo James were too perfect, the chemistry was there and the relationship development was sweet and not too fast.

""The hunger games"" talk about different subject. this movie/book is thing that always be on my mind because the message that he send for me is connect to the heart. maybe i sound little kitchy but i believe that if someone really think about what the massage of this movie he is understand that this movie he is more then romance and sci-fi movie. this movie (more the book) shows us the way to live with something that you can't show to the world, and you try to found a way to do something without that people get know that you are different.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
All the charm of an army training film,"Divergent is about a post-war sci-fi world where everyone is divided into one of five clans/casts called factions. They are called erudite, dauntless (athletic militaristic), abnegation (selfless service and government), amity (happy farmers) and candour. Each teen must choose a clan for life. For no apparent reason, the choice cannot be changed. Oddly, even the erudite faction has no educational or training requirements for admission. If the clan eventually rejects them after hazing, they became factionless, similar to homeless in our society.Our heroine goes for a sort of career counselling where they pull out the stops on CGI. It is quite entertaining and mystifying.Unfortunately, our heroine chooses the mindless, loutish, tattooed, militaristic, boorish dauntless faction who do nothing but jump on trains, climb buildings, fight and run in packs.The world is a Republican wet dream where everyone is pitted against each other and the weakest are shamed, deprived and tormented.After a promising start, the movie degenerates into a sort of boot camp army training film. BORING.The whole premise of the movie that having more than one sort of skill is weird and dangerous makes no sense as does the rule you may never change factions.This is a movie for teenagers who fantasise about joining a criminal gang.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Better than the Hunger Games,"Divergent. One day during our school Easter holidays I decided to go and see the movie with my best friend. After reading the full series of books in a few days, I sat in await for the movie. And one things for sure, The movie was better than the book in my opinion.It started out a little bit slow, but once it got into full kick, the remaining movie was excellent. Whilst the 2nd and 3rd book are boring, if the movie was anything to go off, the next 2 movies will be amazing!Shailene Woodley (Tris) and Theo James (Four/Tobias) hit it of bring the latest ship FOURTRIS to the spotlight. With the help off the her friends Christina ( Zoë Kravitz) and Will (Ben Lloyd-Hughes), can she cope with the dauntless life? And when her friends are unable to help, can she fully trust her mentor?The director Neil Burger <-- LOL, really brought magic and suspense to the big screen.

Is Hollywood Making Entertainment or Socialist Propaganda?,"Boy, they really get the teenagers at an early age with the socialist propaganda these days. This movie reminded me of era of the Soviet Union. But there is romance and adventure, after your kids are indoctrinated, of course. Be careful of the nature of this movie.More socialist propaganda from Hollywood. If it were entertainment, I wouldn't mind paying for it. One should not have to pay for propaganda. Maybe Senator McCarthy was right.You know, if you look at America then and now and look at our forms of entertainment, what is coming out of Hollywood, the big brother shows in TV, the underlying message, you would probably reach the same conclusion.

"Amazingly Good! Of course, it's got flaws...","Divergent is another movie that joins the sci-fi YA genre. It's been compared to The Hunger Games multiple times, but I think they're not entirely similar, aside from being of the same genre. The world is very interesting. A dystopia disguised as a utopia. People live happily and in peace. Till a conflict arises between two factions and Divergents begin to get hunted down. It's got a lot of action and tension and danger for the main lead. The acting was not Oscar- worthy (though Shailene Woodley had her heart-breaking crying moments) but it wasn't horrendous. By the middle it felt like it dragged on a little bit but it pulls you in immediately. Like in the book, the is-dangerous-being-divergent thing wasn't fully explained and the world-building was not the best (though those who read the books know the origin of the faction system is explained till book 3). The climax was really good and we get to see Shai kick ass with her mother. Kate Winslet delivered a great performance as the baddie also. All in all, Divergent is an amazing movie with all the right touches of action, romance, humor, and intrigue. Since I'm a book fan, I am going to check out Insurgent, the second installment, but even if I haven't had read the books, I would have still wanted to watch it, to know what's coming next.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Never a dull moment. Great casting!,"Just returned from seeing Divergent. I have seen this movie FOUR times now in a week. Love this movie! I am not in the age range of teen to twenties that they did the movie for. Sadly for me I'm well beyond those days, but LOVED the movie any way. Took some of my friends in their 30s and they loved it too. The theater has been so quiet during the movie. Everyone is so into the movie. This is the quietest I have heard a theater in years. I have not read the books yet but had an interest from the trailers and finding Theo James in the movie. The cast selection is wonderful. The cast all seem to have a chemistry together and were placed in the perfect roles for them to play. I very much enjoyed the story and am planning to read the first 2 books soon. This breaks my rule of reading the book before the movie but something Theo James said has my interest really peaked to read the second book too. Theo James blew me away in this movie. He has inspired me through his portrayal of Four to want to try to live life more and to attack my goal of losing weight again even though I had given up on myself. The movie is action packed! Never a dull moment. Keeps you on your toes wondering what will happen next. I find in most movies in the last 5 years or so that my mind wanders and I get bored during some point in the movie. This is not the case with Divergent. Two thumbs up and a YEEEHAW (I'm from Texas) from me. Can hardly wait for the second movie and for the Blu Ray so I can continue watching. If I had to compare to another movie of course Hunger Games comes to mind. I enjoyed those movies very much as well, but would choose Divergent over Hunger Games. It was just so tightly put together and ended in a fashion where it could be a stand alone movie and didn't leave you hanging like that's it!?! Thank you all and best wishes to the Cast and Crew!!! I read there was a lot of pressure to make this movie great. Mission accomplished!!! But, I imagine the pressure will be just as bad or worse to make sure the second movie is just as strong and solid. All my best to you!!! I have faith it will also be a grand slam! :)",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

If you are a lover of action-packed movies then this is the one to see and what makes it better is knowing that Theo James did all they fighting scenes himself and no stunt double was needed. All I can say for this movie is that is was superb! Don't listen to the negative comments on here, this movie is a must see and perfect for lovers of The Hunger Games trilogy.

Despite of some flaws the film entertains,"Divergent is a science fiction action film directed by Neil Burger, based on the 2011 novel of the same name.

The story is both so predictable you will get it within the first few minutes of the movie and you might as well snooze through the rest. This movie doesn't have anything. No action, no comedy, no anything. Arguably is has a bit of drama but even that I found lame because it wasn't coupled with any good character development so I didn't really care for the good guys and was almost half rooting for the bad guys just so I can see some action.

I surprisingly good teen novel adaptation.,"I really didn't expect this movie to be any good. Thought of it as just another teen novel turned into a movie like Twilight. Surprisingly, the movie was pretty good.I loved its premise. A post apocalyptic world where Chicago is like Mankind's last safe place left surrounded by a huge wall. A five factions system ensures that no further war ever takes place. Kinda reminded me of Equilibrium and Hunger games.The story was pretty good. It follows a girl who tries to find her role in this faction system. The actress who played her did a fine job in my opinion. Liked her slow transformation, it was one of my favourite thing about the movie, her whole journey after joining a faction of her choosing, it was really good. Kate winslet plays the main baddie and she was pretty good. The rest of the cast was from okayish-lame. There were some emotional scenes here and there too, some executed perfectly, while others hastily.The CGI was a mixed bag. Some shots were good, while many weren't. Didn't distract much from the movie so that's a plus. Liked the soundtrack, had some nice pieces.The main dude was very generic however and just wasn't good for the most part. Also, the movie had some pacing issues, it often slowed down. And then there was the LOVEY DOVEY stuff that you get in these teen novels movie adaptations, never liked em and didn't liked it this time either.Still, a pretty good flick worth checking out. 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Hunger Games by another name,"Some girl in a dystopian future decides to buck the system when she discovers she's *vaguely* special and, in doing so, finds love while helping to bring down the corrupt regime of the time. Sound familiar? It is. Whoever wrote 'Divergent' obviously has read The Hunger Games and changed a few things here and there.But is it any good? The answer to that question really does depend on whether you liked The Hunger Games or not. If you did, you'll love this. If you didn't, this one isn't for you. It basically follows all the same rules. Instead of kids fighting it out for food, ala Hunger Games, you have kids who are split into five (supposedly radically) different factions after they complete a test in their early adolescent years. This *slightly trippy* test determines which faction they're destined to be part of for the rest of their lives.Of course if they don't agree with the test results they don't have to be part of that faction (I didn't get that bit). Then they all sit around in a big room and pick up a handful of rocks which tells them which faction they're going to be in (completely negating the test they took only days earlier). There are various factions which they could be in, all of which have names like the 'houses' in the Harry Potter films. However, about the only faction you'll remember is 'Dauntless' which is made up of some of the most annoying people you'll ever meet. They're supposed to be 'protecting' society, yet all they do is run around the streets making whooping and cheering noises while generally getting in everyone's way and practically knocking over old ladies. Our heroine (not Kaniss, but someone just like her) is conscripted into this band of nutters. However, she isn't destined to be a simple 'Dauntless' lass, she has traits from ALL the different factions, thus making her a 'Divergent'. And, apparently, being a Divergent means you need to be hunted down until you die.But, help is on hand for our Katniss-clone, in the form of a blatantly older hunky guy who'll have a love/hate relationship with her until he eventually decides he loves her.Yes, it has a budget, so the scenery is nicely futuristic and the actors play their parts well. They're either hunky and good. Hunky and evil, or hunky and annoying.I'm not sure how well this film will be received by cynical older males such as myself. However, I really don't think I'm its target audience. It's aimed at kids and, I'm reliable informed, the kids loved it.Does anyone else hear the words 'Hunger Games-sequel/franchise?'

One Flaw,"Overall the film is pretty spot on in terms of plot, characters, and the atmosphere created in the novels. One major flaw, it's simply too damn long. For me, I read the entire series, and I went into the film with low expectations. Happy to say that the film surprised me a few times, but after the 100 minute mark I lost interest. The film shouldn't have been so stretched out, seeing as they could have cut or even condensed certain unnecessary scenes like some of the mindless banter between Tris and friends, or even the first dining hall scene. I've found that those who have read the book agree with me. Thise who haven't enjoyed the pace because it made the film easy to follow and understand. So it's a win lose for viewers.In terms of technical, well I'm not that big a fan of some of the CGI, there are times when you can go ""oh this is definitely fake"" but all in all not a bad job. One of my favorite shots is when Tris is walking down the hallway to the main control room. Nice classic directioning and movement. I won't get too in detail seeing as most of you who read this probably haven't taken a film studies class before.I'd recommend this film, but only to those who have 3 hours to kill. Add up the 140 minutes of film and the inane previews and that's a grand total of about 160 minutes. Sad to say I actually popped my headphones in and started jamming because I just got so damn bored. Still the film is pretty good. Just try not to fall asleep.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

An insult to human intelligence...,"Take a brilliant concept that reflects some possible future scenario - inspired by the marvelous Aldous Haxley's 'Brave new world' - add a twisted 'matrixinian, hunger games' wanna be variation from Veronica Roth - and finally make a Hollywood film out of it; what do you have? An insult to human intelligence.The first 5 minutes of the film, focused on the essence. They where great. The rest of the long 2 hours where a bad mixture of the hunger games without the hunger, the matrix without mr Anderson, star treck without the stars, and dumb running, kicking, fighting, agonizing for no reason what so ever mambo jumbo.Overall quality? No better than a B class TV series. So why 7.4 in IMDb? Surely can't tell (paid reviews I presume). So I give a one star to balance things out.What is the message?

Could have been much more better,One of the big hits of 2014.Raise of Shailene Woodley and Divergent is a talking point.The movie Divergent is a sci fi flick centered mostly on the survival of Tris and her modern conflicted earth with partition of people into groups.I'm not sure that this sort of plot line is different from the Hunger games.The hunger games itself looked like a disappointed adaptation of Battle Royale.I don't think the movie can offer much because we are familiar with movies like this by now.If the movie had come before hunger games it could have won more appraisal.Shailene Woodley and Theo James were good.Plot was fine.Action was fine.Everything works but you kind of keep asking isn't this familiar to hunger games.In the end the movie makes way for a sequel without sorting anything.You will find this movie entertaining more if you hadn't seen hunger games.,7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Cerebral Games,"Since the release of the juggernaut ""Twilight"" back in 2008, Hollywood has been searching for any film, based on a young adult novel, that would spark the same craze those movies did. While some are successes, such as ""The Hunger Games"", there are countless others that just fall to the waste side. Does the new film ""Divergent"" rise to occasion or just fall into the same league as the other failures? The plots of ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Divergent"" are very similar but different in their own ways. Both take place in a futuristic society that has become a wasteland. The people in these societies have been split into different factions that serve their own purpose to the high power of the government. These governments try to play it off as if they are one of the people but, of course, stand for everything these societies are built on, which is freedom.In ""Divergent"", which takes place in a post-war Chicago, people are split into five factions: the selfless Abgenations, the peaceful Amitys, the honest Candors, the brave Dauntless, and the intelligent Edrudites. When children are sixteen they are given a test to see where they would fit in. After the results are given, they are must choose to go with what their results were or choose their own path. Our young heroine, Beatrice or Tris as she later refers to herself as, is urged by her family and faction in Abnegation to stay, but becomes part of the Dauntless. She wants to be part of the group who protects the city and lives a more wild lifestyle than the other four.The first half of the film is a bit slow paced. It is a very stereotypical journey of a fragile young woman slowly being transforming into a strong woman. As Tris, the film's star Shailene Woodley does just fine. Tris isn't as powerful of a character as Katniss from ""The Hunger Games"" but also isn't a complete bore like Bella Swan. She falls nicely in the middle. Though Woodley, at times, does play it bland at times she does own the role and makes you care about this young girl and her journey.Director Neil Burger does the future well. It is a very sterile future that seems too clean and pure for its own good. As far as the look of everything it echoes science fiction films like ""Logan's Run"". Burger does have some pacing issues with a run time that went a bit too long. It is close to 150 minutes. Some of it, especially the beginning, could have been trimmed a bit. The only other fault I would give the director would be the waste of the role that Winslet has. What is with Hollywood casting great actresses to fill roles that aren't good enough for their talents? It happened in ""Elysium"" with Jodie Foster and it does in this film with Winslet. It isn't a terrible performance but one that just requires them to go through the motions of being a typical female baddie, right down to the wardrobe.Those things that don't work are overshadowed by what does work. The film is quite smart in the way it handles what it has to say. The title of the film comes from those select people in society who have all the qualities of the five factions. They have the ability to have empathy and see situations as whole instead of just through their own factions beliefs. Of course, the higher ups, who are the Edrudities, don't want this because this would inspire hope in people through ideas. They are creating soldiers through brain washing their citizens into doing their dirty work. It is a an interesting way to communicate to younger people, who read these novels, the power of influence and the even greater power of fear of non-acceptance. Even though she can kick ass, which she does to her costar Milles Teller, who plays a sleaze bag here, who also starred with in the the terrific ""The Spectacular Now"", Tris' true power is her ability to influence others and show that they don't have to succumb to others beliefs. Woodley does have the pureness to sell this ideal. One of her initiation processes is facing her fears head on in a dream like sequence. Burger captures the insanity that goes through a young teenage girl's mind perfectly. Especially one in the wasted world where Beatrice grew up in. There are other surprisingly wise decisions made in this film to communicate the down falls of a controlled society which you should see for yourself.While ""The Hunger Games"" shows its points through a grand and epic scale, ""Divergent"" is more cerebral in the way it lays out its evidence. ""Divergent"" maybe the answer to people who like a less flashy way of telling them the downfalls of the ""perfect society",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

To learn what divergent's are is also awesome. My friend who came along with me, now his the one who can be critical on movies without knowing so when he says its a good movie, its had to do something good.I will not go into any details or anything like that but Shailene Woodley deserves credit she did well in her part. Giving a lead role in this movie would have been tough but did very well.So this movie is a good movie to watch so please go watch why not, it will not disappoint you.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not at all what i expected,"Good screenplay and all - but the actors where stiff, and the trailer gave off the idea of some amazing action / sci-fi movie - which turned out to be some teenage love story / empowerment to teenage girls. I went in expecting to be kept on the edge of my seat with all the exciting things, but when the people started jumping off trains, i seriously wanted to start cracking up laughing. I lasted about 20 minutes into this, then couldn't handle it anymore. I've heard people compare it to hunger games - WRONG. I love hunger games, this was just terrible!

A teeny-bopper young adult dystopia copycat of Hunger Games/Battle Royale,"Oh dear god why'd I go see this movie?! If I wanted Hunger Games, I should've went to see Hunger Games. Wait! No, I take that back. If I wanted Hunger Games, I should've watched Battle Royale. Cause if I'm honest, this movie is a copycat of a copycat. Oh how I miss the good old days! The good old days where if you went to see a movie set in a dystopian future where a corrupt government put its citizenry in peril on a whim, it was rated R because it contained great special effects, gritty foul language laced dialogue, and contained adult themes. But this! Okay! I understand the concept of movie studios dumbing this type of film down so tweens can partake in something that makes them feel like they are cool, or makes them feel like their rebelling. Even though they aren't really, they're just soaking up things that have been rehashed from what was cool 25+ years ago. Please!

THE HUNGER GAMES 2.0 is born,"Following suit of TWILIGHT SAGA and THE HUNGER GAMES, another young adult franchise embarks on its lucrative conquest, DIVERGENT, shares the same dystopia milieu in the future as THE HUNGER GAMES and a teenage female protagonist, Tris (Woodley), who fights to be fit in a world divided by five factions according to five virtues (erudite, dauntless, amity, abnegation and candour), but she is born to be a maverick who defies categorisation and is so-called a divergent. She joins the Dauntless and meets the mysterious Four (James), the trainer of the initiates, together their romance is budding through the training programs; then they discover Erudite leader Jeanne (Winslet) is scheming to annihilate and usurp the Abnegation faction (which is the present authority and where Tris' parents belong) to be the ruling class, meanwhile Dauntless members are hypnotised as the killing machine, only the divergent are immune to it. So by the end of the first chapter of the trilogy, they temporarily sabotage Jeanne's plan, which persists in eradicating the weakness aka. human nature out of human beings, but as cheesy as it sounds, actually love cannot be eradicated.Visual effects are mediocre at its best, the paralleled shift between the virtual and real world is less glamorous but pertinent to the engaging buildup of Tris' character, the mid-way rope- sliding in the night is a catharsis to feel thrilled and emboldened. The white-knuckle, adrenaline-driven, money-spending high point was never set alight, the entire procedure to scotch the scheme looks jejune, the last ditch to turn Jeanne into doing Tris' bidding is a knockout, but before that, the whole plan is a disorganised hash, the puny suspense agglomerated through the acting-like-robots gimmick never pay off, not to mention a hasty design to kill off Tris' parents, who else is psyched and wants to watch Ashley Judd kick more asses?On the philosophical ground, a future nation originated by Veronica Roth actually makes more sense than say, THE HUNGER GAMES (2012, 7/10), a virtue-divided society could be an ideal notion if only multiple options are applied. Our current spirit is that we should never be classified as any types, multifariousness is the keynote, so the vehement repercussions of its novel sources are totally justifiable.Shailene Woodley is the key to the success of the franchise, a timid next-door-girl as the first impression, but she has a dogged willpower, dare to chase her dream and bear a heroine's affinity, it is her star-making turn after her breakthrough in THE DESCENDANTS (2011, 8/10). Theo James, memorably remembered in his one-episode only guest appearance in the British sensational hit DOWNTON ABBEY (the unfortunate Mr. Pamuk), is a new rising star, DIVERGENT is his well-suited springboard, it is never too late to be a hot teen throb. Winslet, for the first time as a villainess in a studio project, similar to Jodi Foster in ELYSIUM (2013, 7/10), harbouring a high-flown goal but has little to offer except her evil mindset.I think I will be looking forward to the chapter two because I am hooked to see what will happen in the following step, which I have no clue since I prefer movie to book as a media to chiefly dispense my energy with, at any rate, THE HUNGER GAMES 2.0 is officially on and a young heart dies hard.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the worst movies I have ever seen,"Last year, I was dragged to this movie by my family. When the trailers were starting I said to myself, ""maybe it's not gonna be that bad, maybe I might really like it."". Then the opening narration started, and I knew I was going to be tortured. What followed was a long, (or at least felt long) crap-fest that rips off who knows how many movies. Bad acting, bad plot, bad action, and just plain bad. So far this is the only time I've fallen asleep in a theater. A lot of people are saying Shaliene Woodley is a good actress but after seeing this, I'm never going to agree with them. For Hollywood cash grabs, this is definitely one of the worst. To quote Roger Ebert, ""This is not scraping the bottom of the barrel, nor it is not under the barrel, it isn't ever the barrel. This movie doesn't deserve to be in the same sentence as the barrel."". People, save your money, skip this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not at all expected,"First, I will agree with some of the previous reviews that claimed the movie offered no new premise that hasn't been explored in recent ""tween"" movies. I have a teenage daughter, and have been forced through such movies as Twilight, The Mortal Instruments, The Hunger Games, etc. I expected Divergent to be cut from the same cloth. However, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. In the beginning, I thought the main actor (played by Shailene Woodley) was going to be of the same laconic and expressionless school of acting as Kristen Stewart. Her initial naivety was a little hard to swallow, and I was almost sure her her entire personality throughout the movie would be lukewarm. By the end of the film, I felt as though she turned the performance around, and I genuinely felt myself pulling for her. One of the main differences between this movie and some of those I've listed, is the genuine lack of palpable danger. There was a darkness to this movie that didn't rely on the supernatural to hammer the point home. The dystopian future realized in this movie was much more believable than the one found in The Hunger Games (in my honest opinion). This is one of the better movies I've seen in this genre, and one I would not mind following to its completion. I'm looking forward to the sequels, and will definitely be going to theater to see this with my wife and daughter.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good enough and enjoyable,"Action-packed and thrilling dystopian film that takes audiences on an adrenaline-fueled journey through a divided society.The film stars Shailene Woodley as Tris Prior, a young woman who discovers she is ""Divergent,"" possessing qualities of multiple factions in her post-apocalyptic world. Woodley's portrayal of Tris is strong and compelling, as she navigates a society where conformity is the norm.Divergent's premise revolves around a society divided into factions based on specific virtues, such as honesty, intelligence, bravery, and more. This concept sets the stage for an intriguing exploration of identity, belonging, and the dangers of suppressing individuality.The action sequences in Divergent are well-choreographed and exhilarating, immersing viewers in a high-stakes and fast-paced adventure.The film's dystopian setting adds a sense of urgency and danger to the narrative, as Tris must navigate a society filled with secrets, power struggles, and moral dilemmas.Divergent's ensemble cast, including Theo James as Four and Kate Winslet as Jeanine Matthews, delivers strong performances, bringing depth to their respective characters.While some may argue that the film follows certain young adult dystopian tropes, it still manages to captivate with its suspenseful plot and engaging characters.In conclusion, Divergent is an action-packed and thought-provoking dystopian film that offers a fresh take on societal divisions and individuality. With its strong performances, intense action, and compelling exploration of identity, it's a movie that keeps you engaged from start to finish.If you're a fan of dystopian adventures with a touch of rebellion and self-discovery, Divergent is a must-watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Amazing,"I'm usually not one to like teen movies but this on was impressive. Although it was really different from the book and left out scenes that my friends and I were looking forward to seeing, it was enjoyable. So the hand to hand combat is a little unprofessional but that's the point. They were all trainees. Some people said that the age difference between four and Beatrice are obvious but I couldn't really tell. I loved the actors and actresses They chose since they were just how My friends and I imagined. Even though Some parts weren't exactly like the book, they did a pretty good job reflecting it. Basically, I'm in love with this movie and plan to buy the DVD when it comes out!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Narrow screenplay leaves many confused.,"I had high expectations for this movie until I actually watched it. We are introduced to a world divided up into factions, each giving life and meaning to those who choose to be there. I had not read the book when I first saw the movie (my mistake) and found that I was completely lost through out the entire first 10 minutes of the film. The screenplay offers little to know back story and is extremely confusing to those who have never laid eyes upon Veronica Roth's series. I had to pause the movie and look up the basis of the plot before I could continue. Shailene, Theo, and Miles are all reputable actors however, once again (yes, I'm tired of saying it too) the screenplay was downright terrible and offered them little to nothing to work with. The director seemed to not grasp this and should've made changes while choosing which scenes to keep and which to cut, which was also another disappointment. We all know that you cannot condense EVERYTHING in a 300+ page novel into two hours, but they cut out some VERY pivotal scenes that could've provided a better opportunity for character development that seemed lacking. Theo being a fantastic actor seemed limited and a little two brooding or in the shadows than Four actually was in the novel. Even Miles! was outcast by some heavy-handed story telling. I am hopeful that Neil Burger will take this opportunity to up his future products, though I am glad Insurgent and Allegiant will have different directors.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hollywood perfected the teenmoneymaking formula.,"To begin with, the movie was horrible as we all expected.The thing is, that horrible movie made some serious money and proved that there is no need for new ideas and good writing for a movie to achieve that kind of gross.Why invest time and effort on a better movie when we can just modify our target audience expectations? That's why every now and then a new Mtv-like teen actor who's interviews are like audiobooks of what their managers has given them to read pops up into the movie business.The formula is now known. A teen next door who is just so random and socially awkward and can't stand mainsteam fashions and activities is globally cherished as other teens crave for someone to relate to.However, that's not a new thing. In fact it's the same thing that macho men and dynamic women represented in the 90s as well as the 80s. The thing is that those actors, because of their Hollywood persona, actually had a personality. Now teen actors have nothing that would differentiate them from one another except their face. They are just mirrors for teens to put themselves on as they have no characteristic that would not match with any of their own.That's why we end with such talentless and without personality actors, and a script that supports such characters:""A common teen like any other (THAT COULD BE YOU!) finds him/herself in a situation of him/her being different of their peers(OMG THAT'S LIKE TOTALLY HOW I FEEL!) and achieve greatness being a non conformist in a world full of conformists."" sounds familiar?Please stop paying for such movies.

Much better than similar movies,"The story is so much better than ""Hunger Games"" which I found sickeningly stupid. The more intelligent premise of Divergent is involving and you feel more for the characters. Even though the movie is long is moves a long and is well directed and well paced. The fight scenes aren't overdone which makes it convincing.The cast is likable and well cast like in Twilight. Shailene Woodley is actually good and sympathetic here seeming vulnerable and feisty at the same time. She isn't as beautiful as Lily Collins in Mortal Instruments but she is a very believable actress here. Theo James looks a bit older than her but they have good chemistry. Supporting cast is good too. Liked seeing Ashley Judd on the big screen again and she looks like she could be Shailene's mother. Maggie Q is quite a welcome presence too. Kate Winslet is suitably loathsome without overdoing it.Looking forward to the next installment.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Little Incoherent,"Divergent is a fun adventure into a world with confusing names and interesting societal rules.

Divergent (2014),"With the premise of usual young adult science fictions ""Divergent"" doesn't make something innovative as a film and with ""The Hunger Games (2012)"" releasing first it prejudices the viewers perception. It was not well structured or even flowing with emotion in my perception since it was capitalizing on more establishing the base of the story among the viewers. The dream sequence of Tris is the only aspect I find innovative. Since I never read the trilogy I may not understand what the story may have for us in the future as a franchise but the initiation of the film series is very ineffective.But it has some plus points.1. Good visuals and well cinematographic vision (Well with that kinda budget what you should question is what you can't do on the visuals).
2. Good cast and mediocre acting.(Well the new actors are pretty famous now)
3. The hype of being a futuristic-same old - post war world sequence :-pOverall - 3/5",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good movie, looking forward for the sequels","Personally, I enjoyed every minute of Divergent, although I went to see it thinking it's just another boring and predictable story with some hero guy and/or girl who kills everything around. Turned out it wasn't like that. Many around me compared it to the Hunger Games and I suppose that in some ways it resembles it, but personally I think Divergent is so much better. I honestly don't care that much about small movie mistakes, such as the wound at her ear or stuff like that. It's not those details that give the quality of a movie. The acting does and I was very pleased with the acting. It suited the subject and the atmosphere the movie tried to create. So I'm looking forward for the sequels. My only hope is that the sequels won't be boring or exaggerated, like man sequels are. This is why sequels usually suck compared to the first movie.

A disappointment,"I was hoping for something like The Hunger Games. However, the story just didn't draw me in and Woodley's acting doesn't compare to that of Jennifer Lawrence. Of course, I realize that is setting the bar really high. Maybe I expected too much.The story seemed to leave a lot of loose ends. First, I couldn't 'buy' into the concrete living quarters. It was never believable or even understandable.Second, empty trains seem to always be moving throughout the city, just ready for people to jump on.Third, the actual daily living situation of the entire city was left unshown and unexplained. Did the kids go to school? Did anyone have a 'normal' job? Were there any shops? Who, or which faction, would perform which jobs? The setting was never complete enough to make any of it 'real.' Even fantasy needs some supporting structure.Jai Courtney made his character really interesting. There was something repellent, attractive, and interesting about him all at the same time, which left me wishing we got to know his character better.All in all, it may be worth your time and money if you have few options one evening. However, don't expect something on par with The Hunger Games.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
In the faction there's too much friction,"Okay, apparently the post 2010-world likes dystopian Sci-Fi/Fantasy fables made for, and preferably starring, teenage girls. I realize I'm just an old whiner, but these nowadays dystopian stories are soft and weak compared to the terrific and similarly themed films of the 70s, like ""Soylent Green"" or ""Z.P.G"". What was the typical and almost even logical thing to do for Hollywood producers upon noticing the tremendous success of the adaptation of Suzanne Collins' ""The Hunger Games""? Find more reminiscent novels to turn into massively hyped and over-funded film franchises, of course! Neil Burger (""The Illusionist"", ""Limitless"") chose for the books written by the young author Veronica Roth. The main idea behind ""Divergent"" certainly isn't too bad. In the soulless Chicago of the near future, society is divided into five different factions that each have their own color of clothing to illustrate what type of people they are, like grey for abnegation or blue for erudite. Children are born in the factions of their parents and can remain there for the rest of their lives, or they can choose to move to one of the four other factions at the age of sixteen. There exist psychological tests to help you decide which faction suits you the best, because once you made the choice it's forbidden to change again. When the seemingly ordinary teen Beatrice takes the test, however, the outcome is ""divergent"" and this should be kept secret as divergent people are considered uncontrollable, rebellious and a menace to this formula of a peacefully structured society. Beatrice makes the instinctive but illogical choice to join the Dauntless faction, where she must battle daily to become accepted, becomes infatuated by the hunky but mysterious Four and stumbles upon a conspiracy to re-arrange the factions that looks an awful lot like genocide. As said, ""Divergent"" certainly isn't bad and even qualifies as decent entertainment on a Friday night with a bucket of popcorn and a medium-sized beer, but the script is so frustratingly unsurprising and predictable! The supposedly clever plot twists, like the dark secrets of Four or the mysterious background of Tris' mother Nathalie, are so abundantly obvious that you honestly begin to question the level of intellect of the target audience. There isn't a single thing happening in ""Divergent"" that you can't see coming from three railways stations away and, astonishingly enough, Neil Burger doesn't do anything to put his mark on the film. The action footage is very tame, clearly because the producers wanted to maintain the PG-13 rating no matter what, and the use of special effects or futuristic gimmicks is kept to a minimum, which makes you wonder on what they spent the massive $80 million budget. Perhaps on Kate Winslet's erudite haircut?",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I haven't seen something like that before !!,"First, I have watched almost all the movies of 2014 till now, and I want to say a word (only counting the ones before ""Divergent""): This is the best movie of the year till now, I haven't seen something like that movie before ! I saw some of the reviews, and I wasn't knowing that there's a book for the story !! but as they say, the movie is better, so I think I would like to see more of this, in new scenes and events, maybe new version. This movie is outstanding, I liked it and I've been interested from the beginning of the story to the end.

Divergent's Mixed Review,"Divergent opens up the series to a fantastic chapter packed with some actions and exceptionally solid performances from Shailene Woodley and the rest of the cast. But amidst all of my positive reviews, Divergent seems to not fit in the YA crowd mainly to the comparison with The Hunger Games and its futuristic style similar to The Hunger Games. Also, I personally think that Divergent lacked some action even though it had action, there wasn't enough to amuse the audiences. The interest is what makes the viewers really want to watch a film. And the themes are, again, similar to The Hunger Games and can sometimes make no sense with its plot. Divergent opens its planned trilogy to a great, but disappointingly fashion.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Surprisingly Enjoyable,"I really didn't expect much from this movie. However, I was surprised to find that it was actually enjoyable.I have a love-hate relationship with the divided factions idea. As cool as it was, it wasn't done very well. Everyone wore the same clothes, or was at least color-coded, which looked very goofy and unrealistic. Although it is the future, so who knows how people will dress then. However, the factions idea, although not particularly original, was cool and each faction was realistically divided nonetheless.The acting was okay. Shailene Woodley (Tris) didn't do a particularly good job, but it was good enough. Theo James (Four) did better, but his character felt somewhat flat. I'm not sure if that was his acting or just the character himself.The characters weren't super well-developed, but somehow I actually cared about the five main ones by the end. Some of the expendables that died didn't affect me, but major character deaths and challenges were somewhat sad, but not sad enough to strike up any tears or serious emotion. The relationship between Tris and Four felt very forced and it was awkward to watch them later on in the movie. It felt like it came out of nowhere, considering the age difference. Thankfully, these exchanges very rarely happened.Divergent was enjoyable, and set itself up for a better trilogy than movies like the Hunger Games did, only this movie received more hate for some reason (Divergent is better than Hunger Games). With decent acting, good characters, an interesting story, and a good ending, I'm certainly going to see Insurgent. Having not read the book, I probably didn't notice certain flaws that others did, but as a movie I enjoyed it. Overall, Divergent is worth-watching, but its far from amazing. If your looking for something entertaining to watch, then look no further than Divergent.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"The movie was great, just didn't follow the book that well.","If you have not read the book, the movie will probably seem pretty good. A few of the fights were a little cliché, but it is still an overall good movie.My second point I direct to a person's whose username is ELSIDALIAJ. You cannot review a movie if you walked out in the first 20 minutes of it you fool. You obviously missed key parts of the movie that apparently confused your trivial little mind. The trains don't stop for a reason you uncultured swine. The people jump on the train because they are DAUNTLESS. There entire faction's purpose is to be brave. They climb up to the train because it is brave. Read the book or at least watch the movie before you open your foolish mouth about how stupid it is. Furthermore the Dauntless run everywhere and made loud noises because that's who they are. It's part of their character.

Harry Potter in the future,"The film is well done and all the actors are playing OK. That's about all I can say that it good about the movie. The script, though, is terrible. Basically it is about a bored little Amish girl who decides to switch Factions and join the Fascists, just for fun. The faction system is a sort of Hogwarts house system, only people are separated by more clear virtues which somehow need to preclude any others, for no good reason. The training is just like in Harry Potter, seemingly controlled, but actually quite insane. This system is threatened by divergents, people who have characteristics from more than one faction and that ""the system"" wants them destroyed. Guess which one is she.Anyway, the movie does possess a subtle irony that I believe was unintentional. A brainwashing movie made for masses of young adults is advocating rebellion against a brainwashing system. Of course, only do that after you trusted the system most of the time and obeyed without question, then found out something so outrageous about it that your only alternatives are fight or die. And I am still not sure whether some part of the film didn't advocate death as a good alternative to resistance. I mean, she had to be really weird and rare in order to do that, so that means the rest of them had no chance to begin with.Bottom line: I felt cheated of more than two hours of my life and offended by the radically dumb message of the story. They fight the system, they win, and still they end up running. And do you know the crazy bitch that started it all? They let her live at the end. Because they are good guys. Sheesh!

Where Outcasts Have to Hide to Protect Themselves,"Based on the wildly successful novel by Veronica Roth, ""Divergent"" tells the story of teens struggling to find their place in post-war Chicago. Society is separated by factions based on personality traits and virtues in attempts to keep the peace and encourage the population to participate equally in maintaining a functioning community. When a person turns 16, she takes a test to determine what faction best suits her characteristics to help her decide whether she should stay in her home faction or move elsewhere. Tris, played by Shailene Woodley, is a modest girl from Abnegation, but her entire life is turned upside down when the test reveals something about her she didn't know was possible. She is a Divergent, which means she does not fit into any category, therefore cannot be controlled and is a threat to the system. With the advice of an older faction member, she is warned not to tell a soul or her life will be at risk. Young Tris then decides to leave her home of Abnegation and transfer to Dauntless, a fiery group of individuals that show no fear and protect the people. There, she has to learn to fit in and test herself physically and mentally, all the while guarding a dark secret.I really like this film. I went into it not knowing anything about the book trilogy so I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but I was pleased with the outcome. The visuals are interesting because even though this film is set in the future and it features some advanced technology, everything is kept quite simple looking. There are, however, some flaws with the visuals and effects because at times it is very apparent that green screen is in use. The soundtrack is absolutely incredible. It features a variety of artist that I really enjoy and I've already downloaded music from the film because it is something I actually listen to on a daily basis which isn't the case with me for most motion picture soundtracks.My favorite character is surprisingly not one of the leads, but a supporting role. I like the character Will, played by Ben Lloyd-Hughes, who is a boy Tris meets during her training in Dauntless. Will is a sweet, kind-hearted person who is always very supportive of Tris and her friend Christina, played by Zoe Kravitz. He is very level headed and is someone you can always count on. I had the pleasure of meeting Ben Lloyd-Hughes and I think he is perfect for the role of Will. The rest of the cast works very well together. Shailene Woodley does a great job portraying her emotions and showing Tris's character development. She goes through quite a lot over the course of the film and Shailene is really able to embody Tris and show how she transforms from a timid, modest Abnegation, to a fearless young woman who is not defined by anyone or anything. The only problem I have with the casting is that Four, played by Theo James, is supposed to be 18 in the book series. However in the film, he appears to be in his mid 20's, since Theo is 29 years old. He does a wonderful job playing his character, but it makes the romance between him and Tris really uncomfortable.My favorite scene in the film is when Tris and the rest of the new members of Dauntless are heading back from playing a capture the flag like war game. They each strap up to a high-speed full body zip line that goes rocketing through the empty city. I think this scene is visually appealing even though it is very short and has really no importance to the film. The CGI and landscape in this scene is just well done.Since I have not read this trilogy, I was a little let down with certain aspects of the film. In ""Divergent"" the film, the whole movie is mainly Tris training in Dauntless and it feels like the plot takes far too long to develop. The last 15-20 minutes of the film is where the action and the conflict begin to happen and then the movie is over. I found out that this is how the first book is written as well, but as someone who has very little prior knowledge of the series, it seems a bit odd. The second thing that threw me off was that it seems as if quite a bit of the dialogue is taken directly from the book. This is something that fans of the book will love since the films stays so true to the novel. However, from my point of view, a lot of the dialogue does not translate very well to the screen and appears a bit cheesy and forced at times. Like I said, this is really only an issue for me since I have not read the series nor was I a fan prior to watching the film. Overall, I was entertained despite these points.I recommend this film for ages 12 to 18 or for anyone who has read the novel. The movie gets a bit violent during training scenes and towards the end but is nothing too bad and if you've read the books you know what to expect. Overall I give Divergent 4 out of 5 stars because it is entertaining and I'm already eager for the next installment in the series. Plus I and all my friends that saw the film have been quoting the movie non-stop and making ""Divergent"" references in almost every conversation, so it clearly left its mark on us!

Not Bad of Its Type,"Another 'Young Adult' sci-fi action romance flick. As with all the others, let me state upfront I haven't read the books on which this is based, nor do I intend to. I don't have any knowledge of spoilers from the books. I'll just assume the movie follows them for the most part but changes some things here or there. That's usually the case. At any rate, without having read the books, I can say this movie is not as original as it seems to believe it is. It borrows liberally from several sources. Among them is Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World."" But most of it is just following the predictable YA formula. Young woman, pretty but not intimidatingly so, is the 'chosen one' to change the world or some such. Along the way she falls in love with a guy who's just too dreamy for words. It's funny how in these things the girl is always supposed to be something of a plain Jane but the guy has to be a heartthrob. I'm sure someone has written about the hypocrisy of that since men are always criticized for being shallow and thinking about looks first with regards to women...but I digress.The cast does well, with Shailene Woodley (one of Hollywood's much-hyped rising stars of late) doing a fine job. Theo James only has to look handsome so it's to his credit he can actually act. Kate Winslet plays the obligatory corrupt government leader villain. I assume she was paid well. Ashley Judd and eyebrowless Tony Goldwyn play Woodley's parents. Thankless roles for both, really. The performance I enjoyed the most was Zoë Kravitz as Woodley's friend. Sadly, she largely disappears in the second half of the movie. Anyway, there no impressive action sequences or special effects to speak of. It's not that what's there is bad, just that nothing stood out to me. After the movie was over, I didn't say ""Wow remember that scene"" or anything like that. Still, I don't regret watching it and I will likely watch the inevitable sequels. As far as these types of movies go, it was decent.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Target,"Are you the target audience? Are you female, possibly still a teenager? If you answer yes to both questions and will most likely also have read the book (I haven't), than the answer to what you think of this, is likely to be different from mine. Still I watched this with a female friend of mine and she was much ruder than me, when it came to evaluate the movie.It is a different take on the Hunger Games I reckon, though I have no idea what the time-line is on those books. The whole idea about classes and deciding your own fate is the backbone and the one thing that sort of works here. What does not work is the ""love story"", again reducing teenage girls into messes who want to be treated as bad as possible, to fall in love with that ""hard shell, soft heart"" kinda person. It's like the more the guy pushes her off, the more she wants him.We also get the clichés we expect to see.

Divergent: The convergence of other YA adaptations,"An adaptation of a bestseller by Veronica Ruth, Divergent is a dystopian YA novel where the population is split into factions based on their attributes. The five factions are: Abnegation, the pious; Erudite, the smart ones; Amity, the peace lovers; Candor, the honest, and Dauntless, the brave ones who are in essence the city's police.Our heroine is Tris, who joins Dauntless after the being brought up by her parents in Abnegation. This is after tests are conducted (think Hogwarts Sorting Hat) to determine which faction candidates would be best suited to, and hers are revealed to be- as you can work out from the title- Divergent i.e. having attributes from multiple factions. The factions have been set up to retain order in the city and thus, ""Divergents"" undermine the system and must be eliminated. I can't fully get on-board with this idea though as I find it puzzling that the vast majority of the population can have just one attribute. What's stopping one from being- God forbid- smart *and* peace-loving? Dauntless also spend a lot of the time jumping around and being a parody of parkour enthusiasts.The social commentary is weak in comparison to the Hunger Games and it borrows narrative elements from the superior Ender's Game. However it leaves just enough intrigue to make me want to return for the next in the series.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Despite the sparse context and weak visuals, Divergent has fun with the good action scenes and with the gradual increase in the difficulty that Tris must face","The world of Divergent is curious. In the opening minutes, Tris (Shailene Woodley) explains to the viewer that, in the not too distant future, the city of Chicago is destroyed and the residents were divided into factions, according to their qualities and choices: Selflessness, composed of altruists, current leaders; Dauntless, for the brave who act as policemen; Friendship, for the affectionate (and dressed like hippies); Candor, for those who speak only the truth; and Erudition, formed by intellectuals (and who may be plotting a coup d'état).Those who do not fit into any of the groups become homeless. But at the age of 16, the destiny can be much worse: those who fall into more than one of the factions are called divergent, hunted, imprisoned and even killed. But how did this separation occur? Nobody protested at the beginning? What was there before the division? Why are these five factions, and not others? The division system accounts for professions such as farmers (Amity), lawyers (Erudite) and guards (Dauntless), but where are the doctors, the artists? What do those of Candor do? It is not known. Perhaps the book explains this social and historical context well, but the film does not provide explanations.Disobedience, then, is something that is expected of teenagers, like any rite of passage. A bestseller among young people, Divergent embraces in a painless and behaved way (the only real break in Beatrice's life is also expected and obligatory, farewell to parents) the idea that the world is a place to be physically explored. Extreme sports and games are at the heart of that experience in the film, and while there is a minimal sense of threat - deaths are considerably more shocking in The Hunger Games - it is inevitable to see the heroine's journey in this film as a ride through an amusement park.Evan Daugherty, newcomer who wrote the script for Snow White and the Hunter, adapted with Vanessa Taylor the futuristic plot that runs, in good measure, as an American high school story, varnishing the mandatory division of groups in the cafeteria (nerds, athletes, patricinhas etc. here they just change their name), with the right to flirt between one burger and another. The screenwriters little explore the relationships between their characters with themselves and between them, failing to get the basics, which is to give the audience reason to care about the fate of those figures. Even the initial premise of the franchise is used minimally and ends up being almost neglected in favor of a novel pushed down to the audience.Based on the success of The Hunger Games saga, it was only a matter of time before another plot appeared in the cinemas that referred to a dark and totalitarian future. However, Divergent is inferior in terms of the Katniss Everdeen saga in terms of visual effects and art direction. The Hunger Games presented a boldness for costumes and sets that the world of Tris does not dare to imagine. The futuristic scene in Chicago is very minimalist, as if the future did not bring many aesthetic changes in relation to the present (or as if art directors had a reduced budget to work). Abnegation residents are known for their vow of poverty, but the other factions have similarly simple clothes and visual identities. Perhaps the greatest example of little visual inventiveness is Jeanine Matthews' (Winslet) costume, which should represent power, authority and coolness, but looks just like any executive. However, what takes a little interest out of the film are some (dozens) of poor dialogues, which may not even need to be in the script.As for the plot itself, The Hunger Games removes the structure of young people who fight among themselves to select the strongest - to impose a logic of bread and circus, in the case of Katniss's story, and by self-imposition of the young people themselves, in the case of the violent internal rules of Dauntless. Both governments are tyrannical, but Divergent's seems more perverse, since the residents themselves have assimilated the rules and started to reproduce the logic of extermination on their own. As for the script, it's a shame that the surprising amount of twists and turns in Divergent ends up sacrificing tension. Important moments such as Dauntless tests, or Tris' aptitude test are revealed without any suspense, without scenes of anticipation. When the tests start, Tris is always one of the first to participate, enters the room quickly and does what she has to do. If he had more time or more attention to the pace, the director would be able to build a claustrophobic atmosphere - which The Hunger Games achieved most successfully in its gaming arena.The film loses a little of its potential when it does not free itself and the ordinary. The novel inserted in the story proves to be potentially distracting. The construction of the main character is interesting and the show is becoming strong and fearless, but the possibility of this being eclipsed by her relationship with the character Four is strong. Thus, the message loses power in the face of the romantic ending that the character may or may not have. The need to serve larger audiences is stronger than the message that it is possible to be different and that there is no mistake in that.Another failure was to structure the film in such a way that moments lost due importance. We see the character entering various situations of overcoming and challenging throughout the film, but the last challenges and overcoming are superficial and frivolous, not receiving much attention or even generating consequences for the character. In its struggle to free itself from the motto ""faction before the blood"" the film ends up taking the character away from the colon, in addition to simplistic resolutions at certain times and total detachment with characters and their deaths.Divergent has some advantages over the other franchises mentioned. There are many more scenes of action, combat, more blood and more training that Tris must go through. The script calmly accompanies the girl's improvement in the art of war - unlike Katniss, she has no innate talent before entering the ""games"", in this case, the training. The training pace is good, convincing, and Shailene Woodley is able to cope with the character's complexity, especially in times of tension, such as fear scenarios and knife testing. Director Neil Burger's camera constantly focuses on the actress's face, showing that the director knows where the biggest weight of the film resides. But, considering the violent universe in which Tris gets involved in choosing the Dauntless faction, Neil Burger's cowardice in showing the consequences of the training (and, later, of the military actions) perpetrated by the group, greatly minimizes the impact of these scenes. It is not about glorifying violence, but about showing more seriously its physical and emotional consequences, something that ""Hunger Games"", produced by the same Lionsgate / Summit has done so well. Some deaths that occur during the projection do not have the dramatic resonance that is required of them, because director Neil Burger seems to want to spare the audience any more uncomfortable emotions. Moments of tension, fear and excitement are present throughout the plot, but the often static camera dissolves part of what we should feel during these scenes, which then must only depend on the performance of the actors, who save at times.Overall, Neil Burger - the same as No Limits with Bradley Cooper - should be able to please fans and also those who are unaware of the books. Although not daring visually, limited to filming his characters up close and creating great aerial shots of the futuristic city (which reveal the limitation of special effects), Burger knew how to explore certain elements of the story, such as the half-destroyed city of Chicago, which it served to dictate the tone that the film needed. Neil still changed the end of the film a little, differentiating it from the original version (but not much) which ended up creating a very interesting outcome. The soundtrack, produced by none other than Hans Zimmer in partnership with Junkie XL and Ellie Goulding, is simply sensational and fits very well with all the scenes.Even so, Divergent has fun with the good action scenes and with the gradual increase in the difficulty that Tris must face. It is also worth highlighting the protagonist's simple and punctual romance with leader Four, without excessive love scenes. Despite the sparse context and weak visuals, the film managed to fulfill the two biggest challenges it faced: including as much of the story as possible in the script while maintaining its loyalty, to please the fans of the book, and explaining the minimal bases of the story, to those who still don't know the work of Veronica Roth. Despite having a slow pace (it's 2h20 of film), Divergent's script does not compromise by giving time for the story to be told smoothly (although a 15 or 20-minute edition would do the plot well). And, of course, there are hooks for the sequels, since the film is the first in a trilogy. The tip is to enter the room without waiting too long and leave satisfied after the session with a film that fulfills its goal: entertaining the audience. What is already more than could be imagined in a plot that, at first, seems to be a mixture of so many copies aimed at teenagers and launched on screens in recent years.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It's like Hunger Games' training plus Inception's dream share plus Facing one's fears; add a little romance and mystery to it, you have 'Divergent'.

And it had one of the most predictable plots ever. The other futuristic movie released this year with the theme of maintaining peace, 'The Giver', was just ninety minutes long but had better performances and was a bit different than the usual.Divergent is actually the first part in its book trilogy, but compared to other young-adult futuristic trilogies like 'The Hunger Games' and 'The Maze Runner', this didn't have much going for it, and even if the remaining two books get adapted, I'm not that interested to follow them.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

One Choice Can Transform You,"The United States of America is not what we once knew – the nation was split and the government was run out by factions – 5 to be exact: Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless and Erudite.

One faction the Erudite comes in and destroys the peaceful nation by catapulting a ruthless attempt to rid the world of Divergents and the overrule the government so they can get their way with the leadership of one woman – Jeanine Matthews (played beautifully by Kate Winslet.) I don't want to spoil the rest of the movie for the people who have not seen the movie but I will say this – this movie was lacking in some places where things were left unsaid, action was left out and things were changed up a bit.This movie was an awesome way of letting dive into a young writers mind of how she sees the world, Veronica Roth who at the time was 23 when she wrote this book. The book was action packed and so was the movie, matter of fact the movie was incredible.

Pass the Popcorn! review,"Divergent is yet another bestselling novel I've never heard about, and part of yet another young adult trilogy, by yet another female writer (Veronica Roth) I've, again, never heard about. Also, this is yet another movie I would never have watched, had I not had to write this blog – basically because it looks awful, boring and unoriginal. Before I turn this into a rant against this newest fashion everyone seems to be crazy about, I'll talk about the movie. Divergent is probably best summed up in an anecdote: while trying to point out the difference between The Hunger Games and Divergent, the latter's director Neil Burger started explaining what it was about – and his explanation could have easily been applied to both movies. Ironically, Divergent hails individuality while being a copycat itself.Divergent is set in a post-apocalyptic Chicago, where people are divided in five factions, depending on their virtues: the Erudite are smart, the Amity are kind, the Candor honest, the Dauntless brave and the Abnegation selfless. Beatrice (Shailene Woodley) and her family are Abnegation, but she and her brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) have to take the aptitude test to determine which faction they truly belong to. Beatrice's results are inconclusive, she's dubbed Divergent and must keep this secret. Eventually, she chooses the Dauntless faction and starts a difficult training after which the weakest ones will be cast out and become factionless – all the while, hiding her true, Divergent nature, as Divergents are being hunt down and killed.Surprisingly, Divergent didn't turn out to be as bad as I thought it would be. It might be because the director is Neil Burger, who also directed Limitless and The Illusionist, which are good movies. Also, the acting isn't bad, although, sometimes, somewhat underwhelming. This applies especially to Kate Winslet, who plays the 'bad girl' in the movie, the Erudite Jeanine – and the fact that she's bad is evident from the first moment she's on screen, just because she's cold and falsely kind. Her character isn't developed any further, she remains irritatingly perfect, as if that was enough to make a good villain. But in this case, the problem is mostly of the screenwriters – and probably the novelist, who created the interesting setting and faction system, but didn't exploit their potential fully or elaborate them enough to avoid plot holes and inconsistencies.As I mentioned before, the movie reminds much of The Hunger Games, but I don't see that as the movie's (or the book's) bad quality. What surprises me is that, after all those silly young adult flicks we've had and still have, people and mostly teenagers are, once again, interested in the same old story – just check out Divergent's box office results. The market is saturated and it's extremely difficult to create a new YA series that will be truly good anymore. Divergent (the movie, but I doubt the book is better, at least story-wise) isn't good: it's predictable, filled with clichés, boring, too long, unoriginal and so on. And still, the book came out and it was a success, and the movie came out and was a success, too – and this will most likely happen to all the other similar novels and movies that will be published in the future. I can only say, if you want to get rich fast, just write a teen love story, with a wannabe social commentary, not set on out planet and/or in our time, and you're guaranteed to succeed.Rating: 5/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Fantastic Movie,"This movie is absolutely fantastic. Shailene is phenomenal as the lead role Tris. She embodied the character perfectly and made me tear up on several occasions. Although this movie is relatively long, it didn't seem like it. Each scene was important in the story and action packed. Kate Winslet was able to evoke a very intelligent character in the way she portrayed a person who, although we think is evil, really believes in what she's doing. The only negative critique I would have on this movie is that, having never read the books, the other characters were not developed as much and it was hard knowing who was who. This isn't a girl falls in love with boy kind of movie, it is strong and brave and never ceased in action.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Die-Vergenmt,"10 out of 10 stars because it was a great movie.Why I love Divergent because its great and its a great story because it teaches you to be different is OK and you have people there for you and you are strong no matter what your size is and how to be kind,brave,honesty,smart,selfless.I loved how the actors and actresses were perfect for their part. I loved how they kept the same parts from the book and didn't change their order. I loved how dramatic it was and how much action there was.The only thing I didn't like was that they cut out some parts.This is a great movie because of the action. the people who are in this movie are Tris (Shailene Woodley) Four/ Tobias (Theo James) Eric (Jai Courtney) Tori (Maggie Q) Jeanine (Kate Winslet) are the main people we are going to be talking about.People who would like this are people who like Twilight , The Hunger Games, Catching Fire and action movies with like a little romance to it.The good thing is about not having all the parts from the book is that they can make the plot better and spend more time and money on that rather than the other parts in the book.The plot is that Tris and Four (Tobias) are Divergent so Eric injected a serum in both of them but it didn't work on them because they were Divergent they were trying to blend in they were going to war against Abnegation The Faction they were from and since it didn't work on them Eric tried to kill Four but he didn't know he was Divergent but Triss shot Eric in the ankle so then they figured out that they were Divergent and caught them and brought them to Jeanine. She want to kill all the Divergent but she made a serum and it only worked on Four and because she wanted to kill Tris but she didn't get killed because her mom saved her and she also saved Four.Overall this movie is great you should watch itI still think it is 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Best movie so far this year. It's a MUST SEE. I do not regret a thing.,"The Review: Normally I avoid reviewing movies due to the fact I suck at it, and I tend to give away spoilers. For DIVERGENT I'm going to try and give a quick review on what I loved, and not going to go scene by scene like people would normally do.There is only one word that describes the whole movie for me, and that is-EPIC! Best movie of 2014 so far. I want to go see it again, and again. You could tell the director and actors put a lot of effort into the movie, and it paid off wonderfully.I thought since Summit Entertainment was doing the production then it would suck and regrettably stupid just like TWILIGHT but surprisingly they did an amazing job with the movie. There was a lot of action, a cheesy romantic scene, and a few kisses here and there but overall the action-pack made up for it.Characters- The actors true to their word, stuck to the book characters as much as any person could, and as much as I wished it could have I really wanted Tris to be attacked just like in the books but it turned out a bit differently as I thought it would be.Now everyone's question was it like the book? When a book turns into a movie, they can't stick chapter by chapter to the book, sorry, I know it's horrible but it's the truth, it stuck maybe 20% of the book, but you couldn't really tell that it was skimmed over, it was that good.Music-The soundtrack is amazing, and I haven't stopped listening to it since I bought it. One of my favorite songs on the track is Ellie Goulding's song Beating Heart.Overall DIVERGENT is a movie that is action packed, suspenseful, and a pinch of romance movie that is a 2014 Best movie so far this year. It's a MUST SEE. I do not regret a thing.Rating: 5 Plus Stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Disappointing if you've read the book, dull if you haven't.","Recently went to see this movie, having been a big fan of the book. Dystopian stories are something I find fascinating. That being said, this is very reminiscent of a futuristic version of Hunger Games. Strong female protagonist from a group not looked upon highly. Said protagonist takes a huge chance, which in The Hunger Games eventually leads to her fighting corrupt government...not a spoiler, because I'm not saying anything about Divergent. If it's the exact same plot that's not my fault.And nothing is wrong with them having extremely similar plots. It's how the directors go about it. The grit and grunge of a dystopian world can be done well. This movie, however, did not do so. Many of the darker instances of the book that help truly develop the characters lack intensity in the movie, if they're in at all. The dialog is stilted; it's how many people write their first story. ""Instead of me writing what's happening and why, I'll just have my characters blatantly say it.""The only thing that gives this movie any saving grace are the actors portraying these roles. You hate the bad ones, you love the good ones. Their acting cannot save the dialog. Or story. Or set design. Or the soundtrack many other reviewers have been raving about. If you want the soundtrack just go buy an Elie Goulding CD.On the whole, not worth seeing in theaters. It's an entertaining plot that is toned down for mass appeal. Too much is shoved in. There are many scenes that should be shortened, and a select few that should be lengthened.If you read the books, you'll enjoy the movie. If you're under the age of 15. Even then, you'll be noticing the disappointment in Woodley's eyes as she realizes this film is mediocre at best. It seems like a young Veronica Roth got excited to see her name on the big screen and gladly sold out to make a relatively family friendly movie, following the teenage rebellion girl trend, despite the fact that the entire concept of the book is that Tris is different.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"What Makes You Different Makes You Dangerous in ""Divergent""","I don't understand the hate on this film. Not loyal on the book? Well, I think some changes, additions, and omissions have to be made to fit a novel for a full-feature film. Clichéd young-adult movies? What do you call the Marvel movies then? I'm gonna review this for what I've seen. I'll be fair to judge this on its content, not on loyalty or formula.In ""Divergent"", Tris grows up in a world where society is divided into five faction based on virtues. She discovers to be a Divergent, not fitting to only one faction. Her seemingly utopian world becomes a dystopian one. This film is very relatable to audiences ages 13-21. This is the stage where we wanna know where we belong and what we wanna do with our lives. The Faction System is a thought-provoking idea. What if you'll value faction over blood? Friends over family? I love the world-building invested on Abnegation (selfless), Dauntless (brave), and Erudite (smart). I love the action scenes. I'm impressed with Shailene Woodley and Theo James's athleticism to perform most of their stunts. I love how the plot runs.

A rip-off of a rip-off?,"DIVERGENT is another in a long line of recent Hollywood 'young adult' movies, inevitably based on long-running book series and designed to cash in on the same market as the TWILIGHT saga or the HARRY POTTER franchise. This one's almost exactly the same as THE HUNGER GAMES, featuring a dystopian future world (is there any other type?) split into five different factions. Teenagers must choose a faction in which to live for the rest of their lives.Yes, it's exactly like somebody watched or read the first Harry Potter film/novel, decided that the whole sorting hat thing was a cool motif and that they could write a whole book series with it applied to real life. Unfortunately, that opening plot point is the only thing this film has going for it, as the rest of it is mere set-up. We watch characters interacting, getting to know one another, and training - lots and lots of TRAINING - for over two hours before an action narrative sort of hits in the last half hour.The lack of incident and completely predictability of what's taking place on screen - we've been through all this training stuff before in the first two HUNGER GAMES movies and it was boring then - make DIVERGENT a real chore to sit through. I don't know why these films have to have such lengthy running times and so much exposition when all of the stuff we see could have been depicted in a mere half an hour with a handful of pithy moments instead of endless self-indulgence and stretched-out moments. CGI training sequences are not something I enjoy watching.What I did like about DIVERGENT is that it has decent characterisation for once, much better than in the Jennifer Lawrence franchise. Shailene Woodley is a decent young actress and completely sympathetic in the lead role, and newcomer Theo James makes an impact as her mentor. The supporting cast features the impressive likes of Jai Courtney, Ray Stevenson, and Tony Goldwyn, alongside more minor bits for Kate Winslet and Maggie Q, and overall the calibre of the acting is strong. It's just a shame that there's no story to go with the characters; I can accept and enjoy well-plotted movies without characterisation, but a film with good characters and no plot is doomed from the outset. We'll see where the sequels go with this...",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Little did I know.The basic idea of the movie: We live in a post-war world, where people are divided into factions, based on virtues. As young adults, they got to chose which one they want to join. Surprise surprise, we find ""divergents"", people that don't fit into the system and are threatening its existence. They are chased and killed in a totalitarian system. Sounds familiar? I hope so, otherwise you have missed lots of movies in the last decades. The last one I have seen was ""Upside Down"", and it wasn't a great movie either, but it is so much better. And it has only a score of 6.4, I just really don't understand that.There's really not much to say about the movie itself. Lots of martial arts and gunfights, some kind of a love story, political intrigue. Characters without faces, intentions without sense, a movie without a justification for existence.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Divergent For Life,"Rating out of 10: 10 stars **********Notes to remember for the review Great actors Great story line Amazing costumes Awesome special effectsPros (Good things / what I loved) They chose good actors for the parts They used good emotions The special effectsCons (Bad things / what I didn't like), and how would you improve on it (next steps) The only thing I didn't like was that they left out some parts from the bookIntroduction Divergent takes place in the future and after the war the country is divided in factions. There are 5 factions Abnegation (the selfless) Candor (the honest) Erudite (the intelligent) Amtiy (the peaceful) and Dauntless (the brave). Tris is the main character she is divergent the government doesn't like divergent because they think that they will try to take over the country.Evidence This is a action movie and it's sort of like the Hunger Games. The main characters are Triss (Shailene Woodley) Four/Tobias (Thoe James) Jeanine (Kate Winslet) Tori (Maggie Q) and Eric (Jai Courtney). You would like to watch this movie if you like the Hunger Games, Catching Fire and action movies. Also if you liked the book you will probably like the movie. This movie is about Tris who is divergent she goes to Dauntless but she finds out that Jeanine is trying to take over the government controlling the dauntless people and making them kill the abnegation people Tris and Four are Divergent so Eric and Jeanine can't control them but hey have to pretended or they will be killed. In the end Tris and Four stop Eric and Jeanine!Conclusion I think that Divergent is an amazing movie and I can't wait to see the next two!Rating out of 5:I still think it's 10****** Stars",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Divergent film of the year!,"An absolutely excellent film! I knew from the trailer that it would be good, It blew me away. As soon as the film ended i wanted to watch it again and again So i decided to go out and buy all of the three of the books which were equally as amazing!Shailene Woodley and Theo James have got great chemistry and we can see that they share this chemistry on and off screen, you can also tell that they are both talented actors and have had years of experience in the film industry. I cant wait to watch all of the Divergent trilogy because if they are as amazing as Divergent is i will be hooked, well i am hooked. All round i gave this film a ten as it is both romantic and action packed. 100% i would recommend this film to people of all ages.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Bad casting. Bad acting.,"First, I didn't read the book. Whatever you will read in this review comes purely from a perspective of a film practitioner and ordinary movie fanatic.The wrong choice of actors made the film looks bad. The characters, especially the main characters, were not convincing even Kate Winslet and Ashley Judd. The facial reactions, the delivery of the dialogues! arggghhh!!!The story is obviously inspired from Hunger games. Maybe some of the viewer's will deny it, but no no no! I think the idea is somehow related to Hunger games!Pacing is good. Somehow it also made me laugh with some scenes but mostly I laughed because of, I think, disappointment!!! >:/the soundtrack is also not good, even the timing of musical score... it doesn't have rhythm! @_@I don't know, maybe if they only have good characters, and a good screenplay...maybe it will separate them from comparing to Hunger games.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Very Fun Film,"I've been reading reviews on this website for a while and I've seen some overly harsh judgments in the past...but nothing like what people are typing up about this film...so lets address the movie first.Divergent is an underdog story about learning to stand up for who you are and fight back against a society that is constantly trying to shove you into a box...Its a great film, one I highly recommend.Now on to the complaints The first ""studios are always looking for the next hunger games or the twilight saga and this is just another attempt..."" So your argument about this movie is because studios are trying to produce good successful movies...got it...they should only make crap indie films makes total sense to me now (maybe you should just stop going to the movies...maybe just not watch TV)The Second ""It was nothing like the book they butchered the book"" um..grow up...if you love the book then read it again this movie doesn't change how great the book is...did I scream and complain about how Man of Steel wasn't exactly like the comics...NO! GET OVER IT!The Third ""It was a sappy underwritten love story with nothing but build up and shallow casting"" I'm not sure what movie you saw...Divergent was a great film that had none of those issues.Lastly...Don't listen to people, heck don't listen to me! just go see the film and decide for yourself.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Divergent Best Movie Review,"Divergent is a movie about a young girl, Beatrice (Shailene Woodley), who lives in the dystopian future. In this world, when people are sixteen, they take a test, which assigns them to one of five factions where they will live for the rest of their lives. Beatrice's test results are inconclusive, and she decides to go live in the Dauntless, or the brave faction. In this faction she meets many new friends. She also meets Four (Theo James), who is the faction leader, and falls in love with him. Beatrice, or Tris (her new name) then discovers a plan made by another faction leader, Jeanine (Kate Winslet), to take over the government and kill many innocent people. This causes her to go on a journey with Four, who she is unsure if she can trust, to stop Jeanine.This movie is filled with splendid acting, realistic visuals, and a twisting and unpredictable plot. Shailene Woodley, who plays the main role, does an incredible job playing a character that has not found out where she belongs and has to lie to survive. It is also filled with realistic visuals, such as Four and Beatrice climbing about 300ft in the air to the top of a Ferris wheel and looking down over a futuristic city. Another effect is when the main character glides through this futuristic city and past tall buildings on a zip line. These realistic effects make the viewer feel as if they have been transported into the movie.The unpredictable plot makes this movie somewhat hard to follow for people who have not read the book. There was so much that happened in the book and the movie that made it hard for the viewer to understand what was happening. This movie may cause some viewers to ask questions, such as ""Where did this woman come from"", ""Where are they now,"" or ""Who is this?"" Another reason that many viewers may have questions is because this plot is shrouded in mystery. Many of the characters reveal their backstory and how they tie into the plot at the end of the movie, so do not worry. I felt like there were a lot of unnecessary training scenes; however, these scenes were nice because they provided action to the movie. This was a long movie, lasting two hours, however, it went by extremely fast because of how much action was in it.Another thing that I thought I was going to be disappointed with was how similar the plot was to the Hunger Games. Both of these stories are set in a dystopian future with a government who is disliked by many common people, which causes the people to rebel. However, Divergent puts a new and fresh spin on it. Instead of the government being the bad thing, it is a woman that wants to take over the government, who must be stopped. The villain, or antagonist, was a woman, which made the film seem different than others in its genre. One thing that might deter some people is the amount of violence in the movie. There are many scenes, which contain fighting, knives, and blood.I recommend this movie to anyone interested in an action movie with a new, fresh plot idea. I think that it might have been slightly better if I had read the book because it would eliminate some of the confusion. However, it is still fun movie to watch even if you have not read the book, since it is filled with spectacular acting and visuals, along with an unpredictable, surprising plot.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Almost got asleep, my 7 years old daughter asked me what is happening on the screen and I could not even describe it, not because she is 7 years but because this movie is total bull-... It is childish but pretends to be adult, there is no sense or anything worth watching or seeing. I have no idea why it was so advertised to be equal to Hunger Games...

Another Good Franchise Starter!,"To be quite frank, I enjoyed Divergent. I tried to read the book, but I was never able to finish reading the book. The movie is a better movie than I thought. I honestly don't get the comparisons between this and the Hunger Games other than the dystopian futures and a strong, female protagonist. They are both different stories and I enjoy each movie for different reasons. This movie doesn't feature strong romance and I like the fact how there are factions based off virtues, which I find intriguing. There are some cool action scenes and I also enjoyed the pretty effective visuals.Neil Burger's film is about a girl named Tris Prior who was assigned to the Dauntless faction, or pretty much the army of the city. She has a dark secret in which she is divergent, or the ability to have all virtues. The government has a plan to wipe out all Divergents and Tris, along with the mysterious Four, must figure out why and how to stop them.I believe that the cast did an excellent job. Shailene Woodley is a good, young actress and she played her role very well. Theo James actually made for a good Four and of course all the girls would be all over him. Jai Courtney, whom was bad in the last adaptation of Die Hard, delivers a stronger performance as the leader of Dauntless. Kate Winslet gives a malicious performance as the head government leader. Other standouts include Miles Teller and Ashley Judd.Overall, Divergent is the beginning of what seems to be another profitable, young-adult franchise. I love the nature of the film and it is a better movie than book, which is often very rare. I was able to understand the concepts, thus making me more appreciative of them. Is this the best young-adult movie? Of course not, but I regard highly the value of it being fun and entertaining. I cannot way to see this story continue.My Grade: A-",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A fast-pace failure,"If it were not for the few action scenes and the obvious will for the unknown part of the cast to finally break trough in Hollywood, this rating would have easily been a 2.Divergent has been the online hype for the past six months, and there is honestly nothing that stands up to whatever buzz it has created. It is a demoralizing vulgarization of master pieces like 'A Brave New World'. Except it has been very unfortunately mixed with 'Twilight', 'The Hunger Games', and that it now lies somewhere between bad and worst.To think that experienced and successful actresses like Kate Winslet and Ashley Judd signed in to co-star with a whole bunch of TV stars - mostly big screen wannabees - on the basis of such a terrible scenario is pretty self-explanatory in itself: Divergent has only one objective, and that is to create a cash cow like the other recent teenage franchises.It could be called sad, but in the end, there is nothing wrong with doing money. The only problem nowadays is that poor writers just loot their plots from inspiring master pieces from the past. With Divergent, Hollywood keeps on being Culture's Tomb Raider.Actually, it is sad.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Brilliant performances and impeccable execution,"While I haven't read the best selling book 'Divergent' by Veronica Roth, I was quite amused and baffled by the comments from individuals mentioning how the movie doesn't capture all that's there in the book and of various other dis-similarities between the book and the movie. After all, the movie is based on the book and not a replica of the book.Divergent, the movie, is directed by Neil Burger who is known for his films The Illusionist and Limitless is about choosing a faction as defined by the futuristic society and survival in the respective faction. The movie has Shailene Woodley who plays Tris, Theo James playing Four, Ashley Judd playing Tris' mother and Kate Winslet plays Jeanine who is the head of one of the factions called Erudite.Apparently, there was a war and Chicago was the only place that was saved which led to formulation of a society that is divided into five factions - Abnegation the selfless, Dauntless the brave, Erudite the intelligent, Candor the honest, and Amity the peaceful. As per the rule prevailing in the society, when all teenagers reach the age of 16, they have to undergone a simulation that would help them understand which faction do they belong to. However, each individual is free to chose his/her faction and the same choice can't be changed later whatsoever. Tris' parents are under Abnegation wherein her dad is a close aide to the President of the society. On the day of the test, Tris learns that she doesn't belong to any faction and hence is ""Divergent"" however she must guard this secret with her life or else she will pay for it with her life. Tris, much to her parent's surprise, choses to be a Dauntless and then initiates a daunting journey for Tris.Dauntless are hard, demanding, emotionless (well mostly) and tough to the core. Tris has to become dauntless, both physically and emotionally. She meets Four there who is the instructor at Dauntless and with this team he makes sure that the new recruits 'earn' their place in the faction or else they shall be faction-less. What follows is a fast paced and an exhilarating journey for Tris and her friends to be above the line and eventually become officially Dauntless. The journey is incredibly tough with hardcore training, merciless fighting sequences and some dare-devil acts.Neil Burger couldn't have picked up a better cast as each character is perfect for his/her role and makes you believe their part. Shailene Woodley understands her transition from Beatrice to Tris and plays it without a flinch. Theo James is what he is supposed to be; arrogant, rude, serious, tough and kind, probably all of these at once. Kate Winslet has a smaller screen time but she delivers it with panache and with such poise and ease that you want to see more of her. She as Jeanine is absolutely cunning, shrewd and witting to put Abnegation down and have Erudite be the rulers. Casting Winslet as a sweet villain is one of the best decisions by Burger. The movie is full of pumped up dialogues and jaw dropping sets. Cinematography is brilliant with capturing incredible frames with excellence.I keep hearing statements like 'Divergent' is a different version of 'Hunger Games'. Well let me break it up for you - it's NOT just like not every ship sinking movie is not Titanic.I am excited to learn that a sequel will be in place by 2015 but I am sad to learn at the same time that Neil Burger won't be directing it because he insists on been given amply and adequate time frame to bring 'Insurgent', the sequel, to life and the makers are not willing to provide the same. I echo Woodley's thoughts when she says, ""It was weird, he was the leader of this entire pack, and he created this world, he dreamt it up, he made all of the executive decisions. It was strange to think that somebody else is going to come over and take it on.""My recommendation - go watch Divergent for brilliant performances and excellent execution.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Entertaining... cant wait for next installment,"Although this is a Teen movie supposedly, as a 48 year old male, i must be a teen?

The support cast are all very well chosen and performances are superb in my opinion. I thought the scenery and staging was excellent. I did see it on DVD which had deleted scenes, and these showed up some of the missing pieces of information that would have given the ending away, so I'm sort of glad they were removed.

What did they spend $85 million on? There's no special effects whatsoever unless you consider a computer generated landscape of a futuristic Chicago a special effect. The acting is weak. The two main characters are completely miscast for a romance, it's borderline pedophilic. The filmwork feels like it was shot on a vid-cam. I would have walked out about three quarters of the way thru but didn't want to disturb the others in the theater so I just sat there yawning and rolling my eyes. What a stupid movie.

It is upon us...,"""I don't want to be one thing, I want to be good, honest, & kind."" It is here. Like kids waiting for cookies in the oven. The moment of truth has come. From the beloved book by Veronica Roth, Hollywood has their grasp on this baby, diaper inside out. So how was it?I always wanted to see a 60s, 70s stylized sci-fi, Pink Floyd inspired. Unfortunately, the style nowadays settles with fake, eye-rolling & desensitizing teen material, separating young people's appreciation with good cinema for this. So where does Divergent fit in? Come on, where doesn't it? This is the epitome of modern-day, 3-week cinematic hit, & forgotten two star snore on a Sunday afternoon 2 years from release on Shaw. Yeah, the acting, the story, & the vision here is flat all around. These actors will get their fame & clinch a lifetime spotlight in Young People's magazine, & TMZ laughs. So it's another wretched teen blockbuster. The look of this dread, it's disgusting & destroys my palette.I believe a Juno-quirky teenage styled flick, fused with an intense sci-fi is an interesting conception. However, the game plan & execution results show. Now Imagine a Rainbow, Pull-n-peel licorice, if each peel was a different color & was pre-pealed, & each peal defined a film genre, you'd have the layout for Divergent.It's not free nor comfortable. To satisfy hormone-confused teens, they heavily coat it with held-back character interactions & motivations, never reaching or exploring above or below the norm. Maintaining teen-equilibrium content of an awkward nature, which in itself is awkward, with one somehow managing to free themselves & enjoy that in an unbelievably grand fantasy universe as it's backdrop. Tis unmixed, left to dry. Too afraid of doing or even trying. It remains a scattered vision not knowing what it is, forgetting what it is, & leaving asking the critic's swear word: why?There's a big twist. I read the book, & it is a rhythmically flowing experience filled with page-turning thrills and emotion. The film, which many passion-lacking productions exploit easily, breaks down the story to so many different visions, it's as if several directors manhandled the project. The story was compromised in the process. Nothing was clear nor soothing or enduring. Every 5 minutes I felt I needed to re-engage myself because the music went off the page too often to care.It is on the verge of a Broken Picture. Maybe that's the vision, a new revolution in cinema we are yet to settle with. Maybe this picture is ingenious in every way.

This movie talks about the defensive mentality and its consequences,"Let's talk a bit about the dangers of defensive mentality. This kind of mentality proved time and again to be very detrimental. But let's see why what is it that makes this type of mentality so dangerous.The first reflex of the defensive mentality is to build a wall as tall and as strong as possible, be it a concrete and barbed-wire wall as it goes with human communities, be it an imaginary wall, just as strong in people's minds and hearts. Anything coming from outside is now automatically rejected. The logical consequence is inertia in all aspects: economic, political and cultural when it comes to societies, spiritual and emotional with individuals.Once this wall is built, the second stage involves the removal of any element, this time from inside (as the outside world is already blocked) which does not conform to the already established standards. A feeling of fear is maintained in the society by the means of external and internal imaginary enemies, so that people can accept repressive measures more easily. This fear also helps to bring people to support the regime in power. The same thing happens with the individuals: the mind maintains all sorts of anxieties and imaginary diseases, which keep them in a continuous state of fear, not allowing them to leave the confinement defended by the wall. Thus, they remain in their imaginary stronghold, believing themselves to be safe.As this regime matures, a very dangerous process takes place, namely the transfer of one's responsibilities towards the others. The citizens are no longer responsible about the community, as the system is talking care of everything and everyone. The system educates, takes care of the people's health, builds and distributes housing and so on. Consequently, people only need to focus on delivering on their duties at their work place. Moreover, they do not even need to worry about how the results of their work is used. The scientists are just scientists and the system is making sure that the results of their work are properly used. Soldiers and policemen no longer need to worry about the morality and rightness of their orders, they only need to carry them out, regardless of what their conscience might tell them.The final blow delivered by this process is applied to the most fundamental values of the people. The isolation erodes the connection between people and makes them unable to feel. The human bond is lost. Now the system raises the stake and attacks savagely the most important human values and call into question even the human nature, proclaiming the need for a new man, most of the time a man that relinquished the feelings and the weaknesses brought upon by them. The blood ties and family bonds are nothing more than abstract notions stemming from the humanity's primitive past. Family is now only a social unit that prepares responsible citizens to be delivered to the society. As a replacement, total loyalty to the collective is demanded as well as the willingness of sacrifice for this greater body, which now represents family.The consequences of this process can only be disastrous for both individual and society. The diversity and pluralism are eliminated, everyone must behave and think the same, any progress or personal opinion threatens the stability of the system and are nipped in the bud. Fascism and communism proposed and implemented such systems, and the majority of the population embraced them willingly or tacitly, out of their desire for ""peace"" or ""tranquility"" and out of their fear of others coming to take what was theirs. What were we talking about in the beginning? About the defensive mentality, about building walls around communities as well as hearts and minds.And what could be the solution to this problem? Is hard to believe that the solution could come from the top, as once installed in a position of power, elites are unlikely to relinquish that position willingly. Then, just as the problem, the solution could only come from the grass roots, from the rank-and-file people, more exactly with people realizing the trap they have fallen into. These people manage to find their true self through a painful and dangerous introspection. Afterwards, they break down the imaginary walls built around their hearts and minds and also smash the walls around their societies.The discussion about the defensive mentality and its consequences, have covered the main philosophical, political and motivational themes of this movie. It is an example of a movie that sinks its teeth in a theme and never lets go until it is done with it. This way it has a chance to actually transmit something to the viewers. The rest is action and suspense, sensuality and special effects meant to sell this ""masterpiece"", which by the way is well made.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This film has resonated with me,"Divergent (2014) is a sci-fi action movie directed by Neil Burger which is based on a book called Divergent by Veronica Roth. The movie takes place in a future Chicago where people are split into factions based on their virtues. Beatrice (Tris) Prior, played by Shailene Woodley, finds out she is Divergent, which means she doesn't belong to just one faction. She is seen as a danger to the existing system, and she has to stay alive.Divergent (2014) captivates with its stunning drone shots, showcasing a futuristic Chicago that, while heavily CGI-enhanced, felt unnecessary but still well-executed for its setting. Trise's narration, voiced with compelling depth, adds a rich layer to the storytelling. From the very start, the movie hooks you with its humanistic portrayal of society, weaving a narrative that feels both big and personal.The soundtrack by Junkie XL is really good and has a soulful quality that matches the film's hopeful tone. It also uses the inspired music of this movie that has the futuristic vibe, just like Ellie Goulding's song, which I wasn't sure about at first but ended up fitting very well. Cinematographically, ""Divergent"" impresses with its clean, high-quality shots and thoughtful camera movements.The narrative explores themes of trust and identity, drawing parallels with ""The Hunger Games"" yet establishing its own distinct dystopian vibe. The characters, especially Beatrice, are well-crafted; her cold-blooded, fearful character and ability to maintain composure under pressure are particularly striking. The Action scenes in the film are executed with remarkable professionalism, adding to the overall thrilling experience.Overall, Divergent (2014) is a film that resonated with me deeply, reminding me in many ways of ""The Hunger Games,"" yet standing out with its unique approach to a teen dystopian narrative. Its blend of impactful storytelling, visually stunning cinematography, and a soulful soundtrack and inspired music that makes it a memorable cinematic experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I really enjoyed it.,"The acting was great and I really thought it was a very good movie. I don't usually like Sci-Fi, and this movie may make a convert of me. Nice job. All of the characters were believable, and the set and the special effects were also good. I have not read the book, so I cannot compare the two. However, it is always difficult to get all of the details of a book into a movie, so maybe that is why some people were disappointed. I know the movie was set in the future, but you can certainly see how some of the factions are similar to today's world of the have's and the have-nots, as the middle class dwindles away.

And then ruin the movie by forcing in my lovey dubby fake relationship into the scenes through out the movie.Oh yeah, and i forgot to mention how the movie completely sucked after that ""Sex"" scene... as, Hollywood kicked in a ruined the movie.but yeah, Hollywood knows the tards of today, targeting those of lesser intelligence... whom wouldn't know a good plot if it killed them. So, you probably shouldn't trust my review.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Shailene Woodley Cannot Act,"Obviously this movie received mixed reviews, because on this site it has a 7.6 and on rotten tomatoes a 40%. I liked reading Divergent, it is not as similar to the Hunger Games as you think it is, it's actually unique in it's own way. What ticked me off about this movie is that it was pretty different from the book, (enough to make me annoyed) and that the entire relatively new cast (besides Winslet) cannot act. Theo James is sexy and he knows it in the movie, and Shailene Woodley is just ugh I can't explain it but she cannot act! Why are they comparing her to the fabulously talented Jennifer Lawrence when she can't even hold a candle in the acting world? This movie messed up the story for me, did Veronica Roth even see the script?",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Best Movie,Have read the books and loved them but must say First i didn't liked the Trailer at all but than when i was going to watch the Movie i was like speechless because i loved that movie a lot from the amazing casting to the Scenes! Have watched the movie 4 times in the Cinema and i couldn't get enough and it is nothing like other Movies it has it own Special way and i don't get when People compare it with other Movies like they should stop doing that. Shailene Woodley has played the Role as Tris (Beatrice) so good and even Theo James just the whole cast did a great Job you can't say that there was any mistake because for me this Movie was the best ever in the last years i could never enjoy any movie that much but Divergent has changed it. I can only recommend the Movie to every single Person on this Planet. Looking Forward to Insurgent,10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Meh,"Honestly was very disappointed by this movie.If I hadn't read the book first I'd be totally lost as to what's really going on. They do not explain anything and to top that off it's not necessarily the same as In the book either, so much left out is really needed to tel the story. There was nothing keeping my attention on the screen.. Boring, predictable, badly written, badly acted and just plain blah. I went into watching hunger games thinking the worst and couldn't take my eyes off, but this movie I thought would have the same excitement and falls far short. If they come out with the rest of the trilogy it might be a miracle I can't see spending all that money for nothing..",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Superb entertainment,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Divergent"" (2014) is a superb entertainment. I haven't read the book, but i was hooked from the beginning till the very last end. Shailene Woodley gives a great performance for this kind of movie, you simply can not resist for rotting for her. Other actors did a descent job for the material. ""Divergent"" which is based on a book is type of the movies that i call ""21 th century movie adaptations Beverly Hils style"" - it's all actually a bit familiar for this type of movies, aka. ""The Host"" (2013), ""The Hunger Games"" franchise - you get the structure, and there is always a hero (a heroine)which isn't like all other, and she starts a rebellion - no spoilers here. But ""Divergent"" is better then ""The Host"", and it's better than the first ""The Hunger Games"" film.Overall, if like these adaptations, you will definitely will love ""Divergent"", which is wonderfully paste, good acted, solidly written and to sum it up, it's a great entertainment.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Unless you are a teen, it will disappoint...but I've seen worse","Overall, this movie clearly had a targeted audience, teen girls. The movie itself is not a bad movie, but i am not in its target audience so i didn't enjoy it that much. The music was teenie, acting was average at best, plot was mostly predictable and very easy to follow. The story line is stupid...splitting everyone its factions, ya cause we all know that wont cause problems and power struggles. I never read the book, but the movie had major holes and it was almost hard to watch. There was minimal action and comedy and it was mostly about teenage problems:fitting in, hot ""bad guy"" guy and such and such...Unless you are a teenage trapped in a adult body, this movie is below average, but it could be worse.I've seen worse, but I've seen a whole lot better",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Loved it!,"I really enjoyed this movie! Story is original and interesting, this is not entirely what i expected when i went to see the movie. Less romance but more about the fight to survive being different which is basically something we all do eventually in some way, however, the main problem in that 'perfect' society is control over people, they put their faction before family. About the book-movie adaption i don't know much, i haven't read the books, but a good movie for me is when after seeing it you want to read the book and that is what Divergent did for me. Story was summarized nicely so that you actually got enough details about relationship between Tris and her family, Four and new found friends and enemies in the new faction. This movie was worth watching and i'm looking forward to the sequel :)",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Inception meets Brave New World, but dumbed down for kids","Inception meets Brave New World, but dumbed down for kids. You could also throw in a few other dystopian/post-apocalyptic movies and books that this is derivative of (not that Inception is such a movie, but the dreams-within-dreams scenes in Divergent reminded me of that).So, derive a plot from these books/movies, then dumb it down for kids. Hero(ine) is a teen. The good guys are the running, jumping, climbing, fighting types, not the intellectuals, or anyone else. (The perpetual running, jumping and climbing actually made the Dauntless people quite comical, rather than heroic, to me. Their whole shtick just seemed so lame).Throw in the usual underdog prevails against the odds and ultimately becomes a hero routine, with a bit of romance and an evil conspiracy by the adults/non-action types and you have your common-or-garden teen action movie.Only positive thing I can say about this is that at least it was better than The Hunger Games (but only marginally so). At least Divergent had some semblance of grit and edginess - Hunger Games is a like a Disney action-movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
