Criminally underrated,"After a troubled production that saw the budget balloon to nearly $160 million and writer Michael Crichton step in and take over directing duties from John McTiernan ('Predator', 'Die Hard') on a series of re-shoots, 'The 13th Warrior' (Based on Crichton's novel ""Eaters Of The Dead"", well worth reading on its own), opened to scathing reviews and weak box office. According to Wikipedia, it's the biggest box office bomb in history. Quite a pedigree, eh? But here's the thing. It's a really good movie.Featuring a classic stranger in a strange land formula and moving without any wasted motion--without sacrificing story or character, 'The 13th Warrior' is a rousing, old fashioned adventure tale. Antonio Banderas leads a cast of mostly unknowns, but everyone really makes the most out of their characters; particularly the 13 warriors themselves. Accompanied by a stirring score from the great Jerry Goldsmith, The 13th Warrior sits atop my list of the most underrated films of certainly the last few decades, if not all-time. Forget the naysayers, if you like the action/adventure genre, I think You'll like this one.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Good enough for what it is, fascinating for what it could have been.","This is an extremely well crafted film, but a poorly edited one. Much like The Ghost and the Darkness it has such a winning historical concept that it is easy to forgive a little narrative incoherency from time to time. This film is a bit muddled when it comes to plot and characterization but hits all the right notes in terms of creating an adventurous spirit and thrilling action sequences. Jerry Goldsmith's score is a real high point, as is the cinematography. This is an absolutely wonderful film to get all caught up in on a lonely night because it makes you feel as if you are on the journey with Banderas' character. It is an action thriller that is actually...thrilling. In particular the scene with the ""fire dragon"" is one of the more memorable battle sequences I have seen in any movie, and I really mean that. The only negative aspects of the film are the feeling that a lot of scenes were left on the editing room floor, which is true, and if there was ever a film that really deserved a director's cut this is certainly one of them so long as Jerry Goldsmith's music (the soul of the picture) remains in. (Greame Revell composed a score for the unreleased longer version, which I have heard and in no way compares to Goldsmith's thunderous adventure music). The lavish costumes, set designs, memorable characters, and brilliant camera work somehow allow this film to overcome its editorial handicaps. All being said, this is a film well worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Why is this movie so underrated?,"""Merciful Father, I have squandered my days with plans of many things... this was not among them. But at this moment, I beg only to live the next few minutes well."" -Ahmed Ibn FadhlanCriminally underappreciated adventure! It mixes real Arab traveller Ahmad Ibn Fadlan, mythical story of Beowulf and Neolithic cavemen. The more you know about these three, the more enjoyment you will get from this movie. I can easily understand how people unfamiliar with these subjects were just lost and confused, feeling not helped by choppy editing where even important side characters just disappear without a trace!I love it! Banderas is great balancing charm and humor in equal measure. Vladimir Kulich is spot on as the Viking leader Buliwyf. It's also strange and great to see sword and sorcery movie where main protagonist prays for Allah before final battle.Where is bluray with extras? Where is directors cut? Take my money already!!!",8.0,Anonymous,History
I loved this movie!,"Action! Adventure! Incredible scenery and cinematography!  But best of all a wonderfully powerful cast!  As the deep and thoughtful chieftain Buliwyf, Vladimir Kulich was splendid.  He played his part with dignity, power and intelligence.  Another stand-out performance was that of Dennis Storhoi who played Herger the Joyous.  Perfect timing and temperament.  Really fun to watch.  Antonio Banderas as the narrator of the piece and, incidentally, the 13th warrior was also fun to watch.  He has a knack for humor and uses it well.  The whole ensemble cast was a joy to watch as they moved through-out the film as a team of men who valued each others strengths and talents.The camera work in this film is dangerous and thrilling.  Our perspective is intimate and that lends a great deal of excitement to the movie experience. Thank you Mr. Menzes!The 13th Warrior is for anyone who believes in honor, valor and courage. Also, for anyone who likes Vikings, horses, battles, blood and gore or men. Women who like men will like this movie!",,Anonymous,History
"Scandinavian myths and mysteries, brought in a very decent way.","I guess every region has its own legends and saga's, but I've always found the Scandinavian legends about trolls, monsters and ghosts even more intriguing and interesting as ours. It's no wonder that these people have created these legends once. If you've been there and if you've seen the impressive nature with its immense forests and lakes, the fact that the sun never rises in winter and stays 24 hours a day in summer... makes it easy to understand why this is the land of such creatures.The movie tells the story of an Arab courtier / diplomat who was sent to the barbaric North as a punishment for falling in love with the wrong woman. In AD 922, this could be seen as an execution, because there was no way he would return (it's the same reason why the Catholic Church sent people who had committed awful sins, as pilgrims from our region to Santiago De Compostella in Spain). When they are about to get robbed and killed somewhere in the fields, they manage to escape and accidentally stumble upon a group of Vikings, which saves their lives, because the Barbarians are terrified of these vicious warriors from the North. They soon get befriended and are able to stay with the Vikings, when a young boy, a messenger from the North, comes to the Vikings to ask for help. In their home country many people die because of ""an evil whose name should not be pronounced"". They consult an oracle who tells them that they should send 13 warriors, but that one of them shouldn't be a Viking. The Arab, however not believing that these mythical creatures from the forests really exist, joins them in their battle against the Wendol...Normally I'm not too much of a fan of Antonio Banderas' work, but this time I really liked him as the Arab with the impressive name of Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan Ibn Al Abbas Ibn Rashid Ibn Hamad (I guess you better don't try to say that 10 times in a row). The other actors all did a very good job as well, even though I have to admit that I've never heard of most of them before.The story is nice and well written, the way it was all shot is done properly and overall I must say that I really enjoyed watching this movie. I'm sure that many will not agree, but personally I liked it more than the ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies. I like legends and mystery in movies and this movie gave me both. I give it a 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Terror and action with an excellent Antonio Banderas battling killer marauders,"In the Dark Ages , AD 922 Ahmad Ibn (Antonio Banderas) an Arab nobleman is banished by a wrong love to the Barbaric north . On his way he encounters Turks in Central Asia and Russian and Varangians (Volga Vikings) . As a diplomatic person he meets an experienced Arab (Omar Sharif) and befriends a group of Vikings Norsemen (Vladimir Kulich,Dennis Storhoi..) returning their homeland . Shortly after , he is enlisted to battle a mysterious evil force, creatures of the mist (though never explains who the ravenous-hunger ""mist monsters"" actually are and in the novel, they were the descendants of the Neanderthals) attacking by night as supernatural head-cutters (Wendol) and devouring human flesh that threaten the village existence .This epic movie initially titled ¨Eaters of the dead¨and subsequently ¨The 13th Warrior¨ begins with a real sense of wonder and surprise and winding up with continuous struggles against the body eaters . The picture packs great loads of action , special effects abundant , horror , breathtaking combats and a little bit of gore and blood . Based on the historic character : Ahmed Ibn Fadlan who traveled as an emissary to the land of the Volga Bulgars to convert them to Islam , he returned in 923, and no record after this date refers to him. Stunning battles scenes illuminate the full-blown adventure with a plethora of engaging action set pieces on the combats in which the heads and limbs are slice off here and there and everywhere while other parts of body are slit open . The movie was slated to be released as ""Eaters of the Dead"" in 1998, after the film was considered unwatchable during test screenings , then Michael Crichton took over the project , and he made some important changes .The film gets an impressive control of the crowd scenarios with a climatic and overwhelming finale battle . Exceptional and colorful cinematography shot in Canadian outdoors by Peter Menzies . Musical score by the veteran composer Jerry Goldsmith is extraordinary and spectacular . However , Graeme Revell had composed a complete original score , but Revell's original soundtrack was scorned , and brought in Jerry Goldsmith to rescore the movie . The film is based on Michael Chricton's (also producer) novel :¨Eaters of the dead¨ inspired by medieval poem ¨Beowulf ¨ and the authentic travel realized by a scout Arab towards Northland . The film was shelved during years for disagreement among director (McTiernan) and producer (Chricton) . The motion picture was beautifully executed with phenomenal production design (Wolf Kroeger) and well directed by John McTiernan . The flick will appeal to adventures cinema buffs and Antonio Banderas fans . Rating : 7.5/10 . Above average . Well worth seeing for numerous action battle scenes which have you on the edge of your seat.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Totally unexpected, this was a great movie!","Don't believe the negative reviews on this one. Its easily the most underrated movie I have come across, and can best be described as a hidden gem for the ones who like historical adventure/action-movies (Braveheart/Gladiator/Kingdom of Heaven/Robin Hood) and fantasy-movies.Others have described it better here on IMDb, so I am just going to say this: It is not a historical correct piece, and do not try to be. It should be viewed as a fantasy, even though the vikings portrayed and their buildings/settlement is the most realistic I have seen in any movie to date.Btw: To all you who like the above-mentioned movies for the big battle-scenes and sword-fighting, don't expect this one to have its major impact in that area (even though it got them). On the other hand this movie portrays a much more realistic take on fighting in pre-medieval times. Instead of having the one super-hero defying all logic, you get a band of fighting comrades which together becomes a fierce force. There is a fantastic cast in this movie, with Banderas, Storhøi and Kulich making their characters come truly alive.This is a great adventure of a movie, which should be regarded alongside the other movies I mentioned above.9/10 - Must see for all who like adventure/fantasy",9.0,Anonymous,History
Nice gem of a movie,"An arab and a Viking walks into a bar... Jokes aside, this movie was amazing even up to the end. It did what most movies lack now a days and in the past too. A ""perfect"" ending to its story. Banderas was good as always and the unique story was amazing. The only flaws I could find about this movie was that the fight scenes were a bit lackluster (but what did you expect from a movie from 1999) and a bit of shaky cam which is never good in a movie except for when it's needed (in a horror movie for example.). All in all though, a good and enjoyable movie. But when is Antonio Banderas not entertaining?",7.0,Anonymous,History
Keeps getting better with each viewing,"This film makes one wonder what would have happened if, after the superb understated little gem that was ""Nomads"" Mctiernan had made something other than ""Die Hard"". Apparently assorted screenplays for an adaptation of Michael Crichton's pseudo-historical novel ""Eaters of the Dead"" had been knocking around Hollywood for years before Crichton's name become forever associated with ""Jurassic Park"". At that point the smell of money began to emanate from the project and so, away we went. This could very easily have been awful. That it is actually an emotionally and structurally complete and satisfying film is, in no small part, due to its respectful and level-headed treatment of two disparate and under-explored cultures, both foreign to western audiences namely Umayad Arab and Viking. Anonio Banderas is as good as he has ever been as Ibn Fahdlan, an unwilling ambassador to the Norsemen who finds himself part of a band of unusually believable heroes defending a crumbling Scandanavian kingdom against a possibly supernatural menace. The casting of (to Americans at least) unknown European actors as the viking warriors is key to making them seem to be so real and thus to committing the audience to their fate. Czech actor Vladimir Kulich as leader Buliwyf is a dominating presence and equal credit goes to the Norwegian Dennis Storhoi as the charmingly phlegmatic Herger the Joyous. Accepting that, at some level, this is ""The Seven Samuraii"" with longboats this is an original and entertaining experience. McTiernan, making intelligent use of night and a rain machine, films some of the better battle sequences in recent memory. He also presides over the most thoughtful (if not totally plausible) handling of different languages that I can recall seeing. It's sort of the next logical step from his transitioning from Russian to English on board the Red October. An interesting tale in a gorgeous and well thought-out historical context. Entertaining without being mindless. In other words, a rarity.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A rare but good Viking movie.,"I was thinking while watching this movie, why are there hardly any viking movies made? There is a good recipe for an action movie with Vikings what with the fighting,raping and pilliging and the 13th Warrior is a good action movie, although the Vikings are the good guys in this. Antonio Banderes plays an arab who is picked to fight as a warrior against an unknown race of people who attacked a village of Vikings. This has the feel of the Seventh Samarai of the Magnifiscent Seven ,the few oppressed against the many. While this film has nothing it it to make it a brilliant film it is very watchable and i would advise you to watch this if you are into war/action/adventure movies. 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Lacking movie...,"This movie is seriously lacking. With a story like this you would expect something way better than this pretty messy movie.Especially from a director like John McTiernan you would expect something way better. The movie however is seriously lacking tension while the story itself on its own is pretty tense and mysterious. With ""Predator"" McTiernan showed that he could mix hard-action with science-fiction. Then why can't he mix adventure with action?The characters are heavily underdeveloped and I seriously can't tell who is who in this. Antonio Banderas however is good and believable as the anti-hero this time.The sword fights are also somewhat disappointing. The movie is just way too dark and you can't really tell what is happening the whole time. Also the fights are pretty short themselves. There however are some good gory scene's. A normal functional male while still find some pleasure in watching this movie.Also the pace feels just completely wrong at times and the story never really becomes completely clear. The story itself reminded me also a bit too much of other stories and movies like ""The Magnificent Seven"". Yes, they could have really called this movie ""The Magnificent Thirtheen"".McTiernan really messed this movie up.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",5.0,Anonymous,History
Fantastic Epic,"The 13th Warrior was murdered by critics when it 1st came out. As one of the best Epic adventures ever, The 13th warrior is very entertaining and sweeping on every level. The final battle was nothing short of exhilarating, and it was a joy to see Omar Sharif on the big screen again. This movie is very underrated and it went unnoticed...I think the marketing for this movie sucked. My biggest disappointment is that Jerry Goldsmith's score in this movie never received any award and surely his work in this one is one of the best ever to be put on film..on par with Randy Edelman's work in the last of the mohicans. The movie is never boring. Running only for 90 minutes there is no one dull moment or space for you to sit back and relax..everything happens fast and straight to the point. The direction and the cinematography are all top notch, while the cast is great specially the actor who played Beowulf..his commanding presence on the screen totally ruled the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"A flawed, but underrated film in my opinion","I never read the book yet, but I'm planning to someday if I have the chance. However, I wasn't too sure whether or not I should like this movie adaptation of Michael Crichton's novel, so I decided to watch the whole thing online feeling a little underwhelmed at first, but as the film progresses, I said to myself, ""You know what? This might turn out pretty decent."" and it did. Apparently, this movie has some problems that ruined it, but I don't think this movie is as bad as the critics said it was.Let me start off with the redeeming aspects. The scenery is magnificent, the costumes and make-ups are brilliant, and cinematography is solid it gives a great atmosphere to the entire film. The direction is above-decent, the pacing never fails to be too fast nor too slow and the music from Jerry Goldsmith is great with some dark moments that suited the gripping action sequences really well, but the strongest aspect goes to it's fine acting. Antonio Banderas is great as the lead role, Vladimir Kulich is also good, and Diane Venora is beyond excellent. Like I said before, there are some flaws and those are it's predictable story, messy script, and mediocre dialog.Overall, The 13th Warrior isn't a kind of masterpiece that I would recommend to fans of the book, but in my opinion, I would say that this is quite underrated and a decent one too.

"Nice To Look At, But Story Is Only 'Fair'","I found this wasn't a bad action film and certainly better than the national critics would have you believe.The best feature of the movie is the cinematography and the 5.1 sound. Story- wise, it's so-so, about a bunch of Norsemen along with Arab (played by Antonio Bandaras) fighting some Mongol invaders.The film could have used some humor, some better character development, and perhaps even a love interest . It also could have been better had it been 10-15 minutes shorter, but that's a common complaint of movies.

"I watched it 20 times, it never gets old. Go for it!","Oh, well, this movie seems to have fallen into obscurity now.
I will start this short review with the latest references to this:Vladimir Kulich, the 2nd leading actor besides Banderas, voiced Ulfrick Stormcloack, the leader of the Stormcloack faction in The Elder Scrolls V: SkyrimI could tell this from the first damn second, because the actors and the music from this movie was so amazing, I still remember the soundtrack and all of the punchline.Vladimir Kulick was also featured in the TV series, the Vikins for a few brief episodes, for a minor role.What is very interesting is the fact that Kulick was first introduced to the show the same way Bandera's character was introduced to the Vikings: by bathing and spewing in the same pot (an obvious reference to the 13th Warrior.What will impress you most?

100 % Testosteron,"This film is as MANLY as film like this can get. It's on the same level as CONAN THE BABARIAN. One giant piece of epicness.Jerry Goldsmith does one hell of a good job as a composer. He and Basil Poledouris knew how to compose the music for a film like that. Forget the Skyrim soundtrack (as good as it is), this is the music for a barbarian epic.John Mc Tiernan delivers a solid work as the director. His visions for how to put the word epic on the big screen really pay off. It's not on the same high level as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but it doesn't have to be. He did the best he could and you can feel that.I never was a huge fan of Antonio Banderas but, by god, he fits the role. Even if he is Spanish, he looks like an arab. As I said, I never was a big fan of his acting, but here he gave his very best. Maybe not in every single shot he is in, but I don't blame him for that. He did a very good job in my opinion.In all this film deserves a lot of respect. It's one hell of a good film, even with its flaws and problems here and there.Check it out.

WOO-HOO!! Viking-Violence!!!,"I'm really wondering why there aren't making more movies like this! What is in more interesting than the history of the Scandinavian countries? What is more fascinating than the tales of Northern myths and their legendary Gods?? Well, in my personal opinion, nothing is and that's why I was so enthusiast when I first heard about this Thirteenth Warrior being released! And even though I'll admit the film is flawed on several levels, I enjoyed it very much and I'd like to encourage as much people as possible to find out more about the North men and their intriguing history. Co-producer Michael Crichton who also wrote the screenplay bases the 13th Warrior on his own `Eaters of the Dead' novel. It's a tale of a banished Arab man who joins twelve North men on a conquest against an ancient form of evil. He learns their language and becomes a warrior during the journey, he fights along against the `Wendol'These are giant bear-like men who're extremely violent and savage. The good thing about The 13th Warriors is that it contains multiple impressive battle sequences and extremely interesting characters. For example the leader of the North men -  Buliwyf -  who's a truly overwhelming personality. The costumes and geographical settings are breath taking and perhaps even the most succeeded aspects in the entire production. And, of course, you can't tell a Viking tale without the use of explicit violencethe battles are pretty gruesome and the shed of blood is enormous. I didn't have a problem with that, though. I even love it but it might be something to keep under consideration when you have a weak stomach and you're planning to watch this film. Yet, it's only fair that I name a few of them negative elements The 13th Warrior suffers from. The largest parts of the script  and especially the dialogues  are very poorly written. The film also desperately tries to insert humor that is painfully unfunny and even embarrassing at times. Even the entire last battle scene may have been skipped since it's too heroic and a bit too much. Terrifically shot, though. Antonio Banderas will never be a class-A actor, neitherluckily for him, the accent works out well enough in stories like this. Nonetheless, The 13th Warrior is good entertainment and the background of it is food for education! Vikings rule!!",7.0,Anonymous,History
Very well made entertaining movie,"I found myself glued to the television despite my inability to understand most of the early dialog in The 13th Warrior. Curiosity kept me from turning away and the action hooked me. Antonio Banderas' performance is intelligent and understated. He may headline, but the unknown actors take the lead with very strong performances. Omar Sharif is certainly recognizable, but of limited exposure here. It's sad that he belittled such a great movie because of it's box office failure. This movie has a LOTR feel about it without the high end production. The production here is just right for the story and cast. The main attraction over LOTR is that it only runs 103 minutes. Beware, if you are easily affected by carnage. But, if you enjoy a classic tale of good vs. evil and competitive action, you will embrace this adventure.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Epic story told in a precise, short yet attention grabbing manner!","Recently I bought the DVD of the 13th warrior. After watching it, I regret not having seen back in 1999 when it was on the big screen.The sound effect in the movie was awesome, the acting was brilliant as well. The story is short and solid, even though the story is straight forward, yet it contains twist and turns that kept me in my seat throughout the entire movie. I am sure that the movie plot somehow contains elements from the story of Beowulf, I mean, the leader of the warrior is Buliwyf (similar to Beowulf), and a brave, brave warrior at his best. The ending was dramatic and heroic. I watched it twice already, it is likely that I will watch it again and again in the future.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"You'll ask ""why?"" a lot","We had high hopes for this movie. They were in vain. This is a classic example of a movie that had almost no thought put into its plot. It is a series of fights, interrupted from time to time with scenes of dialogue that raise more questions than they answer.The 13th Warrior begins with a scene of Ambassador Ahmet (who existed in real life) headed north after being sent away so he won't fool around with the king's wife. He and his small retinue bump into a passing Viking gang, and for reasons never explained Ahmet must join a band of 13 Vikings in a mission to help a semi-feudal village that is under attack. Even more odd is Ahmet's decision to join the Vikings. He already has a mission, and doesn't seem to be under any duress. Even a throw-away line along the lines of, ""I decided to go, so I could learn more about these North People who I will need to understand as ambassador"" would have helped.Along the way Ahmet learns how to speak the Viking language by, apparently, watching the Vikings talk. Never are we shown a Viking saying a word and tying it to an item, so that an observer might be able to attach meaning to the words. Yet somehow our hero learns the language. What are the odds of that?At this point The 13th Warrior becomes a sort of a Viking ""Seven Samauri,"" with our Viking heroes gathering the village people (the serfs, not the disco group, though if *those* Village People appeared it would not have surprised me) to defend the town against a band of cannibals who are (again) never fully explained.During the ensuring battle scenes, there is an attempt to show a juxtaposition between the culture of Ahmet the Muslum and Rennaisance Man and that of the crude but effective Vikings. For example, Ahmet has trouble wielding a Viking broadsword but once he has a curved scimitar made to order he is ready to rock (of course, later, when the band sorties on a mission to attack the cannibals, Ahmet has a Viking broadsword tied to his back and the scimitar is nowhere in sight). Also, just before a big battle, Ahmet suddenly drops to his knees to pray as Muslins do five times a day (though we never see him do it at any other time). Anyway, you can *almost* feel the threads of a plot here revolving around Ahmet as an observer of another culture, but it never is clear nor develops (just like the rest of the movie).There are many instances where events make no sense. The cannibal tribe at one point early on seem to have kicked the Vikings' butts and are burning the village, then withdraw at the sound of a horn for no apparent reason. It just means they have to attack again later, after the village has time to recover a bit. There also seems to be some voodoo involved in that the Vikings (and Ahmet, for a little while) don't know if the cannibals are men or spirits. It's unclear why there is any doubt, since the cannibals look like guys with animal headdresses and fall when they are stabbed. And throughout the movie it appears that the odds are something like 20 or 30 to 1 against the Vikings (and the cannibals are on horses!), yet somehow we have a happy ending.The movie *tries* to draw on a theme of honor and courage. The Viking leader is noble and fights until he can no longer fight. But that theme is underminded by the numerous ploy holes. Why should we care about these people and what they fight for? Why are there only 13? Why do the cannibals attack? How did this start? Without answers to basic questions (and no clear indication of a moral cause), the idea of honor falls flat.I cannot believe the average rating for this movie is 6.2. We gave it a 2.",2.0,Anonymous,History
Beowulf meets Die Hard,"In the early years of the 10th century, an exiled Arabian nobleman falls in with a band of Vikings. Disgusted by their poor hygiene and their barbaric ways, he nevertheless reluctantly agrees to accompany them to a distant kingdom, where an unspeakable menace terrorizes the land.This is an interesting interpretation of the tale of Beowulf, with the monster Grendel transformed into the fierce Wendol, a tribe of cannibalistic Neanderthals who have somehow survived long past their time. Despite the fact that Banderas is the title character and credited as the star, he is not the hero here at all. The band of 13 is led by the huge and intimidating Buliwyf (read Beowulf), a hero among his people who must battle both the Wendol and their deadly ""mother."" Alexander Gudonov lookalike Vladimir Kulich is the hero of this film, and delivers a strong, amazing performance. Banderas spends much of the film bumbling, stumbling, screwing up and trying to keep up with the Vikings, who look upon him with contempt but finally, perhaps grudgingly, accept him.Okay, so it's not entirely historically accurate and suffers from production problems and an occasional overdose of testosterone, but it's not a bad movie by any means. The casting is great, with standout performances by the aforementioned Kulich as well as Dennis Storhoi as Herger, Banderas's translator and only friend; the handsome Scottish actor Tony Curran (in an unlikely kilt, but who cares?!?!) as the Celt Weath and the woefully underrated Richard Bremmer as the intimidating tattooed redheaded (and damn sexy!) Skeld. The film was worth watching for these three men alone, but then, I am female and perhaps a bit prejudiced in my opinions. These guys are HOT! But, I digress...Beautiful scenery, tense and bloody battles and a claustrophobic climax in a bone strewn cave lift this movie well above average. There's something for everyone here; fans of horror, fans of action, fans of classic literature should all find something to enjoy about this film. It may not be the best film ever made, but its still one of my very favorites.",10.0,Anonymous,History
This must be Michael Crichtons worst...,"A very unrealistic movie indeed.Maybe it is my Norwegian background, but I get irate when I experience the Vikings portrayed as savages like this. The Vikings had very high cultural values, in fact. They were not a mixture of new-Guinean cannibals and Wall Street brokers.Furthermore, the historic realism could have been done much, much better. Vikings learned early to make soap, from the Celts whom they both traded with and raided. Unfortunately soap-cooking disappeared with the replacing of Celtic Christianity in Norway by Catholicism.The special effects however makes the film look more accurate than it in reality is.

Based loosely upon historical fact,"The 13th Warrior may not match contemporary action film expectations and neither is it strictly a Beowulf allegory. While the film gives a nod to classic Epic literature, the real magic is grown of roots in history. In ""Eaters of the Dead"" the novel which inspired the film, writer Michael Crichton drew inspiration from the true story of Ibn Fadlan.Ahmed Ibn Fadlan was a poet and diplomat who lived in the caliphate of Bagdhad in the 10th century. He received a deputation in the year 921 A.D. to journey to the King of the Bulghars of the Volga as an emissary of the Caliph al-Muqtadir. Fadlan outlined the details of this journey in his 'risala' or 'kitlab' (diary/history). Somewhere along the way Fadlan found himself in the extensive company of an Eastern Scandinavian tribe called the Rusiyyah. The Rus were being raided by the Varangians, a more barbarous tribe with customs rooted in pre-history. In his story, Crichton calls the Varangians by the name of another barbaric European tribe, the Wendols. From their name we get the English words vandal and vandalize - so one can imagine in what sorts of business they engaged.So this is the background for the film. Is the movie history? No, but if one puts aside obvious errors such as Bulwyf's German plate armour (500 years ahead of its time) or another warrior's Roman helmet (500 years after its time) - the movie is enjoyable. The Rus were not Vikings with a capital V. They were Slavs who went a' viking, meaning raiding. Ibn Fadlan spent years among the Bulgars, Khazars and other Slavic tribes of the North. In all his travels, he gave no more detail than what he wrote of his time with the Rus and of their battles. What Crichton has given us is not history, but it is an entertaining point of departure from which to consider history. Next time you watch this movie, imagine you are Ibn Fadlan, come from a life of civilized luxury and suddenly thrown into this strange world. Try listening to the language, understanding his fear. Imagine that you must face cultures and battles entirely alien to your experience. That is what the 13th Warrior is all about. It is the tale of the journey, of the stranger in the strange land. It is a great adventure film, one I've enjoyed dozens of times.",,Anonymous,History

I'm not aware of another movie having used this trick before or after to be honest, but since I can't claim to have seen all the movies ever (no one can really), there might be one or more out there.What am I talking about? The fact that our main character learns to understand what others are saying even if it is not english they are speaking. And how do we and him get to understand and see this progress? By slowly turning the words others are saying into english. Genius move by the movie and its filmmakers.Apart from that we get quite the Viking action. Well made stunts and a story that is interesting and gripping enough for the viewer to follow. I rewatched this the other day and was still entertained by it",7.0,Anonymous,History
Amazed,"When i had a look on the cover, I though this couldn't be that great of a movie. And apparently by speaking with friends, they told me it wasn't that great, however none of them have ever watched it. I had a hard time recognize the language used in the beginning, finding out it is Latin and Arab. When it comes to the Vikings, I as a Norwegian couldn't get a complete hand on what they spoke, but took a guess it might have been some kind of Danish. However when the Kings son spoke, I could confirm that Norwegian was spoken in this movie.For me, I don't really know many ""Big movies"" containing Norwegian, so this was a nice surprise. To bad it didn't last the whole movie, but it still beats X-Files episode where they travel to Norway, but where they speak Danish.The language was basically the biggest thrill for me, but still this movie manage to have a fair deal of action. A little setback for me was that I expected some ""real"" fighting, and not against some bear people. I give this movie 7.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A few comments (long),"I feel the need to comment to a few of the reviews I read from the first page, which I must say were totally off-base.A few notes, at random, and in no particular order.Several reviewers are evidently confused about the relationship of the movie to a textual source. Specifically, they don't get the point, because they misunderstand what it's trying to do. The movie is based on the novel ""Eaters of the Dead"", by Michael Crichton. This novel is a fictionalized history, written in the form of an epic translation (which it isn't), and recounts what happens when a group of Norsemen, accompanied by an Arab observer end up at war with a remnant population of Neandertals. Yes, Neandertals. It's not completely ridiculous, though the most recent evidence for neandertals that I know of (I'm an archaeologist) in northern Europe is about 25k before present. It didn't happen -- it's just Crichton's device, and it's a fun one. Neandertals are very close to modern people, but not the same. They are in some sense Other, and to xenophobes like medieval Norse they must have seemed, well, something like Grendel is discribed in Beowulf. When Crichton wrote this, originally in the 1970s, even less was known of Neandertals than now, thus the brutish characterization, exaggerated a bit by the movie.Once this background is adequately understood, several criticisms should disappear:A. One reviewer complains that the movie isn't faithful enough to the original text, apparently believing in this case the text written by Ahmed ibn-Fahlan, and published a few years ago. This reviewer appears unaware that this is a literary conceit on the part of the actual author, Michael Crichton.B. Meanwhile, a second reviewer complains that the movie is insufficiently close to the Beowulf myth. As implied by the above, this criticism goes nowhere, because it is not a simple retelling of Beowulf. ""Eaters of the Dead"" is Crichton's effort to fictionally historicize Beowulf by placing it in the context of a struggle of Norse against a remnant population of neandertals. ""The 13th Warrior"" is a pretty accurate retelling of the encounter as envisioned by Crichton, and its relationship to Beowulf is as tangential as Crichton's.C. A review complains about the ragged mobs of bad guys, clad in bear skins for no good reason. The reason is that there is good evidence to suppose Neandertals had a ritual life oriented in some way around cave bears. They might be ragged mobs because the book, and movie, are emphasizing their primitiveness, relative to the modern humans they are fighting. I had more difficulty with Neandertal cavalry, but there isn't any particular reason to believe a remnant population of Neandertals couldn't observe the use of domesticated horses, steal some, and figure it out from there.D. I didn't think that was the lamest love interest subplot ever by far. First, the woman was gorgeous, so it can't be a waste. (heh, okay) Second, it underscores the relatively casual attitude of the norse toward sex, especially as initiated by women. This is obviously not a universal trait in medieval western cultures, and is a nice historical touch. It would have been sappier if he'd stayed or she'd followed, but neither happens. It's a moment of comfort and connection in a hopeless situation, and works well in that context.E. We have no idea how a complex Neandertal society might work -- there's no evidence to suggest they might ever have had one. For them to coalesce briefly around a few charismatic leaders, and disperse when those leaders die, is no stretch at all. In fact, it's the most likely scenario. I'm not that'd happen in the middle of a battle, but maybe it would. Who knows? After all, if they had a structured society that *didn't* depend on the presence of charismatic leaders, they'd be more visible in the archaeological record, and might have been more of a threat. It'd be a different situation, certainly. Anyway, it's Crichton's story and it works.I have no particular rebuttal to those who didn't like the characters or the acting or whatever, except to say I think they're dead wrong. And the reviewer suggesting this as MST2K material ... well...evidently doesn't know much about 13th Warrior OR MST2K. (Trying to be nice here). Hint: MST2K makes fun of *bad* movies, not good ones. I love the characters and thought the chemistry was terrific. Visually, it's stunning.The movie just works great on a lot of levels. It's just a quietly great movie. Certainly on my top 10 list, and probably top 5. A lot of my friends avoided it in the theater, but when I show them the video, I haven't seen anyone not like it. I think it will have a solid second life. It should.(Apologies for length)",10.0,Anonymous,History
Great Adventure!,"The 13th Warrior is great adventure of myth, magic and bravery.  As has already been said, Antonio Banderas is a civilized Arab in the land of the Vikings in this well done adaptation by Michael Crichton's of his novel Eaters of the Dead.  The Crichton book is in itself an adaptation of the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf.Crichton has crafted a clever tale that contrasts the educated, sophisticated and civilized Arab poet against the decidedly less than civilized Vikings.  The journey from southern Russia (where the story begins) back to the Viking homeland becomes a period of adjustment and learning for both sides and also creates most of the humor.  The funniest scene in the movie is caused by the Vikings' contempt for their Arab guest's ""little"" horse.  To prove the quality of his Arabian, Banderas jumps it over the head of his loudest critic who is mounted on a large Viking horse.  It is a gesture the Vikings, who live by their physical prowess, understand and find as funny as the audience. It is the beginning of respect for their strange guest and the real beginning of their comradeship.  They travel north to save a Viking king from a savage tribe that raids his lands killing, not only his undefended farmers in their isolated homestead, but also his warriors as they sleep in his fortified hall.  This savage ""bear totem"" tribe eat their fallen victims and are the ""Eaters of the Dead"" in the title of the novel.  They use mist and magic to frighten and paralyze the superstitious Vikings.  It is the sophisticated Arab with his educated belief in Aristotelian rationalism and his devout belief in one good God, Allah, that sees through the tricks of the enemy to the mortal men behind the magic.Taken together, these elements blend into a tale of myth and magic and bravery and comradeship that transcends culture.  It also creates a great adventure with some spectacular scenery, swordsmanship and spooky danger. If you like swords and magic and bravery, you will like The 13th Warrior.",7.0,Anonymous,History
silly battle scenes,"'The 13th Warrior' is an action/adventure film about a group of Viking warriors. Although there were some good ideas, I felt that they failed to come to life in this film. The characters could have been more interesting than they were, and they feel distant. The story really fails to engage because of the characters and the overall methods in which the story is told. However, the battle scenes were done well, except some of the events taking place turned out to be funny rather than serious. (The sound effects and some of the scenes of heads getting slashed, people doing miraculous killing moves against the odds, horses leaping in the nick of time to safety, over-acting character emotions, and showing a lot of gore for the sake of gore were silly.)

The Norsemen and the Arab,"From the ancient scrolls of the Northland Vikings, comes this fantastic tale of Beowulf and Grendal the Sea Monster. However for the record the name of the legendary story, has been changed to ""The Thirteenth Warrior."" In this incredible epic, as narrated by the exiled lover of princess Shaharazad, the storyteller, an Arab poet, is appointed ambassador to the Nomads in the far-away Barbar country. On route, he is accepted as the thirteen warrior and invited to join a group of adventurous Vikings who are requested to return to the mother country to defend the villagers against a monstrous flesh eating peoples called the Wendol. (Also known as the Vendall or Cannibals) In the process, the fearless Vikings learn as much about the courageous Arab as he learns about them, their language, customs and their military skills. Antonio Banderas, plays Ahmed Ibn Rashid Ibn Hamad and is convincing as the curious, but knowledgeable Arabian envoy. Vladimir Kulich, plays Buliwyf, The 1st Warrior and is capable and extremely formidable in his chieftain's role. With Dennis Storhøi as Herger the Joyous and Daniel Southern as Edgtho the Silent, the group encounter the Vandall, their leader and their mother. Although they fight to protect the Viking people, they in-turn risk their very lives against hoards of bear-face savages, who use both Witchcraft and horn blaring attacks. With nail biting action and mysterious drama, the film proves exciting and memorable. A great film for Banderas' fans. ****",9.0,Anonymous,History

The Arab, Antonio Banderas, is chosen to help them out.The story line was predictable but that doesn't mean it has to fail....but the feeling of ""wow this is entertainment just never started"". The movie gave me the feeling that they insinuated more then that they worked out....u have a love affair, intrigue possibilities, great battles but instead of going deeper on that they just merely touched the surface of the story...To summarise: this is an entertaining movie but they just cut half of the storyline away......No need to see this one!!!",4.0,Anonymous,History

"Liked it when it first screened, still like it 23 years later!","For those who haven't seen it, T13W is loosely based on the English poem Beowulf, had battles, gore, tons of extras, practical effects and Northmen; no CGI whatsoever.

No brainer for certain but then again, it was a summer flick, and a fun one at that!! The best part is because it doesn't rely on CG effects, this movie doesn't age, apart from the gore, which may look better with what's available today.Always found it odd that this movie was panned by critics and performed poorly in the box office. Even the late Omar Sharif purportedly retired from acting in disgust for his part in it.. I can only surmise that it flopped because of the quality of movies that were being released at that time, and the lack of star power.

Severelly underrated masterpiece,"OK, let's get things straight: The 13th Warrior isn't a masterpiece in the sense we use for ""Citizen Kane"", for example. As some have already pointed out, the plot is quite thin (even if you have to be totally illiterate in order not to figure out this wants to be a re-interpretation of Beowulf) and has some bad inconsistencies. Of course there's no way an Arab (speaking a semitic language) would learn old Norse (indo-european language) in a few weeks by just listening etc etc etc.HOWEVER, this isn't what this movie is about. The 13th Warrior is just a vehicle made to get the modern-day man in touch with the ""kill or be killed"", ""stand your ground or everyone in your village dies"" spirit. I mean, if the scene where Buliwyf barely drags his feet (and his sword) to stand in the way of the incoming onslaught of the primitive's cavalry charge doesn't fill you with adrenaline (and with the sudden urge to grab a damn spear or something) it means that you're either a old woman or... (well, let's not go there, you know what I mean :D )On top of that, I'm willing to bet that many of the bad reviews are actually caused by the very positive depiction that this film gives to Arabs. Add positive view on Arabs to Norse mythology and you easily can figure out why some critics will rate this movie as complete crap. Well, it isn't.Someone wrote here (with acted disgust) that this is a movie for men who like to bang their chest with their fists (gorilla style). Well, I ask you: should we completely forget what we're actually made of? :D",9.0,Anonymous,History
Blood-stained historical adventure.,"The Thirteenth Warrior went through a difficult production history and in many ways the finished film - though entertaining - is a shadow of what it could have been. Antonio Banderas plays the hero, an 11th century Arab poet who finds himself in very strange surroundings indeed.He becomes the 13th member of a Norse expedition as they travel to the frozen north, intending to rid their homeland of its fierce enemies. Some very nasty tribesmen have been slaying the villagers and ripping away their heads, leaving people in fear and communities in ruin. The 13 Norse warriors are the only hope that people have of regaining their lives.Jerry Goldsmith's music is rousing throughout, especially during the battle scenes. Banderas gives a good performance as the bewildered hero, fighting for a cause about which he doesn't really understand. The action is filmed well, with brutal battles and narrow escapes shot in convincingly bloodthirsty detail. However, the characterisation is sketchy, with few of the warriors developed in a particularly meaningful way. Also, the occasional attempts to get a romantic storyline going are terribly weak, almost as if much of the footage was left on the cutting room floor. This film never fulfils its potential. It is fun to watch, but it could have been a first-rate epic.",6.0,Anonymous,History

So no tension in the battle scenes.I found it interesting that it was filmed in British Columbia, Canada.

Good Viking Adventure -- Could've Been Great,"The story of ""The 13th Warrior"" (1999) comes from Michael Crichton's novel ""The Eaters of the Dead"" which combines the legend of Beowulf with a historical account of an Arab diplomat who meets and dwells with the Vikings after being banished from his homeland due to an adulterous liaison.Antonio Banderas stars as the Arab while the hulking Vladimir Kulich heads the Viking cast in the Beowulf role of Buliwyf (pronounced in the film BULL-vie). Speaking of Kulich, he would've made for an excellent Mighty Thor back in the day!The plot of the film is great: Once Banderas meets up with the Vikings, they run afoul of a mysterious brutal tribe from the deep woods. Banderas is selected as the lone non-Viking to assist the 12 Norsemen in ridding the communities of the threat, hence ""the 13th warrior."" The cast, characters, story, locations (Campbell River, Vancouver Island), sets, costumes, score (Jerry Goldsmith), and cinematography are all of the highest order.At a little over an hour and a half the film moves along briskly with a lot of action. Make no mistake, ""The 13th Warrior"" is a Class A film, but some story elements seem to be underdeveloped. This is probably due to the conflict Michael Crichton had with director John McTiernan. Crichton insisted on reshoots and cut at least 30 minutes of McTiernan's work, reportedly important character-developing scenes.We see this in the very prologue of the film: The story of Banderas' banishment from his homeland due to his indiscretions is literally relayed in a matter of a couple minutes. And at the 8 minute mark we are introduced to the Vikings with very little mystery and zero suspense build-up. The contrast of the sophisticated Arab culture with the coarse, rugged Norsemen is great, but I would have enjoyed seeing these characters fleshed-out a bit more. After all, the more we know the individuals, the more we care about what ultimately happens to them.Which brings us to the final 30 minutes of the film involving Banderas and the Vikings infiltrating the malevolent tribe's stronghold and a final attack on a Viking village. The visuals of these scenes are awe-inspiring but they fly by so quickly that the viewer is left disoriented and strangely uninvolved, not to mention unmoved by the story's outcome.All this reveals that ""The 13th Warrior"" COULD have been an outstanding 140-minute Viking epic, along the lines of ""Troy"" (2004); instead we are left with a brisk, action-oriented, near-throwaway Viking popcorn flick. I would love to see a Director's Cut some day but Vladimir Kulich opines that it will unfortunately never happen.Nonetheless, I appreciate the film as is. It's a good Viking adventure flick that's professionally done, despite the post-production problems. It's one of those films that gets better with each viewing, probably because everything flies by so quickly on initial plays.Despite it's flaws, ""The 13th Warrior"" isn't too far from rivaling Kirk Douglas' brilliant 1958 ""The Vikings"" as one of the greatest Viking films ever made. A Director's Cut could possibly even topple ""The Vikings"" from its lofty, coveted perch.The film was shot in British Columbia: Campbell River on Vancouver Island, Williams Lake and Pemberton, British Columbia.GRADE: B-/B.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Good movie but needed a longer running time,Antonio Banderas stars in this action filled re-telling of Norse legend. As an Arabian warrior he is taken with 12 Scandanavian warriors to do battle with a mysterious foe deep in the wilderness in order to save a village from extinction. Filled with action what this film lacks is some more time on character and story development to give it that epic feel. Performances and direction are good but it feels like you never really get to know anymore than one or two of the heroes so consequently you never feel involved when they are in peril and ultimately when some die. The ending is also confusing and doesn't make to much sense when you think about it.Overall this is an enjoyable movie that with a little more could have gone from a 6/10 to an 8 or 9.Not in the same league as Lord of the Rings or even Conan!

I mean - isn't it strange that Antonio Banderas, who in my opinion ruined a promising career after a splendid international start (Mambo Kings) raises high with his Arab part. Don't you agree it took guts and charisma to stand above all those never-before-in-film perfect and powerful Vikings?

Reasons to watch The Thirteenth  Warrior,"It is so very rare in film or stage to have the serendipity of a very fine actor physically, vocally, and energetically, melded with the character he is depicting to become one of the few who elevate acting into something mystical and deeply memorable.

Dennis Stohoi's Herger the Joyous in ""The Thirteenth Warrior"" accomplished that.It is also a travesty that such a performance is not given its full recognition and stature in the world of film-making.

a contradictory effort for historical authenticity,"I did see this movie in television and liked it. My point is that while in the beginning it strives to be an accurate portrayal of the life style and customs of the early medieval Norsemen and in a lesser degree Arabs the introduction of the human flesh eating Wendols brings an air of unreality in the whole movie. Either you try to be historically accurate or you play on the supernatural element, you can't do both in my opinion at least.On the other hand as the movie progresses the supernatural identity of the human flesh eating Wendols is dispelled and they are revealed as humans dressed in the garments of bears, living in caves, eating human flesh, very primitive but humans nevertheless without any relationship with animalistic or supernatural elements, as the Arab hero played by Antonio Banderas is the first to discover.The problem is that in this otherwise accurate portrayal of 10nth century A.D. world, inhabited by human beings as diverse as cultivated Arabs and rough Norsemen, where do this human flesh eating, bear garment bearing people, the Wendols, sprung from? Of course one could argue that their practices are not so appalling by the standards of the age since we know that during the barbarian invasions and latter during the Crusades, cases of cannibalism have been recorded.As for the sacrifice of human beings to appease a deity, this was massively practiced even latter in history by the Aztecs in Mexico, while widows were cast in the funeral pire of the husbands even in 19nth century British India.Therefore one could argue that the Wendols are not so exceptional by historical standards after all. Still in the movie their existence is rather unexplained and one can say that the differ from both Arabs and Norsemen in a considerable degree.Otherwise there is an effort to present the age in an accurate manner, the costumes and the practices of the heroes to appear in an authentic manner. The relationship of the outsider Arab with the Norsemen is developed in an able manner as well as his gradual integration to their group and his acceptance of their values.The movie is quite frightening and has scenes of violence, battles and human corpses eaten or skeletons exposed. The Wendols are very frightening in the beginning and even latter when their simply ""human"" identity is gradually revealed.The development of the characters is fine and some of the Norsemen become from uncouth barbarians human beings of endearing qualities that one can empathize with.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Lame Warrior,"I'm a big Antonio Banderas fan, but this movie just didn't work for me. The acting wasn't bad, but the whole premise of the movie was preposterous. I've never heard of vikings in Vancouver, and there was nothing close to resembling ice or snow, just rain. The mystique of some fabled viking monster had initial appeal, but failed to materialize. What we ended up with was basically little more than a cowboys and Indians flick in the northwest. Memo to the writer: There were no cowboys and Indians battles in Vancouver. Never. Get it? And the warriors were so outnumbered, it there was no way they didn't end up in a gift shop.As good an actor as Banderas is, he just didn't seem to be into this movie. His theme seems to be hot-blooded latino, not Arab and not viking. I think he would rather have been in a bull fight movie or something. Or maybe the bogus factor of the movie was too much for him. His trying to convert the Vikings to Islam also seemed delusional. Da, I think the 13th warrior was supposed to become more like a Viking, no? Why in the heck would a Norseman care about Allah? And doesn't he know it's rude for a stranger to try to convert the host? He didn't even give them a chance to teach him some words, like a savante or something, he picked it up just sitting at the campfire and listening. Right. If the viking was visiting the Arab, he would have to sit polite and be taught their ways etc. So the movie tried to be politically correct or something. Yuck.

A Lord of the Ring kind of tale with historical background,"A nice surprise to find a story we all heard of in school so well done on the screen!In school we read about the Arab who encountered Vikings far away from their homeland, and the film follows his description thoroughly (beautiful but dirty people). After that the film is fantasy, despite some mythological base.Clothing and settings are more of the modern Icelandic Viking film style than of the old Hollywood one, which is very good (although houses and clothes are a bit fanciful, but at least there are no Viking helmets with horns). They have tried to make Viking behaviour believable and have managed all right there, if you have read Nordic sagas.In our country we prefer to hear people talk the language they are supposed to speak on the screen, but in a Hollywood production like this we can here at least hear Nordic languages spoken for a time.I particularly like the way the film showed how the Arab (Banderas) learns the Nordic language.As a whole: an alright adventure story with a good ancient atmosphere.",,Anonymous,History
Too few of these movies,"I truly like these kind of ""north men movies"" but then there is also many things that disturbed me during the movie. First is that the vikings who came as far to the middle east were the vikings from the area of Sweden, but in this movie those vikings speak norwegian which would not make sense at all if you would just look at a world map. Of course I understood all of the norwegian that were spoken, it's very similair. And when they got to Scandinavia I saw trees I have never seen (filmed in canada). Then too that Antonio Banderas does not do very good acting. So last I say is that I would really want them to have spoken Swedish since they were in the area where the Swedish vikings were.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Inspiring and entertaining,"A lot of people slate this movie for its lack of plot, its supposedly weak story line and apparently poor acting and minimalistic scenes. I would like to remind those people that 13th Warrior is set in a place where expansive scenarios don't just appear and landscapes are not necessary when the movie is based around such a small area. The acting was exactly as I imagine it would be if the characters in the film were real people and the events that took place were real. Every one of the characters in the film seemed on cue in my opinion - which is obviously what these reviews represent - my opinions. And in my opinion, you cannot fault the acting. As for plot... The 13th Warrior is a superb fest of testosterone, larger than life characters and a simple course of events as seen from an outsider. There is no need for complex or boring plots and stories. The film isn't meant to satisfy only those who want such complexities; the same people who would discard any fantasy movie as being too ""unreal"". The 13th Warrior delivers. The inspiration I receive every time I watch this film - and I believe it is about once a month that I put it on again - is staggering. I love it entirely and cannot find a single reason to fault it - other than it is too short.If you can suspend your belief's and allow yourself to just absorb an action fantasy film, this should delight. If it doesn't, then I pity you.",10.0,Anonymous,History
what history can tell us,"I found 13th warrior to be both entertaining and broadly accurate, especially in its depiction of codes of personal honor and the portrayal of pre-materialist views of reality. I even use parts of the movie for a college-level course on Medieval Europe.Some comments:the memoirs of Ibn Faldn - a real person- is the source only for the burial scene at the first of the movie; the ""Wendol"" were evidently extreme berserkers (bear+sark or skin) There are documented cases in the 1100's-1200's, but most were wolves not bears;the mixture of ethnic groups was quite common - warriors went where they could win fame and gold.

From then to now this is what I think.,"From the first time I've seen this movie to this day, I just love the way this movie was filmed. I like how it used the vikings and one of their superstitions! It added a humor in with all the violence that had gone on. There was a wish to stop the ""monsters"" and protect the brethren. I loved the prayer that was said when the Princess was burned with the father at the beginning of the movie, and when they remaining Warriors at the end of the movie. When The movie began I thought it was going to be boring, but as it went on it got better and more enjoyable. I found the humor amusing just by the way it was put in. For Example: the vikings laughing and barking at his horse, because it was smaller than theirs. Slowly I stated to understand the plot and the point of the movie and just found it all interesting and great to watch.All around it was interesting to watch and see what people believe the Vikings did for one another.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Interesting Play On An Old Legend,"I really enjoyed this film being that it took an old legend and made an interesting, newer version of it that keeps you interested from beginning to end. As far as action films go, it is a terrific film that really speaks to the senses with beautiful fight sequences and imagery. If you enjoy a good battle scene this is definitely a good film for you, being that there is no shortage of them.The film also depicts a good sense of brotherhood amongst everyone, and sort of how people of great differences can come together in the face of opposition to accomplish things. Although the content of the story is not very profound and that I did not fight the acting particularly provocative or good, I still felt as if it was a very good action film and was definitely worth watching. If you are in the mood for medieval battle scenes, you cannot go wrong with this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Fine, but that's all.","I watched the 13th two days ago with my girl friend, who graduated as a BA of English Literature. Having studied _Beowulf_ when she was in college, she loved the film. But I was more conservative about it.The most visible difference between the movie and the novel was the viewpoint. The book was composed as two parts: ibn Fadlan's 1st person narrative, and the scholar's voice in footnotes that acts as a 3rd person omniscient (or smartass) viewer. The movie only follows ibn Fadlan's line. Its viewpoint was closer to _Beowulf_, many of Crichton's inventions were removed, something as the Neanderthalian hypothesis.The movie was designed to be a testosterone-rich saga. Ibn Fadlan turned to be a he-man in nearly no time. You can see him display his masculinity in front of the Vikings shortly after he was kidnapped. You just don't have the idea why and when he became stronger, and was willing to fight for these barbarians. (Hint: watch for the quickest language lesson in the history of movie making.)To sell the movie as a superhero film, they omitted some flavorable parts in Crichton's original. Say the whale part. Why should these Vikings fear a whale? Wasn't a whale supposed to be a kid's best friend? Didn't you see _Free Willy_ before? But the whale part was one of the most interesting part in the _Eaters of the Dead_, and came straight from the first paragraph of _Beowulf_ (whale-road as the ocean). It made the film less tasty to skip the whale part.As the movie's title implied, the show was focused on the 13th warrior solely. Throughout the film, the rest 12 of them were neglected, including Buliwyf, the one created by Crichton as his own Beowulf. You didn't know much about him, not to mention the others. Some warriors remained faceless and nameless until they died. Then you learned about their names postmortem. And after the show, you still didn't have a clue about how many of them survived. All you could see was Antonio, Antonio, and Antonio. That's why the movie bugged me most.Otherwise it was viewable. And I'll very probably see it again. It was entertaining. But that was all. It could be better if the film was more complete. I mean the edition showed in Taiwan was only about 95 minutes long which was 20 minutes shorter than the US edition. It was rated R in the US while PG in Taiwan. So it was clear that I did not see the whole picture.",2.0,Anonymous,History
Entertaining and Enjoyable Viking Hero Epic,"The 13th Warrior is an enjoyable and Entertaining Film Version of Michael Critchton's Eaters of the Dead and is a retelling of the Old Angelo-Saxon Epic Poem Beowulf. The Northmen are an amusing and intimidating bunch, although they look a little old, with exception to Banderas and Dennis Storhoi, who is excellent in his Hollywood debut the Northmen are well over 6 fee tall. The Wendols are appropriately murky and misty, the action is quite good. The performances are fairly good with exception to Diane Venora, and Omar Shariff, who exits quickly after picking up a nice paycheck. Vladimir Kulich, makes a great action hero without saying much. His imposing prescence and heroic performance are the best thing about the movie. Maybe only Arnold could have played a better Buliwyf. The film was delayed for about 2 years and Michael Critchton stepped in to do reshoots. The re-edited Critchton version is shorter than the McTiernan cut, which was released. For a little the alleged big production run a muck talk the film is very solid and never dull. The cinematography is good, the sword play fantastic.

The 13th warrior is of course, Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan (Banderas), a poet who was expelled from his homeland after coveting the beauty of a noble's wife. Resigned to his role as an ambassador and accompanied by a family friend, Melchisidek (played by the excellent Omar Sharif), he gets more than he wagered by being named by a soothsayer to help the nordic warriors in their quest.What follows is really a growth story for the main character, who shows his true worth when his time of testing comes.I've read ""Eaters of the Dead"" and to be honest I much prefer this adaption!",,Anonymous,History

Except there are not that many movie with that theme. Based on Crichton's short novel ""Eaters of the Dead"" (Crichton reportedly had a hand in the direction of the movie), this is an old-fashioned adventure movie. Crichton made the book as a blend from the real chronicles of an Arab traveler to the land of the Norsemen and the well known story of Beowulf.

Personal Review,"i have read the book and also seen the theatrical movie.  hopefully this makes me more of an objective critic.  through following this story there are two points i wish to address, first being the authenticity of the story.from what i have read. the movie does justice to the documentation provided by the book. there are of course items in the book which cannot be properly illustrated by the film only because much of what occurs is due to the readers fantasy, i have not known any director to be able to illustrate this without some variants.  it even seems improbable that a director could make it echo that of your specific account, in reading the subject.I think that this theatrical attempt is one of the best, true to text efforts that you will find.  the movie provides a vehicle to learn or experience the characters in a different manner than reading about the events, which from the account of the narrator are somewhat bland and overly factual.this is a great effort to stay true to the story provided and i personally find that the strange connection and distance that you encounter with the main characters convey the true meaning of what it would be like to experience an event like this - that is without the language and social skills of the environment one is thrust into.so on the whole i think that this is a respectable attempt to recreate the story as documented, without taking too much license at ""artistic additions"" in the film version.  i find that you become attached to the characters even without knowing their names or understanding them on a ""language"" scale. this story is truly about a foreign interaction and a textbook style accounting of the events that haunted the main character even after the experience.excellent for those looking for a real story and not just special effects to entertain.",10.0,Anonymous,History
fish out of water action thriller,"Ahmad Ibn Fadlan (Antonio Banderas) is a carefree poet in Baghdad. After falling for the wrong woman, he's banished to the barbaric far north as an ambassador. His caravan is attacked by Tartars and is rescued by a passing Viking longboat. Melchisidek (Omar Sharif) is his loyal companion. He is shocked by their customs. An ancient evil that must not be named threatens the Vikings and their seer prophesy that 13 warriors must be sent. The 13th must be no Northman and Ahmad is pushed into joining.I really like the idea of a cultured Arab trying to fit in with the crude Vikings. It has a bit of fun with the fish out of water concept. Director John McTiernan is too in love with the dark muddy battle. Most of all, the Vikings don't stand out as individual. Thirteen is probably too many. There is a long cinematic tradition with seven. If the group could be reduced, some of them have a better chance to stand out.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Avid Merrion Stars In A Crap Film,"I saw THE 13TH WARRIOR immediately after seeing the surreal and funny comedy show BO SELECTA and I couldn't help noticing that Antonio Banderas voice resembles Avid Merrion . I couldn't help laughing every time Banderas's character Ahmed Fadlan opened his mouth to add narration to the story , when he said "" We traveled to the lands of the north "" I kept expecting him to say "" So I could meet some really sexy blonde ladies , ah really really lurve Abi Titmuss ""Seeing as this brought amusement to the proceedings I'm glad I was reminded of Avid Merrion because that's the only entertainment to be had by the first hour of this movie whose narrative is entirely taken up by Ahmed traveling with a group of viking warriors to the lands of the north which is even less exciting than it sounds . The lack of involvement for the audience isn't helped by a ridiculous revelation that Ahmed can understand the viking's language after all and up until this point we have to watch large sections of the movie where no English is spoken . Wouldn't it have been far better to have the characters understand each others language right from the start of the film no matter who illogical this would have been ?So after an hour where nothing of any interest happens the film settles down to its main plot of having the Avid Merrion soundalike and his multi-lingual mates protecting the Nordic people from an army of cannibalistic redneck scumbags . Again I don't want to give the impression that this sounds exciting in anyway because it's not . Director John McTiernan at the time was well regarded because of his work on DIE HARD , THE HUNT FOR RED October and PREDATOR and is probably now best remembered for the debacle that is the ROLLERBALL remake you get an idea how variable his can be . The battle scenes in THE 13TH WARRIOR are probably the worst action scenes of McTiernan's career , they're badly edited and so darkly lit that it's almost impossible to see what's taking place on screen . Compared to Ridley Scott's work on GLADIATOR and most especially Peter Jackson's THE TWO TOWERS the battle scenes here are very poor indeed and I'm at a loss to understand the relatively high rating by IMDb voters . I give THE 13TH WARRIOR three out of ten",3.0,Anonymous,History
Beautiful,"This movie, based on a Michael Crichton novel ""Eaters of the Dead"" is a movie that incorporates the human necessities of survival, brotherhood, and the urge to protect the weak.Antonio Banderas plays an Arab exiled, or made an ambassador, for improper conduct. He is sent North, and comes into the company of, for lack of a better term, Vikings, or North Men.A messenger arrives and asks for aid against an ancient evil that must not be named. 13 warriors must go, and the last must not be a North Man. And so, Banderas is chosen.The movie shows Banderas being outcast at first, then eventually earning trust and faith and even the friendship of the North Men. It has more than it's share of blood and sword fighting in it, and it's got the most incredible line in at the end. Not going to spoil it.I find this movie to be exceptionally well done, if not slightly cheesed up. Most of the main cast does die, so at least we can be thankful it was completely cheese. I give this movie a resounding 10/10, for authenticity, bloodbaths, and good fight scenes!",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Poor man's ""Braveheart""","Banderas plays the 13th warrior in this clumsy adventure flick about a bunch of badass Vikings who duke it out with the mysterious Wendol....yeah, right. The story is ill-conceived and poorly laid out with some dialogue shuffling in the beginning to get everyone speaking the same language. Fight sequences are tightly shot and poorly staged and overall the film is lackluster.  No sex or nudity...just a lot of blood & guts. Nonetheless, there is a certain masculine charm about the devil-may-care way the Vikings live to die which makes this worth watching if you need something to go with your popcorn.Footnote: I was surprised by the number of user comments for this flick on IMDB.com.

Tense battle sequences--poorly developed script and characters. ** out of ****.,"THE 13TH WARRIOR (1999) **Starring: Antonio Banderas, Diane Venora, Vladimir Kulich, Omar Sharif, and Anders T. Andersen Director: John McTiernan   Co-written and directed by Michael Crichton 114 minutes   Rated R (for brutal warfare violence and gory carnage)By Blake French:Michael Crichton is a very good writer. Way too good for being responsible for much of the production of ""The 13th Warrior,"" a brutal Viking film in which everything is first rate except the characters and the story. True, the film does contain a few moments of suspense and tension that work well. However, nothing in this movie even remotely compares to any of his past work, such as ""Jurassic Park"" or ""Sphere."" Also, director John McTiernan, who has also contributed his direction to some great movies, such as the original ""Die Hard,"" is completely lost in Crichton's story here, which, in a way, leads to a directional conflict that is almost like the blind leading the blind.Antonio Banderas stars as a humble Arab poet named Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan, Ibn for short, who lives a pretty normal 18th century life until he is chosen, along with twelve other brave men, to defend a king's plummeting kingdom from vicious, unknown slaughters who consumer the dead. His life dramatically changes as he defends his leaders and his own life by fighting off these man-eating beasts.Finding out who the villains are in this movie is truthfully the only reason to even consider going to the multiplex to see it; they are mysterious and devilish. Part of their identity is revealed in a dramatic war sequence that gives away the wrong information at the wrong time. If only the filmmakers offered an answer to this provoking question: we never actually find out who they are or where they come from. Too bad, if the audience was provided with answers, we may have had something a little bit noteworthy here.Another problem I had with ""The 13th Warrior"" has to do with its plot, which was seemed to be absent for much of the film. The characters are good speakers; they explain most of the story to us, with simple and blank dialogue that doesn't include any dramatic impulse in its being--the plot is never directly shown. This dialogue is also used to develop most of the characters. Banderas is detailed though some neat flashbacks, but not even those scenes will make you care about any of the characters.There is much to like about the production, however. The battle sequences build up enough tension to make them work well, mostly because of the mystery of the villains. There is a nice (meaning the scene works, not that the scene is ""nice"") scene in a cave near the end of the film that has lost of smart material in its writing--but again, we just don't care about any of the characters; it is hard to build up tension if we don't care about who lives or who dies. In addition, there is a tremendously over-looked production design  worthy of an Oscar nomination.Antonio Banderas delivers a good performance, one that fits the lead role so perfectly that I myself could not have chosen another actor to fit the role better. His character is too shallow to give recognition to, but Banderas does what he can to make his character bearable.I do believe that ""The 13th Warrior"" was destined to succeed. If the writers would have done  what they should have done, considering the potential here, this film would have surely worked. There are  many ways that would have made this material work. For instance, Antonio Banderas stars as a brute, powerful leader of thirteen warriors who are forced into defending their king's fortune. Or perhaps, Antonio Banderas as the leader of a band of scavengers numbering thirteen who are somehow selected to protect their territory from the legendary ""eaters of the dead."" But how in God's green Earth could one take such clever potential and write a story starring Antonio Banderas as some meek, insignificant Arab poet who is chosen by some unknown, distant king to fight for a dyeing nation and protected its citizens from man-eaters whose presence is never explained?

A Classic,"It was only by accident that I purchased the video of The 13th Warrior, and I had to force myself to watch it. But by the end of the first 30 minutes, I was hooked, and to date have replayed it five times. Even after six viewings in total, I am still noticing new minor but significant details.I have no doubt that The 13th Warrior will one day be considered as one of the best films of the 20th century, ranking alongside The Seven Samurai, 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Great Escape (to name just three movies that share some of its characteristics) as a cinematic landmark action/adventure. Michael Crichton has served a long apprenticeship as an author, and is renowned for the detail and accuracy with which he fills his books. In The 13th Warrior, he borrows on the directional skills of luminaries as diverse and notable as John Ford, Howard Hawks, Alfred Hitchcock, Akira Kurosawa, Stanley Kubrick and George Lucas to design a film that fully utilises the visual medium. The 13th Warrior is so heavily packed with visual and verbal detail that the viewer cannot afford to be distracted for even a moment.This movie is not one that will appeal to everyone, and is definitely unsuitable for anyone who will not give it the undivided attention it needs to be fully understood. Banderas is perfectly cast as the exiled Arab diplomat, Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan, experienced in verbal skills and subtle but complex political intrigues. He performs well in his role as the counterpoint to the Viking warriors, typified by the Viking leader Buliwyf (played by Vladimir Kulich), complementing their skills understanding the visual and the simply obvious. This complementary difference is probably best explained by Ahmed when he explains how he learned his companions' Norse language: ""I listened!""; Buliwyf responds by explaining how he could write a complicated Arabic phrase after seeing it just once, weeks earlier: ""I watched!""The basic plot of the movie is simple: Banderas is chosen as the non-Norseman member of a mystical party of 13 warriors who are needed to combat an invasion by a mystery horde of flesheating invaders, the Wendol (who seem to be modelled on the ancient Picts). It is his different viewpoint that helps the small group to victory, and along the way this soft Arab diplomat suffers his rite of passage to manhood. The starkly realistic depiction of the harsh Norseman lifestyle, juxtaposed with the civilised culture Ahmed prefers, is portrayed without the cinematic excesses we have come to associate with action movies, and the total package of excellent acting, characterisation and cinematography easily earns a 9 out of 10 from me.",,Anonymous,History

Omar Al-Sharif also guest stars at the beginning of the movie for a few scenes, but as always, he adds more weight to the movie.The most brilliant part in the film is how the director showed Ahmad Ibn Fadlan picking up the nordic language of the vikings, gradually.

At least the storyline must have been left there. All that is left is a series of bloody encounters.

Antonio Banderas was not too bad inThe Mask of Zorro (1998), where he had a chance to act instead of slashing quasi-mythical bears.If you took the blood away this movie would more resembleA Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (1949)where Bing Crosby gets to ride his pony around the larger but slower Knights.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Lo there do I see my father. Lo there do I see my mother and my sisters and my brothers,"To say that this is one of my favorite movies is an understatement. I have watched this movie more times than I can remember. Each time is a wonderful experience. The movie is backwards and forwards everything I want in a movie. A sweeping epic tale of warriors, danger, the unknown, battles, fear, pain, sadness, victory, death, happiness, different cultures, love, hopelessness, beauty and everything that makes a person human. A simple man from a completely different way of life is thrust into what would become his worst nightmare.Antonio Banderas might not pass for an Eastern-born character but he plays his part masterfully. He is taken from his life of care-free luxury and transplanted into a world of war and death. The legendary Viking warriors have little time for someone who is not a fighter. They scoff at Ahmed and see him as no more than a child in their world. His transformation from an outcast to a warrior at the end is no less than breathtaking. Through hardship and trial Ahmed proves himself as capable as any of Buliwyf's fellow Vikings.The cinematography is equally stunning as are all the performances in this film. It shows a brutal landscape with equally brutal people living in them. The score for the film is fantastic as well. Jerry Goldsmith masterfully weaves epic battles into moments of unease and then to triumph. It is a sad thing that the production of this movie failed it so completely. The director and the writer both could not come together as to what story they wanted to make and combined with the advertisement and setbacks it undid whatever success this movie could have achieved. I for one love this movie and am grateful to be able to experience it each and every time.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The 13th Warrior,"This is my kind of film, and so despite that rather dodgy casting of Antonio Banderas - indeed, the pretty ropey casting throughout - I still rather enjoyed it. Banderas is a gentle poet whose eye wanders at the court of the Caliph. That earns him a new job as ambassador to the Northmen and so off he rides, with his sagely friend ""Melchisadek"" (a few scenes from Omar Sharif). His arrival at their camp is greeted with indifference until a messenger arrives regaling them with horror stories of a terror back home. Their soothsayer advises that thirteen men must return home to combat this evil - but the last of this warlike baker's dozen must not be of their race. Oops - wrong place, wrong time for Antonio and off he sets into an enjoyably paced series of set-piece action scenarios with a Norse theme to them. Luckily, he befriends the charismatic ""Herger"" (an enthusiastic but pretty hopeless Dennis Storhøi) and intrigues the new king ""Buliwyf"" (Vladimir Kulich) with his ability to ""speak sounds"" (write!) and together they gradually bond in the face of their menacing enemy. It's not a great film, no - the dialogue is poor and the acting really isn't up to much ether but there is loads of swordplay, flaming arrows and the whole thing is generally quite light-hearted and good-humoured. This mythology always lends itself well to a good story and the (underplayed) clashes of culture between the rough and ready warriors and their more refined guest adds a little richness to the plot. You won't remember it afterwards, and I bet Banderas probably doesn't want to - but it doesn't hang around and kills an hour and an half easily enough.",7.0,Anonymous,History
I have watched The 13th Warrior over 20 times.,"This is one of the best ""medieval"" movies I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot of them: El Cid, Braveheart, Excalibur, The Hobbit and The Fellowship of the Ring series, Ivanhoe, Adventure of Robin Hood, and the unlisted Prince Valiant. I have watched The 13th Warrior over 20 times.The music is very good, the story is believable: hominid anthropology overlap credible, holds together well, and I have always thought the film's portrayal of Ibn Fahdlan's learning transition, learning Old Norse by listening quietly to the other characters, makes his (our) transition to understanding all of the characters speech quite believable. Good job, there.The battle scenes are great, well constructed, lots of long-shot perspective, avoids cheap close-ups, the cannibalistic bear warriors fierce, the horse riding first rate, and the cave fight scary. As I do not like enclosed spaces, this portion is very believable.While the only notable actor, besides a short cameo by Omar Sharif (Melchisidek), is Antonio Banderas (Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan); I thought the ensemble acting of the others including Dennis Storhøi (Herger) Vladimir Kulich (Buliwyf) were very good. I have yet to see these actors, except Tony Curran, anywhere else.The only complaint I have is the geography. As a geographer, I know full well that Scandinavia can be, for the most part, short on coniferous forests. I deduced that the filming was done, not on location, but in Canada, which I found later to be true. Admittedly, it was probably cheaper to shoot in Canada, and made the story more enjoyable with a few more trees.I am amazed that there are those who've submitted reviews on this site, who rated the abysmal Conan The Barbarian higher the the The 13th Warrior!

Seven Samurai homage?,"Think this is a good movie and little more even, really really decent movie, but very far from a masterpiece or anything like that. And it's also not a big movie with epic sword battles, but function more on a small scale. Almost with bits of fantasy and even horror elements to it. The story is not spectacular imaginative though, and it's not trying very hard to be historically correct. What sells this movie for me is the 12 heroic Viking warriors that are viewed from the eyes of the Arab (Antonio Banderas). Have to mention I thought also this was fun, for Banderas to do a movie like this, that is a bit on the small scale budget wise and with no famous Hollywood actors or even known actors (if you don't recognize Scandinavian actors) and with Vikings as a theme, you wouldn't expect him doing a role like that. Also, one of my all time favorites are Seven Samurai, and I'm sure the script was inspired by Seven Samurai (but I wouldn't know off course), but that is either way usually not a bad thing, just look at the Magnificent Seven for example (I mean the old classic western more then the new one) . Like the 7 Samurai in Seven Samurai the 12 Vikings are fearless, dignified, humorous and with strong sense of brotherhood, loyalty and experience of combat. They create a great dynamic to the movie. The rest of the movie is entertaining, exciting and not too long. To me that's good entertainment. But if you don't like sword fights or Vikings or this time period, perhaps not a movie for you. I like it though. I would recommend.Edit: just checked some more information about this movie. It was diffidently not on the small scale budget wise, it was actually quite expensive, those sets and costumes off course, have to be. Also didn't know that John McTeirnan is the director of Die Hard. I thought this move almost had an indie feel for some reason. I was really really off. Still decent good movie though...",7.0,Anonymous,History
A Horrible Mess,"Not much to say about this movie.  Most of it was fairly incomprehensible. The dialogue was garbled although it would not have helped the plot even if you had understood what was being talked about it.  I was hoping for a guilty pleasure, you know a movie that's not great but that you can still enjoy but definitely no luck with this one.  The scenery was great and Antonio is easy on the eyes. The costumes weren't bad.  Those are the kindest things I can say about it. All in all, I would definitely recommend a pass on this one.",4.0,Anonymous,History
My Absolute Fav,"It's not only my fav, but my Fiancé's fav too. And we hardly have anything in common like that.It's a very authentic film in the fact that it portrays vikings and viking community & culture. The costumes, the sets, the way the characters react to situations.Antonio does a great job as an arab poet forced into adventure by these warriors. He is put off by their brutish and sometimes gross habits but also admires their knowledge of battle, their philosophy, and power. A mutual respect builds as the cultures clash. The vikings slowly begin to understand why they needed a 13th warrior such as Ahmad.The thrilling adventure will keep you on the edge of your seat. Though the enemy of the vikings is on the strange side you will find realistic battles using historical tactics. Not all 13 warriors will return home.Overall this is a great epic film - I don't care about the Criciton gossip over the manuscript and stuff. Don't let it take away from the awe of this movie. To this day I still don't understand why it didn't seem to get enough publicity when it was out in theaters. All I saw was the movie poster but it wasn't enough to convince my Fiancé at the time.

I expected more. Did not age well,"There are not many Viking movies let alone good viking movies, and I had higher hopes for the 13th warrior. The reviews for this movie were overwhelmingly positive, however it's just not a very good movie...Antonia Banderas is totally the wrong person for this role, a Spanish man pretending to be arab... it's not believable.This story would have been better told from the Norse point of view in the beginning, rather than the 13th warrior. It just feels rushed. And the magical ability to understand language was silly.The score feels out of place as well. Ultimately the movie feels like a missed opportunity. But hey its 30 years old so maybe it was better for 1999. Ultimately I found it boring and unbelievable.",6.0,Anonymous,History
13th warrior was a good movie overall,"I'm writing a review for 13th warrior. The actors were very good, they acted hard and tough. The setting was very realistic and matched the movie very well. The clothes they wore were very old fashion and great for this movie. They fit in very well. The dialogue was very good, and you couldn't tell they weren't from that time period. The movie wasn't my taste, but it was still a good movie for people that like those kinds of movies. I would recommend it to friends or somebody that is working of stuff Beowulf. 13th warrior is similar to Beowulf, because there are big monsters destroying both of their villages, and wrecking their lives. This movie represents Grendel and the dragon from Beowulf. The cannibal bear people would kill everybody and then eat them alive just like Grendel. The dragon is represented by warriors descending from the mountain with torches. These interpretations are very unique.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Won't win any Oscars, but worth the $7.50","It's one of Antonio's better films- the characters were well-played, the plot is a bit confusing at times, but over-all, not a bad movie.  I liked the fact Banderas was not the central hero- he was more of the observer. The movie itself wasn't centered around a specific person- it did a great job concentrating on the 13 sent to defend the village.Good if you like blood and an entertaining evening, but not much else.",7.0,Anonymous,History
bad comments about a bad movie,"After walking out of the cinema I thought ""Is the West so insecure about its conquest in all spheres tangible and spiritual, that this insolent little bit of cultural revisionism is required?"" Apparently Michael Crichton feels that way, and needed to bring up some vitriolic bile to spew.Unintentional Comedic Relief elements:I did laugh very hard at the 13th warrior's miraculous ability to pick up Norse faster than Thor's hammer can swing. He ought to replace the Universal Translator in Star Trek, because he'd be better at the job. For that matter, he's also damn good at grinding down claymores into damascene scimitars.On my personal scale, this one rates a -10 for cultural odiousness",1.0,Anonymous,History

A surprising treat...,"I was horribly mislead by my local paper concerning this movie. One of the many critics at the Kansas City Star gave it a terrible review, saying it was boring.

I thought it was an interesting, original adventure of the kind that is rarely made anymore.If I have any problem with the movie, it is that the characters are a tad underdeveloped. We learn more about them through their battle scenes than anywhere else. But I came out not even knowing most of the characters' names (save Antonio's), much less anything else about them. However, a few personalities do manage to shine through the mud and blood.If you're up for a rip-roaring adventure with an interesting story, I highly recommend this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Cow Urine?,"The 13th Warrior is directed by John McTiernan, who also co-adapts the screenplay with William Wisher Junior and Warren Lewis from the Michael Crichton novel Eaters of the Dead. It stars Antonio Banderas, Vladimir Kulich, Dennis Storhøi, Daniel Southern, Neil Maffin, John DeSantis, Diane Venora and Omar Sharif. Music is scored by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Peter Menzies Junior.10th Century Arabian emissary Ahmed ibn Fahdlan (Banderas) joins a band of Viking warriors to do battle with the Wendol, a band of human flesh eaters.A financial disaster for Touchstone Pictures (it lost close to $100 million), The 13th Warrior was beset with problems from the off. Sitting on the shelf for nearly two years before finally getting released into theatres, the version put out was heavily re-edited by producer Michael Crichton; and it shows! Something clearly went wrong in production, where McTiernan, director of two of the finest action movies of the 80s, apparently lost his way. This is if you believe Sharif, who was so upset by the script and direction on the film he proclaimed he was quitting making bad movies; only to then make stuff like Shaka Zulu: The Citadel (2001)! The music department also had its problems, with Graeme Revell having his score rejected and Jerry Goldsmith brought in to, err, put his Wind and the Lion score inauthentically over the top of the film, loudly!Us fans of historical period epics have been fed on scraps in the new millennium, more so for those who have a bent for Viking flavours. The 13th Warrior is not a disaster if you are prepared to just indulge in a thrill ride for an hour and forty minutes. It very much resembles an over extended music video, lots of loud slashing, chopping and thunder with guys dressed up in mud and blood period attire. Evidently this was Crichton's attempt to salvage the movie! Striping away its story and leaving characters and sub-plots resigned to being mini casual observers. It also at times for the dark/night time shots looks murky, Menzies' cinematography barely able to put life into the many action scenes or vividly realise the Canadian locations. Would a new Blu-ray release now improve upon this? Unlikely, though a chance to see McTiernan's original cut would be most welcome...It is a mess of a movie, one that lacks brains and hurts the eyes and the ears, yet it does have its supporters. Lurching from one action scene to the next works for some, they don't care about brains to go with the brawn. But swords and shields film fans deserve better than this personality free tosh. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,History
An Okay ACTION movie. Maybe the novel is better.,"This movie was Ok. It lacked alot though. It lacked, good acting(especially from Antonio Banderas. The first time he spoke in the movie I laughed out loud), balanced action, character development, depth of story and a decent ending. I mean come on. What kind of an ending was that for any action movie. The guy with the horns comes down and dies, just like that. He was never even a threat, a challenge. They just hit him off his horse as if they were playing baseball. And the story itself was too corney. The part where Antonio Banderas learns the Vikings language in one night really didn't make any sence. It was stupid. When you think about it, the story was good, so was the plot, but it just wasn't done right. It's as if it was put together in the last minute by a teenager in highschool I wouldn't be surprised if it was. I haven't read the book, but I've heard it's MUCH better.",7.0,Anonymous,History
The 7 Samurai go North?,"This movie was supposedly taken from a Michael Chrichton book, but it looked to me like a scene-for-scene remake of the Seven Samurai. Even the wooden stockade and tall peaked houses were the same.  The fighters were not so sophisticated, but miraculously there were more of them left at the end, since there were thirteen instead of seven to start with.For a Nordic/Celtic fantasy battle film, it was more convincing than many - not that it made any sense.   It had great looking warriors, costumes, and sets, and some nice touches - learning Norse, the boy messenger.  I could watch more films shot in British Columbia!   I kept getting irritated by the cramped framing, but the general momentum of the picture was fine, with a nice shot of the boat in the fjord at the end.Antonio Banderas doesn't much resemble an Arab, but he is cute as a button, so I'm not complaining, just so no-one tries to persuade me this was a *good* movie.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Great film, I watch it over and over.","I love this film. The main characters' use of a hodge-podge of looted armor from various cultures is a degree of realism you just don't see very often. The story is completely engaging and you are easily drawn into the main character's rite of passage experience. There's a lot of practical wisdom that is conveyed through the dialog that is valuable in itself. I wish more of the battles had been done in broad daylight, but the darkness was part of what the Wendol relied upon to confer a psychological advantage. The thirteen warriors each had their own speciality...it was a well-balanced team. It helped the viewer understand that these were competent and well-seasoned warriors. You can't help but love how the Northmen laughed off tense or dangerous situations...it helped build mutual confidence. There's a lot about respect, honor, and courage in the film that makes it something I don't mind my boys watching (but it is fairly violent, so if you're protective don't let your kids watch it).

Brilliant,"Brilliant movie so many ways but I only mention about my very most favorite facts. You can watch and enjoy the rest of it by yourselves.My favorite parts are Ahmad ibn Fadlan learning Viking language and Buliwyf learns writing the sentence ""There is only one God..."" at one glance - this is key sentence of Islamic teachings. And it's a fact that people in the past are actually learning other languages by observing and listening. Ottoman Emperor Mehmed the Conqueror speak, read and write in 4 languages fluently and are learned all of them by himself with just observing and listening other people.Michael Crichton did a great job digging these facts through the history. Islam used to source of a great culture, Baghdad was a rich paradise in every sense of the word (from material to spiritual) There were poets, scientists, philosophers - peace and abundance. Now there is only oil & gun money and idiots who forgot about being human and killing people with screaming ""Allah Akbar!"" - meanwhile Allah never allows killing innocent people and this emphasized in Quran almost a thousand times. That movie puts a dim light to the glorious past where men live by honor and die by sword - and these men were actually highly intelligent, well educated people with strong leadership qualities. That's I think, I like the movie very very much.",10.0,Anonymous,History

A super expensive sword and sandal epic,"As I was watching this beautifully shot film unfold, I kept wondering how much it cost to make. $160 million!? Seriously? Where was it spent? Antonio Banderas was really hot when this came out, and Omar Sharif doesn't come cheap I'm sure, but really guys?Bad investing decisions aside, the movie's not great. The epic scale of production turns out to be a waste of money as they forgot, in all their spendthrift extravagances, to craft a meaningful story. The characters do not make us believe in their quest, but it's not because of the acting: these European character actors are perfectly cast. There is no meat here, no character arches, no soul drama or connection between the players and the play. My guess is Michael Crichton (who wrote the book this was based off of) had an idea that was a cross between Lord of the Rings, Seven Samurai, and Lou Ferrigno's Hercules, and paid someone a ton of money to film it. As a vapid action epic it's got enough going on to maintain your interest, but just barely and the film is really saved by the last 30 minutes. Rating: 18/40",4.0,Anonymous,History
A highly underrated gem,"I don't understand what people find wrong with this film. First off, it's certainly not in the same genre as Gladiator, Braveheart or The Two Towers. The 13th Warrior is simply entertainment at its best. It's a straightforward, nitty-gritty action film. And those who complain about the first half of the film being boring are completely missing the point of it. This film left a lasting impression in my mind simply because everything was so well-built up from the outset. When Omar Sharif's character translates for Antonio Banderas' character in the Northmen's encampment, it shows how alienated the latter is from these strange men. However, his ability to understand their language shows how talented and adaptable he is- it is a form of fleshing out his character. And the first half of the film really immerses one in the world displayed on screen.As for the latter half of the film, I found it immensely entertaining. I won't forget the man who chooses to be left behind when the Northmen escape the cannibals' lair. There is a lot of fun to be found here, such as a fight between two of the Northmen, one older and one younger, which is a prime example of how quality sound editing can really make or break a one-on-one battle- a flaw that doomed Troy's Achilles-Hector fight scene.I don't understand why people criticize this film's minute details as if it was a historical epic. This is a movie that really takes you away into a different place, and for that it deserves a 9 out of 10.",,Anonymous,History
not a sit down and watch movie,"This movie is an adventure tale involving an Arab who joins 12 Vikings on a sort of ""mythic quest"", to which they believe there will be a logical reason. The characters are not overly believable, but not overly trite, either. The Arab comes across the most believable. They belief in logic, and the modernism of morality doesn't really fit into the middle age world and mentality. You would think they had all read the philosophers and writers of the nineteenth and twentieth century. The movie tries to be a thought provoking piece, a mystery, and an adventure all rolled into one. Where it fails to completely enthrall us is in the super slow pace to which the mystery is even brought up. As a result, it just drones on, without any real interest. It has some nice scenes, and fits in well with modern cinema which is based on having a few ""cinematic"" moments, and a few tough lines. It could be the ""Pulp Fiction"" of the Middle Ages. But it just isn't a film a person can sit down, watch, and enjoy. It neither captivates the spirit of adventure, or the spirit of atmospheric Mystery.

The scenes are full of shadowy forests shrouded in mists which give it a mysterious and magical feel.  It helps add a great backdrop to introduce some superstitions, religious beliefs, and cultures of old.  That is one thing I admire most about the movie.  It shows how accepting warriors were of superstitions even with strong religious beliefs.  However, no matter their fear, they still fight it.Except for that brutal violence and the actors' ability to speak more than one language, it still keeps with the feel of those 80's flicks I love so much.

Braveheart meets the Magnificent Seven,"After reading the novel by Michael Crichton I was surprised to hear that a film of the book was to be made (another Crichton book cash-in!!) given the nature of the story. The result is, however, a very enjoyable film full of epic battle scenes, old-style heroism and plenty of severed arms and flying heads. It's all very spectacular with hordes of heavily armed horsemen crashing through barricades and a suitably thrilling score to back it up - but my biggest problem is that although remaining faithful to the book, it doesn't really add anything, making the story appear a bit aimless and stilted. This is fine for the book, which is more of a diary of events but makes the film appear as more of a series of battle scenes rather than an involving tale. Despite this sentiment, I found the film to be thoroughly enjoyable and would urge anyone wanting a good adventure yarn to check this out. If you want a better viking flick, however, watch the Tony Curtis/Kirk Douglas effort, ""The Vikings"" made in 1958-  its got a better story and is ultimately more rewarding!",6.0,Anonymous,History
I think the Vikings would like it...,"At times, ""13th Warrior"" reminds me of *Beowulf* and at others, ""Erik the Viking,"" but I think that the Vikings themselves would have found it at least a good story if nothing else.I know nothing about Michael Crichton's book, but I'm assuming that Antonio Banderas' character ""Ahmed Ibn Fadhlan"" was actually based on the Arab Ibn Fadhlan, who in the 920s encountered a band of Vikings on the Volga in modern Russia and wrote of his experiences with them, which this film (and I'm assuming Crichton's book) merely dramatizes and adds monsters too. And quite well, imho. Although, it really underplayed that funeral scene when the girl is sacrificed. His description of that recorded for history was much more eye-brow raising than the scene in the movie, if you can believe it. However, the movie's portrayal of his disgust at their hygiene was on par with what is written. I'm also glad that they mentioned that the oracle was called the ""Angel of Death"" which is the same words that Ibn Fadhlan used to describe a similar woman in his writings. The first time I saw this film, I had little interest in Viking culture, however, now I've taken several classes on the subject and am enjoying it immensely. And I've seen the movie at least half a dozen times since then and notice new things each time.Academics aside, I loved the Vikings in this film. So like them! They were down right cuddly! Although like someone else who commented, I had a hard time catching their names. Upon paying *very* close attention, I've figured out who my favorite one was - ""Herger the Joyous"" played by Dennis Storhoi. That would be the one who could speak Greek and challenged that guy who was like a foot taller and 100 lbs heavier to a fight (I also loved the wergeld payment there - I'm a nerd. I know).

"Loki, Smite This!","First I would like to point out the delicious irony of having Spaniard Antonio Banderas playing an Arab in the film.

It's not that this is a bad movie--it's watchable.  Rather the problem is that things get smooshed together and made into a plot with little to no explanation.  How did this Arab ex-poet fall in with Vikings? How was he able to learn their language by listening?  Why didn't he ditch his customary gear for something that would help him fit in?

An tasteful action film with average writing,"By the late 90s, Mr. Antonio Banderas had gained a name for himself. He was a foreign actor until Desperado (1995) and The Mask of Zorro (1998) had thrown him into the limelight. It almost seemed like he wouldn't ever produce a film where people wouldn't flock to go see. But as the saying goes, nothing lasts forever. Sadly, from what is now known, this movie is one of his biggest belly flops in his career. There's good reason to understand why.The story is about an Arab named Ahmed (Banderas) that is banished from his homeland to end up joining a group of Norsemen to fight a common enemy. That's it. The simplest of all plots. Loosely based on the epic poem Beowulf, many of the characters' names resemble the poems' counterparts. So for anyone who has read the story, some may have a better time figuring out what story arc will follow which character. It's an interesting parallel but it isn't special. Possibly one of the worst aspects of the film is the main antagonist. Reason being, there isn't a main antagonist.The common enemy is a tribe or clan of what come off as cannibalistic bear people. They have no rhyme, reason or motive to why they do what they do. The only dialog heard by them is yelling and chanting, that's it. There is a point where the warriors maneuver to kill the root of the clan but it is so weakly established that the it feels rushed to begin with. Also, the pacing is slow which makes it difficult for audiences to really feel like this is an adventure film. This is all understandable since this movie went through several reshoots and having a screenplay written by William Wisher Jr. I can't understand why his works for the last half of 90sdecade is mediocre. In 1991 he wrote for James Cameron's Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991). What happened?There are some good elements though. Antonio Banderas is a big one, although perhaps this is another reason why this movie didn't gather much attention. Antonio Banderas is cast into a film with a bunch of no name actors - is there a possibility of the movie performing well? Slim to none. Anyway, along with Banderas is Vladimir Kulich and Dennis Storhøi who also give the most memorable of performances in this movie. They both have their own charm - Kulich is like the early Chris Hemsworth before Thor (2011) and Storhøi is like a blond Johnny Depp with the same charisma. Those are the only two main characters besides Banderas that stood out to me.Credit should be given to Pat McCorkle for casting these actors though because a lot of Scandinavian actors were picked for these roles. As for action scenes go, when they finally do hit the screen, they are pretty exciting. The carnage and sword fights are always blood pumping which helps make the tense scenes that much more intense. Finally assisting these action scenes is Jerry Goldsmith's score to the film. It is the usual Goldsmith sound but it's still fun. Goldsmith even adds a bit of a middle-eastern theme into the music to cover Mr. Banderas' role. It's an OK watch but the story doesn't carry much water.For action film, the pace is slow and the plot is bone dry. However, the actors do give their characters charm, along with some decent battles and appropriate music.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A greatly balanced action movie,"This movie is a gem of an action flick in my opinion. It has so much more to offer, the plots are not deep, the chars hardly evolve, and still value is added. The narrative beginning does fit perfectly, and let us see how the story began. From the start already we get faced with prejudice: the vicious tartar caravan attackers, the godless fearsome northmen. Even the northmen themselves have judged the Arab and his horse without knowing who he is. It is not hidden well, but some of the Northmen accept him as an equal straight from the beginning. The Story is simple, and still it caught and kept my attention the entire time. The comedy worked as well for me, if not laughing, it still got a smile.Underestimated movie in my opninion, if this was a 100% American cast this would have hit gold in the USA.8/10 for me",8.0,Anonymous,History
Good Action But Misses The (Book)Mark,"Originally written 19 September 1999; moved accountI went to the film prepared to be disappointed. You see, I read ""Eater's of the Dead"" years ago and it remains one of my favorite Crichton books. It is imaginative and masterful. I always wondered why it had never been made into a film as Crichton's other books had. When I saw the production announcement I eagerly awaited news and was disappointed early on with stories that the book had been greatly compromised and they had coped out early with a name change.Hollywood didn't disappoint me. As expected the film was a pale shadow of the book. The entire premise of Neanderthals surviving into the middle ages was completely lost in this silly characterization of some lesser unnamed bad guys.Also conspicuous by its absence was the uninhibited rampant sexuality of the Northmen. The sanitization of this aspect of the book just added to the disappointment.Some of the fight sequences were well done, with some of the better two-handed swordsmanship I have seen on film. Some of the actors portraying the Vikings were surprisingly good too. In that regard I would have to say that the casting was quite good and the single saving grace of the film's effort. They almost made up for some of the other shortfalls, but not quite. This could have been a remarkable film, but Hollywood again chose mediocrity. I would score it a bit above Hollywood's average though for the sets, costumes, swordplay and the great scenery.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Better Than Advertised,"This movie got a great deal of flak from ""professional"" movie reviewers, so I put off seeing it for quite some time.  I found much of the criticism unwarranted.The film is one of the better book adaptations I've seen, and it should be - The Eater of the Dead's author, Michael Crichton, also penned the movie script.  Though the first few sequences seemed rushed, the overall pacing and tone of the film are very effective.  The scenery is lush (it's so nice to see a movie that's filmed primarily on location for a change), the sets remarkable, and the costumes excellent.  Though Antonio Banderas is miscast as Ibin Fahdlan, he does a decent job with the part.  The real stars of the movie, however, are the mighty Norsemen.  Vladimir Kulich, Dennis Storhøi, and the raucous but noble host of others embody every boyhood dream of what Vikings should be.  The only distraction from this party of merry warriors is their various nationalities lead to various accents.  Oh well.  They sure look the part and look as though they're having the times of their lives.The ""monsters"" are effective, but somewhat underwhelming.  The battle scenes, choreographed well by director John McTiernan (Die Hard), are engrossing, and they are the reason I rented the movie in the first place. Enjoy!",6.0,Anonymous,History
Barely worth the effort......,"Let me start by saying that, for my money, few people handle an action movie in quite the way that John McTiernan does....lets face it Predator, Die Hard and Hunt for Red October are right up there with the very best of them. Whilst this recent offering is not nearly as bad as his almost unforgivable Last Action Hero, The 13th Warrior is one that should be watched and discarded without much ado. Suspension of disbelief was difficult to maintain, not least due to the almost laughable range of accents adopted by the principal characters. We'd expect that with Banderas who has, to his credit never attempted to disguise his latin tones, but the ""Northmen"" discuss their business in a dreadful mish-mash of Eastern European, Scottish, Irish and Cockney which, towards the end of the movie, I found increasingly irritating.Michael Crichton's book ""The Eaters of the Dead"" , on which the movie was based, made much more of Ahmed's problems in adjusting to the cultural, religious and philisophical differences between his own race and the Northmen and even allowing for the fact that time and script constraints mean that such subjects cannot be fully explored in the movie, one comes away with a feeling that the entire opening hour of the movie serves no purpose other than to set the scene for the battle. Lastly, I should say that while I'm no fan of Antonio Banderas he does bring a pleasing presence and subtle humour to a movie that, in almost every other way, lacks substance.",4.0,Anonymous,History
I have always felt this was a fairly underrated must see movie,"The 13th Warrior (1999) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Tubi. The storyline follows a noble man who falls in love with the wrong woman and is sent to another kingdom on assignment. On his way he encounters some norsemen who are on adventure. The norsemen get bad news on day of their homeland under siege by legendary creatures from the mountains. They ask the gods for direction and they are directed to send 13 men home to defend their lands and kill the invaders. Unfortunately for the nobleman, he's selected as the 13th warrior to go with the norsemen. This movie is directed by John McTiernan (Die Hard) and stars Antonio Banderas (Desperado), Richard Bremmer (Harry Potter), Tony Curran (Thor), Erick Avari (The Mummy) and Dennis Storhøi (Nobel). The storyline for this has so much depth and twists and turns. The depiction of the two very different types of people is well presented and executed. The lands, settings and backdrops for this movie are so beautiful and captured with wonderful cinematography. The action scenes are excellent - every fight, kill and battle is intense and unpredictable. The monsters and their mystery is well executed and you can't wait to find out what's going on and if they have any hope as an audience. The cast is very well selected and the acting hits the mark. The dialogue is also very good with a nice infusion of humor. Overall I have always felt this was a fairly underrated must see movie. I'd score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Well-worth-the-ride cleaver and unique action-thriller.,"I Finally got to watch this movie as it was just released to video here in Norway. Either I missed it somehow when it was in the theaters it never was released to theaters here. What can I say more than that I LOVED IT!! I thoroughly enjoyed nearly every detail.Without spoiling it for those that haven't seen it yet here's a summary followed by my review and take on it:This is the story of an Arabian diplomat played by Antonio Banderas and his adventure in the land assigned for him to diplomat: ""The North"". Today this would be called Northern Europe, Scandinavia or even more specifically: Norway. ;o)He takes with him his trusted advisor and interpreter, Melkisedek (sp?) to try to communicate with the Norse leaders and assess the situation of their country. In doing so he meets up with a group of Norsemen (Vikings) during a celebration for the coronation of their new king and funeral of their late king.During his stay with these Vikings a young boy from one of the villages of northern Norway comes to seek their help. Several of the neighboring villages had been destroyed by mysterious creatures and king of this boy's village sent him to find some warriors to assist them in defending themselves against these creatures.A fortune teller is summoned to advise them to how they may defeat  the creatures. She says 13 men must travel to the village, the 13th not being a Norseman. Antonio is obviously chosen to be the 13th warrior and they set off together for the quest.It isn't as gory and full of violence as one might expect. I for one was pleasantly surprised by it's tactful balance. They showed enough for you to get the idea that the creatures were cannibals and to sort of frighten you, but they didn't over do it and make it into a ""hack and slash"" horror flick.It was an intelligent thriller that required some thinking. I wondered, ""How in the world are they going to defeat these guys?"" and was mostly satisfied by the answer (which I won't give away now anyway).As one who can objectionably critique this film's accuracy to true Norse lifestyle and legend I must say they did a pretty darn good job!The language spoken by the Vikings was mostly Norwegian. While one of the 12 spoke it with a Danish accent and at least 5 or 6 others had quite strong American accents it was still mostly accurate. The only problem with this is that the true language of the Norsemen/Vikings wasn't really Norwegian as we know and speak it today. It was a very Old Norwegian much more similar (I assume) to Danish while yet very different from both languages. However, giving credit they probably could not have made an accurate imitation of it and if they did it would have been so unintelligible that we couldn't have understood it nor could they have found actors to accurately portray it.The costume detail was terrific! I loved the armor and weaponry used by the Vikings. Their ships were also quite realistic and true to history. One thing I really appreciated was the strange rituals and superstitions of the Vikings. The way they ""buried"" the Viking's leader in the beginning by sending him out in his ship along with his armor and sword and burned it (the ship) is 100% true to legends. In addition they sent a young maiden (likely a virgin) along with him for this ""journey to paradise"" which is also Norse folklore. Also many of their sayings and habits were typical of this culture - especially for back then. Basically I was very impressed with the consistency.What some people may call a lack of plot I call a cleaver and unique story with a historical background without the need for an excessive abundance of plot twists and Hollywood fluff.To my benefit I haven't the incredible book to taint my judgement. There are most certainly many differences and some may be disappointed (they always are) with the result, but frankly I can't see why they complain. This is the MOVIE VERSION!! Get over it!I highly recommend it for anyone that enjoys a good action-thriller with a twist of historical nature. It's almost a combination of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and BRAVEHEART.Long live the VIKINGS!!",7.0,Anonymous,History

John McTiernan's Last Great Flick,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The 13th Warrior"" (1999) was always one of my favorite movies of John McTiernan. Maybe that's because i've seen this movie when i was 15- 16 years old, and i saw it like 5 or 6 times, yes, loved this film at the time.What still strikes me the most is how superbly atmospheric this movie was. Set design was superb, you can clearly see many objects build specifically, and they weren't just cheap sets. Actors were all superb and did a great job for this material, only wished to see late Omar Sharif more on screen. This movie plays like a adventure movie (in the beginning), later it becomes like ""Predator"" and at the some sort of ""Siege"" movie. All genres clicked in here, thus creating this superbly involving and brutal world.Overall, ""The 13th Warrior"" was the last great flick of the great John McTiernan, who's carrier after this movie basically went into oblivion (but not because of this movie). Shame. Having this skill of creating superbly involving, intense and plausible looking entertaining movies, he should definitely would be still very helpful around.

Could have been so much better,"The 13th Warrior is equal parts involving, exciting, but then also weak. The story is formulaic, following a similar pattern to Seven Samurai with an exact number of warriors doing battle against all odds. Throw in some hokum, and pseudo magic/horror and you get the general idea. Where it works, it provides a largely unknown cast to shine, and Banderas does a good job in the lead role. But if the story is formulaic, the script is patchy as though the writer intended to almost ignore characterisation and deal just with the action (which is filmed conventionally and without much drama - and at times it is so dark you have no idea what is happening anyway). It could have been so much better... but then how many times can you say the same thing about recent Hollywood fare?",7.0,Anonymous,History
Major disappointment to say the least,"I have heard some people say that this was an awesome movie, that it had great action, strong acting, good story, etc. Sadly, after watching the movie for the first time, I was severely disappointed on just about every level. Fist of all, there's no plot. At all. As a result, we never what exactly is going on or why. It had something to do with a poet named Ahmed ibn Fadlan, who is banished from his home for looking at the king's wife the wrong way. He then gets recruited by a bunch of viking dudes, who are assigned to find out what(or who) is plundering a certain kingdom. Then the warriors fight the monsters, then rest. Then they fight the monsters again, then rest. Then they fight the monsters again, then rest. Then they fight the monsters one last time, the end. The warriors, aside from having no personalities, have no names. We never learn anything about them. The same goes for Ahmed, other than he is afraid of heights. We are not properly introduced to him or the other characters, as a result it's impossible to care about them. I can't comment on the acting because I couldn't find any. As I said, no one has any personality whatsoever. We don't even learn their names for crying out loud! This might have been forgivable if the much hyped action scenes were any good. Sadly, the action is filmed through a filthy lens and shaky camera work, so you can't tell what is going on at least half the time. More confusing than exciting if you ask me. Bad action, bad dialogue, bad acting, non-existent plot, sloppy writing, lots of pointless scenes, this movie flat-out sucks. Not one of the worst I've seen, but still quite awful.

Instead I was able to appreciate it for what it was as opposed to what it was not.I only have a couple regrets:Why Antonio Bandaras?  Now I like Antonio in general.  He's a good actor and mighty easy to look at, but would it have been so difficult to cast an Arab as Ahmad Ibn Fadlan?

"The 13th Warrior is the best action adventure movie ever, bar none","The story is based on Eaters of the Dead, by Michael Crichton, who intended it as a revisualization of Beowulf. Indeed, I can easily imagine it as an intermediate legend from which Beowulf sprang. (Crichton actually took a hand in directing some of the film.) This is one of the few movies that is much better than the book.The adventure aspect of the film is a lushly photographed north land, an unspecified region of Scandinavia, actually shot in British Columbia. Not the travelogue of many adventure movies, here the weather varies rapidly from brilliant sunshine on verdant forests to gloomy, drenching rain to haunting mist, which becomes a major plot element.For action, imagine an Arabian poet, exiled as Ambassador, having to join a band of warriors led by Buliwyf, i.e., Beowulf, in defending King Hrothgar against a large army of ""Wendol"", the ""eaters of the dead"", which the Northmen fear are demons. (The suggestion from the book that the Wendol might be Neanderthal is never mentioned in the movie except through the casting of the extras that portray them.)What makes this movie riveting is the acting of the ensemble. Antonio Banderas gives one of his best performances as the Arabian poet. Vladimir Kulich makes Buliwyf, i.e., Beowulf, a brooding but powerful leader. And Dennis Storhøi delivers an Oscar-worthy supporting performance as the Northman who befriends the Arab. Throughout the movie, the viewer sees not mere characters, but people, men who depend on one another, who live and fight together with all their bravado and superstitions, fears and faiths. Together the actors enable us to witness the birth of myth.",10.0,Anonymous,History

I drug my boyfriend with me promising that it wasn't just about me salivating over my favorite movie star (at least on the sexy scale). I was so utterly embarrassed in the end.

Separation of main character and protagonist,"You can separate your main character and you protagonist, but it's hard to do well. The 13th Warrior attempts it, but I don't think it's really all that successful. There's a technical polish to the film, especially in isolated sequences, and obvious talent behind the camera, but the story is surprisingly disengaging.The problems are obvious from the beginning with an introduction that hops and skips from Baghdad through a long land journey northwards to Viking territory, an attack on the road, a brief introduction to the Vikings, the introduction of the foreign threat they must face, and the absorption of the main character, Ahmad, into the group as the titular thirteen warrior. It's most jarring when the old crone announces to the surrounding tribe that the thirteenth is foreign (Ahmad being the only foreign man of fighting age there) and then there's a hard cut to him packing up his horse to go along with them. He's never given a moment to question the request or even consider it. He's just automatically part of it.The next major emotional hurdle comes when the group of thirteen warriors makes it across the water to find Hrothgar and his hall. There's no attempt to get to know the villagers cowering in fear of the Wendol terrorizing them. Instead we get some vague palace intrigue that culminates in a fight between one minor character and another person who never rises to the state of character that ultimately makes no difference to the story. Ahmad does get some intimate time with a young, attractive woman of the village, but it couldn't possibly leave an impression because she's in and out with little introduction.The movie works best when the action moves towards the quiet inspection of the clues in pursuit of the Wendol, the mass of bear men that descend on the village, killing as they will and taking the bodies of the slain to eat (this was based on Eaters of the Dead, of course). There's a scene where Ahmad and the other twelve find a ransacked farm, and the camera quietly moves through the farm to follow Ahmad as he walks in and out. It's a quietly effective scene.Action in general is dark but assured, but there's a curious distance to most of it because so few of the thirteen warriors make an impression. There's Ahmad, his friend Herger, and the leader Buliwyf who make a real impression, the rest just feel like background noise, and as the action scenes play out more and more of the background warriors get chopped away, feeling like little is being lost.Now, to talk about the difference between the main character and the protagonist. Ahmad is the main character, but Buliwyf is the protagonist. It's Buliwyf who makes the decisions that drive the gang from one place to the next. It's him who makes the large strategic decisions. It's him that the final battle ends up revolving around emotionally, and yet, we don't really follow him. We're with Ahmad all the way, playing as follower to those around him. That moment early when he suddenly joins the other twelve is a prime example. He exhibits no agency on his own. The rest of the twelve affirm their desires to go on the journey, but Ahmad just appears in line. His efforts to fit in range from rather ingenious (John McTiernan has a thing for intelligently demonstrating the transition of languages) to amusing, but the amusing bits aren't what drives the film, they end up feeling like distractions.A final note: There are serious questions about the film's authorship. By everything I've read, John McTiernan, the director, and Michael Crichton, the writer/producer, clashed extensively on set. After a disastrous test screening, McTiernan did not come back to the project (apparently off working on The Thomas Crown Affair that ended up releasing before The 13th Warrior), instead Crichton directed the rather extensive reshoots. So, who's film is this? McTiernan is listed as director, but it's an obviously compromised production with two authorial hands at play.I'm rather mixed on this film. From a purely technical perspective, there's a good bit worthwhile, but there's also a problem in terms of emotional disconnect based on some narrative choices that don't really work. The adaptation of Eaters of the Dead (which is, in turn, a rather clever take on Beowulf) could have been more engaging and entertaining than it is. It's far from a disaster, but also far from a success.",5.0,Anonymous,History
1999's biggest could-have-been,"When I first saw this movie, I was both excited and disappointed. I had loved Crichton's novel and was hoping for a lot, but sadly, all was not achieved.  The 13th Warrior was supposed to have been an epic somewhere along the lines of Braveheart, but the editors chopped the movie up so badly, it turned out to be nothing more than a medieval hack-a-thon. Really a shame considering its potential.  The movie was extremely well cast (all the Vikings were really cool), cinematography was great, and music was good, though often underused.  However, the script was terrible, and the overall storyline was far too basic.  This killed any feeling of depth, both in the characters and the plot.  Bad direction?  Not likely, considering John McTiernan's experience and all that the book gave him to work with.  There was a big delay in the production and release of the film and I would guess there was big controversy over what kind of movie McTiernan was trying to make.  Too bad some better thinking wasn't put into it, because it could have vied for film of year if it had been done right.  Still, The 13th Warrior was an enjoyable movie and I would recommend it if you like ""historical films"".",6.0,Anonymous,History
A little background needed to enjoy the film,"I see a lot of comments asking why much of what is happening is happening. I think the 13th warrior is not for mass public viewing for one reason. The public is illiterate.  This is a wonderful adaptation of Beowulf, with much Norse mythology thrown in.  With this background it would be impossible for me NOT to like it.  I thought it was a very good movie.  I can, however, see where someone coming to see the movie and expecting an ""Armageddon"" could be disappointed.  The story isn't developed the best because it has been around longer than any written story in Europe or the Americas.  It's a well known story (or at least it should be) and so the need to spell out every little detail seems extraneous.The characters ARE quite well developed and I saw in Buliwyf (sounds a bit like Beowulf doesn't it?) the quintessential Viking warrior/king.  As for the inclusion of the Arab, this was just Crichton's clever way of explaining how the story got out.  The movie felt a need to have a dynamic character and so Banderas was it.  Its hard for a Viking to have a change of heart when they are by nature and belief so resigned to fate.  This came across very well through the characters, and for anyone to claim that the Viking translator was un-engaging is bobby-cock.  He was incredibly entertaining and likeable.Another claim I have heard made is that the ship was too small to carry all those men.  My goodness, do your homework before making such a claim. These ships were used and used in just the way portrayed.  Cross seas travel was a marvel of the Scandinavian age and these ships were the pinnacle of sea travel until the caravel.Overall a great movie, but not everyone will enjoy it, especially the unambitious cynic.  Read Beowulf and a little Norse mythos and this movie is for you.  If you'd rather not, then don't bother, you probably won't get what's going on.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Adventure, well acted, and a touch of history.","Very underrated film. A good adventure made better being based on the actual diary of the main character. The film shows the culture contrasts between the relatively educated and civilized Arab world in that time and the very primitive superstitions of the Northmen. Of course there limits to its accuracy, but it was well acted and entertaining as well. It pushed me to read the book on which it was based. The screen adaptation was different from the book, slightly more restrained on the coarser elements of the narrative, but it retained, even enhanced, the feeling for that period and locale in history. Antonio Bandaras made a creditable Arab adventurer and Omar Sharrif was an elegant mentor for the younger man. The Viking warriors were wonderfully played by a myriad of hardy men of various nationalities. I could not help wondering where the adventure took place - where the viking settlement was. The location shooting was believable as some northern 'viking' settled land - perhaps on the Baltic. The 'manly' humor was well done.",9.0,Anonymous,History

It will enrich your appreciation of the movie, and it just might help you figure out what's going on behind the scenes and to understand the characters a bit better.Certain scenes toward the end of the film make the whole worthwhile, and Bandaras does a great job without having to be the toughest man on the screen all the time.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A Dreadful Film,"This has probably got to be the worst medieval sword flinging movie I have ever seen.

For example the heir apparent who supposedly fears the 13 warriors wants to take over his father land. What happened to him!!!It also seems to be an over glorification of Islam and not particularly historically correct. The Arabs were far more advanced than the Vikings, however this potrayal was poor.Basically I can't believe such a rubbishy film is financed by Hollywood. It makes you wonder about whether the production crew even went to film school.  It probably should have gone straight to video. The only thing i thought that was Ok was the casting of the fearless King and the respect his men had for him towards the end of the film. He looks a little though like Val Kilmer.Don't waste your money on it at the Box Office. Save it for a rainy day when it comes out on Video",2.0,Anonymous,History
Lucky for some.,"Another film that jumped into my list with the arrival of Disney Plus' ""star"" channel. ""The 13th Warrior"" is a film that though starting to show it's age a bit, was reasonably entertaining despite it's troubled production.Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan (Antonio Banderas) is an envoy of the Byzantine empire, sent North by his King. He falls in with a group of Viking warriors, led by Buliwyf (Vladimir Kulich). Buliwyf and his men are requested to head home, to defend a village from a supernatural enemy but before they leave their seer tells them they must be 13 Warriors in order to succeed and that Ahmed must be part of their group. They bond over travel and as language barriers are overcome, but they are not prepared for the threat they will face.Based on Michael Crichton's novel, which apparently is loosely based on Beowulf, the test screenings were apparently so bad that reshoots were ordered and Crichton himself was allowed to make changes. The only place I feel you can really experience that is in the ending, which I felt was rather anticlimactical, so who knows how bad McTiernan's ending must have been. Up until that point, I thought the film was pretty solid. The battle scenes were fine and somewhat gory, the reveal of the story and what the Northmen were actually up against was well done. There are some subplots that I supposed were hangovers from the original version, which revolve around the leadership of the kingdom going forward and the present King's son, who just disappears once he suffers a setback, I assumed he was going to betray his village somehow, but he just leaves.I liked Banderas and in particular his relationship with Herger, played by Dennis Storhoi. I also enjoyed seeing Tony Curran and Clive Russell as two more of the Viking 13. It's the sort of action set piece film that appears now to have been totally relegated to ""straight to DVD"" hell as producing them has become cheaper over the years but up until it's underwhelming ending, it's alright.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"This movie ranks, and I mean RANKS, at the bottom","How could a film which supposedly cost $100 million and has a similar theme to Game of Thrones, be so totally boring and just awful to sit through. Even my cat was pawing at the door to be let out. If Ed Wood had been listed as producer/director/writer I would have known what to expect. To begin with, the special effects seemed more like a low budget TV movie, and the film looked as if it had been shot with a home video camera or 16 mm film. Where did the money go?Antonio Banderas cannot act, he just stands around while we get shots of his big brown eyes, but at least they did not try to pass him off as a Viking Warrior, for which I will give the film a rating of 1. Even Kirk Douglas and Tony Curtis did a better job as Vikings, although they were Jewish.THIS-TV showed a low budget film this week called Royal Deceit, (Prince of Jutland) a telling of the Viking saga on which Shakespeare's Hamlet was based, and which showed how absorbing a budget film could be.The footage should be given to film students to practice with and see if someone can come up with an understandable, interesting, and more enjoyable film.",1.0,Anonymous,History

A fun and actionpacked viking adventure!,"The 13th Warrior is based on the Michael Crichton novel Eaters of the Dead and is the story of Ahmad ibn Fadlan (played by Antonio Banderas), an Arabian poet and diplomat who is chosen as the thirteenth of a band of viking warriors who must travel to the North to free a kingdom of an evil force. The movie is a mix between the historical account of Ahmad ibn Fadlan and his meeting with the vikings and a much bigger portion of the story is a kind of retelling of the Anglo-Saxon epic poem Beowulf. I liked it a lot because of the acting, the cinematography and the action. Though I am not too sure about the casting of Antonio Banderas (my guess is that he was popular at the time) I had a great time in general.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"far better than it's given credit for, with some excellent performances","Although I agree that this movie is really well shot, its abiding problem is its lack of light. So much of the action takes place in caves or tents or in the dark that it becomes enormously oppressive. It's a huge relief when the last battle takes place in broad daylight. It's such a pity that the desire for a bleak, claustrophobic northern atmosphere was allowed to compromise the story telling, as this version of the Beowulf tale has much to offer. Dennis Storhoi and Vladimir Kulich are outstanding, but many of the other warriors give performances of great credit in lesser roles. Antonio Banderas is very fine as a fop finding his manhood through exposure to the vikings' positive, almost cheerful fatalism",8.0,Anonymous,History

13 Warriors movie full of suspense and adventure!

I am not telling you what it is. It has so many great actors in it, Antonio Banderas, and Omar Shariff and others that I had seen in other movies. It is a bit like Braveheart in that it shows the hard life these people lived, but also how they were such robust and courageous men who were Not Afraid of Anyone or thing. It was really an awesome movie. I did like how tough the men were and strong, and never backing down. It portrays Vikings as men that one did not trifle with. They just were bigger then life in this movie. It was full of suspense, and adventure, and it was scary in parts, and I was on the edge of my seat many times, wondering if they would make it through.

Antonino Banderas non-violent? Be still my heart!,"A group of twelve gruntin', scratchin', wandering Vikings is called back to its home by a child oracle to fight a deadly band of attackers. The oracle states, however, that there should also be a 13th warrior, one who is not from the north country. Enter Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan (Antonio Banderas), an Arab who's just passing through and is already disgusted by the slovenly habits of the Vikings. So off goes the troupe. They're attacked a few times along the way, in the middle of the night as the fog rolls in (eerie!), and are stunned to find no casualties of their attackers, even though several were killed during each skirmish. Hmm! Turns out these are flesh-eaters, always part of myth but never seen even in those times. You know, one of those stories that's been handed down from generation to generation, but it's been so long since anyone who witnessed the stories firsthand was alive that the tales are more fiction than fact.Well, now our boys know what they're up against, but it takes them the entire movie to really get things going. For once, Banderas is not the hero, not the swashbuckler of ""The Mask of Zorro"" or the gunslinger of ""Desperado."" The Vikings are the tough guys, and at first they patronize the outsider who doesn't speak their language. But soon he does, and soon he's one of the gang. Here's to male bonding!The plusses of this movie are its cinematography and atmosphere (even my TV set smelled a little murky) and solid action performances by a fine (and international) cast. Downside: there ARE some subtitles, especially at the beginning when the Vikings speak Nordic and Banderas stands, uncomprehending. I guess it's for his benefit as much as for our benefit that those subtitles are there, because he eventually learns the language simply by listening to them. So if you can take a grunting, scratching, me-big-male, chest-thumping movie, watch this.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Their enemy? A foreign army of men akin to Native Americans. Who they were fighting for? I don't know. Between the interspersed foreign languages and the thick accents I couldn't gather anyone's name or their cause. It was all very confusing.

Outstanding adventure thriller,"I really love this film. What a great combination of mystery, thrills, chills, and blood-soaked battles.I understand some people having a problem with Antonio Banderas playing an Arab. He's a Spaniard - so he looks and sounds like a Spaniard. But I really think he gives a great performance here. He really makes his transformation from pampered Lothario to warrior compelling and believable. He has this great intensity that takes the action to a whole other level. The largely unknown supporting cast is also great. They feel totally authentic.Without a doubt this is one of John McTiernan's best films. He was really on a role in the late 90's - which makes you wonder just what went wrong with Rollerball and Basic. Hopefully he'll return to form - cause few directors can move the camera as well as he can.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"Too compressed, but wonderfully Norse.","The movie's main fault is, perhaps, that it's not as good as it could be. However, it's not actually a bad movie.Based on Michael Crichton's novel adaption of the Beowulf legend, it certainly suffers from a relatively short running time of 100 minutes - it tries to work in the political subplots, plus some lengthy journeying/cultural acclimation sections at the beginning that just feel rushed.Where it most succeeds is the atmosphere. From the time the 13 warriors reach the North, the film becomes steeped in the Norse worldview. Fatalism and superstition abound - things that could be explained rationally in the light of day become sinister, mystical portents in the dense, rapidly-falling fog. This feel is aided by a strong (mostly) Scandinavian cast, excellent sets and good costuming.Unfortunately, Crichton's clever premise -- that this might be the way Beowulf's story really happened, before time and the endless re-tellings spun it into legend -- is mostly lost, and I think a lot of people thought the script-writers just roughly copied ""Beowulf"" because they couldn't come up with their own story.There is a good movie hiding in here, but as it stands it's only a decent sword flick, though it provides a good Nordic fix, if you find yourself needing one.

"Take historical manuscript, mix with famous myth, stir","Awesome!  Totally awesome!  One of the most exhilarating movies I've ever seen!  Far better than any of the so-called blockbusters that crashed down upon us earlier this summer.  This was one cool film, and from one of my favorite books (usually when a book I love gets filmed, I want to puke).Crichton takes the manuscript of Ibn Fadhlan (one of the most important documents in history, an eyewitness account of Vikings by an Arab diplomat who was kidnapped by them while on a mission to the Bulgars--from which anthropologists got the eyewitness account of a Viking funeral) and combines it with the story of Beowulf, changed a bit to make the monsters into men. Parts of the book has been changed to make them more visual for the film, but the result is an amazing array of images masterfully woven into a rich tapestry of 10th Century heroism.  Okay, the armor sucks--there's no reason to put Buliwyf/Beowulf into gothic plate other then to give the film a Boris Valejo flare.  Other then that, however, it is truly stunning.  There is a sense here both of the barbarism of the Vikings as Ibn Fadhlan first encounters them, and the heroism and spirit he finds as he gets to know them and, eventually, becomes one of them.  Brilliant.  Absolutely brilliant!",10.0,Anonymous,History

Overall a decided Yawn.,"I went into the theater expecting an extremely violent movie, which I received, But it had no PLOT! For blood and guts I would rate this movie highly, but from a story point of view, it is very lacking. Also, the time frame wasn't really an issue. Even though it may have only been a few scenes in the movie, the point where he learns the Norse language must have been AT LEAST two to three months! Which is even more surprising, as he(Ibn) didnt have his interpreter with him, and apparently could only speak arabic! Coupled with the extreme differeces in grammar and syntax, this is highly unlikely.I have very many Gripes about this film, but everyone else has already highlighted them, good on you.

"A good movie, damaged by a mediocre script","This movie is a bit contradictory to me. It's a movie worth seeing if we just want pure entertainment, but it does not have enough quality for us to think of it as a really good movie. The action centers on the participation of an Arab ambassador in a Nordic military expedition, sent to protect an isolated village that was being attacked by some sort of evil creature. And the weaknesses of the plot begin to appear before us: what would motivate an Arab sultan to want to maintain diplomatic ties with the tribal peoples of Northern Europe? They could never help in case of war because they are too far away, and commercial relations were impracticable at that time because of the enormous distance between them. It seems the idea did not come from the script, but from a novel in which the film is based, but it does not matter. It's still hard to swallow. Another point that drew my attention in the negative is the portrayal of the Norse as an illiterate people who needed an Arab to write their own story. The writer certainly forgot that the Norse are the inventors of a particularly well known writing system, the runic alphabet. Even for an age where teaching was rare, it is believable that Beowulf, as a prince, had at least some notions about this writing system, thus not needing a foreigner to ""draw sounds"" for him.The strong point of the film is the combat scenes. They were thought out in detail and deserved the attention of the technical team. The idea of ​​""bearsmen"" is also good, but it is difficult for me to believe that the Norse, warlike as they prove to be, believed in that story of the creature of fire. There is a huge contradiction latent in that: if the Norse are bellicose and bragging, why would they flee from an army with torches thinking it is a hellish serpent? In the first attack it is quite evident that they are men, not frightening creatures out of our worst nightmares. There's no sense in really believing that.António Banderas is literally the man of the movie. He appears, he shines, he makes a good participation. Omar Shariff also deserves an honorable mention for his fleeting appearance. He's an old-timer, with excellent diction and he is perfectly at ease in the role. The sets and costumes are good, they make the audience feel truly Northern Europe and the Viking environment. It's a shame that the script has not been reviewed and improved, as this would have made this film substantially more positive.",4.0,Anonymous,History

You truly identify with the ""fish-out-of-water"" Bandaris character and get engrossed in the story (based on Criten's Eaters of the Dead, which gives away the major plot twist and was logically changed).

In the movie I especially liked the part when he realizes he is a warrior and defeats the evil people murdering in Hrothgar's kingdom. I think the setting of the story was really interesting, how the people back then acted; they had very poor hygiene, and I thought it was really surprising that they would settle disputes by fighting with weapons. The actor's clothing and dialog I thought to be very authentic, because when I think back to that time how the actors looked and dressed is very similar to what I picture in my mind.

Solid Adventure with the Crichton Touch,"The end of the last century was a great time because Michael Crichton was still with us. His touch is clearly in evidence in this film.I just finished watching it again for about the twelfth time, and I still find nuances in dialogue, acting performances and story structure that are a delight. For example, the way we see our protagonist learns his fellow warriors language is wonderfully shown.I see only three challenges that Crichton was unable to fix:1. As noted, the origin of the enemy is never really explained. Why are they hostile, and how are they different from the men they fight? I know the book provides an explanation, but I think it could've been included somewhere in the storyline.2. An ensemble cast of this many characters (13 warriors, after all) requires careful staging to ensure we can follow the fates of all of them, so we understand who falls when, and who is left to carry on. Some of the characters never develop well enough, or look so much alike that it becomes hard to know who is who in fight scenes and discussions afterwards. It can be done, and ""The Dirty Dozen"" is an excellent example of how to do it.3. Finally, the main night attack on the town has some thrilling moments, but the lighting is such that it can be hard to follow which of the characters is facing off against the foe, and the final set of scenes is a confusing mishmash of horses, torches and repeated shouting of the same warning.Nevertheless, these are minor shortcomings.I will watch it again--for the 13th time--Odin willing.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"Some good grimy & gory action but mostly the film is uninvolving with no characters, a weak plot and poor dialogue throughout","In 922 AD, Arab courier Ahmed is in the Nordic area of the world when a call goes out for thirteen warriors to come forward and help defend a town in the far North that has found itself under attack from a terrible form of evil. When it is announced that the gods have indicated that the 13th warrior of the group must not be a man from the north, Ahmed finds himself volunteered.Quickly he learns their language on the journey and he arrives to find himself in a battle against a species of bear-like demons who kill and eat their victims.I can only assume that the R rating really hurt this film as it came to the UK with no so much a fanfare as a whimper. The adverts were there more or less but the audience was not. I'm not sure if the reshooting helped or hindered this film as I have not seen or heard anything about what they redid or why they did it but I found this final product to be hardly spectacular but certainly an enjoyable enough swords & battles film. Based on a book by Michael Crichton, it was a surprise to me just how weak the script was (I have not read the book) although I could see enough plot to interest me if it had been written without so much clunky dialogue and maybe just given me even one character that I could get to know. Instead the scripts just seems to be trying to get to the next action scene and even makes the mistake of trying to inject a form of modern humour to the proceedings  failing in a quite unfunny manner.However what it does do pretty well is deliver battle sequences and solid bloody action even if they a little grimy and unshowy when you put them beside, say, Gladiator. However they are still enjoyable and the whole man/bear thing works a lot better than I expected it to; if only the script had been better then the action would have been more involving and therefore more exciting  as it was I found it to be enjoyable and bloody but I was barely engaged once. With such weak characters and dialogue to work with the cast are left just to try and look heroic and windswept  which is more or less all they manage to do. Banderas is quite a good presence but the rest of the cast are a mix of accents are really only serve to fill out the background without making much of an impact.Overall I can see why this film failed to capture an audience because it isn't any great shakes. The script is where the problems lie as it delivers mostly clunky dialogue without any feeling and manages to produce almost no characters that make an impression. The action is grimy and gory fun but without any involvement in the story I was left watching as opposed to being really into it. A watchable period action movie but no more than that and one that will fade from my memory pretty quickly I'm afraid.",,Anonymous,History

Very bad indeed!!I will now sum up the things that are impossible or leave a questionmark in my head.How can an Arab possibly meet Normen in the desert? The larger part of the movie is set in Scandinavia. How come there are africans among the cannibals? How come that not all cannibals are african, but some also have the Scandinavian look? Why is the leading part for Antonio Banderas and is the heroic part in the final scene for a minor character? Why is the romance between Antonio and this girl worked out so poor? Why are there so many small scenes in the movie, where they never get back to?I am sure I still forgot some questions, but at this very moment I can't recall them.To conclude I want to state that after when I saw the movie, my first impression was: ""Cool!""Than I went to the bathroom and started thinking...When I came back and thought over about how to comment for IMDB, my conclusion was that this movie was actually very poor, and only to be recommended to real lovers of the medieval genre.Regards, Johan Romeijn",7.0,Anonymous,History
abysmal... and I don't mean the cave!,"The gore was ok, though. To me it all looked a bit like a live-roleplay session with first-choice equipment and the usual improvised plot:<approaching the village> GM: You now come to a very rural village in the middle of nowhere. Player: Do we notice anything special? GM: Yes, there are no fortifications and no fighting men to be seen.<players reluctant to eat the bait to get on with the plot> Village king: Oh, by the way we lost Thorvaldtstaett two years ago and demons burnt Smoerebroet last year. Player: I don't believe that crap. Village king: But we got an eye witness here. Enter the eye witness who starts his lament.<GM: Curses, I overdid the attackers' number, they slaughter the party> Player: This is the end we are about to die here! GM: Errrmm, you hear a distant horn signal and the attackers withdraw. Player: Wow, this was a close one. GM grins...Then, where does the Arab fit in, THE 13th warrior? Apart from fooling around with the sword before reforging it to proper Arabian shape, becoming sick on the boat and puking into the forest there is nothing special about the character or his part in the plot. Maybe, to get another couple of shots in without bleeding the thin plot before time?Agreed, the movie got its moments which in the end makes it  all-in-all the more frustrating. The idea of the supernatural enemy is nice and works really good until they come down the mountain in numbers. The ""kill the brain to get rid of the body""-solution, in the way it was provided, only produces a feeling of nauseous deja-vu in the state-of-the-art movie-addict. No, I prefer to have a go at 7 Samurai for the 13th time instead.My advice: Do not go to your local cinema unless a toothless old hag throws some carved bones at you.",2.0,Anonymous,History
I can't really find a flaw,"I'm watching this movie right now, and I remember seeing it in the theatre years ago. Its such a good movie, the characters are so well cast and the look and feel is so genuine. This is one of those movies that bad word of mouth prior to its actual release really affected the box office. The critics got it wrong unfortunately and I often wonder if it was due to wanting to knock Michael Crichton down a peg rather than their actual view of the film. The suspense is real, the enemy scary, and the peril palpable. Its a guys movie to be sure, even in the movie the female roles are subservient, so I wouldn't choose it for movie night. But on a rainy afternoon with nothing to do, put it on and you will find it entertaining to be sure.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Good movie but....,"This was good movie.  The acting was good by all.  The trailer, though; kind of made the movie out to be a little on the super natural side (which is one of my favorite genres) which it turned out not to be.

Avoid this warrior like the plague!,"Well, I've got to hand it to director John McTiernan: either he has incredibly high hopes for this film or he underwent a brain transplant from aliens from the planet Moronis.  Apparently he thought a film with the name ""Eaters of the Dead"" wasn't vague enough, and by changing it to a name that has next to nothing with the actual story (more on that later)....well, you get the picture.The ""script"", based upon the novel by Michael Crichton, is thoroughly awful, which is even worse, given what potential it had.  Perhaps it wasn't the script that needed work, but we'll never know when we've got an actor such as Antonio Banderas reading them in a drab, monotonic voice that only he can do.  For instance, one of the subplots that was only mentioned but never explained was Ahmed's ""prophecy"" to kill the bear-people.  Yeah!  Speaking of ""profits"", I wonder if this movie made any?The only two redeming features that this film has is that it pumped some desperately-needed funds into the Canadian film industry (The bulk of the work was shot in Vancouver Island), and occasionally, the cinematography stands out (esp. the scene where Ahmid ""learns"" the viking's language, and replies to their insults with the retort that is sure to stand out in film history:  ""My mother... was pure woman from a noble family!  But at least I know who my father was, you pig-eating son of a w***e!"")That line bumps my vote from a 1 to a 2.",2.0,Anonymous,History

This stinks!!!!,"I watched the 13th warrior last night and it was really one of the worst movies I ever seen. I could not really get a grip of the time in history. They where using armour from the 15th century in one second and in the next they were attacking cavemen that existed 25000 years ago. Lets say that the story took place just before the age of the vikings ended, about 900 A.C. The amount of people that lived in the viking village were actually believable. On the other hand where did the huge army of cavemen come from??? And where did they get all their horses??? In that time I don`t think you could find that many horses in all of Europe. Why had not the village people met the cavemen before??? They must have lived as close as 2-3 miles from each other. The cavemen lived in the cave close to the sea. The vikings could hear the sea from the village.Strimm, Sweden",1.0,Anonymous,History
A qualified success,"I have two nice things to say.  Possibly more.(1)  I loved every minute of the Norse atmospherics.  We really get a sense of ... well, everything we're meant to get a sense of: damp greenness, a village barely clinging on to existence on the very edge of the civilised world, pure cold wilderness on every side, clear air, rustic grandeur, and an immense amount of wood.  Location shooting is rarely this good.  I gather we're looking at Canada rather than Scandinavia, but (a) who cares, it's the result that counts, and (b) it's obvious that a lot of work, and thought, and of course wood, went into the creation of the village: it might as well be the real thing.(2)  Only once or twice have I seen sheer physical courage so convincingly portrayed.  It's clear that each Viking is willing to risk his life - or, even more impressively, extreme pain - without hesitating for a moment, and without fear making a difference one way or the other; and this comes across as genuine bravery, rather than cartoon heroics.  It's not easy to make characters so remarkably brave without giving the impression that the laws of human motivation have been suspended, and that therefore they're not brave at all.  ""The Thirteenth Warrior"" certainly succeeds.(1) and (2) are reason enough to see the movie, and to prevent it, whatever flaws it may have, from being bad.  The story isn't bad, either.  (The most that can be said against it is that it's simple and unremarkable.)  Yet the film as a whole is less than a complete success.  I'm not sure why.  Others criticise the editing, and indeed it is a bit over-chopped, but much less so than, say, ""Gladiator"".  Maybe we don't get enough of a look at any one character.  The Arab would be an obvious one to sketch in greater detail.  I think the soft-focus, soft-light look of the opening scenes was a fairly serious mistake.  Remember, the story is told from the Arab's point of view; and Arabia is, so far as he is concerned, the MOST solid and detailed and real place in the universe.  It simply doesn't make sense to show us his homeland through a dreamlike haze.And I feel another serious mistake has been made in depicting the evil that threatens the Northern village.  When we find out more about it, it becomes far too science-fictiony; the wonderful flavour is lost.  This, rather than poor editing or under-characterisation, is what makes the conclusion less than satisfying.Still, this matters less than you might suppose, in the face of (1) and (2).",8.0,Anonymous,History
Good One,"Everyone who expects depth of character took the wrong turn in watching The 13th Warrior ;) What we get is a little adventure flick with some really funny moments (clash of cultures) and some good old sword fighting action.

The 13th Warrior - no movie to rank between the best in movie Valhalla but good enough to ""kill"" some spare time with fun in these peculiar times.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Long + Boring + Silly Writing < Good Action Film,"It never ceases to amaze me that a studio can spend $100 mil on a movie, and seemingly forget to pay somebody to write a decent screenplay. In this case, the writers seem to have spent their time trying to figure out how to write around some awkward constructs that didn't make much sense in the first place. For example, when the director tires of hearing all this foreign language stuff, he needs the main character to start speaking their language. Solution: the main character learns this foreign language, apparently perfectly, in one night, by `listening'. Say what you will about the `universal translator' in Star Trek, at least it avoids this kind of stupidity.Unfortunately, holes abound throughout the story. At several points, effort is made to show the viewer that the mythical aspects of the enemy are just that, mythical, and we get to see the trick, i.e. the scary bear teeth is just a mask, the glow worm is actually cavalry with torches, and so on. But all of this is undone at a stroke when all of the dead bad guys disappear like a wisp of smoke.I like both epic stories based on historical facts and fantasies based on myth, but please, it shouldn't be that hard to keep some semblance of consistency.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Missing the point,"Most of the reviews I've read here miss the point of the story. ""The 13th Warrior"" is a movie adaptation of Michael Crichton's ""Eaters of the Dead,"" which is a retelling of BEOWULF, for heaven's sake. Crichton's approach was to assume that the Anglo-Saxon poem was a fancied-up version of an Arab traveler's history. So you have Beowulf as it might really have happened, etc. etc.The Wendol are Neanderthals surviving in colder climes into historic times. They stand in for the ogre Grendel, and the Wendol mother is Grendel's dam. The idol is a recreation of an actual prehistoric mother-goddess talisman. The Fire Worm is an attack by the Wendol bearing torches. It stands in for the dragon that kills Beowulf in the poem. But, hey, other than the Arab, it's all there -- the underwater cave, the coast guard who challenges Beowulf's ship on arrival, the antlers atop the great hall named Heorot, the insults bandied back and forth between the hero and the snarky champion in the hall, etc.The movie is a solid 'B'-type movie. A bit hokey, but well-played by all -- it's a nice way to blow an evening. Seen as a direct screen adaptation of Beowulf, it's too over-the-top, but as an adaption of Crichton's novel, it's pretty good.",,Anonymous,History
"Entertaining for some, cliche medieval saga for others","Well I actually did not know about the background of the movie before i went to see it other than it was based on a Micheal Crichton book. As soon as the movie had started, I realized that i had previously read the book, Eaters Of The Dead, which it was based on. That said, i watched the movie knowing the general plotline of the story. Crichton himself took the story from the Beowulf saga, much of which i have actually gone over in the old english. If you have studied any old english, you've probably heard of the story as some of the earliest manuscripts written in English are the tales of Beowulf. It's an interesting saga, and if that's your thing, you might find it interesting to check out.In any case, the movie itself came across as your typical medieval saga. The characters were not as interesting as i would have hoped. There are items thrown in that play no role, such as an apparent love interest that never develops. In general i can say that this is not the best film and won't be on anyone's oscar lists, well, maybe for costumes. That said, I still enjoyed the movie. It was fun for me, but i think more because i knew the background and i've always had some kind of interest in these big sagas, even though they never live up to expectations. I recommend reading the book, Eaters of the Dead, and maybe checking out the beowulf saga a little.

Good bloody fun,"This blend of historical adventure and horror maybe somewhat incoherent at times, but it's hard not to be caught up in this tale of an Arabian nobleman recruited to be 'The 13th Warrior' by a band of Norsemen who have been called on to defend a village from apparently supernatural flesh-eating creatures.Antonio Banderas is effective as our audience identification figure, a cultured civilized poet, in a fish-out-of-water scenario with the uncouth Norse folk he's with.The battle scenes are impressive, with Antonio and co taking on the monstrous marauders. Jerry Goldsmith's score is one of it's key strengths, providing the epic feel the film needs.Where it falls apart somewhat is the introduction of characters and subplots that prove to be totally irrelevant, and pointless, and seems merely a way to pad things out a bit.Still, it's a definite must-see for blokes.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Kudos to McTiernan et. al.,"This movie was extremely well done... great cinematography, excellent casting, well written script, plenty of action, fantastic battle scenes, and one hell of a plot.

My favorite action scene was the first night's battle in the Great Hall... The scariest part was the ""Fire Wurm"" coming down the hill... Talk about grabbing your balls and wanting to run and hide!  Anyone searching for a great period piece, or just some testosterone pumping battle sequences needs to see this movie.  It's too bad that it was abandoned by the studio just before release, with almost no advertising, little distribution and an exceptionally poor release date.. it could've been a moneymaker, I wonder why they dropped it like a hot potato? One of Banderas' best roles, but not hyped the way it should've been.  Oh well, Hollywood. Go figure.

Although this is not explained in 13th Warrior. The film also borrows from Akira Kurosawa's samurai movies, but the discipline of those movies barely makes it to the 13th Warrior.Overall, it is a film of parts that have not been integrated into a whole.

I don't remember too much from it,"I only remember bits and pieces of this movie, which I saw in theatres back when it was out.

Anyhow, I remember that it has some connection to Beowulf which I find pretty boring as well. I saw this movie the night before I went away to college for the first time. So I guess it's a tad nostalgic. But I don't think the movie was very good really. Antonio Banderas has been better in some other movies, but he's relatively weak in his performance here. One bit of trivia on this is it was in theatres the same year that a movie called The Thirteenth Floor was in theatres. The two movies have plots that are totally unrelated to each other, but their titles are obviously similar. Overall, I don't think it was that good of a film.",5.0,Anonymous,History
entertaining adventure,"Suspenseful, big budget action/adventure epic which vividly recreates the ancient times of vikings and barbarians.

Starts slowly but only gets better and better as it goes along with sumptuous production, thrilling action scenes and swordplay, genuine scares, and a rousing, old-fashioned sense of adventure.

Only movie that stays true to Crichton book,"As a HUGE Michael Crichton fan, avid reader of all his works, I have been disappointed time after time when his novels are made into movies. Ex: Jurassic Park, Sphere, Congo, Rising Sun, are all terrible movies, despite big-budgets and A-list actors, that deviate horribly from Crichton's original vision.However, such as different with 13th Warrior, from veteran director John McTernin (Die-Hard,Thomas Crown Affair, Predator). This big-screen version of the short novel by Crichton originally titled ""Eaters of the Dead"", is the truest book to screen film I've encountered.With grand battle scenes and great looking cast, 13th Warrior is a true hero-adventure film, with all the perks that go along with it. Banderas is great, as usual, and the unknown cast that makes up the Viking warriors is equally good.Why audiences might be put out about is the jumpyness and uneven flow of the film. We get almost no perspective of the mysterious ""riders in the night"". This, along with all the jumpyness and weird-lack of movie closure-ending, is due to the way the book is written. Crichton simply elaborated on the already existing journal entries of the real Iban Flalad, who documented his journies and adventures in the 14th century.YES, this is a movie loosely based on the (historian-skeptical) true story of Iban Falad. Crichton simply gives it a few sprinkles here and there to make it more interesting. However, in writing it, he keeps true to the holes and loops that an unreligiously kept journal may yield... this also translates onto the big-screen.Bottom Line: You'll like this movie, not great, but good.

A great film about the psyche of men,"The premise of this story is simple. A lonely village in ""The North"" sends a messenger to ask for help from Buliwyf and his band of Northmen who are informed by a witch that 13 men must go to the aid of the place which is troubled by a dragon or monster of some kind. Other villages in the area have disappeared and no one has heard from them. Ahmed or ""Ibn"" joins them as a Persian prince who slept with a powerful man's wife and has been evicted from his homeland. The king makes him an ambassador to ""barbarians"" who live in other lands. Where he meets up with Buliwyf and his men. The witch says the ""13th man"" must be an outlander, and thus Ibn is recruited to join them. Over time, he starts to understand their language and customs (which he thinks are very barbaric at first) and wins over the Northmen as he and Buliwyf defend the village of an old dying nobleman.This is one film that gives men goose-bumps because it shows the best characteristics of what men do best and every man wants to do. Protect and fight for his home. It's something that was bred in us but that we no longer do. We fight for country but seldom get the chance to fight for village. I don't know any guy that would turn down the chance to join ""Ibn"" and this band of Vikings deep down.A great film that men of the modern age could try to aspire to...to be strong, brave, honorable, and just...and deal with our weaknesses as best we can.

Viking Saga Well Worth Several Viewings,"I have to admit this is one of my favourite films and I've watched this probably 7 or 8 times; each time I've never felt it a waste of time. There is realism, a believable storyline and a pace that entertains. The odd joke is based more on what I'd guess would be warrior humour especially in tight situations. The weapons and armour, ships and drinking halls all look realistic like Lord of the Rings, rather than the foam and wool rubbish from other films. Myth & Legend is written all over this saga and a actors like Dennis Storhøi I think make the film. The 'Band of Brothers' seem cosmopolitan and this could be easily comprehended due to the trading links of the Viking fraternity in the 10th century. It works, gels and gives an added dimension, especially when the old Norse is being spoken early on in the film. A clever bit of translation right at the very beginning of the film.

Tony Curran gives a strong and humorous performance. The actors' abilities were just as beautiful as the landscape. I don't know where this film was made, but the haunting scenery was scary.Each character is deeply developed. With a flick of an eyelid, or a tightening of the lips, the emotions come across clearly and expressively.Most films these days like to portray ""bad-guy-is-Muslim"" kind of attitudes which are frankly easy and redundant. This story had a completely different premise. The dialogues were thoughtfully scripted, with open-minded approaches to both cultures.

Why did they bother?,"This is probably the worst would-be swashbuckler I've ever seen. It's more like a two-hour trailer than a movie. No character or scene in it is fully realized. The camera takes astonishingly little interest in any of the clothes, weapons, dwellings, ships, or other artifacts of the period, and the fights are shot so closely in as to reveal nothing. One has only to compare these evidences of inattention to the same director's treatment of modern subjects, e.g. in Predator or Die Hard, to recognize that he isn't one whose imagination extends into the past. Perhaps this is why he allows the script to be insufficiently defined as well. After a meandering start, it settles into a series of inconclusive battles and then stops arbitrarily. The story that the main character discloses in narration about how he came to be in the story in the first place is more interesting than all that follows. Would the director - or rather, a different director - had shot that instead.",2.0,Anonymous,History

Why the sword and dragon movie died.,"This movie is summed up best by its ""large"" battle scene. The opposing army slowly plods up to the the city, mechanically throw their torches in order to burn the village down, and then, surprise, is confronted by a rather ragtag assembly of spikes at the gate that somehow make the opposing army actually stop. Funny thing is though just before Banderas jumped OVER the spikes on a horse (real good defense guys) and really, the spikes have the sharpness of a Crayola marker. Of course, the defenders of the city rejoice at this, say a couple witty lines, some bit charactdrs die, they knock off some of the weirdo opposing army, and everyone goes home happy.Everything feels very mechanical. The actors just seem to be going through the motions, the script is standard fantasy fare, and evidently the director decided to just keep everything zoomed in, so you could admire the actors grizzly faces. I honestly don't think there is a scene where any of the actors DON'T take up all the screen.Dreadful, dreadful movie.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Religions introduced as positive Vikings welcoming,"I am not a Viking expert, but I can imagine there must have been one on the set in terms of continuity, and for those Viking obsessers who will watch this film! The Vikings were not analysed in this film with a magnifying glass, but rather, more a curious approach of intelligence and humanity was injected into their demeanor. Warriors, yes, brutal, yes - and also curious, with a person from Baghdad who prayed to Muhammad. There wasn't any stereotype of 'terrorists profiling' of Antonio's character who was referred as 'little brother' by his new Viking friends. This film was made before 911, and he was welcomed by the vikings as the 13th warrior to become a brother with them on their protective journey to defeat the unknown. I enjoyed the language scenes and the character's learning curve of it,the training scenes and preparations, and the cunning nature of the Vikings, also the playful teasing of each other. It makes me wonder if there ever was a scroll written of this story hidden away somewhere in a historical library in Baghdad. Great movie!!! I would have given this movie 9 out of 10, if the enemies were given more in depth of who they were.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Connection to Beowulf,"This is an excellent film, both artistically and for its connection to British Literature's Beowulf. As an instructor, I use this film in the classroom to engage students in animated discussion after reading the epic Beowulf. I found that it really helps students comprehend the idea of the dedicated warrior--one who lives for the next battle and believes that dying in battle is the ultimate honor. The casting in this film is brilliant and enchanting. You readily accept the connection between the Arab and the Norsemen. In a day and time when many cannot see beyond their own interests and desires, this film helps remind history and literature lovers of a time when honor and dignity included what you give back in this world.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Satisfying.,"THE 13TH WARRIOR is based on the book by Michael Crichton, the author of JURASSIC PARK. And, yet again, he has decided to create another film about man-eating monsters. Only this time, he slaughters the epic Beowulf in the process. This film fits right into the category along with JURASSIC PARK, ANACONDA, LAKE PLACID and all of those other killer monster flicks out there. Only, this one is more like a film that would later come to inspire BROTHERHOOD OF THE WOLF. Which was also basically a repeat of SLEEPY HOLLOW and FROM HELL.Antonio Banderas, who I had never of before this, does a decent acting job. The film is believable enough with the creatures displayed wonderfully. My only problem is that I couldn't figure out one damn person's name or tell you who was who. Omar Sharif? Couldn't tell you who he was. Maybe next time, they could actually get some more famous people to star in their movies. Especially since this is such a big budget film. Other than that, I can't find once shred of un-originality. Just take this film as a basis and make it a little better, and you'd have had a great film on your hands.

The Fun Starts Now!,"I really enjoyed both the look and feel of this movie which I believe is destined to become a favorite of not only Antonio Banderas fans but also of this great action director.  From the start of the film to the last scene, this movie gives the action fan something to grab on to and keeps your interest throughout.  The personalities in the film were well inserted into the plot and right away each main character is easily identifiable as some one that I have known in my life.  The joyous and wise character that takes Ibn under his wing is funny and severe at the same time and much more complex than he appears at first introduction.  The leader of this band of warriors is likeable, courageous, strong and the kind of leader that men willing follow into the lion's den because they know that he is a man of integrity and that he will lead the way.  This movie meant much more to me than the video interpretation of the writer's thoughts, which by the way everyone knows that you won't find a better writer that Michael Cricthon. There were moments in this movie that gave me goose bumbs because of the brotherhood shared by the thirteen warriors and their unfortunate hosts of rag-tag villagers, who they are honor bound to aide in a very dark time. The last 15 minutes of the movie was awe inspiring.  A moment that humbles men of valor and I believe always has throught the human struggle to survive against all opposition.  Don't let the PG-13 rating fool you, there is gore that might be disturbing to the faint of heart and very small children, but the language is very clean for a movie with this type of rating and I felt that every scene was carefully placed in the movie for it's value to the overall story and nothing gratuitous was interjected to sell tickets or cheapen the original story.  I would have loved to see out takes from this one.  In the same vain of great movies like ""The Vikings"" with Tony Curtis & Kirk Douglas, and the all time classic ""Spartacus"" or the little known film ""The 300 Spartans"" starring I believe Richard Egan as the Warrior King, the 13th Warrior is an entertaining and enjoyable movie that can be watched over and over and enjoyed as much as the first viewing.  Of course I won't go into the plot but suffice it to say that a few are sent to help many and that there is no lack of courage in the band of the 13 Warriors.  A great story, a great movie, a graphic portrayal of ""men of valor"", let the fun begin.  I watched this movie recently on DVD with DTS surround and Wow! What an experience.

"Well Above Average, Short, Engrossing Guy Movie","The first time I saw this little movie, I was struck by the mood of realness this movie carries. This movie comes closer than any movie I have ever seen in depicting the Viking Norse as real people, much closer in depicting them as contemporary historians described them. It helped tremendously to have a central Arab character to act as the narrator as we today come closer to his viewpoint than that of the Norse warriors. In seeing it the second and third time, I was then struck by the simplicity of the story line and the way the characters fill out this movie. Being of ""northern European"" stock myself, I saw the movie Norsemen do things that I saw my father and grandfather do, things the womenfolk called ""nasty"" but seemed perfectly unremarkable to the menfolk. My wife doesn't care much for the movie, but I found it totally engrossing. That may be a product of the central theme of the movie. A Norse colony is under attack in the movie from a matriarchal society of Mother Goddess worshipers who happen to also be cannibals. The Norsemen may be gritty and nasty, but as seen through the eyes of the Arab, they were honest, intelligent, loyal, fearlessly brave, religiously respectful of their elders, and shameless in their devotion to Odin All-Father. This is a guy movie and it has some great actors in it. In the end, the Arab thanked God that these men awoke in him a re-dedication to that which is good.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Great Movie!,"I first saw the movie several years ago, then purchased the DVD. It was in my notebook computer when the computer was stolen. I purchased the DVD a second time... and again, the computer, while with that DVD in it, was stolen! Now for the 3rd time, yet again, I have purchased the DVD, but this time, I am strictly using my DVD player to watch it. This goes to show how much I really like this movie... I would call it a classic, but others would digress. The acting of Antonio Banderas as a foreigner adapting to the strange customs of the ""North-Men"" is indeed commendable. And the sheer force of personality by Buliwyf, the leader of the vikings, and the savoir faire of the Blonde translator gentleman are worth watching. The action is pretty intense too... not a smash and burn senseless movie, the 13th warrior builds on the suspense. The Bear-warriors are very skillfully portrayed as an ancient evil, and it is done without exaggeration and mindless violence. The ancient Viking cultural aspects are also quite wonderfully presented. But what really sets this movie apart is the attention to detail... the banter between the warriors and the rough camaraderie they share, the way the slightly obese warrior with the steel armor winces when he makes a noise while crawling through the enemy caves, and other several such finer details which the Director has skillfully woven in to the story to give it an authentic feel.

Couldn't get into it,The 13th Warrior was one of the most disapointing movies I've seen recently. I was disappointed because it could have been a much better movie if the story had been told properly.  Too many details were left out of the story in order I suppose to keep it from dragging and to put less space between the action sequences.  You were never able to truly care about any of the characters individually so you didn't care what happened to them as a group. It would have thought it just fine to see and hour more of this movie so that it was explained better and I would have cared about what might happen to the characters.,4.0,Anonymous,History

The worst part about this movie was the fact that there were so many holes left in the plot after the movie.  Right after Banderas found out he was ""The Thirteenth Warrior,"" in the next scene you see him going out with the other twelve warriors, not even questioning a thing!

Enjoyable Viking Adventure,"A thoroughly enjoyable adventure film. While the film's production problems were well publicised, the final version fits together well, despite some jumps in the narrative and an ending the feels a bit rushed. Furthermore, it doesn't ensure that some genuinely interesting supporting character's development comes to a satisfying conclusion.However, that doesn't overtly mar this story. The film generates a genuine atmosphere of adventure, suspense and fear, and some of the action sequences are thrilling. This is helped by Peter Menzies's photography and above all by Jerry Goldsmith's thunderous score. Greame Revell's original score is interesting, but in no way matches the power of Goldsmith's music, and it was definitely the right decision by producer and writer Michael Crichton to replace Revell's score with a new one by Goldsmith as part of his process of taking over the production and re-editing the film himself as a result of poor test screening results. It is an interesting to note however, what John McTiernan's vision of this film was bearing in mind he left the production before completion when Crichton took over.The story is solid, and the journey is seen from the perspective of Arab poet turned diplomat played very well by Antonio Banderas. One of this films key strengths is the chemistry of the Viking group actors, in particular the towering performance from Vladimir Kulich the leader Buliwyf; the entertaining one from Dennis Storhoi as Herger, and a very engaging one from Daniel Southern as Edgtho. The antagonist is largely faceless and is a collective for most of the film. The device used to keep the audience interested is therefore the excellent interplay between the whole Viking group and Banderas's character.Actions scenes are well done, and work brilliantly with the aforementioned score. But as is the case with these large profile action films, the ending is what lets the film down. This is due to a rush at the film's conclusion, so while the Buliwyf's character's arc is satisfyingly resolved, this isn't the case for the remaining characters. We don't see what the other Vikings motivations or plans are post climax, and even Banderas's character resolution feels rushed and isn't sufficiently built up to a level that is appropriately satisfying. A hint at a romantic interlude with a local Norse woman is never resolved and looks like a potentially studio driven intention to have a quick ending as the film runs quiet long. Audiences however, will accept a good story, even if the film runs longer (e.g. Dances With Wolves, Lord of the Rings, Avatar) and I felt that the film- makers should have taken their time to sign the characters off with satisfying and complete character arcs.Overall though, an enjoyable and exciting adventure.",,Anonymous,History

A boring story against a mediocre backdrop,"Unspectacular adventure film tries vainly to mimic successful traits of past explorer-type movies, though really has no script to back any of the budget up. Those that get excited and long for the glory days of action ala Conan and Indiana Jones may have little else to turn to these decades, but as the uneventful proceedings of the 13th Warrior show, one needs to have a driving sense of mystery in order to perpetuate the adventure.This film has none of that. With a simple premise setting these 13 warriors off to counter an evil force, the uninspired screenplay simply brings viewers through the tired motions. Antonio Banderas, not as bad as I thought he would be here, can still hardly do anything to rescue this methodical homage to cinematic glory days of old. He plays The 13th Warrior, a foreigner who has been chosen to accompany a rogue group of vikings on their quest to seek out and destroy this evil presence.And that, is basically as specific the will plot gets here. Banking on pricey set design and pseudo-spectacular battle sequences, the mediocre project fails because it does nothing to invest the viewer into what producers must have felt was priority here, making the entire journey feel like a few over-bloated set pieces with nary an explanation to hold the action together. Director John McTiernan, of Die Hard fame, is just not in his element here, and with careless editing, lackluster performances, and a shallow story from Michael Crichton, The 13th Warrior will be unnecessary to all but adventure film fanatics.",4.0,Anonymous,History

Cracking yarn,"I found this troubled production to be hugely entertaining and it is one I enjoy watching time and again. The basic idea is that Ibin (Antonio Banderas) is a wealthy Arab. A well educated man whose elitist (he walks palatial halls) and scholarly (he describes himself as a poet) lifestyle comes to a steady halt due to him being exiled by the Caliph for being a little too ""friendly"" with a married woman.Exiled far to the North with a small entourage including (Omar Sharif) he happens upon a camp of Vikings or ""Northmen"" where he witnesses the ritual burial of a king and the rather swift and violent election of a new leader! A messenger arrives at the camp and 13 warriors are called for to travel back to their homeland to a kingdom besieged by beasts. As one of the warriors must not be a Northman Ibin is coerced to join this ""task force"".I enjoyed the visual poetry as well as the musical score, I found each to be very rich and whilst there wasn't much time spent on character development I found I could engage with and care for what was on offer.During the arduous journey (a lengthy passage of time condensed for movieland) Ibin passes the time by watching and listening to his compatriots; we see that these north men are a fairly robust but amiable bunch as they poke fun at each other and talk about their wifes and lives. As an educated fellow skilled in language and writing Ibin manages to communicate with his compatriots and at the end of the long, did I mention, long, journey he learns to speaka de lingo (so to speak).Upon arrival at the homeland the 13 warriors find that they are up against a bear worshipping tribe which they can only stop by killing the Witch / Mother and the tribal Leader. Whilst achieving their goal we are treated to a mixture of myth, legend, action, and adventure, all wrapped up in great cinematography and music.That said, the film undoubtedly has flaws, the unfinished plot line concerning the Kings son is unforgivable for a major studio and I echo those comments calling for a directors cut.Even with its flaws, it beats many other films hands down and is a welcome addition to the genre.",8.0,Anonymous,History
silly adventure melodrama,"Credit the makers of ""The 13th Warrior"" with at least trying to revive that moribund genre of the late 1950's and 1960's - the truly wretched, utterly inane warring-barbarian epic, wherein hordes of badly dressed huns, tartars and Vikings smash away at each other with swords and scimitars to no discernible point or purpose.  That such a film is even attempted in this day and age speaks volumes about either the box-office bravery (should the folly succeed) or financial foolishness (should it fail - which it did) of the movie's corporate backers.Antonio Banderas, who will assuredly not count this as one of the finest hours of his already mediocre film career, stars as a foppish, weak-spined Arabian diplomat who is exiled from Baghdad for an inappropriate dalliance and finds himself an unwitting and reluctant member (the 13th warrior) of a band of Norsemen who have been sent out on a rescue mission to help defend a northern village from attacks by a mysterious malevolent force that comes charging out of the forest on misty nights.  In typical '90's fashion, the filmmakers are not content to play straight with the subject matter but must imply all sorts of supernatural elements, presumably to keep skeptical and more sci-fi oriented modern audiences from hooting the material off the screen.  All those scoffers who deprecated ""The Blair Witch Project"" for not providing enough of a glimpse of the horrors implied therein get their comeuppance in this film since the mysterious terror in the woods here turns out to be literally a bunch of guys dressed in snicker-inducing bear suits. The screenplay is a confused mess, replete with important characters that are dropped without any explanation and actions that seem, at times, entirely lacking in motivation.About the only new ground this tedious action film manages to break can be found in Banderas' main character who emerges as rather a cowardly ninny at the beginning, but who, alas in more typical fashion, ends up rallying with the other boys to help save the day.  Still, credit the film with trying to smash the mold of pure blue heroic protagonist at least part of the way. And, perhaps, far from incidentally, the film affords an opportunity for an aging Omar Sharif to hoist himself back onto a camel and roam the desert as he rediscovers his ""Lawrence of Arabia"" roots after all these years.  Is is a sadly nostalgic sight.All of which only goes to show that even the most minor diversion shines forth in a major way in a film otherwise utterly devoid of all interest as ""The 13th Warrior.""",,Anonymous,History
"Nice horses, way too much death folks!","I appreciate a great use of horses as much as the next person, but the abuse of the flying W technique and backfalls were just nasty.  Add to that, the use of yanks using only the bits (and the tack was horrible too)is just that, abuse.

Don't miss the point,"Most of the comments I saw on 13-th warrior were negative - either the plot is hollow, or Gladiator is better, etc. OK, Gladiator is a better gladiator show, and there are better plots, and battle scenes and guys speaking Hjfghdueiueonian language from the start till the end, really consistently. (Can anybody tell me though why Hamlet or Maximus, if you insist, so consistently speak English?) But to me this is a real fairy tale - about dignity, friendship and much much more. There could be a poor plot and a great film, not so fancy costumes and a great film. So I usually give 10/10 for anything I like very much, despite the shortcomings, and 1/10 for anything that is ridiculous and boring and irritating. The Thirteenth Warrior - maybe 1/10 for speaking something instead of something, 3/10 as a gladiator film, and 10/10 for The Thirteenth Warrior.",10.0,Anonymous,History
I Guess I Really Do Not Understand This Film,"From the director of ""Medicine Man"", ""Last Action Hero"" and ""Predator""... and the writer of ""Twister"" and ""Congo""... comes ""The 13th Warrior"", starring a Spaniard as as Arab.When I watched this film, I had been drinking and talked through much of the movie. Also, it was on a dubbed VHS tape so the picture quality was not optimal and made the darker scenes a little less easier to follow. However, I still think the film was rather weak.If you want action, with swords flying, fire burning, arrows and horses doing back-flips, you will probably be a fan of this film. There certainly is a large amount of swordplay and epic battle. But in almost every other category, there is much to be desired.I did not find there to be any comedy or romance, very little suspense and the plot seemed absurd. Vikings are in Baghdad looking for an Arab to fulfill a prophesy to fight an ancient evil. This is already odd, but then as the film continued, the ancient evil seemed to be something that could have been defeated with any common army - no Arab necessary - and the movie never explains who they are (although I understand the book makes this very clear). Never mind the fact an Arab can learn fluent Norwegian in a matter of days.The only scene I really enjoyed was with two Norsemen having a duel. While it seemed unrelated to the plot as a whole, I think it added more to the characters than anything else in this film.As I said, if you like a lot of swordplay, this might be a good film to see. But otherwise, I think you would be better off renting something else... this is certainly not the best film from McTiernan, Crichton or Banderas...",4.0,Anonymous,History

Yuck!,"Sometimes blood and gore are essential to the plot (for example, ""Sleepy Hollow""). Sometimes they cannot be essential to the plot because there isn't really one. Unfortunately, the latter is my impression of this long, bloody, brutal, boring movie.To be fair, the three friends with whom I saw this movie loved it. A couple of them have purchased the video or DVD. I cannot for the life of me figure out why. Perhaps if your goal is to see a head ripped completely off of a torso you can overlook the absence of things such as plot and compelling characters. Maybe it won't bother you that there are so many things that cross the line of believability (and not even in fun or imaginative ways). Maybe you won't care that this movie has the **world's most unnecessary** ""romance"" (and I use the term loosely) ever or that what you think is supposed to be a major obstacle to our ""heroes"" vanishes without a trace. If these things don't bother you and you don't mind seeing people act like animals (my apologies to real animals everywhere), then this may be just the thing for you! I just simply don't get it.

"A good old-fashioned, red-blooded adventure story....","I love this movie and never get tired of watching it. It's not perfect, but who cares -- it's a lot of fun. Funny thing: friends of mine who would probably enjoy ""The 13th Warrior"" never bothered to see it because they were tired of Antonio Banderas, but frankly, I thought this was one of his best performances. He's not really the focus of the story, except from the ""stranger in a strange land"" angle, but he delivers a fine, understated performance. The stand-outs are the excellent, largely unknown actors portraying the intrepid band of North-men dispatched on a quest to vanquish the evil Wendol (who are tormenting a neighboring kingdom). The characterizations cover the whole personality spectrum, from the charismatic men-of-few-words such as the superb Vladimir Kulich as the leader, Buliwyf, and Daniel Southern as Egtho ""the Silent,"" to the cheerful and enthusiastic, embodied by the fine Tony Curran as Weath and Dennis Storhoi in a marvelous, central performance as the aptly-named Herger ""the Joyous.""The battle scenes are exciting, and the climactic confrontation with the Wendol is reminiscent of Branagh's ""Henry V,"" right down to the rain and mud. The locations, shot in British Columbia, are gorgeous and evocative of a misty, ominous Scandinavian wilderness. The late Jerry Goldsmith accompanied the action with a stirring score, with an appropriately Wagnerian flavor in the last few scenes of the film.No sex, no foul language, some gore (so be careful if there are kids in the room) -- and the rousing exploits of a group of warriors who, if ever there was a Valhalla, must be drinking mead and singing battle songs in it these days....

Gorgeous Viking flick,"I feel like John Mctiernan's The 13th Warrior doesn't deserve the bum rap it's acquired over the years. Sure it was a flop, sure it has a few clunky parts near the beginning, but for the most part it's a visceral, rousing Nordic adventure flick that's guaranteed entertainment all the way, unless you're a wretched nitpicker. On the list of films about Viking warriors fighting some kind of barbaric enemy against gorgeously shot landscapes (that are all British Columbia no less!) it comes out a winner. Antonio Banderas plays an Arabian (yeah, yeah he's a Spaniard, deal with it) poet with an utterly unpronounceable name who is banished to explore new lands with a companion (Omar Sharif in an all too brief cameo) and attain knowledge from other people. He takes up with a rowdy Viking band, led by the kingly Buliwyf (Vladimir Kulich), who are summoned to their distant homeland to contend with a vicious threat that is attacking their villages. It being their custom to bring along one warrior who is not of their kind, they bring Banderas with them and venture home. The cinematography in their land is breathtaking, as Mctiernan uses a smoke machine in overdrive to give the hills, trees and meadows an ancient, ethereal look. They discover the menace that looms over their land is a primitive tribe of savages, and engage in spectacular battle against them. There's several sequences that shine in particular and will give your TV a workout, including a blood spattered, hazy opening battle and a wicked siege in a subterranean cave. Banderas always makes a stalwart protagonist, whether he's brash and cocky (The Mask Of Zorro) or moody and stoic (Desperado). Here he brings a wonderful naivety that's very unlike him, and uses the eventual horror and ghostly events of his character's journey to burnish his arc nicely to a point where his eventual combat scenes feel earned, having both weight and consequence. The Viking tribesman are all played with blue eyed ferocity by a tireless troupe, with especially fine work from Dennis Storhøi as Joyous, an incredibly brave warrior who Banderas finds a relatable kinship with. The years have somewhat buried the memory of this one, but it still stands as a stirring action epic with photography that is kind to the eye, combat scenes that lay the hammer down considerably in the violence department, and a story that vaguely mirrors the timeless Beowulf while adding its own dash of bloody adventure.",10.0,Anonymous,History

I thought Speedo58's post was superb although, as a Middle eastern historian, I've always thought (1) Arabs should be played by Arabs and (2) Ibn Battuta should have received some recognition from both Michael Crichton and the film's producer and director. As much as I love Kurosawa's work, I can't BELIEVE anyone would confuse this tale with either his ""Seven Samurai"" or Yul Brynner's westernization as the ""Magnificent Seven""?? Too bad Dennis' career suffered a blow as a result of the film's reduction to a bit of a cult film status.

Rambo with swords and shields but even that is too much of a compliment.,"When adventure films are good, that usually means they are fun. Indiana Jones and The Mummy are good examples of adventure films from recent times that have withstood the short test of contemporary time. Action films cannot help but impose upon additions to the genre; but when you see a bad adventure film, you know it's bad when the narrative is dull and routine; when the action scenes are short and unspectacular and when certain events that occur happen because the genre demands they happen, rather than because the film is trying something new and original.In The Mummy, from the same year; there were these ancient Egyptian beetles that were reminiscent of piranhas only they weren't constricted to water; in the Indiana Jones films, we were given good, constructive bad guys who we enjoyed seeing get pummelled and beaten by the hero; we like the special effects in both films, the characters and the beauty of the locales. In The 13th Warrior, surely the now obvious 'beginning of the end' for director John McTiernan, we are given grubby looking cinematography set amongst a backdrop of boring and uninspiring settings; we are presented with action scenes so dull and unimpressive we actually feel cheated; we are presented with some of the most boring, one-dimensional characters ever committed to an action film and we are insulted with a narrative so plain and so uninteresting that to even repeat it would waste time and insult intelligence.That is to say the actual narrative for The 13th Warrior is just bland and routine. Antonio Banderas plays an Arab with a Spanish accent among a group of Vikings who are portrayed in an equally insulting light. Banderas' character's name is even so long and such a mouthful that it too could be seen as insulting toward the typical Arabic name, in fact it's so long one could assume the writers were playing for laughs more than anything else. Action heroes need a short and sharp name, something cool and sharp to reflect their persona: Han Solo, James Bond, Indiana Jones; hell, even Rick O'Donnell would do but we are given ""Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan Ibn Al Abbas Ibn Rashid Ibn Hamad""? It's no wonder the Vikings laugh at him as we are doing the same. After a very young boy travels the length and breath of the land (the length it takes to learn a new language), seemingly on his own, to deliver a mere message that they are under attack from 'monsters', twelve Vikings take it upon themselves to travel and help out but with one catch: the 13th warrior must be foreign. If you can get past the fact this little ancient 'rule' still seems like a necessity to be included in a time of crisis, then you might miss how very handy it is that Ahmed was even there; otherwise who else was going to go? Omar Sharif's character? I'd like to have seen that.Ahmed goes on a journey with these Vikings whom are portrayed as big, disgusting troll like people who wash themselves in each others spit and happily kill one another over the last piece of drumstick at meal times. Likewise, the Arabs seem to have a certain class; a certain sort of swagger that can only be put down to Hispanic Banderas' good looks and Spanish elegance. In the film, Banderas has another opportunity to swish and sway enemies with his sword, just as he did in The Mask of Zorro a mere twelve months earlier. But this time, there is no class nor is there the feeling of adventure or excitement; unlike that film, The 13th Warrior heads nowhere bar an abyss of horrible action set pieces and boring logic. The 'monsters' of the piece turn out to be nothing more than bears with swords and shields, how dull and that's when we're supposed to truly believe that they're monsters. What Banderas discovers that no one else for the hundreds of years that they've been attacking the Viking villages is that these monsters are actually men, black men; in costume. Yes, racism starts to run a little thick and a little fast here. Boring, faceless, seemingly voodoo obsessed black people who are able to not only control the weather but live in an underground system of caves and such, during which they can survive and develop utopias of rope bridges and democratic systems that govern who are the fighters and who are the leaders: they are like human ants who every now and again, like to pop up to the surface and start a bit of bother. Their 'kind' have been doing this for centuries, might I add.And then the genre movie kicks in. The Vikings and Ahmed lie in a circle as the monsters approach but nobody decided to give Ahmed any training with the Viking sword that he clearly cannot use but that's only established AFTER the first fight scene. He says so himself he is no warrior but he drops a few of these monsters no problem. The fights are frequent, dark and unintelligible when they're at their most mediocre. The film descends into a Warcraft style narrative when the characters have to visit some crazy old woman who speaks more sense than she looks like she's able to: ""Kill the leader!"" she exclaims. Yup, that might work. After seeing off hoards of the monsters who were armed with torches and swords and whom could so easily have taken the allied camp in one swoop if they really tried to, the Vikings and Ahmed make a counteroffensive into the lair; something nobody thought of in centuries gone by. A final word on the closing battle scene: absolute crap. A three minute montage of swishing swords and funny faces in slow motion and it's over, as is very briefly after the immediate ending, the audience's will to live.",4.0,Anonymous,History
A Great Adventure Move: Easily the best Viking movie ever made.,"This is the film version of Michael Criton's book, ""The Eaters of the Dead.

Vladimir Kulich is perfect as the Viking King without a Kingdom who leads the band of 13. But Dennis Storhoi steals every scene he is in. He is excellent, with a deft balance of drama and humor in his performance. 
I love the way the Vikings are depicted in this movie, not as mindless brutes, but as extremely intelligent, calculating, warriors. The directing is superb, I particularly liked the way the director showed how Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan learned the Viking tongue by listening through a series of transition scenes around the evening camp fire as the Vikings traveled to their destination. The battle scenes could not be better, extremely violent, but not excessively gory (well maybe a little excessive).

The Film's story isn't fully right. Here is the true story of this great scientist (Ahmed Ibn Fadlan).,"Ahmed bin Fadlan is a well-known Islamic scholar in Islamic history. He was a writer, geographer, and explorer dating back to the tenth century. He wrote his description of his journey as a member of the Abbasid caliphate embassy
About the Muslim traveler Ahmed bin Fadlan:-
His full name is Ahmad Ibn Al-Abbas Ibn Rashid Ibn Hammad Al-Baghdadi. He was known as Ahmad Ibn Fadlan, born in 877 in Baghdad, and died in 960.
Ahmad Ibn Fadlan gave the oldest description of Russia in 922, and the scholar Ahmad bin Fadlan visited Russia with a message from the Abbasid caliphate. When Ibn Fadlan arrived in Bulgaria in 922, contemporary Tatarstan took this day to celebrate, and made it an official holiday. Ahmed bin Fadlan was not only a talented man or a political statesman, but he was in front of his eyes behind the unique scenes, and was always preoccupied with his mind analysis without monitoring. He worked for a long time about ten years right assistant to the military commander Mohammed bin Suleiman, and learned in this period of him a lot through contact with different peoples, until he reached the Abbasid caliph (Muqtadir Billah) as a jurist in the state and Islamic researcher. The scholar Bin Fadlan continued to be promoted in the court of the Caliph Muqtadir Billah, and at the time of the arrival of a letter from the Bulgarians at the request of an embassy sent by the Caliph to Bulgaria to explain the principles of the Islamic religion there; The lawsuit's journey to Islam, which was supported by Ahmad Ibn Fadlan, moved from Russia, Iraq, Iran, to Central Asia, to Bulgarian countries, to Russian territory, to the Caspian kingdom, and to the Scandinavian peninsula at the North Pole.
The West admitted that this journey made rare cultural discoveries, and the name of Ibn Fadlan existed in bold letters in the history of the arrival between Islam and the modern world. Ibn Fadlan described Russia When he was present in Russia, he gave an accurate description of the land of Russians, and described everything that exists in this country; he described their men, the status of women, the population, the way of life, the burial of the dead, beliefs in God, and other Things that are in Russia. He also talked a lot about building wooden houses in Russia and worshiping idols, Russian merchants' fondness for dinars, silver dirhams, funeral ceremonies, and cremation in boats. Some sayings of Ibn Fadlan about Russia, The most famous of his words (and the jewelers have green beads of porcelain, which is on the vessels exaggerate, and buy bead beaded dirhams, and make jewelry for women). (If they hit a thief, they brought him to a large tree, tightened a tight rope in his neck, hung him in it, and remained suspended until he was cut off by the wind and rain.) He says about their king (the king does not come down from his bed, if he wanted to spend a need, he was doing in a bowl, and has a commander who heads armies and faces enemies, and takes care of the affairs of the people).
The impact of Ahmed bin Fadlan on the general culture:-
The journey of the Islamic scholar Ben Fadlan was the basis of the novel written by Michael Crighton, called the ""Eaters of the Dead"".
A book was published about the biography of Ahmed Ibn Fadlan called (The Adventures of the Ambassador of the Arabs) by the writer Ahmed bin Salam Al-Bakali, and a Syrian TV series called (Roof of the World) talks about the adventures of Muslim traveler Ahmed Ibn Fadlan without falsification, distortion or fraud.

Ignore the reviews. The 13th Warrior is the best Viking epic of all time!,"The greatest historical Viking battle epic you never heard of. Just like Jurassic Park and Westworld, The 13th Warrior is based on a Michael Crichton book and boasts an incredible action director, John McTiernan (Die Hard, Predator), Antonio Banderas as the leading man at the top of his career, excellent practical effects and beautiful sets and costumes. Yet, critics obliterated the film, and it failed at the box office, becoming one of the biggest box office flops of all time. I have no idea how this happened or why the reviews are so bad because this is an EXCELLENT movie. The battle scenes in The 13th Warrior are in league with other action epics like Braveheart, The Last Samurai, or Kingdom of Heaven. The story is similar to 300, where a small band of warriors face impossible odds and mixes a little horror with fantastic action and great character development. I'm not sure how The 13th Warrior ended up in the garbage can, but it belongs on the top shelf with the best action epics.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Well directed period piece has an authentic medieval look and feel,"I have read a lot of criticisms of this film here and elsewhere that I don't feel are justified.  I liked this film.  It is an excellent piece of directing from John McTiernan that captures the medieval period realistically.Contrary to most of the criticism that this film is just violence with no plot, this film has a very definite and sound plot.  It is the story of 13 courageous men who are sent to defend the homeland of a respected king from the attack of the Wendol, the creatures of the mist who are thought to be eaters of human flesh.  It is a story of duty, courage, honor and loyalty, and some very brutal battles.What the story lacked was character development and an archetypal hero. Since that is what the masses expect in their films, I'm certain this film was a big disappointment.  That is what made Braveheart a more complete film of this genre.  We had William Wallace as our reason for watching the battles.  If this film starred Gibson or Arnold Schwarzenegger as Buliwyf (played instead by veritably unknown Vladimir Kulich), and spent a little time developing him as a leader, I'm sure everyone would have thought it was a great movie.They only real flaw in the plot was premise that an Arab that they just met, especially one who was not a warrior by profession, would be selected as the 13th warrior.  This was highly contrived.This film was an epic saga of human conflict.  It wasn't some romantic war over a great philosophy or ideal.  It was raw survival against barbaric intruders.  It was typical of life in medieval times.  This is not something today's society can really relate to being a generation that has grown up on sitcoms and fast food and whose idea of a threat is if someone insults their cultural group.  I believe that this is the reason it did not have popular appeal.  The response would probably be the same if The Iliad were made into a film without some character development of Achilles and Hector.McTiernan did an outstanding job of capturing the look and feel of the times.  The locations were fantastic and the sets all very rough hewn.  The cave scenes were also extremely realistic.  The battle scenes were first rate.  He did a fine job of depicting the thinking of medieval men, wrought from a combination of tradition, myth, superstition, and fear of the unknown in a time when almost everything was unknown.The only real error he made was the depiction of Ahmad's (Antonio Banderas) learning of the Northmen's language.  Clearly, he was not trying to make it look like Ahmad learned the language in one night.  Unfortunately, that's the way it came across.  It would have been more effective if he used successive cutaways of him listening in different situations, on the boat, in a field, by the campfire, etc.Of special note, I saw this film on DVD and the sound was fantastic.  This was superb use of all five speakers in the Dolby 5.1 format.  The forest and battle sounds came from everywhere at once.  Characters who rode off the screen, could be tracked audibly as they rode away.  Kudos to the sound designers.Antonio Banderas did as good a job as can be expected given the way his character was written.  Since the hero wasn't the point of this film (the struggle was), and since he wasn't really even the hero (Buliwyf was), Banderas was relegated to being a supporting actor in a starring role.I rated this film an 8/10.  A few minor flaws did not detract from the excellence of the portrayal of the epic.  Not for the faint of heart.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Underrated epic in dark setting,"This is one of the most underrated fantasy/action movies I've encountered. It has a great story with depth and historical accuracy underneath the gritty fantasy elements. The score is absolutely fantastic, one of the most epic I've ever experienced in a movie.Good pacing leaves this movie with little to no boring moments and even the talks-y scenes seem to have a constant suspense and makes you want to hear every word. The fights are fantastic, bloody and will make you clinch your hands. The adversaries are well written and you're often unsure about your thoughts about the nature of these beasts.I do wish they expanded and developed the love aspect a little bit more to flesh out the character of the main character. As it is it feels shoehorned in there like it was edited in at the last minute. I would have also preferred a non-existent love affair over the one in the movie.I have not read the book this is based off (Eaters of the dead) but the movie is most likely inspired by the Japanese classic ""Seven Samurai"", not enough to make it seem like a copy, but enough that if you've seen both you'll see the connection for sure.In all: Very good movie, entertaining and dark and gritty, you'll find your hands sweaty and your eyes not blinking during some parts of the movie and if you enjoyed shows like Vikings, King Arthur, 300, and even films such as Yojimbo, Seven Samurai, and The Last Samurai, you might very well like this one. Give it a shot despite the scores and keep in mind it might not have aged exceptionally but it's got that 90s charm.Expanding a little bit:A lot of Norse mythology went into this movie of course, it being inspired by the story of Beowulf, but I would have loved to see some other references in there. Though if you are Nordic you might recognize a word hear and there when the Norsemen speak their language, as it is based on old Norse which is a sort of mixture of Norwegian, Swedish and other Nordic/Germanic languages. The scene with the oracle is particularly interesting, if you can find a translation to what they're saying I'd love to read it. You can hear her making references to Valkyries (angels of death carrying away fallen warriors to Valhalla) to guide her in the ritual.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"The book is as good, so not better than the movie.",I like the proloog in the book. Michael Crichton explains how he struggled how to write the story. He had a discussion with another writer about mythes and sages and how the evolved in the century's. So the assigned he took was to take an old sage and to go back to the original story. He took Beowulf.,10.0,Anonymous,History
Puzzling Riddle,"The camera focussed much of the time on Anthony Banderas, but apart from him I couldn't really tell any of the other actors apart. Since I had no idea what was happening for most of the film this didn't seem to matter. Eventually I felt I understood that the story being told bore some twisted resemblance to the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf, but this didn't help me much. I understood that the Wendols were a stand-in for Grendel, and his mother. The fundamental insoluble puzzle that I kept asking myself was why on earth I was sitting through this monumental garbage from beginning to end ? Subtitle: Skean/Skein ?",1.0,Anonymous,History

Better Than I Remember,"When I originally saw The 13th Warrior in theaters, I remember being let down a bit. It was a mixture of the misleading flavor of the trailer and the drab and darkness of the film itself. I think I originally believed it was going to be a bit more of a corny action flick than it is. I'll just say it wasn't what I expected and that viewing stuck with me the last 20 years.Upon a more recent viewing, I really appreciate the short, period (relatively) accurate story this turned out to be. I also just realized, that I did not recall it was mostly a retelling of Beowulf-and that's despite having read Beowulf in high school. It's not even subtle now. The names in the movie phonetically sound like the characters from the original epic story.Banderas is charming as the narrator of the story. As the lead, he recounts the tale of a more historical interpretation of Beowulf. The rest of the cast of Viking warriors rounds off the storyline enough to give it a good quest feel. The villains could have been fleshed out just a little bit more in my opinion and the final battle was a tad brief. Overall though, for a short, tight plot this movie is pretty loaded with good violent action-if you're into that sort of thing and the story is an interesting retelling.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Underrated,"I know the word ""underrated"" is so over-used now that it's become annoying, but The 13th Warrior is definitely on my list of the top 25 most under-appreciated movies of all time.Sure, The 13th Warrior has numerous flaws, which every other reviewer has already discussed, so I'm not going to reiterate those flaws here. What makes The 13th Warrior stand-out is its tone and ambience, to which the movie stays faithful from the first frame until the last. The viewer never has reason to question, ""Is this what early 2nd-millennium Scandinavia may have been like? "" And the story-angle of an Arabian Muslim having to find a way to cope and adapt to a land and culture as foreign to him as could possibly be, was brilliant.While I acknowledge the many flaws in this production, which everyone else has already cited infinite times, the good far-outweighs the bad. I could watch this movie once a year for the rest of my life, and never grow bored of it.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Sloppy and illogical, but sometimes entertaining","How do you mess up a plot as simple as THE 13th WARRIOR's?  This is the story of Ahmed ibn Fahdalan (Antonio Banderas), whom the Abbassid caliph appoints as ambassador to the Northmen (interestingly, I don't recall the word `Viking' ever being used in this movie).  The Vikings dragoon him into service against a mysterious tribe of creatures that are attacking the Vikings' villages and eating the flesh of the slain.Screenwriters William Wisher and Warren Lewis competed with each other to see how many holes they could fit in a plot this small; I won't blame Michael Crichton since I haven't read his book.  The foremost absurdity is that we are supposed to believe that just 13 Vikings turned the tide of battle against this strange tribe of hundreds of creatures, even though the king's village has hardly `a man between fifteen and fifty' besides them.  The concept that this tribe can be defeated merely by killing two of its biggest and strongest members is the invention of someone who has only a video-game understanding of war. Ahmed, appointed as an ambassador, never once attempts any diplomatic function; the minute the fighting is over he turns around and goes home!  He also goes from being a poet unskilled with weapons to Zorro-like derring-do in no time flat, without even being trained.  A subplot involving the local king's son leads to a tedious duel scene and then goes nowhere.  The many smaller holes are too numerous to list.Almost lost in the mangled storyline is some very interesting speculation on the origin of medieval myth and superstition.  When the human-flesh-eating beast-men attack, and are beaten off, the bodies of their dead disappear.  Presumably the beast-men carried them off to eat, but to the Vikings demonism seems as logical an explanation as any.  A gigantic fiery snake winds its way down a mountain toward the Viking village.  This turns out to be a column of hundreds of mounted enemies carrying torches, but how many of the women and children who hid in cellars during the battle passed the tale of the fiery `dragon' down to the next generation?  And it's not hard to see the origin of the Beowulf myth in the confrontation with the beast-man tribe's mother priestess in a cave below the earth.Except for Ahmed and one of the Vikings named Herger, the characters are all cardboard.  I was not the only viewer who couldn't keep the twelve Viking warriors straight or attach names to them.  A love interest character named Olga, played by the beautiful Maria Bonnevie, is so poorly drawn that she should have been left out altogether.The acting is a mixed bag.  I like Banderas; it takes a hell of a lot of guts for a man who makes his living as a sex symbol to take on an explicitly homosexual role, which Banderas did and did well a few years back in PHILADELPHIA.  But he's just not very good in THE 13TH WARRIOR.  His voice is exactly the same as in THE MASK OF ZORRO and doesn't sound the slightest bit Arabic.  He is given several dramatic one-liners that he flubs badly.  But he is good at simulating pain, and gives a good sense of stumbling over the words of the unfamiliar Norse language.  Dennis Storhoi as Herger does by far the best job.  He's a heck of a lot of ferociousness and scrappiness in a small package, and his face reminds me of a young Liam Neeson.  Vladimir Kulich has been wildly overrated as Buliwyf; the man never once changes his facial expression or tone of voice.  Schwarzenegger's Conan was Olivier by comparison.  Daniel Southern, playing Eadgtho impressed me with his screen presence, though his accent needed work.  Sven Wollter's King Hrothgar is lethargic and boring.The soul of this film, of course, is its action scenes, and they are good, though sometimes confusing.  The pace of the battles never lets up; they're savage and immediate.  Firelight is well used to evoke the primitivism of the battlefield.THE 13TH WARRIOR does a pretty good job of evoking the atmosphere of early medieval Scandinavia.  There's not a paved road in sight; the roughness and uncouthness of the Vikings and their home is well painted, if maybe a bit overdone at first.  Banderas ' prayer before the final battle is as superb a portrayal of the spirit of the medieval warrior as has ever appeared on screen. The Viking swords look like authentic museum reproductions.  But why are there no battle-axes? Swords were rich men's weapons; to make a Viking movie with no axes is almost sacrilegious. Some of the armor looks suspiciously like 16th-century Spanish breastplate-and-morion gear. Also, British Columbia is a bit verdant to pass for northern Scandinavia.The production values are as good as $100 million can buy.  Jerry Goldsmith's score is enjoyable as always, but it's not one of his greater works.  McTiernan sometimes applies the music poorly, allowing it to stop abruptly where it should have faded out.  Unlike many action movies, this one does not have the humor laid on too thick.  Banderas has an awful slapstick scene, but I enjoyed the chagrined swordsmith's line, `He insisted,' upon seeing his sword carved into a scimitar.I was mildly entertained by THE 13TH WARRIOR, but would recommend it only to genre fans, for whom the rich atmosphere and action scenes may outweigh the illogical plot and poor characterization.  If you see it at all, see it on the wide screen.Rating: ** out of ****.",5.0,Anonymous,History
One of the best adventure movies,"Although not as perfect film, it is a film I have watched 3 times now and liked it each time for new reasons.This a well written and crafted movie.

Not the perfect sword and board but it is as close as you get,"The 13th Warrior is one of those films that flies under the radar. It pays loose homage to classic literature, while holding true to some historical accuracies. At the end of the day though it is still a fantasy and should be viewed in that light.Antonio Banderas' acting is on point and brings a lot to his character. All of the men and women who play Vikings are all amazing in their roles. I particularly enjoy Dennis Storhøi, Vladimir Kulich, and Tony Curran's characters. Herger, played by Dennis Storhøi, by far, is my favorite, he brings some needed comic relief to the serious plot, but it is a comedy of wit and wisdom, not silliness. The ever stoic Buliwyf, played by Vladimir Kulich is a leader that we can all admire. Tony Curran, who plays Weath, always performs well, with solid acting, good comedic timing. His character is strong, but humorous.This is a great film to just sit back and enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"Lots of promise, but too short","I really want to like this movie. It shows lots of promise, the scenery is beautiful and the actors are first rate. Unfortunately, it falls short on a few fronts:First, the movie is just too short. A lot of the story just doesn't make sense. I guess the book is more elaborate, but the movie should at least be twice as long to help give the story some kind of flow instead of making it look like more or less unrelated scenes stitched together.And then there are the fight scenes. They're just no good. Nowadays that we have movies like The Matrix, fight scenes that change so quickly that you have no idea what's going on just doesn't cut it anymore. I had no idea what was going on during the fights, who was fighting against whom or why anything was happening at all (actually, I had that feeling during most of the movie).If you have an hour and a half to waste and this movie is on TV, by all means watch it, but don't bother buying or renting the DVD.",3.0,Anonymous,History

Consistently Refreshing!,Let me start by saying this movie offers a lot of unique elements to the storyline. It has always been a staple movie in my catalogue to revisit when I need a solid movie. I enjoyed the movie because it has both progression of a storyline but also details to it. It's a fantasy action movie and should be treated as such. One major part of the character development that I always highly regarded was that he isn't some war hero or suddenly became this heroic warrior. Instead he slowly develops his skills from being novice to slightly above average thanks to help from his hero like friends. It's a piece of realism often forgotten in movies but in the context of this fantasy action movie it helps provide a sense of validity in the potential of this character and his story.This movie is easily one of my favorite movies to watch and is severely underrated! It does not deserve the low grading it has received by some. I think they either didn't understand the conceptual aspect of the movie or simply didn't care for a good reliable action flick!,9.0,Anonymous,History
Where's this going?,"What's unfortunate about this movie was that it had potential.  The concept was new and original, but the story led me to believe that the first draft was shot.  Usually, dialogue is used to progress a story.  But in this case, dialogue is a distraction.  I found the cinematography pleasing, but not to the extent that it was true visual storytelling. Aside from his small role in Philadelphia, Banderas hasn't accepted a decent role in his career.  I would recommend that only serious fans of Banderas and those who enjoyed the Beowolf theme gamble with their money on this film",5.0,Anonymous,History

Is that suppossed to be a professional Hollywood production???,"This movie really dissappointed me. I didn't expect much from it, and I'm glad I didn't. The story really sucks.

I mean, how could they be hiding if there were thousands of them, along with a horse for each one? Who said Antonio Banderas was the leading character? and who thought he looks like an Arab?But the worst thing is the photography work. I've been in the production of school short films myself, and I bet our work was way better than this trash.In the same scene you can see at least three variations in color.

An entertaining movie that doesn't make a person think too hard,"I enjoyed both the book and the movie immensely. It was one of those old fashioned swashbuckling tales that didn't take itself too seriously. Often people get so caught up in the details that they forget to just sit back and enjoy the movie.The scene where he learns the language of the Northmen by listening, I will admit it was a stretch, but having the whole story told through dialogue in Greek would have really bogged down the story. In the book both Herger and Fadlan speak Latin, and Fadlan slowly picked up the Norse language.The only real error visible that appeared in both the book and movie was Fadlan drinking alcohol. He tells the Vikings that he cannot drink fermentations of grape and wheat. The movie makes it seem that fermentations of honey are permitted. In fact Islamic religious doctrine bans drinking ANY intoxicant which includes drinks made from honey.

The settings were realistic, the brave and wise ""philosophy"" of the vikings was well presented, the action/battle scenes were well done.

See this film if you appreciate folklore and enjoy escaping to another world.,"This is a tale of yesteryear, a bit of fantasy and a bit of bravery. Our narrator is a poet who was banished from his home unjustly and embraced by a group of traveling or marauding warrior Vikings.  The poet does not understand their language, nor do we without benefit of subtitles.  Leaving us to feel his isolation and misjudge these men by our tainted perspective of their actions.  The poet is chosen as one of thirteen men to travel North to fight an evil force that comes in the night.  During the poet's travels, he begins to understand his companions and their language, and with each day he becomes a part of them.  The group of warriors fight several battles for their neighbors at seemingly insurmountable odds, in fact many die. However, the poet lives to recount the tale of these courageous warriors. What I enjoyed about this movie is it transported me to a world so different from my own.  A world and people rarely explored by Hollywood.  A world of simple survival. And the film makers attention to detail in regard to this period, the locals chosen for filming, and the action sequences were excellent. The dialogue was a bit thin, however one might surmise that the warriors were men of action not words. Regardless, the characters are likeable.

However, you're much better off getting these entertaining events from the book by Michael Chrichton than by seeing the movie.

I almost think this a movie that shouldn't be a movie. It just doesn't entertain like a movie, and if it doesn't entertain and doesn't accomplish some social commentary or other worthy goal, why make it--or, more importantly, why see it?

Beowolf (poem) vs. 13th Warrior (movie),"I really liked this movie because it is not set in present tense, it makes it unique in many ways. This movie has a lot of thing in common with the poem Beowolf because they both are based on good vs. evil and how good always comes out winning. In the poem Beowolf, Beowolf is called to come save the towns people from a man eating creature where as the movie the 13th warrior, Antonio is just riding around and happens to become the 13th warrior and told that he has to go fight a war with the monster and his mother. There is a fortune teller in the movie that predicts who is going to live and who is going to die for the war to come unlike in the poem where no one can know what is going to happen, you just know what is going right then. There is so much action in this movie and it is something you just have to see to believe! I really recommend this movie to anyone who likes action and suspense. The action scenes in this movie are so realistic which makes the movie even better, and it is playing out what happened in the poem. It brings the poem to life! As the warriors are riding around following clues to the monster they learn many things about each other and Antonio eventually learns their language and is able to talk to them and understand everything they say. In the bar scene when Antonio finds out that he was chosen to become the 13th warrior he was surprised and he didn't know how to react and what he was going to do but he learned fast. When they found all those bodies all torn up in that house, it was so realistic and it really got you thinking about what is going to happen to them and you want to keep watching to find out. By the end of the movie everyone is glad that the warriors saved the day and everything went back to normal. This movie is one of the greatest movies of all time!",8.0,Anonymous,History

Decent medieval brawl,"Antonio Banderas plays an Arab in this movie, which isn't nearly as weird as I expected it to be. It's kind of a stretch to see him call one of his companions ""a pig-eating son of a whore"", but even that was sorta believable. As for the rest of the film, it's good without really being anything special. A bunch of angry Vikings try to defend their town, and figure the best way to do that is to get some help from Antonio Banderas. The battles look really nice, they're filled with an epic atmosphere and heroic imagery. Since most of the movie is made up from battles, it's pretty entertaining. One does wonder if it was really worth the massive budget (around 100 million, apparently) though, because it's not exactly film history that's written here. In fact, it's not even close to being the best movie in its genre. Still liked it though.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"""Lo, I see my father...""","While the editing is indeed choppy as others have said, THE 13TH WARRIOR is hardly deserving of critical scorn or cinematic obscurity. It's a rip-roaring fish out of water adventure story in which an exiled Arab diplomat finds himself caught up in a dangerous quest with twelve Norse warriors. While the muddy aesthetics suggest the usual ""gritty"" take on historical settings, the tone feels more like the kind of old legend that would be told by a campfire.It's overall an exciting movie with great action and suspense. The interactions between the main character and the Norse men are also both funny and weirdly touching as the two parties come to understand one another. It definitely deserves reappraisal after all these years.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Well crafted adventure story,"On a par with Predator, which isn't surprising as it's directed by McTiernan, and is one of his better efforts. Surprisingly faithful to Crichton's classic Eaters of the Dead, the pace of the film allows for the story to be properly realized, although the five minute attention span crowd might find it slow. An excellent ensemble cast does the screenplay justice.The only mistakes were changing the name, and an inept marketing job.",9.0,Anonymous,History
WHEN MEN WERE MEN,"Another film in the style of ""Bravehart"" and all.The story is some confused tale of an Arab hooked up with Norsemen to protect some tribe that is being seriously put upon by guys with Grizzly Bear headresses.Valhalla is mentioned a couple of times in the script giving the film mythological barings (no pun intended);however,Richard Wagner did it better; as did George Lucas with the original ""Star Wars"".The script is hopeless and the performances are adequate for the drama on hand.The first hour is tedious; the second hour moves well. Banderas, in the lead,does a fine job of looking concerned.He should be considering his recent track record of films.Is this actor deliberately trying to kill a career or what? He has made some good pics, but not for some time.This go around, his character is a void in the middle of the film with no motivating force whatsoever. ""The Thirteenth Warrior"" is not a complete waste of time, though. Cinematography, sets,fur costumes (not an animal rights film - plus horses take quite a beating in the battle scenes) and special effects are all very good.The battle scenes are fun with beheadings and blood spurting all over everyone and not really disturbing, because this movie never becomes at all personal and never gets one emotionally involved. It's distant and theatrical; kind of like a video game.The scenery is great with lots of mist. Check out the great line of fire (torches) as the bear warriors on horseback ride out of the valley to do battle.

My most rewatched film.,"I have rewatched this film 4-5 times a year since it became available digitally. I have admired Antonio Banderas for years as well, but it really it is Dennis Storhøi as Herger the Joyous who is the most fun to watch.Crichton did an amazing job of blending themes from Beowulf with the historical writings of Ahmed Ibn Fadlan, and while I've always been aware of this, it was only when I recently read a relatively new translation of Beowulf (The Grinnell Beowulf, 2013), did it hit me how much of the dialog brought to the film came almost directly from Beowulf. Eg:Beowulf: (from lines 549-564)Fate will often save an undoomed man if his courage is mighty.... I have never heard about you competing in such trying contests...although you did happen to become the slayer of your brothers...Buliwif to the.king's son Wigliff:Luck often enough will save a man if his courage hold...I thank the lord for his advice, but I don't recall hearing any exploits of his, apart from killing his brothers.",9.0,Anonymous,History
slightly disappointed..,"This movie had many things going for it, but unfortunately it ultimately came up short.As a screenplay adapted from Michael Crichton's ""Eaters of the Dead,"" I had high hopes for the ""13th Warrior.""  I'm a fan of the genre and the possibilities -- Viking warriors and mythology, monsters and fierce battles -- sounded good.My biggest complaint is that I never felt a real connection to the characters, while the story moved along with somewhat of a disjointed feel to it.Antonio Banderas is an Arab courtier and the 13th warrior, the one who an oracle says will help the Vikings save one of their villages from the man-eating creatures.  It has somewhat of a ""Magnificent Seven"" feel to it, with the band of Viking warriors trying to come to the rescue of the village.The battle sequences were impressive, as was much of the scenery.The Viking warriors had potential, but their characters never seemed to develop, save for one or two.  At the end of the movie, I vaguely remembered the name of only Banderas's character, and he wasn't especially compelling in the role.Overall, the ""13th Warrior"" was a slight disappointment.  It could have been much better, but seemed to gloss over parts of the stories that needed to be expanded on.",4.0,Anonymous,History

The beginnings of the NFC North rivalry,"The 13th Warrior is a loose adaptation of one of the earliest works of the English language,Beowulf. Just as Beowulf is about non-English speakers but written in English, so are many modern films. And often instead of having actors speak in their character's native language, they speak in English with a corresponding accent. In this film Antonio Banderas(Ibn) and Omar Shariff(Melchisidek),who play Arabs, do just that. Then when the two meet a band of Vikings the film suddenly acknowledges foreign languages. For a good twenty minutes or so the Vikings speak in their native tongue while Ibn speaks in English and Melchisidek translates for him and the audience. After Ibn sets off with the Vikings(and we lose our nifty translator) the film settles the problem in a preposterous manner. By merely watching and hearing them talk he is able to learn their language. And after that all the characters converse in English for the rest of the duration. Which raises the question why was it that they couldn't have been speaking in English from the start ?Though Ibn is the main character of the film the 'hero' in a sense is Buliwyf-not to be confused with Beowulf-and Ibn is just another member of the band while Buliwyf leads the action. One major difference from Beowulf is that in the place of Grendal the antagonist(s) of the film are men disguised as bears. Bears vs Vikings I suppose that's when the NFC North rivalry started.While superior to other Beowulf films The 13th Warrior is a fairly mediocre sword & shields film with all the cliche and flaws that plague most.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Beowulf (with a couple of twists),"This was a very, VERY good movie. While the issues with Norse cultures actually having a written language is valid, the fact that most Scandinavian runic writing could NOT be understood anywhere else on Earth is undeniable. Michael Crichton's 1976 novel, Eaters of the Dead, is next on my reading list. And I'm sure he addresses this in the book.That said, whatever problems there are with the minutiae of the script, they are more than made up for by strong acting by Banderas and Czech actor Vladimir Kulich, good directing by John McTiernan of ""Die Hard"" and ""The Hunt for Red October"" fame and stunning visuals. The fact that this movie did poorly among movie critics simply adds to the list of reasons not to trust movie critics.The trivia note is ridiculous. If Omar Sharif was disappointed enough in this movie to take ""a temporary retirement from acting"", then he should have killed himself after ""Hidalgo"". One must suspect such folly is motivated more by his minimal screen time in the film rather than on the quality of the finished product.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"Lo, There Do I See All Sorts of Stuff....","I can see where some of y'all didn't get off on this...it's dark, it's confusing, etc....but I have to say I thought it was fascinating and really enjoyable.There actually was an Arab who traveled up to the Viking lands and later wrote about it. But the thinking of many of those who think about this stuff is that he must have been irked at his hosts, because he's got the Vikes doing all sorts of unsanitary things, whereas in actuality they were among the cleanest people in the world. That spitting in the washbowl stuff? Nuh- uh. Behavior like that would have been grounds for combat and fines among Celts and Vikings alike. You could actually be fined if you didn't offer an arriving guest an immediate bath... So, lies. Or maybe the Vikings were putting the Arab on...And the ship-burial with attendant sacrificial maiden...maybe, maybe not. I think that Ahmed's diary is the first place where that prayer was written down, though, since the Vikings, like the Celts, were a non-writing, purely oral culture. Also, the tradition with both cultures was that the battle ended when the leader was killed, so the fact that the Wendol were shown fleeing after Hornboy bit the dust is accurate as well.As to the film itself, lovedlovedloved Dennis Storhoi and Vladimir Kulich. Banderas is wooden as ever, though it served him well here, and I was annoyed at the subplots (to do with the women, mostly) that didn't go anywhere. It didn't dawn on me for a while that Weilew was actually the queen, because women in Norse society had a lot of power and she looked pretty powerless. And the blonde who hooked up with Banderas's character kinda came and went out of nowhereland, too.Plus Neanderthals (if that's what they were supposed to be) didn't coexist with modern man--they were gone thirty thousand or more years ago---so not so much there either, and I doubt they'd have had organized cavalry even if they did.Still, as so many have pointed out, we don't see enough movies made from this mythology, so I'm grateful for even an imperfect one.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Enjoyable movie,A very enjoyable film. My favorite Banderas film by far. 9/10.,9.0,Anonymous,History
Classic Norse Saga of the Magnificent Seven,"Of course there are probably hundreds of anachronisms and faulty historical facts but I have to say that this film is one of my favourite fantasy screen sagas. It's a bit bloody and violent and the inclusion of an Arab diplomat in the Northlands is a bit spurious but to be honest it just works.The plot is a bit basic, even B-movie, but what really brings the movie to life is the characterisation of the Norsemen Warriors - a good half-dozen who get a reasonable chance to develop their characters on-screen. Banderas is a likable, slightly effete, exiled Arab diplomat and neatly pulls off the educated philosopher finding his warrior roots. There's also a lot of humour - largely on the part of the extremely watchable Dennis Strohøi and the 'buddy movie' plot between his character and Banderas' is one of the film's best points. The hero Buliwyf is also not one-dimensional and he shows depth other than his ability to lead men and hack his enemies to death. Having said that there's a fair amount of hacking and slaying to watch but the battle scenes are actually pretty good, gritty, dirty set-pieces and the Norsemen by no means invincible. In a way I guess it resembles more the Magnificent Seven rather than the saga of Beowulf upon which it was loosely based. And that's probably the best comparison - village besieged by evil doers that the heroes finally vanquish but at no insignificant cost to themselves.Throw in some nice touches to the Dark Ages world they live in (even if historically inaccurate in places) and some nice one-liners and you have a very watchable film in the tradition of the old Norse Sagas & a McTiernan buddy film.Incidentally there is also probably the best on-screen language transition from having to use subtitles all through the film to suddenly everyone being able to understand one another that I've ever seen. Yes it's pretty unbelievable but it makes the whole film a lot easier to watch and is quite amusing at the same time ... So don't be put off by the bewildering Greek, Arabic, Old Norse and Arabic that the film starts out with.As the man says: 'Ja være den ottende menne'",8.0,Anonymous,History
Overall this movie could have been extremely great...,The 13th Warrior was one of those movies from the beginning it starts and the story makes no sense.

And only 13 warriors can stop such an army?The revenge, however, was cool and smart and had a lot of good action. The worst thing was the last assault of the ""eaters"", when the leader of them was killed after 30 seconds! No final-fight with Banderas who learnt also to be a warrior? Apropos Banderas. Why this few scenes with the woman? She was absolutely not important and failed.In addition, if you like to see some bloody action and you are not interested in a good story, I recommend to watch the movie.

Decent entertainment,"This movie, directed by Michael Crichton and based on his novel ""Eaters of the dead"", is considered one of those quite massive mistakes that sometimes happen in the movie industry. The movie was delayed by months (maybe even years) and the test screenings were disastrous. In an effort to save what could possibly be saved the movie was cut down and released in a more or less completely altered version.What appealed to me with this movie was most of all the swinging of swords. I don't what it is with such movies, but ever since i was a kid and up until today swordplay holds a certain appeal to me. Probably that's why i've even seen the Conan-movies a few times too much... Anyway, when it comes to sword-swinging action like this movie there are two things that must be included: (1) Well-filmed fencing scenes, (2) Blood.The problem with many movies today is that the ratings-system must have gone overboard since the early 1980's when Conan got away with displaying gushing fountains of blood when people were sliced with swords and mauled with axes and hammers. There is little blood in this movie and that's of course a letdown, but a bigger letdown is the lack of decent fencing-scenes. The action-scenes are few and far between and much too short.This movie does feel like an edited version of itself. It's probably hard to salvage a movie that's been put through so much editing and re shooting as this one, so i guess the result could have been much worse. It's not nearly as awful as critics at the time made it out to be, but it's definitely flawed. Crappy writing and pale actors doesn't help the issue, and the fact that the final battles hint at a budget swiftly running dry is not to the films benefit either.The verdict? Recommended to fans of the genre i guess. If you like viking/barbarian-style action movies there is not much to choose from today (at least not much that's not child-safe). This is not a good movie, but not as bad as it could have been. I rate it 4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,History

Banderas character is chosen as the 13th warrior.What gives this movie its edge is the contrast in methods of Arab warriors and the completely different philosophy of a good horse.Plenty of swords, blood, hacking and screaming.

"A fantasy movie, with vikings","The 13th warrior is a fantasy movie based on the american author Michael Crichtons 1976 novel ""the eaters of the dead"".We follow an arab named Ahmad ibn Fadlan, who follows the ""savage"" norsemen to the exotic north. The character Ahmad is very loosely inspired by the historical character Ahmad ibn Fadlan, who travelled to the north, and reported from the life of the Volga vikings, Swedish pirates, traders and mercenaries situated in modern day Russia.The rest of the movie is a mess of native american, stone-age, iron-age, british knights tales and speculative mythology. It is quite entertaining for what it is, an old fashioned, silly adventure movie. But as a movie with any historical merits, it is abysmal.

"Thrilling adventure, great storytelling yet didn't reach it's full potential.","Right from the start, The 13th Warrior is a great movie without a doubt. Memorable characters, fantastic sets, cinematography and one of the most hard hitting soundtracks ever in a movie, but it should have been much more, as it is all over the place when it comes to editing. That though doesn't take away from the overall awesome experience you get from watching this cult classic.The inspiration for the movie - the novel ""Eaters of the Dead"" by Michael Chricton, is just as thrilling as the movie, yet the latter feels more tame and didn't expand on many things it tried to set up. We don't learn much about the warriors, which is a shame, because they all have very different personalities, and would have helped drive the narrative better. Almost none of the movie has any historically accurate stuff in it. The weapons, armor and animals are all over the place, taken from different cultures and time periods, they are all mixed up creating a pretty colorful group of fighters.Banderas really elevates his role, as he perfectly fills the shoes of the travelling arab, and the changes he goes through are belieavable, despite how rushed the plot is.

There's an amazing movie hidden here,"This movie was butchered by the studio, had an unnecessary 2nd climax tacked on, filmed by another director after John McTiernan dropped out, had 30 minutes of its runtime cut, as entirely rescored, but still remains surprisingly watchable. This alone is testament to the talent of everyone involved.John McTiernan's assured direction, beautiful photography, narrative thrust and the spirited acting of almost all actors make this a joy to watch, despite its flaws.The unknown actors portraying the Vikings all shine in their roles, each using their limited screentime to the fullest, so we get a sense of their character. The 13 warrior gives us more characterization of its twelve Vikings in 90 minutes than Peter Jackson's Dwarves received in 9 hours of Hobbit trilogy.The movie starts off as a classic adventure film, with an Arab diplomat (Antonio Banderas) joining a group of Vikings on a quest to save a northern kingdom from a mysterious threat. The scenes of Banderas bonding with the Vikings and slowly earning their respect are flawless storytelling and endear all characters to the viewer.Sadly, as the movie progresses, the studio meddling becomes more and more apparent with subplots left unresolved for no apparent reason (the intrigue, the romance) and a ridiculous 2nd climax fight added, that renders the previous climax all but pointless.Here's hoping we will one day see the original ""Eaters of the Dead"" director's cut, which I suspect is far superior to the theatrical version. In this day and age of director's cuts, this is a movie that truly deserves to be revisited. One of the criminally underrated classics of the 90s.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Lack of heroic centricism refreshing...,"13th Warrior satisfied my movie-going-cravings within: craving for an entertaining story, action at a reasonable and realistic level, and something different. Allow me to explain the latter. Unlike most action thrillers and stories set in pre-modern times, the character played by Antonio was ""not"" the central hero.  While the main character had moments of glory, he was not the one who ""saved the day."" The character's romance was not the focus, either...nor was it distracting. Lack of sexuality permitted the focus to remain on the major issue at hand: a mysterious evil that needed to be conquered. The deep and philosophical expressions throughout added an intellectual element...something usually missing from action movies. I will be adding this one to my DVD collection.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The number of warriors should have remained at twelve.,"This movie totally sucked.  I mean it was one of the worst this year.  If I wasn't with four other people, I would have left long before the movie was over.  The only redeeming quality to the movie was the graphic depictions of beheadings, and other such violence.  I almost fell asleep.  This is coming from a person who tries to find something to like in every movie, especially aggressive movies.  (Check my list all the good movies are aggressive toward something from social values to just plain tension, plus they are semi-unique.)Plot:  The reluctant dragon strikes again.  Bandaras falls in love with a shiek's mistress and then is banished.  He finds the Huns(?) and must fight with them because the 13th warrior cannot be one of them.  How stupid is that.  The beginning is very circumstantial.  How convenient that he arrives the night before the messenger for help does.  How convenient that the 13th must not be one of them.  Then they fight eaters of the dead.  They look like bears, but they ride horses, and are really people.Violence:  Awesome.  The best part of the whole movie.  It has several graphic beheadings.  I would like to make a montage of the fighting scenes, and skip the rest of the movie.  Blood spurts from necks and heads are carried off.  I sat on the edge of my seat for those parts.  My mind slept for the rest of the movie.Script:  Awful.  I have seen better dialogue written on bathroom stalls. The best lines are in the previews, and they are not even that good.  I could not believe that audacity of the film-makers to make this bad of a movie.  Plus, who would be able to pick up a whole new language without a dictionary or knowing one single word.  It is quite impossible.Acting:  As bad as the script.  I guess I should not have gone to this movie considering that Antonio has not made a good movie yet!!  Desperado was overdone, Assassins was overlong.  Everybody else was bad too.This movie was not even entertaining.  Beware, do not go see this.  You will suffer.  Anything with this many coincidences cannot be good.  Go see the Sixth Sense.  Rent a classic.

John McTiernan's worst effort ever!,"Director John McTiernan is one of my all time favorite directors. After watching Thomas Crown Affair, one of the most beautiful movies ever made, my hopes and expectations were raised even higher. This is the guy  who gave us 'Die Hard', 'Predator', and 'Hunt for Red October'. If that was not enough, Antonio Banderas, who gave a tremendously entertaining performance in 'Mask of Zorro' further convinced me that it can't be bad.I was wrong in my calculations. John  McTiernan was inspired by some of his own previous work and sort of tried to combine 'Die Hard' (in the sense these 13 guys are sort of locked up in  a village) and 'Predator'(in the sense that their are man hunters, and people who collect skulls as a tribute to some diety). However, there are so many illogical inconsistencies that whatever one or two semi-decent action  sequences this movie has, can not make up for rest of the shortcomings.When the man-hunters attack for the second time at night, could someone explain to me why they just turned back and left? Were they on some kind of synchronized clock? The point at which they decided to quit was the time when they were about to complete victory.Second, It didn't really was made clear that they were actually man-eaters, or just using skulls for some pagan ritual.In addition, the hero of the movie, the 13th warrior really does not contribute anything additional to the mission. Also what's the deal with just 13. When the other side apparently has thousands, then shouldn't everybody be putting an effort to not get eaten or avoid having their skull used for decoration purposes?In beginning of the movie Director makes the point, the man-hunters are smart, as they not only camouflage well, but hide their tracks well. Then the director shows them as complete idiots, when it comes to launching an attack (which should not be the case for those who make their living hunting and killing). There are thousands of them, and why do they decide to cross into the village at the only spot where the remaining 5 or 6 guys were defending? Even animals, predators like wolves and rest of them have enough intelligence to surround, and plan their hunt etc. On one hand they are shown so smart that they never suffered a casualty for hundreds of years that could have revealed whether they were animals or men, and on the other hand they just run themselves into blades for no apparent reason.In the end of the movie, the victory  comes in the form of killing of the evil female leader, and the strong male warrior leader. Once again its illogical to show that only those two guys were the source of inspiration for killing. After-all the plot indicates that they have been hunting for hundreds of years. That means there has been some continuity and power is inherited among them. Even in animal kingdom that happens everyday. However, according John McTiernan, those logical events do not apply here.The biggest robbery in the movie is that in the commercial it was shown he fights for love and the beautiful Arab woman in  veil is shown. In reality, there is no romance or love, which makes the whole thing even more dry. You don't get the true feeling of adventure either as the final mission turns out to be easy. They track, go in, kill the leader, and get out.A bad movie. I hope John McTiernan just turns the page over, and helps us forget about this effort.",4.0,Anonymous,History

A great film for those who love a good adventure film!,"The 13th Warrior lies somewhere in that grey region that exists between the real world and that of high fantasy. While little more than a re-telling of Beowulf, It gives us a surreal but entirely believable setting with none of the bizarre magic or monster fare common in this sort of high-adventure film. What the film lacks in exposition it more than makes up for in lush cinematography and intelligent presentation. It doesn't take itself seriously at all, and yet the comedy we do see is more everyday reality-based comedy as opposed to the one-liner, slip on a banana peel type of comedy we see in films like the Lethal Weapon series. It's the kind of movie that not all will really appreciate and many will overlook, however if you're looking for medieval fare, swords without the sorcery and dungeons without the dragons, and aren't in the mood for the political and dramatic presentation of something like Braveheart or The Messenger, than you can't go wrong with the 13th warrior.",9.0,Anonymous,History

I love a good Viking movie, this was my first encounter with that genre.I don't get the hate that it gets. You have adventure, friendship, fightscenes, some gore, some humor. It is a good and entertaining film.I wonder what it would look like with modern technology.So if you're looking for a enjoyable evening without a too heavy plot, this is it. Don't expect a masterpiece but just go in with an open mind and I'm sure you'll enjoy it if you're into action flicks. Valhala is calling.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Good, but...","Although I truly enjoyed the 13th Warrior, I felt that they left a lot of conflicts unresolved. There are a few subplots that the writers touched on that seemed to go nowhere (like with the eldest son of the king, who just seems to disappear in the film) and left no motivation as to why the Wendol were even attacking the Vikings to begin with (outside of being a potential source of food, but they could have probably fared better by attacking less fortified villages). And why, if the Wendol had not been seen in almost one hundred years, would they suddenly reappear. I have a deep feeling that the reason rumors abound that the director wanted to take his name off of the picture is that he may have shot scenes to explain some of these plot holes, but they were cut out for time constraint reasons or they slowed the action down. Outside of plot complaints, there was little else to be upset about in this film. The cinematography was beautiful, the actors were good, and the action scenes were well-staged. Antonio Banderas did not hog the scenery, and some of the secondary characters were given ample screen time to make an impression, which is rare in film nowadays. There is little in-depth character development, but there is enough that you get to feel for some of the characters and hope they live until the end. The last major battle sequence was brutal and graphic, but well-made. All in all, not a perfect film, but much better than what I was expecting given the history of the film and the rumors surrounding it. Worth seeing at least once if you liked movies like Braveheart and the old Kirk Douglas film The Vikings.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"Pretty good, could have been great","I had been expecting The 13th Warrior for a few months, since I'd first seen the trailer.  Then my eagerness lowered after I read some reviews (some were good, some were bad).  So my expectations were rattled.  I came out of the theater feeling pretty good.  At least I wasn't disappointed.  This wasn't another Godzilla.  But it wasn't Braveheart either.What I liked:  Good action sequences.  It seems that lately action films go soft when blood is needed.  Now, I've never been a big fan of gore but when you're in the middle of a battle between Vikings and cannibalistic savages I think you can't go wrong with blood and realistic depiction of violence (the head-ripping shot was cool).  The sets and photography are really impressive, made the whole movie seem cold and frightening (well, maybe I felt cold because of the freezing air-conditioning; why do they turn it up so high?).What I disliked:  I felt there could've been more.  There are many side stories that seem to want to develop but are nipped in the bud.  The first minute about why Ibn has to leave his country could've been stretched into at least 20 minutes.  This way, we could have learned more about the main character and his demons.  There could have been political intrigue, a forbidden love story, etc.  The Viking prince and Ibn's love interest seem to take us somewhere beyond the carnage and then they don't.  It's a shame.The verdict:  As far as the action movie genre goes, The 13th Warrior was good enough to fit in the category with its head up high.  But with it's lack of psychological development and burgeoning side stories it doesn't go much further.  This film could have definitely reached epic proportions (like Lawrence of Arabia and Braveheart) but for reasons previously mentioned it remains simply an action movie.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Impressive battles, not much else","What a non event!! I had a pretty good idea of what the basic plot line of this flick was, but I did expect to see a lot more battles. These, although splashed with blood and gore galore, were just too dark! It was difficult to make out who was fighting whom most of the time.Aside from the violent battles, however, the story was slow and the holes in the plot were blatantly obvious. For example - how many hillmen does it take to overwhelm a tiny little village? And where do you fit 13 horses on a Norse boat in the middle of huge seas?The story line was not very involving, I missed why the reason why the hillmen were trying to wipe out that tiny village. Plus the idea of all these warriors getting instructions from old witches who either live in the hills or in the deepest caves on earth wasn't very convincing! Surely they're not that stupid!CONCLUSION: Ending was one large cliche. I give this 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,History

"Fun...but like all other movies, have flaws","This is a movie you can watch over and over again. I just love that theme of action and history rolled into one. The action is good but blurry at times(especially in the viking lodgings).  The charachter development isnt all that well but their honour and bravery and very well displayed.  they can also be humurous without looking like a clown.  i also liked the fact that Iban wasnt portrayed as a lousy obnoxious sidekick as was done in The Mummy and such.  The ""Bad prince"" theme was totally out of the blue and shouldve been better explained but a decent attempt to add depth to the story.  the people of the town were also not well shown in a way that their plight and ideas were not well represented.  the armour and fighting was good but one of the men looked more like a spanish conquistador than a viking.  Nonetheless this movie flies by real fast and is not dull for one moment and the cinemetography as well as the soundtrack was well done.

Ignore the Nay-sayers,"I support this film for two reasons. One, McTiernan should receive kudos for excelling at his craft during the making of this film. Two, the cast of actors surrounding Banderos deserve to be noticed. Anyone unsatisfied with this film either expected too much or is overly critical due to some chemical imbalance which manifests itself in the ""I know film and this was not the 'Bicycle Thief' or 'Raging Bull' so in my miseducation of the business I will score it low and complain"" disease.This story has an even-keeled, nicely planned through line, and gives enough back story to fully color in an interesting plot. Historic, exciting, funny, and well executed this film is a great example of what good direction creates. McTiernan has used all the elements available to him (casting, art direction, editing) in high fashion. In the hands of anyone else this film would have suffered, yet McTiernan delivers a film that will survive as one of the better actioners ever.One of the most thoroughly enjoyable aspects of this film was the cast.

No more Mr. Ego,"This movie has been a real turn around for me.

From learning a new language and accepting anothers religion he took it to the max. Plus all the other warriors were twice his size, tends to put him into perspective I guess.But do not forget the other 12 Warriors, the Filthy (literally) Cannibals, the sexy mistress nor the background imagery. Buliwyf did an outstanding job in leadership to the group until the bitter but victorious end. Each of the group knew there place which was a specialty in sword fighting, tracking, and so on.

These warriors have basically been sent for to protect a village from slaughter by some unknown foe that only appears in the mist and in turn kill it (them).Even though I'm not a very big fan of Banderas (and maybe because he wasn't the center of the story), he brought a touch of comic relief that worked well with Herger the Joyous. These 2 characters are the most memorable and the ones who we get to know the most.

Beowulf done well!,"This movie was terrific. It kept true to the novel. This film should have won academy awards for Coustume Design and Cenimatography.

Along the way, Iban is revealed to Viking Customs and must change to the Vikings Climate too.What i liked: As said, it had great cinematography and great atmosphere. The action sequences were amazing. Each battle is choriapgrahed well. Great musical score and sounds. Good Story and decsent acting. Good depth in the characters.What i didn't liked: The place the movie was shot was not in Scandanavia but was shot in Canada. Didn't like the ending.

Sweeping,"This was one Michael Crichton book that I have not read but I probably will after seeing the movie. The ""13th Warrior"" is based on the Crichton book, ""Eaters of the Dead"", which in turn I believe is based on a Viking legend, and if the movie was any indication, the book must be fantastic.The story revolves around a group of Norsemen (Viking) warriors that have volunteered to a request for help from one of their neighbouring villages. Antonio Banderas' character is an ambassador from Bagdad that has come to this group of warriors to observe their culture and customs (I will let the movie describe the circumstances to his arrival). His timing couldn't have been worse as not long after he joins up with this group of warriors they recieve a request for help. As a result, 13 warriors must volunteer for this mission and by the luck of local customs, the 13th warrior cannot be of Norse decent, which means, Banderas is automatically selected to join them. The rest of the story I will let you see for yourself.The cinematography is absolutely wonderful. The sweeping shots of the land show the ruggedness and mystery of the country and in some cases it feels somewhat like a documentary, which adds to the realism of the story. The beginning of the movie starts out with much of the dialogue spoken in the Norsemen's native language with no subtitles. What is spoken is not of great importance as what you're supposed to observe is the cultural interactions between the warriors. But as Banderas' character is slowly integrated into the plot, the director chooses an absolutely wonderful way of making the transition from the native tongue to english. To me, this was definately one of the creative highlights of the movie. This is one film where I have to stress that the dialogue is very good. I found that every line spoken was of significance to the story and often revealed insight into what the main characters were thinking and feeling.Although Antonio Banderas was billed as the lead actor, he did not dominate the movie. In fact, his charactor had more of a supporting role that was there to document the mission. The movie did a very good job of focusing around the warriors as a group and gave enough attention to each of the main characters to allow the audience to gain an insight into their personalities. The acting was very good. Every character was played very well and definately created an authenticity to them.There is quite a bit of graphic violence so if you are the ""faint of heart"" type, you might want to consider a different movie. Despite many of the positives that I've mentioned there are some points that should be noted. This movie does have a religious tone to it so if you are a religious person, keep in mind that you are watching a movie about another culture's take on religion. Also keep in mind that this story is based on a folklore/legend, which means that not everything is going to make sense. Most of the story does but there are things that don't lend itself to logic but if you pick every little thing out, you will end up ruining the movie. Also, there are some parts of the battle scenes that take place in very dim lighting which make it hard to see but I have a feeling this was done on purpose to add realism.Overall, I found this to be a very gripping and entertaining movie. I also think that ""Eaters of the Dead"" would have been a more intriguing title....9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,History
romantic epic,"I would think it would be difficult to upstage Antonio Banderas -- he is usually the upstager, as Armand in ""INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE"" in which Banderas upstaged Brad Pitt.  In 13th Warrior, Banderas is upstaged by Vladimir Kulich or at least, I would call it a close draw.  Kulich makes most other men look somewhat effeminate -- he really is a magnificent specimen of a male.  His acting, in this movie at least, is insightful, focused, cool.  He's so cool he even has ""kul"" in his name.  I really did like this movie.  But then I like costumes and manners and locales. Bloody stuff -- I have to look away during some scenes, especially if I am having any meal but nevertheless, the scenes melt together with a dreamlike quality and it's almost believable.  There seemed to be some editing bleeps -- how did all those horses get onto that tiny ship and where were they?  Below decks?  But this is trivial.  Could this be true?

At Last Hollywood does justice to the Norse,"Hollywood takes another chop at making a Viking epic. Will the 13th Warrior be the `Braveheart' of Viking epics?

Originally entitled `Eaters of the Dead' and adapted from the Michael Crichton novel, this film has taken one and a half years to get to our local multiplex. Rumors of a $150 million plus budget and numerous scenes being reshot, I was beginning to wonder if this film would ever surface. Director John McTiernan was extremely upset with the film and the studio pulling the plug pre-emptly. There are reports that the studio pulled the plug then asked the angered director to reshoot the ending and various fight scenes. Let's just say this film was a behind the scenes mess. What's so incredibly amazing is this film overcomes the plagued behind the scenes mess. The sweeping Viking mists, the longboat overcoming thirty foot waves, blood thirsty battle, and scenic highlands are just some of the mystique that have enchanted our minds on the views of Viking lore. What's really rich and never been done in Hollywood is the thought of an outsider entering this mystical world and letting us see it through his eyes. Banderas' Muslim outsider is kind, sensitive and passionate until he becomes embroiled in the honor of being a man of the North. He is among very few Hollywood heroes who are disturbed by the blood and gore associated with Viking civilization. But when he finds that the `unnamed' evil is only a man, his anger engulfs him and he begins to see a new vision of what man is. This is an epic in the greatest sense of the word. The only ever evident flaw in this film is the ending itself. Why is it so short? Why is the climax not on a major scale? I know the symbolism associated with Vikings dying in battle and why didn't they take that to next level? The ending is only about 3 minutes when we should have been in the 10-20 minute range. On a positive note, this is the first Hollywood venture I have ever seen that takes Vikings seriously and I have wanted to see something in that nature all my life. I just hope because of all its problems they don't stop making Viking films. Previous Viking films have been on less than 10 million dollar budgets and looked like men dueling in woolen overalls. Anybody out there remember `Lee Majors' in `The Vikings' or `Tim Robbins' in the funny `Erik the Viking'? Well these were about the only Viking staples until `The 13th Warrior'. So go out and see this epic but when its done think what it would have been like if the final war scenes were 10 minutes longer. I hope Hollywood can hear me.

A good action film set in the Dark Ages,"The movie is based on Michael Crichton's book, the Eaters of the Dead.  I had found the book interesting, but had forgotten about it years ago until I was about fifteen minutes into the 13th Warrior.  I found the movie to be more in depth, and more exciting.  I did have some problems trying to believe an Arab using a Spanish accent, and I also could not fathom how so many of the bear-cult followers could remain secret for long (their procession of torches stretched for miles - The Gold Dragon), nor how they could not just overwhelm the Northmen.  Otherwise, I had a lot of fun watching it.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Stunning!,"At first, one wonders will this story ever get off the ground. But once it does it moves with effortless grace.

Now, I haven't read the Crichton book upon which this movie was based, so I can't judge it by whether or not it was true to the novel... but I do know that this was quite a unique film (which, of course, is probably why a lot of people didn't like it). It was one of the few recent action movies that actually made me care about the characters in it.

Underrated... Why?????????!!!!,"I had read Michael Crichton's ""Eaters of the Dead"" based on the chronicles of an Arab called Ibn Fadhlan around 1100 AD. Despite the overwhelming critics, the film IS a very good adaptation of the novel. Also, the novel itself, happens to be an adaptation of the Beowulf Saga, with some nice insights in the lifestyle and beliefs of the ancient Norsemen. There is a very nice musical soundtrack, and beautiful, fitting scenery throughout the movie. Maybe the accents, and dressing of the Vikings strike as unrealistic, but this is not the first time such a thing happens, not is it a reason to blame the film (remind you of ""Gladiator""). The brave, laughing spirit of the valiant Norsemen, kept me awed throughout the film, with a very remarkable show of bravery by their leader Buliwyf in the end. The film hasn't changed many things from Michael Crichton's novel, and I would suggest reading the novel first before bursting into negative comments about it. Neither did I find the film ""empty"" in dialogue, nor did I get the feeling that I didn't grasp some part of the scenario. There is action throughout the film, nice battle scenes, and an adventurous spirit with a touch of the Norse valor in more than a few occasions. An overall good film, that may have been better, only if it had been longer, and maybe given us more depth into the characters of the 12 brave Norsemen who were chosen to face such monstrous opponents that remind us of Grendel from the Beowulf Saga.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A faithful adaptation to the novel.,"I've read the novel, Eaters of the Dead, by Crichton and this movie, 13th Warrior, is an extremely faithful translation of the novel. This movie had a bold, sweeping musical score and beautiful cinematography.This movie has been bashed by critics, but these same critics seem to have not read to novel because the criticisms they made should be directed at the book instead. This movie and the novel were both based on an ancient Nordic poem called, Beowulf. The novel itself was written in a journal or chronicle format, which is why some plot holes and lack of character build up is present. Overall, this film gives a refreshing perspective on both, the legendary poem and the novel.The film is extremely enjoyable and it contains a solid ending, which, in my opinion, is the heart of both, this movie and the novel. Anyone who enjoys action and archaic, Period films of warriors and heros will love this film. If you've read the novel and enjoyed it, you will definitely love this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Not ashamed to say I enjoyed it,"I can't understand why people were so down on this movie. It found its way onto more than a few Worst of the Year lists and was generally ignored by the public.I enjoyed Crichton's book and the movie was quite faithful to it. Some parts regarding the eaters of the dead were a little silly, but hey, no more so than most of the stuff we're expected to buy from any other movie.On the whole, it was genuinely funny and the sword-fighting action quality was a treat after countless Hercules cheese-fests. I was also totally satisfied with the way the movie handled the language problem. Although I wondered how Antonio learned the viking word for ""grape,"" once again, a little suspension of disbelief goes a long way.

This movie doesn't have much of a plot or story, but c'mon....when it gets down to it, any movie with lots of blood and action doesn't really (Starship Troopers).

A potentially great film.,"This was a film that I enjoyed watching again and again.  However, there were gaps in the storyline that were not explained entirely.  Almost as if some scenes had been cut out.  For example, the history behind the Wendol, or the background on the King's Son Wigliff and his dead brothers vs. Buliwyf, or why the movie ended so abruptly.  Although this was based on a book, this movie had a lot of potential of being more than a good film. The humor, the action, the cinematography all went really well.  It showed how barbarian (in a good sense) the Northmen/Viking types were.  I have and will recommend this to others.",9.0,Anonymous,History

There was action, costumes, *gorgeous* vikings, and great ""atmosphere"" throughout the entire show!! Not a one of us thought afterward that there had been a dull moment the whole time!! The story was terrific, the sets were awesome, and the battles were exciting! I have read the book twice, and I thought this movie did a really FINE job of attempting to stay pretty close to it!

Pretty Fine Movie,"Considering we're a society that supposedly loves violence and gore, there are very few really good, solid action-adventure flicks. The 13th Warrior is one such rare beast.The movie's exciting, unpretentious, and effective, though the introductory sequences are a bit rushed. After that, the movie settles down; the fight scenes are dramatic, well-staged, and in no way gratuitous (though anyone under 13 is guaranteed nightmares). There are some really cool sequences involving language and weaponry, though and the interaction between the Arab (Antonio Banderas) and Norse (Everybody else) cultures are pretty neat.Banderas is the only advertised star and eponymous 13th Warrior, but he doesn't dominate the plot and screen to the detriment of the film; rather, virtually all of the 13 warriors are permitted to develop as characters, to some degree. They all act pretty well, a rarity in movies in general and especially with this genre. It's especially fun to watch Banderas's character develop as the film progresses.In addition to the strong support for Banderas, the setting really enhances the movie. Beautiful forested settings, a dose of Norse culture, and some great scenery shots are very effective.The 13th Warrior is pure action, though; there's no heavyhanded message, attempt to be politically correct, or apparent ulterior motive. The action is fast, the men are masculine, and the bad guys are pure evil.The movie has a few flaws, but they're not much of an issue. One or two plot lines are undeveloped, and some of the events and last-minute escapes are a bit improbable. However, anyone watching the movie will soon forget such issues; the movie really draws one in.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Heroic stuff,"Perhaps one special feature about the movie which I seldom come across in other Hollywood-produced movies is the fact that it gives a good light about Islam, and in a rather casual and a-matter-of-fact way too. Being a Muslim myself, when I realised that Banderas was a Muslim in the story, and being the main character too, I was bracing myself for some inaccurate and bias portrayal of the religion. Well, apart from some forgiveable inaccuracies, it did not materialise at all.The highest point in the movie for me is the final battle between the warriors and the baddies towards the end of the movie. It is moving to see Banderas's character praying to God for victory before the final battle. Makes me realise how much human these days forget to do the same whilst in the same seemingly hopeless position. And Buliwyf too. As he went into the battleground, probably half dead from poisoning, I felt like running into the screen and join the battle with him. Pure heroic stuff.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A magnificent attempt amongst a handful of films ever made on the subject of Muslim Heroes,This out standing piece of work is one of the very few films that picture a Muslim in a Positive role where in the current day media Muslims are depicted only as religious fanatics or refugees. One should also wonder why not many or any films at all are made but countless films are made to glorify the deeds of the American army when what ever they do is justified for good only. But the story also lacks true historic representations when Spain was the thriving city in the west while the rest of Europe were in the Dark ages.,10.0,Anonymous,History
brutal medieval warfare = good,"I liked this movie.  I found it thoroughly enjoyable.  It wasn't perfect, but I thought it was very exciting and intense.

Who needs guns for action,"I watched this film because it seemed different. Apart from Antonio Banderas, the rest of the cast to me were unknowns. Before I continue I must say now... JOHN MCTIERNAN is one of the greatest action directors... PERIOD!!! The film makes you feel like you're in the Viking time period. You don't have to imagine much as the film does that for you with great depth of characters and scenery. The fight sequences are gory, but required. I loved the performances of the Norsemen mostly. The story is simple and effective and the film is not overlong. I really hope they make a sequel as I don't believe that there are enough 'GOOD' films made for that time period. If you have not seen this film do yourself a favour and rent it or even buy it. I guarentee you will not be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,History
I'll pray the Viking Gods...,"Even amputated, the 13th Warrior is one of the greatest films of John McTiernan, and in my opinion the best adventure movie of the last decade.

Vladimir Kulich's performance is fantastic, he made me think of a modern , noble figure of Conan the Barbarian. I loved too this fabulous score. Jerry Goldsmith is a musical genius. What can I say more ? The epic battles, the Vikings, the photography... It's perfect ! I think I'll pray Thor and Odin for a Director's Cut Edition of this great Nordic adventure.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Enjoyable Movie,"This was truly an enjoyable movie.  I have read the book 'Eaters of the Dead' and although Crichton is and alway will be a brilliant writer, I think that this was one of his earlier work and it lacks the 'spirit' that his later novels had.  However, with what they had to translate, from the book to the movie, I think they did a brilliant job - more so than his other 'block buster' move from book such as Jurassic Park and Lost world - which in my opnion was pretty FAR from what his novels was about. Lacking the big name actors, super special effects that most movies nowaday uses to pull in crowd and real corny pathetic punch lines that would have landed you in jail if you really did that in real life - this movie was able to stick to what needs to be done, do it and move on. The other thing that I found refreshing was the understanding by the director/producer that a 'movie' is only a SNAP shot into a time-line. Understandably, there will be reference to some deed done in the past that in my opnion, if it wasn't tooo complicated, you should not need to explain it (ie, the comment about the king's son killing his brother).  It gives the movie a much more realistic on-going of the world instead of  pausing here and there for explanation that really would not have been realistic. The fighting was fantastic, realistic without trying to glorify something that is morbid and messy.  Vikings fight with brute force, there's no snappy flashy Kung-fu sword moves.  The difference in youthful brute strength and experience old timer was clearly seen when the blondish Viking challenge and killed off the red-head giant.  The style of viking fight was further shown in the close combat first fight with the 'Eaters of the death'.  In the situation where the 'demons' were trying to win by piling and piling in with bodies, I fail to see how a 'wide angle' shot of the fight scene could have been preferred to a 'feel' of close-up, body, fur and steel. Without saying more, this is a brilliant movie for those who still enjoy a movie without the special effect and big names actors. I have to say that Vladimir, the leader of the viking, was BRILLIANT! - I have NEVER ever seen anyone that commanded such a big screen presence as he did and potray such a regal presence. And the armors with all the nordic crosses and symbols. *drool* Rating : 10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,History
A surprise,"Yet again Antonio Banderas has surprised me. I've seen him in many films, and it was first in EVITA that I realised he could act. Little did I know how versatile he was. 13th warrior really displayed his talent, and it allowed him to stretch himself to many levels.I wasn't originally interested in seeing this movie. My husband and I purchased a used copy because it was only $5. Turned out to be a great investment. The story of good versus evil is quite old, but this movie really takes it to it's limits in a clever and absorbing way. With many interesting characters and action scene after action scene, you are drawn in from the get go.The part of the movie that I was incredibly impressed with was when Ahmed (Antonio) was sitting at the fire with the band of Vikings. Over the course of the following minutes, the Norsemen's language slowly turned into understandable words. It was incredibly well directed and filmed with really cool screen shots.Anyhow, if you're up for a fun time with a little mystery and lots of action, pick this one up. It's available as a library rental at any video store, and it's definitely worth the 4.50 you'd pay.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Very good Movie,"To really appreciate this movie, I think you need to read the book (Eaters of the Dead by Michael Crichton). The book is written telling the story of the deeds of Ibn and his Viking buddies. Fortunately the movie followed the book almost word for word and scene for scene. The depictions in the book were realized in the movie, which is not always the case. Some might say there was very little dialog thus little story but they missed the whole point. This story is gives us a unique look into what life must have been like without a large government supporting us. Where the difference between life and death is in  our own hands. This was a very basic movie about comrades in arms and the acceptance of an outsider into the brotherhood of the organization. It was about base things of life that don't need a fancy dialog to receive you receive it directly to the gut.

Extremely Underrated Action Adventure Film,"Many will most likely not come across this film or this review as it is from the late 90s and surprisingly flopped at the box office, but it is a must watch if you action, adventure, or historical fiction of any kind. Although this movie is loosely based on the real accounts of a Persian diplomat during the Islamic Golden Age, it molds historical accuracy with fiction perfectly.The characters are interesting, diverse in their manner, and all look the part. Banderas plays his role very well. The costumes, soundtrack, and filming locations are all great. Although it is not a perfect movie, I still felt I needed to rate it as a 10/10 because this film is loads better than any of the filth released these days.

A Mythic retelling of Beowulf. Cool!!!,"The 13th Warrior is mythic, compelling, powerful and moving--a cross between Beowulf and the Seven Samurai. I found it violent, yes, which is hard for me because I am a very tender-hearted viewer. (Jane Austen is more my usual fare.) A second viewing was worth the time. It let me see the scenes I couldn't watch the first time, and gave me greater appreciation for the myth and saga of it all. It has a fresh perspective, spare narrative, excellent performances and crisp pacing. The designers did a vivid job of creating mysterious, distant cultures. Hollywood movies are not used to cold, mist, mud, pine forests and giant blonde and red-haired pagans--I relished the look of the film. I loved the development of the Northman--from strange raw brutes to courageous, noble warriors and friends. The movie is uncompromising in its depiction of Viking life. A gem of a film.

"Thoroughly entertaining, Well written, Well crafted piece","I would have loved to have seen a director's cut, as I suspect that much of this story remains in the editor's room floor in the pursuit of the 90 minute film. I could be wrong, perhaps this movie *is* the intent of the film makers, but as engaging as the story is, it feels like some scenes that should be there are not there. In any case, I was enchanted by Antonio Banderas' performance - subtle but yet emotionally charged. I was pleasantly surprised to see one of my favorite actors, Omar Sharif appear (though sadly I suspect that some of his material was cut too).Also, for once Muslim characters were portrayed humanely and intelligently, unlike the usual fanatical stereotype we see so often (and the starring role too!). An interesting look at Nordic culture was also a pleasure.Even with these shortcomings I rated this film highly and recommend it without hesitation.",8.0,Anonymous,History
An Introduction to Literature,"After reading many of the other comments, I would like to share an opinion from another viewpoint.  I have watched this film on the big screen about five times now.  Each time picking out more of the in-depth work that was done on the historic viewpoint.  It was my introduction to the Beowulf Saga.After the movie, I read the book (I prefer to do it that way and learn the background of the story instead of watching for some favorite scene that didn't make it all the way through) and learned so much about Michael Crichton's effort in explaining an epic poem in realistic terms.  Then I read several other books on the epic, including one prose version of the tale mixing realism and Nordic myth.  All added to my further enjoyment of the film's storytelling.Further research lead to explanations as to why things could have happened as the film depicted.  The ""Venus"" effigies used by the ""Wendel"" were common to the CroMagnon people.  It was highly likely that a pocket civilization might exist in the mid-900s.  The sole survivor of one attack listed it as a ""very old hate"".The armour of the Vikings was unique.  It is very possible that they would each have their own favorite pieces which they had procured one way or another in their travels.  Each one was a specialist in his own way.I enjoyed the film thoroughly, obviously.  I look forward to the release of the VHS and DVD editions.  From further reading, I understand that there was much unused footage.  A director's cut would be a welcome addition to my collection.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Favorable Review,"I wish I was William Shakespeare because only he could say this right. There are some movies which tell a simple story and do it so well that you even after you've seen it you still seem to hold a piece of it with you. This was the effect the 13th Warrior had on me.  Having not read the book, I had no idea what this film was about.  I liked the premise: a group of people get together to defeat and evil presence which threatens the lives of an entire kingdom.  This group stands up to the challenge and fights a truly wonderful battle.  Full of mesmerizing scenery, wonderful costuming and truly amazing actors, this film was like reading a story using subtle images to express a very deep emotion.  I found this film to be of great satisfaction.  I compare it to Braveheart and Henry V (Mr.Brannaugh's version) and if you liked either of these please see the 13th Warrior.  It is a Viking gem, expressing how accepting Vikings were and are as a culture. I look forward to the DVD release.  This is surely a film I will be adding to my collection.",10.0,Anonymous,History
This film deserves a second chance.,"A difficult film to fully appreciate the first time around because of its poor editing, it nevertheless deserves multiple viewings.  The story has two unique elements that alone make it worth watching: a handsome Muslim hero, and a cast of historically accurate Aryan warriors as his friends.  These two things of course being an extreme rarity in that the concept of either Muslim or Aryan warriors as good-guy heroes seems to go against the dictums of Hollywood.  The film's best attribute however, is that if you search beneath the surface it actually has some interesting things to say about the power of language and especially the written word as it relates to the remembrance of greatness.  Thereby, in a clever way, also making a commentary on the film medium itself as scripts are chosen or rejected by Hollywood, not for quality, but for what perspectives of greatness are deemed worthy of remembrance (and exploitation) and what perspectives should be censored and forgotten.",9.0,Anonymous,History
see this movie again,"I saw this in the movie theater when it first came out and I grudgingly liked it (because of Antonio). Lately, its been showing a lot on the movie channels and the more I see it, the more I appreciate what they've done in this movie. Rarely a movie gets better with multiple viewings, but this one does. The cinematography is great in capturing the beauty of the virgin forests and the claustrophobic darkness of having to live by firelight. They really give you a sense of what life must have been like at that time. Storywise, I love how none of the warriors are spared. Which when you think about it, makes perfect sense. Antonio is wonderful bringing a lot of comic relief to the movie. For a leading man, he thankfully doesn't hog the spotlight. And the bad guys remain superhuman and creepy. So to anyone who didn't like it the first time, I recommend seeing this movie again. It's on enough and even with fifty million channels, sometimes it's the best thing on tv.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Old story reworked,"Good story, plenty of action. The Oracle is very ""Yoda-ish"", in her speech. Antonio Banderas was excellent, as were the other actors (male & female). I especially liked the way the director tackled the language change from norse to english, and did not use subtitles. Definately one for my collection. The comments of Muhammed Arrabi are well worth a look(another imdb member). I was surprised that our local UCI did not show this film, and that the Odeon only put it on twice a day. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,History
The Vikings were very courageous.,"John McTiernan has the reputation of making action-movies, remember ""Predator (1987)"" and ""Hunt for Red October, The (1990)"".  One  can hardly say, apart from the intermission of the poet Ibn Fahdlan (a stupid Antonio Banderas in one of his worst parts ever), that this movie is not historically correct.  Neanderthalers on horses, it is just possible. Cannibals in the Nordic Fjords adoring bears, it is also possible.  One doubts if the Arab poet Ibn Fahdlan is still politically correct nowadays (the movie was made in 1999).  The Nordic fighters (for the greatest part Norwegian actors), who in this movie are really afraid of nothing, are indeed (politically correct).",8.0,Anonymous,History
Better than it looks,"When I saw the previews for this movie, i thought it was going to be a real piece of c***. Then I read somewhere that it was very gory and bloody and violent, so i decided to go see it. I like blood and gore and violence. But when I saw it, i really liked it. It was pretty gory, but there was a decent story, and i liked Antonio Banderas' name in this one. it takes like 45 seconds to pronounce. go see it with some friends. Highly recommended, although it may be more of a guy movie.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Now Read the Book,"Having read ""Eaters of the Dead"" (now being marketed as the 13th Warrior for continuity sake) I was very pleased with how well the film was adapted.  The story line is explained in far more detail (of course) and the fact that Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan is in fact a real historical figure is one of the most fascinating aspects of the book.Despite the fact that Antonio Banderas cannot escape his Spanish accent (making him a very unique Arab) I found the film fascinating.  The only drawback for me was the fact that I know intimately the area where they filmed it, loosing a little of the romance of it for me.The whole thing was a very satisfying adaptation of a fascinating story.  If you enjoy the film, read the book, if you liked the book, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the film.All in all a good film.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A great film!,"I thought ""The 13th Warrior"" was a fabulous film!  The characters were all very interesting, and well done.  There were a number of scenes that I thought were just brilliantly directed.  For instance, when the Antonio Banderas character is learning the Northmen Language.The story is nothing terribly complicated, it can basically be summed up to: A guy is banished from his home and then ends up with a bunch of Northmen. He is then chosen by an oracle-like person to go on a quest with 12 other warriors to help some friends of the Northmen, who have requested help from the Northmen.  So, of course they all go to help them out.The only problem I have with the story is why the Antonio Banderas character actually decides to help them.  There is virtually nothing in it for him, but he goes with them anyway.  It would be nice to have some explanation, but I can deal without it.I thought this was a very entertaining movie and I thought it was an interesting story.  I would recommend watching this film if you haven't seen it already (if this sound like a film you'd be interested in seeing).  I hope you enjoy the film as much as I do.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",10.0,Anonymous,History
Beowulf,"If you are aware of history (not the recent stuff of the last 1000 years), ancient literature (Beowulf), Norsemen Sagas and genetic memories you will like this film very much.   If you are brain dead and only want a hack and slash, you won't.  This is a great film of a very old story, retold by a master story teller. Beware the grendel's mother...",8.0,Anonymous,History
A solid epic...,"This is not a film that will appeal to everybody.  That has to be said first.  It is not because of acting; in fact, if you look, you'll see that there is some fairly good acting by the principles (who have all the screen time, so the bit parts don't really come out).  It is not because of the effects; the effects are actually quite good.  It is because this sort of story has never, to my knowledge, been told on the screen (and yes, I have seen Conan).The 13th Warrior is a proper Norse/Germanic epic.  It is filled with larger-than-life heroes, horrifying monsters, and lots of battle and glory. There is very little in the way of romantic interest, which is not surprising in the least.  The film is based on Michael Crichton's Eaters of the Dead, which is in turn based on Beowulf.And as a rendition of Beowulf, it is very well done.  Some vast liberties have been taken with the plot, but the spirit of the poem remains.  The story is told through the eyes of an Arab traveller (Antonio Banderas) who voyages to Hrothgar's hall of Heorot with twelve Vikings led by Buliwif, the son of Hygelac.  There they encounter the Wendel, bear-like monsters who are said to eat the bodies of the dead, and they battle both inside and outside of the hall.If I have any criticism of the film, it is that at times the battle scenes are so crowded that it is very difficult to keep track of what is going on. However, if you are a fan of Beowulf and Norse/Germanic epic, then this is a must see.  If not, then this will be a new and hopefully enjoyable experience.  One warning, however: it is quite gory.  4.5/5",9.0,Anonymous,History

The Valhalla of Eyecandy,"""The 13th Warrior"" is not a perfect movie -- it starts off a bit slow and some of the plot elements are just too far-fetched, even for the genre -- but I found it far more entertaining and suspenseful than a lot of other movies out this summer that got inexplicably better reviews.There's *plenty* of action (although the battle scenes are not nearly as well choreographed as, say ""Braveheart"") and some fun surprises, but what I liked best about the flick is that for once, it's the guys and not the babes who are the eyecandy! A lot of handsome, hardy Vikings doing manly things makes it easy to forgive the film's faults. Oh yeah... some guy named Antonio is in it. Eh, who cares. Did I mention the Vikings?",9.0,Anonymous,History

Limb-fest 2000!!!,"This had to be one of THE most violent films of all time!(not that that is necessarily bad!) And whats really cool is that there is actually a pretty decent story behind this extremely cool viking warrior movie.  It's sort of a retelling of the classic poem Beowulf, but instead of Grendel (the big evil monster in Beowuf) there's this army of brutal savages who are believed to be demons.  Antonio Banderas (desperado) enters the movie as an arabian poet kicked out of his village because he liked this lady. So he winds up in the Norse land (huh?) and winds up helping the villagers to fight the evil creatures. I know that doesn't really sound very interesting but trust me, it's cool(hey, if i told you the whole story it would ruin it).  So, if you like Banderas, swords, carnage, and vikings, i HIGHLY reccomend this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent performance of Antonio Banderas,"I have given this movie 9 out of 10 points. If it had been longer, I would have given it 10. It seems like it has been cut too short. I give Antonio Banderas 10 out of 10 for his performance. I think that he is one of the most talented actors, that we have for the moment",9.0,Anonymous,History
Why all the negative press?,"This was an entertaining film from start to finish.  The acting was fine, the scenery good, and action dynamite (and you will not see any ""flubs"" in the fight scenes).  In my opinion, it is well worth the full price of movie admission, and I'll probably see it again. The plot isn't bad, it is just uncomplicated;  13 warriors go to the aid of another group, bada bing, bada boom.  I highly recommend this movie, especially if you like the genre. Enjoy!",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Underrated ""GEM"" with too many naysayers!!!!!!","First off the source material alone is worth reading, that being said this film is a cult classic of the 1st Grade, the pacing kept my attention, the culture clashing was well written and fleshed out, the 13 Warriors came up against a adversary they've never encounter, ingenuity, skills & strength push this adventure for me, if you're looking for OSCAR or BAFTA performances from this film it's not for you, pure adventure from a bygone ERA. Antonio Banderas played his character well as did his costars, I would like to see this fleshed out on a streaming services as a miniseries too truly capture ""Eater's Of The Dead"" main character journey, just my opinion.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Rock solid adventure movie of epic scale,"Would anybody have complained about this movie in case its complicated production history would not have become public knowledge at the time of its belated release? Fact is ""The 13th Warrior"" works. And if there ever was an adult boy´s own film, this is it. The direction (whether by McTiernan or Crichton) knows how to handle adventure and the grim photography reminds one at the same moment that these were hard times for anyone around. All the actors, even Banderas, are perfect. And if you see this film on the big screen, you get lost in its time and space. One of the most underrated movies of the nineties and unjustly so.",8.0,Anonymous,History
The Best Action Movie of 1999 and the Best Viking Movie Ever,"This film got very mixed reviews when it was released - I saw some critics give it the highest marks while others trashed it as, in their opinions, one of the worst films of the year.  I personally agree with the critics who liked this film and think its the best movie ever made about the Vikings (although there, unfortunately, aren't many other Viking films for comparison) and I think it will grow in popularity over time like other unique films that initially failed with critics and at the box office (like ""Blade Runner"").  This is a pure testosterone movie that tells, through the eyes of an Arabian poet, the story of Vikings fighting against a mysterious and cannibalistic tribe.  Based on an older Michael Crichton novel called ""The Eaters of the Dead,"" this movie takes itself seriously - no wisecracking sidekicks or other dumb movie cliches are to be found here (which, inexplicably, was something the critics who hated the movie complained about - I guess they prefer every action/adventure movie to be campy and tongue-in-cheek like ""Congo"" or ""The Mummy"").  And, by taking itself seriously, the nobility of the Vikings and their code of honor comes through strongly by the end of the film.  If I had to criticize anything in the film, its that the battle scenes are too dark and hard-to-see.  While I greatly admire naturally-lit films, and these scenes do capture what a fight in the dark of night without artificial lighting would be like, I think they should have bend a bit towards standard movie convention and used more lighting in these scenes.  Still, despite that complaint, this is the best action film of 1999 and it is definitely worth a look (8/10 stars).",8.0,Anonymous,History
Fabulous cinematography and stirring soundtrack,"The previews spoke of mystery, magic, and other-worldly settings; my interest was peaked. I picked up the book and flew through it. I couldn't wait for the movie. But I couldn't really see how some of the plot elements would be handled and Antonio Banderas playing an Arab diplomat turned warrior. I was rather astounded by the outcome. The 13th Warrior, while not destined for Best Picture, was stunning in it's imagery and sound. Both things drove me to feel the bravery and courage of the warriors set out to battle ""the thing which cannot be named."" The plot is a little confusing (having read the book first, I followed better than the others in the theater) but it mirrors the confusion felt by Ibn who is thrown into a world where he doesn't speak the language and doesn't know what he has been chosen to do. It's a great action movie with a hint of mystery and magic that's definitely meant to be seen in a theater to get the full effect of your surroundings. Try to catch an off hour showing as some of the dialogue is hard to catch with lots of other ""people"" noise surrounding you.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Surprisingly good for a Crichton movie.,"I was lucky going into this movie that I hadn't been told anything about it. Most critics predicted a bomb, I believe.  Certainly I wouldn't have bothered if I had known it was directed and written by Michael Crichton, creator of such ""gems"" as Congo. The more I watched, the more I loved this movie.  It has all the elements of a wonderful action flick, great historical themes (such as the Viking horses vs. the Arabian), and surprising originality.  It actually contributed new material to the genre of historical fiction, not to mention having darned fine fight scenes.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A great epic retelling of a classic story,"Having waited some time to see this long-delayed screen version of Michael crichton's ""Eaters of the Dead"" I went into the theater with a few reservations about how this film would turn out.  Two hours later, I left the theater exhilerated by one of the best and most surprisingly intelligent action films since THE MATRIX. The 13th WARRIOR is an excellent addition to a sadly underused genre, the period epic actioner.  Not since BRAVEHEART has a film included such large scale exhilerating combat sequences, skillfully directed by action auteur John McTiernan.  While many may not believe that this as good a film as DIE HARD or HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, I strongly believe that in terms of direction alone, this is McTiernan's crowning achievement.Amazing action sequences aside, the intelligence in this film lies within its roots.  The film is essentially a retelling of the classic epic ""Beowulf.""  Instead of the valiant knight Beowulf, you have thirteen valiant warriors.  Instead of Grendel, you have a huge clan of mysterious cannabalistic creatures.  The same questions surrounding Grendel apply to them.  Are they animal or man?  Or perhaps something even worse?  Having knowledge of the Beowulf epic does enhance the film, as the story has some holes you may not understand if you are not familiar with the epic.  The same may hold true for the book, which I have not yet read, but very well may after seeing this film.   The film also includes another great action performance by Antonio Banderas to add to his exciting turn in MASK OF ZORRO.  It also includes a supporting cast who should be commended for endowing their roles with such character even with only a few lines of dialogue. Overall, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies like Mel Gibson's BRAVEHEART or John Boorman's EXCALIBUR, which I also recommend to anyone who has not seen it and enjoys this genre.  I highly recommend to those who enjoy this film that they track down a translation of BEOWULF and enjoy the epic poem from which this high-powered film is derived.",9.0,Anonymous,History
