A really great comic book adaptation,"""With great power comes great responsibility"".These words, spoken by Peter Parker's uncle Ben(Cliff Robertson)during their last conversation and which have become Spider-Man's motto, also perfectly represent the challenge Sam Raimi was facing when asked to bring one of America's most loved superheroes to the screen.You can relax, fellas: Raimi's movie is definitely worth a look.Loosely based on the origin story and the Stan Lee/John Romita Sr. run, it's a fascinating mix of spectacular action and powerful drama, as it chronicles Peter Parker's(Tobey Maguire) transformation into a superhuman and the responsibilities deriving from said metamorphosis: while fighting crime to avenge his uncle's death, he also has to deal with his feelings for Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst) and his friendship with Harry Osborn(James Franco); add Harry's father Norman(Willem Dafoe), who's become schizophrenic psycho Green Goblin, and you've got a quite complicated situation.Raimi's excellent at showing us the hero's pain, as well as the one he causes to others, and he gets terrific performances from the entire cast, particularly Maguire, Dafoe and Robertson.On its own, it's a very good superhero flick, alongside the sequel, it's an absolute masterpiece.Recommended even if you don't care about the comics.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Definitely exceeded my expectations!,"I am not into action films particularly,(I'm 17) but this was a really pleasant surprise. This is a well-designed, well-acted and well-directed film, that is close to the comics, which my younger brother used to collect. I loved the music score by Danny Elfman, very like Batman. The special effects were excellent, especially with the scene on the bridge, and the direction from Sam Raimi was fast-paced and secure. But for me, the acting was the best aspect of the movie. Tobey Maguire was the biggest surprise. Usually actors playing comic book heroes are bland, but Maguire was not that at all. If anything he was very charming. Kirsten Dunst portrays the thankless role of the damsel in distress, and I must say, she is very impressive. J.K Simmons gets the most laughs as Jameson, but the best actor was Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn aka the Green Goblin. He not only looked the part of the Green Goblin, but brought some welcome gravitas to the role. The story is sweet and sometimes poignant towards the beginning, though the only real complaints I have of this movie is that the script at times is a little uneven, and the film is a bit long. All in all, a satisfying take on the comic book hero. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spider-Man (2002) - With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility!,"Considered as one of the most successful superhero movies ever made, ""Spider-Man"" is a superhero film adaptation of one of Stan Lee's most popular Marvel comics, and becoming one of the first movies to score the highest opening weekend in the box office. There's no wonder, because this is an exciting and enjoyable motion picture. One of my childhood favorites, to be exact! This movie tells the origin story of Peter Parker, or Spider-Man, portrayed by Tobey Maguire, whom after being bit by a radioactive spider, he has gained extraordinary powers to climb walls, shoot web, and beat bad guys. But all that must be put to the test when Parker has to defeat one of the first villains of the Spider-Man universe, the Green Goblin, portrayed by Willem Dafoe. Although Maguire is somewhat bland in a few of his movies, I respected that he fit the role of Peter Parker perfectly, playing a shy kid, with no powers to either beat the bad guy or win the girl. Although given some of the corniest lines of dialouge in this movie, Kirsten Dunst makes an adorable portrayal as Mary Jane Watson, while giving a great chemistry with her co-star. But, Willem Dafoe seems a little miscast playing the deadly Green Goblin, feeling more like he's suitable for drama, instead of action. Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and J.K. Simmons, round up the supporting cast, bringing some memorable performances on-screen, especially Simmons, who steals every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson, the angry editor chief of the Daily Bugle. There are few corny and goofy moments from here and there, but that doesn't stop the exciting momentum that this movie brings. Filled with impressive visual effects and a wonderful music score by Danny Elfman, director Sam Raimi perfectly stays true to the original Spider-Man concept, and delivers plenty of exciting action sequences that are both fun to watch, and stay true to the plot. Behind ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Avengers"", ""Spider-Man"" is probably my third favorite superhero movie. I can watch this movie over and over again, and it's still a fun time. I was easily impressed with this movie, and it never disappoints to entertain. Everyone will find something to enjoy for sure. ""Spider-Man"", in my review, ""a refreshing story, and exciting action"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Amazing!,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Spider-Man,"" which I saw in a screening. I thought the movie was very engrossing.  Director Sam Raimi kept the action quotient high, but also emphasized the human element of the story.  Tobey Maguire was very believable as the gawky teenager in the early part of the film and then, after his run-in with the radioactive, genetically engineered spider, as the athletic, acrobatic superhero of the title. His boyish glee at discovering his new superpowers was infectious and got a lot of laughs.  I also didn't mind the changes to the ""Peter Parker: The Amazing Spider-Man"" comic book story that the film's writers made, e.g., having Spider-Man's web come out of glands in his wrists rather than being an invention of Peter Parker's.  Especially good were Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson as Aunt May and Uncle Ben Parker, Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/the Green Goblin, James Franco as Harry Osborn, and Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson.  And in a small but memorable role, J.K. Simmons (""Oz,"" Law & Order"") as newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson was hilarious.  Perfect casting. I also thought the special effects were very good.  Although I could easily tell when Spidey was a computer-generated image (or a stunt double for that matter), it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the movie. However, I saw the movie with a six-year-old, who found the villainous Green Goblin -- superbly personified by Willem Dafoe -- very, very frightening, so I would advise against taking children younger than 10 years of age to this movie. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" comic book was a childhood favorite of mine, and I can honestly say that Sam Raimi has done it justice!  I'm going to go see this movie again (sans terrified six-year-old).",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Poignant, fun and a  faithful adaptation to the original comic book","Poignant, fun and a  faithful adaptation to the original comic book.  I am very critical of comic book movies since I am a huge fan of the medium and was tremendously disappointed in the Superman and Batman movies (all of them, some greatly!). This film however has again demonstrated that an adaptation of a comic book story can be  fun and faithful to the story, yet be a film for all ages and those who may not have ever even read a comic book.  The Crow was the only other good comic book movie in my opinion, but it was not an all ages fun ride as this is!I had the privilege of seeing the film last night, 4-30-02, in SF with the press and 300+ other folks for its ""Bay Area Premiere"".The acting is the finest portion of the film with the leads giving us depth that I was unsure would be allowed by the style of story chosen.  Maguire was outstanding at being a guy who can rarely catch a break, but attract difficulty with ease and aplomb.  He is awkward with the woman he loves, but eloquent when dealing with the familiar, just as most teenagers are even today.  He gave us wonderful joy at the prospect of ""web swinging"" and kicking some much deserved ass!  Dafoe is wonderfully scary as the man who has succumbed to the power games of the corporate  world that drives a decent man mad striving for perfection in himself while trying to hard to please all the wrong people to no avail and then being consumed by guilt that has built over the years of family neglect which finally helps to push him over the edge when an opportunity to make a huge mistake presents itself.The rest of cast is nearly as spectacular with the J.K. Simmons turning in the best performance in the film as J. Jonah Jamason.  When he appeared on screen things lite up even more and he was on fire making everyone in the audience laugh and myself nearly p** my pants.  Harris as Aunt May and Robertson as Uncle Ben were excellent choices and gave the film a great deal of its credibility and finesse.  Letting what happens to Ben and Peter (I am not telling) was wonderful and the best punctuation to what makes Peter do what he does and brings complete credibility to the story.   I am not a huge Dunst fan, but she was just fine as the love of Peter Parker's life and a person much like Peter only neither was conscious of the fact.  This to me is a more real version of  ""true love"".The script was far stronger than I expected with some wonderful dialog; verbal exchanges, solid plot points and pacing.  Many a good parenting lesson can be found in this film as well as interesting thoughts about the choices that we make in life that we might think are no big deal when in the heat of passion, but may well come back to haunt us if we don't think before we act/speak: which is the trust of the film in my humble opinion.The direction from Raimi was also much better than I anticipated coming from someone who is known (and loved) for his over the top camp and action.  Many of the fight and action sequences where more ""over done"" than I like, but they were solid and much like a comic of the Silver Age from whence the story comes so it fit the film fine.  Nice cinematography without the CGI taking over and detracting from the realism, in fact it made much of the web swinging truly believable.  A few points made things a bit hard to ""believe"", but over all I think most folks will be able to suspend their disbelief.Danny Elfman.  Need I say more?  He is the man when it comes to ""super hero"" music and is the closest thing to John Willams and the late great Bernard Herman there is today.  He subtly sets the mood and most of the audience probably doesn't even realize it.

Spider-Man the movie?  Average.,"This is not the best comic book movie ever.  That honor still belongs to the first Superman.  I enjoyed the Peter Parker scenes, but felt let down by the action, and Danny Elfman's terrible score.  I didn't hate the film, there were moments that were quite good.  Like when Peter is first discovering his Spidey abilities.  But it didn't have that same mythic quality that the first Superman had.  The actors did there best with the script.  J.J Jameson was real good, but the story felt pedestrian.  The rivalry between the Goblin and Spider-Man wasn't developed enough.  I give the film a 7 because it was better than most of the summer blockbusters last year.  (Planet of the Apes anyone?)  But it was missing certain qualities that would have elevated it to classic status.  Go see it and decide for yourself though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A nice comic book adaptation.,"The film's trump card is the casting of Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker, the high school geek who acquires amazing powers after being bitten by a genetically mutated spider.

A Nostalgia-Fueled Classic That Doesn't Fully Hold Up,"I gave Spider-Man (2002) a 5, and honestly, that's me being generous. While many hail it as one of the greatest superhero films ever, I see it more as a movie that thrives on nostalgia rather than actual quality. Yes, it was groundbreaking for its time, especially since the Marvel Cinematic Universe didn't exist yet, but looking back, it doesn't hold up as well as people like to believe.The standout of the film? Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin. He's easily the best part, bringing an intensity and charm that makes his character genuinely compelling. But beyond that, the performances feel stiff, and the dialogue often comes off as awkward and forced. Tobey Maguire, while beloved by many as Peter Parker, felt robotic at times, and the chemistry between characters wasn't convincing.I get why this movie is nostalgic for so many-it was a pioneer in the superhero genre and set the stage for what was to come. But when I strip away the nostalgia goggles, it's just fine. Not terrible, but definitely not the masterpiece some make it out to be. I was torn between a 4 and a 5, but in the end, I settled on a middle ground for its historical significance rather than its execution.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A great comic adaptation,"I saw this movie last night at a preview, and I must say I was impressed. The acting of all the cast was good, especially William Dafoe. I must admit that I wans't quite sure about Tobey Maguire as Peter Paker, but after watching it, I cannot think of anyone who would be better suited to the role.The only places where it changes the orginal comicbook story are when the comicbook is not very believable. So these changes don't harm the story in anyway, but might even make it better.On the whole, I would have to say this movie is definately worth seeing, especially if you are a fan of the comic/cartoon series or just a general comic fan.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"""My Spider Sense is Tingling"" and It's Telling Me This Is One Of The Best Comic Book Movies Ever.","Marvel superheroes are hitting the big screen in waves. First there was blade which made a decent amount at the box office with its 70 + million dollar performance. 2000 brought us X-Men which became a box office hit when it opened with 54 million that summer. The sequel is on its way in 2003. Blade 2 was released in March and it opened with 33 million, an improvement from the 17-18 million the first one opened with. Thr Hulk is now in production with Eric Bana playing the Hulk and Oscar winner, Jennifer Connelly also starring. That film is directed by Ang Lee. After that Daredevil is set to be released and that film stars Ben Affleck, as Daredevil and Jennifer Gardner of Alias also starring. Until then however, we have Spider-Man and judging by the early weekend numbers(114 million opening weekend-highest opening of all time) it seems that people are loving this film. I can say that I more than loved it. I thought it was great.Tobey Maguire takes on the role as Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-Man, a product of being bitten by a mutant spider while on a school field trip. He is in love with the girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Dunst; Bring it On) who is a kind sole but barely notices him. Peter lives with his Aunt May (Harris) and Uncle Ben (Robertson)(fans, like myself, of the comic will know why he's in this living situation). At first Parker is confused by his new skills but soon he begins to use them to his advantage.Parker uses his new skills to fight in a wrestling match to get money for various things, one being a way to impress Mary Jane. After the match however tragedy strikes and Parker fully realizes that ""With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility"" and through this ""Spider-Man"" is born.Spidey's nemesis in the round is Norman Osborne (Dafoe; Shadow of the Vampire), a somewhat mad/determined scientist who needs to prove that his experiments work. After testing them on himself, something goes wrong and the Green Goblin is born.I was quite surprised how much Tobey Maguire filled into the role; he not only makes it his own but manages to give it a little character behind the mask. He has that innocent, everyday man quality about him that makes you believe in him. It's a performance that has much more depth than you would expect, especially from a comic book movie.The supporting cast takes a back seat to Spider-Man, lavish sets and ultimately some nice special effects, but they get the job done. Willem Dafoe has gotten back into my good graces after the atrocious Speed 2. He does a good job as the Green Goblin and doesn't overdo it. Now, it's not as memorable or great as Nicholson's Joker, but he makes a formable foe to Spider-Man. What I liked about his performance was that he didn't over-shadow the hero, much like the Joker did in Batman. Dafoe is given the right amount of screentime to establish his character but not too much to the point where it becomes a movie about him rather than Peter/Spider-ManThe other two notable cast mates are Kirsten Dunst and James Franco. Franco had actually gone in to the audition for the role of Peter Parker but ended up playing Harry Osborne, the villain's son. I liked Franco as Peter Parker's roommate and best friend and love the idea of the continuity aspect of the plot.(You'll see when you view the film)Kirsten Dunst is even a good casting choice. What could've easily been an eye-candy role is taken to another level. She's very likable in the role and her chemistry with Maguire is natural and not forced.This is good transition into the screenwriting by one of my favorites, David Koepp, who was the master behind films like Stir of Echoes and Panic Room. He brings Spider-Man to life with the help of Maguire and director Sam Raimi (A Simple Plan). The plot even over-shadows the great CGI in my opinion. The storyline is slightly more developed than most movies of this nature and is driven by its characters. I liked that aspect of the film very much.Spider-Man also features some funny moments like a cameo by Bruce Campbell (of Evil Dead fame) as a Vince McMahon type ring master who gave Parker the name of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" and Peter Parker having fun swinging from building to building. The J Jonah Jameson character is also very funny. He makes the transition from comic to screen very well. Dead on representation.Spider-Man is the ultimate comic book movie that not only looks like it came from the comics, but adds in the sounds and some dialogue. From the opening credits to the last shot, you could see it in an issue of ""Spider-Man"". Like X-Men, the film is bright with colorful characters and big time action scenes. It reaches the level of my favorite comic book movie, Batman, and maybe after more viewings it could surpass it.Overall, Spider-Man is a fun romp of comic book action. With a great story, acting, special effects, and a lot of heart Spider-Man is a perfect start to the summer season and i'm glad it's leading the pack.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

What I was hoping for and more.,"Usually when there is a big summer movie I am looking forward to, I wait and wait and then the movie comes out and it is a big disappointment. I really looked forward to the American Godzilla movie and by golly it was a huge disappointment. Then I really looked forward to Star Wars episode 1 and although it was not the disappointment Godzilla was, it was still a disappointment. Spider-man however was everything I was hoping it to be. In fact, it has to be considered one of the best comic book adaptations ever. It actually took parts of the comic book and incorporated it into the movie. Unlike most comic book movies where the story doesn't come from any of the comic books. Sure there are some departures such as the organic web shooters, but this is acceptable seeing as how watching Peter Parker learning he has them makes for some humorous scenes. The entire cast did a great job capturing the characters they were playing and there are some great fights as well. This is also a departure from most comic book movies where there is really no good fight at all between the heroes and villains.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Toby Maguire spins a mean web...excellent fun movie...,"One of the most successful translations of ""comic book to screen"" has fine results in SPIDER-MAN, a handsomely produced version of the comic book classic with a sprightly score by Danny Elfman and some incredibly realistic looking CGI effects.The simple plot of good vs. evil begins when Peter Parker is bitten by a spider while touring a local museum with his high school class. The plot thickens when he develops webs and the ability to soar over rooftops and vehicles with ease--as well as climbing walls. Toby Maguire plays the nerdy teen-ager with a wholesome air of innocent charm, his open-eyed expression never concealing the delight he takes in the role. As his girlfriend, Mary Jane, Kirsten Dunst does a likable enough job even if the costume department decided to dress her like a teen hooker.Everyone else is in fine form. William Dafoe deserves top praise for his Green Goblin--evil enough to frighten the wits out of the faint-hearted. J. Jonah Jameson is excellent as the bombastic newspaper editor who takes advantage of his most famous client. Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson, in quieter roles, are warm and human. James Franco is believable as Peter's best friend.Admirers of the comic book tales should have no trouble liking the movie with its amazing CGI effects. It's heart-warming and funny, with some terror thrown in for good measure. Good escapist entertainment even if the message seems a little vague. Message??",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's Got Magic,"I remember Spider-man from my youth. I never got into the comics, so I apologize to the true web driven literati. I know the story. And I've watches and read about a lot of superheroes. My son came back from seeing the film, angry and hurt because they took liberties with one of his real loves. I went to it to watch a movie, not to pay homage. I think it's a heck of a good film. To start with, the vertiginous special effects are wonderful. His leaps from building to building are breathtaking. The best part is that Tobey Maguire has a vulnerability that the alter ego needs to have . Like so many, he is reluctant, but forces beyond his control dump him into the middle of things over which he has not control.I'm told the villain is not kosher. The they should have chosen one of his more formidable adversaries. I thought the guy was pretty spooky and set up more of the same. Peter Parker has some unburned bridges heading into the sequel, and that's always fun. There's just a niceness that connects the characters and a bitter world to fight against, including the newsman who has no respect for Peter's talents. I think this movie is thoughtful as well as really exciting.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Raimi and Maguire weave a magical web in this excellent comic adaptation,"Studios lately have been known to spend almost $200 million dollars bringing a comic book super hero to life on the silver screen.  With $200 million dollars you can buy  many state of the art special effects for the director to full around with to his hearts content.  If in the process, though, he decides to fore-go an entertaining story and script, characters that we can get to know and sympathize with, and good actors to bring those characters to life, all the special effects in the world isn't going to amount to a hill of beans.  Fortunately for us, in bringing Marvel Comic's Spiderman to life, Sam Raimi did care about those little details and the audience is richly rewarded because of it.One of the trickier tasks when transferring a film such as Spiderman to film is in giving us enough background story.  If a writer and director spend too much time on the origins of the character, it has a tendency to bog the rest of the film down.  Likewise, if it is given short thrift, we never have a chance to become involved emotionally with the super-hero.  In Spiderman, Raimi, aided immeasurably by Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spiderman strikes just the right note.  Maguire is such an accomplished actor, that he immediately establishes Peter Parker as someone we will care about throughout the film.  He has a crush on the beautiful girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), is constantly harassed by the school jerk, and has a best friend, Harry  (James Franco), who's relationship with his father Norman (Willem Dafoe)is far from perfect.  As for Peter, he has an exceptional home life with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) which is probably one of the reasons Harry develops an early kinship with him.  That and the fact that Harry's father seems to think more of Peter than he does of his own son at times.After having been bitten by a mutated spider, Peter awakens one morning to find himself with some exceptional super powers.  He develops muscles that he didn't have before, has reflexes Michael Jordan would be proud of, and can shoot a web like nobody's business.  It is during these early scenes of discovery by Peter that the film truly excels.  Maguire is like a child whom after taking his first steps, learns he can motor about the house quite nicely, thank you very much.  We can't help but have as much fun watching Peter Parker hone his skills as he seems to have in being able to do these magnificent feats.Another fine aspect of Spiderman is the love story that develops between Parker and Mary Jane.  As Peter Parker, he is never able to quite overcome his inability to tell Mary Jane of his true feelings.  Later, as Spiderman, there is a wonderful scene between him and Mary Jane in a drenching downpour that any romantic film would envy.Whereas some have not been too enamored of Dafoe's portrayal as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, I found both to be right on the mark.  As Norman, we see how his continuous drive to control his company alienates and spoils the relationship he has with his son Harry.  It's not that Norman is an evil person, his quest for power has led him to more or less take his son for granted.  Later, when after a lab accident, it is the schizophrenic battle between the normal Harry and the Evil Harry that brings the Green Goblin to life.  It would have been easy for Raimi to have the lab accident just turn Harry instantly into the Green Goblin, but instead we get a richer more dramatic story that we wouldn't have had otherwise.Likewise James Franco, who looks enough like Dafoe that they could be father and son, is a youth who seems tormented by the fact that no matter what success he achieves, his father never gives him his just due.  Kirsten Dunst is also beautiful and charming as Mary Jane.  Her romantic scenes with Spiderman are wonderfully played, and she has an especially moving scene with Peter Parker as the film draws to a close.As for the special effects, they are indeed spectacular.  As Spiderman swoops between buildings on his web, you won't think once that it's not really him doing so.  When reading IMDB reviews of this film or any other film that depends heavily on  special effects, one must keep in mind that it has become more or less a hobby among some to downgrade the effects of any film so my advice is to just ignore the criticism in that regard.  The effects here are fine.Two years ago, it was with quite a bit of eagerness that I anticipated Raimi's Spiderman film and it lived up to my hopes in every aspect.  If the impending sequel comes even close to being as good as the original, it'll be a job well done.  And if a film such as Spiderman can have me counting the days until Spiderman II, than I have no choice but to give it my grade, which for Spiderman is an A.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Stylish, yet somewhat disappointing!","Being an avid fan of the comic book I really looked forward to this movie and for a long time I convinced myself that I liked the film. However, after a long time of self denial I bought the Spider-Man DVD and I saw the film for what it truly was. A disappointment. The magic from the comic books had evaporated.The acting in the film is a mixed bag. Tobey Maguire is well cast but his overall acting and presence isn't very good. He does the nerd part very well but when it comes to being a super hero he falls short. Spider-Man was always a complex character with great internal struggles but the film medium doesn't convey this very well because we don't get the inner monologue that Spider-Man is so well known for. He therefore has to act with facial expressions and body language. Tobey has a pretty well defined body language but his facial expressions are somewhat lacking. Also the fact that he is wearing the Spider-Man suit in many scenes prevent us from clearly reading what is going on in his head at the moment. Kirsten Dunst is just miscast. She is a horrible actress with zero talent and no resemblance with the character she plays making her performance utterly unbelievable. Willem Dafoe is usually a brilliant actor but in Spider-Man he seems to have dumbed down quite a bit and although his schizophrenic scenes are pretty interesting they do not cover for the fact that this is Dafoe's most mediocre performance in years. James Franco who plays Harry Osborn is remarkably boring in his performance. His voice never seems to change making him a young Keanu Reeves. The most interesting and well cast actor is J.K. Simmons who plays J. Jonah Jameson and if there was ever a guy who looked like the character he is meant to play it is Simmons. This is in both looks, voice and presence.The overall effects in the movie are undoubtedly very good and this makes the action sequences seem more believable. Spider-Man was nominated for an Oscar in the effects department but deservedly the Oscar went to The Fellowship of the Ring because while the effects are good they are far from brilliant. I will even go as far as to say that the only really good effects scene is the one at the very end where Spider-Man swings through the city. This scene, however, almost saves the film because it is brilliant and it is the only scene I can watch again and again.Danny Elfman's score is very good and it really suiting for a super hero movie. It really shows that Elfman has done a super hero movie score before. I am of course referring to Batman which is undoubtedly one of the best scores ever and you can certainly feel that Elfman used some of the experiences from that film in Spider-Man. The score has an epic feel to it that suits the film very well. The music is beyond reproach.Where the film fails is in the fact that it is too proper and it feels too much like it was adapted for kids which is in my opinion a mistake because the film had tremendous potential but it seems wasted because it never really becomes an adult film. Also the ending on the bridge is based on a well known story in the Spider-Man mythology where Spider-Man's first love Gwen Stacy dies in Spider-Man's battle with Green Goblin. I think they should have brought on Gwen Stacy for the first film and then introduced Mary Jan in the second movie. because it would have given Spider-Man a greater sense of loss and a better reason to hate Green Goblin if his first love had died at his hands but instead Raimi plays it safe and has Spider-Man save both the children in the lift and Mary Jane. It just seems too stupid.All in all Spider-Man was not the movie I was hoping for. I expected the best film ever and it certainly didn't deliver. Having said that and having seen the film a couple of times on DVD now I have grown to appreciate it a bit more. My primary issue with the film is that seems that the film wasn't directed for the fans of the character who expected a better adaptation but instead the film becomes a main stream Blockbuster with a wide range which isn't necessarily a bad thing but being a hardcore Spider-Man fan I would have liked to see a more adult film. Spider-Man is a good effort though and the effects alone deserve to be watched.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Oh yeah !,"I truly don't know what to say about this movie, which got already allpossible praises and all possible critics ! But I will write what I canfrom my heart, cause my post cannot match any reviews from grammaticalsuper humans and ultra intelligent movie critics ! OK lets start :This movie is directed by one of my favorite film directors Sam Raimi who directed and produced so many good movies and one I love the most is TV series adaptation of Evil Dead (also directed by him) movie, Ash vs Evil Dead which also have mostly positive reviews by top critics. I think ratings go well over 90% on rotten tomatoes !Spider-Man is supremely made from beginning till end. Every scene is so fresh, playful, innocent and there is no second of boredom in this one ! I think its the best movie of all movies about Spider- Man and they surely knew why Sam Raimi would be perfect man for directing it ! Special effects are just right amount and they don't look artificial at all ! You really have feeling like being part of this world of super heroes and super villains ! So if you wanna movie to look good give it to Spielberg, Peter Jackson or Sam Raimi ! In all three cases you cannot miss ! Acting could be flawed but movie will look good ! Cause I really love movies about super heroes, with Superman first part being one of my favorite movies ever, but I love also Batman and actually all marvel produced world of super heroes, including X-men franchise (Nine movies until 2016, Deadpool is really great, as well as all others, yup I like also those three banned by critics) Why I wrote this review in 2016 if movie was made 2002 ? I always loved this movie,I guess I would like to support its ratings to go for tiny bit higher ! So for me everything is perfect in this movie - acting, effects, story, scenery for me all this is 10/10 ! On of rare movies I can say that without least doubt ! Just one more thing- 3rd part of Spider Man from 2007(also directed by Sam Raimi) was little bit over criticized by movie critics ! I know they know what to write, they are not stupid of course, but still maybe we became little to spoiled by both mega successful and genius parts before that one (2002 and 2004) cause they said ; in this 3rd part problem is there is too much of everything, but I think Sam Raimi just wanted to conclude franchise with spectacular finish, so in my eyes it was unjustly rated and my rate for all three parts is 10/10 without any doubt ! Thank You Sam for so many excellent movies and to make our life more fun !!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"I liked what I saw, even though I'm not a fan of comic books","Comic books like Spider-man, Superman, Hellboy,... have always been a part of the American popular culture, but aren't well known by the biggest part of the European public. So when a movie, based on one of these comics (we've seen several passing by in the multiplexes in recent years) is released, its main audience will be American as well. Unless they make something spectacular out of it of course, and that's exactly what the makers did with this movie. Spider-man is a movie full of spectacular computer animated graphics, plenty of action and symbolism and, much to my surprise, with a decent story (even though that's not the main reason why you should watch this movie).Peter Parker is a nerdy high school student who gets bitten by a genetically modified spider. Its DNA gets mixed with Parker's DNA and gradually he finds out that he now has capabilities he could only dream of before. He's strong, he can scale walls and ceilings without any help or appliances and he has some kind of sense that allows him to avoid dangerous situations. At first he only uses his powers to make money as an amateur wrestler, but when his uncle gets killed by a criminal, he decides to use his powers only to fight crime and to help society and to win the affections of his classmate Mary Jane Watson. In the meantime Norman Osborn, a scientist and businessman is exposed to some kind of nerve gas that he was developing for the military and develops an alternative personality: the evil Green Goblin.Despite the fact that the Green Goblin looked more like a bad guy from the ""Power Ranger"" and wasn't very original or impressive to me, the entire movie wasn't as bad as I feared. I actually had a good time watching this movie that, let's be honest, wouldn't get much attention if the stunning computer graphics weren't in it. So, despite the fact that I'm not a fan of comic books and the fact that the Green Goblin wasn't the most successful character, I liked what I saw. That's why I give it a 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Amazingly Spectacularly Great,"Having seen the trailers for this film I have to say that I didn't walk into the cinema with high hopes. The computer effects looked badly integrated, the Green Goblin's costume looked awful and comic book adaptations usually have such painful scripting and plotting. Thankfully I was wrong on most counts (The Goblin still looks rubbish).As it turns out, this is probably the best super-hero film I've yet seen - certainly up there with Superman and Batman. People seem to automatically comment that the script and acting was bad because they expect it to be the case in these films; and indeed it usually is. But if you go into Spider-man without this prejudicial attitude you'll be pleasently suprised. The acting is generally great - there is never a time when anyone is not believable as their character and you think ""Hey, that's an actor, not Peter Parker"". The effects do look artificial but the pace of the movie means you don't have time to dwell on this and the script is fine! What do people want, Shakespearian soliloquies? That would sound incredibly out-of-place in modern day New York. There are few of the painful cliches or dreadful dialogue that plague films like The Phantom Menace and the catchphrases like ""friendly neighbourhood spider-man"" are fully in-keeping with the character.The comic turns from J.J. Jameson hit the mark, the snarling facial contortions of Willem Defoe were suitably evil-looking (and the conversation with his mirror-image was a great touch). My only gripe was with the Green Goblin's costume. Very monotone green and not very scary.All-in-all a great film that I wouldn't hesitate for a second in recommending.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A real film,"This film is so good! Like a real film, not as an amusement park.From a time when superhero films could be made without jokes every 20 seconds. From a time when they cared about great scores (epic this one!), adapting the music to each moment (even horror vibes in some scenes, like the attempted rape). From a time when they cared about relationships, real feelings and they looked like real people with big character development. Raimi was not rushing anything. He was not afraid to use silence when it was necessary. He knows what pace is and the visual effects are here to support something, not to be the main star.All these people could belong to the real world. I think that is what I love the most about this film. They are not joking about shagging the aunt in the middle of an epic fight. They could be us. In our world.

"""You're taller than you look.""","Nerdy teenager Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is bit by a radioactive spider and develops new powers and abilities. After the murder of his uncle, Peter decides to use his powers to help people and fight crime. Meanwhile, billionaire Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) undergoes an experiment that gives him superhuman abilities of his own. It also drives him crazy and sets him on a collision course with Spider-Man.Maguire, James Franco, and J.K. Simmons are all great. Kirsten Dunst wasn't my ideal Mary Jane but she actually does very good. She's likable and pretty, which is about all the part is asking for here. The Green Goblin is probably the movie's biggest failing. They didn't really get his character right and Willem Dafoe's performance is too campy. Changing him into an armored goon didn't help matters.The bright, mostly upbeat tone is exactly what a Spider-Man movie needs. However, it does highlight some of the fakeness of the CGI. The special effects are generally good although at times when Spider-Man is complete CGI he has that rubber-limbed thing going on. The organic web shooters bothered me more before I saw the movie than it did while watching. Although I could've done without the gross microscopic closeups of his fingertips to show us how ""spidery"" he is. Danny Elfman's score is forgettable and not in the same league as his work with Batman.Not quite the defining movie for Spider-Man as '78 Superman or '89 Batman were for those characters, but good nonetheless.

Disappointment for fans,"I used to read the comic of this super-hero and I can say that I was a great fan. When I heard that the movie was out on cinemas I urged to watch it. The movie for someone who has not ever read the comic, might seem an excellent work, but for those fans who grew up reading it propably might regard it as average. The director, Raimi, created just a good action movie with a super-hero who impresses the viewer with his skills. The story is good but I think the complaint of most of the real fans is that the director failed to represent Spider-man as he really was in the comics. The character played by Tobie Maguire was disappointing and the fact that he had never read a single issue of the comic prior to the movie, speaks for its self.

If only...,"The whole point of Spider-Man is what would happen if a real person was a superhero? What if a superhero really existed? In real life? What if there was a superhero, not a Kryptonian in fictional Metropolis, but a real kid in New York?The suit used in the movie just emphasised the fact that the film was a typical superhero movie. It's a given that superheroes in films have cool costumes; Batman, Spawn, the X-Men, etc. So Spidey followed this, as the audience expected. But the whole point is that Peter can't make a cool, high-tech costume because he doesn't have the resources or the means. He's just a kid, doing what he can.If Spider-Man actually existed, he would look like the Nicolas Hammond 1970's TV version. A cheap, garish and silly costume (in the comics, Spidey's costume was often criticised) is exactly what Spidey originally wore in the comics and so wore in the TV show, and would wear in real life.The cheap costume is endearing. It shows this average guy is doing his best to be a superhero, trying his hardest with the little he has. We can all relate to it, as it's about as good as the average person could do, no better.I feel if the director Sam Raimi and co had been brave enough to make a film of the Spidey concept (a superhero in real life, cheap costume and all) and not try and animate comicbook panels, then we'd really be onto something.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Garish and cartoony,"As a fan of Spiderman I was deeply let down by this stupid, gaudy, 'Hollywood' movie version. There are so many things wrong with it I could go on for ages.First of all, it's HORRIBLY miscast. Tobey Maguire is NO Peter Parker, he is so completely wrong for the part. Jake Gyllenhaal could have been much better. Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane Watson seemed like a typical studio-exec choice. Instead of finding someone who could actually be a model/actress with a statuesque figure, real auburn hair with green eyes who could bring some integrity to the part we have ' the hottie from Bring It On who all the teenage guys like'. I personally do not find her attractive and her part in the movie is no more than 'the damsel in distress when necessary to the plot' kind. She's such a stronger character in the comic book and it's been totally ignored here. James Franco as Harry Osborne was useless. I've seen more charismatic performances from furniture. Willem Dafoe was okay as the Green Goblin but some of his dialogue was real bad, it felt like rejected Skeletor jibes from the original He-Man show. He did provoke some sympathy and coped well with the inner-turmoil story but I could not help but think that someone else could have done it better. JK Simmons and Bruce Campbell were the only bright spots among the whole cast.27-year-old Tobey Maguire plays high school student Peter Parker. A 'boy' who is blessed with web-spinning capabilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider on a field trip. You guessed it, this is another 'origins of' story. I HATE it when comic-book superhero movies feel the need to do this. Honestly, who DOESN'T know who Spiderman is or how he got his powers? The fact that Spiderman is so popular (as a franchise) is the only reason this tawdry-looking movie was a hit. I would have had so much more respect for it if it went straight to the action and didn't waste time setting things up. No superhero movie is willing to do this and it only proves even further that Spiderman was cooked up and packaged in board room meetings.As a way of disguising the fact that the whole thing is no more than processed cheese, eccentric director Sam Raimi was hired to direct. Known for his cheap but whacky movies Raimi had never really done anything big budget before this. The result is a meretricious, mess of a movie that is all over the place. I honestly thought I had walked into some Power Rangers movie.The computer effects are, quite simply, hideous. Who are they honestly trying to fool with this stuff? It boggles the mind how they ended up with an Academy Award nomination. They are really, really bad. The Styrofoam shark in Jaws: The Revenge was more convincing.Danny Elfman cranks out YET ANOTHER superhero movie score for this 'un. It's flat, boring and unimpressive. Aunt May is way too old. The Green Goblin looks like a Power Ranger. The direction is uncontrolled. It's got a poor cast. The story is nothing new or daring (check out the comic books for that). It's assembled by a boardroom committee, not crafted by people who care and it's just loud, dumb entertainment when Spiderman really should be much more.The only part I appreciated was the way they made Spiderman's web biological instead of manufactured. It just makes so much more sense this way. Though there are loads out there who disagree with me.The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen (I seriously think this film would have benefited from and deserved scope-widescreen but no luck) and it looks better than average. There are some color problems and it doesn't look too crisp. The Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is typically loud and thumping but it's nothing particularly dynamic. There are quite a few extras if you're really that much of a fan. As I couldn't care any less for this film I can't comment.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

An Honest Review,"It is clearly a Sam Raimi film. You see that right away in the sense of humor. Make it cheesy and cheap enough and the audience will laugh at it sort of humor...and it works.You laugh when you see the cheap jokes, the low-budget moments in a high budget film, it all adds to the appeal, it makes it fun to watch.Plus, Peter Parker is the Dork we all know him to be. He's the nerd, the dweeb, and the smart alack that has to keep cracking jokes so he doesn't have to face the life and death reality of what he's actually doing.Tobey Maguire excels at bringing Peter Parker to the big screen in a way that stays true to the character and the source material. He is far better than the travesty of Andrew Garfield's Spider Bully.You get the sense with Maguire that Spider Man is a hero and not Garfield's excuse to mock and bully people while pretending to be a good guy.Maguire is a great fit for Raimi's vision of Spider Man and between the two of them the film delivers as much in action as it does in comedy.Sit back and enjoy it, no matter how old you are it's worth the ride.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Sam Raimi's Spider-Man sets the standard for Early 2000s Superhero films,"Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a nerdy and meek high schooler who is often the object of casual abuse and teasing by most of the school. Peter has a crush on ""girl next door"" Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but doesn't act on it out of fear of rejection leaving his best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), to develop a relationship with her instead. On a field trip to Columbia University Peter is bitten by a genetically engineered Spider and gradually manifests physical changes such as enhanced strength, heightened alertness, ability to cling to walls and ceilings, and shooting webbing from his wrists. Peter initially uses these powers for personal gain, but following the death of his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) that Peter feels indirectly responsible for, Peter becomes the masked hero Spider-Man while also attending classes and working part time taking pictures of his Spider-Man persona to sell to abrasive tabloid newspaper owner/editor J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons) to help alleviate the financial strain on his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris). Meanwhile, Harry's father, scientist/CEO Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) under intense pressure from imminent loss of a lucrative military contract to a rival company decides to test a dangerous enhancement formula on himself which works but unleashes a dangerous split personality in the Green Goblin.One of Marvel Comics most iconic and beloved characters, Spider-Man has seen various incarnations in other media since the 60s with notable animated and live action adaptations on TV. Attempts had been made at bringing the character to feature film since the 80s with attempts by Roger Corman, Cannon Films, Carolco, James Cameron and even MGM being stalled for various reasons be they creative or financial until the rights were eventually obtained by Sony following an agreement with MGM regarding disputed rights to the James Bond novels Casino Royale and Thunderball (long story there). A number of directors were considered including Tim Burton, David Fincher, Michael Bay and many others until Amy Pascal's championed pick of Sam Raimi was hired primarily from his enthusiasm for the character stemming from the directors childhood fandom having read the early Stan Lee and Steve Ditko era comics of the Silver Age. When the movie was released in May of 2002, Spider-Man became the first film to have a $100 million opening weekend and made over $800 million worldwide becoming the third highest grossing film of 2002 with only Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets beating it. The movie is seen as one of the first major events that ushered in most what defined the early 2000s take on the Superhero genre (along with the X-Men movies) and while the film has definitely aged, it's a charming film in its own right that shows a real love for the character.Tobey Maguire is really good playing Peter Parker with his nerd mannerisms being reminiscent of Rick Moranis' take on Seymour from Little Shop of Horrors in terms of delivery. While it's admittedly a broad performance it works well for the type of world and tone the movie strives towards (more on that). Kirsten Dunst is also good as Peter's friend/love interest Mary Jane Watson as is James Franco as Peter's best friend harry Osborn and the three play off each other quite nicely giving a strong sense of camaraderie to their interactions. Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris are also good as Uncle Ben and Aunt May respectively with some really good moments between Maguire and Robertson and Harris giving us that warm familial dynamic that resonates strongly with us. Willem Dafoe is also quite good as Norman Osborn and is quite chilling in his normal guise as a shrewd and aggressive businessman but is also bursting with scenery chewing enthusiasm when adopting the Green Goblin persona. But by far the best part bar none is J. K. Simmons as Daily Bugle editor/owner J. Jonah Jameson whose fast talking tightly wound delivery and persona make him one of the most endearing and entertaining staples of the movie.Because the technology used for Spider-Man swinging through the city and performing elaborate acrobatics was still in its infancy, the movie's effects have not aged gracefully and there's a number of scenes that are often rubbery or lacking in weight. The visual effects for the movie were handled by industry veteran John Dykstra who helped bring the space battles of Star Wars to life so he's a quality talent to have on a project likes this, but the technology and effects were very rough around this time with Raimi mostly used to practical effects rather than digital ones and the effects for Spider-Man were a level above what had been attempted with CGI especially regarding superhero movies. There's also some noticeable gaffes in editing that make flow confusing or make a scene feel sloppy but these are mostly forgivable. But the biggest sticking point will be the movie's tone and delivery which has a goofiness to it because the movie maybe adheres a little too closely to the comics it bases itself upon. While the Stan Lee/Steve Ditko era of Spider-Man comics are regarded as classics for good reason, they were also written in the 1960s during the Silver Age of comics wherein storytelling was very compressed and dialogue was overly blunt and direct lacking in polish or nuance. The story structure of Spider-Man is perfect with the pacing well done with everything established efficiently and effectively while telling a satisfying story with a strong emotional core. However the dialogue is filled with little ""quirks"" that feel like they're taking that Silver Age style of writing that comes off as a little eye brow raising especially in modern day and live action.Spider-Man may be a little dated in some aspects, but it's a film that exudes passion and love for the characters and the comic with clear effort made by people who believed in the core of Spider-Man. The movie served as the template for many superhero films of the early 2000s and its influence can still be felt on later superhero movies thanks to the foundations established by Sam Raimi and Spider-Man.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

the real spider man,"""Spider Man 1"" was a small industrial revolution, 6 years before Marvel started building its universe, Sam Raimi was in charge of adapting one of the biggest comics for the cinema, and it's amazing that even with the dated visual effects, this movie was very well built.Spider-Man's script is one of its greatest virtues, although a little cliché, we don't have a construction focused on combat only, we have a beautiful origin story, with great development arcs not only by Peter Parker but also by Norman Osborn, Mary Jane , Harry Osborn in addition to Peter's uncles who play a perfect role of tutor in the hero's arc, with constructive details of the character's own character and mute problems, Peter doesn't want to save the world, he just wants to make a difference to his neighborhood, the The pain of the hero's growth here and its consequences are details that are lacking in today's practically canned superhero movie market.Tobey Maguire, has a weak acting, it's true, the actor is little expressive, but he is charismatic and sells very well the character that makes him an icon in the film, the same happens with Kirsten Dunst, and all the rest of the supporting cast is really very good with a big emphasis on Willem Dafoe who simply steals the scene whenever he appears, the actor, besides being absurdly expressive and scary has a unique screen presence.The aerial visual effects have aged well, but the combat scenes haven't, but we can forgive, by the way, it's been 20 years since its release, the film is immortalized, although nowadays films of this genre are cold, little authorial and simply common, Sam Raimi's Spider-Man is the opposite of that, building a unique and striking identity. 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

If you want to keep your kid busy for two hours, put this on for them, but you'll probably be just as engaged as they will be. The theme is also very recognizable. What makes Spider-Man so great is that he learns responsibility after many mistakes, which makes him relatable. The acting is great while the dialogue is cheesy, but that's what you'll get out of any early 2000 comic book movie.

Still quite good...,"When I opted to sit down and watch the 2002 movie ""Spider-Man"" once again here in 2024, it was because I haven't actually watched it since it was released. So it was due time to revisit director Sam Raimi's 2002 movie.The storyline in ""Spider-Man"", as written by Stan Lee, Steve Ditko and David Koepp, is an enjoyable one. It is a well-written script that is easy for viewers to get immersed into; even for newcomers who aren't familiar with the Spider-Man comic books. And it is also a rather enjoyable and action-packed script, so the viewers are in for quite a ride throughout the course of the 121 minutes that the movie runs for.But the ""Spider-Man"" movie is more than just a good story, because the casting in the movie is great. I have to say that Tobey Maguire is rather well cast for the role of Peter Parker and Spider-Man, and he really carries the movie and the role quite nicely. But the icing on the cake in Tobey ""Spider Man"" is definitely Willem Dafoe in the role of Green Goblin and Norman Osborn; he is just phenomenally cast for the role and brings the villainous Green Goblin to life on the screen with grace and character. ""Spider-Man"" also have the likes of Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, and J. K. Simmons on the cast list. And there are some great appearances from Bruce Campbell and Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage as well.The acting performances in ""Spider-Man"" are good, and the casted actors and actresses do great jobs in bringing their characters and the story to life on the screen.Visually then ""Spider-Man"" is good. The movie is, however, showing signs of being 22 years old, as some of the CGI looks a bit dubious. But the overall impression is good, and the movie still holds ground today.If you haven't seen director Sam Raimi's 2002 movie ""Spider-Man"" already, then you definitely should do so, regardless of liking superhero movies or not, because it is well-worth watching. And it is a movie that you can watch more than once.I have been thoroughly entertained each time I've sat down to watch ""Spider-Man"". So it certainly is a movie that I warmly recommend, and I am not overly keen on superhero movies in general.My rating of ""Spider-Man"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spider-Man,"The best single movie for the superhero, Toby Maguire, the best actor in the role of Spider-Man, the villain of the film was excellent, the character of Mj in the film was the closest to Mj in the comics The film embodied the world of Spiderman greatly and all other series failed to approach the level of the Tobey Maguire trilogy",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Better than I expected,"When I first heard they were making a Spider-Man movie, I was horrified. The thought of seeing Toby MaGuire dressed as Spider-Man just had me thinking of the Power Rangers, and that's about what I was expecting.  The more I saw the trailers, and the more I saw the commercials, the more I wanted to really hate this movie.  At the same time, I found myself this past week really curious about the film, and thinking it may be better than what I expect.  And I must admit, this was a good movie. The story wasn't great, but it was good enough to keep my interest.  The love story between Mary Jane and Peter Parker actually added to the movie, which is usually not the case in the super hero genre of film.  There were a couple moments when I was reminded of the Power Rangers, but those moments usually came from the Green Goblin, and not from Spier-Man.  I think the most amazing thing is there were several attempts at humor, and for most part, they were actually funny (my personal favorite came when Peter Parker was on the roof attempting to figure out how to sling his webs). So despite my best efforts, I did enjoy Spider-Man.  So if you are a Spider-Man fan, or just think Kristen Dunst looked really hot with red hair, you should enjoy this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One more churned out by the popcorn mill,"Rarely do I feel as misanthropic as I do when I get home from a movie as bad as this one, and as popular as this one. Sure, it will fade by morning, but until then my dreams will be haunted be the ludicrous villainy, predictable action and motherhood-and-apple-pie cheese of Spider-Man. While Tobey MacGuire was an excellent choice, the whole movie was just lurching through the motions; there were no surprises, the whole thing felt paper-thin. Many cliches were strung together to lengthen the otherwise trivially simple plot - geek getting his own back against high-school bully, agonizing death scenes, and much puppy-dog romance which everyone else seems to have found adorable. I found it simply tedious.While the movie had some nice effects, it is, as one might expect, just another entry in a sad list of superhero flicks that are more or less indistinguishable from one another.

*A Groundbreaking Web-Slinger Timeless Classic*,"Whenever I think of Spider-Man, I think of this film!!! Spider-Man is my all time favourite Marvel character. This film is my first ever super-hero film i watched and also my first Marvel movie too. Everything about this film feels right in my opinion. From the amazing casting, the action set pieces, the practical effects, the story, the emotion and the overall tone of the film!!The film's greatest strength lies in its portrayal of Peter Parker. Tobey Maguire delivers a nuanced performance, capturing the character's awkwardness, intelligence, and unwavering sense of responsibility. His transformation from bullied outcast to heroic figure is both inspiring and relatable. Whenever I think of Spider-Man, I always come back to Tobey Maguire. Kirsten Dunst is cast well as Mary Jane. I think she made for this role and she has great chemistry with Maguire too. James Franco is great as Harry Osborn.""With great power comes great responsibility"". These words, spoken by Peter Parker's uncle Ben during their last conversation and which have become Spider-Man's motto, also perfectly represent the challenge Sam Raimi was facing when asked to bring one of America's most loved superheroes to the screen.The film's visual effects, while dated by today's standards, were groundbreaking for their time. The iconic shots of Spider-Man swinging through the city are still thrilling to watch. Moreover, the film effectively balances action sequences with heartfelt moments, making the audience genuinely invested in the characters' journeys.Willem Dafoe is absolutely terrifying as the Green Goblin. A truly great and memorable performance of one of my favourite Spider-Man villains. He really owns this role to be honest. His portrayal of Norman Osborn's descent into madness is both chilling and captivating. He's entertaining, menacing, funny, creepy and even scary. The complex relationship between Peter and Norman adds depth to the story, making the conflict all the more compelling. I honestly cannot think of anyone else who could play this role like Dafoe.Films other supporting cast like, Rosemary Harris (Aunt May), Cliff Robertson (Uncle Ben) and JK Simmons(J Jonah Jameson) also deliver standout performances. JK Simmons is perfectly cast as J Jonah Jameson!!He steals every scene he is in. The film is filled with memorable quotes and scenes that have become ingrained in pop culture.Danny Elfman gives a truly fantastic music score. Elfman's music effectively enhances the emotional impact of the film. The score is at its best during the action sequences, where it propels the narrative forward with its driving rhythms and soaring brass. However, it also shines in the quieter moments, providing a beautiful and melancholic backdrop to the character's inner struggles. Danny Elfman's score is a vital component of the film's success and its impact on the audience is undeniable.*Spider-Man* is a timeless classic that stands the test of time. It's a film that perfectly blends action, drama, and humor, creating a truly unforgettable cinematic experience. Whether you're a longtime fan or new to the character, this film is a must-watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A all time favorite super hero movie,"The first Spider-Man is effortlessly fun, thrilling, touching, ... I will always have a soft spot for this one.

Best Spiderman adapted to the screen.,"Sam Raimi is a film virtuoso. Able to deliver entertaining movies on a low budget, it made the proper transition to big-budget movies successfully. This film honors the best tradition of the arachnid hero and allows a faithful and adequate rendition of the comic to be offered on screen. All the characters resemble the ones we knew in our childhood and the cast was wisely selected. For this reason this film represents the best adaptation to the cinema of Spiderman and everything that happened after began as a slow decline until becoming a total debacle in recent times. Mr. Dafoe is a masterful Green Goblin and his performance is obviously the best in the movie. He is good, very good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Spider Man was HELPED by a few other factors: Post-911 psyche of American audiences.  We wanted a feel good movie, and they gave us one. Next, Toby Maguire surprised me at how well he performed.  I never would've guessed this one.  Like Christopher Reeve, he came into a role no one thought he'd succeed with, and made it his own.  Overall, Spidey's an entertaining flick with SPECTACULAR special effects (CGI/ blue-screening a person in the swinging shots ain't easy, folks), but lacks a dynamic script.

This film shows a simple story, but technically it doesn't captivate me much. The visual effects I didn't think were very good and the villain was poorly explored for me. Still, this film brings one of the most classic characters in all of cinema and presents it to us in a good way, they manage to make a good story about a hero, and that is one of the main positive points.

Aged but still a great live-action adaptation.,"This is a very campy typical superhero movie but it does everything it sets out to do. A simple first theatrical depiction of the story of Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man that explains just as much as it needs to.People complain he's too awkward but I think Tobey Maguire was cast perfectly. In fact, the entire cast was great: MJ, Aunt May, Uncle Ben, Jameson, and especially Green Goblin/Norman Osborn. Willem Dafoe does a truly amazing job. He is the star of the movie especially with that iconic laugh.The comedy is pretty decent too. It got a few chuckles out of me.The fight scenes leave a bit to be desired with how far we've come in the 19 years since this movie released, but they're perfectly fine albeit aged.The ending with Peter denying MJ was super sad and genuinely makes you wonder if he'll ever get with her.In conclusion this is a pretty damn good superhero movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
one of the best original movies ever made,"""Spider-Man"" is a beautiful and indescribable movie. I loved it with all my heart. Now that I'm rewatching all the Marvel movies, I'm rediscovering movies that I didn't love before. This is one of them. I previously rated the film much less valuable than what I now gave it. "" Spider-Man"" is one of the most beautiful original films ever made, with an incredibly interesting and engaging storyline, with iconic costumes and unforgettable action scenes. The film is about Peter Parker, a loser boy who one day is bitten by a radioactive spider that gives him incredible powers and decides to use them for good protecting civilians from a major threat. The actors were incredibly perfect: between all Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe, without them I think the film would have lost a lot. Also Kirsten Dunst, James Franco and J. K. Simmons. The characters are incredibly written and characterized, with perfect and notable evolutions. In order not to mention the protagonists that it is impossible not to love, I name great characters like Uncle Ben and Aunt May, who are fundamental to Peter's mental growth. The film has a perfect rhythm, I have never been bored, entertains the viewer perfectly. For being made around 2000, it has great special effects and great CGI, with perfect photography. I loved the direction of Sam Raimi, who conceived perfectly how to make the film and managed to give both dramatic and horror tones to the film, and also manages to make people laugh. I also really enjoyed the love story that develops during the film and the ending is perfect, with a Peter aware of what the future will look like with his new life. The film gave me unforgettable emotions and is currently one of my ""comfort-movies"".This is the first masterpiece ever made by Marvel..

Spider-Man,"Tobey Maguire was always going to have a tough task revitalising this franchise - but I think he has done a decent job here. The geeky, shy, young ""Peter Parker"" bitten by a genetically-modified spider that endows him with superhuman powers, decides to use his newly-found prowess for good. Dressed only in a pair of loosely converted pyjamas, he polices the streets at night apprehending thugs and petty criminals whilst during the day he remains the butt of jokes and pranks at school - usually at the hands of school heart-throb/dim-wit ""Flash"" (Joe Manganiello). He is best friends with ""Harry"" (the handsome, but pretty ineffective James Franco) who is not only the son of mega-rich scientist ""Norman Osborn"" (Willem Dafoe) but who is also dating his own dream girl ""Mary Jane"" (Kirsten Dunst). When his board try to take the ""Osborn"" company away from him, Dafoe starts experimenting with drugs that transfer him from a megalomanic scientist into - well a megalomanic ""Green Goblin"" - and it falls to ""Spidey"" to save the city and, of course, get his gal. Maguire is engaging in this, he has a glint in his eye and he enters into the spirit of this light-hearted fantasy adventure well. The writing is good in places, if a little too earnest at times, and the visual effects work well. They don't overwhelm the acting - maybe because the spider skills are inherently a little less showy - and this allows the story to focus more on a few engaging characterisations. JK Simmons is good as newspaper editor ""Jameson"" and there are a few nice cameos scenes from Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as his uncle and aunt. Sam Raimi has kept the pace tight, there is plenty of action peppered with some humour, some ham from Dafoe and a decent amount of scary science to keep this moving along well for two hours.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the Better Comic Book Adaptions but not as good as the hype suggests,"I would like to say firstly I am not a Comic Book nut and have in fact hardly read any. But I do like Comic Book/Superhero Movies.Having seen a great many Comic Book Characters/SuperHeroes/Vigilantes brought to the big & small screens such as Darkman, The Flash, Batman, Spawn, X-Men, The Hulk, The Crow, Superman etc. I must say I did enjoy Spiderman and it was slightly better than I anticipated. I remembered seeing re-runs of the Nicholas Hammond TV Series in the late eighties when I was a teenager and thought them OK but a bit lame. I am not a fan of any of the Stars in Spiderman either (although I think Willem Dafoe is a good actor).I found myself thoroughly entertained from beginning to end, however that is all this movie is ENTERTAINMENT. The fact that Peter Parker is bitten by the Spider in the beginning and no-one else is, is a little hard to swallow, why does it not bite other people then we could have loads of Spidermen!(in reality spiders mostly keep away from people). But if you don't think about the what if's etc. and go along for the ride it thoroughly entertaining fast paced fun.There are the usual clichés, the mad scientist who must test his work on himself resulting in changes of mood and eventually becoming the villain (see The Fly & Hollow Man for other examples of this), the fight with the School Bully, and the ending is predictable.I found the romantic Scenes between Tobey Maguire & Kirsten Dunst to be surprisingly the best parts of the film, and also the scenes where Willem Dafoe's personality is being taken over by his alter ego The Green Goblin.Tobey Maguire's performance as Peter Parker was completely believable and having now seen him in the role I couldn't imagine anyone else playing it better, Kirsten Dunst was good as Mary Jane, I also though James Franco was good as Parker's friend and unbeknown to him the son of the principal villain Willem Dafoe, whose performance was as usual very good although a little over the top as the Goblin but this is the norm I guess with this type of film. I also thought Cliff Robertson was okay in his small part.I prefer darker comic book films and found The Crow, Batman (1989), Batman Returns and X-men to be better films.This Film is however is WAY BETTER than all the overrated Superman films (far too much humour)and The Hulk, Batman Forever, Batman and Robin, Catwoman, The Punisher, Daredevil, Elektra & Sam Raimi's own Darkman + all The Crow sequels.I would give this film 5 1/2 or 6 out of 10",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Quite super superhero flick,"I liked this movie in the early 2000s and was surprised it's still very good this day. Especially, when the Avengers-related MCU movies have become a pain for me to watch it surprised me even more that Marvel movies used to be this good.There is of course action in this kind of movie, but the strength lies in the characters. It's a very good drama and love story. Kirsten Dunst is perfect as Mary Jane, Willem Dafoe is an excellent villain, the newspaper guy Jameson looks like just from a comic book, and, well, the whole movie with its beautifully framed shots and vibrant colors looks what a comic book movie should look like. Tobey Maguire is a good Peter Parker and makes a good dynamic with Dunst (though I also like Andrew Garfield's version of Parker a lot).Special effects are quite good. There is some cgi but it's not overused, and generally the movie looks good.One of the best superhero films? See it!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It rocks!,"Pardon my language, but it does rock. It rules. It's beyond what I had imagined. After seeing a movie that fulfills almost impossible expectations, a little teenage language can be forgiven, I think. Let's not forget that Spidy is a hero with a cult following, so, naturally, there will always be those who see sacrilege in the few (good! necessary! favourable!) changes the creators of the movie made with respect to the original comic. To those: Come off it! This is a great film; it has the perfect balance of action, drama, laughs and the mandatory romantic element. And, of course, in this kind of event cinema, everything hinges on the right choice of a leading man, and in this aspect, Tobey Maguire is absolutely perfect (am I overusing this word?) as the slightly nerdish Peter Parker. As Auntie May rightly points out, Spiderman is not Superman; Peter's process of discovering and learning to control his powers are among the most hilarious scenes in the film (that spider web thing isn't as easy as it looks). Kirsten Dunst is as lovely as always, and Willem Dafoe would make a good Goblin even without the mask on. Speaking of the villain, not only are we given one whose motivations are understandable, but being who he is, he even opens the door to the sequel.All I can say, if the rest of the movie summer comes on as strong as this film, then we're in for a memorable year indeed. Not to mention the possibility of multiple sequels. 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Birth Of Peter Parkour Extraordinaire,"Based on the Marvel comic series, this film follows the successful film adaptations of ""Superman"" and ""Batman"". But whereas Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne assume their superhero mantles in adulthood, protagonist Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a teenager in high school at the inception of his superhero saga, so his alter ego likewise is a young man, and his is a coming of age story.Peter is the narrator and he tells us up front that his story is ""all about a girl"", so romance is integral to this film. We are introduced to the angelic-but-socially-needy Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). And the film launches into the origin story immediately, detailing the fateful day when our meek-mannered Peter's life intersects, improbably, with a unique arachnid specimen.Peter is given a competitor (James Franco) and an enemy/villain (Willem Dafoe). The story borrows heavily from traditional superhero/comic book lore, as well as traditional monster themes (see ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" and ""Frankenstein""). And stylistically the film is grounded in comic book graphics and composition, which serves to lighten the drama and inject an element of camp.""Spider-Man"" is set in New York City, and it often showcases known architectural landmarks to great effect, like the Chrysler Building and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This is something that couldn't be done in Superman's Metropolis or Batman's Gotham.After a screen kiss that is now iconic, I was disappointed by the last twenty minutes of the film, which are steeped in melodrama, undercutting the dramatic action.The ending is a setup for the next installment. A twist redefines Peter's love for Mary Jane in an unexpected way.Because of its comic book roots, the film does not require extraordinary acting, but the cast is solid anyway. Though we never feel the fate of the world is in jeopardy, there are real emotions at play and the actors deliver believable portrayals. Kirsten Dunst is especially good in her role as Mary Jane, which is necessary to anchor the entire film. J. K. Simmons, as newsman J. Jonah Jameson, gets to chew the scenery in a delightful way.This is certainly a strong first act for encouraging viewers to watch sequels.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"The movie is part comic-book wonder, part warmed-over ""Superman""","I know popcorn-epics like ""Spider-Man"" can't dwell over every little detail, but director Sam Raimi is so hectic and insistent on pushing this thing along, he loses the narrative punch in the F/X muddle. The movie is a big, loud, dumb entertainment, colorful on a certain level and lots of fun at the beginning--revealing a sneaky sense of humor--yet it becomes more staid and familiar as it progresses. Yes, Spider-Man is a super-hero and we need to see him using his powers for the good of the nation, but Raimi loses the beguiling magic inherent at the beginning while constantly pushing forward with 'bigger and better' ideas.

"Good, but not THAT good","I liked this movie. It is extremely accurate with respect to the comics and tv shows. But there is something about it that I just can't put my finger on. Perhaps it is Tobey Maguire, who was good as Spiderman but awful as Peter Parker. He needed to show more emotion. Or maybe it is the suits which looked WAY too cgi for some reason. Green Goblin's suit was messed up looking. Or perhaps it was Spiderman's webshooters that just appeared on his arms instead of him having to build them.Don't get me wrong, I liked this movie.

"Avoid if you're over 13, terrible adaption of Spiderman","I don't know where to begin with the mess I saw on the screen last night. I'll start with the acting. Tobey Maguire is a so-so Spiderman sometimes right-on, others just too goofy. Some really bad one-liners in this film. It looks like he's about to laugh when really he's trying to cry- bad acting in my opinion. Dafoe as the Green Goblin was good but the Goblin looked like a Power Ranger character. Dunst is the typical girl role. Kind of average looking but my does she have some assets. I could not believe what I saw during the rain-fight sequence. My lord, the theatre was filled with 8 year olds!! Still my favorite scene in the movie.The storyline & flow is what really puts this movie in the dumpster. Basically there are none. There's no build-up, the end battle just happens. Overall, a bad script & a bland story with bland acting. The special effects are great sometimes but horribly computer generated the next. Note to Hollywood: Please stop adding Matrix style scenes to every freakin action movie. Also, please stop with the ""we love New York, we love America themes"". We get it OK.

The good news - - I did not pay anything to watch it as the DVD was loaned to me!  The movie was rated much higher than it deserves. Most of the higher votes must have come from the younger viewers.

This is probably the most ""superhero"" movie I've ever seen, even surpassing Nolan's The Dark Knight. There's a compelling story, a classic kiss scene, classic lines, sacrifices, the main character is an underdog and I don't care about comic fans. They might like a Spiderman who talks more, jokes more, but this is the Spiderman closest to the real world.

"Entertaining, but cartoony and shallow","While spectacular when first seen, this movie does not age well at all. Even now, only four years after its opening, the special effects look dated and cartoony, and the story seems shallow and underdeveloped. It could be because of the release of much superior comic book films in that time span, or simply because the film dazzles at first and then begins to fade. Still, this is a very entertaining movie, albeit a bit cheezy and campy, which works at times, but not for the whole movie.Though the origin story is done very well - one of the best of its kind - the main plot of the movie is weak and pales in comparison. Part of this is the poorly done villain - not nearly developed enough, with a horrible costume to boot. Had the Jekyll-and-Hyde aspect been done better, the Goblin would have been much scarier, but now it just seems laughable. Speaking of laughable, the romance in this film is terrible - some of the lines are cringe-worthy, and it doesn't help that the actors are mostly wooden. Maguire is decent, but better and more believable as the nerdy Peter Parker than the amazing Spider-Man. Dunst is terrible, and unfortunately began the tradition of younger female leads in superhero movies. Dafoe is way over-the-top, but still enjoyable, and Franco is moody and unremarkable. Only J.K Simmons as the newspaper boss Jameson stands out, as he is both funny and true to his character.That's not to say this is a terrible movie. As mentioned previously, the origin story is very strong, from the original spider bite all the way until his superhero status. Though some of the drama is poorly developed, the comedic aspect of it is perfect, and suits the story perfectly. The action scenes are spectacular, and the poor CGI is only really noticeable during the close-ups. And the film is never boring, and tells its (somewhat weak) story well. So, overall, an entertaining superhero flick, but nowhere near the best comic book flick ever.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A Spectacular Start to the ""Spider-Man"" Trilogy","The first Spider-Man film is a great one. Marvel arrived on the scene in 2000 with the solid if unspectacular ""X-Men,"" but it was kicked into higher gear in 2002 with the release of ""Spider-Man.""Tobey Maguire is phenomenal as Peter Parker, bringing just the right amount of nerdiness, vulnerability, and most importantly, heart. As Spider-Man, he really seemed to be having fun. He is comparable to Keaton's Batman and Reeve's Superman.The supporting cast is very good. Kirsten Dunst is good as Mary Jane, and James Franco is also good as Harry. Other standouts are J.K. Simmons as Jonah Jamison and Willem Dafoe as Norman Osbourne/Green Goblin.Spider-Man's origin story is told quite well, and it moved along at a good pace. The film is very action-packed, and it is filled with the sense of fun that ""X-Men"" kind of lacked. Just the right amount of emotion is added to the film, and it also has a great soundtrack.There are a few cheesy scenes, but it is still overall a very entertaining and well-made superhero film. It was the kick in the pants that Marvel studios needed. Although this film would be surpassed by it's sequel, ""Spider-Man 2,"" it is still not to be missed.RATING: A-",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Saw the movie... liked the comics !,"My expectations were high, as I have been a Marvel Comics fan for many years.

WOULD I WATCH A ""SPIDER MAN"" MOVIE ???? What were the scriptwriters THINKING when they wrote this script ? One thin is for sure: They were not thinking ""marvel"" and ""super hero"".The tale of Spider man is a tale of desperation, hopelessness, broken hearts and despair in quantities that would make even ""Titanic"" look like a cheerfull comedy.

"A fun film, but could've been better","Spiderman was a fun movie. It had some good action scenes, and good performances by both Kirsten Dunst and Tobey Maguire, but I think it could've been better for a couple reasons.One reason is the special effects. I mean Spiderman looks like a bouncing ball as he jumps around and soars through the sky on his web. It just looked corny to me, and you could tell it was all CGI, except for one scene at night where he protects Mary Jane.The other part was the Green Goblin character. William Dafoe is a good actor, and he has a couple scenes here that were all right, but there were also some scenes where he appeared just as corny as the special effects.Also what about Aunt May and J Jonah Jameson. They appeared in the movie but had very little to do. That of course was improved in the second film, which is much better than this one.I'm not trashing the movie. I liked it enough to give it a 7 out of 10, but so much more could've been done to make it better. With the second one it was.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
what?,"I don't understand how this movie made the top 250, although it wasn't awful, it was boring, unoriginal and appalling as far as special effects go.

Most of the acting was respectable, especially from Dafoe who went a long way with his limited time on-screen and one-dimensional character (like most of the others) but Kirsten Dunst?

"The Spider-Man movie I always think of when someone says ""Spider-Man""","As someone who has read the original comics, I can very much see what all changes have been brought in this movie from the source material. And they have done it absolutely correctly. It seems better to see Peter Parker as someone who chooses to use his proto suit to fight in a cage match than to see him as a celebrity. The scene of Uncle Ben being shot down by a thug was really emotional to see, as he left the message for Peter - ""With great power comes great responsibility"".Peter is left to choose his own destiny as a high school teenager who has to deal with a death in the family, his career after school and being a new hope of humanity. At many points throughout the movie I felt that if I were him I would have been completely broken. But that's exactly what makes him a hero. He deals with all the situations and makes it look so simple.I even feel bad for Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin. He had worked so hard on his project but finally it was suspended. He was struck with grief and then the next moment he's the iconic Spider-Man villain. Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin looked way better than the comic counterpart. And his motivations were exactly like how we'd expect Green Goblin to be like.Spider-Man is one of those movies I often come back to see from time to time. I really like how the very first Spider-Man movie has set a benchmark for the future movies. It looks absolutely natural and has pretty good CGI for its time. The visual tone and colour palette are absolutely like an early 2000s film. It's a must watch movie for anyone starting to see Hollywood movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"A very enjoyable, yet flawed movie","Yes, another one. Spider-man stars Tobey McGuire as Peter Parker and is based on the comic book. Now, we have seen many comic book movies, but spider-man may be among more of the ""fun"" comic book movies.Of course, we all know what happens in the beginning. Peter, a nerd in school who is in love with the popular girl, Mary Jane, transforms into a crime-fighting superhero. Despite the clichéd beginning, the movie gets better. After the introduction of the hero, a villain arises. The Green Goblin becomes the bad guy after a science experiment goes wrong. Yes, another cliché.Okay, so the story isn't perfect. It is full of clichés. But, it does have its high points. Despite the fact that it is a comic book movie, it manages to add a few dramatic moments. Obviously Sam Raimi didn't mind adding some heart. (Spoilers) The final fight between Spider-man and the Green Goblin is also very satisfying, and ""cool."" (End of Spoilers) But, to counter the positive side, the special effects are pretty bad and corny, and therefore the action isn't as good as we would like it to be. It's pretty hard to hide bad special effects like Jaws did, (even if it was a malfunction) when Spider-man doesn't have any water or anything to cover him.Another corny part was when Peter was trying to get Mary Jane to fall in love with him. He doesn't give a very good speech.Spider-man is a pretty bad flick, but if you turn your brain off, it's quite enjoyable. I mean, it's a whole lot better than all of those darn chick flicks where the un-poplar girls get the guy and triumph of the popular girls.I, and many more people, prefer the sequel. I will get a lot of disagreements on this, but the sequel hasn't totally ridden itself of clichés, but it has upped the special effects, drama and lowered the cheese factor.6/10Good: Action, and many good scenesBad: Corny special effects, speeches and clichéd story",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Willem Dofoe as the Green Goblim is such a joy to see, he is hilarious and is probably one of my favorite superhero villains in cinema. This movie is so corny, that you honestly can't stop smiling. Superhero movies don't always have to take anything seriously, and this is a movie that is the perfect example. Also JK Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson is perfection. Whoever casted him to play the character should be a millionaire because he is actually the best thing about this movie.

Solid introduction,"Peter, don't tell Harry. With great power, comes great responsibility.The road to No Way Home begins with the original. I think I never watch the first two Spider-Man movies, which is a shame.This was a solid introduction to the beloved spider-man. Probably the best part was how Peter discovered and learned his power. It was funny and realistic, and I can see how later superhero movies like Shazam was inspired from this. However, I would have preferred for Peter to spend more time discovering his power, as I felt this part was a bit rushed, although it's still good.The character of Peter Parker was well done. He had a down-to-earth background and the way he tried to make money or do things to get his dream girl was both funny and somewhat relatable. His relationship with M. J. was also down-to-earth an cute, and I was rooting for Peter to get his crush.I'm not going to fault the action or the effects much since this was only 2002. The movie would definitely improve with better effects and I would have enjoyed it more.The Green Goblin was not a super stereotypical villain. Defoe was solid in the role with that iconic laugh. His interesting relationship with Peter will set up for the later films.Probably the best character was Jameson, played wonderfully by J. K. Simmons.

A Good Movie At The Time,When this film came out there wasn't much choice when it came to super hero films. I'd even argue that this movie helped the in the repulsive rise to mindbendingly boring super hero vomit we see today. With that said this film WAS good when it came out because of the lack of unimaginative superhero garbage flooding streaming services and movie theaters.If you watch the movie again it's obvious that this is just as bad as any other marvel movie today. At it's best the action scenes are decent enough for you to shut your brain off for a few minutes at a time. At it's worst it's a story about a woman who tears a friendship apart and a young man who's stupid enough to sell out for said partnership.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Perhaps quaint by today's standards, the timelessness and whimsy of ""Spider-Man"" help it excel.  It still stands as one of the most important comic-book movies ever made.","It's hard to believe it's been so long since director Sam Raimi reintroduced the beloved character of Spider-Man to film-goers with one of 2002's biggest releases. It truly was a magical time, and ""Spider- Man"" was very much to thank for this. Critically lauded and adored by the public, it was not only the first film to gross over $100 million in its opening weekend, but it was also the next big step in comic- book adaptations, ushering the public closer to understanding just how important comic books were and how much potential there was to make high-quality films inspired by these modern day myths. Films like ""Blade"" and ""X-Men"" were for sure the important first steps towards this, but it was ""Spider-Man"" that delivered on this promise, with its impact still being felt to this very day thanks to the rise of franchises like the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Yes, it is hard to believe how long it's been. Heck, the movie itself would now be old enough to be in High School just like Peter were it a person.Peter Parker (Tobey Macguire) is a nerdy high school student pining after his crush Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and dodging bullies with his best friend Harry. (James Franco) However, a school trip leads Parker towards a new and heroic life when a genetically-engineered ""Super-Spider"" bites him, granting him superhuman abilities. After the tragic death of his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), Peter chooses to use these abilities to protect the innocent, becoming the super-hero ""Spider-Man."" However, when Harry's father Norman Osbourne (Willem Dafoe) is similarly gifted superhuman abilities in a tragic accident and becomes the dreaded supervillain ""Green Goblin"", Peter will be torn as he will be forced to combat not only the father of his best friend, but a man he has come to greatly respect.Part of the great appeal is the lush and exquisite style injected into it thanks to the playful and thoughtful direction courtesy Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp's strangely old- fashioned yet appealing writing. The duo form a perfect union to tell the tale. Raimi- at the time best known as director of low-budget horror/comedies like the wonderful ""Evil Dead"" trilogy and quirky studio projects like ""A Simple Plan""- has a unique visual voice that lent itself well to the character. Himself a fan of Spidey's earlier comic-book adventures, Raimi is perhaps one of the few directors who was truly able to paint a film that felt like a comic come to life. With his wild and exotic camera-work, a fantastic sense of scope and color, and a sense of quirky ""fun"", it's just a wonder to behold, with such a magical and whimsical feel.Koepp's script is also a great deal of fun. As I said, it has an almost old-fashioned tone. It almost feels more akin to classics like Donner's ""Superman"" or Burton's ""Batman"" in terms of structure and dialog, with everything just slightly ""off"" of feeling modern, but in an appealing way. It gives the film a sense of timelessness. It doesn't feel a product of its time... it feels like the sort of film that could have been made at any time- the 70's, 80's, 90's... even now. And it's a big part of what helps maintain the film's freshness. As much as I enjoyed the 2012 reboot, it very much was the product of its time, and I find it feels more dated than this take on the character despite being much younger a film.The cast is phenomenal, and are also a major contributor to its high quality. For many, Maguire defined the character. He nails just the right tone as Peter Parker, playing him as the sort-of archetypal underdog you can't help but root for thanks to his kind heart and depth of character. He also made for a great web-slinger, though I will admit the humor and banter was lacking. Dunst is just a lovable female lead, even when the film doesn't go out of its way to give her much development or depth. (Though this film is very much Peter's tale, so I can forgive a somewhat cliché love interest.) Franco is a ton of fun and the seeds are planted for the future development of the character. Dafoe is just wonderful, nailing the perfect balance between flawed but good- natured father-figure and scenery-chewing madman from scene to scene. Robertson is a joy as Uncle Ben. And supporting roles like the fabulous Rosemary Harris as Aunt May are fantastic.Compounding this is an absolutely magnificent score by Danny Elfman. A legend in the field, Elfman's themes help to accentuate the visuals and lend a sense of grandiose to the proceedings. It nails the right sound of just borderline melodrama mixed with grand old majestic heroics. To this day, the opening titles still give me chills, and I still associate any depiction of Spider-Man with his themes in my mind.All of this praise being said, I can't help but admit the film has some flaws, which is where it does lose a point for me. Despite his structuring and sensibilities being great fun, Koepp's dialog is... a little too out-there. A little too manufactured, even for the quirky tone he and Raimi are going for. Some pacing problems are apparent, particularly in the first and third acts, leading to speed-up's and slow-down's that can be jarring. And even for the time, some of the effects were... sub- par. (It wasn't until about the third film that the CGI used on Spider- Man looked totally realistic.)""Spider-Man"" to this day stands among the most important superhero movies of all time. And this is thanks not only to the records it broke, or to the paths it paved for future films... but also very much for its quality and grand sense of entertainment.And it is most certainly worth a near-perfect 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Comic Book Film Yet,"While I do like the film versions of X-Men, and the first of both the Batman and Superman films, I have to say that Spider-Man stands out above all the other comic based movies.  I caught a sneak preview of what I believe will be the biggest film of the year, and it delivered. Tons of fast paced explosive action, and the story is timeless, and teaches many an important lesson as well.  Tobey McGuire was a perfect choice for Peter Parker/Spider-Man, and now I can't picture anyone else in the role.  And while not as memorable as Jack Nicholson's Joker, Willem Defoe is a great Green Goblin (just wait till you hear him laugh...it'll freak you out). Sam Raimi has just made his best picture, which is hard to believe seeing as Evil Dead 2 is genius.  This is a great film that many will see over and over again, and it is DEFINETLY going to give Episode 2 a run for its money. 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Unbelievable,"I had the grand opportunity to see a special private screening of this eagerly anticipated movie and I must say I was definitely impressed and I was in total awe. Not since the last superhero movie I saw was there a more and clear and complete followup to the comic book and this one was totally it which had me on the edge of my seat and hanging on for more. ""Spider-Man"" is a grand transition to what a comic book hero supposed to be and for a good reason. It sticks to detail and while it does that it keeps its audience hanging on for more and then some. The acting of the cast was very,very good and for Tobey Maguire's performance as the teen stud Peter Parker/Spider-Man was the best characterization I've seen in a long time since the days of Christopher Reeve(who was the last good actor to play a superhero and to be true to the comic book format).As for the story itself,it kept its pace with the origins of the story and the comic book itself was right on precise target. As for the villain,actor William Dafoe was electrifying as Spidey's arch nemesis Green Goblin and the battle between him and our web slinger is something to behold. Even the leading lady,Kristen Dunst was not bad as Peter's girlfriend who keeps his identity a secret,but she knows who he is. As the good point of interest,the movie is worth the price of admission. Even if you're a fan of the Marvel comic book or a huge fan of Spidey's cartoon series of Saturday mornings,then this is the ticket to get. Be prepared for the ride of the summer,since this one is unbelievable. Kudos to director Sam Raimi for doing this right and finally bringing Spidey to the screen!!!!NOTE: There will be two more installments to the Spider-Man trilogy in which Spidey goes up against his greatest enemies like Dr. Octopus, Venom,and Mystiquo and not to mention the deadliest of them all......

"Good, if not quite amazing","Sam Raimi's genre re-invigorating blockbuster holds up reasonably well. Maguire makes for an earnest and likable Peter Parker. He's not quite as comfortable with the wisecracking stuff as Spidey, but Raimi doesn't really focus on that very much here. Dafoe's a little hammy, but his performance fits in well with the tone of the movie. I found my self swooning over the sweetly vulnerable Kirsten Dunst, so mission accomplished there. And J.K. Simmons... Let me just say 'Whiplash' should've been his second Oscar (mild exaggeration, but he owns).The action scenes are a bit lacking in the thrills department, but the F/X work holds up pretty well save for a few noticeably dodgy sequences. And Danny Elfman delivers one of his least annoying scores. But what ultimately makes it work is its heart. Raimi gets the crux of Peter's journey--that with great power comes great responsibility--right (it's one of the many things I felt the reboot botched). As a result, the story and the characters all resonate emotionally",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best one yet,"I know that many regard Spider Man 2 as the best Spider Man movie to date (part 4 and 5 are on it's way, but not here yet). For me personally, Spider man does the job.

Tobey Maguire seems so perfect in his role, it would be a shame, if someone would replace him for future installments (even though in part 3, he seemed like a mess, I do think it was the script that let him down on that one).Of course we are talking Spider Man here and not Batman, so the Origin story is lighter and more teen/kids friendly. But having Sam Raimi at the helm of the movie, it still crosses some small boundaries. The story, the character arc, the beginning, the villain ... everything fits together. It's simple, it's fun ... and it even has Bruce Campbell in it! ;o)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant,"Superior superhero film with a perfect pairing of Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst in the leads. Dafoe is great as the Green Goblin, as Raimi manages to capture the essence and realism of Donner's Superman pictures. Brilliant 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spiderman A Good Comic Book Movie With Some Flaws,"Spider-man is a good comic book movie with some flaws. I prefer the sequel over this one but the original is still a solid comic book film brought to life by director Sam Raimi and the talented cast. Raimi does a decent enough job telling the origin story of nerdy high schooler Peter Parker into the web slinging superhero Spider-man. The cast includes Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-man, William Dafoe as Norman Osburne/The Green Goblin, Kristen Dunst as Mary Jane Watson, and James Franco as Harry Osbourne. Maguire is admirable in his role as both Peter Parker and Spider-man giving us character who is nerdy but is willing to put others before himself. He's a teenager with problems and I think thats why people can identify with him. He's also a man in love with his beautiful neighbor Mary Jane Watson. Dunst as Mary Jane is okay as Peters love but isn't really given much to do besides eventually being the damsel in distress later on in the film. William Dafoe is impressive as Norman Osbourne and his evil alter ego The Green Goblin. I like the fact they made the Goblin a split personality a side effect of the performance enhancers his character takes in the movie. His costume did look a little corny and it resembled something you'd see in an episode of Power Rangers or something but Dafoe makes for an imposing villain none the less. James Franco is good as Norman's son Harry but like Dunst he isn't given much to do either except to show up here and there throughout the movie. Rosemary Harris as Aunt May and Cliff Robertson in a small role as Uncle Ben are effective supporting characters. They both have good chemistry with Maguire making them believable as his characters aunt and uncle. Bruce Campbell has a brief appearance as a wresting announcer and he makes the best of his small part in the film. The special effects are state of the art and the action/fight sequences are well executed but at times you can definitely tell is CG which is okay but not as good as when you see two worthy adversaries without costumes duking it out instead of something created in a computer. The pacing in between the action was a little slow and the dialogue wasn't the best at times. Overall though Spider-man is still an entertaining comic book with just the right amount of action, some suspense, humor, a little romance, and solid performances by the cast that make for an enjoyable movie to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"It's A Bird, It's a Plane, It's-- Spider-Man?","Based on Marvel Comics' superhero character, this is a story of Peter Parker who is a nerdy high-schooler. He was orphaned as a child, bullied by jocks, and can't confess his crush for his stunning neighborhood girl Mary Jane Watson. One day while on an excursion to a laboratory a runaway radioactive spider bites him... and his life changes in a way no one could have imagined.Peter acquires powers a spider has... but the fun isn't going to last. An eccentric millionaire Norman Osborn administers a performance enhancing drug on himself and his maniacal alter ego Green Goblin emerges. Now Peter Parker has to become Spider-Man and take Green Goblin to the task... or else Goblin will kill him. They come face to face and the war begins in which only one of them will survive at the end.I don't know why I didn't like this film as much as everybody did. I think it lacked something. No, I liked the character's origins. No, not the action, since they were great with breathtaking special effects. Maybe they could have done more with the action or more with the villain (although I didn't like the Green Goblin as a villain).Everything good in the film isn't great, comparing to great superhero films like its sequel, Spider-Man 2 and 3, Daredevil, or Hellboy. I liked the action sequences in the film, and I liked the humor from some scenes.Tobey Maguire playing Spider-Man was relatively good, as well as Willem Dafoe and Kirsten Dunst. The score was good, as well as the cinematography. Maybe I was expecting more than they showed in the movie. This film was good, but it wasn't anything great. It fell short with my expectations.

web slinging at its best,"Peter Parker is a typical 18 year old who is smart, but is picked on by Jocks and is too shy to talk to the beautiful Mary Jane Watson who lives next door. Until the day he is bitten by a radio active spider, then the next day he feels different, he can sense things coming at him, he can spin a web, he also has incredible strength, and he can stick to walls. At first Peter decides to use his new powers for show, but after a terrible tragedy, Peter decides to use his powers to stop crime and help people, by becoming Spiderman. Then a super villain called the green Goblin is bent on mass destruction, it is then up to Spiderman to stop him. I enjoyed this movie because it had a lot of action and was not boring.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good start if not entirely perfect.,"Sam Raimi did give me a good time with my favorite web-slinger, so pointing out flaws in this first Spider-Man movie are mostly cosmetic or nit-picky.The set-up for Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man was more or less a by-the-book of his iconic comicbook origin by being bitten by a genetically altered spider and after that taking it to the wrestling ring to earn cash and facing the tragedy losing a loved one.That was well done and showcased how Peter Parker becomes a somebody instead of a nobody even if the romance with Mary Jane never really felt genuine to me. And that's probably my biggest gripe with the movie, because outside the standout performances from J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson and Willem Defoe's dual role as Norman Osborn and Green Goblin, the acting was only servicable.James Franco seemed bored most of the time as Harry Osborn and Tobey Maguire was pretty bland as Peter Parker, but actually convincing as Spider-Man.And that Goblin costume! Oh boy, how not scary can you be! It would have been so much better if Defoe had some make-up or effects turning his face green, because when you see him switch between Norman and the goblin in the mirror, you see some facial expressions to make your skin crawl. With all the brilliant special effects used in the movie, don't tell me they couldn't have done that.So yes, I have some problems with Spider-Man, but overall I had a good time with great action scenes and a couple of standout performances.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Way better than Batman,"""Spiderman"" was one of my favourite cartoons as a kid. Spidey was just the perfect combination- he could climb walls,he was strong,could fly with his webs and shoot webs from his hands. I used to think how cool that would be. So you knew when this got adapted to a movie with humans in it, I'd be one of the first ones in line (if a stack of nerds didn't beat me to it) The movie starts with Peter Parker (Maguire) on a school trip checking out an animal lab. Pretty soon he gets bitten by a mutant spider, causing a nasty bite and pretty soon some big side effects eg super strength and being able to shoot webs from his wrists. While this weird stuff is going on, Peter is still trying to woo Mary-Jane (Dunst), his cute next door neighbour. Peter soon becomes fascinated with his newfound skills and decides to enter a fighting comp. He wins, but decides he should dedicate his skills to helping people, not living large. When the Green Goblin (DaFoe) comes onto the scene, it's clear we have a good old good vs evil battle brewing.There's lots of twists, love triangles, relationship struggles and more that make this more than just a boring old comic adaption. Way better than the original Batman and it's predecessors. Worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Its OK but just too over-hyped...,"OK, first things first, this is not a bad film. It may actually have been quite good, but I seen it on the back of all this hype proclaiming it as the greatest comic book film ever made and a fantastic spectacle of special effects and this let it down badly.The effects are amateurish compared to other good CGI films and not a patch on the likes of Lord of the Rings, with the scenes of Spiderman swinging through L.A. looking more like a computer game than real life. I don't understand how it got Oscar nominations as surely the point of CGI is that you don't even notice it isn't real and this clearly looks computer drawn.The plot was OK and quite true to the comics but it just didn't grab my attention quick enough. I also found Kirsten Dunst a highly unconvincing Mary Jane. Toby Maguire is nerdy enough to play Peter Parker well and does a good job as the transformed Spiderman and Willem Defoe overacts superbly as Norman Osborn and the Green Goblin, but overall the acting left me feeling distinctly underwhelmed.Like I said, it may have been the timing and the very high expectations I had but I left the cinema feeling very disappointed, and as I was a fan of the comics and even the TV series in my much younger days and this just failed to fill the void of expectation.Worth watching on TV, but I wouldn't pay to see it....",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

If only all comic book heroes filmed this well . . .,"Spider-Man, the movie, knew what it needed to do and got on with it. As a sci-fi comic-strip action adventure adaptation this is one of the best. I am reminded of the tagline ""With great power comes great responsibility"" when I see how vintage director has handled the special effects. They are colourful, emphasise the story rather than their own technical mastery and have a beauty to them that is almost choreographed in its appropriateness. Tobey Maguire, irresistibly cast as the young lad who grows up to discover he is ""Spider-Man"" takes to the skies with all the joy of an adolescent with a new toy. Kirsten Dunst is melt-in-the-mouth as MJ. The transition from comic book to celluloid is effortless and an achievement within the genre, with the assistance of veteran writer David Koepp (Panic Room, Stir of Echoes, Mission Impossible, Jurassic Park to name just a few).

Hanging With The Big Boys,"From the web-woven opening credits to the last strains of the cartoon theme as the copyrights roll, Spiderman joins the pantheon of underpanted heroes whom the movie forum has portrayed as mightily as their bulging quadriceps (at this movie's release date, that being only Superman and Batman - the OG's).Directed by Sam Raimi and starring Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, James Franco and Kirsten Dunst's Breasts.Spiderman's new movie franchise ambassador had to win over audiences in his first 5 minutes screen time, or go the way of Leno-chinned Nicholas Hammond, the vacuous, Gilligan-hairdo nerd of the late-70s TV series, The Amazing Spiderman, which was as exciting as swallowing chalk. Tobey Maguire, running after his bus, browbeaten by schoolmates, lamenting in voice-over his teen-age problems, was a winner right outa the gate!An exhilarating feature of this film was the web-swinging (non-existent in the soporific Amazing Spiderman TV series, due to its technical difficulty). Movie technology has lent literal wings to stunts and visuals which were impossible in the days of Adam West running around with a Wile E. Coyote bomb over his head, or Reb Brown decimating the legend of Captain America throughout that whole ineffectual DOINK of a movie. Truly this is the correct era to begin making films of 'super' heroes, for only now can movie-makers convey a 'superiority' that George Reeves could never achieve by lying on a table and being chroma-keyed onto a swishing sky-scape.Aficionados may lament that there *is* a CGI jerkiness to the man-spider's swinging - but this nonhuman factor somehow only enhances the arachnoid element in this 'spider'-man. It's a letdown, yes, knowing that Tobey is not even on screen when Spiderman is barreling along, but it's better than watching 'crooks' with pencil-mustaches shooting at George Reeves with their hats on, while he poses arms-akimbo-legs-apart, then crushes their guns like the movie-clay models they are ('one-trick-pony' in the dictionary, there's a picture of George Reeves as Superman).In the 60's comics, Parker was bitten by a 'radioactive' spider  this was updated to 'genetically-mutated' spider, reflecting each era's fears and misunderstandings. The decision to have Spiderman internally generate his webbing seems more rational now, than his creation of web-cartridges in the 60's. It always intrigued me why Stan Lee (Spiderman's creator) balked at the webbing aspect, giving his young hero super-strength, an inexplicable 'spider-sense' and even the power to walk up walls (which should not be possible; stickiness of appendages is irrelevant, but rather volume-to-surface-area ratio allows insects this ability), yet no endemic webbing  a spider's trademark. (Spiders 'spin' their web via spinnerets located anally, so did Lee consider this and veto it?  and I suppose any superhero generating web from a butt-spinneret would lose most of the popcorn vote.)Who better to play Spiderman's greatest arch-nemesis, the Green Goblin, than Willem Dafoe? Face carved from crazy and body ripped like Jesus in crucifixion pose, Willem OWNED this role. The kiddies might have relished Norman the Goblin in his techno armor suit (a deviation from the comics, though definitely an improvement on the purple and green sexually-indecisive Halloween attire), but my favorite scenes were Willem battling the Goblin Within; when he was simply - like John Malkovich  Being Willem Dafoe.James Franco, as Dafoe's barely-tangible son and Peter Parker's almost-incorporeal pal, Harry Osborn, phoned in his role on a cellphone that kept cutting out. In the comic world, Harry wildly grabs the party reins when his father dies at Spiderman's hands, and becomes the second Green Goblin. By movie's end, Franco - in a valiant attempt to become three-dimensional - vows to make Spiderman pay for killing his dad, but I don't think any of us can visualize the fey Franco carrying the torch of Divine Wicked that came so rapturously naturally to Willem. Probably the biggest crime this wisp of smoke could perpetrate would be to join a boy-band and pretend to be The Hard One.Can anyone deny the integral role played by Kirsten Dunst's Breasts?; ubiquitous, delinquitous, nasty-perky, herky-jerky, firm yet forgiving, relentlessly real, cruel but fair. Remember, dears: when walking home from work, *always take the darkest alleyways and wear no bra*. Flame-red locks, sotto voce delivery, camera unable to focus on anything BUT those mounds of necessity, those pillows of slavery. Spiderperve has the advantage that most of us who wear dark glasses indoors gainfully employ: behind that mask, we KNOW what he's looking' at! After impressing her by kicking white-rapper butt, he hangs upside-down passively, allowing her to ease his mask off his mouth, in the same manner she would ease dark-nylon stocking from betwixt milky thigh, rain streaming down his roundish head, delineating her pinkish curves, as they lock lips in a tongue-roving, erotogenic, nerve-jangling, storm-driven kiss, rivaling easily the heat of Scarlett & Rhett in Gone With The Wind, or Rourke & Basinger in Nine ½ Weeks, and even Christopher Reeve and Michael Caine in Deathtrap. The subliminal metaphor was not lost on this disciple of heady foreplay: Fear, Sweat, Violence, Surrender. And all of it  WET. The Human Procreation Arc.Like the movie's slipshod ending, I have to wrap this essay suddenly (I've reached my word-limit, as Raimi probably reached his budget-limit). Kirsten Dunst's Breasts suddenly profess an irrationally-deduced 'love' for Parker, which is an essay unto itself, outlining the needless 'hope' this would instill in geeks who bag their comics who are NOT secretly superheroes: perpetuating the fantasy that a Pasty-Boy can Make Good if his Love is Real  well, boys, you'd better pray that somewhere out there, there's a radioactive ferret with your butt-cheeks' name on his teeth.(Read this review unabridged at: www.poffysmoviemania.com/Spiderman.html)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"couldve been a great film, but...","spiderman was so frustrating for me, because it was halfway there. it takes a script with dialogue and characters so ridiculous it begs to be presented as total fun, action-filled camp like the old batman television series. instead, the filmmakers took it too seriously, and tried to take a sophisticated approach, like the batman movies.the result is a confusing, relentlessy-mediocre film in which the audience doesn't know what to feel. everything is hybrid. you have peter's uncle, who is a serious character, then you have his aunt delivering camp lines like ""eviiil! eeeeviiil!"" you have a well-done spiderman costume next to a green goblin that looks a kids' action figure. is mary jane supposed to be a funny stereotype, or is the character just badly-written? we never know.people have blamed kirsten dunst for being a bad actress, but who could possibly deliver such lines as ""I better run, tiger!"" with any degree of competence? this is one of the dumbest roles ever written for a female actor of any generation. i doubt most respectable actresses would fire their agent if even offered the role, which is a throwback to the kind of girlfriend's you'd find i a 30s B-movie. i applaud kirsten for even trying.this is the perfect example of what happens to a script after its been through development hell. this movie had floated around hollywood since the 80s, too many people put their version on it, and the result is just ""blah."" neither good nor bad, this is the kind of movie you see and never think about again, or the kind you love as a child and then deny later on.no wonder James Cameron, Ang Lee, Jan DeBont and David Fincher all declined to direct the script. it really is bad. sam raimi, a very capable director, nearly saves it with his refreshing sense of style, but he didnt go far enough. it's not bad, it's not good, it's your typical 5/10. yawn.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Classic in Every sense of the Word,"Intro:Many might be baffled by the 9/10 rating I gave this film. Many call it dated, and not as good as you remember. But, I think this film is every bit as good as you originally recalled, if not even better.What I Love:While this film is very cheesy, it's the classic origin of our favorite wall-crawler. I absolutely adore the storytelling of this film, with Sam Raimi's charm all over this film. From the incredibly relatable character of Peter Parker, and how he transforms into a superhero. As we see both the origins of Spider-Man and the Green Goblin happen at the same in the beginning of the movie.And while many might call it stupid, or over the top. These characters live in an over the top universe.And the world building is perfect. I feel like New York is a person. As we see the people of the city on screen. All the extras in this film are so colorful and have so much character, even though they're on screen for meat seconds.And every moment of this film is so fun to watch. The action, while dated, is very entertaining. The character interactions, are very entertaining. This was a childhood classic for me, and part of the reason I love it so much, is because it's very entertaining.I also enjoy the visual style of the film. It's so energetic in it's look. Just by looking at the film, you can tell Sam Raimi made it. It is drenched in his unique style of visuals. It uses CGI very well, and while the effects don't hold up, I think it helps the visual flare of this film. The city looks like it's out of a comic book, with the bright colors and vibrant locations.But, the best part of the film, are the characters. Toby MaGuire is still my favorite live action Spider-Man. And James Franco plays my favorite Harry Osborn. And Willem Dafoe plays the seriously over the top Green Goblin, and I love the performance.Peter Parker, he is played by an at the time, twenty something actor. Feels like a real needy teenager. He feels relatable. And he is an interesting character. Many might say he doesn't tell enough jokes. But I'm convinced it grounds him in a way. As it makes him feel more real. If I was battling a super villain, I wouldn't be telling be jokes, I would honestly be terrified.Harry Osborn, while in the other films, often over the top, Harry is still a three dimensional character. As he was often not treated well and neglected by his father. And his story over the course of this series. And this is demonstrated so we'll, in several scenes. Like when Harry introduces his father to Peter, calling him Norman Osborn, really showing the disconnect between the two. And at graduation, Norman congratulating Peter more than his own son.Norman Osborn is a really fun villain. With a wonderfully over the top performance in the part of Willem Dafoe. But he's a very interesting villain, as he was a rich businessman, who from the surface, seemed like a normal person. But from beneath, was really a cold hearted monster, and once he was turned into the Green Goblin, showed his true colors.Conclusion:Many might pick at the issues with this film, the campiness, the dated effects, the over the top nature, and other things. But that doesn't stop me from loving this film and the other two in the trilogy, even Spider-Man 3. I will always love the film. It was a great superhero film when it came out, and it's a great film even today.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Well-done doesn't equal good,"I'm not saying I'm easy to please. And I will admit that this is well-produced. I won't go over everything in this that's potentially bothersome. They do get a lot in there, including the main point of the character. J. Jonah Jameson is perfect. May and Ben are pretty good. Maguire isn't satisfactory in my opinion, as either part of the role, though he is not as bad as he could be. Mary Jane is OK. The Osborns are fairly accurate. Dafoe's performance does bring up something important about this film, however; there's a lot of ham and camp in this. Perhaps not enough to turn a meat-eater vegan, or make you call your parents and beg to come pick you up, but it still gets to be *painful* at times. Also, the comedy... is it meant to be funny? It almost invariably isn't. The effects are generally nice-looking, although that whole thing about the actual costume of Spidey looking just like the CGI version... yes, and that's because it always looks fake, so it appears, in spite of that not being the case, as if every time we see the hero, he's animated. Plot is fine, and as an origin story, this certainly gets the job done. Pacing is reasonable. The action is cool enough, and the cinematography and editing are inventive and creative. Overall, this ought to please most of the audience, casual viewer and fan alike. There is a little potentially disturbing content. The DVD has TV spots, trailers, music videos, a comic/feature comparison, four special tracks for the movie, one with webisodes, a pop-up factoid one and two commentary tracks, one with Raimi and producers, and the other with VFX people, and finally the option to record one of your own.

Fun For Adults And Kids Alike,"Sam Riami's ""Spiderman"" is a fun comic book movie, but it is not a great onePlot In A Paragraph: Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a nerdy high school student who lives with his Auntie May and Uncle Ben, he hangs about with his best friend (and seemingly only friend) Harry Osborne (James Franco) and lusts after the girl next door Mary Jane Watson (Kristen Dunst) Peter's life is changed for ever when he's bitten by a radio active spider on a school field trip. Once bitten he developed an amazing powers and transforms himself into the superhero Spiderman. Unfortunately Harry's dad Norman Osborne (Willem Defo) has also developed some superpowers and he has transformed himself into the deadly Green Goblin.I had a few problems with this, the first being the menacing Green Goblin looked like a bad guy from the ""Power Rangers"" TV show and at times you could see his mouth was not moving when dialogue was coming out!! The wisecracking, sarcastic Spidey from the comics is nowhere to be seen. The ending borrowed heavily from the comic book ""The Night Gwen Stacey Died"" but didn't have the courage to actually go through with killing off a main character. Another problem for me was, I didn't find Maguire's Peter Parker/Spiderman or Dunst's Mary Jane that interesting. Willem Defo and James Franco were much more interesting as the deranged Father and neglected son.Now on to the good parts. Defo and Franco were both very good. The action scenes were well done, and for the most part the CGI is not that obvious. Cliff Robertson, Rosemary Harris and in particular JK Simmons are very good in their supporting roles. Maguire does well enough in both roles, and Dunst is attractive enough for us to understand Parkers obsession, and she plays a fine damsel in distress. I enjoyed Bruce Campbell, Octavia Spencer and Elizabeth Banks in their small roles.Overall not as good as it could have been, but still enjoyable enough.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I just can't put my finger on it. Maybe it's the fact that I expected this movie to truly amaze me, and my expectations were a little to high.Five years ago, this movie would've amazed me. That is, it would've amazed me because I didn't recognize bad movies. Five years ago I didn't realize how truly bad Batman & Robin was. I guess this movie was made for kids, but they should've thought about the teens and adults who grew up with Spidey and thought that maybe he grew up too.How could it have been better? Here are just a few suggestions:1) Don't change the bloody costumes or powers- the Green Goblin was NOT supposed to make me laugh, but it did. And what was the point of making web-shooting an integrated power instead of an invention?? If it came with the powers, realistically, it would come out of Peter's arse.2) Make the movie darker. It's too happy; Spider-Man is supposed to be a little darker inside. There was way too little thought about Uncle Ben's famous words: ""With great power comes great responsibility"". Spidey is supposed to be dwelling on this philosophy waaay more.3) It's a simple boy-meets-girl-and-falls-in-love-then-gets-superpowers plot, which even in the comics demonstrated little depth. I just thought maybe they could explore his uniquely teen mentality more, get into Peter's psychology. After all, his mind, flaws and truely human frailty is what attracted most of his fans.Overall, the film just didn't go deep enough. But this is coming from a person who expects movies of this caliber to be really, really good. Overall, this is an okay movie to watch with pizza and some friends, and that's about it. I must admit, it's interesting to finally see Spidey in live action, and it'll be interesting to see Doc Oc and the Lizard on film (and possible Venom or Carnage in the third movie, which I'm sure they'll make). I give Spider-Man a 6 or 7 out of 10.Hopefully they'll remake the Spidey movie in 20 years...I'll make it a personal goal to live to see a Spider-Man movie adaptation I truly love.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Already overrated, overhyped and just plain boring.","I knew from the previews that the movie had a campy 70's feel to it. It would have been OK with me had the movie not tried to take itself to seriously.There is cheesy love story that's been done a million times before. The scenes between Peter Parker and Mary Jane are the most boring to watch.Aunt May is a bland character. I laughed out loud when she screamed ""Those horrible yellow eyes!"" I chuckled during Uncle Ben's big speech ""With great powers come great responsibilities"" ooo wee!Why is Green Goblin wearing a Power Ranger suit? And what's up with Spider-man's voice? Sounds like he missed the puberty. Maybe Sam Raimi was not a good choice, considering how his ""Darkman"" sucked.Batman 1 and 2 and Superman 1 still remain the benchmarks for a superhero movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Spiderman cannot compete with Spider-pig.,"I had the privilege and honour of seeing this sublime movie at the this and that premiere, on Sunday the bla bla, where my mind was racing with excitement as the director bla bla gave a speech before the commencement of this cinematic feast bla bla and bla...No, no. Stop right there. This is not that kind of review.Instead, I will give you several reasons why you should watch Homer Simpson and his ""Spider-Pig"" rather than this or any other ""Spiderman"" sequel.1. Spider-pig is funny. Tobey is merely sleepy and boring.2. Spider-pig walks on the ceiling with grace. Tobey doesn't. He looks like an apathetic, clumsy 30 year-old moron impersonating a teenager.3. Spider-pig has a great sidekick: Homer. Spiderman has none.4. Homer's relationship with Spider-pig is far warmer and real than Spiderman's could ever be with Kirsten Dunst.5. Spider-pig has Danny Elfman's likable tune to follow his zany adventures. Tobey/Spiderboy has only crap commercial U.S. truck-driver rock to accompany his every sleepy move. (Note those always semi-closed eye-lids; rumours say 500 angry tse-tse flies stung him...)6. Spider-pig emits huge amounts of toxic excrement as a way to hurt his enemies. Spiderboy just shoots unconvincing CGI strings.7. Spider-pig is much more handsome than Tobey Maguire.8. Spider-pig is alert and quick. Tobey is drowsy and dull.9. The pig that plays Spider-pig is a much better actor than Tobey Maguire.The only aspect in which Raimi's Spiderman franchise beats Spider-pig is that Tobey's girlfriend Dunst is much better-looking than Spider-pig's sow mistress.The success of the ""Spiderman"" movies proves two things, first and foremost: 1) today's film-goers will watch any crap and love it, as long as it's hyped properly and sufficiently, and 2) Sam Raimi will never make another movie that comes even within light-year distance of his first two ""Evil Dead"" movies.If you loved ""Spiderman"", you must be either 9 years old or a...",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Big Budget B Movie,"This film has raked in a truckload of cash and a score of great reviews. Well, it seems that I'll have to be the exception. I didn't contribute one cent to this film's theatrical release and I am not about to write a glowing review of it.Spiderman is without a doubt one of the funniest unintentional comedies I have ever come across. This film has some of the most unbelievable dialog that has ever been put to film. It doesn't quite border on Ed Wood quality but it's the thing that keeps me laughing through the whole thing.The acting was so so but I don't blame the actors too much. With dialog that bad, the script couldn't have been much to jump up and down about.I wouldn't recommend this unless you like the 'so bad it's good' films like I do. And also there are some nice shots of Kirsten Dunce scattered throughout.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Classic Spider-Man,"When you remember Sam Raimi's 2002 Spider-Man movie, you can't help but smile. This is probably because now it is an unshakable classic, one of the first superhero films, of which there are now a dime a dozen. This is a film from childhood, which essentially determined the state of affairs for children's minds. It was simple. There is good and there is evil. There are no complications in the plot, dual interpretations of situations. It's just that there is a protagonist and an antagonist, and they fight each other, as good fights evil, so that one of them wins and thereby shows an interesting story.Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy with Tobey Maguire has generally become something bright and simple. And the first film in this series tells a measured story about the formation of a young hero and his acceptance of the fallen power and responsibility. The genre of modern superheroics has not even been born yet, the now famous successful Marvel Cinematic Universe and the less successful DC Extended Universe are not even planned. The just-launched series about X-Men is somehow remembered as a kind of comparison with the story of Spider Maguire. And it's even good. The viewer learns to understand the simple rules of this world, to accept the absolute polarity of the characters, to comprehend the laws of the presented universe. It is for this reason and the repeatedly complicated comic world of films, as well as the generally ambiguous surrounding real world with many existing truths, ""Spider-Man"" by Sam Raimi allows you to immerse yourself in one story of a young man who is looking for himself and finds it his duty to become a friendly neighbor for the residents of huge New York.The film came out soulful and intense. The few main characters allow the director, with the help of a competent script, to introduce us to all the actors and show their evolution in the allotted couple of hours on the screen. Tobey Maguire and his Peter Parker fit perfectly into the concept of the story. Already an adult actor has always seemed to me suitable for this role of a high school student. His manners, shy smile, true emotions - all this made it possible to see in Toby a high school student Peter Parker, who begins his growing up and transformation from an ordinary unremarkable teenager into a young man who learns to make adult and balanced decisions.Kirsten Dunst became popular at a young age, having played well in ""Interview with a Vampire"". And her appearance in Spider-Man once again confirmed that she is a great actress. However, in my opinion, the script did not particularly allow her to open up in this film. Her heroine Mary-Jane Watson appears as a defenseless girl who constantly needs to be saved by a famous hero, she sometimes looks like a trophy in the struggle between the young heroes of the film (Peter Parker and Harry Osborne) than a real person. And once again, I am sure that this is not the problem of the actress's game, but rather a scenario blunder or even simplification of her character.James Franco is also good. Let him really reveal himself to me in the third film of this franchise, here the young actor adequately shows the younger Osborne as a man who has been looking for his father's approval all his life. This is a complex character with his own internal problems, which are also sure to come back to everyone in future films.A separate decoration of the film is the actor William Defoe. That's who really pulls the whole picture. His Norman Osborn will give odds to any villain. Defoe, as always, is charismatic, bright and dangerous on the screen. You can't negotiate with him, you can't get away from him. He is purposeful, dangerous and incredibly attractive as an antagonist. Watching the actions of the Green Goblin on the screen is a pleasure. Given the complex family and friendly ties in this small circle of the main characters, the viewer is sure that even a family dinner is unlikely to be able to take place in a calm friendly atmosphere when such diverse characters are at the same table.Be sure to mention the kind of calm characters, which are Uncle Ben and Aunt May - relatives of Peter Parker. They seem to be the glue that binds together the whole picture, they represent the morality of this world and teachers, probably, for all the heroes and viewers. ""Great power carries great responsibility"" is a saying that, probably, both I and many other fans have carried and continue to carry through their lives. After all, these words are very correct and teach you to be able to be responsible for your decisions, especially when you are already becoming an adult and should be responsible not just for your actions and responsibility for yourself, but also for your actions and your family in trying to give her the best, as well as protect her from a bunch of different problems.""Spider-Man"" was born very timely. This is an ageless classic for my generation, a breath of that almost ideal and simple world that could never have been in reality, but that existed in Raimi's interpretation, when everything around was much less complicated than it is now. Then you knew that the world is much simpler, it is predictable. Now, when you look around, you clearly understand that the world is multifaceted and complex, it is much more difficult to do things in it, and the results of actions are unpredictable. This was taught not only by real life, but also by many times complicated superhero paintings, of which several dozen have since been released. In them, the world seems much more real and dangerous. And this fact also makes me remember the first picture of the trilogy about Spider-Man Maguire with special warmth in my heart. After all, this is a well-forgotten past, which sometimes you want to revive by simply re-launching the picture on the screen and hearing the first chords of the famous melody from the colorful screensaver.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spidey's first thwip onto the big screen is a spectacular wonder,"The time before the era of superheroes. Big Blockbusters were still trying to find a successful formula. Even Star Wars wasn't as successful as it used to be. Sure, movies like Blade and The Punisher came out but those were more aimed at Adults and still gained a bit at the box office but they weren't massive hits. Then in they May of 2002, Average moviegoers would finally see the worlds most amazing, spectacular superhero hit the big screen, spawning a new era of movie's to bust the box office. Directed by Sam Raimi and starring Tobey Maguire as the titular character, Spider-man follows the origin and first real challenge of Peter Parker and his web-slinging alter-ego as he deals with using his powers in normal life, and fighting his first super-villain: the cruel and dastardly villain of ""The Green Goblin!""
Spider-Man is one of my favorite superhero movies, mainly because it shows the right way to do an origin story. The first time we meet Peter is when he's about to get his powers, putting the viewer into the inciting action right away. After this beginning scene we see Peter's home life and eventually we understand his motivation and his decision to be a good hero when part of that home life is taken away. Despite his age at the time Tobey gives an accurate performance of Peter Parker, and a stellar one as The Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man.
The best part of this movie though is that it accepts its campiness and silliness as a comic book movie and uses that too it's advantage. This is most definitely best portrayed by Willem Dafoe's performance as Norman Osborne and the Green Goblin, staying a serious, worried, sympathetic businessman and Norman and entirely transforming into a cruel campy disastrous villain as the Goblin. While the characters seem entirely different, Dafoe does a great job linking them together and even makes the Goblin seem like part of who Norman really is.
The two of these characters hit their peak at the end of this movie, where we see Norman grieve and regret everything as the Goblin but he realizes it was his fault for it happening in the first place, and Peter learns that you can't save everyone, no matter how hard you try from (of all people) his nemesis.
I still believe that while Spider-Man may not be the objective best Superhero movie out there, it is the best at showing what a comic should be in a live action scenario and has a solid lesson to learn. While sure it may not be as Great as Spider-Man 2 or as ridiculous as Spider-man 3, it finds a good balance in it's characters, truly personifies the Amazing, Ultimate, Spectacular Spider-Man, and its influence can still be seen in Superhero movies- and really lots of movies- today, 15 years later.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The superhero movie that does so much.,"Ah, Spider-man more than everyone's favorite superhero, a role model to look up to, even in times of crisis. I was a big fan of the comics and cartoons growing up and I couldn't wait to see this movie in theaters when it first came out. It was so good I saw it twice. This is a lot more than a superhero movie, if you grew up in the early 00's as a kid or teenager this was the movie to the years of your life, the girl next door, your struggles in school and life in general, your triumphs, your pains, the enemies you face. Besides that, this movie was a ray of hope, released one year after the horrible 9/11 it showed how one person can pick us back on our feet and how strength of unity can overcome the most serious of obstacles thanks to one great quote late in the move: ""You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us!""

Not as good as it was spun up to be.,"I was rather disappointed by this movie. Once again I think the hype surrounding it raised my expectations too high and led to an inevitable anti-climax when I saw it.Don't get me wrong, it's a very watchable movie. Plenty of action and effects and with passable enough acting. Just not as good as it was spun up to be (sorry about the pun!)Nice to see Sam Raimi's trademark of action-comedy being continued rather nicely here, though. And it's always cool to see Bruce Campbell getting his usual cameo roles.I only hope that Spiderman 2 will not become just a simple action-fest devoid of plot.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The perfect example of Hollywood...,"Money.  This is all Hollywood stands for, and all it really cares about. Spider-Man's main goals: 1. Money 2. Money. and 3. Money.  I saw this movie on it's opening weekend, and left the movie theater with a bad migraine, and several regrets.  I could not comprehend what people found so great about this movie.  Yeah it had some good action sequences, and some fancy camera angels ( which was the main cause of my migraine ), but aside from that nothing special.  The acting is simply the actors reading off of que cards, and occasionaly smiling.  Despite the fact that Kirsten and Toby did go out during this film there was no chemistry between them at all ( nor anyone else for that matter ).  The plot is just plane unoriginal, and moronic. ""Uh oh my uncle died well I better go become a superhero, and save the world.""    However it is not the movie I hate so much, but rather everything surronding the movie.  The hundreds of hours of advertising,  the thousands of stupid toys,  the fact that the companys had to slap Spider-Man's face on every coke bottle, candy bar, and happy meal.  If you have read my other reveiws you can tell I'm not too partial nor fond of Hollywood, which may or may not ""blind"" my judgement.  Perhaps I have been a little too harsh.  The movie itself is entertaining, and you can easily sit through it many times over.  William Defoe ( I know that is misspelled ) is great, as always. Only he could act his way through the Green Goblin mask.  However I do not look at movies as just things to watch when I'm bored, I think of movies as contempary paintings, and the directors artisits.  That's why I did not like this movie, it had no real objective rather then $.  Over all it merits about 5 out of 10.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Fantastic,"Overall consensus on Sam Raimi's Spider-Man franchise?by you I only saw the third once, when it came out, so I don't remember it enough to actually judge it. But, rewatching the first two today I was reminded of how great they are. Raimi perfectly blends in cheese, camp, humor, drama, and action in one fantastic package. The comic book style is still in tact, and I noticed that unlike Nolan's Batman franchise, the heart is apparent here. These films give off a good-natured, mainstream vibe. The characters are all excellently written, and so it makes it so easy to relate to them. Raimi does so much with the source material in the way it's all edited together. The first two are honestly great and perhaps as great as something like this could ever be, so why why WHY reboot (remake) this after 10 years? There's simply no reason. It's not like the trailers for the new one suggested it to be darker, because these aren't dark and yet their dramatic moments hit hard.I hate to say it, but I do think that Raimi did more to this franchise than Nolan ever did to the Batman one. People like to criticize Nolan's writing, but I think the reason why his films' flaws are more apparent on rewatches is because of his direction style. Technically amazing, both Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, but as much as he tries he can't make the smaller moments count. Maybe it is his screenplays, or I simply don't know. My point is, after The Dark Knight people forgot all about these films (and because the 3rd left a bad taste). People like giving TDK credit for being dark and complex, and while it's true that it's tone is different than others of the sort, I think Raimi's films have a lot more to them. I simply just don't know why a reboot happened.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
cool,"""The Amazing Spider-Man"" swings into the superhero genre with Tobey Maguire donning the iconic red and blue suit. The acting, anchored by Maguire's earnest portrayal of Peter Parker, captures the essence of the relatable underdog turned web-slinging hero. The film editing, while showcasing Sam Raimi's signature style, propels the narrative with a mix of heartwarming moments and web-slinging action. The strength lies in the film's ability to balance the superhero spectacle with Peter's personal struggles, grounded in the message that with great power comes great responsibility. However, the weakness might be found in some dated CGI moments that remind us of the film's early 2000s origins. The music, with Danny Elfman's iconic score, adds a heroic crescendo to Spider-Man's swinging adventures. With a 7/10 rating, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" stands as a nostalgic leap into the early days of superhero cinema, capturing the spirit of a friendly neighborhood web-slinger.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

What a hype,"It's a usual procedure to compare newly spawned comic-book based movies with Burton's ""Batman"" and rightfully so as it is only a small step away from perfection. After doing just this I came up with the following:THE COSTUMES: Spidey's is great but the Goblin really does look like a badly done creature from the Power RangersTHE MUSICAL THEME: As far as I'm concerned one of the most important parts of a comic-book based movie. Well I didn't really expect Elfman to surpass his Batmen theme, but the music in ""Spidey"" is hardly ever noticeable and besides sounding very similar to much of his previous work, lacks in atmosphere and should have been much more powerful and striking. One of Elfman's worst.THE BIRTH OF A SUPER HERO: They wanted to show how ""Spidey"" came to be and I have no real complaints except for not making the most of it. The most enjoyable part of this movie for me was the part where Peter Parker is discovering his super powers. This movie was intended as the first of many so why didn't they take some more time to explore his newly given strenghts as they sure won't be able to do so later.THE VILLAIN: Oh please, anybody can wear a mask, if they decided to go for the cheap, move-free mask they could have at least made it cooler looking. Dafoe didn't do it for me, he seemed to weak and sympathetic-looking to be a worthy, let alone dangerous opponent.THE SPECIAL EFFECTS: They sucked in the trailers, they sucked in the movie. Some unnecessary scenes like the one where Parker is jumping from rooftop to rooftop are so bad I couldn't believe my eyes. There are some nice moments in the movie, no doubt, but even ""Superman(1978)"" , and notice the year of release made me want to fly. Spiderman made me want to kick the s..t from all those special effects ""artist"" because they did such a low standard job.THE ACTION: To be honest I don't really remember any good action parts since they were all ruined by the special effects. Mediocre at best.THE FEMALES: I don't find Kirsten Dunst to be very attractive, but she did an OK job. But I liked the kissing scene. Aunt May doesn't look like she's going to make it to the sequel.THE REST OF THE CAST: J.K. Simmons is the only one worth mentioning for his portrayal of the ever cynical and spider-hating Jonah Jameson. He looks exactly like his character in the comics and the cartoon. It's one of those lucky casting marvels(like Hugh Jackman's Wolverine)AND THE FRIENDLY NEIGHBOURHOOD HIMSELF: Well, Maguire's not bad at all, but as soon as an emotional scene arises I knew exactly why many people thought he was a mistake. He just looks so passive all the time and he has the most ridiculous cry, but I like his goofie scenes and expressions. Oh well, we're stuck with him for some time.I guess I didn't really compare ""Spidey"" with ""Batman"", but all those enthusiastic Spidey fans would probably be furious if I did because it would be tough to spot a positive quality.ANYWAYS, THE FINAL VERDICT: Although possessing some nice moments(all in the first half of the movie, where Parker is exploring himself) the movie lacks a solid (PG-13 free) script(and none of those ""We'll met again, Spiderman"" or ""You're out Goblin, out of your mind"". It's just not necessary!!!). I liked Raimi's ""Darkman"" much better, with all those cheesy effects and everything, because it had heart. ""Spiderman"" could have been spectacular, but wound up being a mediocre summer disappointment that earned itself over 400 million US dollars. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Amateurish,"I just wanted to start off by saying that after the release of Spider-Man, Sam Raimi seems a lot less talented to me than he did before. And the reason is that he didn't manage to ultimately have control over the final look of the movie. He gave the computer guys complete autonomy for all the action sequences and that ruined the whole thing. 'Superman' (1979) looked a thousand times more real (just because he WAS real).You can immediately tell when a shot contains digital elements, especially when Spider-man moves, where he is always a frame faster than a real character. You know why? It's because in normal speed it would be even easier to tell that the hero is a CGI guy. It's a real trap that only an extremely talented director can escape of. James Cameron or Paul Verhoeven could easily pull this off for instance.Anyway I am deeply disappointed because in 2002 we could do a lot better with a digital character who has no facial features and no hair.Sad...5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Get Caught in the Web.,"Very good superhero film that competes very well with the first two ""Superman"" films and the first ""Batman"" from 1989. High school senior Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) gets bit one day at a museum by a genetically-enhanced spider and his super powers are born. Meanwhile the very wealthy Willem Dafoe has performed a risky experiment on himself at his research lab and turns himself into a crazed maniac, with super-human strength, who only cares about world domination. Of course there is also Spider-Man's love interest (Kirsten Dunst), his elderly uncle and aunt (Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris) and his best friend who is also Dafoe's only son (James Franco in another outstanding performance for the youngster who has unlimited potential). Franco appears to become much more important in upcoming ""Spider-Man"" films.

This is the first superhero movie I ever saw all the way back in kindergarten/first grade when it first came out and I've loved it alongside my brother throughout my whole childhood, but as an adult I appreciate it so much more for its more mature, genuine aspects. It's not as perfect or full of heart as the second one in my opinion but I still can't deny they will never make a superhero movie like this again and this is one of the best first installments of a superhero franchise that will ever be made.

Solid action paired with heart; cheesy writing,"I'm not an avid comic book movie watcher. Having said that, I grew up watching the original live-action Spider Man movies. Returning to the first film of the trilogy after nearly 15 years, I see why I loved these movies so much as a kid. Quite simply, they're fun. The action scenes are a blast to watch. The effects still hold up for the most part, especially the practical ones. And the film clearly has its heart in the right place; this movie feels far from a soulless corporate project, which is a much appreciated contrast to the current slate of Marvel entries.The movie does have its share of flaws, of course. The art style, for instance, in which shots are framed like scenes from a comic book and transitions between scenes are also comic book-esque, is pretty neat, but it is inconsistent, to the extent that when these elements do appear in the movie, they are a tad jarring. Furthermore, the film could use some work in the pacing department. The film does an adequate job highlighting Parker's gradual discovery and mastery of his new powers, but his transition into crime-fighting hero felt rushed. His first successful fights against criminals and the public's recognition of him as the ""Spider-Man"" are reduced to a 1 1/2 minute montage.Lastly, the movie leans heavily into comic book tropes, for better or worse. I like a film that can embrace what it is rather than pretend to be something more, and I can say Spider-Man doesn't try to be more than a fun, action-packed comic book movie. I say this positively for the most part. My one big gripe is with the characters and the dialogue, neither of which can escape the cheesiness and cliche nature of... I guess I wouldn't say ""of comic books"" but perhaps rather of high school stories in which the main character is trying to win over the girl. There's a lot of that present in this movie, and it is the least engaging element. I don't feel anything for Parker and MJ's relationship (at least in this movie) beyond recognizing its cliches and chuckling at the cheesiness of some of the dialogue. That being said, there is no dialogue that significantly weighs down the film. It's good, it's serviceable, but it doesn't seem to want to improve upon the least effective elements of its source material.All in all, I liked it. I try my best to separate film quality from the nostalgia factor, and there sure is a lot of nostalgia to be found in this movie. I'm not afraid to say that a childhood movie of mine isn't perfect, and this one isn't.

Don't get me wrong, the whole 'Avengers Infinity Saga' is incredibly enjoyable, but seems to be based in a world closer to our own real existence and slightly less fantasy.In this film though, the use of a few more extreme elements - a quite camp Green Goblin, some corny lines and a camera filter that adds a slightly hand drawn feel to it, all seem to be just the right thing up against the everyday world seen otherwise.I actually love Tobey Maguire as Spidey. It's hard to pick between him and Tom Holland, because they are both so good, but I like the personality that Tobes delivers. I'm glad they chose to use him for the role and didn't opt for Leo as they might have done. There's a cute naïveté to him and he's got heart.Willem Dafoe on the other hand absolutely terrifies me and will never not be a source of nightmares.I do have to give credit to J. K. Simmons too. His portrayal of J. Jonah Jameson is superb and probably why they have used him in every incarnation of the web-slinger since. He's almost as iconic as the title character now.The special effects aren't the best, but they can be forgiven for the time that it was made. It's not ""Neville On The Broom"" bad at least. They're just a bit cartoony and somewhat computer game like by todays standards. It's easy to pick holes like that, when the technology we have 20 years later is so fantastically seamless and I'm sure that in 2002 I would have praised Tobey's CGI butt in his Spider-Man onesie.Fans of the comics that have read them from the start could probably list hundreds of reasons why this film is not right, but for me it's an easy and fun film to watch that is, for the most part family friendly. I know there was some indecision about its rating in 2002, but it's quite clearly a PG now.A great start to the Trilogy.795.55/1000.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

One of the Best Superhero Origin Stories Put To Film,"Spiderman is directed by Sam Raimi and stars Tobey Maguire as the awkward high school nerd Peter Parker. On a field trip to a science lab, Peter was bitten by a radioactive spider, and gained superhuman abilities of strength, reflexes, and heightened senses. He also now has the ability to stick to walls, and to shoot spider webs out of his wrists. When a new villain comes to town, a guy that calls himself the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), Peter must handle his nerdy high school life, all while trying to save the city and the girl he loves, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).Spiderman was one of the first Marvel films ever made, right behind X-Men (2000), and it literally made my childhood. I had Spiderman posters, bed sheets, window curtains, you name it. Spiderman was a very influential movie, and still holds up to day. People still love the original Raimi trilogy (or, the first two), and most like Tobey Maguire better than Andrew Garfield (no offense Garfield fans). This film is pretty close to perfect, and I'm here to tell you why.One of the best things this film can offer is the close to perfect casting. Although Maguire might not make the best Spiderman, he definitely fits the role of Peter Parker, the high school loser that can't get anything besides his grades right. James Franco as Harry Osborn was a great choice, and was much better than Dane DeHaan with a face full of acne. Kirsten Dunst was a pretty good choice for Mary Jane, although I could've seen some other actress dye her hair red and then scream for two hours. Willem Dafoe was an amazing choice for Norman Osborn, or Green Goblin, and handled that role with a lot of confidence and pulled it off nicely. However, the best casting choice was J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson. I truly believe that this was one of the best casting choices made in a film, ever. Simmons played Jameson perfectly, and was a highlight in every film, even the third one, but we don't talk about that.Another great thing this movie pulls off is the direction and special effects. Sam Raimi is a great director, we all know that, but he does even better in these films than in the Evil Dead franchise. His work with the camera brings a feel to Spiderman that nobody else, including Marc Webb, could handle correctly. Now, the special effects in a couple parts look somewhat dated, but overall, they are really good. Most of them still hold up today, except for a couple shots here and there.The score is also an extreme highlight of the film, done masterfully by Danny Elfman. Not even the great James Horner could replicate what Elfman did, when it came time to make The Amazing Spiderman (2012). The score adds an epic sense of liveliness to the film, especially in the action scenes (more on that later). The score sounds good with the film, or by itself, which really makes for a good soundtrack.Now, the action scenes were directed beautifully, and were very clean without an over abundance of cuts, especially the end fight between Spiderman and the Green Goblin. All of the impossible jumps that Spiderman makes, or when he swings from structure to structure look amazing, and this is all thanks to Raimi and his abilities with the camera. He can make a talking scene look nice, or he can make an action scene look nice, which is a great quality for a director to have.The best thing about this film is easily the vulnerability of our hero, Spiderman. Throughout the entire movie, Spiderman gets the crap beaten out of him, both physically and mentally. His thoughts are attacked, his body is attacked, his loved ones are attacked, and this is what makes the Green Goblin a great villain. He knows all of Spiderman's weaknesses, and he strikes them right where he should. This is where the film shines most, when the hero gets his butt kicked. This is because when the hero finally rises up to overcome the seemingly impossible hurdle, it makes the audience feel all that much better about his victory. This is common in all great films that contain a ""hero"", such as every film in the Dark Knight trilogy, Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), and even movies such as Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981).Now, the only complaint I had, and this is very nitpicky, is the suit of the Green Goblin. There's no way to let it down easily, he looks like a Power Ranger. Although the suit doesn't look bad, they should've gone with something a bit more realistic, and not just completely comical. If they would've done this, he wouldn't have looked like a Power Ranger, and he possibly would've looked as cool as he actually was.Overall, Spiderman is an amazing superhero movie, and an amazing movie, and one of the best origin stories put to film. I recommend Spiderman to anyone and everyone; it's worth your time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Overrated,I honestly thought the start of a Spider-Man sequel would always be great but this has proved me wrong. I get that it isn't as good now as it was back when it was first released but the lack of a good plot has put this movie in my 6/10 rating list. The villain of this movie was probably the best part of the film it was great acting by Willem Dafoe but it just doesn't hit as good as other spider man movie franchises. The acting from Kirsten Dunst sucked it's like she had a lack of spirit and inspiration other actors like Emma Stone and Zendaya played a better love interest for Peter Parker. That's my review for Spider Man.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
a great adaptation,"Spiderman did a great job in showing the ethics of what a superhero has to go through. He had people all over the city for and against him making Parker question, was being a superhero really it? Not only this, but the characters were great and played their parts beautifully.

Not all that it is cracked up to be...,"I must first admit that I knew nothing of Spiderman before I saw this movie. So comic book junkies can automatically disregard my review.  Seeing this movie as an impartial viewer, I thought that is was entertaining as a fluff piece, but lacked originality.  Those who have seen the Superman and Batman series of movies will have already seen practically every element of this movie.  I was hoping that Spiderman would provide something original, but was disappointed.  And I must add that many of the CGI effects appeared rather fake, quite a drawback for a movie with such a high budget.  However, the ending leaves it wide open for a sequel, and I can only hope that the second installment in this series will be better done.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The OG spiderman comic book perfection,"Sam Raimi's 2002 mega-hit is a once-in-a-lifetime, generation defining summer blockbuster, and in the eyes of this Generation Spider-Man-er, it's still the gold standard in superhero cinema.Spider-Man takes most of its cues from 1978's Superman: The Movie. Peter Parker's journey from unassuming geek to high-flying hero mimics the Man of Steel's in story and tone. The colorful comic spirit of Richard Donner's gleefully exciting original is all here, just Marvel-fied. Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp approach Spider-Man's origin with reverence for Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's original story. Koepp's script hits all the beats you'd expect (Spider bite, wrestling match, great power, and all that), but it also includes, unexpectedly, an intelligent, eloquent emotional foundation. Raimi and Koepp understand who Peter Parker is, and how his transformation into Spider-Man can metaphorically parallel his development as a character. In being confronted by new and strange spider powers, Peter is also confronted by the responsibilities of manhood. Koepp takes Stan Lee's best idea (That Peter Parker should grapple equally between supervillains and everyday problems), and pushes it to its logical max. Peter's infatuation with girl-next-door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is given equal importance to his struggle with Norman Osborne's manic alter ego, the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). The result is pretty well timeless. The quintessential Spider-Man story. A coming of age tale that gracefully weaves together every important aspect of the wall-crawler's mythos into a grand concoction of pure Spider-Man. Enhancing the story is one of the great casting jobs in motion picture history. First and foremost is Tobey Maguire, who was a revelation as Peter Parker/ Spider-Man. Like Christopher Reeve before him, Maguire completely defines the role. His Parker is a good kid; shy, dorky, and believably square. He radiates with innocence and later, teenage anxiety. As Spider-Man, he's delightfully charismatic. Lively, but never annoyingly brash in the way other Spideys have been. In the costume or not, every subsequent Spidey will live in his shadow. Maguire's casting was a stroke of genius, but it was no anomaly. Kirsten Dunst is a luminous MJ, and she and Peter's romance sparkles with charm. Willem Dafoe relishes his Green Goblin role, with a voice and presence that burn with comic book intensity. And the perfection doesn't stop there. The colorful supporting cast is just plain superb, with a legendary turn from J. K. Simmons as the hard-nosed newspaper man, J. Jonah Jameson, and two measured, twinkle-in-their-eyes performances by Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Uncle Ben and Aunt May.But Spider-Man belongs to Sam Raimi. A Spider-Man superfan since childhood, Raimi was destined to bring the web-slinger to life. The offbeat sense of violent fun and jubilant cinematic showmanship that made Evil Dead and Darkman so entertaining is precisely what was needed to bring Spider-Man's New York to dazzling light. And what a creation Raimi's Spider-Verse is! The tone, with a precarious balance of larger-than-life action and textured character moments, never wavers once. Raimi crafts in Spider-Man, a New York where the archetypical comic book mainstays: the cackling villains, the wise-cracking heroes, and the pedestrians who shout to the skies ""Look, it's Spider-Man!"", fit just as well as the richly drawn human characters. Raimi and the creative team behind the film's production design deserve the highest of praises. There is nothing else that combines style and realism to such astonishing effect. It's as if forty years of comics have been distilled into a real world somewhere alongside our own. Spider-Man is a captivating movie to look at. The action scenes are as fast and fun as the best of Cameron or Spielberg, but Raimi adds his own comic book punch, a kind of visceral razor-sharpness that leaps off the screen. The climactic showdown alone is as brutal, shocking, and frighteningly violent a movie battle as you will ever see. And when Spider-Man swings through the Manhattan skyline, you feel the exhilaration like you're right there with him. Despite a moment or two of spotty CGI from Sony Imageworks, the special effects here are world class too. The digital Spidey moves with a grace and elegance that would have been inconceivable just ten years prior, but digital or not, every time Spider-Man was on screen, I couldn't take my eyes off of it.Spider-Man showcases Sam Raimi at his exuberant best. Every frame of this movie is bursting with life. Whether it's the often gripping action scenes or the carefully crafted soap operatic drama, Spider-Man is an enthusiastic piece of crowd-pleasing entertainment, a passionate celebration of the Spider-Man mythos, and above all, a work of unparalleled quality. Blockbusters, especially superhero movies, with their all but guaranteed profits, can often breed lazy filmmaking. Sam Raimi and company fly in the face of that conceit. The filmmakers have taken the time to really craft this film. Wrapped up in all the soaring spectacle is something real; An enchanting love story, a poignant morality tale about becoming the man you will be for the rest of your life. Spider-Man recalls the kind of stand-up-and-cheer excitement that Hollywood has lost in the post Dark Knight/Avengers world of superhero movies. Raimi doesn't try to transcend the genre. Spider-Man is not ""more"" than a comic book movie, but through sheer craftsmanship, it is as perfect a comic book movie as can be made. I can't imagine that we will ever see the stars align in such a perfect way again. Spider-Man came together exactly as it should have, with exactly the right people, at exactly the right time for the world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
No buildup of intensity,"Overall, I was disappointed.  Special effects were nice, the acting at times was distractingly poor, but to be fair, there were some good scenes as well. By the 90 minute mark I actually started to get bored. Raimi had a good cast and a good script but I felt he didn't give enough buildup....and the climax was unrewarding for me....the film was just flat and the score didn't help it any.  I like Raimi a lot, but I think Raimi failed to give his actors, script, and Spiderman the direction they needed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Film That Revolutionized The Superhero Film Genre,"While Batman & Robin nearly killed the superhero genre by being a box office bomb that killed the original Batman film series, the year after would see it saved with the release of Blade, a movie that was a good mix of superhero and horror that, while bashed by critics, fans liked so much, that it would begin Marvel Comics' film success and opening the door to more superhero films. Spider-Man, the first in the Sam Raimi trilogy, would be the one to revolutionize the genre.Peter Parker (played by Tobey Maguire) is a teen who is bullied, but has crush on Mary Jane Watson (played by. Kirsten Dunst) and is friends with Harry Osborne (played by James Franco), son of Oscorp CEO Harry Osborne (played by Willaim Defoe). However, getting bitten by a radioactive spider while taking pictures at Columbia University's Science Department, he soon develops the abilities and powers of a spider. At first, he uses his powers for fame and money, even competing in a wrestling match against Bonesaw (played by Macho Man Randy Savage), but he soon becomes a hero after his Uncle Ben is gunned down by a gunman he let escape when he robbed the wrestling organization. This leads him into a battle with Norman, who becomes the Green Goblin by subjecting himself to an experimental serum and killing his competitors and even his own board of directors for trying to oust him from his own company.Now this is an awesome movie for something in the early 2000's. Already, the film makes it clear Peter's origin as the wall-crawling superhero is not going to be a happy one, keeping the origin story true despite some changes (removing the TV performance, but keeping in the wrestling part, even going as far as to get an actual professional wrestler, Macho Man Randy Savage, to play Bonesaw, and Peter does not have web shooters, as the movie changes his powers to include the ability to fire organic webbing from his wrists), but it stays true to the comics, and keeps the important lesson ""With Great Power, There Must Also Come Great Responsibility"" that Spidey is well known for. The actors all do a good job, and the films manages to squeeze in some cameos (Bruce Campbell, who starred in the Evil Dead movies, one of Raimi's earliest directing credits, appears as the announcer for the wrestling march), and the music done by movie soundtrack legend Danny Elfman helps sets the tone. But the best thing is the special effects, which while not as advanced as the MCU Spider-Man films, as it makes good scenes, like Spidey and Green Goblin's parade fight.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
ITS A LOT BETTER THAN STAR WARS!,"I am not much of a fan of comic-books-turned-into-movies, they've never really interested me (except maybe last year's X Men). I went in with mixed expectations, I'd seen reviews comparing it to Star Wars Episode II, and seen the two flicks go head to head in the ratings war......AND SPIDER MAN IS THE SUPERIOR OF THE TWO!!! There are some predictable/cheesy moments (re comic-book moments!!) and there is less action than I expected. There is also a lot less romance scenes to endure, but these are believable and suspension of disbelief is not an absolute necessity!The movie follows the basic plot line of the early Marvel comic books, where we learn how Peter Parker received his super powers and how he figures out how to use them. The Green Goblin I remember was this mutated freak/creature, not an 'ordinary' man decked out in corny-looking armor complete with really corny mask. His hover sled looked cool though.My only real gripe is the slowness of the story, I did expect to see more of Spider man's web slinging action and the villain wasn't really menacing enough.Anyhoo, for those who love C.G.I, there is plenty of that to look at. The C.G.I is used as a narrative tool to move the story along (Spider man and his jumping, swinging around) but doesn't devolve into a cartoonish, fake mishmash of events that drags on for 45 minutes or more. Lord of the Rings is a favorite flick of mine where the C.G.I was also used to its best effect!CONCLUSION?This flick is so much better than the boring, over-rated, over-hyped, cartoon-fest called Star Wars II! If Mr Lucas has not learned from watching the vastly superior LotR, he should at the *very* least sit down and watch this movie a dozen times to see how CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT *should* work!!7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
With great power comes great responsibility.,"Spider-Man (2002) is the movie that introduced me to the world of Marvel Comics and legendary filmmaker Sam Raimi. After watching this movie as a kid, I became obsessed with Spider-Man and I've watched almost every version of this character through the movies and various animated series. As an adult, I can still say that I love this movie.Positives for Spider-Man (2002):
The thing that I love and appreciate the most about this first movie is that it is a simple standone origin story for the character of Spider-Man. This was back when movie studios weren't crazy with the superhero and comic book movie genre or the idea of creating a cinematic universe. The movie does a fantastic job at telling the story that it needs to tell and closing out that story, while setting up things for a possible sequel. I love the musical score by Danny Elfman and it goes perfectly with the character of Spider-Man. Then, you have the cast of characters and the actors portraying them and they all do a fantastic job in this movie. First, you have Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker / Spider-Man and while he doesn't look like a teenager at all, he is awesome in this role and he is my personal favorite live-action portrayal of this character. Then, you have Willem Dafoe as the main villain to Spider-Man and he is an absolute riot in this movie where he can play the normal kind mentor to Pete Parker in Norman Osborn, while also being very campy and over-the-top as the Green Goblin. I also liked Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson and James Franco as Harry Osborn and they bith have fun dynamics with Peter Parker in this movie. You also have J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson and while he's not in the movie for that long, he makes the most with the amount of screentime he has and he is awesome. You even have fun cameos from Bruce Campbell and ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage. The movie has some fun action sequences with some great practical and digital effects thrown into the mix. And finally, I love the main message of this movie because it's one that a lot of people can understand and relate to in their lives.Mixed for Spider-Man (2002):
The movie can be very cheesy and campy at times, but that's something you should expect whenever Sam Raimi is involved with a movie's production. There are also moments between Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson that are a little awkward, but they feel appropriate and realistic to me. And finally, the Green Goblin's costume is very silly and looks like it came from Power Rangers, but it matches with the tone and approach to this movie.Overall, Spider-Man (2002) is still one of the best movies within the superhero and comic book movie genre. This movie is the reason why Spider-Man has and always will be my favorite of the Marvel Comic characters.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Entertaining flick that hits and misses,"Overall, this was an above-average effort at transforming Spider-Man the comic superhero into his movie counterpart. Given all the hype of the film though, I was a touch disappointed with this first part of a probable 3 episode series. It was entertaining stuff but at times the film seemed to fall between a romance/drama flick (emphasised by the nature of the ending) and a superhero action flick. Throughout Peter Parker was portrayed way too nerdy and besotted with the girl. Another actor -less geeky would have been a better choice than Tobey Maguire. There were too many sentimental scenes for this genre of movie- Spiderman's famous sense of humour was completely discarded-hopefully this side of his character will be developed in the sequel. I'd prefer this any day to the ""blubbing"" Parker that was seen here. The character played by Kirsten Dunst was iffy- portrayed as a materialistic, boyfriend-changing, Broadway wannabe who by the end is deeply ""in love"" with the nerdy Parker. This didn't really work and seemed contrived. The pacing was erratic at times - a measured build-up to develop the characters and introduce Spiderman...good, but then within seconds of film-time he's ""well known"" by everybody in New York City (this worked well in Ghostbusters '84 -but not here!) Also the Green Goblin character was a bit of a mystery-and what was with the ridiculous mask?! The best moments were when Spidey was in action- kicking ass,swinging through the avenues of Manhattan, posturing athletically- basically being a superhero. The special effects were good and Spiderman's acrobatics-enthralling, along with a mix of some really humourous moments and some great action scenes. The best characters in the movie were the ones who ""had character"" -Parker's uncle, Willem Dafoe's Dr Osborne and the newspaper editor Jamison. Look forward to Spiderman II.

Are you serious?,"Being a big spiderman fan, i was expecting one of the greatest super hero movies ever.  Boy was i dissapointed.  I can honestly say that this was the most dissapointing movie of all time.  First of all, during the movie, i kept telling myself that this was a ""comic book"" movie, and that the dialouge would be pretty bad.  I just kept telling myself that, and I can only tolerate so much.  But oh my god, there are so many dumb lines, I can't even explain.  Most of them are cliched, which doesnt bother me too much.... its a comic book movie.  But its amazing how many stupid things that were squeezed into the script.  My other complaint was the wrestling thing... with his costume.  If he had just appeared with his sleek, tight, spider man costume than that would of been cool... but instead they stress that he cant do that and make him wear that stupid nike clothes, and like a freeking ski mask.  Then all of a sudden it shows him wearing his new costume... Please someone tell me how he made it?  iF you know please email me...

A worthy adaptation,"Part of appreciating Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" is understanding its role in the Hollywood superhero boom of the last fifteen years. But on its own terms, what it really does right is the balance between morality and superpowers; the give-and-take of Peter Parker's crushing burden and those thrilling scenes of swinging through the city. That's what really stands out to me today (that, and J.K. Simmon's pitch-perfect casting as J. Jonah Jameson, who owns every one of his scenes). Not all of it works - the story is a bit drawn out and the dialogue scenes between Maguire and Dunst are marshmallowy soft - but it's a perfectly decent treatment of Spidey.And these days, I still watch it with the firmly-imprinted memory of its success in 2002. The genre landscape was entirely different back then, and a Spider-Man movie wasn't a sure thing. Raimi was a genuine surprise as director, but he produced a film that retained the vibrancy of its source material and populated it with grounded characters. And the timing really helped; it ended up being an anthem for a post-9/11 New York.In other words, it was a breath of fresh air.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Piotr St. says: CRAP! CRAP! CRAP!!!,"Omigosh!!!! How can ANYONE give this film more than 3 (except from TY and WD fans) remains a mystery for me.First of all this one is FOR LITTLE CHILDREN ONLY. I know that comic books adaptations are not meant to be, say, A Clockwork Orange, but do yourself a favor and go watch Batman (1989) - it's a great pleasure. Thanks to great director and of course Mr. Nicholson. And it still stands well: its dark mood, photography, and dark poetry have transcended well into 2002. In comparison this one is simply pathetic. Only special effects, and wery weak, naive screenplay.

There is nothing new, we have seen many films of superheroes and this one is simply re-make of all cliches you can imagine.I can't understand why this one earned so many money: I think it was because there were no good releases at the same time.

The Best Spiderman Movie To Date!,"This is by far, the best and most entertaining Spidey adaption there has ever been. This film was a very good Spiderman, I've seen all the spiderman movies and I still agree with myself on the fact that this is the best one there has ever been, I've not since this liked every single character in the movie. One of the best peformances I've ever seen Tobey Maguire is a phenomenal actor who is so talented, he is the reason I like this movie so much, he plays Peter Parker so well and I didnt want to see anyone else play him.Lovee my opinion or hate it, you cant deny how truly entertaining this masterpiece is and always will be. I think anyone who is thinking of watching this movie shouldn't hesitate and should watch it right away, I saw it years ago but its worth the review, amazing movie no spidey comes close.I highly recommend watching this, even if you have... watch it again!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Incredible origin story,"Spider-Man is an incredible origin story for the iconic web slinger that's wholesome, thrilling and emotional. Proving that comic book adaptations don't have to be cynical and grounded to work by fully embracing the more fantastical and ridiculous side.Tobey Maguire gives an incredible lead performance as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, full of hope, humour and optimism but also hints at a darker side. Kirsten Dunst and James Franco are both great and Willem Dafoe is a terrific and unsettling Green Goblin. J. K. Simmons is a note perfect scene stealer.Sam Raimi's direction is fantastic, a near perfect combination of blockbuster spectacle and scale with his trademark style. The music by Danny Elfman is superb, managing to be both inspiring yet also tragic. However, it is brought down slightly by the CG, which is quite bad at parts although there are some impressive moments.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I like it!,"I was born at the year this movie was released. So at first I thought this movie was a bit old-fashioned.

Superman's early years?,"While ""Spiderman"" may be the darkest, most morally ambiguous, (and probably the best), superhero movie since ""Batman Returns"" it's hard to shake off the feeling that it is nothing more than a reprise of the Superman franchise rather than something original and out there on it's own. Director Sam Raimi may have given the film the look and feel of a Batman movie, down to the sets and Spiderman's tight-fitting costume but his derring-do, his heroic rescues and his inability to tell the girl he loves who he is, all belong to ""Superman"".Tobey Maguire is a nicely oddball bit of casting as Spiderman. He makes the teenage avenger a more morally ill-at-ease character than an older actor may have done and Kirsten Dunst is a plucky, spirited, if under-written heroine but as the Green Goblin Willem Dafoe doesn't quite cut the mustard even if he does get the best special effects.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Very good introduction to Spider-man,"Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a nerdy high school student who has a crush on his next door neighbor Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).

Meanwhile Norman is desperate to prove his formula for human performance to the military. When he test it on himself, it corrupts his mind and turns him into the Green Goblin.Sam Raimi has created a very good introduction to Spider-man. The actors are all very capable and fit their characters. Willem Dafoe is amazing as Green Goblin. The only minor complaint is the web slinging ability.

"Not bad, but why on earth did this one break all the records?","For a comic book adaptation, ""Spider-Man"" certainly isn't a bad movie. The acting is good, the special effects are mostly excellent except for the extremely fake Green Goblin suit, and the whole thing stays very faithful to the comic (as far as I know, I haven't read too many of them). But it's also a very predictable movie. In fact, it's one of the most predictable movies I've ever seen: everything happens exactly the way I expected it would , including the compulsory romance story, which, although not as bad as the one found in ""Star Wars: Episode 2"", is still not very interesting.On the plus side, the fight scenes are often spectacular (owing a lot to ""the Matrix"", but hey, which other contemporary action film doesn't ?), and there are plenty of good jokes to laugh about.But overall, I really don't understand what's so special about this movie, why it broke all the records and why it's still in the IMDB 250. My guess is that it will probably drop out of it as soon as this flick gets released on DVD/Video.Entertaining and good looking movie with good action, but way too predictable.**1/2 out of **** stars",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the most ecstatic superhero events in quite some time,"Peter Parker is the awkward, neurotic, socially inept teenager, interested in photography, and crushing on the prettiest girl in school, Mary Jane Watson. During his trip to a genetics laboratory, where the class learns all about genetically altered spiders, Peter is bit on the hand by one of the arachnids that escaped and slowly begins to possess powers beyond his wildest dreams. At first, he realizes he can see without the help of his glasses, next, he notices he can leap heights and flip to great lengths, and finally, he starts to acquire the ability to stick to walls and shoot webs out of his hands.He becomes the notorious and infamous, Spider-Man, where he has proved to be a burden to some, but a hero to others in his hometown of New York City, where he lives with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris). After his Uncle Ben is shot and killed during a robbery, Peter notices the city is nothing but scum and is determined to take down the cities' worst in the form of secrecy. Meanwhile, his close friend, Harry's (James Franco) father, Dr. Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) is the president of the Oscorp manufacturing corporation, where they make and supply weaponry to the United States Army. In the mix of it all, Osborn becomes, what newspaper editor J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) dubs, the ""Green Goblin"" who pilots a glider, and serves as the villain to Spider-Man's hero.What inevitably follows is a series of unplanned and very physical battle scenes taking place with the backdrop of New York City skylines to handle it all. There's also a subplot, involving Peter, played effortlessly well by Tobey Maguire, trying to impress Mary Jane, played by the talented and attractive Kirsten Dunst, by relentlessly saving her from calamity and trouble by sweeping in at the nick-of-time while she is either being held captive by the Goblin, intimidated by muggers or even falling to her death. The catch is Mary Jane doesn't know this is Peter, but on the side, she talks to him at various points in the film. They've lived next to each other for years, but Peter has always viewed her as the unachievable girl next door and Mary Jane has probably always found Peter to be the unfortunate geek next door. How she doesn't recognize his voice when ""Spider-Man"" saves her an astronomical three times is beyond me. She should probably stick to staying in doors.No bother. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man is a fascinating and entertaining work of superhero fiction, collectively doing Marvel and all of its actors justice by blessing them with good material, a straight-shooting script, and action sequences that don't fail to impress. The kinetics and craft of it all are through the roof, and the twenty-five+ years the picture spent in development clearly was for the best. The film spends the first hour or so getting us acquainted with the man behind the mask, much like the original Marvel comics. We see Parker as a human, not an action figure, occupying a mask of uniqueness and power. The film shows the geek in the beginning, sympathetically, and then goes on to showcase him powerfully, where he is a placed in a role of certainty and bravery.Marvel comics were notorious for paying attention to the character behind the mask and the character in the mask. One thing Spider-Man neglects to showcase in its script and its main character is the agony and pain of it all. The second Marvel feature in 2003, Ang Lee's unfairly bashed Hulk, did a much better job at showing how a superhero's powers were more of a belligerent curse than a stroke of luck in a world of bitterness. Stan Lee infused his comics with so much life and enigma for the characters, plot progression, and the color of it all that the challenge to adapt it to film is definitely there. Raimi handles it appropriately and maturely, not becoming sidetracked with monotonous melodrama or overly-cutesy action sequences.The ones he does bring to the table are kinetic and stylish, showing off some of the most impressive photography and visual work of the year 2002, and brings two charismatic actors along for the ride. Spider-Man may not have the excruciating depth of Hulk, which created more cons than pros in the job of a superhero, along with establishing a sincere yet distant father and son relationship, but in its own right, it does so much in its two hours that you may need to stop for a breather.Starring: Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, Rosemary Harris, and J. K. Simmons. Directed by: Sam Raimi.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spider-Man Finally Arrives!,Though filled with pacing problems and a genre still finding it's legs Spider Man is a great addition to the pre MCU superhero genre.

2002 just may have been Stan Lee's annus mirabilis,"I'll admit that I've never really been into comic books (or do people like to call them ""graphic novels""?). But whether you're into them or not, ""Spider-Man"" is sure to blow you away. More than just a superhero story, it shows how, as the title character reminds us: ""With great power comes great responsibility."" As Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Tobey Maguire brings to the screen a superhero with whom we can all identify: misunderstood and searching for his goal in life. And Willem Dafoe makes one nasty, but cool, Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. Other cast members include Kirsten Dunst as Peter's love interest Mary Jane Watson; James Franco as Peter's friend (and Norman's son) Harry; Cliff Robertson as Peter's uncle Ben; and Rosemary Harris as Peter's aunt May.I also have to admit that around the time when this movie came out was the first time that I'd ever heard of Stan Lee (who appears in the movie briefly). Right before the release, he made a guest appearance on ""The Simpsons"" (the episode where Bart creates an online cartoon about Homer's mishaps). Two thousand two must have been a great year for Lee.All in all, you're sure to love this movie. I also recommend ""Weird"" Al Yankovic's song ""Ode to a Superhero"" (parodying ""Piano Man""), about the movie. Just great.

McGuire is Spiderman/Peter Parker to me. I don't think they could have chosen better. Kirsten Dunst makes a decent Mary Jane Watson, wasn't ever fond of her to begin with, but it's pulled off well.

Great superhero introduction,"'With great power comes great responsibility'. This quote stands like no other for this movie adaption of Spider-Man.Even before the hype around Marvel and the MCU went off, Sam Raimi managed to make Spider-Man suitable for the masses. It's a comic book adaption and that's exactly what it's supposed to be.The way Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man is legendarily staged. Always brilliant how Peter is called into the wrestling ring as the human spider in his costume he sewed together himself. Or how he tries to figure out how to use his net.First parts face the problem of introducing characters and their motives. Spider-Man manages that really well.Tobey Maguire as Spider-man is cult for me. He fits like a glove and embodies the human spider like no other. He is my favorite Spider-Man.J.K. Simmons is convincing as chief editor as usual. The few scenes with him are just fun.The fight between Peter and Green Goblin is also magnificently staged.Very successful prelude to the Spider-Man trilogy.

What's all the fuss about?,"I really do not understand the hype that surrounded this movie prior to its release.  Sure, the comics were good and the cartoon was always good when I was a kid.  But was this movie really that good?  Did it deserve to make $400 million in North America alone? God no!The acting was ok and I think McGuire was a good choice for Parker.  But the real shiner in this movie is Willem Dafoe.  He excells in these types of roles, and he pretty much made the movie for me.  Without him, Spiderman would be lucky to get a 5/10 from me.  The action sequences, now let's be honest, were few and far between and the special effects were absolutely horrible.  John Dykstra (of Star Wars fame back in the day) really should have stayed with Lucas' ILM.  I haven't seen very obvious fake-looking effects since the dragons in that horrible film Dungeons and Dragons. Spiderman and the G. Goblin looked like cartoons.Anyway, the two movies being touted as blockbusters this summer were Spiderman and of course, Star Wars Episode 2 Attack of the Clones.  The latter was a far superior movie, with a better story and MUCH better SFX.I realy don't understand how Americans can see Spiderman more than once, because that is what is necessary for a film to make over 400 million dollars in two months.  Repeat viewings for Spiderman? It surely did not warrant it.  An okay summer film, which I'll probably never watch again.

"Very good movie, so-so writing","Spider-man is a very entertaining movie. The special effect were great. Also, the major characters and acting for them was very good.Their are a few points that would have made it an even better film. The story plot was good, but the writing was only so-so. My guess is it was written by many part-time or temporary writers, using the recently more often used Hollywood pass-the-script add-or-change-a-little-more writing method that is to blame. Most of the secondary characters and some scenes were very two dimentional. For example when Peter caught his lady love AND all of the things she dropped, none of the students even noticed. None of the students made any big deal of him doing a somersault from a stand-still and then punch a quy twice his size clear across the room (except: ""Wow"", or ""Freak"").Also, when Osbone is given his walking papers at the board meeting, the whole scene and all ot the people there seemed artificially two dimensional and emotionless.Only other comment is that Spider-man's girlfriend could have been dressed a bit more modestly.Anyway, overall a very good, and fun movie.

The movie that introduced me to the superhero realm!,"It is one of, if not the most iconic creations created in the twentieth century in the comic book realm.Now, you may have your own preferences of who is the best Spider-Man, or you can initiate arguments over what universe does things better (This one or the Garfields's or Holland's). Still, you cannot deny the influence Raimi's Spider-Man had on millions of people around the globe. It had set the trends and inspired generations (especially those who grew up in the '90s and '00s), and that is something only a selected few could accomplish in their lifetime.And you know what was the reason behind this huge success? Although there were many, in my opinion, it was the simple story narrated in a simplistic fashion that did the wonder. There were no complexities, no grey shades to be found, and I honestly believe that made it more accessible and accentuated its already wider appeal.I am in no way implying that having multidimensional characters is a waste; they could turn out to be vital and almost always happen to be critics' darlings, but considering the fact the narrative demanded a basic approach, making it relatively more straightforward was clearly the right decision.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Jon Monsarrat review:  Better than X-Men, mix of good & cheesy","Let me start by saying that I am not a crazy-eyed comic book fan. I acknowledge that Superman and the gang are pretty silly and due for an update and revamp. Audiences have gotten a lot more sophisticated since the 1950s.Spider-Man has stood out as more modern and intelligent among comic heros. But so is Batman, and look what happened to his shtick-from-hell sub-intellectual movies. So, I was fearful but hopeful that Spider-Man would do better that the X-Men, which took a stab at deep characterization that didn't come off, and whose visuals and action were overly cheesy.Spider-Man succeeded. The first half of the film is a real delight, being the origin of Spider-Man. Tobey Maguire, who I enjoyed in ""Cider House Rules"" and ""Wonder Boys"", carried the film, and is destined for an Academy Award at some point in my opinion. The filmmakers pass up numerous opportunities to be cheesy, making it solid and real and making Peter Parker out to be a regular guy who's just so well-meaning and so down-trodden. Believe it or not, it brought tears to my eyes, and I'm not an emotional film-goer (got through E.T. dry-eyed).Unfortunately, the second half of the film devolves into the X-Men style campiness. I think there was probably too much plotting, trying to cram in a lot of the Spider-Man story, and in the rush it didn't have the emotional impact of the first half. Bigger, bigger, yet bigger stunts, but sort of haphazardly thrown together (who's responsible for that, the cinematographer?). Flying around, computer graphics, even shouting cheezy lines back and forth between good guys and bad guys.I was most disappointed in the acting by Kirsten Dunst, the silliness of the Green Goblin costume, and the city scenes which were obviously sets. Also, since there have been many Spider-Man enemies, it's a shame they chose the Green Goblin, one of the sillier baddies. I think they should have gone for the Octopus guy instead, or Kingpin.Overall, it was certainly worth seeing for someone like me with an affinity for comics. I doubt it will win the ""golden prize"" which is being a big hit with the broader mainstream, however.Who should see this film:-- Action film buffs who got through The X-Men; this one's betterand a whole lot better than any of the Batman films-- Comic book fans -- a must-see-- Tobey Maguire fans, but don't expect any deep romance.I'll give this film a 7 out of 10, the average of a great first half and a so-so second half.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An AMAZING spiderman (dvd),"Reviewing Spiderman makes me learn about a few simple rules about critics: # 1. Critics are subjective, because it is the result between The story and Our story. So Spiderman being my first big moment of entertainment in my childhood, its movie could only be viewed with tolerant eyes.# 2. Adaptation is a success if the «spirit» of the work has been understands. Thus, the pleasure for the fan is to live again this spirit, in front of a lot of little differences from the original work. In Spiderman, the spirit is indeed there: a loyal nephew and friend, a torn soul between his dreams and his duties. And the cast embodies perfectly the characters.# 3. The key to evaluate an adaptation is that not only the fans loves it but also the new comers. And I have got 2 friends who likes Spiderman whereas they didn't even read comics !!!! So, if the Xmen is too complicated for the non-initiated, if Superman is too perfect, if Batman is too dark, Spidey is really the Number one of the super heroes in comics and in movies!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great when not just remaking 1978 Superman!,"So.
The first act looks and feels like a normal late 90's movie from the time. There is nothing special. It's ok. The score isn't good. The acting goes from good to bad at random, and the dialogue is kind of weak.
Then we get the core of the movie (Uncle Ben scene) and that's perfect. Few comic-book movies justifiy so perfectly the guilt and heroic responsability for the main character. It's awesome.
After he gets to be Spiderman, the movie improves a lot and is motly pretty good with some exceptions. MJ ""love"" relationship with Spiderman is weak and unjustified. Why are Peter and Harry friends? Why is MJ Harry's girlfriend? The movie asks you to believe they all love each other, but we don't see it onscreen in my opinion.
Willem Dafoe's Goblin is... ok. Him trying to get to team up with Spiderman isn't though. Why would Spiderman join him? He's on a personal vendetta, even if Spiderman is a criminal, there is no reason for him to join in.
Whatever. The movie is fine, and the action sequences pretty great. The movie is funny, just not that great.Good movie overall, with great action, a great hero origin story, but weak and stilted dialogue, ok at best villain, and not always great acting.

No One Remembers the 1970's Nicholas Hammond Version? This was Better.,"My brothers and I never could figure out why so much was changed for the Spiderman tv show back in the seventies. Why does it seem to take a good forty years before an at least honest, faithful version to the original tale can be accomplished?Yes, some things were changed from the comic book, such as Mary Jane Watson and Flash did not go to the science exhibit (Mary Jane wasn't even in the origin back in '62) and Peter didn't create his web shooters, but now shot them straight from his hands. The wrestling match, crook at the elevator and Uncle Ben's death were all incredibly condensed together. As my brother put it, it was 200 comic book issues in one movie.But changes do take place for movies (it will be very amusing for adults to explain why Billy Dee Williams turns into Tommy Lee Jones in the Batman movies).A movie is only capable of showing so much before it becomes too long. Aunt May and J. Jonah Jameson had both been terrorized by villians, so naturally they were each attacked by the Goblin, staying true to the comic books in that regard. Major kudos to the man, J. K. Simmons, for his depiction of J. JOnah Jameson. Peter Parker became Spiderman in high school, so I had no problem with him being young again. If he aged naturally in the comic book, he would be ready for retirement now.Already the Green Goblin's arrival at the banquet is being compared to the Wicked Witch in the Wizard of Oz. And keep an eye out for an elderly gentleman with a white moustache and glasses in crowd shots with a small girl. It's none other than Stan ""the Man"" Lee himself.The movie itself made for a nice teen hero flick, the ending as to what Peter was exactly trying to say was vague (I got the impression it was striving for a Bill Bixby/HUlk bit), but this was a good flick. As long as the upcoming Daredevil and Hulk movies remain true to the origins too, there should be no problem there, but I don't see how Dr. Banner is gonna have his nuclear testing go awry when Rick Jones shows up on the field.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"nice, but only nice","Having had high expectations for this movie ( Having enjoyed the Spiderman comics without being a rabid fan ), I was rather let down by it  - cries of HERESY !!!! start now .Two reasons for this - the general pacing ( it takes almost an hour before the Hero finally gets his act together and starts swinging in earnest ) and the high amount of screentime the ""talks from the heart"" scenes take - especially the long and tortured talks between Spiderman(-to-be ) and MJ. Some crisp editing here could have done wonders for the whole movie. Its not really necessary to plow over the same territory repeatedly - even the daftest drunk will get the point that MJs family is broken, her boyfriend Flash is a classic idiot etc, after the first exposition - and frankly, I guess, the audience was not in the theater for a suburban sociological exploration.Second, the longwinded (if perhaps necessary ) introduction, which IMHO could have been much more easily done with ""flashbacks"" - Its a long time before Peter Parker discovers his abilities, and even longer before he starts applying them creatively. Hmmmmpf - I expected more in this regard from Sam Raimi of all possible directors.The costumes, set designs and camera work are on par, but nothing to remember as novel, impressive or breathtaking (like say, the ""bullet time"" sequences in Matrix ). I can live with the cybered up, armoured Green Goblin and never had a moment of disbelief seeing Peter spiderclimb up walls or swing and bounce through the streets like ""Tarzan-on-speed"".On the up side, when the story takes off, the effects are brilliant, the acting by Macquire and especially William Dafoe is great to exceptional ( I only say ""mirror sequence"" - hats off to Mr Dafoe ), the small walk-ins from and references to the original graphic novel are well done, and there is a strange, wistful humour around. Unfortunately - only until the next overlong and sappy exposition scene ( I personally found the scenes with Aunt May especially tedious - strangely enough the women with us found the MJ scenes ""stale""). Editing and pacekeeping are weak in this one, essential point. Sorry for repeating myself on this.Not bad, but could have been way better.6 out of 10 goblins",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

My favorite superhero action film of all time,"Spider-Man (2002) it is an epic Sam Raimi Action superhero flick! This first Spider-Man film become my favorite film of superheroes. I remember when this film come out in 2002 and become a huge hit that year. I kept watching and listening video spot Hero - by Chad Kroeger featuring Josey Scott. I wanted to see so badly that film that I bag my neighbor to get me that film and he did I watch it on Computer the same year that this film come out. And I love this film I love it not as much as I love Spider-Man 2 (2004) and The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) but I still love it. I am glad they made this film in 2002 and Sam Raimi directed this film. I love it and it is my favorite best Spider-Man movie yet. I watch it in 2003 my mom bought me VHS when she was still alive, she isn't anymore it remind on my teenage years in high school. I watch it yesterday and I still can't get bored with it. Green Goblin was the best villain ever in Spider-Man I love him. The Amazing Spider-Man was really awesome I love it so much. I love them all Spider-Man movies.I still find the original enjoyable, but I'm not nearly as forgiving of its flaws as some are. I think Spider-Man 2 was great, but the first one really is... crappy. I get it that it appeals to people by ""capturing that exciting comic book feeling"", but that isn't enough for me to say it's a good movie. The new movie has stronger emotion and had more weight to it, and I was RELIEVED that the ending was different. Yeah, it was a selfish thing on the new Peter's part, but I forgive him for it. A marvel movie shouldn't really go to much into the origin unless it relates to the story of the rest of the movie, if the origin is connected to the actual plot, then it's appropriate to show it, if not, then it's something you can get done and over with in the first 10 minutes or so, this movie is a prime example, the goblin wasn't related to the origin, so it went by quickly.I love The Amazing Spider-Man a lot, but my favorite movie will always be Spider-Man 2002 I grow up with that movie. Spider-Man 2002 is much much better for me then The Amazing Spider-Man is. Fans who compare TASM over SM are just kids and maybe they watch TASM before they even hear about SM or who knows why they do that, everyone has their own opinion. I love Spider-Man 2002 equal the way I love The Amazing Spider-Man:P That is my opinion .Average teenager Peter Parker is transformed into an extraordinary super hero after he is accidentally bitten by a radioactive spider. When his beloved uncle is savagely murdered during a robbery, young Peter vows to use his powers to avenge his death. Deeming himself ""Spider-Man,"" he sets about ridding the streets of crime, bringing him into conflict with malevolent super-villain ""Green Goblin.""The action, acting and pacing are excellent and the movie manages to action, romance, drama and comedy all into one great package! Spidey has always been one of my favorites. I was surprised that Raimi was given the role of director with this film, considering his only real claim to fame is the Evil Dead series before this, but his direction here is very well done. The acting is very good. Tobey Maguire IS Spider-Man/Peter Parker. Everyone fits into their role well -- great cast. The special-effects are okay. Raimi can't seem to decide what scene should be CGI or which should be wires when it comes to the antics of Spidey saving the day or duking it out with a villain ""Green Goblin"".The musical score was only part of the success for this movie thanks to Danny Elfman. The special effects were mind blowing for me to see Spiderman swing from high buildings to catch the bad guys. This movie is worth every penny and it is worth owning. Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson did a wonderful performance of her role. I seriously love the actress, I am a huge fan of her and I always was. She did played the character well, like the role of Mary Jane Watson was written on her skin.""With great power comes great responsibility.""Bottom of line I love this film and the fighting scenes between Spidey and The Green Goblin was awesome. CGI in this film wasn't bad It was great. The whole film was huge Entertainment.Spider-Man is a 2002 American superhero film directed by Sam Raimi.

A great start to the franchise.,"Having already proved himself more than capable of creating a fun comic-book style movie with Darkman (1990), Sam Raimi finally had a crack at the real thing in 2002 with Marvel's Spiderman—and he did a remarkably good job, delivering a slick, action-packed, major-studio, summer blockbuster that genuinely feels like a superhero comic-strip brought to life, with colourful cinematography, perfectly nuanced performances and the director's playful visual style very much in evidence (as opposed to those dreary Nolan Batman films that take matters far too seriously).Starring Tobey Maguire as the titular web-slinger, Spiderman is an 'origins' movie, and as such takes a while to get the slam-bang action, but the characters are so well defined and the script (by David Koepp) so smartly written that boredom is never an issue. I've never been much of a fan of comic book movies that dwell too heavily on the whole 'tortured soul' aspect of their central character (as in Nolan's miserable Batman films), and with Spiderman being one of Marvel's classic 'emotionally troubled' heroes, there was serious potential for this to be a rather joyless affair. Thankfully, Raimi handles the personal trauma in such a manner that it never drags the enjoyment factor down. This is pure entertainment all the way—a real corker of a superhero film that still has the power to wow well over a decade after its original release.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
watchable action fantasy undermined by unfaithful adaptation,"There are two ways to look at Spider-man. One is as a summer escapist movie about a teenager undergoing a startling transformation from nerd to superhero. The other is as the first motion picture based on the 40 year old comic book character.  In the first sense, Spider-man is a modestly entertaining summer action pic. The characters are sympathetic and there is just enough story cohesion to make the film satisfying. I didn't feel cheated, but I wasn?t anxious to step in line to see it again either. The dialogue could be mediocre at times, but no worse than some other films of this genre. There were some ridiculously melodramatic touches like the two romantic leads having lived beside each other for 12 years and never having spoken a word to each other but overall the film delivered what it promised. And that was all.But as a longtime Spidey fan I could find some other faults with the film, changes to the accepted history, which in one case actually undermined the film as a coherent drama.Sam Raimi demonstrated that he could visualize a comic book world like no one else with Darkman(1990), although that heavy-handed melodramatic film suffered from a cruel streak--as if mocking the trials and tribulations of the tortured main character. Echoes of Darkman are found throughout Spider-man. Nevertheless, I welcomed the selection of Raimi--until word spread that he had decided that an audience could not accept that a high school science nerd in an IMAGINARY, FICTITIOUS, LARGER THAN LIFE, COMIC BOOK-INSPIRED movie would be able to come up with mechanical webshooter devices--a trademark attribute of the comic book character and every television incarnation. Instead, they would be organic--existing as part of the mutation Peter Parker develops from the spider bite. Now, one could point out that developing super powers from a spider bite is also difficult to accept, as is the idea that a man from another planet who looks completely human could fly around in a red cape and shoot laser beams from his eyes. But alas, the decision was made. High schooler Peter Parker would have to demonstrate his scientific genius by... writing a term paper on nano-technology, and prove his creative genius by being a rather skilled fashion artist and costume designer! Some Hollywood apologists counter that we could not expect any screen time to the webshooter fabrication because of the length of the movie. Nonsense. A one minute-montage would have sufficed. No audience member would have walked out in protest. But the webshooter issue is actually minor in comparison to another change in the origin story. In the comics, Peter originally had no friends, and while he was interested in girls he did not have any particular crush. The decision was made to condense his social experiences so that his later friend Harry Osbourne would be introduced from the beginning(thus removing Parker?s status as a loner) , and to establish that Mary Jane Watson was his destined love(an embellishment not established in the comics until 20 years later). This latter change undermines the story of Peter Parker, devoting far too much screen time to the personal problems of Mary Jane as well as Harry, and creating an awkward moment for the film?s conclusion. In the comics, Peter was always concerned that some super-villain would discover his true identity and hurt his loved ones?-but the manner in which this is conveyed in the film?s final moments is problematic and left some members of the audience I viewed the film with wondering: ?Huh? After all that talk about how he loved her, he rebuffs her advances??One other change worthy of note:  The character of Flash Thompson is reduced to a one dimensional bully, in the comics he tormented Peter Parker but was actually Spider-man?s number one fan.The cast was certainly competent, given the material they were working with. Maguire and Dunst were sufficient in their roles, although i would not say that neither of them embodied the spirit of comic book characters. Maguire's Peter Parker was sympathetic, but subdued, lacking the introspection and expressiveness of his comic book counterpart(and as stated above, wallowing too much on his relationship with Mary Jane). As Spider-man, he did not employ many wise cracks and taunts, another trademark of the comic book and cartoon persona. Dunst's Mary Jane was well played, but her interest in Peter Parker was obvious from the beginning?a very artificial love story.With the exception of the final shot of Spider-man, the FX work relied too much on computer graphics that were not always convincing, and in some cases distant, detracting from an epic feel to the visuals.  The biggest design problem would have to be the decision to hide Willem Dafoe?s face under an expressionless helmet rather than make up prosthetics. It detracted from the performance in a couple of key scenes. And the music was truly  sub-par. Recycling the tv cartoon theme from the 1960s would have contributed more energy (although they did find a way to incorporate it into the film at one brief point).  Overall, Spider-man does not achieve the accomplishment of the original Superman, nor does it fall as flat as Batman.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Absolutely Amazing,"Sure, you can watch the newer movies and ""Marvel"" at the ever improving special effects but there is no substitute for this first attempt at modernizing the web crawler story.You will find sites everywhere, reviewing Spider-Man movies and pushing this one somewhere in the middle of the list. Completely inaccurate. First of all, I cannot possibly rank a computer animated movie on the same list as live action movies. Other than voice over work, there is no actual acting to physically compare. Who is responsible for bad physical acting in an animated film? The computer operator? Apples the oranges.Garfield and Holland have both played the web slinger since the original trilogy and garnered accolades for their portrayals in one forum or another. What makes Toby Maguire so much better is that, not only does he embody what we grew up knowing Peter Parker to be in the comic books and various cartoon versions, but he creates that character from basically nothing, other than those examples. Garfield and Holland both also had Tobey Maguire to base their characters on and, as such, both play as though they are doing a rendering of Maguire's work. But applying a little bit of the modern, aw shucks, airheadedness we've come to expect from just about every young male character in every movie we've seen for the last 10 years.Some reviews tend to State ridiculous givens like the storyline being unrealistic. You mean not as realistic as a person being bitten by a spider and climbing walls? Realism has nothing to do with superhero movies ever. Every time that appears as a detraction for a science fiction or action adventure movie, we might as well ignore the entire review because the reviewer obviously missed the point from the get-go.This film is extremely well cast with Kirsten Dunst perfectly selling Mary Jane, Willem Dafoe's, deliciously, way over the top Green Goblin and James Franco's Harry, Peter's best friend/rival pulling at all sides of Maguire's emotional range and Maguire handles the various dimensions of his character with aplomb. At least as much aplomb as one could handle a fictitious superhero character with. Aunt May and Uncle Ben are carried out beautifully and help to create the emotional moments of Peter's home life and the storyline is spot on.After seeing all of the Spider-Man movies from this one on multiple times, I still have no doubt this one was the best.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A good adaptation..,This was one of the first movies I genuinely remember as a kid. I really enjoyed it.

The new Spiderman films gap have me bored and almost walking out of the cinema.Andrew Garfield was tithe worse Spider-Man to date. No doubt that's why in comparison it did really bad at th3 box office. Now we've got Tom Holland. He's not bad but he just doesn't do it for me. What's worse is the stories are so silly. The Spider-Man franchise is just boring now. It surprises me though that the new Spider-Man films still do so well at the box office and ratings.It could be the people watching are children and they have low expectations and just seeing a guy in a costume is enough. I have no idea.This Spider-Man has everything.

"Didn't suck, didn't rule","I have been a fan of Spider-Man for more than 20 years, so watching this film while not being too critical over every detail meeting my expectations, was quite a challenge. To me, it was a roller coaster ride of kudos and de-merit points. Kudos on his costume, J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, the special effects of his webbing, the parade scene, and keeping somewhat true to the original story. Major de-merit points for the Green Goblin. He is my #1 Spidey villian and they made an atrocity out of him. Not only does his costume design bore ZERO resemblance to the original, it's also missing it's signature two-tone color combination of green AND purple.(For shame on you!) And Defoe's casting, along with Dunst, Franco, and especially Manganiello will always be a mystery to me. They look NOTHING like their characters. (That is, if you're like me, coming from the original Ditko/Romita Sr. versions)  As for bringing these comic book characters ""to life"", I can't say they bowled me over with their performances. On the other hand, there actually were times were Maguire would look a certain way and I thought ""Wow! That really IS Peter Parker!"" For someone who could care less about these details, this is an exciting movie to watch, and I must give them credit for taking it seriously, instead of approaching it as a big summer blockbuster with no plot or meaning. The only sad thing is, is that it wasn't ""special"". Like when you watch Star Wars. Spider-man is a very special character, with a special story to tell, and this movie, although it gets a A for trying, just didn't hit that ""special"" mark.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best franchise,"I'm extremely loyal to the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man series. In my opinion, there are no other acceptable versions, and I'd never even consider watching the subsequent remakes. Tobey is the perfect Peter Parker, and the movies are treated with such care and respect, they don't feel like traditional comic book movies at all.The first one is the origin story, and who doesn't love the first in a series when everything is explained and introduced? Tobey is the unpopular, shy high schooler who has a crush on the girl next door and lives with his aunt and uncle. Mary Jane, the beautiful heroine, is played by Kirsten Dunst, and while she famously dyed her locks red for the subsequent movies, she wears a wig in the first one. I prefer the shiny, lustrous wig since it's more vibrant and attention-grabbing. Rosemary Harris may retain her role as Aunt May in all three movies, but Cliff Robertson gets to deliver the immortal line, ""With great power comes great responsibility."" Everyone in this movie is memorable and important, and if you grew up watching this franchise in the theaters, your loyalty probably lies with them. J.K. Simmons seems like he crawled off the comic pages as the hard-boiled newspaper editor with hilarious one-liners. Who else can play the father-son Osborns but Willem Dafoe and James Franco, a pair of actors capable of being incredibly likable with a darker edge beneath the surface? Who else can endear himself as an unlikely hero who tries to atone and clean up crime in the big, bad city but Tobey Maguire and his innocent, expressive eyes?Obviously, the Spider-Man movies are going to have great special effects and thrilling action sequences. Whether he's battling the Green Goblin or merely testing out his new flying powers, you're in for a great, fun ride.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Spider-Man flies, there are some swift camera movements that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Oh... they made a comic-book movie...,"This could have been it... it should have been the best comic-book adaptation to film ever. But it isn't. Why? Because it's a comic-book movie. I thought that when you put together such a high budget and expectations on a movie you should be obliged to, at least, do something really great. Sam Raimi didn't achieve what he should have achieved. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad movie, it just isn't likely to make you believe that Spider-Man could be real. X-Men makes us believe that, Batman (the first two, that is) makes us believe that. Spider-Man doesn't. The CG character is only average quality for nowaday's standards and the acting is pretty basic. The plot seems to take a leap sometimes with no understandable reason and they have altered the comic-books so much that it hurts. If you want to make a comic-book movie you MUST obey the comic-book's rules. They made Peter Parker a wimp. They made him Clark Kent.

It may be a summer blockbuster but it's actually quite good,"Peter Parker is a dorky kid going through adolescent changes.  However in his case they are changes brought on by a bite from a genetically enhanced spider.  In a difficult lesson Peter learns that his gifts bring him responsibility.  Meanwhile the father of Peter's friend, Norman Osborn is developing a hover platform and strength enhancers for the military.  When he faces losing the contract he takes the treatment himself  creating the Green Goblin, who wrecks havoc on the city  with only Spiderman able to stop him.With some comic adaptations the end results have been disappointing (The Punisher, most of the Batman films etc), however here this is one of recent successes including X-Men.  It may well make changes to the original legend but it's really only things that'll annoy geeks who spend too much time on the internet arguing over whether Iron Man could beat Batman in a fight! The plot has enough to it to distract.  The creation of both Spiderman and the Green Goblin are enjoyable over the first half.  Peter's `experimentations' in his bedroom can be taken any way you want it!  However when the Goblin and Spiderman being to battle it is nice and simple  there's no plot to take over the city, no plan to freeze the world or any silliness like that, it's a simple battle between a good guy and a baddie.In many bits the effects are surprisingly poor  not as bad as I thought they might be, but still bad.  There are many bits where the computer characters don't look real  not just in terms of their movement but more in terms of their looks, in places it doesn't even look as good as the computer game.  Having said that, for most they blend effects and live action together well.  The Goblin's suit doesn't match the comic and it looks a bit like something out of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, but they use it well although one scene with him does look like something out of Godzilla!The cast are actually what makes the film.  Maguire makes a good Spiderman  he's a goofy looking kid and a good actor.  He doesn't have Spiderman's one-liners but he makes a good character, even when he's behind the mask he manages to bring a certain amount of humanity to the role.  Dafoe ran the risk of losing credibility by being a serious actor who goes for the money and get dressed up in a monster suit for a FX movie!  However he is actually really good  you almost forget how silly it could have been.  There are some really good scenes where he's facing his alter ego and it could have been daft but he carries it off  shows what a good actor he is.  Dunst is good  she really isn't much more than a Louis Lane character but she is good and her character has a good background.  My favourite character is J. Jonah Jameson  he's exactly like he's meant to be and is very funny in a hyper sort of way!  The actor who plays him (J.K. Simmons) is probably best known for his role in Oz, the HBO series.  If you know him in that, then it's weird to see the actor who plays, well, basically the Devil, playing this type of thing  but hats off, he's really good and looks just like the comic book.  The support cast has some famous faces  like Bill Nunn, Ted Rami and a few others, and it's nice to see Rami's favourite actor Bruce Campbell in a small role.Overall I must admit I expected to be let down but, apart from dodgy effects this is a good summer movie.  Plenty of good action and fun but also good performances all round.  The only problem I see is that half this film was filled up with creating the characters  what will part 2 do to fill that time?",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Questions about some lines,"The film was very popular at the beginning, and it was true that some of the structures of the film, as well as some of the functional structures, were in line with the rhythm of the shooting of small movies in the Hollywood era, and that comics had brought some very different things to that group of people from other graphic novels, that is to say, what was common in the comic era was that teenagers brought them some dignity. Come down in one continuous line. The style of the comics, the pace of the movies and the era of the movies and their era, the dignity and pleasure that the comics brought to the Americans, the skills that they brought to them, are all reflected in this film. Then I have something to say about this movie. He said that Batman is invincible. I feel very funny, because under what defense is invincible, I can defeat him. Who told me not to fight. The movie said that Batman was invincible and invincible. You didn't see that later Batman and other movies were not even as good as Iron Man. Some things about Iron Man clearly showed that his later movies were to show that Iron Man was more powerful than Spider-Man. The teaching of Iron Man and the status of Spider-Man and so on. Just to show that Iron Man is a little more powerful, so he is smart, so just think of what is invincible, what is invincible under the pillar. I'm not here at all. I like it, but I don't do it when I'm not here. What spider-man is the invincible God of war? I haven't seen any war later. I'm not. If I'm here, I can't fight. I scold him. I can't fight. We can't fight. I don't fight. IHe can't beat me, he can't fight me, he can't fight me. What endangered ah, invincible change of invincible, what is invincible, he simply can not beat me, but also invincible ah, war war is not invincible war, but I can not fight do not do not do not do. What thing, what thing, what war does not fight, invincible, invincible, fight with me, not do not fight, do not do, do not do.So Spider-Man is invincible. How can he be invincible? He can't beat me. Do you think he can beat me? He can't beat me. I'm not here. I can't do it.Spider-Man is invincible. How can he be invincible? He can beat me. If he fights with me, he can't beat me. So we can't beat me. He can't beat me. James can't beat me. He can't beat me. How can he be invincible? He can't beat me without being invincible, so he can't beat me without being invincible. What is invincible? He can't beat me without being invincible.Who chased you and let him fight with me? How can he fight with me? He can't beat me. He's invincible. He can't beat me. Invincible. I can't beat you. When I beat you, I can't beat you. I can't beat you. I can't beat my husband. I can't beat the horse. I can't beat you. You said that he could beat me, but he couldn't beat me.

Some things are dated and don't work as much as they used to and others weren't as good at the time, like the Green Goblin costume. However, this does not hinder anything, because the characters and the story are incredible and charming. Every frame of the film looks like it's been ripped from a comic book page. This film deserves to be forever a great classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
there is always ' hope for the best' in the next,"Finally I now accept the facts as they are now that I've seen the movie, what 10-15 times.The movie is big CRAP.When I saw the trailer of Spidey 1 I was so overwhelmed that my favourite comic hero was finally coming to big screen. But after watching the movie I actually changed by favourite comic hero from spidey to batman.The movie is very good, cool to watch FOR A 5-year old, stupid CGI with stupid dialogues. The only thing I like was JJ'a acting. Peter is good with his of-the-hand character. But as soon as he puts his mask on begins CGI Maguire. Peter when he puts his mask on grows, what 1 foot longer ? And what lame running in the balloon scene.  Peppy.Oh and the villain. Uncle Ben would have played a better villain than the masked marauder. In the comics the villain becomes a monster but in the movie he just remains the same ! Oh but in this movie I am happy that they chose to make him that way because with this type of stupid CGI he would have made another of those Hulk thingies.But the worst part of the film are the fights. Booorrriiinnnngg. Not one fight did I like and everytime a fight begins the audience with which I was in the theatre started booing after the second half.How could they just do so ? So injust. And they totally changed the beginning from the original comic. Peter actually meets Doc Ock in the first part .But where was he . O yeah in the second one. Now where will they incorporate HIM ?Everytime I watched the movie I hoped that its sequel would alter Spidey's future. But low. After watching the trailer I realised one thing. 99% will be boring stupid and filthy CGI .And for those who are able to recognise it will be another one in the basket, the waste basket.Well we'll just hope for the best, and pray they follow atleast some part of the original comics, shall we ?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"With Great Power, Comes a Great Film.","I must say that I was impressed watching Spider-Man. I saw it on the first day it came out, May 3, 2002. The plot was great, so was the cast, the effects, and the costumes! There are no flaws in this movie and I must give full credit to everyone who worked on it. Especially Sam Raimi who directed this movie brilliantly. I've got a gut feeling that Spider-Man II will be even better! Especially with Doc Ock. But too bad they took off the Lizard. He would've been awesome! Anyway, I'm glad with the rating that this movie got and Danny Elfman's score was beautiful. I hoped everyone else liked it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I have to stick to my original rating.,"I saw this movie in the theaters when it came out and I never wrote a review but apparently had given it a 6/10. Since I never rewatched it in the last 22 years (I can't believe it's been this long!) it was time to give it another go. And overall, I agree with my initial rating, though I might have given it an extra start for nostalgia, and recognizing this is the movie that really launched the era of superhero flicks as we know them (the original X Men that came before was a decent attempt but never reached that level). But some of the dialogue and acting is not quite there and does feel a bit dated now; also for the purists, the lack of web shooters is disappointing. I understand thy had to do some adjustments but I think the other versions that followed were better overall. We will see, as I'm embarking on a marathon to watch all the Spider-Man movies in order!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Two Thumbs Up.,"Spider-Man finally moved it to the movie screen and it was about time. The computer effects lived up to its end of the bargain and the actors did the best they could to make the movie a further success, but the action was left wanting. Not to mention the costuming of the Green Goblin was a joke and a half. For a movie that demands drama in its characters, where's that fair share in the action when we're sitting for two hours?Nerdy, anti-social teenager Peter Parker gets bitten by a radioactive spider. His world never becomes the same.Spider-Man's ""origin"" story stays true to its roots and everything is perfect on the comic side. Mess with Stan Lee's, ""With Great Power comes Great Responsibility"" moral and you're in big trouble. But the ferocity of the fights between Spider-Man and Green Goblin were terribly anti-climactic until the end when, even then, they were beating each other up instead of showing a good dramatic fight. In the end, it was good to see Spidey on the movie screen, even when dull at some moments.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spider-Man: The most hyped piece of trash available!,"I went to this movie with high expectations, but after i saw the Green Goblin or whoever that was, I lost all hope.

what a refreshing step back to a time of innocence,"What an odd way to describe a Spider-Man movie of all things huh? Well, let me explain.After I saw Spider-Man 3 in 2007, the disgusting display of incompetent film making and lazy attempts to make money and simply get by on the name alone, left me with nothing but a raging hatred in my core for everyone involved in that abomination of a movie. Watching part 1 again reminded me of how magnificent this franchise used to be. I can't believe these characters that I fell in love with- Peter Parker, Mary Jane, Aunt May, Harry, J. Jonah Jameson, are people that I actually wanted to commit felony acts of violence against in part 3 (particularly Mary Jane and Harry). It was so bad and personal, that I even said that if they continue making more Spider-Man movies in the future, that I would like nothing more than Kirsten Dunst NOT to return (a complete contrast to my views of her in parts 1 and 2, where I loved her). Seeing part 3 even made me second guess myself as to whether the first two actually deserved perfect 10s as I originally scored them. Well, seeing them again reminded me that they ABSOLUTELY deserve 10s, and that's why I'm writing this review. I'll stick to talking about part 1 here.**Great job adapting the comic to the big screen. They captured the campy humor of the comics perfectly, with lovable corny one-liners done just well enough to be corny, but not excessively that it becomes a joke.**At it's core, this movie is basically a love story about a nerd awkwardly trying to win over the girl he loves, with things getting a tad bit complicated having to deal with the fact that he's got superhuman powers. This is a romance story story running parallel to a superhero movie, and it's interwoven with expert craftsmanship, it completely engrosses you.**I've gotta give it to Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, they did some great acting here. All of their scenes feel so genuine. Who can't relate to those little moments that they had together? Like every time they happen to meet up by chance, they would say ""Oh hey!!!"" with a genuine look of surprise as their faces light up with happiness, followed by awkward, nervous conversation masked by their smiles, with Peter consciously making sure to minimize dead air in the conversation. Again, the most authentic thing in all of this is the ""oh hey!!!"" part. Not sure about everyone else, but in my experience, this is THE default greeting between a male and a female that are moderately close, upon unexpectedly meeting each other (less close could result in a simple, less upbeat, ""hey what's up,"" and more close could be running up and giving them a hug).**There's a certain *simplistic nature to this movie that you become fond of. There's a very dense, linear approach that pretty much forces you to love the characters, and want to see the nerd win the girl, and save the day.**If I had to do one thing differently, I would change the Green Goblin's costume. It was too over the top and cartoonish, they should've modernized the look, make it look like something that would be issued by the military for combat. They wouldn't wear a mask that looked like that..Parts 1 and 2 compared to part 3 are like day and knight. Regardless of The Dark cloud which is part 3 hanging over this franchise, these first two installments are the best superhero movies made in terms of pure enjoyment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

This Looks Kind of Familiar,"""Spider-Man"" is a very entertaining and well produced movie. The special effects are very realistic and seamless with the live action. But as I watched it, I had the feeling of deja vu.The story is simple. Nerdy teenager Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is bitten by a genetically altered spider and begins to take on the characteristics of the insect. He then begins to battle the forces of evil in the city and faces off against another genetically altered being called The Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe).The similarities between this film and the first two Superman movies is more than coincidental. For example, Parker is orphaned and cared for by an aunt (Rosemary Harris) and uncle (Cliff Robertson) who dies tragically as was the case with Clark Kent. Spider-Man battles the super human Green Goblin. Superman battled three super villains. Spider-man's rescue of the heroine Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst)from the top of a collapsing building is almost identical to Superman's rescue of Lois Lane in the first Superman movie. J.K. Simmons plays a Perry white like character called J. Jonah Jameson and so on.The boyish looking Maguire is surprisingly good in the lead role and Dunst is suitably fresh and innocent as the girl who loves Spider-Man but the one that Peter Parker can't have (shades of Lois Lane?)and veterans Robertson and Harris are good as the aunt and uncle. Dafoe on the other hand, is way over the top as the villain but then how else could he have played him. Simmons equally hams it up as the newspaper editor.Even though ""Spider-Man borrows heavily from Superman it is nonetheless a very exciting and entertaining two hours thanks mainly to Tobey Maguire.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

... oh please....,"Why is this the most successful movie in history all of a sudden?There has never been much of a buzz about Spider-man before, why now of all times? Personally, I thought the movie was entertaining, but it wasn't that good. The comic bookish lines such as, ""I'll get you next time Spider-man!"" and such may have been in the original comic book, but should have been left out in the movie. Nowadays, insults like ""F__ you Spider-man!"" would have been used, but this is a PG-13 movie. I found myself chuckling at a lot of parts in this movie. Whenever something pops up in a movie I don't like, I always make fun of it.Let's just say I have never made so many comments about a movie in my life. Sure, Tobey macguire and Willem Dafoe were absolutely perfect for the parts, they were the only saving grace for this film as far as I'm concerned. However, having Spider-man computer generated almost the entire movie ticked me off. Couldn't they have hired a chinese acrobat or something? Whenever I see an action scene that is in CG, (ex. Final Fantasy), I never feel any suspense or even the least bit of turmoil because it is all controlled by a guy behind a computer. My biggest beef is that the green goblin guy works for a company that created an anti gravity one man vehicle, a strength serum, and little spheres that disentigrate people and shoot blades out and explode. Please, is Hollywood this dumb nowadays, can't they contribute to the plot a little and at least have him acquire these objects in another way?My rating, I give it an 8 for entertainment, but a 5 for the movie overall.

Another problem I found, was that he didn't feel weird about the powers granted to him by the spider, or does he have to ""learn"" how to use them.  This was a crucial mistake, as I found Peter jumping from building to building with considerable ease, he didn't really have to try to hard to figure out how to shoot webbing, or how to master web-flying as well.

My all-time favorite superhero movie!,"This Sam Raimi 'Spider-Man' is in my opinion not only the best 'Spider-Man' film yet, but also the most perfect superhero film ever made. This film excels on every level.'Spider-Man is stylish, dramatic, thrilling, exciting... It contains a perfect balance of humor and heartfelt emotion, and a love scenario that is believable and relevant. Danny Elfman's score is fantastic, and the visuals are dynamic.It is a classic tale of a nerd, Peter parker, who becomes a hero - and is brilliantly portrayed by Tobey MaGuire. Tobey really owns the character, and he is still my favorite Spider-Man. Parker's transition from ordinary guy to Spider-man is incredibly well done. Willem Dafoe is also very good as the antagonist, Norman Osborn. The circumstances and events leading to him becoming the villain, Green Goblin, is well set-up.Kirsten Dunst stars as Parker's distant love interest, and James Franco as his best friend, Harry Osborn. There's so much character development during the course of the film between these three main stars. JK Simmons is hilarious as Mr Jameson. I absolutely love him in this role!'Spider-Man' is an emotional action adventure fantasy with a great script, great characters and awesome action sequences. The film also so well illustrates how one wrong decision can change your fate, and those around you. This is so much more than just a superhero movie.

"The best ""Spiderman"" film by far.","This was the film that proved an adaptation of a ""Marvel Comic"" superhero could be made. This first ""Spiderman"" film was the first of its kind and set the course for all future superhero movies. There is a story that actually holds the film together and backed by some good dialogue, good directing and pretty good acting. Where better than to begin with the origins of Spiderman? As has been depicted many times, high school student Peter Parker is bitten by a spider that just happens to be radioactive during a guided tour of a New York science museum. Initially overcome by his newly acquired superpowers, Parker attempts to cash in by appearing as a wrestler and on prime time television. After all this is met with failure, disaster strikes as Parkers Uncle Ben is murdered in cold blood by a thief. Cliff Robertson was brilliantly cast as the uncle. The story doesn't just revolve around Spiderman/Peter Parker though. Elsewhere in the film, business tycoon and inventor Norman Osborn (well played by Willam Defoe), suffers from an accident in his own laboratory after an experiment goes wrong. Thus the Green Goblin is unleashed. I was a bit disappointed with the costume for the Green Goblin, it held none of the appeal or chilling factor that the comic books had. Peter Parker struggles with his growing feelings for the girl that he has liked since childhood - Mary Jane Watson. The task of expressing his feelings has been rendered even more difficult on account of his crime- fighting alter ego. Toby Maguire is pretty good in the main role but I wouldn't exactly call him a heavyweight actor. He can't project the rugged look that action men need. Even so, he fits the bill. The scenes that show Spiderman web-slinging his way around New York look great and the CGI serves its purpose without compromising the story.

An Open Letter to Sam Raimi,"Dear Mr. Raimi,You hack.  You won me over with the Evil Dead films, showed true promise with ""For Love of the Game,"" and showed a true director's gift with ""A Simple Plan.""  What the hell happened?Mostly, I suppose we can blame the script.  David Koepp has never had a fond place in my heart, and yes, while he did write the very good ""Panic Room,"" the script itself was just okay, it was the director that made that movie. Ditto for ""Jurassic Park,"" and anyone who says differently needs to go back and watch that flick again.  For the second Jurassic Park alone, Mr. Koepp should be run out of town on a rail.Was it the studio pressure?  I can sure see how it got to Mr. Burton on that ridiculous ""Planet of the Apes"" remake.  Notice, now that the film is all done, and surely making the studio lots of money (all they really care about anyway, so anything said after Opening Day is incidental, right?  WRONG!)... notice how you wimped out, and screwed up a wonderful opportunity:Peter Parker gets cool spider powers.  Neat-o.  His skin allows him to cling to walls, tiny little hairs that let him stick to metal, paper, brick, what have you.  Ahhhh, yes, but then, now he's wearing a suit.  With gloves.  How can he still do this?Ohhh, wait a minute, is the argument.  You're nitpicking, Mr. Internet Guy, OBVIOUSLY it's very thin material.Well, yes, I get that.  I'm not stupid.  Why, then, did you feel the need to not explain that, but then show the flashback of the mugger running past Peter Parker?  Did we forget?  That scene happened TWO MINUTES BEFORE.  Wow, Mr. Raimi, seriously.  Either respect your audience's intelligence, or don't, but riding the fence in such an wimp-out way is only going to get you in trouble.  See also, again, ""Planet of the Apes"" remake.Lots of nice moments.  Cinematographer Don Burgess still lacks the visual ""wow"" that will ever make him great, so people must hire him because he's cheap; whatever.  Everyone ELSE knew what they were doing here, except Willem Dafoe, who should really go back to drama.  But I can't blame you for casting him; after all, look at what he did for ""Speed 2.""A valiant effort, Mr. Raimi, and I hope these notes will help you when it comes time to put the sequel together.  Special effects are there to HELP the story, not BE the story.  I'm all happy that Peter Parker is enjoying jumping from buildings, but don't you ever EVER replace a character with a CGI effect.  It didn't work in Harry Potter, it didn't work in Blade 2, it sure didn't work for JarJar, and so it doesn't work here.  If I were a movie executive, I would so fire you.However, being literate, I am too intelligent to be a movie executive.  You, Mr. Raimi, used to be smart, I suggest you call up your old buddies the Coens and have a long talk before you make any more rash decisions, like script choices, opening credits (I may care about the names of the cast, but 95% of America does not), or that horrible, awful, direct-to-bargain-bin soundtrack (not the score, mind you; but promise me to never hire Aerosmith or flavor-of-the-month Nickelback again, I don't care how many records they sell).I liked it, but seriously.

Good Effects,"""Spiderman"" was an enjoyable movie overall.  I wasn't all that familiar with the character before seeing the movie but I think it did a good job at telling the story and introducing the character.  Tobey Maguire was good as the lead but Willem Dafoe and Kirsten Dunst were somewhat wasted in their roles.  Some of the effects seemed cartoonish and some of the violent scenes weren't cartoonish enough.  The fight sequences, especially the punches to Spiderman's face, seemed too personal or intimate given the tone of the movie.  There were these cold CGI sequences followed by a bloody punch to the mouth of Spiderman in slow motion.  Was that really necessary?  I think it ruined the tone of the movie.  The Green Goblin was goofy.  It did not seem real at all and that ridiculous mask hid the actor.  Was that the point?  Why have a famous name as the villain if he is hid by the costume. Save the expense by hiring an unknown and hiding him in a fancy costume. Kirsten Dunst was wasted except for the wet dress scene.

William Dafoe was the only good thing about the movie because he played a very good villan.

Peter comes of age very quickly in this movie about the character named Spider-man who fights to defeat his enemies and bring peace to New York.Sam Raimi sets up all the main characters within the first 3-5 minutes of the movie. Something we see throughout the Spider-man film trilogy is that the writer focuses more on the character of Peter Parker than Spider-man as he tries to make both characters into one over the course of the films.What can I say about this amazing cast! Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker-Spider-man. Kirsten Dunst as MJ. O Clif Robertson as Ben Parker. Jk Simmons as J Jonah Jameson and the amazing Willem Dafoe!!!I have nothing else to say about this movie it's 10/10 it's just that the next movie does what it does well but 10x better!!! For that I put 8/10!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Very Good Characters Make Film,"Spider-Man (2002)*** (out of 4)The first film in the trilogy features Tobey Maguire playing Peter Parker, a dorky whiz who gains superhuman powers after being bitten by a generically engineered spider. With his new power he tries to work up the courage to talk to the girl he loves (Kirsten Dunst) but then a family tragedy forces him into crime fighting and battling the Green Goblin (William Dafoe) who just happens to be the father of his best friend (James Franco). SPIDER-MAN is a very good comic adaptation that benefits from some great direction by Sam Raimi, a wonderful screenplay with real characters and actors that bring those characters to life. There's no question that there are some flaws in the movie but none of them are so drastic that they take away from the quality of the film. In fact, I'd argue that the film has actually gotten better with time because of how well-written all the characters and situations are. This here is especially true of the Peter Parker character because he's just not a dork turned superhero. The screenplay really gives him a lot of emotions to play with and I think you really start to feel for the character and then feel for the problems that come along with his powers. The romance with Mary Jane works extremely well as does his friendship with the Franco character and the problems that eventually happen in not only the love triangle but the issues dealing with the villain. Raimi does a very good job at juggling all of this stuff and he manages to make sure that the action scenes live up to the expectation of fans but at the same time they never outdo the story and characters. It certainly doesn't hurt that the casting was so perfect. Maguire has no problems playing both the dork as well as the action hero and that laid back style of his perfectly comes to life in the film. Dunst makes for a good love interest as she just has a certain charm that she brings out of the character. Dafoe is wonderful, as usual, and he never has a hard time playing emotions or anger. Franco also does a very nice job as does the rest of the supporting players. SPIDER-MAN contains some very good action scenes and mixed in with all the human drama going on you're left with a strong entertainment.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Good Comic Book Movie,"""Peter Parker"" (Tobey Maguire) is a regular high school teenager who excels at science and loves photography. He also has a crush on the high school girl who lives next door named ""Mary Jane Watson"" (Kirsten Dunst). Unfortunately, being somewhat shy, Peter can never actually bring himself to reveal his feelings to her. Not that it would really matter because Mary Jane is dating a high school jock by the name of ""Flash Thompson"" (Joe Manganiello) who takes advantage of any and every opportunity to bully anybody who gets close to her. Then one day, while on a field trip to a local museum, Peter is bitten by a radioactive spider which gives him incredible powers--and suddenly everything changes for him as he subsequently becomes a superhero named Spider-Man with the main intention of bringing criminals to justice. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that from a technical standpoint, this film mirrors the actual comic book quite well in many respects. There are, however, a few discrepancies which caught my attention with the main one being that, in the comic book, Peter invented his web formula and shooting apparatus, while in this movie it all came naturally. Likewise, Spider-Man was also quite adept at bantering with his opponents whenever the opportunity presented itself. But even so, this film captured the basics quite well with Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and Willem Dafoe (as ""the Green Goblin"") all performing in an excellent manner. That being said, I recommend this film to those viewers looking for a good comic book movie, and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Sexy Spidey,"""Spider-Man"" is a flawed superhero movie, which has become more apparent with the passage of time and the deluge of superheroics in our culture since, but there is that kissing scene, which popularly remains the sexiest superhero moment filmed since Lois Lane spent a night flying with Superman in 1978. In the movies, at least, Spiderman is rather unique among superheroes for much of his narrative taking place in his teenage years, which consequently makes the acquisition of his superpowers analogous to the awkwardness and, later, joys of going through and coming out of puberty. All of that sexual metaphor comes to fruition in the scene where Spiderman recues Mary Jane from an attempted alleyway gangrape. The superheroic setup is perfunctory, and the settings accentuate movie romance, including rain to expose Mary's nipples and wet the kiss she performs on an-upside-down Spidey after undressing his mask. This is probably the closest a PG-13 superhero movie can come to a graphic sex scene. It gives an entirely new meaning to his web ejaculating, which, in this version, is a natural bodily process.Too bad the rest of the movie doesn't work as smoothly. Despite the occasional swooping to follow Spiderman soaring between buildings, much of the camerawork is unimaginative, if not downright stilted, especially those silly-looking steady close-ups of the actors when they're flying about, which is especially unfortunate given that Peter Parker within the narrative is a photographer. Much of the action and CGI looks too cartoonish. The bullet-time photography and the way Spiderman sometimes bends over backwards or contorts his body in slow-motion clearly rips off ""The Matrix"" (1999). The post-9/11 scene of New Yorkers fighting back on the bridge and a shot of Spiderman in front of a huge American flag are too blatant. The Green Goblin costume is horrendous, and Willem Dafoe arguing with himself in front of a mirror is none too interesting, either. The acting is all over the place, from James Franco's brooding to J.K. Simmons playing a caricature, and Dafoe doing both. But, Kirsten Dunst and Tobey Maguire did have that pining puppy-love thing down pat, and that helped sell the kiss.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Sam Raimi Spider-Man Trilogy Sucks!,"The worst movie I have ever seen, No offense to Tobey Maguire but he is the worst Spider-Man in history, and the action sequences were terrible, the only thing I liked from this trilogy is Willem Dafoe and JK Simmons and that's all, the narration was completely unnecessary and I get annoyed everytime, I'm happy for those that can enjoy these but unfortunately I cannot",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"The entire movie can be described in three words: cheesy, corny and childish.","With the little to no fight scenes, the over-acting and the terrible dialogue, ""Spider-Man""'s target audience must be toddlers.  I don't understand how anybody over the age of ten can like this movie.  There is barely any action!  The best fight scene consist of Spider-Man punching someone!And the acting is so over-dramatic that it's sickening.  I am surprised that veteran actor Willem Dafoe did such a terrible job as the Green Goblin, but still, he probably delivered the best performance.  Tobey Maguire smiles goofily as if he's a four year old who is trying to get onto his uncle's camera.  Kirsten Dunst's main acting ability is to whimper, that's all she does: whimper.I am surprised that David Koepp, the screenwriter, penned such great scripts as Panic Room after this disaster.

Not quite there..,"I realize I am going against the majority here but this film didn't quite do it for me. I have always been an avid fan of Spider-Man and I collected this comic when I was a kid but this film just seemed like it was missing something.  Some of the special effects were very distracting and I felt like I was watching a cartoon at times. It's obvious we have come along was since the days of the Spider-Man television series but it just still seemed a little fakey. The main problem I had ,however, was that many of the characters in the film just seemed very bland to me and I really didn't care about them. Although, I think Tobey Macguire is a competent actor and that his understated performances works well in most films I don't feel this was one of them. I would just like to see a little more of the inside of Peter Parker. Overall I would recommend seeing this film because it is neat to see a more realistic Spidey but this doesn't quite rise to the level of Christopher Reeve's first outing as Superman or Michael keaton's outing as Batman. I am hoping that Daredevil and The Incredible Hulk will offer a little bit more and maybe Tobey will kick it up a notch for Spidey 2. 6 out of 10 stars.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Cheesy Fun,"The first ""Spider-Man"" adaptation is not a great movie. It's campy and corny and some of the dialogue is downright terrible at some points. Actors like Willem Dafoe and J. K. Simmons ham up their performances pretty heavily. But it is an early superhero movie and it does a pretty good job of bringing the cartoonish and colorful nature of comic books to the big screen. It has elements of what made the Tim Burton ""Batman"" movies great, as well as borrowing a bit from the Joel Schumacher ones.Willem Dafoe definitely makes the movie as the sinister Green Goblin. He seems to revel in the role, every single scene that he's in is just filled with one-liners and puns and goofiness that's just really fun to watch. Tobey Maguire also does an excellent job as the awkward dork Peter Parker. Subsequent portrayals of the character have seemed lacking in that aspect.All in all, this movie does a good job of adapting the ""Spider-Man"" origin to the big screen and also giving the audience an exciting and entertaining popcorn flick.P. S. Randy Savage, the wrestler, makes an appearance in this movie and it's great.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Incredibly disappointing.,"As a huge Sam Rami fan I wanted to like this movie, but I found it to be tediously predictable and poorly written.  The characters were portrayed with such lack luster performances that I hope the franchise switches leading men and love interests as much as the Batman series.  Even the visual effects failed to wow me (and were quite poor in many places).  This movie might be a big bang right now, but I suspect that is more caused by the horrible movies that have preceded it this year.My wife summed this movie up when she called it ""Gumby versus the Evil Power Ranger"".  The CG Spiderman was more like Rubberman and the Green Goblin (both CG and Willem Dafoe) looked like he really belonged in an episode of the Power Rangers.  The writing also took its cues from these two shows. One half corny jokes and silly gags and the other half being chessy cornball stuff that 5 years olds find funny but adults simply find inane.The acting was atrocious.  While I wish this film would mark the end of the careers of the untalented duo of Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, I suspect I will be tortured by these two hacks for many years to come.  Willem Dafoe should stop acting all together.  He had one great role and simply diminishes it every time he appears in another role.  I knew that this movie was going to be devoid of good acting when Sam actually hired Cliff Robertson.  The only performance I enjoyed was the five minutes of Rami veteran, Bruce Campbell.  His screen time was the only thing I liked in this whole movie.The visual effects looked like Batman and Robin (which is not a compliment). John Dykstra needs to go back to flying spaceships and blowing up minatures.  He has no talent for character animation.  I was immensely disappointed with the whole look of the CG elements.  The lighting was horrible and the composites rarely worked.  In general, I am tired of the whole over exposed grainy look that so many of the recent visual effects heavy films are employing.  I marvel at how rich and vibrant the colors are in all of the Star Wars and Indiana Jones films and how rarely we see that same look in films of that same genre.This film is aimed at kids under the age of 10 (and adults who wish to harken back to a time when they were incapable of smelling a rotten egg). I would take my kids to see it because it does have a strong moral sense (sort of) and lacks the violence of usual action films, but then I would duck out to see Star Wars instead.  I weep for the future of this industry if this is the kind of drivel that appeals to the public right now.  Clearly the age of the popular and ""good"" movie may be coming to an end.If I wasn't excited about Attack of the Clones, I can't wait now.  I need something to clear the nasty taste that ""Spider-man"" has left in my mouth.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Web That Caught the World's Heart,"In 2002, Spider-Man didn't just swing onto the big screen; it redefined the superhero genre forever. Directed by Sam Raimi, this was more than just an origin story. It was a cinematic milestone that showed superheroes could be emotionally resonant, visually dazzling, and universally inspiring. For Gen Zs and Gen Alphas, this is the movie that paved the way for today's Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it deserves every ounce of its legendary status.The film had all the ingredients of greatness. Tobey Maguire's earnest portrayal of Peter Parker/Spider-Man captured the duality of a vulnerable teen grappling with immense power and responsibility. Willem Dafoe's menacing Green Goblin set the gold standard for complex villains. And Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson brought warmth and heart to the story.The cinematography by Don Burgess made swinging through New York feel exhilarating and iconic, while Danny Elfman's score perfectly captured the grandeur and soul of Spider-Man's journey. Every frame felt larger than life, yet grounded in human emotion.But it's the historical context that makes this movie truly timeless. Released less than a year after the 9/11 tragedy, Spider-Man became a symbol of hope for a grieving world. The original poster had to be changed because Spider-Man's mask reflected the Twin Towers, but the film still honored New York's resilience. The unforgettable line, ""You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us,"" was a love letter to the city's unity. It gave audiences a hero who wasn't just fighting for himself, but for everyone, a theme that resonated deeply during a time of recovery.Spider-Man (2002) is more than a movie, it's a cultural touchstone. It reminded the world that heroes are made not by their powers, but by their choices. Over two decades later, this masterpiece remains fresh, emotional, and utterly unforgettable. ""With great power comes great responsibility,"" and Raimi's Spider-Man truly lived up to that promise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Awesome superhero movie!,"I first saw 'Spider-Man' when it was released in 2002. I just re-watched the movie this evening for the first time in nearly two decades, and it's still a fun film! It checks off everything that you want from a superhero film. Action? Check. Interesting characters? Check. Excellent storytelling? Check. Drama? Check. Room for a sequel? Check. 'Spider-Man' tells a very compelling origin story of our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. It's no wonder so many sequels have spawned because the this film set an excellent foundation for the franchise.The biggest flaw with 'Spider-man' is the special effects are outdated. There are many moments throughout the film where it's very obvious you're looking at a computer-generated images. These effects may have been cutting edge for 2002 standards, but they have not aged well. Even though the special effects are outdated, I found myself not actually bothered by them. I found the outdated special effects were sort of a time capsule that took me back to an era of filmmaking, which in my opinion added another layer to the film's charm and personality.8/10 overall rating.

Web-Spinning Entertainment!,"""Spider-Man"", while not quite the spectacle and extravaganza as its successor, is definitely something special, working freshly and effectively as a blockbuster, and as a human story of overcoming adversity. Peter Parker (Toby Maguire) is a beleaguered outcast who genetically transforms into a superhuman with spider senses, thus enabling him to become a superhero who nets criminal offenders in a web, while vigorously swinging from building to building above the streets of New York City. His nemesis is also one of his most loyal acquaintances, Norman Osborn (who becomes the notorious Green Goblin, wreaking havoc on his ""glider"" and combating the heroism of Spider-Man), his best friend Harry (James Franco)'s father, who promises, whatever Peter needs ""just give me a call"". Now all that is in need is a love interest and vulnerability for the impervious Spider-Man, and Kirstin Dunst plays Mary Jane Watson, the girl whom Peter Parker desires more than any other and whose life he ""has a knack for saving"". The action throughout the film is exhilarating and sensational, and watching Spider-Man exhibit his superhuman capabilities is nothing short of breathtaking, especially set amidst the interference of the ruthless Green Goblin. The story is deeper and more concentrated upon than what might be expected from a summer blockbuster, yet not nearly as personal or even engaging as ""Spider-Man 2"" two years later. The technical aspects of course are nothing short of marvelous, with the CGI entirely believable (if somewhat cartoonish, a feat much corrected in ""Spider-Man 2""), the music sensational and portentous to the spectacular action, and the editing of Spider-Man slinging high above the streets of New York, battling his nemesis the Green Goblin, and rescuing Mary Jane and a bus load of innocents is extremely effective and really builds the intense atmosphere the film is trying to convey with the action. Perhaps a major complaint can be had with the cliché and by-the-numbers script, which features some really cheesy one-liners such as ""You're not SuperMan you know"" and ""I was in the neighborhood""--- blah, blah, blah. Yet what a remarkable achievement ""Spider-Man"" really is, when it manages to be both an exhilarating, special-effects laden blockbuster, and a really human and somewhat captivating story, and as entertainment, it's a real web-spinner! ***1/2 out of ****",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A hype!,"This is one of the films that make you wonder whether news reporting is just another way of advertising. The film was mentioned in the news so often until you just had to see it. So I did. First the good of it: brilliant special effects that I enjoyed and some good jokes, which were partly given away by the trailers however. And when you watch the ""famous"" kissing scene you only think of the water that allegedly drips into his nose. And now to the bad: The film is very slow-moving and even boring at times. The dialogues are tremendously bad - as if they'd been taken from the comic without any change. The acting is not bad, but with such dialogues even a good actor looks stupid. And I bet like many other Europeans we're getting a bit fed up with all those expressions of American patriotism and those pathetic ""big"" heroes that Americans seem to love so much. There is no way around the American flag in American films it seems.

Better than I remember.,"The introduction to the powers are entertaining and well done. Flash and peters fight is well choreographed, the wall climb, the bus chase. Everything works and looks great even to this day. The rooftop jumping scene does need a little suspension of disbelief due to a little dated cgi. Which pops up a few times in wall climbing and web swinging when he isn't in the spider-man suit.Theres a few great character moments, Mj and Peters first interaction was wholesome, Uncle Ben and peter in the car and harry Osborn with peter, all intriguing.Some great action sequences, the first fight with flash, the wrestling scene, the blip mj rescue, the rain fight scene and any slow motion works just great. Ofcourse lets not forget the final fight. Brutal and emotional.Parker is a bit a whiney baby, sorry for himself, even before uncle bens death. Moaning quite frequently at everything and everyone, but in contrast, he is also refreshingly brutal and raw whilst learning what he is becoming it's certainly the most emotionally broad character to date in the marvel films up to 2002. Thanks to this the movie can hit multiple tones through a range of emotionsJjj is world class entertainment. Easily the best character in the movie. Its not far off in second place, but Willem Defoe is class too, the mirror monologue scene perfectly sums up his talents. All of the monologues are great, one of the highlights of the film.Spiderman isnt very quippy. He isnt very spiderman. Hes very moody, down and serious, something I don't associate with the character that I love from the cartoons, games and movies.

Also, Tobey's lack of enthusiasm is very contagious even to the audience. I wished that I were dead myself as he relayed to the fake redhead what he had told Spiderman about her.

"I would like to retract my earlier statement; ""Spider-Man"" isn't all that bad...","In my previous review of ""Spider-Man"" I unfairly listed all the bad things about it and gave it a 3.5 out of 10, which is really too low a rating. Though this is by no means a great film, it's not very bad either.  The plot - obviously - focuses on Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), a high school nerd, who is bitten by a radio active spider and gains spider powers.  He uses them to fight crime, make money and woo is long-time crush Mary-Jane (Kirsten Dunst).  Meanwhile Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe) - a high-ranking millionaire/scientist - has gained some super human abilities of his own, and become ""The Green Goblin"", a crazy high-flying super villain whose motives are never really made known.First I'll start by saying that when I wrote my review last year I hadn't seen many Raimi films yet, but no that I have I understand his style and the type of comedy he uses.  He's a lot like Joel and Ethan Coen, you have to recognize their entire body of work or else one movie may seem a little too odd to you.I also complained about the action, and I'm sticking too that argument. Maybe it's just me, but I hate it when all the action in a film is computer generated.  I love watching movies where I know that the actors or stuntmen really did do what's shown on screen (""Kill Bill"", ""The Matrix"") instead of just a guy at a desk clicking a mouse and typing keys.  Of course, there are a few exceptions - 2003's ""Hulk"" for example - but ""Spider-Man"" isn't one of them.  Of course, action doesn't make a film.The acting in ""Spider-Man"" varies with the actors and characters.  Maguire is completely miscast as Parker, he doesn't capture the smoothness of the character of the comics.  The writing is somewhat to blame too I guess, but the way Maguire speaks his lines is just awful.  As for the others, well, like I said, it varies.  Dafoe is admirable as Osborne, he makes a good villain, and Dunst gives another great performance (the best of the movie) as MJ.  The supporting players, James Franco, J.K. Simmons, Cliff Robertson all do pretty well too.In the end this is merely an enjoyable yet mediocre super-hero film, but nothing compared to the greats (""Batman Returns"", ""X-Men"", ""Hulk"").  The fact that it has a rating of 7.4 while the three other films I've mentioned are getting lower bugs me.  To me, this movie is a 6.5/10.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

This film is about as exciting as...,"...spending an evening de-scaling your kettle, or, dare I say, clipping the toenails of you and your entire family (including grandparents).I went to see this film to see what the fuss was all about. The storyline is entirely predictable, even to those who have never read the comic books. I would put it into the ever growing category of films with a poor storyline, poor acting, but with expensive and overblown special effects whose aim is to disguise the film-maker's total lack of imagination.The only reason people tend to give for liking this film is the special effects. Unfortunately, this kind of effects can be seen in pretty much all the action films that come off Hollywood's conveyor belt of uninspired, unimaginative junk these days.I hate to sound like a miserable old man, even though I'm only twenty eight, but it seems that film-makers these days know they don't need to go to much effort to make a successful film. They need just need a predictable story-line with a happy ending, and a clunky, corny script. They then pay an enormous amount of money for some passé special effects, knowing that they will still make a fortune at the box-office due to over-hype and the hordes of witless westerners who are too stupid to appreciate any film which is remotely challenging.I know I am not comparing like with like, but films such as It's A Wonderful Life, Casablanca, The Wicker Man, The Shawshank Redemption and Leon (off the top of my head) are superb stories with engaging characters and good acting. None of these aspects seem important anymore. Just throw in a load of special effects and you'll make a fortune. Moreover, why does every remotely successful film have a sequel these days? I'll tell you why; to make even more cash. And the sequels tend to be even worse than the first film.

I Saw It First,"YEAH,I went thinking hey, if this turns out like blade II, I will lose all faith in marvel movies.  I have nothing against blade the hero, but the origan movie was so good, and then out of nowhere comes this bad movie. The pace of a movie is essential and that's what killed blade II.  It was too fast to comprehend.  Like a cheap magician who had to move quick so you wouldn't notice how cheap he was.Such was not the case with spiderman.  It is slow enough to comprehend, and there's nothing to hide.  It's all very well done.  Acting was great, and although some romance scenes were to kids what corny acting is to adults, I think there's something for everybody in this film.Ok, so you want details? Big juicy inside stuff? Nah, sorry kids I don't believe in that kind of stuff.  Besides if you were a real nerd first class you'd go out and buy ESSENTIAL SPIDERMAN volumes I-V and you'd not only know everything about this movie but its sequels as well.I look forward to seeing Doctor Octopus in the next film.  Till then, I hope Peter Parker has enough web fluid to yank Star Wars Episode II Mucas Lukas Attacks down to size.Hmmm....Seriously this is better than Superman (was there ever any doubt?).

mediocre,"Basically if you poor enough money into a story as interesting as spider-man it should be watchable. well it is, but not much more than that.I tried to avoid this movie seeing how it was big budgeted and the commericals look like it was soaked with cgi. Well i caved in rented it after seeing the part with uncle ben talking to peter in wallmart(aka hell). Was it as bad as i thought it would be? no. Was it good?no.i'll admiit that im a bit of a reformed comicbook geek but, it wasn't the descrepency's with the comics that bothered me (with the one exception that peter stands his own with the tough guy at school, peter was still a loser in school. And would always think to himself ""if only they knew i was spiderman). It was the fact that is was poorly developed. One minute thay move to the city, the next he has a spider-man costume, aunt may cry's after her husbend dies for two seconds. does peter cry at all?The ending is too blatent as well.also. the green goblin is a p*** poor villian. if you'd like to see a good comic book movie watch tim burton's batman movies or the the first superman. Marvel's big budget x-men is equally as bad, and i have my doubts that good comic book will come out for some time.I know these movies are suposed to be for kids but if they took a little more effort they could be enjoyed by adults too.lord of the rings, both harry potter movies, and star wars ep 2 have all been on the top 250. none of these movies are really horrible but none of them have anything special about them. HEll the effects of these 50million plus movies arent even good. when you see computer graphics you think ""wow thats great"" although you can tell it was obviously done with a computer and sticks out from everything else thats going on.

Such a good watch,"Now, the Raimi trilogy, wasn't the best. But was what I and alot of other people grew up with. Spider-Man has alot to offer.

A Spider Can,"Not too bad for a throwaway summer flick.  Tobey and Kirsten fan their romantic flames in classic fashion, delaying and denying their PG-13 attractions to each other as long as possible, even until the inevitable sequels.  Dafoe is remarkably adept in his way-over-the-top out-for-blood-though-tortured villain.  And the action-packed special effects are marvelously stunning, overcoming their cartoonish shortcomings (SpiderMan's jumps remind me of the Mario Brother's Nintendo games) by turning up the violence (when a madman drops a bomb, oh yes, innocents do die).  But the real star is the script, expertly weaving campy dialogue with clever self-deprecating humor (SpiderMan's world wrestling debut was far and away the highlight of the film).  It's always more refreshing when a summer movie knows its place and plays up the fun instead of pretending to be important.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Who am I, You sure you want to know?","Spider-Man directed by Sam Rami stars Tobey Maguire, Kristen Dunst, and William Dafoe. You all know the story Peter Parker your Sociality awkward Nerdy high schooler life changes forever after he's bitten by a radioactive spider and develops spider-enhanced superpowers. Along with the death of his uncle Bean. Peter decides to put his power to good use and protects the city of New York from crime and evil. The Rami Spiderman films are some of my favorite movies. When the first film came out it pushed the boundaries of want a comic book film can be. It was the Batman 89 of the 2000s. It was funny, action full of comic book tropes. From its serious to its campier moments, it still manages to capture the essence of Spider-Man. Even with several Films Tobey Maguire is still the face many people think of when you say Spider-Man he embodied that nerdy yet likable charms that Peter represented and while Some would argue that he's kind of dated that nerds aren't like this anymore it's a more traditional Spider-Man that not as modernized as Andrew Garfield or Tom Holland. However, he still manages to deliver great performances even with some strange line delivery ""I Hunch"". You feel his emotions when he's hurt or when he doesn't know what to do. That's really where the movie shines with Peter's character with these powers and comes to gripes on wants should he do. How will the public accept him? Does he feel responsible for his uncle's death and needs to atone for it? How should he use his gift? Though a hero needs his archenemies, and William Dafoe as Norman Osborn this was some of the best cast selection to make. The best camp of the films comes from him, he just hams it up as the Goblin and has a hell of a time. It's a character with a split personality it should be serious when he's talking to this mask, but it's funnier than anything. I don't think anybody's going to defend that costume even back then it's and now it's ridiculous as hell. You can see how a lot of his play-off with James Franco as Harry built up over the films. It shows that Norman favors Peter over his son and Harry in some way resents them both for it. Along with Mary Jane Harry just feels his part the right amount. Not saying that Kirsten Dunst didn't give a good performance she did just as much as any of the others. However, she does have much outside of being saved and smiling. They show her home life only a little, but it wasn't until the 2nd film she had more of a character. The cinematography is good the movie still manages to bring all the wonder of seeing Spiderman swing around to do all these flips and turns. Still one of the best moments is when Peter first climbs up the wall. The fights are fun and intense. In the finale with the green goblin, Spider-Man gets brutalized. The cg is the only thing that sticks out. It got the job done but it sticks out now just look at the parade. Did you ever believe the goblin was there or when Peter jumped from the rooftop?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND SKIP THIS ONE,"The weekend was coming up, I had nothing better to do, so I fell into the trap of high-budget box office entertainment, and paid the $9.50 to see ""Spiderman.""  After the first 45 minutes of the film, I was thinking to myself that I couldn't have spent the money any better--I was laughing at Tobey Maguire's reactions to his newfound spider-like abilities, I was getting drawn into the plot and looking forward to some action, and I even found myself rooting for Tobey Maguire who is perfectly cast as the classic and predictable high-school nerd.  But things soon took a terrible turn. The acting became terrible, the plot became completely predictable, and the special effects became so unrealistic and visually flawed that I found them at the point of distraction.  As a New Yorker, I found the city-assaults on New York by the ""Green Goblin"" not entertaining, but more of a recreation of Sept. 11th.  But then, later on in the film, I found myself annoyed at how the makers of this film, obviously influenced by September 11th, put in all these scenes with the people of New York united against evil, and Spiderman flying by all these American flags.  Is it too much to ask not to have scenes of bombs killing people, buildings being blown to bits, people running everywhere, and screams?  But then is it too much to ask not to have corny things thrown into every scene just to prove to the movie-going public that the makers of the film care more about morals than profit?  With this film I found myself smack in the middle of two extremes.  Class, simplicity, style...these elements were not used by the makers of this film.  Gaudy special effects, large explosions, and artificial and shallow love scenes were the things that made up this film.  Spidey is a young nerd one minute; a raging maniac determined for revenge the next.  Kirsten Dunst likes him one minute, and then she blows him off for a while.  The love scenes that were the only human-touches this film had were meant to be as simple, dull, and straightforward as possible, but in the end were only confusing!  I didn't even know whether I should take the time to review this film, but I hope I've helped someone.  My advice...see ""Panic Room"" instead.  It's also a big, box office smash, but is immeasurably better.  Save your time and money on this one--unless you're a parent of smaller kids or under the age of 16.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

More than I expected,"Sam Raimi was really a great director, an almost revolutionary innovator with the Evil Dead series and the author of an excellent noir like A Simple Plan, but in other cases (for example the last one starring Kevin ""Stinky"" Costner) he was very disappointing. So my expectations for Spider-Man were very low (I'm a die-hard batmanian!!). But, sometimes it happens again, the movie was better than I thought. In particular the first half, in my opinion the part that really interested Raimi: the developing of the mutation as a metaphor of Peter Parker's hormonal developing. Or a brilliant idea like the wrestling one to explain the use of a costume, necessary for a superhero but unusual in real life. The second half is more directed with the auto pilot, with the usual topics of comics movie (kidnapping of the girl, hero versus his nemesis, ecc.), but it doesn't diminish the good impression left by the first one. A last positive mention for Tobey Maguire and a negative one for Willem Dafoe (he is really overacting!) and the special effects, sometimes too evident. But it's better to do so, less accurate special effects and more attention to the screenplay, the exact opposite of the slaughter committed by Lucas to one of our favorite series (guess what?)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Dis.App.Ointing!!,"Yes, this movie is disappointing. I've heard so much hype from people I know and trust, that I actually had some expectations for sensation & innovation here..I like the nerdy main character, but Spidey wasn't a nerd when he was Spidey. He was a really cool character with all the right, relaxed punchlines in the middle of danger (while his thoughts betrayed that he was anything besides relaxed). Also, when things got a little too ""super-heroey"" and the bad guys sported fancy moves and evil, over-the-top cheesy costumes, Spidey always had a sarcastic comment about their suit or similarly, to make them even more angry..Nothing of that here. The only thing we hear Spidey say, is with a squeaky, nerdy voice - exactly like Peter Parker's. Sigh.Of course, we get the obligatory upside-down-with-mask-half-off - kiss, which is nice enough. The school bully get's a serious beating, which is a great scene. There is also some nice comic relief, for instance when Spidey wears his first suit.. that was really funny, but so were the ""worst"" love scenes.The evil character is REALLY weakly designed. With the brushed metallic suit, carrying an eeevil grin (help!), it was laughable, and even more kitschily ""I wanna be hitech"" than Batman's suit in the latter film.Also, the special effects are terrible. When Spidey did his first, spider-like jumps here, you could VERY easily see what was CG and what wasn't. That was especially annoying when there, in a ""jumping from roof-to-roof""-scene, for a while was 2 sec CG, 2 sec film, 2 sec CG, etc.. terrible.Attack of the Clones not only - surprisingly (!) - has MUCH less embarrassing, gut-wrenching, mushy love scences, but also is a much more sensational and innovative movie, all over. I thought there might be a ""duel"" between these two, but no chance whatsoever for Spidey here.All in all, an OK ""superhero movie"" (which is definitively what it is), but except for the nerdiness and personal problems, it has few of the qualities that made the comic a success. I'm sorry to say that this first Spiderman movie will be forgotten faster than you can say ""Two Towers"".. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Good presence of people, locations, buildings, vehicles, police... Except the superhero and scifi part everything is so real. The love, the science, the friendship, the family, the business. Only better scifi movies I've seen are ones based more on science and less on fiction and heroism. But considering that this is based on comics and for kids, that is acceptable. Good actors too.

"Remember, it was a comic book first.","Once I remembered it was developed from a comic book, I was able to forgive the campy performance by Kirsten Dunst as the love interest.  Once forgiven, the movie was enjoyable and a very nice flash back to my childhood and watching Spidey on television.  Unfortunately, the computer graphics used to enhance the web swinging sequences failed to take into account basic rules of physics and the fact that humans (even with spider powers) just don't bend that way.

Classic Spider-Man,Spider-Man (2002) is a true coming of age story and helped bring comic book movies into the modern age of Cinema. I have seen this movie a million and one times and I have been satisfied every time. Tobey Maguire is a great casting choice to play Peter Parker and really embodies that side of Spider-Man. My only problem with Maguire is that he does not seem to have the confidence in the role of Spider-Man have in that particular section of the character. Where as his successors as Spider-Man Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland do. Maguire is unable to produce great Spidey jokes and lines that will make you laugh and maybe that is much more down to the direction the movie took under Sam Raimi. Kirsten Dunst is an ok Mary Jane Watson but Peter and M. J. do not have great chemistry compared to Peter and Gwen from the Amzing Spider-Man duology. Otherwise the casting is excellent as James Franco plays a great Harry Osborn and is basically the face of the character. Willem Dafoe does a great job as Norman Osborn/ Green Goblin and is one of the greatest movie villains of all time in my opinion. Otherwise from the small blemishes this film has obviously compared to the new ones with some of the special effects being slightly dated such as the scene where those four guys just turn into skeletons This film is a true Spider-Man story which is very close to the comics and I praise Raimi and CO for that. I love this film even more every time I watch it and will always be a fan.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Decent movie,This movie is in every way an average movie. The only thing done well is the casting of Tobey Macquire as Spiderman. He is excellent for the role and acts decently.

An Unique Superhero movie!,"Movies like that don't exist anymore. I have to admit that I'm not the biggest Marvel fan. The new Marvel movies are getting lower and lower in quality, it is always some space story and secret magical source that can take over the world. Spider-Man is something different. The first movie that takes up the story about Spider-Man is really doing the job, especially that it is so well directed by Sam Raimi (The Evil Dead) and (Doctor Strange in The Multiverse of Madness). He did something with the icon Spider-Man that I don't think any other director can do. And looking from the other sides, the action, character development, and suspense build-up, couldn't have been made better. I remove two stars mostly because one or two scenes were pretty predictable, but at the same time, it isn't such a big problem, because I have a different feeling about that specific scenes. For example, when some bandits are trying to beat up a women, Spider-Man is coming and beat them once and for all, and that is predictable, but I liked that scenes so much mostly because of that action-comic book feeling that was so well adapted here. Spider-Man lives a double-life, and it was showed amazingly good for such a movie. When Spider-Man is just a normal guy, Peter Parker, the focus is more on his love life with Mary Jones. Peter is trying desperately to talk with her, but it isn't that easy. Tobey Maguire as the very first superhero spider was played best from all of the three Spider-Mans ever. He had a great expression and fit great as the guy that helps everyone. The villain was also greatly performed, he was strong, menacing and creepy, just as a villain should be. Now these days it is very different perspectives about how a villain should really be. To summarise, Spider-Man was a great beginning with amazing direction, it did have the comic book feeling and that retro-superhero atmosphere, that I really enjoyed. Entertaining, but some scenes could have been less predictable. But I still recommend it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Who's the Director?,"Yes, director Raimi made his mark in the movie business with his ""Evil Dead"" film (before doing this Spidey movie).  He initially doubted the validity of Dunst's acting abilities.  Ms. Kirsten was already making mince-meat out of actors such as Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise... and she was only eleven-years-old at the time that 'Vampire' movie was first released a decade ago.  One might ask Raimi himself ""Who are you?"" and then say ""Kirsten Dunst"" is already legend.Now about the movie ""Spider-man""...I thoroughly enjoyed this actioner/romancer.  There is plenty for boys, girls and adults.  Of course, the violence sometimes reaches intense proportions and levels, but then what are we paying for movies nowadays? Do we want to spend $9.50 for a trip to our backyards?  The answer is a resounding ""NO!""The actors playing Spidey/Peter Parker, Mary Jane, and all the rest, do their best at what they do best.  Even Wilem Dafoe as the green villain is totally right on up there with other cinematic baddies, and deserves the respect and proper credit very few, stuck-up critics are willing to give.Fantastic special-effects, but we all know that film-makers nowadays have got to focus more on story, and less on cyber-magic (Let's face it, sometimes these fx artists get a bit carried away!).Watch this one with people who don't like talking to you while you're trying to pay attention to the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"A Webslinging Adventure: Good, Mediocre? You Decide...","Ok, I know you all have probably rushed out to the 100mil dollar 3 day opening Spiderman, so, here are my thoughts.First, I'd like to say I did enjoy it as a comicbook film, it was fun, even if cliched, and well casted. Tobey McGuire is just perfect as Peter Parker, there's an innocence to him, an unassuming quality that he brings to the role, much like his roles in Wonder Boys and Cider House Rules, both movies of which I love.Then there's Kirsten Dunst, as the attractive red-headed Mary Jane. I thought she did an adequite job of the part, providing the 'heroine in distress' number for Spiderman to rescue, and an 'unreachable' number for Peter to gawk at and fawn over.Oh, and then there's William Dafoe, good ol' Dafoe... I can't say I have any reservations about him in much else except the cool what if making of story, Shadow of the Vampire. But here, in Spideyworld, I felt he plays the part well.Ok, now, what I liked about the film was it did manage a pure comicbook fantasy and for that, it remains an entertaining piece of the new marvel crop of their comicbook revolution that began with Blade and X-Men, but, there's also some problems with the direction they chose. Namely, I've seen this story before, not just in the comicbooks, no, but in the last animated series of Spiderman of the 90s. This means very little was actually new, just a retelling, or a remake, if you will. It's not just that, but how closely it comes to it, it just feels like I've already been here before, with a few variances. I mean, it can be, in a sense, good or bad. The Green Goblin's story is much the same as it was in the animated series as well, though more spread out over the season. This is a live action version, which I enjoyed, but I would have personally rather had something more original and maybe dealt with the origin in a short flashback sequence.Now, my other minor problems came with the design for the Goblin's mask, which is fine when he's flying around, but up close, was hard at first to get used to. Course, once I did, then everything was fine. On the other side of the coin, however, the Spidey suit was excellent in every regard; perfect, for lack of a better word. It doesn't look ridiculously like a man in tights, it actually looks like a cool suit of a comicbook hero and the way it blends in with the CGI varient was pretty nice.Everything is well laid out for the most part, but another issue I'd like to mention is Green Goblin's lack of direction in the 2nd half. After he got what he wanted, his motivations didn't seem as thought out. I think another minor plotline inbred within the story that could have lasted the whole of the movie and giving him more of a purpose at the end besides just making Parker miserable, would have helped the movie as a whole feel more complete.Now, to wrap up... I can't wait to see the sequel, now that the ground work has been laid out, let's see something really cool in the next one. Lots of potential here. I liked the film, and I will definitely pick it up on DVD eventually and enjoy it at home, but I still feel X-Men is a better marvel superhero comicbook flick, in my opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The start of something great!,"Spider-Man truly was the start of something brilliant. This movie kick started the massive comic book phenomenon we all know and love today. Yes there was movies like blade and x-men that came before this one but this was the first one to smash the box office and really get people involved with the idea of comic book movies. Yes this film has a lot of flaws but overall it really is amazing, it's cheesy, it's funny, it's over the top but it's an amazing adaptation of the wall crawler. This film just gives me pure nostalgia and it really does remind me of good times. I grew up with this franchise and it's what made me love comic books in the first place. Toby Maguire isn't the best at acting but he does a good job at playing this version of spider-man and I couldn't see anyone else playing this version. While the effects haven't aged very well they are still pretty decent for the time. The spider-man suit is absolute chefs kiss, it's easily one of the best looking suits on live action.

Wow!,"after being an avid reader/collector of the spider-man comic series for 15 years, i was desperately hoping not to be disappointed when production of the movie was announced, thankfully i wasnt, quite the opposite in fact! tobey maguire as peter parker was an inspired choice! after seeing him in movies like cider house rules, pleasantville and wonder boys, i knew he'd be the perfect peter. kirsten dunst(my fav actress) is again excellent although she doesnt look like the mj i had always pictured, but this is was never a problem for me. the rest of the cast ranges from solid to excellent. the story is excellent, lively and humourous - exactly what one comes to expect from a spidey yarn. although some lines come offas corny, remember this is a comic book movie, not schindlers list(another excellent movie). overall i gave this movie a solid 9 out of 10, and ranks in my top5 movies of 2002, just behind minority report and the LOTR: The Two Towers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A web-slinging adventure,"""Spider-Man,"" directed by Sam Raimi, is a thrilling adaptation of the beloved comic book character, marking a significant moment in the superhero film genre. Tobey Maguire stars as Peter Parker, an ordinary teenager who gains extraordinary abilities after being bitten by a genetically modified spider. Maguire captures the essence of Peter's transformation into Spider-Man, balancing vulnerability and newfound power.The film excels with its engaging origin story, effectively exploring Peter's journey of self-discovery and responsibility. Kirsten Dunst delivers a charming performance as Mary Jane Watson, Peter's love interest, adding emotional depth to the narrative. Willem Dafoe is particularly memorable as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, providing a compelling and menacing antagonist.Raimi's direction brings a unique blend of action, humor, and heart, with impressive visual effects and exhilarating web-slinging sequences that still hold up. Danny Elfman's iconic score further enhances the film's atmosphere.While some elements may feel dated, ""Spider-Man"" remains a solid and entertaining entry in the superhero genre, setting the stage for future films. It balances character development and action, making it a memorable and enjoyable watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Incredible.,"This is going to sound like a typical fanboy review, but I just saw a sneak peak of Spiderman, and I found it to be simply Amazing.Each member of the cast was perfect for their role, specifically Willem Dafoe, who played the insanity role of the Green Goblin quite well. Tobey Maguire was an unexpected surprise, able to show both sides of the Spidey costume with ease. J.K. Simmons filled the always-fun role of J. Jonah with his own unique style - not at all like the Mr. Jameson we've seen in every other Spidey series before, but still enjoyable.Others have said that the screenplay was trite and overplayed. I disagree. I thought the story was very typical for a Spiderman-themed anything, but it served it's purpose as the basis of a (hopefully) long-term movie series. The next installation in this series will be more unique and originally, one would have to assume.I thought Stan Lee's minor cameo was unexpected, and in fact, it sounded like I was the only one in the theater to spot him. I won't spoil it, so that you can find The Man for yourself.Overall, I enjoyed the movie for what it was, an action-packed, somewhat dramatic, well-made summer blockbuster. I highly recommend this movie to those of all shapes, sizes, and ages!8/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Horrible!,"One thing I will say about this movie- it didn't make me want to go out and read Spider-Man comics. Even though I am not a fan of the original webbed hero, I will say that I know enough about him to figure out that he wasn't correctly depicted in this film, especially considering this film was geared to the younger generation.You know the story- geek wants pretty girl, big bad boy has pretty girl, geek gets bitten by a mutated spider and becomes super-hero who saves the day and shoots webbing from his wrists. Anonymous super-hero finally gets the girl, but at the last minute geeky super-hero turns down girl because of his super-powers. What utter nonsense.My first complaint is that there was way to much unecessary violence in the film (i.e. especially at the end when the Green Goblin's abdomen was sliced and blood was shown flowing from his mouth as he..""died""). I was also pretty shocked at the numbers of young children that were in the audience. Second, even though I liked Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst in their respective roles, I thought the film was poorly-cast and badly written. The plot was so predictable. The ending was the worst. It was obviously an opening for a sequal. About halfway through the film, I wanted to get up and walk out.I know about the next two planned sequals to this film, but I can asure you I won't be seeing either one of them.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

performance, William Dafoe as

the film it's so much more than that.By being a great origin story and funny
it made the world know that super Heroes

is simple and effective, the scenes
vary between the hero and the villain
until they finnaly meet up. This movie
still has comic book foolishness which
makes it very funny but it takes away the

are very inconsistent , some are Fantastic

was ok. I can forguive the action because
of the time but the CGI it's just awfull

no Debate. You will understand

Pleasant surprise,"Although I grew up reading and watching Superman, Superboy and Batman, I ignored the SpiderMan comics entirely.  On a whim, I rented the DVD and found it very entertaining - although I would have been a little lost without using the optional pop-up info windows.Tobey McGuire is perfectly cast as Peter Parker/SpiderMan.

"Good, but not extraordinary.","This movie basically shows the emergence of Spiderman: the way Peter Parker, a teenager, changes his life after being bitten by a genetically modified spider. He becomes a hero, able to do justice and protect the weak. But on the other side of the barricade comes the Green Goblin, a villain that only he can stop.I'm not a fan of comics-based movies, but I must admit that this movie has its quality. It shows a hero who, after all, is still a teenager with doubts and learning. The script seems to me well done, presenting a story reasonably capable of capturing the interest of those who do not even like this genre of movies very much.The actors seem to me to have made a positive effort. I liked Tobey Maguire, he was quite human in a character who risked being just a red suit that jumps from building to building. Willem Dafoe was a pretty good villain, and even before turning, he knew how to give his character an amoral touch. Kirsten Dunst, an actress I don't even appreciate widely, did a job well done. James Franco didn't surprise me, but there's no room for much more than he did either. J.K. Simmons was a surprise to bring us a profoundly annoying character, but it brings great touches of humor to the movie.Technically, the movie is not surprising, nor is it even brilliant. You bet heavily on CGI, as you'd expect, but it doesn't bring us anything that truly impresses us. Photography is regular, with many action scenes designed to capture the public but become tiring over time. The soundtrack is good, but not particularly good either.In short, it is a summer movie, designed to attract large masses of crowds and crowded box offices, with a foreseeable sequel soon ahead. It's good, it's certainly better than other cartoon movies, but it's not extraordinary.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

totally over-rated,"Grade:  4/10I've now seen this film approximately 30 times, and every time it comes on HBO I watch it, hoping I will like it more than during the previous viewing.  Alas, that is not the case.This film can be viewed as 2 separate parts:  Peter Parker and Spiderman. The Peter Parker portions (say that 3 times real fast) are far and away the superior portion of the film.  I enjoyed Peter's interactions with Mary Jane - Maguire pulls off the shy, nerdy kid really well.  However, his relationship with Norman Osborn (Dafoe) always felt rushed and silly. Osborn tells him at the end, ""I've been like a father to you.""  Huh?  When did that happen, exactly?  They have perhaps 3 conversations throughout the film and they're very brief and businesslike.  I can't really imagine their relationship growing off-screen, either.Another rush-job was Uncle Ben's death.  Peter gets about 1 minute to see his uncle die.  This could have been a very emotional moment in the film but I felt nothing, since their relationship wasn't explored enough, either. I guess it's excusable since the film was already very long, but Peter's relationship with Uncle Ben is what gives birth to Spiderman as we know him, so it should have been highlighted more.  I should mention, however, that the champion of goof, Mr. Stan Lee, has his Spiderman ""tag-line"" appear far too often throughout the film, ""With great power comes great responsibility.""  By the 3rd time I heard this I just groaned.  How melodramatic.Then we come to the 2nd part of the film, the Spiderman portion.  At first everything's great as Peter learns to use his new powers. Unfortunately, it quickly transforms into a goofy-looking cartoon.  I can understand CGI when Spidey is swinging through the streets of NY, but why must we suffer it during street-fight scenes?  Spidey hops and floats around like he's 4 feet tall and fighting on the moon (is he related to Yoda or Gollum?).  No matter how good CGI gets (and it's NOT good, in my opinion, except with junk like spaceships), one thing the effects folks haven't figured out is realistic human dynamic movement and GRAVITY.  Perhaps, however, Raimi wanted Spidey to look like he had jelly-legs with springs inside...but I believe a talented gymnast and some well-choreographed rope-work (see for example the Matrix, but not crud like Charlie's Angels or Romeo Must Die - terrible rope work) would've looked a lot better, say, when Spidey fights off the punks trying to mug Mary Jane in the alley.Last, we come to the Green Goblin, perhaps the corniest villain ever devised (second only to John Travolta's role as Terl in Battlefield Earth?). Everyone raves about Dafoe (and I personally enjoyed him in American Psycho), but he blows it here.  Sad to say I liked Nicholson as the Joker better than Dafoe as the Goblin.  The Goblin's dialogue is CHEESE, even to a five-year old.  Dafoe is much more effective in his Norman Osborn role, when he's talking to himself/the Goblin.  Also, his suit is ultra-goofy (designed for the military?!?!  How about Cirque de Soleil?) and the fact that the mouth on his mask is fixed made me feel like the Goblin's dialogue was overdubbed (maybe it was).  The overall effect is just plain silly.I'm looking forward to Spidey 2, but alas, it looks like the effects will be no better.  Oh, well, there's always Spidey 3, 4, 5...",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spider Man,"Spider-Man is a 2002 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Directed by Sam Raimi from a screenplay by David Koepp, the film is the first film in Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy and stars Tobey Maguire as the title character, as well as Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris. The film chronicles the origins of Spider-Man and his early superhero career. After being bitten by a genetically modified spider, outcast teenage genius Peter Parker develops spider-like superhuman abilities and takes on a masked identity to fight crime and injustice in New York; The action scenes are excellent and exciting, facing off against the evil Green Goblin in the process. In my opinion, it is one of the best Spider-Man series, its editing, acting and effects are amazing, you should definitely watch it before you die or you will miss a lot.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My Childhood Spider!,"""With more power comes more responsibility. This power is my strength as well as a curse. Who am i I'm Spider-Man! ""My age will be 6-7 then. Big brother hears Spider-Man stories from a school friend. When he came home, he painted different colors and told me the story. Most of the time eating! It was seen that two people were eating murdi. The two of us are in a competition to see who can eat more. Suddenly Brother Spider-Man starts telling stories. I ate and listened to the story. On the other hand, the brother gives all the mudar sabar! Not only this, with the help of fire you can do welding.Later, when I saw the movie, I realized that 90% of the stories told by Vaiyar were self-made stories.I saw the first Spider-Man movie when I was 10 years old. The dix of the CD brought the friend who used to hear the story from his friend with great difficulty. The whole movie in two dicks! Spider-Man is the first English movie I've ever seen. Then I would shed tears when I saw Jit's partner, partner, Bandan on the CD!Suddenly watching a superhero movie makes my head spin. People fly with salt! All this was only in the face of the brother. This time it has come from the mouth to the skin of the TV. I stared blankly. I don't understand who is saying what, what is happening in the story. Just keep looking.On the contrary, I see Spider's famous kiss. But I don't understand that it is a kiss. I tell my brother. He doesn't understand or doesn't understand me. Vaiyar was also the first movie. Many people in this country learned about kissing by watching English movies.Being a villager, there was a lot of load shedding throughout the day. Once the CD remote was damaged. The CD button had already stopped working. These were wasted when they came to our house as second hand.I was often seen watching the movie Spider-Man. So the remote was lost, so I had to sit down and watch. Shodsheding when the name could be seen almost finished! After an hour, I would actually sit down and watch the current rise again. There is no counting how many times I have seen the movie like this. Maybe see more but Dix took his owner.After watching the movie, my brother and I used to wander in the forest of the village looking for colorful spiders. When I found the colored ones, I would gently hold them and leave them on my body. And I waited for him to give me his famous bite. My brother used to draw a huge spider on his chest with a pen and walk around. Our misfortune or good fortune is that no spider has been bitten yet.I never saw that movie when I was a child. Today I sat down after so many years. I got the idea about the story of the movie now. Then I would just stare. I did not understand the story. I used to call Green Goblin Green Man as a child. Till yesterday I knew him as Green Man! I have been sitting with so many more mistakes for so long. I should have sat down with the mistakes. Childhood misinformation also seems as colorful as a rainbow. Beniyasahkala childhood!Everything about being involved with childhood is wonderful. This movie released in 2002 is so wonderful! This is the Spider-Man of love. Like Spider-Man. Leaving the spider on my body to become my brave Spider-Man. Spider-Man learning to kiss upside down.

The special effects were excellent but it was too violent,"The movie was very good but I only rated it as a 7 because of the violence. I realize that the whole idea of the movie is good versus evil and good triumphs over evil, but the kind of violence it portrays is the kind that I believe causes young people to become insensitive to the feelings of others and to the idea of death and suffering as being the ultimate bad ending.  I will not take my 10 year old son to see it because of the violence.  It is the kind where the villain laughs while he visits his evil on innocent people.  Movies like Jurassic Park where the violence is another species attacking man is different.  It is kind of the survival on mankind, man against nature.  But violence by man against man is a whole different kind and the kind that I think is bad for young minds.I would like to see more movies where man is seen as good.  Where the conflict is directed in a more positive way; not just kill or be killed. Not just retaliate against violence with more violence.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Another Great Marvel Comic Movie.,"I meant to review this months ago when I had (by great luck) managed to attend the premiere in Los Angeles.  Regardless, with a ""better late than never"" attitude, this has turned out to be one of Summer 2002's bright spots in an incredibly busy movie season.As it stands, ""Spider-Man"" has all the right elements: A real comic book ""feel"" to it, an excellent Danny Elfman score, Tobey Maguire as a totally believable Peter Parker (with just the right amounts of shyness and the ""old Parker luck""), an appropriately sinister Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin, and a scene-stealing performance by J. K. Simmons as the cigar-chomping J. Jonah Jameson.  That's a character that should have been used more in the movie, as he was a lot of fun to see in action.  Here's hoping for more screen time in the next one.There wasn't a lot that I didn't like about this movie.  I still didn't like the Green Goblin costume as much as I tried to, the organic web-shooters didn't bother me half as much as I had figured (perhaps as they weren't overplayed as being so), and while Kirsten Dunst didn't do a bad job as Mary Jane, she just never really captured the ""look"" of what I though the character should be.As for the ""goods"" of the film, the battles were perfectly set up as comic-cook style brawls, with plenty of exaggerated movements and situations.  When Spider-Man web-swung through the streets of New York (love the costume), I couldn't help but get a chilled sense of awe that I originally felt after seeing the first trailer last year.  And the character relationships were great.  ""Spider-Man"" the comic has always been as much about the man behind the mask as it is about the hero.  I'm so relieved that Sam Raimi took noticeable attempts to balance the two.Despite its comic-book origins, the last battle is pretty intense, comparably so to the Tim Burton ""Batman"" films.  And the Green Goblin's scare tactics even made myself jump a few times.  So parents with very little ones may want to check out the film first to see if the kids can handle it.  But in that regard, I'm glad Raimi took the film seriously enough to not let it delve into the lame campiness that was ""Batman & Robin"".  And I'm really glad that they didn't take too many liberties with the Spider-Man origin to remove the emotional impact that it carried throughout the film.As a movie, it retained all of the wonder, excitement and fun that has endeared me to Spider-Man since I was a kid.  As a super-hero film, I can compare it to the orignal ""Batman"" and ""Superman"" films in its high-quality treatment.  I will wait impatiently for the feature-packed (I hope) DVD, and will have faith that the next installment of the series will be as rewarding as this one was.  A must see.  A fun movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"overhyped, overrated, and nowhere near the comic book classics!","Spiderman with a 7.6 rating amazing! Some kids definitely loved this movie and obviously voted with a vengeance just like phantom menace!Unfortunately no amount of scoring will hide the truth, spiderman is a mediocre film. For adults who like to think and appreciate good movies, this is nowhere near well done. Yes, Toby Maguire, Daniel Dafoe, and Kirsten Dunst were good. But I cannot say the same about the direction of Sam Raimi.Spiderman had enormous potential...but the way it was done, it was probably catered to 8 year olds!First, ""with great power comes great responsibility"" is a rip-off from the Superman film where Superman's father tells him the same thing, and there are numerous sequences where the director didn't have the imagination nor the intelligence to bring something unique to spiderman ripping a lot of the scenes. The costume of green goblin was awful, I can't believe they did this in 2003 rather than 1950! The fight scenes are boring and unrealistic, climaxing in that bridge scene which was oh so predictable.So disappointing. 2/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A decent beginning to the summer blockbuster season.,"I will start by saying that I have never been a Spiderman fan, I have always been partial to Superman and Batman. But I'm always open to a comic book hero brought to the big screen. Sam Raimi has made a movie that I feel will appeal to most people, it is fun, brisk, and never takes itself too seriously. Toby Maguire is good as Peter Parker/Spiderman. He brings the appropriate sensibility to his role, Willem Dafoe does what he can with what he is given as the Green Goblin, but it is too little, I wish they would have fleshed out his villainous  character. The special effects are good, but I believe that they are  intentionally cheesy. The action scenes are done well, but nothing that hasn't been seen before.If there is a problem is exactly that, the action is not particularly unique, the scenes are done well but there isn't really any memorable shots or things that the audience would be wowed by. I would say that the non action stuff in the movie is more entertaining. The first hour when Peter is discovering his powers is especially entertaining.

This Spider-Man film from 2002 is still my favorite blockbuster,"""With great power, comes great responsibility.""

Willem Dafoe was brilliant and scary playing the Green Goblin. I liked his evil laugh. The Green Goblin is my favorite villain in Marvel. Kristen Dunst is beautiful as Mary Jane Watson. The film had dark moments and I liked them. Danny Elfman's composing is beyond incredible. There were some scenes that made me emotionally sad. I still liked the action. When I watched the film it was like watching Spider-Man: The Animated Series from 1994.I saw Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man 3. The last two films were dark with Doctor Octopus and Venom.

lack of style...,"I don't know... I seem to be one of the only people here that didn't really enjoy the film.  It was okay but...

Maybe because I was deceive of not finding in the screening the richfuls colours of the preview, or maybe was I just deceive because the Green Goblin looks like a Power Ranger... This movie is a great blockbuster but it was done knowing that it would be a sucess.  What I mean is that the preproduction (the Green Goblin again, what Mary Jane -where's Gwen Stacy?- wears (expensive clothes there for the girl-next-door) and the postproduction (people go crazy on the effects but look a Peter Parker when he jumps from building to building before he have the suit and all the CG scenes that have the Green Goblins, they look like FX done for the TV...) where done too quickly.

Swing baby swing!,"Sam Raimi has created one enjoyable ride.  It seems without question after watching Spider-man that Raimi is a comic book fan.  This film litteraly plays out like the so many paneled stories in the Spiderman series, and even the shots look like art work taken from many of the books.  A particular shot of Spider-man getting hit with a grenade seems like a drawing lifted from the artists pages.The casting is quite good.  Maguire who is usualy bad as a leading man excels here cause Peter Parker is a young kid who is cocky yet very unsure about the weight and burden now put on him with his new superpowers.  This forces Maguire to take the role of a person who doesn't have a lot of confidence but must do what is right, and it suits him very well.  Dunst is fine as Mary Jane, and who can't like Dafoe as the Green Goblin.Also while I knew the story of Spiderman's origin, Raimi gives the audience plenty of suspense in telling the already familiar story.  Some of the acting between Mary Jane and Parker is a bit contrived, maybe sometimes even a little long winded, but at least they have a chemistry on screen.  It also looks like they created the most memorable on screen kiss this year so far...Also the swinging special effects look neat, can't say I've seen anything like it before and it's very refreshing.

A lot of fun. Definitely,"It's with a mixed feeling of different expectations I sit down in the cinema to watch SPIDER-MAN. I had a hope to see a Great Superheroflick, in the same class as Tim Burton's masterpiece BATMAN (1989). Then I had this more realistic spidersense telling me that ""you know, this'll probably be a lot of fun, but really nothing else"". Well, my sense was more right than my hopes, but ""a lot of fun"" is kind of an understatement; It's REALLY a lot of fun watching SPIDER-MAN.First off, there is two things that made me want to see this film;1. As a kid Spidey was my idol, and Marvel my heaven. This resulted in me knowing state-of-the-art-geek-stuff for the rest of my life. Therefore when time came for ""Spidey the movie"", my ancient knowledge sparked to life, at least for a while, and for just a couple of hours I was all back to my 11-year-old-mania.2. My favorite director, Sam Raimi isn't, but I have faith in the man and I trust him to make a fun flick. As a horrorfan his THE EVIL DEAD (1982) remains more or less as a gift. His directing is wild and crazy, unstoppable but therefore also guaranteed to float out of the frames. But I heard Raimi would be a bit more down-to-earth, in SPIDER-MAN. Well that sounded good.Indeed, Raimi doesn't get all that carried away, even though the movie ooze from his fun directing manners. If you've seen DARKMAN (1990) or ARMY OF DARKNESS (1993) you'll see that SPIDER-MAN has the same crazed tempo. Of course BRUCE CAMPBELL does a semi-cameo, Raimi holds up his traditions. Yeah, about the actors, SPIDER-MAN's lineup gives us three stars in the leading roles, Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe and Kirsten Dunst. They are no real favs of mine, but it's a good combination: all three of them are just about as OK actors. Dafoe did his thing, Dunst was cute (as always), I think Maguire stood out making Peter Parker a truly sympathetic character. Of course, to make an a-lot-of-fun-actionadventure these days requires some heavy artilleries from the digital front. True, the digital effects are slick and perfect for the entertainment-meter. When Spidey swings around Manhattan, I can't do nothing else but kick off my shoes (I literary did this) and lean back and just enjoy the ride. 'Cause that is what you gotta do in a movie like this. Forget that it contains two love-declarations, one from Maguire and one from Dunst, that are absolutely ridiculous (and that the dialogues overall are no hotshots). Then you'll have a lot of fun. My rating is 7/10, a bit of a challanger to BATMAN RETURNS (1992) and proving that BATMAN (1989) still is the best.Buy the way. There is a Spider-Man 2 and 3 coming up. Good idea. This movie was very true to the comicbook it was based on, but Spidey lacked his unresistable wits and some of the stuff that are basic to the Spidey-reader are not yet shown off in the movie. Hopefully we'll see more of this in the sequels. Even though I wonder... Sam Neill as DocOc? Bring in Eddie Brock!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
nice try,"i couldn't be called a 'fan' of spider-man, but i've read my share of the comics when i was a kid. the movie certainly followed the early phases of spidey to the letter, but it still failed to really entertain me. or maybe because.tobey maguire is a great talented actor, but didn't appear (to me) as anywhere near peter parker the comic character. same goes to willem dafoe and james franco...however all of them did a good job. willem dafoe's mirror scene is outstanding. the best performance i saw was kirsten dunst as mary jane. too bad her role was mainly to scream while hanging on rooftops.there was some interesting dialogue, between mary jane and peter parker especially, but mainly the dialogue was trash, example being peter quoting his uncle in the most cheesy way possible. i didn't like the city scenes where spider-man moves from building to building, the computer animation is just too visible and tacky (in todays standards). green goblin was never my 'favorite' bad guy when i was reading these comics, the movie goblin actually seemed better to me. some of the fighting scenes are good stuff to watch even if you wouldn't like spider-man. infact, the fight scenes and mr. osborn's mental scenes were surprisingly brutal, i thought this was mainly a kid movie. the music of the movie was simply irritating hollywood orchestral thing. in the part of unexpected darkness, better than i expected, but still another superhero boom time creation. everybody wants to make a superhero movie now, hopefully we get a decent one one day, too. this one goes to the short list of the 'nice try's' (this is a good thing) along with tim burton's 'batman returns'. looking forward to seeing what daredevil is made of. at least then i get to see one of my favorite actors colin farrell playing one of my twisted childhood's hero figures, BULLSEYE :)",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My first love in superhero movies,"The superhero movie that started it all and made me love superheroes ever since. Spider-Man is a ground breaking, web-spinning epic! A film that tackles the heart and soul of a classic well known superhero comic book that issued in 1962 (Amazing Fantasy 15) Sam Raimi knew what he was doing to honor the creators and fans of this character and Tobey Maguire, Rosemary Harris, Cliff Robertson, William Dafoe, James Franco, and Kirsten Dunst killed it playing those characters. This is a must watch classic!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Excellent escape from reality,"Yep, I'm a former comic book nerd. Yes, I read Spider-Man and countless other Marvel Comics. Yes, I thought the movie was freakin' awesome! I can hear other people now: ""They used too many computer effects,"" ""That's not the way Spider-Man is in the comics,"" and other worthless statements designed to bring down the movie. Remember this people: MOVIES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FUN! I hate when people bash movies because the plot was bad, or the camera work was awful, because the point of movies is to watch them and escape from the real world for a while. You are supposed to identify with the characters as they go through their struggles, and this movie does that extremely well in its serious manner. No, wisecracks were not heard from Spider-Man, because this film is more serious than the cocky kid in the comics. Because this film is about struggles, and how we mature into the people we're supposed to be.That said, I can get to the real meat and potatoes.  In my opinion, Tobey Maguire is the only person that could have pulled off both the geeky Peter Parker and the super-slick web-slinger  the way this film demands. I would not believe someone like Ben Affleck as Peter, because most other actors considered don't have the soul in their acting that Tobey does. Nor would I have believed another actress could play Mary Jane Watson as well as Kirsten Dunst. Any other redheads (Alyson Hannigan of Buffy fame comes to mind, for one) just wouldn't have been as good as showing emotion and making the part so believable. Yeah, anyone can scream, but it's the small scenes between the action that give this movie its good marks, and the actors selected did their jobs better than anyone else that I can imagine in those roles.Yes, there is some humor in this serious flick. The typecasting of J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson was an extremely good choice. I could not stop laughing during these scenes, because they both portray the comic character so well and provide the needed breaks in seriousness. Every movie needs a little humor, and the few scenes Simmons did saw him stealing the show.OK, so maybe you're skeptical. No, the plot wasn't straight out of the comic books. It wasn't supposed to be. Yes, they modified the story. But would you believe a high school science could make a web fluid from common materials that surpasses even our industrial technology forty years after the comic was written? No, don't delude yourself. And don't bash the movie because it may not live up to your expectations. It satisfies its purpose: it reaches the audience emotionally and teaches them a certain point: ""With great power comes great responsibility.""",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
should of used the theme song from the sixties cartoon...,"well i sorta enjoyed the movie. having read a fair number of spider hyphen man comics in my younger days made the first part of the movie (about the origins of spidey) a bit boring. only after spidey is seen in his trademark superhero threads do the movie start to get a little more lively.after initially viewing the trailer showing helicopter caught in the giant spider web, i figured they were just going to make a cartoony adaptation but fortunately director sam raimi managed to make the characters realistic and believable for the most part. the special effects however, were a bit of mixed bag. the most bothersome part was having spidey perpetually swinging through the city streets by shooting his webbing seemingly into the sky... kinda reminded me of the corny spiderman cartoon of the 60s.overall not a bad start, hopefully the next installment will be more action oriented.rating :6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Set the standard for superhero movies,"I remember this movie fondly as I was a big Spiderman fan of the Marvel comic in the 1970s. I just spent a Wednesday afternoon watching it again after many years ad now that I have the perspective of the Marvel productions that came after it I must say it holds up well. Really well.All the Marvel movies suffer from the same problems. The standard origin story leads to a showdown with the big bad guy in which the hero just manages to prevail. Toss in multiple fistfights and generous doses of CGI and you have the basic standard thing repeated for each character. There's little else to it.But the 2002 Spiderman was woven around a human drama and a large part of the movie concentrated on that. Tobey McGuire was a perfect choice for the lead character. He played the nerd loser who had real heart and cared for his aunt and uncle while in love with Mary Jane. That gave us something to cheer for besides just the battles with the bad guy. It led to several great scenes as well as the now iconic kiss. Willem Dafoe was excellent as well giving the Green Goblin a human side as well as a really scary villain. And JK Simmons killed it.The subsequent Marvel movies really lack in any true character development. They were fun to watch for a while and it was impressive how they coordinated all those movies to resolve in the last Avengers movie. But I'm burned out on this approach. I can't imagine seeing another one.The 2002 Spiderman and the next sequel were terrific. The third installment, not so much.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

ICONIC,"""With great power, comes great responsibility."" This is a film about how Peter Parker learned that lesson. Because of that and some scenes, this movie is so comic accurate. In the very first Spider-Man comic book, everything was about that lesson too. Also, in opening sequence of movie Peter says it is all about a girl. That's so true too! But about love, there are some stuff which is so cheesy in that film. Actually it has some more creepy stuff but in the great tempo and editing of the film they are not necessary to think about. Sam Raimi and writers did an amazing job on storytelling and introducing characters. Everything characters do have some reasons; we see what they do, why they do and connection between previous and next acts of characters. Cast is fantastic. I love Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man, he is still my best hero because of my childhood. Also, there is someone who steals the show every time: J.K. Simmons. He is fabulous! On the other hand, there is something this movie have which newest Spidey movies don't: Iconic scenes. Remarkable things are happening in that story. Some of them lovely, some of them brutal and some of them exciting.

"Come on, it wasn't THAT great.","As one of the most anticipated movies of the past few decades, fans (myself included) were really holding their breath for a phenominal film.  Now that it's finally out, people are giving it all sorts of praise, but come on, it was OK, but there have been better comic book movies, such as the first Batman or even X-Men.For those of us that know the origin story, the first half of the movie was all familiar territory, but it was still somewhat entertaining.  I felt like the major flaw in the film was the introduction and use of the Green Goblin, I felt like he was underdeveloped and uninteresting.  Once he avenged the corporate downfall of Norman Osborn, he just wanted to blow stuff up for the sake of mayhem.  Then he fought Spider-Man a few times, including once where he knocked him unconscious and didn't bother to take his mask off (what??). The reason I think both Batman and X-Men were better films is because the characters, villains especially, were more developed, more interesting, and took more interesting courses of action.Perhaps I would think Spider-Man is a great film if I was ten years younger, but today I have to give it the old ""OK"" rating.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not bad I suppose,"Well, this film has its good points and bad points, the action sequences are well done and up to when Peter Parker actually 'becomes' Spider-Man it's actually a pretty good film.However from there it descends into the type of bland movie that usually would go straight to video. This film features some of the most awkward and just plain bad acting I have seen in a big budget film, the scene in the hospital between Parker and MJ makes me wince every time I see it, in fact I just skip right past.And the less we mention about the atrocious ""New York coming together"" scene at the bridge the better, it made me laugh out loud in the cinema.As for the Green Goblin, without the suit Dafoe excels as the bad guy, and is wonderful, but once he dons that green armour, he turns into the type of caricature you expect to see in a Saturday morning cartoon.Overall, this film isn't too bad, although I haven't really said many nice things about it, but the whole middle section of the film would be better left out, but thankfully in the age of the DVD we have the skip button.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Humorless,"This is strictly a by-the-numbers plot, and utterly lacks visual flair (""Star Wars"" had more convincing special effects, and it's 25 years older!).

Toby McGuire's ""flat"" performances have worked well in other movies, but he has been miscast here: this rendition of Peter Parker/Spiderman is utterly humorless.

"Good, but could have been better","Ahh Spiderman.  Could this movie live up to it's potential?  Well in my opinion sort of.  One of the stronger points in the movie, which you don't see in many comic book/fantasy text to theater translations is the emphasis on the on the background of the charecters.  That was not so in this film. Im not going to get into specifics, but the transition was well done. On acting.  I believe Toby Maguire did an excellent  job portraying Peter Parker, perfect for that role.  Then on the other hand as spiderman you are probably wondering if he would suit that position. Well in my opinion he really didnt need to.  The role of spiderman was more of stunts and computer generated sequences, so in the end it works out for his part.  William Dafoe, couldn't have picked a better person to play green goblin,  his voice, his facial expressions. Perfect. Now Kirsten Dunst, I didn't really picture her as the MJ type, and I'm still not really sure if she was really the best one for the job.  She did, on the other hand, do a decent job.The action scenes were alright.  Just alright.  At times the enviorment was so visibly computer generated, it felt as if I was watching a cartoon and really took away from the feeling of the scene.

Good kid flick,"Don't go to this movie expecting a balanced mix of ""adult"" fun with ""kid"" action.  The plot (while very authentic to the original) is thin and the motivations of the characters is child-like.  The live-action fight scenes seemed clumsy and amaturish in comparison to the computer-generated parts. I was a big fan of the Spidey cartoons when I was a kid, but unfortunately this movie tended to feel too much like watching the same cheezy cartoons except with a sexy leading lady.  (Compare it for example to X-Men, which didn't have the same cheezy feel but still was a great action flick for a broader age group).  Tobey Maguire did great as a boy-next-door, but playing the action hero was a stretch and in my mind was not able to quite pull it off.

"Willem Dafoe was born on July 22nd, 1955","Sam Raimi's Spider-Man (2002), like Bryan Singer's X-Men (2000), owes a lot to Tim Burton's Batman (1989). Those reasons are obvious and don't even need to be pointed out, but also for music composer Danny Elfman. Danny Elfman revolutionized the comic book soundtrack when he did Batman (1989). At the same time, the Simpsons (1989-present), started airing on FOX, with his legendary theme song, thus sealing his style of music into the pop-culture conscience. It doesn't stop there. In the 13 years between the two movies, Elfman would eventually do Edward Scissorhands (1990), Mission Impossible (1996) and Men in Black (1997), just to name a few. It is Elfman's music that catapults this film right out of the gate with the beginning credits, totally channeling, but not copying, the music from Batman (1989).From there, Sam Raimi finally gives web-head his cinematic due, by showing the world, that a man can walk on walls. With a huge budget, an excellent cast and the best special effects available for 2002, this film became part of the new millennium's superhero, comic book, film momentum, that paved the way to the MCU of today. This film appealed to the general public, as well as the comic book fans. Sam Raimi had captured a spark, which would spread even more in the sequel, Spider-Man 2 (2004), which is even better than this one. This film should still be viewed first, always, before watching the sequel. It needs to be, because of its importance to film. Not just for its importance to the comic-book film, but it also played a huge part in film history as well. You can skip Spider-Man 3 (2007), if you want to.8.7 (B+ MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Still a delightful start to the Spider-Man series.,"The story pulls you in from the start with its voice over narration from Peter Parker and the opening credits.

Most of the visuals seem convincing, but the closeups of Spider-Man look too much like a computer effect with very shiny gloss on the costume. Some of the scenes when the characters are in danger and are falling look like it's on a blue screen, but the webs flying out of his wrists and Green Goblin's attacks on others are realistic from his hovercraft to the various weapons he uses.

All the subtlety of a sledgehammer...,"... but that's OK in a comic book film.  Perhaps unfortunately, this has all been done before in the first couple ""Batman"" films, and the first couple ""Superman"" films.  The entire movie carried a weight of ""haven't I seen this scene before?"" over and over again.I'm a great fan of the original ""Spiderman"" series of comic books (which I read avidly as a kid), but I have to agree with Ebert on this one -- the action just looks unrealistic.  A physical body cannot move that quickly or smoothly, defying the laws of space, time and gravity.  That took a lot of fun out of the action sequences for me.The plot itself is interesting and involving, but *very* rehashed from a number of other superhero-type movies.  Nary an original moment in the entire running-time of the film... nothing genuinely creative at all. ""Spiderman cereal"" will probably leave a sweeter taste in your mouth.My conclusion is that I can't recommend you pay US$7.50 to see this one in the theater, unless you honestly loved the recent ""Planet of the Apes"" remake and the two ""Mummy"" films.  Wait for the DVD release (rumored to be in November 2002 I think), the film will look just as good (if not better) on the small screen.This movie is NOT a blockbuster... see the 1978 version of ""Superman"" if you want superhero action, it out-does this film in every conceivable aspect (even the special effects category).6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"They're all beautiful, until they're snarling after your trust fund like a pack of ravening wolves","Sam Raimi's 'Spider-Man' is a strong origin movie for the famous superhero.The story packs quite a lot into its running time, with background stories to several characters whilst developing a fairly good confrontation between protagonist and antagonist.How Peter Parker becomes the titular hero is exceptionally well done and this transformation links well to themes of adolescence and transition into adulthood. The dialogue exchanges with his family are some of the standout moments for me.The scenes between Parker/Spidey and MJ are some of the best exchanges between romantically linked characters in the superhero genre. Both dialogue and visuals are wonderful, with Kirstin Dunst and Toby Maguire having great chemistry.For me the weakest aspect is the writing and design of the Green Goblin. Willem Dafoe, as always, gives a fantastic performance, and Sam Raimi makes the best out of the concept, but there is a pretty weak and rushed backstory and the costume does not work on screen. I do though like the surrogate father aspect of the character.I think the visual storytelling is strong, with great cinematography, editing and special effects.

The most of the integrated action scenes seemed to be like a video game or an animated film for kids. Okay the actors did her job at partly well and the film has some good plots. There were some unexplained situations like how Mr.Osborne turned in a bad guy but finally you have to accept that it is a comic story and that`s really all. It is too overrated. 6/10.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
With great power...,"A comic book adaptation from director Sam Raimi, starring Tobey Maguire in the titular role. The acting all around is great, but Willem Dafoe is superb as the Green Goblin!

Awesome,"Have a very vague memory of watching this in my childhood and loving it to the fullest.Rewatching in lockdown and was wondering if I would still love it or it would be too amateurish for me now. And it still is one of my favourites.The CGI forms a major part of the movie but it still has so much human element in it. The dialogues are great and the action is top-notch.The whole story on paper looks too simple with the basic structure of hero-villain-beautiful woman-happy ending type, and predictable too, but it is so well done and beautifully shot that you are interested to watch it till the end.Maybe it is not in the same league as The Dark Knight trilogy but this franchise was the one that drove me towards the fascinating superhero fictionalized world.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Movie That Got Me Into Superhero Movies.,"I like some superhero movies, but it's hard for me to love them. I have a few favorites(Spider Man 2 is my favorite thanks to Roger Ebert), but I have a tendency to not be thrilled by them.I like Tim Burton's Batman movies and Spider Man: Homecoming for instance, but I feel that overall are rather empty. By that, I mean they are good but I don't leave ""satisfied"", if that makes sense.Either the story is undermined and the action is overdone or I don't feel that the action is done right. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, for example, has many flaws and too much action in the last half hour.Because of this, I have only seen a handful of superhero movies. This was actually the first PG-13 movie I ever saw(At about 7 or 8), but I left it for many years and re-visited it when I was 19, nearly 2 years ago.As I got older, I could actually appreciate what Sam Raimi did with Spider Man's origin story. It takes about half the movie for Spider Man to show up, and until then we get to know Peter Parker as a human: a bullied nerd, close to his aunt and uncle, in love with his next door neighbor, etc. Even with spider powers, he is still a kid.That's one thing I enjoy about this movie, and especially the 2nd one. Sam Raimi takes a cartoony character and fleshes him out to make him relate-able.The action is exciting as well, since it comes in when it is necessary and it's not over-blown.There's nothing about the acting I can't complain about as well. Tobey Maguire is a great Spider-Man. He's fine in Sea biscuit and The Great Gatsby, but he's great in this. Willem Defoe is fantastic as The Green Goblin, a Mr. Hyde type character that becomes Spider Man's nemesis. That's his best role since Jesus in The Last Temptation of Christ.Of course there are also the actresses Rosemary Harris and Kristen Dunst, and a young James Franco as well.What Spider Man therefore delivers is a fun plot, good action scenes and great acting performances, all balanced very well. The sequel is better, but this is still an excellent origin story that was very much worth telling.Note: This review was originally written on 4/16/19, and has been re-edited and re-posted. I intend to review Spider Man 2 and 3 next.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A gem in the superhero genre deserving of its royalty status,"My daughter and I recently enjoyed watching Spider-Man (2002) on Netflix. The story revolves around Peter Parker, who lives with his aunt and uncle and secretly harbors a crush on his neighbor, Mary Jane, believing she doesn't notice him. However, when Peter is bitten by a radioactive spider during a class field trip, he gains superpowers that could finally catch Mary Jane's attention. Simultaneously, his best friend's growing animosity towards his father sets the stage for a potential super villain's emergence.Directed by the iconic Sam Raimi (The Evil Dead), the film features a stellar cast, including Tobey Maguire (The Great Gatsby), Kirsten Dunst (Melancholia), Willem Dafoe (Platoon), James Franco (127 Hours), Cliff Robertson (Escape from the Condor), Rosemary Harris (Before the Devil knows You're Dead) and J. K. Simmons (Juno).Spider-Man boasts a perfectly cast ensemble that excels in portraying the relationships within Spider-Man's universe. The circumstances leading to Uncle Ben's tragic demise, the rise of the Green Goblin, and Peter's relationship with Mary Jane are all beautifully depicted. Kirsten Dunst shines as the quintessential girl next door, despite some peculiar wigs, and the action sequences are nothing short of tremendous. The Macy's Day parade battle is a standout moment, and every web-swinging scene deserves a 10/10 rating. The CGI and soundtrack are top-notch, and who can resist a Bruce Campbell cameo? My only gripe lies with the Green Goblin suit, which falls short of the character's potential, despite Willem Dafoe's excellent portrayal as the villain.In conclusion, Spider-Man is a true gem in the superhero genre, deserving of its royalty status. I would give it a solid 9/10 and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking an action-packed and emotionally engaging cinematic experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Webheads rejoice!,"Spiderman has always been one of the most compelling superheroes because of his basic normalcy and goodness. Sam Raimi does a great job of letting the audience know who Peter Parker is and why he does what he does. It is far less of a psychological stretch than the Bruce Wayne/Batman alter-ego. Speaking on the ""Dark Knight"", I would rate this film on par with the first ""Batman"" movie. It had decent performances all around, although I didn't feel anyone reached the level of Jack Nicholson's ""Joker"". Dafoe gives it a shot. Cliff Robertson lends a touch of class to the proceedings. Tobey Maguire is perfectly cast as Peter Parker, he starts out as a good-hearted but nerdy teenager and becomes more and more confident and has a lot of fun with his super-powers.I don't know if the ""Green Goblin"" was the best choice of villain but it works well for Spidey to have a nemesis that challenges him intellectually and well and physically. We mustn't forget that Peter is highly intelligent and I think a disservice was done by not letting him develop his own we-shooters. Still the movie was fun and should dominate the box-office this weekend.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
With great power (139 million) comes great responsibility (Raimi),"SpidermanThere is a scene in director Sam Raimi's Spiderman which pays homage to a film of his past, Evil Dead II.  The scene I am describing is where Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) first tests out his powers, as he jumps from building to building in street clothes, inexperienced.  When he gets the hang of his powers, he designs his costume meticulously.  This scene is a spiritual homage to Evil Dead II's Ash, as he builds his chainsaw weapon and saws the barrel off of his shotgun.And with this, Raimi and Maguire break free of constraints in the film. Maguire's Peter Parker is larger than the movie.  He seemingly lives in his own world, where he freely interacts with what goes on around him.  Young, in love, and going through a life-changing experience, Maguire fills Spiderman with wonder and excitement.  And many critics thought he would not be able to do it.A film adaptation of Spiderman was long thought an impossible, daring feat. Although Superman, Batman, and X-Men have come before this film, Peter Parker was always the most human of all comic-book characters.  Bruce Wayne was a bloodthirsty vigilante.  Clark Kent was a larger-than-life man with very little weaknesses.  The X-Men were un-human characters who relied on each other for strength in battle.  Parker has no alliance, only a sense of duty and responsibility.  Raimi's Spiderman (which cost roughly 139 million to produce, plus marketing) is a film that shows the struggle of a young man, tackling many responsibilities with an actual concern for his family, friends, and even the strangers he protects.After being bitten by a genetically altered spider during a class field trip, Parker begins changing.  He goes to bed sick and wakes up healthy.  He no longer needs his glasses.  He has muscles.  But what sets him physically apart from other healthy people are his strange abilities: he sprouts small hairs on his hands with allow him to climb walls and his wrists have mutated into web-spinning devices.  His new powers not only allow him the chance to make some money for himself, whether through wrestling or taking photos of himself, but they also offer the chance to win Mary Jane over, which he will try to do several times throughout the movie.When Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) dies, Peter must re-evaluate his life. Some of Ben's last words to Peter were `With great power comes great responsibility.'  This becomes Peter's mantra.  It defines what kind of a hero he will become and how he will treat those around him.  Saddened by his uncle's death, Peter Parker does indeed become a hero.  The people of New York grow to love him.  Crooks, criminals, and enemies fear him.While all of this happens to Peter Parker, filthy-rich businessman Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe) is facing some harsh realities.  If Oscorp, his company, loses a military contract from the government, the he will be finished.  Determined not to let this happen, he experiments his company's new serum on himself.  A horrible accident ensues, which leaves Osborne as the multi-personalitied Green Goblin.  The Green Goblin is set on destroying the competition, and does just that.Osborne's son Harry (James Franco) is Parker's best friend.  And when the Green Goblin learns that Parker may be Spiderman, a game of cat-and-mouse ensues.  The Goblin cheezily terrorizes New York.  He destroys J. Jonah Jameson's (J.K. Simmons) offices, hospitalizes Parker's aunt May (), and takes Mary Jane hostage.  But instead of coming off as a twisted villain with clear goals, Dafoe's Goblin soon degrades into a cheesy, poor man's Jack Nicholson as the Joker.  The Green Goblin is neither scary, nor menacing.  He's cheesy.  As cheesy as the skeleton army in Raimi's Army of Darkness, even.  Dafoe as the human Osborne is good, but as the mutant Green Goblin, he's bad.  Quite possibly, the Green Goblin is what keeps Spider-man from being a great movie.  While Tobey Maguire is very believable in his role, Willem Dafoe is not.  Dafoe gets considerably less screen time, but his tongue-in-cheek insults and varied actions come off as second-rate and hold the movie back.Still, the movie has its share of positive moments.  The entire first half is great.  Maguire flawlessly transforms into the wall-crawler.  The supporting cast, particularly J.K. Simmons as media mogul J. Jonah Jameson and Dunst as Mary Jane are very good as well.  The second half, while not degrading into a cheese-fest entirely, has some great moments.  Spidey, as he swings through his urban jungle, is portrayed exhilaratingly.  Good money was spent on decent special effects, most of which take place in the second half.  Unfortunately, though, the film does not contain its magic throughout the entire movie.  And in the end, Parker is the only character to learn a lesson and then live it: with great power comes great responsibility.Grade: B",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Role of spiderman in movie,"Considered as one of the most successful superhero movies ever made, SpiderMan is a superhero film adaptation of one of Stan Lee's most popular Marvel comics, and becoming one of the first movies to score the highest opening weekend in the box office. There's no wonder, because this is an exciting and enjoyable motion picture. One of my childhood favorites, to be exact! This movie tells the origin story of Peter Parker, or Spider-Man, portrayed by Tobey Maguire, whom after being bit by a radioactive spider, he has gained extraordinary powers to climb walls, shoot web, and beat bad guys. But all that must be put to the test when Parker has to defeat one of the first villains of the Spider-Man universe, the Green Goblin, portrayed by Willem Dafoe. Although Maguire is somewhat bland in a few of his movies, I respected that he fit the role of Peter Parker perfectly, playing a shy kid, with no powers to either beat the bad guy or win the girl. Although given some of the corniest lines of dialouge in this movie, Kirsten Dunst makes an adorable portrayal as Mary Jane Watson, while giving a great chemistry with her co-star. But, Willem Dafoe seems a little miscast playing the deadly Green Goblin, feeling more like he's suitable for drama, instead of action. Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and J. K. Simmons, round up the supporting cast, bringing some memorable performances on-screen, especially Simmons, who steals every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson, the angry editor chief of the Daily Bugle. There are few corny and goofy moments from here and there, but that doesn't stop the exciting momentum that this movie brings. Filled with impressive visual effects and a wonderful music score by Danny Elfman, director Sam Raimi perfectly stays true to the original Spider-Man concept, and delivers plenty of exciting action sequences that are both fun to watch, and stay true to the plot. Behind ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Avengers"", ""Spider-Man"" is probably my third favorite superhero movie. I can watch this movie over and over again, and it's still a fun time. I was easily impressed with this movie, and it never disappoints to entertain. Everyone will find something to enjoy for sure.

"Good At Times, Bad At Times!","All in all, I enjoyed the motion picture version of Spiderman.  It is good summer entertainment that is sure to dominate the box office  (at least until Episode II, Men In Black II, Minority Report, Goldmember, etc. are released).  Nonetheless, I have several complaints.  First, the filmmakers relied too much on special efx for the fight sequences.  Obviously, when Spiderman swings from skyscrapers special efx are completely necessary, and I have no problem with this.  But the scenes of Spiderman kicking anus on bad guys should be filmed with martial arts experts.  It would make them look much cooler in my opinion.  Besides, it would not be hard to put a Jet Li type under the costume.  In addition, maybe this is just me but I am sick of all action films trying to imitate The Matrix.  If I see another slow motion, back bending hero dodge bullets (or whatever) I think I'm going to throw-up.  Anyway, my second major complaint is the cheesiness of the dialogue.  The scenes between Mary Jane & Peter Parker are so slow and drawn out that their often painful.  Hint to the filmmakers: Don't force the sentimentality on the audience, it's not effective.  Pearl Harbor proved this last summer.  Also, the scene with the New Yorkers attacking the Green Goblin in defense of Spiderman is ridiculous.  I'm guessing the filmmakers completely reworked that scene after September 11 to show their support for New York.  Though it's a nice gesture, it is not needed in this film. After reading this review you probably think I hated the movie since most of my comments seem negative.  While I certainly did not hate it, I would be lying if I said I was not disappointed with Spiderman.  But I guess every comic book film can not be as good as the original Batman.  Not much can.

Truly Unbelievable,"One can't really expect too much in the way of enlightenment from a comic book adaptation but even by those standards 'Spiderman' has a dreadfully hokey script rife with cliché and unexplained coincidence. Lest we forget, suspension of disbelief applies even here.A number of the performances are just plain corny (Cliff Robertson certainly milks his small role as Peter Parker's uncle) but Willem Dafoe's theatrically hammy performance does entertain in an Olivier-like fashion.The film has most to offer in its beginning section which features a number of spectacular special effects during our insight into the origins of the hero's super-powers.

Brutalitiy as a golden line of the old comic movie era,"The film that marked the beginning of the superhero genre in big cinema. Raimi, a man who had not made anything but horror to this point, was able, with his own unique style, love for the character and read in comics, to deliver such a powerful and brutal film with such cool characters that hardly anyone can compare with at all.The green goblin is a unique character, thanks to the performance of an unforgettable actor, William Defoe, who completely loves his character, the antagonist, who reads monologues to the hero about the cynicism of this world, and all this in the first film about the hero is just a bomb.

A mostly successful throwback,"At first it looks as though the title sequence lets us know what we're in for: the kind of hyperkinetic visual display you'd expect from a fourteen-year-old boy who'd just been handed a cheap (but nonetheless overpriced) computer animation program and who was determined to use every misbegotten one of its features at once. I thought I was watching the end result of an arms race in which studios vied to combine maximum glossiness with minimum creativity.Not at all, as it turns out. ""Spider-Man"" is the kind of fantasy we haven't seen since the 1980s: sweet, sincere, straightforward, and thrilling  or at least, if and when it fails to be thrilling, it at least makes an honest attempt.The movie works even though Raimi gets more wrong than he gets right. The main problem is that there's little real zing. But in addition: the dialogue is often awful, too many characters (the aunt in particular) are under-written, under-described clichés, and the montage Raimi throws at us as Peter Parker comes up with his spider suit design is just too goofy for words. What's more, when we get within fifteen minutes of the end it becomes clear that everyone stopped paying attention to the movie they were making and started thinking about the money to be made from a sequel. I won't say what happens Okay, I WILL say what happens, so stop reading if you must. Peter gives up Mary Jane  fails to tell her identity even though the entire narrative is structured around, is crying out for the moment in which she finds out - for no better reason than to facilitate a sequel. (Thus the most likable character in the film, on whom so much time had been spent, is given nothing to do, no real role to play in the story.) The misunderstanding over the identity of Norman Osborn's killer has been crudely pasted into the film for much the same reason. Is there any reason why Harry had to happen to see Spider-Man standing over his father's body, and then jump to an obviously wrong conclusion? None whatever, but it DOES provide him with a sudden overpowering ""motivation"" which will, alas, result in all manner of tedious plot complications in the sequel, perhaps even  who knows?  the sequel's sequel.The final image, by the way, is every bit as bad as the opening ones. It just goes to show that nobody has ever made a movie better by including a shot of the American flag, in any context whatever.But don't forget what I said earlier, about this being a sweet, sincere, simple  and for the most part competent  fantasy. Kirsten Dunst is charming.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Real Swinger,"Raimi, more than any other director, has almost perfectly captured the style and grace of Spider Man, especially when he swings around on his web going from building to building.  He also does a great job of capturing his grace of motion while doing gymnastics and fighting--but that is about it!  He does almost nothing to capture the youth angst that the original SpiderMan conveyed in the comic books.This may mostly be because the three main characters just seem to be phoning in the lines.  After seeing Jonah Jameson, I prayed for the time when he would be back on screen (this character was captured perfectly!).  Hopefully in future installments, the movie will take place more at the Bugle and we can see more of him.  I hope Aunt May doesn't die soon, as she also did a fairly competent job of capturing the sweetness of the comic book character.Except for the web slinging and Kirsten Dunst in her occasional short skirts, there is not much else here.

Patriotism was in the air and as well as this movie. Special effects where on everyone's minds. We where all about cliches and getting off the rough edge of the 90's.SETTING: Spiderman is set in an ideal time of when Baby Boomers were reading comics and we where enjoying the atomic family.

The special effects are mostly good but some are dated. There seems to be an emphasis on motion blur with many CGI models of Spidy swinging and flipping around.OVERALL

Doing the Things a Spider Can,"Sam Raimi takes a lighthearted approach to bringing everyone's favorite web slinger to the screen, and the result is a comic book movie that actually looks and feels like a comic book, and actually communicates some of the little-kid joy that makes comic book heroes fun in the first place.Tobey Maguire is hopelessly dopey and limited to one facial expression as an actor, but he's good enough for what this role requires. He's equaled in blandness by his love interest Kirsten Dunst.

A comment from an outsider,"I happen not to have a Ph.D. in comic book mythology.  I just watched Spiderman because my husband borrowed it from a friend.  I don't know webspinners from a hole in the ground.I was a little disappointed.  I didn't find anything offensive about the action or characters, but I turned off the set thinking, ""Yeah, so what?""  I guess it failed to dazzle.  I thought the Spiderman actor was a little young, but maybe he's supposed to be.  But why do they call him Spiderman, and not Spiderteenager?  His girlfriend looked much older, but maybe that was because her father knocks her around.I guess I'd give it a 5/10 and leave it at that.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Worth seeing once (if there's anyone out there that hasn't seen it already),"First off, I just have to say that nobody should tell you what a movie is supposed to be or meant to be. A corollary to that however, is that we all come into each movie with different expectations.Personally, I expected a huge blockbuster (which it was), while sticking to the quality I feel that Batman (1989) had. Unfortunately, I think the quality was lacking in several areas. First off, the acting was sub-par to me. My expectations, like all of you, get me into trouble here. I have always admired Dafoe's work, but he didn't seem at all comfortable in this role (and no, I really don't think I was typecasting him in my own mind). Toby was fine, but that's it. Dunst seemed to be overacting or something...I couldn't really tell. The script (dialogue) was bad period. Yeah, comic books usually are comprised of elementary dialogue but this was an insult even so. Obviously, you can't give the movie any credit for plot, twists, or cool self-referential themes since it's based on a prior work. The CGI was bad, see Attack of the Clones or LoTR for what they SHOULD have done with the computer graphics. The mood and tone throughout was decent, but Batman was better (credit Burton). The pace of the movie and the action, which is what I was so excited about, really didn't do it for me. Again, Attack of the Clones blew this movie out for pace and action. Okay, it's not fair to compare the two on that note, but I was expecting something more towards what I eventually saw in Attack of the Clones.It was worth seeing, but I won't be buying it and won't be seeing it again.

"Worth seeing, but not perfect","Well, I liked this one, but not as much as some other flicks I've seen. First of all, the main character, Peter Parker, is very believable as a nerd that isn't very well accepted by his fellow students, but gains super powers that he has to learn to handle and to use responsibly, which is of course not an easy task. I liked the other figures, too. What I didn't like that much, though, are some scenes that seem to be endlessly slow, which won't fit into the whole concept as a fast paced movie, but that is, of course, highly subjective.

Flawed. But still good.,"And by flaws I don't mean Organic Web-shooters. People who whine about that need a life ASAP! I didn't like 'Spider-Man' at first. I felt there wasn't enough good action and ariel battle scenes. And the Green Goblin's costume was just terrible. But at second glance, the acting was great. Tobey Maguire is the perfect Peter Parker, and had great chemestry with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst). And Willem Dafoe was also good. The beginning of the movie was very well done. Real faithful to the comic. But the scenes with MJ take away Spidey/Gobby action time. A bitter sweet trade I admit. Although these scenes had great emotion and depth and really defined the characters, I think they should have put equal amount of time and effort towards the action. Some of the action is laughable. The CG was pretty good though. But over all its a pretty good comic movie. But it could have been better. For an example of a perfect comic adaptation, look towards 'Daredevil'.RATING:*** out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Amazing Spiderman!!,"I was anxiously awaiting this movie. I expected high flying action, good fun, and a decent movie. What met me was three times that!! Sam Raimi blew me away with what is probably the best Super Hero film ever made. It wasn't dark, but it wasn't light-hearted, the phenomenal thing about this movie was that it was real. The world around Peter Parker and Spiderman was our world. Raimi did not ""Comic Book-ize"" the world like they did for Batman or Superman movies. It was our world, it was like looking right out our front windows.Tobey Maquire was the ideal choice for the run of the mill kid, who is picked on and misunderstood and pining for the beautiful popular girl. The popular girl is played by Kirsten Dunst who we know can look like a goddess or in this case, truly, actually look like the girl next door. Raimi is brilliant...this movie was filmed in what I call real-life. He took a fantasy about a kid bit by a spider and brought Spiderman into the real world. Maguire and Dunst both look like the average kid and I don't think a lot of make up was used to cover their imperfections and blemishes. Instead Raimi allowed them to look like human beings. The story for Spiderman follows true to the comics. Peter Parker, while on a school trip is bit by a genetically altered Spider and wakes up the next morning, stronger, faster, healthier, with enhanced...well everything. Immediately thinking of his own personal gain, Parker uses his powers to take on a wrestler and when he's cheated by the wrestling promoter he gets even by allowing a crook to rob the Promoter. Moments later Parker discovers that by letting that crook get away his beloved Uncle Ben (who is like Peter's father) is murdered by that crook. From that moment on Peter Parker vows to fight injustice with the words of Uncle Ben ringing in his ears...""with great power, comes great responsibility."" This movie spans the course of several years in Peter's life and Raimi covers that whole time without making us feel rushed or crammed together...instead it flows together, and leaves us riveted to the screen. Franco and Dafoe play Father and Son, and Dafoe during a experiment loses his mind and his personality is split into the Green Goblin who uses top secret Military technology to destroy the city. Dafoe is just brilliant as the evil Green Goblin and his alter ego, the suave Dr. Osbourn. Franco who plays Harry Osbourn, Peter Parker's best friend looks and acts so much like Dafoe that they are the most believable father and son in movies in years. The story is so depthy and full of emotion and action.The computer generated effects at times are almost cartoonish which I always HATE but Raimi uses enough effects mixed with live action that it flows well and you don't notice the computerized Spiderman nearly as much. Spiderman himself is also amazing as he should be. The costume and Maquire playing him make him the greatest hero on screen in years. This movie is so fantastic because it is so SIMPLISTIC!! It's like you're watching right down town Hometown. I honestly don't know if Raimi could pull off a sequel with the same quite subtlty and simplicity but I would love to see him try. I would pay the 10 bucks to not only see a sequel but I would even love to see Spiderman again. The running time was the better part of two hours and it was the perfect length. Everything about this movie was just enough of everything. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!! This is the great Blockbuster for the summer!!! 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spider Sense is Tingling,"A live action Spider-Man had been in the works for some time before comic-book fan and cult favourite Sam Raimi's film hit the big screen. The most notable was James Cameron's scriptment, whilst the likes of David Fincher and Tony Scott were considered for the job. Raimi got the gig, directing a film that works as both an origin story and as a fun action flick. It's clear that he has a love for the source material and that he understands the larger than life aspects of the comic world. What we get is good fun with some big limitations. The films heart is in the right place and it's full of emotion, yet the writing is frequently sloppy and it does descend into campiness a little too much.Story: Nerdy teenager Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider and develops spider-like abilities. He decides to use these powers to fight crime as Spider-Man once his uncle is killed. He is forced to confront businessman Norman Osborn whose evil alter ego is taking revenge on those who turned on him. The origin story is fairly simplistic, but I enjoy the messages it gets across. The 'great responsibility' stuff might be corny but it really works because the connection between Peter and his family feels genuine, whilst Peter developing and testing his new power is handled with care. Even though Peter's relationship with Mary Jane leads to some convolution I think it is handled well here. The Goblin plot is only where things go astray and that is mostly down to unclear writing.Hero: Tobey Maguire puts in a strong performance as Peter. What impresses is that he manages to capture the characters awkwardness whilst retaining an honest likability. His actions and motivations seem very natural. His Spider-Man isn't as witty or wisecracking as many want him to be, but I don't think that's much of an issue here.Villain: Willem Dafoe as Osborn proves to be extremely hit-and-miss. When Dafoe concentrates on the characters unease and the conflict within he is excellent, carrying a real sense of menace. The Goblin is just a hammy mess for the most part. Partly because the characters feelings and motivations are completely unfocused, partly because of some absolutely horrid dialogue and delivery.Support: Kirsten Dunst is good as M.J. She does have the girl next door vibe, while her motivations are clear and her relationship with Peter is built up with authenticity. I just don't like the way she is always a damsel and effectively becomes a plot device for Spider- Man to save. James Franco does a solid job as Peter's best friend and Norman's son Harry. Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson bring a welcomed sincerity to May and Ben. A real standout is J. K. Simmons as Jameson in what is some of the best casting ever seen. He nails the role by being a wonderful mixture of deadpan, sardonic and arrogant.Action: The action is certainly a mixed bag. While sequences like the wrestling match and the montage of Spider-Man's activity are great fun, the main pieces are a bit of a let-down. The parade fight is harmed by some woeful CGI which makes the city look like cardboard. The climax is a cool set-up, but lacks any real heft and it ends up being a bland punching match. That said, the scene in the flaming building is brilliant and features some really impressive effects.Music: Danny Elfman provides a surprisingly effective score. It's much bouncier and more bombastic than his usual work, fitting the film extremely well and giving a real sense of excitement to the images of Spider-Man swinging through the city. His main theme is also very memorable.Production: I find Sam Raimi's direction to be a lot of fun. He always appears to know what a scene needs to give it an extra spark and the camera follows suit in that respect. In a number of areas the CGI holds up well, but in many areas they are badly dated with some of the action scenes are affected by this. Even though Spider- Man swinging through New York looks great, there is a lack of weight to his movements that makes it obvious that CG was used. As far as the writing is concerned, all feel that the more humane aspects are expertly handled, but the superhero material suffers. There is a lot of emotion to be found in Peter's guilt and his connection with Mary Jane, yet his heroic antics do come across as clichéd and don't fit what the film appears to going for at all. The Green Goblin falls foul to a number of especially bad moments, the finish it scene and the ''Sleep..'' line are just cringe-worthy in the worst possible way.Conclusion: So while it is probable that Spider-Man was the first big modern superhero film and did start a tremendously successful trilogy, I simply think that it is a decent film, nothing more or less. It does offer a lot of entertainment and a heart which many superhero films lack, but it's susceptible to falling down when it looks like it will soar. In Sam Raimi you have an appealing director and yet I don't think he is fully able to do what he wished. What we get is a script that becomes too cluttered and a villain that is way too campy when the majority of the film isn't. With Maguire we have an easy to like lead adding to a very solid supporting cast and I do enjoy the relationships the characters have. In a way I wish there was more of that emotion. Instead we get a film that just about manages to balance heart over silliness.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Essential - electrifying action best MARVEL superhero origin story my second personal favorite Spider-Man superhero comic-book flick,"One of the most decent electrifying essential superhero's, the best origin story about a superhero Spider-Man - my personal favorite comic book superhero action movie. Spider-Man (2002) become a blockbuster hit in 2002 when it come out. Spider-Man is my favorite superhero. I known Spider-Man character superhero from animated TV series of the 90's. As a teeneger I saw music video Hero by Chad Kroeger featuring Josey Scott and I rushed to see this movie right away. A neighbor friend got me the movie on his comp and it was an adrenaline rush. This movie become my favorite superhero film of all time it still is. It defines my childhood. I watch this movie the first time as a teenager in a high school, it is a teenager dream.Spider-Man takes cues from Superman: The Movie (1978) which deals about superhero Clark Kent how he become Superman. Here is the origin story of how Peter Parker become from a shy nerdy teenager later photographer to a ultimate superhero of all time his alter ego Spider-Man. Just like Richard Donner directed the first Superman the excitement is here from MARVEL screenplay David Koepp created by Stan Lee R.I.P and Steve Ditko. I used to had VHS tape my mom bought me a present this movie, when I was a teen for my gradation day. I used too had the poster, but I don't know where that poster went too. I love this film to death my number 1 favorite Spider-Man film is Spider-Man: Homecoming but this Spider-Man the first in the trilogy is my second personal favorite Spidey film. I enjoy beautiful music score for Spider-Man from Danny Elfman, who also worked on a 1989 Batman music score. I love that music score to death.Directed was by Sam Raimi from ""The Evil Dead"" trilogy and stars: Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco.The first film has humor, fast pacing, a lot of action, good sci-fi effects beautiful cast, good likable leads and good FX special effects. I love the CGI effects and custom for Spider-Man and Green Goblin. I heard that thieves stole Spider-Man suits on the production set that the crew make them for this movie. Mostly I understand the character Peter Parker it has deep sense meaning to the character. The first half deals more about how Peter is learning about his super ability when he gets bit by a genetically engineered ""super spider"". First he wants to impressed his neighbor Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) the eternity love of his life by buying a car and he goes in to wrestling match to earn money. First half he was more selfish, shy and geek and he lost by a car jacking his uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and when he didn't safe that carjacker who killed his uncle he was selfish. But he got redemption later in the movie and he learns that is not what he does. Spider-Man saved more kids than The Amazing Spider-Man Andrew Garfield did. Spider-Man saves Marry Jane. He saves a baby from a burning building. Spider-Man saves a trolley car on the Roosevelt Bridge witch are kids in it. On a parade in which Green Goblin starts attacking Spider-Man saves a kid when a balloon is falling at him, almost crushing him.You have action sequences in which Green Goblin on jet glider fires on Spider-Man rockets, and bullets, slugs at him but misses. He throws pumpkin bombs on the Board of Directors killing them, he throws razor bats on Spider-Man and cuts him. I love the fight sequence between Spider-Man and Green Goblin I love that on the end.Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker / Spider-Man did a good excellent job playing his character. I like the actor he was excellent I really love his performance. Spider-Man was really the first film in the trilogy I saw. Kirsten Dunst was the best of the film as Mary Jane Watson. I love Kirsten she was my teen crush I loved her in Bring It On, The Crow: Salvation, Get Over It and The Virgin Suicides. I really, really miss the actress I grew up watching in Jumanji the actress, she was part of me growing up. James Franco as Harry Osborn was good I like the actor in a comedy Whatever It Takes he was good as Harry Osburn and a friend of Peter Parker. Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn is a kick-ass actor he plays so many good roles that I enjoy. I love him in Platoon as Sergeant Elias, White Sands and John Wick he played John Wick's friend Marcus. So I love the guy I love his portrayal.Some Spider-Man fanboy told me that Spider-Man was stalking Mary Jane, it wasn't true. He saw Mary Jane running on the dark streets alone and he saw a muggers following her, so he went after her to help her out and rescuing her, he wasn't stalking her. She was his crush but he wasn't stalking her.In my opinion it is a decent electrifying essential action film of one of the best origin story's of a superhero becoming a Spider-Man. But I am hug fan of Tom Holland's Spider-Man: Homecoming so this Spider-Man is my second personal favorite film in the ""Spider-Man"" franchise that come out of all five films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One word: Amazing,"Something inside of me still wishes that there will one day be a Spider-Man 4. This is the film that started it all, and tells a perfect faithful comic book adaption of Peter's origin story of what made him Spider-Man. I'm a huge sucker for an origin story and this film is pretty much a flawless example. This is how a superhero film SHOULD be made, this film means something to me and will always amaze me even if I were to view it for the 100th time. If I'm being honest, this movie is one of my all time favorites. The characters were perfectly brought to the big screen, the action still is refreshing and well executed, and lots of other reasons. I highly recommend this film if you haven't seen it, you won't be disappointed.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Great visual style but disappointing movie.,"The movie tries to be more than just a superhero movie. It tries to give the characters and the story more depth and emotions just like in Sam Raimi's other 'superhero' movie ""Darkman"", it didn't impressed me. At least ""Darkman"" still had some fun moments and characters. ""Spider-Man"" is a movie that looks great from the outside but is empty and shallow on the inside.There is nothing wrong with the casting in this movie. Tobey Maguire is a perfect nerdy Peter Parker and James Franco is equally good as Harry Osborn. The relation between Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson is nicely done thanks to the chemistry between Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst. Rosemary Harris and J.K. Simmons are also examples of some good casting.The villain however is disappointing. Willem Dafoe is a good actor but he is overacting too much in this movie. His shiny Green Goblin costume looks also very laughable, especially his mask that can't move at all, with as a result that he looks like a ""Power Ranger"" villain. Not only his mask looks ""Power Ranger"" like, also some of the action which I also found a disappointing aspect in the movie. The final showdown is also a disappointment and contains one very cheesy scene involving some New Yorkers on a bridge...Danny Elfman's music stands good on it's own but doesn't really fit the movie since there is no real 'superhero' theme like ""Batman"" or ""Superman"" had.Still ""Spider-Man"" is kind of a cool movie. Nothing beats seeing Spidey swinging through the streets of New York. The movie is still good as pure entertainment, a real popcorn flick if you like.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Truly depends on how you judge it.,"I'm not going to expend time and verbiage in attacking this film; I haven't the time or inclination. Yes, it is indeed poor in many respects, but I did enjoy it, unlike such ""blockbusters"" as ""Blade II"", ""The Fast and the Furious"" and ""The Mummy Returns"".Let me concede no vested interests here; I am no ""Spiderman"" fan of yore. Never read comics or seen the cartoon I don't think. It strangely eluded me really; maybe slightly before my time. I can, I feel, offer a fairly objective view here. Firstly, if anyone judges this movie by a yardstick of realism they would be very foolish. If they were to judge it by a measure of how good a film it is then they would be perhaps more understandably unwise. While I'm setting up the view that it must be viewed as a comic book interpretation, it should be said there have to be grounds for judging bad dialogue etc. on its own terms. An example would have to be the almost painfully two-dimensional and near comatose ""emotional scenes"" and particularly Kirsten Dunst's performance. There are comic book characters, and there are, well, very bad displays of acting. ""I'd like to learn how to act?"" I think she pallidly says at one point early on; well, the words seem apposite for Dunst herself. It is a swollen, perhaps thankless performance for an admittedly limited role. Maguire, well, very one-note and not all that impressive, especially as the film wears on. Willem Dafoe, and particularly J.K. Simmons as Jameson give far better ideas of how these sort of larger-than-life creations should be played... J.J. Jameson is an absurd, amusing character pitched at the right level; ""They gotta be giving names to these weirdos now!"" etc.It is often very difficult to tell whether the film is intentionally or unintentionally funny. The absurd haplessness of Parker's first Spider-Man costume is surely meant, as are certain touches of dialogue. A bizarre bit is where Dafoe, as Norman Osborne, launches a broadside against ""MJ"", or Mary Jane as she is belatedly known later on in the film. Something like ""you should do what you want with her and then broom her!"" I must say I laughed, as did my cohorts. Very odd wording and a plain absurd tone to it. Also, what was that Aunt of Parker's doing cropping up all over the place later on in the picture. She seemed to have insinuated herself into Mr Osborne's family. This isn't commented upon at any point. What was she doing frankly!? Dialogue like ""With great power comes great responsibility"" and Parker's beleaguered description of why he likes MJ really does make one laugh and not I suspect intentionally. And have I touched on the completely unnecessary and ludicrous advertising of having Macy Gray just tacked in there...? ;-) Oh, yes and the ludicrous, hackneyed scenes with Cliff Robertson's Uncle Ben and the ultimatum offered by the Green Goblin - ""The girl or the kiddies!!!!"" My word, the ""Green Goblin"", eh? Seemed a rum sort of villain, having little or no specified aims other than to be a madman, torment Spiderman and perhaps - but it is left very vague - get back at a few businessman...! What of the scene where the scantily-attired Dunst is ""accosted"" by these men doing weird dog impressions...?! Reminded me of a scene with Bobby Briggs in the ""Twin Peaks"" pilot episode... Very odd tone here, with a rape very much implied.Some moments perhaps jarred a little, with the cartoon violence - perhaps itself questionable if this is targeted at younger audiences - all too numbing. The change in a late scene to realistic bloody violence just doesn't feel right somehow; both depictions of violence here have their problems and jar with each other.While as you can see, I have much to question in this film, I must emphasize that I did enjoy the damn thing. It's better thought out and has more of a modicum of intelligence about it than the ""Blade II""s... Be wary of high expectations; this is hack work, and not always as well done as it could be, but it is at least fun to watch.Rating:- ***/*****",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"With great power comes great responsibility, Peter.","I love Spiderman along with millions of others, and I was just as thrilled when I first heard there was going to be a movie about my favourite web-crawler. Years later, after having watched it multiple times, I can honestly say this is a fantastic movie worth watching.Spider-Man is such a well-put-together film, despite the many forks and loops in the comic universe from where the source material comes from. Sam Raimi expertly covers an ample amount of Peter's life, his origin and paints an emotional picture of an average kid who's life begins to change. The computer graphics still hold up very well and the thrill of Peter putting on the suit and swinging from building to building is always as exciting as the first time watching. Additionally, Raimi made a smart choice to use the Green Goblin as the antagonist - using Osborn to weave Peter's personal and superhero lives together was Raimi's trick in proving that a comic book movie can be just as heartbreaking as a drama. And of course, I can't forget Danny Elfman's fantastic score, the theme something we all still hum every now and then to ourselves.I loved Raimi's take on Spiderman and loved Tobey Maguire's portrayal of the web-slinger, and now that we've gotten to see three versions of Peter's origin and life, I can genuinely say Raimi hit the nail on the head perfectly. Is this the best Spiderman movie? Not quite - but it's a part of the best trilogy for certain.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Definitely a fun movie.  Not necessarily a good movie though.,"This movie was amazingly fun to watch and had a lot of good laughs and great action scenes.  But, as much as I enjoyed the movie, there were some aspects that really bugged me.  The worst of which was the clunky dialouge (the hospital scene in particular).  If you were one of the thousands that were annoyed by Star Wars: Episode I's dialouge, then you will most likely have the same problems with the dialouge that I had.  If you don't understand why I don't like the dialouge in either movie, then consider yourself lucky not to have noticed.My other main problem was that some of the effects looked like I could have done a better job using photoshop on a Mac.  The scenes in particular that i am speaking of are the scenes in which Peter Parker is jumping from building to building in his plain clothes (near the begining) and the scene at the end with MJ hanging on the cable and getting tossed around like a rag doll after the Green Goblin makes his pass.Both of these scenes, along with the clunky dialouge, took me out of the fantasy world that was created around me and reminded me that I was just watching a movie.All in all, the rest of the film is done very well, and there are wonderful performances by Tobey MacGuire, Kirsten Dunst (I normally have really big problems with her performances, but this time she outdid herself), and Willem DaFoe.  Another notable performance was J.K. Simmons, who plays teh part of J. Jonah Jameson perfectly, and I must say that I really enjoyed his scenes.I would suggest going to see this movie to anyone that wants to be entertained and have a good time, but still don't think it's going to win any awards.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The best superhero movie since Batman.,"This movie was incredibly hyped up, then put off for some time due to some sensitive material, to be hyped up again. This movie didn't let me down.Tobey Maguire fit the part very well. He just had the look. I am in love with Kirsten Dunst, so there was no doubt in my mind that she was going to do great. Willem Defoe even made Speed 2 exciting, so again, there were no doubts.Danny Elfman may have ripped himself off for the soundtrack, but it still wasn't bad.Spider-man is one of our most recent classics. 10/10.

The origin of the most profitable franchise in history.,"This was the movie that I watched the most as a kid. Still holds up today with a fantastic origin story and Shakespearean drama. I'm sure that this is the best Spider-Man we will ever see because Raimi is the perfect director for this source material.With his low budget background, Raimi knew how to make a great looking movie for pennies. Given millions of dollars, Raimi gave us a very modern looking move even for 2018. Sure, the fight during the parade and a couple other shots are sort of bad looking due to 2002 CGI, but you can look past it because they are few and far between. Attack of the Clones came out the same year and it's incredible how much this holds up compared to it.People complain about the actors not being actual teenagers, but it's something I've never really been bothered with. Tobey is the perfect Spider-Man, portraying every side of Peter Parker to a T. Dunst is alright as a damsel in distress, but nothing to write home about. Dafoe was unhinged as the goblin, and it makes me really wish that they used the makeup that they were originally planning on doing so we could see more of his performance. I like the mask in some scenes though, like when he puts Peter to sleep and talks to him on the rooftop. Showing just his eyes, he is so menacing in that scene to the point where it's sort of disturbing. Simmons plays a perfect Jameson and Franco is forgettable but not terrible.All in all, this film is a bonafide classic that's in the same vein as the first superman in the 70s and 1989s batman. To me, Spider-Man is to my generation what those movies were to previous generations. All 3 represent something extremely fun and new. This, along with X-Men a couple years before, really brought comic book movies into the limelight again after they were dying down in the late 90s. This is a movie that I will be returning to for the rest of my life and one that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Sam Raimi Casts His Web And It Sticks Tight, Even After All These Years!","One of the first movies to pave the groundwork for modern superhero flicks, Spider-Man is an incredibly fun & endlessly entertaining action-adventure that brings its web-slinging hero to life on the silver screen in a truly fascinating manner after spending nearly a quarter of a century in development hell and, with its record-breaking box office performance, acts as a precursor to an era when superheroes would dominate the summer box-office.Based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, the story of Spider-Man follows Peter Parker; a high-school kid who after being bitten by a radioactive spider at a genetic laboratory begins to develop spider-like abilities and puts his new powers to good use by turning to crimefighting. Meanwhile, Norman Osborn experiments a power-enhancing drug on himself as a desperate attempt to preserve a military contract critical for his company's survival.Directed by Sam Raimi, Spider-Man has all the ingredients of a summer blockbuster plus it benefits a lot from Raimi's dynamic filmmaking style that doesn't dwell on a single moment for far too long, keeps the story fresh, light-hearted & action-packed for the most part, plus never loses its initially-gained momentum. David Koepp's screenplay is no slouch either for it packs in a compelling plot & few interesting characters and the whole story is splendidly humoured.The technical aspects are all brilliantly executed. Camera-work is excellent for the most part for the chosen angles, swift movements, slow-mo shots & warm colour palette are correctly employed. Editing provides a frenetic pace to its narrative, each moment has a role to play, and its 121 minutes of runtime simply flies by. Visual effects team makes use of both CGI & practical stuntwork and it's amazing just how well it has dated when compared to other effects-laden movies released back then.Coming to the performances, Spider-Man packs in a very interesting cast in Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Willem Dafoe, J.K. Simmons & others, and many of them are pretty convincing in their given roles. Maguire does a terrific job under Raimi's supervision, Dafoe plays Norman Osborn with finesse but that Green Goblin suit is extremely off-putting, Simmons is a near-perfect rendition of J. Jonah Jameson from the comics while both Dunst & Franco do a fine job as Mary Jane Watson & Harry Osborn, respectively.Also worthy of admiration is Danny Elfman's outstanding score that captures just the right tone & feel of your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man's universe and brims with tracks that seamlessly integrate into the story. On an overall scale, Spider-Man may not seem as impressive today as it did back when it made its debut on the silver screen but it still remains one of the best offerings of its category and delivers a roller-coasted ride that's enjoyable, entertaining & highly satisfying. Far better than its decade later reboot, Spider-Man is summer popcorn extravaganza right on the money.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A disappointing success??,"I have to say that the marketing of this movie was successful, frighteningly successful.  The movie itself, however, was disappointing.The graphics in the film were spectacular, and the effects were, to be honest, quite amazing.  They effectively pulled the comic from the pages of a book and put it in a feature film.The disappointing aspect of the movie, though, is the dialogue.  Granted, Peter Parker is a bit of a geek, and the Green Goblin is insane, but the dialogue for these characters is way over the top.  They've exaggerated the stereotype, and I'm not quite sure if it works for this type of movie! You can't really compare it to Batman, even if that would be your first inclination - they are hardly related.  The darkness of the Batman movies is a stark contrast to the light-heartedness of Spider-Man.It is my opinion that the movie would be unstoppable, if the characters had each stopped talking a few minutes earlier.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

pleasantly surprised,"having been an avid spider-man reader in my younger days, i was looking forward to the theatrical adaptation ever since i heard it was in the making. i wasnt expecting much, i did not want to get my hopes up too high only to be let down. when i heard toby maguire was to play spidey i was apprehensive, i liked the idea of him as peter parker, but spider-man? when i heard kirsten dunst was to play mary jane watson i cursed from anger over what i thought was a bad casting decision. having seen the movie as earliest as i could i can honestly say i was wrong, and the movie was very entertaining. maguire was perfect as both teenage peter parker and wisecracking spider-man. and dunst was surprisingly good as mary jane (i just couldnt see it in the trailers). the plot is admittedly simple and not in depth in the least, but thats okay, as long as the movie is strong enough in other areas, and it is. character development is fairly strong throughout, especially with peter parker and mary jane. alot of emotions are expressed and dealt with, its not all flash and glitter. norman osborne (aka green goblin) isnt developed as much as one would hope, but he plays it very well, especially in scenes where hes losing his sanity. i had issues about the revamped metallic green goblin suit, i just didnt like it before, and im not crazy about it now, but that can be overlooked in the long run. the supporting cast was pretty goood, especially j jonah jameson, he nailed down the comic book spirit. the special effects are mostly well done. some scenes had me bubbling with excitement over how exact spider-mans moves matched the classic comic book poses. i loved the touches. at times the effects looked like digital effects, but what do you expect? this is not a movie to critique on believability (is that a word?). is this a perfect movie? nope, but for what it is, its very well made with nice touches of humanity added to the characters. and thats refreshing in this genre of film. is this an entertaining movie befitting the web slinger we all love?

Spider-Man,"Before watching Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021), I decided to re watch all the previous Spider-Man movies. However, I wanted to wait to review all the Spider-Man's until after I saw No Way Home so I could get a true rating. Every single Spider-Man movie was amazing, but this one was actually closer to the bottom. Don't get me wrong, this was an amazing movie. It was the original Spider-Man, the one that started it all, and was one of the movies that helped the super hero genre become popular. It was also the first super hero movie I ever watched. The first time I saw it, I was around 7 years old. My dad recommended it as a family movie night choice, and I loved it. I wanted to watch it over and over again. This is the movie I credit with starting my love for super hero movies.All aspects of the movie were also great. I thought they showed the origin story of Peter Parker very well with the spider bite, to his transformation, and the killing of uncle Ben. They just did a great job. I also liked how they decided on a very well known villain to start. Norman Osborn as the Green Goblin was the perfect story. I love him as a villain and I feel it played very well with the story. The transformation into the Green Goblin was also well done.The acting and casting decisions were also perfect. Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker was great, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco were great as MJ and Harry, uncle Ben and aunt May were portrayed great, J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson was hilarious, and Willem Dafoe was unbelievable. I honestly believe he is one of the best super hero movie villains of all time. He was great.Lastly, I couldn't believe how good the graphics and effects were for 2002. They were great. I definitely recommend watching this movie. It was very well done, and it you are going to see No Way Home, watch all the Spider-Man movies if you have time. Trust me, I am glad I did.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not overly impressed.,I wasn't particularly impressed with this film. I felt it was too hyped up by he media and it failed to live up to all expectations.

They say there's a hero to save us and its definitely not Spiderman!!!,"This movie is without a doubt the most depressing experience I've had in the last year of movie going.  If I wanted to watch a cartoon, I would watch pokemon. At least it isn't as happy, fluffy, and corny as this movie.  I can't believe I waited years for these 2 hours of agony.  I would rather go suffer through a Disney sequel!! I loved Spiderman as a kid and found nothing but disappointment in this movie.  It's a shame, too, because this movie had all the right pieces to make a great movie but they made it look corny instead of cool.  I swear Spiderman's weightless or else he wouldn't be able to jump like this.  Why couldn't they just have made it look like he had weight?? I will give it some credit though.  Tobey Maguire did do a good job in his role.  Kirsten Dunst and the supporting cast did their part. However the green goblin was pathetic compared to Gene Hackman, or Jack Nicholson.  The musical score was great. I say this movie is happy, and fluffy, because no one dies, all the people are nice, and it doesn't show how the real world is.  I've got nothing against New York, but I know it's not that cheery. Overall this movie just comes up short of the quality that Superman or Batman attained.  I feel bad about this because spideys alwaysbeen my favorite.  Hopefully Daredevil or the Hulk will give Marvel its well deserved recognition. Until then DC comic's heroes are superior in Hollywood.   But for now all we have this horrible movie with an ending only `Planet of the Apes' can boast at being worse.

Entertaining - mostly; cringe-worthy - occassionally; but never brilliant,"This film was quite enjoyable but some of the 'romantic' scenes were bordering on execrable. I struggled to understand why more viewers weren't vomitting at these nauseatingly puerile teen wannabes. Dunst's character was far from the classic hero's love-interest. She was closer to the town bicycle, stumbling from one partner to another at a pace that would make the 'Sex and the City' girls cringe. The action, what there was of it, was entertainly and slickly rendered (for the most part) but was really all too predictable and the obvious sequel ending avaricious in the extreme. All in all I struggle to understand how this film can be running at the vote that it currently is - except that it is a sad indictment on the movie-makers and watchers!

A Great Comic Book Film,"With Spider-Man: No Way Home set to come to cinemas in a couple of weeks and the reveal that characters from previous Spider-Man films will be a part of it, I thought I should go back and watch previous Spider-Man films and here is my review for the first Spider-Man film.Main Character
Tobey Maguire plays Peter Parker/Spider-Man here and he just fits the role really well and is really fun to watch. You see him grow from this really uncomfortable nervous nerd to this confident super hero and it is executed really well. Maguire, brings emotion and humour to the role to really create this interesting and sympathetic hero that you can really care about.Supporting Characters
Willem Dafoe plays Norman Osbourne/Green Goblin and he was literally born to play this role. He nails the duplicity of the role and the insanity that comes across from the Goblin, the costume isn't great but he is a very memorable villain for sure. Kirsten Dunst plays MJ and she does her job to the best of her abilities. The character isn't written very well and is basically a damsel in distress but I thought she had good chemistry with Maguire and it just about worked in this film. Similar with James Franco as Harry Osbourne, he isn't given that much to do but he is decent when on screen despite some of the plotting for the character not being that great in this film. Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris are both very good as Uncle Ben and Aunt May and you see the impact they have on Peter's life and how it moulds him as a superhero. Onto the show stealer which is JK Simmons as J Jonah Jameson, when people ask what is the greatest casting in a comic book film he is the answer I give. He hasn't got a huge role in the film but when he is on screen he knocks it out of the park and is literally the only person who could ever play this role in live action.Story
The story is good, I think it is a really effective origin story for Spider-Man and really gets us invested in the character and moves at a quick enough pace that it never feels dull or slow. But this film does suffer a bit in their handling of some of the subplots, like the whole romance story. The characters of MJ and Harry are really underdeveloped and made to come across as bad people which doesn't make sense when the performers are really trying their best.Script
The script is effective, it is funny at times and the drama mostly works. You care about the main conflict and Spider-Man which is the most important part of the film. But there is no denying that some of the writing is incredibly cheesy and feels dated, making me cringe. Plus as I said some of the story elements just don't work.Style
The style of the film still holds up. The action scenes are very exciting and cinematic, I may have complained about the Goblin costume but the Spider-Man costume is amazing and so iconic. The film is paced really well and kept me interested and enjoyed throughout.Overall
Overall, Spider-Man is a great film. It is one of the superhero films that started the craze of these type of films and it still holds up really well.Rating - 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Big-budget blockbuster film-making with flair; a blast from start to finish.,"Sure, at times 'Spider-Man (2002)' is a little cheesy and perhaps even border-line camp, but this is big-budget blockbuster film-making with flair. Sam Raimi's distinct directing style is present and appreciated, even if it is reined in a little. It brings to life a colourful comic-book world in a believable, entertaining way and it's much better than the washed-out, generic stuff we so often see nowadays. The piece can be melodramatic on occasion but it also isn't afraid to get dark, with some sequences actually being pretty brutal (I'll refer you to the final fight between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin, whose defeat is wince-inducing to say the least) and highlighting the dangers of the occupation well, while never losing sight of the heart of the character. The flick is incredibly well-made and, for me, still holds up. It's a true highlight of the genre; a blast from start to finish. 9/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pretty good,"Spider-Man was an enjoyable light summer move, and was pretty good all around ... the acting was pretty good.. the effects were pretty good.. the story was pretty good.

Over-rated,"Being hearing impaired, I ahd to pick up the DVD version of Spider-Man (2002) in order to get my first viewing of the film.  I was a comic-book geek in the early 1990's, I was a film-fan that followed the legal battles to get ""Spider-Man"" made on the big screen.  I lobbied for people to give Tobey Maguire a chance as Peter Parker because I was a fan of his and I thought he deserved a shot at showing Peter Parker in his full splendor....That being said, this film pained me to watch it.When watching comic book adaptations, one lists Superman, Batman and X-Men as some of the quality cinematic versions of the Comic genre...  Superman put the Man-of-steel into reality, Batman took us the comic book with it's overall production, and X-men mocked itself in order to give a realistic twist to the fantasy.    Spider-man does a good job of staying true to some origins and has scenes that are very campy and make you feel like it's a cinematic version of a Comic Book.  There are too man flaws in the film however -- the painful-to-watch Kristen Dunst as Mary Jane Watson and her carpet-bagging with boys (oh yes, she is beautiful, yes she is talented - but her smile looked painful and part of her performance I enjoyed most was the rain-soaked scene), Tobey as Peter Parker/Spiderman who I couldn't quite get behind and couldn't quite believe as the nebish and socially inept Parker, and the a-bit-too-CGI Spider-man shots (that were a necessity).With all this negativity, I need to give a nod to James Franco and Willem Dafoe for their portrayals of Harry and Norman Osborne (respectively). Those were characters I got behind....  The antagonist (Dafoe) and his not-quite-good-enough son (Franco).  It's very disenchanting when you can get behind the villian before the hero.Suffice it to say, I am very dissappointed in ""Spider-Man"" as a motion picture.  After nearly 20 years of studios feuding to get the right to make this movie, you would think that they would have done a better job with the script, with the characters and with the direction of the film.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

For me this is the original Spider Man film!!,"Spider-Man is a superhero film Directed by Sam Raimi. The film stars Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, J. K.

This film is a perfect combination of action, romance a bit of comedy emotions and sense of responsibility and Sam Raimi deserves an applause for this.The plot of the film is impressive and the execution is engaging. The film nowhere looses the connection from the viewers and the connection gets more and more gripping as the film progresses.The acting in the film is superb and for me Tobey Maguire has always been the best spider man. Willem Dafoe was remarkably impressive in the character of Green Goblin and it seems that the role was tailor made for him. Kirsten Dunst looked very pretty and James Franco was superb. J. K. Simmons provides the much necessary comic relief.Screenplay of the film is good and the VFX was very impressive and the film sets up a great foundation of a great series.For me this is the best superhero film which gives a nostalgic reminder.

As good as it gets; but is there enough for more?,"If you're a Spider-Man fan like me, then you doubtless enjoyed this respectful retelling of his beginnings; and more than any character in comics, HOW Spider-Man started is crucial to who he is.  A man who made a mistake as a boy, and will spend his life fruitlessly trying to atone.  I highly recommend this movie.This movie worked, but it had to use a lot of tricks to do so.  CGI is the least of it; I enjoyed the effects in the spirit they were presented: to me, they looked so unreal precisely because that is how Spider-Man would appear to move.  But the real problem is for a character to have emotional heft when you cannot see his face.  They solved that THIS time by having his mask shredded in the film's final battle, which was an excellent physical and emotional one.  But they can't do that twice without the artifice showing. Toby Maguire will need to convey things much better through his body language next time.  Maybe have a mime consult the next film, or a deaf person who has to rely much more heavily on posture for context.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
it's get better as time and viewings go on,"Sam Raimi to me didn't seem like not the wrong choice to direct Spiderman but the un-needed choice- at least at first. The screenplay would've fit any director whose a fan of Spiderman since it entails most of the clichés and knowledge that goes into a comic book adaptation. But after repeat viewings, and seeing Spider-Man 2 more as well, I've grown some more respect for a picture that I thought of at first as being as nothing more than something of Raimi going 'mega Hollywood' in telling the origin of Peter Parker. In this first installment, he fights the Green Goblin played by Willem Dafoe in a dual personality type role with Norman Osborne.Watching the movie, I liked the set up parts and the connection between Maguire and Dunst is there, but on the outset when I saw it early on I was not so much a fan of the action sequences, which compared to Raimi's grittier (and funnier to be sure) Evil Dead movies, are so fabricated they might as well have credited Pixar as one of the production companies. The work though shows a little better once settled further into the Parker saga, and the real skills come through better. And compared to others that have come out in more recent years, it is exciting in ways other action set pieces from other comic book movies aren't. I even dig the performances more too, especially Willem Dafoe as Osbourne/Green Goblin, who puts as much gnarly relish into his performance that it ranks up there with his best work. Maybe part of it too is accepting Maguire as Parker/Spiderman, as he has an awkwardness early on that's uncanny. But it fits, and it perhaps grows in the sequel(s), and seeing it again I appreciate what he's doing in the character.In short, it's fun, and that's all we can really ask for.

Caught in its web of entertainment.,"Fans of Spider-Man had been waiting for the webslinger to hit the big screen since 1985 when Cannon Films (the people responsible for MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE and SUPERMAN IV:  THE QUEST FOR PEACE) had the movie rights tot he character.  Then it looked as if 21ST Century Films (who gave us that truly awful adaptation of CAPTAIN AMERICA (1990) would make the movie.  Now, after all of the legal battles have been settled, SPIDER-MAN has finally hit the movies.  I'll confess, I'm more of a DC Comics fan, Batman in particular. But, hey, any film based off of a comic book superhero can only be a good thing, right?  And SPIDER-MAN IS a good thing. Even the most casual comic fan will know the story:  young Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is an orphaned high school student who is pushed around by practically everyone.  For years, he has had a crush on Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), the girl next door.  One day, on a school field trip, Parker is bitten by a genetically-altered (as opposed to radiation like in the comics) spider.  As a result, he begins to go through some SERIOUS changes:  His eyesight is improved where he no longer needs glasses, his physique is now buffed beyond belief, he has phenomenal strength and agility and can stick to walls and ceilings.  But there is the most important change:  he now can shoot webs from his wrists (unlike the mechanical webshooters from the comics).  I suppose they had to make the webbing come from his arms as opposed to where a spider's web REALLY comes from (let's just say it's why you see spiders hanging upside down when they dangle from the thread), it would be too embarrassing otherwise. At first, Parker tries to use his powers to become a pro wrestler (he squares off against none other than Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage), until those fateful events:  A robbery that Parker could have stopped.  The escaped crook pulls a carjacking, of whom the victim happens to be his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), who had earlier tried to tell Peter ""With great power also comes great responsibility"".  When Peter realizes that the man who killed his uncle is the same one he could have stopped earlier, that is when he decides to become a superhero.  Sam Raimi directs with an understated flair that isn't quite as over-the-top as his style on the EVIL DEAD movies, but you will still have a good time. The villainy of SPIDER-MAN is provided by businessman Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) who, after experimenting with equipment that was supposed to go to the military, goes insane and ends up becoming the Green Goblin. Dafoe's laugh rivals that of Jack Nicholson's Joker in BATMAN.  In fact, there are some scenes here that will remind you of Tim Burton's 1989 blockbuster (The parade with balloons, the hero and villain fighting over the heroine in a dilapidated, abandoned building in darkness) as well as the 1978 SUPERMAN (Parker running down the street, ripping open his shirt to reveal his costume underneath), especially in the scenes set at the Daily Bugle, the newspaper run by the ever-cranky J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) that will recall Perry White and the Daily Planet in the earlier movie. Also on hand are Sam Raimi regulars Bruce Campbell (as the wrestling ring announcer) and his younger brother Tim (as one of Jameson's assistants).  Needless to say, the movie ends with the possibility of a sequel, which probably would have materialized even if the movie didn't become the hit that everyone is predicting that it will be.  After all, with the probable exceptions of Batman and the Flash, Spider-Man has the most interesting and recognizable rogue's gallery of any superhero.  From the multi-armed Doctor Octopus, the ever-shifting Sandman or Spider-Man's evil doppleganger Venom (and his ""offspring"" Carnage), there are no ending to sequel tales.  Of which I, like millions other, am looking forward to.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"A great movie, for a great comic.","I just wrote a LONG comment on spider man, and I lost it, so I'm making this one short. Spider-Man was excellent. I've been thinking they should make it for YEARS. It compliments the comic very nicely, without the darkness some other comic-to-movie films have had in the past(Batman sequels -I thought the first Batman with M. Keaton had the perfect dark tough of Gotham City, so I do like the darkness in Bman 1). Tobey Maguire, I had my doubts about as Spider Man at first, but now I realize it great for the role. As was everyone else(hats off to Willem Defoe, perfectly portryaying the ever creepy Green Goblin). Although sometimes the graphics were a bit corny, and at a few scenes, I got a Power Rangers feeling when they weren't using graphics in a scene between G-goblin and Spiderman, just looking at them in the cheesy suits looked like something out of Power Rangers. However, this happened noly around 2 times in the film, and it wasn't a biggy.

Superman for todays crowd,"Delivering nearly all the blockbuster potential it held, Spider-Man burst onto the public consciousness in 2002, surpassing even the most generous sales expectation to become one of modern cinemas highest grossing films. Basically a catalyst behind the never ending glut of comic book franchises today, the movie proved to be an extremely agreeable update of essentially the same qualities which made Superman just as endearing in the old days. Borrowing a little heavily from that prototype, as is the original Stan Lee based comic, lies the same geeky alter ego who works at a newspaper while pursuing crime and the girl he loves in secret. Nothing really strays too far from that quintessential superhero lore, but if anything, puts it all in one very entertaining and accessible package for all shapes and sizes to enjoy.Part of the winning strategy behind this success story was the smart idea of putting veteran gore hound Sam Raimi on the case. Raimi was a fixture with 80's cult horror, providing the wonderfully crazed Evil Dead series amongst other demented fare. Having graduated with flying colors from the clutches of low budget horror, Raimi went on to direct more standard Hollywood fare, but it was the great stroke of casting him as director of this franchise that really made him a household name to middle America. Whoever knew that Raimi would be the right man for the job must have known what they were doing, for there was hardly a hint he would be capable of sustaining this kid-friendly, adult-entertaining film while retaining the integrity of the original comic books which it's based upon, though after a few frames of this easy to swallow comic adventure it becomes clear he was ideal. Raimi walks a fine line between Marvel geekdom and general audience appeasement, crafting a balanced piece of work that should appeal to a surprisingly large and varied demographic.The action is intense but bloodless, conveying the painful struggles Spider-Man endures facing his enemies, but never making the violence mean spirited so a younger crowd may enjoy as well. The much touted CGI effects still retain a wondrous sense of physicality five years later, articulating the most romanticized superhero homage since the original man of steel whenever the camera takes flight with Peter Parker. Spidey himself could not have been better cast; Tobey Maguire silenced nearly all critics with his powerfully introverted but accessible performance, filling out plenty of shiny sequences with a greater sense of depth then the genre usually provides. J.K. Simmons offers some wonderfully crafted comic relief in a brief supporting role, but Willem Dafoe oversteps a cartoonish boundary when portraying murderous alter-ego Green Goblin.All in all, a triumphant accomplishment for this team, worthy of the big interest it initially received due to Raimi's winning approach. Spider-Man still suffers from many of your typical Hollywood clichés, especially if one still holds the fossilized Superman franchise in high regard, but there seems to be enough passion coming from nearly all involved to take the crown as current champ of superhero productions.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
On the level of epic storytelling,"Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire) is lonely, insecure, and is in love with Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst), a girl he has had a crush on since he was six. One day, while on a field trip to a laboratory where they are studying arachnids, Peter is bitten on the hand by a genetically altered spider that had accidentally gotten out of its cage. Peter goes home in a daze over what has just happened. The next day, he finds himself mysteriously buffed up and no longer needs to wear glasses. So off he goes to school to endure another day of torment by his peers. Just as he is about to start eating lunch, a weird feeling comes to Peter, just as Mary Jane is about to slip in a puddle. Peter catches Mary Jane and her lunch just in the nick of time. After he continues eating, Peter accidentally shoots a string of web from his wrist. While trying to hide the webbing, he accidentally pulls a lunch tray and it hits one of his tormentors in the back. Peter then hauls a** out of the cafeteria. The guy he hit in the back follows Peter, looking for a fight. Peter is able to miraculously overcome his opponent with the use of his new found ""spider-sense"". On the way home, he begins running and running and finally leaping from building to building and then spinning and spinning. Peter decides to keep his new abilities secret, but when a thief that he could have stopped kills his beloved Uncle Ben, he then decides that he is going to use his abilities to fight crime. It seems that his abilities could not have come at a better time, as he now has to square off against the mysterious and deadly Green Goblin/Norman Osborn(Willem Dafoe).""Spider-Man"" definitely is the movie to see this year. The hype surrounding this movie is unbelievable. When I went to see this movie yesterday, the theater was packed. Everybody cheered when Peter beat up that one guy and when he tracked down the man who killed his uncle. It seems to me that this movie affected everyone in the theater the same way. There is a very wide range of emotions to be experienced when watching this movie. Some of the emotions I'm talking about like happiness, loss, grief, and good triumphing over evil to name a few. Sam Raimi of ""The Evil Dead"" fame is the perfect director for this film. Some of the comic elements that he uses in some of his earlier films are highly present in this film. You should also be on the lookout for Raimi favorite Bruce Campbell in a small cameo as a ring announcer.This movie succeeds because of two key things: smart casting choices and epic storytelling. First off, Tobey Maguire IS Spider-Man! I must admit, that I followed some of my friends when they said that Tobey Maguire could not play Peter Parker. I found out yesterday that is not true. He is Peter Parker, he is Spider-Man. He owns that role. Much as Christopher Reeve played the part of Superman and Michael Keaton was Batman before him, Tobey Maguire will take his place in superhero history as Spider-Man. He is a very good actor in this movie. The scene where he visits Aunt May in the hospital or the ending scene in the cemetery where he talks to Mary Jane about their relationship all go to show how good he can act. Although I have not payed that much attention to Kirsten Dunst, I must admit that she was perfectly cast as Mary Jane Watson. She really has that girl-next-door kind of charisma that is required for a role like hers. Willem Dafoe easily plays one of the best comic book villains of all time as Green Goblin. He's basically torn by grief from loosing his company and from pursuing a life of crime as Green Goblin. The scene where he talks to the Green Goblin mask is one of his best scenes.The costumes for Spider-Man and Green Goblin are some of the most fantastic costume designs and make up effects I've seen since ""Dick Tracy"". This movie deserves to get an Oscar nomination for Best Costume Design and Best Make Up.The action sequences are some of the best I've ever seen for a superhero movie. The web-slinging scenes, whilst being computer animated, are extremely convincing, largely because they look so real. The scene at the party where Spider-Man and Green Goblin meet for the first time is probably the best action scene in the movie.""Spider-Man"" deserves all the praise that it is going to receive, no doubt. I love this movie. I really want to go see it again, but I know that I probably won't be able to. This movie will blow you away, it'll make you want to cheer and it'll make you want to cry.I give ""Spider-Man"" a big 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An almost perfect adaptation,"You cannot convince me that no one else makes a better Spider-Man than Tobey Maguire.As someone who was part of the 90s Spiderman hype, this film came out at the perfect time.

Not to mention the upside-down movie kiss that stays a Hollywood movie classic.They should have ended the series at Tobey's depiction of Spiderman, but I understand that people need to make money on their licensing contracts.5/5.

A classic spider-man film.,"Spider-Man is probably the most popular superhero as of writing this review even more popular than batman worldwide and what made this character so popular is probably this movie. I know Spider-Man was popular since the comics and blah blah blah but the impact this movie had on Spider-Man's character is what boosted his popularity worldwide.To start with the review I wanna say that I've seen this movie a long time ago and I don't remember every single detail about movie what I remember is the plot, what happens in the movie, how it ends, etc. You got my point right? So let's jump on to the review.This movie came out in 2002 and it definitely helped to boost the popularity of superhero films or genre in general because the movie was really good.The movie follows the life of a teenager named Peter Parker who is smart but very shy, has a crush on a girl from his class and tobey maguire did amazing job in acting department portraying peter parker. The cast of this film was really good, every character played their important role in the film but there's an exception and that's Mary Jane the girl on which peter has crush on and tbh I think throughout the whole trilogy MJ's character is just dumb and don't hold any major value factor and don't have any sort of impact of peter at all. Otherwise the whole cast was really good and everyone did amazing performance especially green goblin actor Willem Dafoe MAN THIS GUY IS JUST NUTS!!! I'm so pissed that he don't have any oscar yet like dude he's a terrific actor and the way he portrayed green goblin was just phenomenal. It's just like The Dark Knight where heath ledger (Joker) outshines Christian Bale (Bruce Wayne/Batman) this is what dafoe did in this film and even the guy who played harry also did very good job.Overall the movie is good as an introduction to Spider-Man's character and Sam Raimi and the cast did good job pulling it out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the best superhero films ever,"I enjoyed this. If you liked the first Superman film, you will love this. I think that it is better then Superman, but Superman is still good. If you are a fan of the spider-man comic books, then you will like this. I believe that any true fan of the comics would enjoy this film. I have read some Spidey comics and liked them. If you have not seen this, then go to your local video rental store and rent it. If you like it, then buy it. I remember the day I first saw it in the theater. I was 5. I loved it. So did my mom. We bought it on DVD when the DVD came out. I still love it to this day. I have seen all 3 in the movie theater and own all 3 of them on DVD. So my overall rating for Spider-Man 1 is 8 out of 10 spiders. Enjoy. Thank you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Green Goblin: ""What's my motivation?""","The first half of ""Spider-Man"" really is perfect. It's everything you could hope for in a comic book movie. It's lighthearted, yet dramatic, as well as exciting. It is the reason to go see it.The film also has problems that any this huge, with this much at stake, is likely to have. Some are merely inconsistencies with the comic, which I can't argue with. For one, Peter fires the webbing out of his wrists, which he never did in the comic. In the comic, he fits his costume with web-shooters that fire super strong webbing. But having the webs fire from his own wrists in the film creates some nice comic moments and is more economical, story-wise, than having manufactured web shooters. So this is easily excused.In true comic-book fashion, the hero and the villain are created nearly simultaneously, in completely unrelated events. I was able to shun this aside as well. That's just a Hollywood coincidence and is consistent with comic storytelling.Another aspect of the comic that the film misses is Spider-Man's sarcastic sense of humor. In the comic, in even the most dire situations, Spider-Man always found some wise-crack, which was sometimes just to hide his own fear. It's like trash talk, of the NBA variety. This is one of the most appealing and unique aspects about the Spider-Man character and the film barely touches on it.The film runs into real problems, though, with the Green Goblin (and I don't mean the problems he causes Spider-Man). Norman Osborn's mental breakdown, triggered by his business failings, is well represented by Willem Dafoe. The performance is great, but it doesn't look like he was allowed to have any fun, the way Jack Nicholson was as the Joker, Michelle Pfiefer as Cat Woman, and Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor. Even Ian McKellen as Magneto (in ""X-Men"") looked like he savored every moment of that role. But the Goblin of ""Spider-Man"" is just an extreme version of every character Dafoe's ever played (I had this flashback of ""Shadow of the Vampire"" when Osborn gasps upon seeing the blood on Peter's arm in the Thanksgiving scene). There's nothing surprising about the character, nor any moments that let you know the film isn't taking itself too seriously. A film like this needs to show that it is aware of its own triviality, something usually done through the villain. Sam Raimi doesn't get this.That isn't even the film's biggest flaw. This flaw could have been fixed with one or two small changes and would have made a huge difference. The Goblin's motivation for wanting to kill Spider Man-what is it? The film never gives a convincing one. Even a comic book movie needs this. For some reason, writer David Koepp has the Goblin decide that Spider-Man can't be beat (he's ""virtually invincible""), so he asks the hero to join him to do what, exactly? When Spider-Man refuses, the Goblin gets angry and tries to kill him. He goes after his family and friends just to bait him. This concept is just, well, dumb. For one thing, the whole appeal of the Spider-Man character as a superhero is that he IS vulnerable. He does have superhuman strength, but bullets can hurt him. He can be killed by things that would kill normal people, like bullets and fire. All he has going for him is his spider-sense, his strength, his agility.Another point: this vendetta of the Goblin's isn't even consistent with the Norman Osborn character Koepp had built up to that point. Osborn is a guy who blames other people, homicidally, for his own failings. He doesn't get the DOD contract and kills the men who said no to him. Spider-Man saying no didn't make any difference one way or the other. It didn't cause any failing on Osborn's part. Now, if Spider-Man had caused the Goblin to fail in some way, or stood in his way and created the perception that it was Spider-Man's fault, well, that would have been a different story. As it is, though, this lack of motivation leaves a huge hole through the middle of the movie. At least for me.Grade: B-",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The only true spiderman?,Hey... This is a classic. The spiderman movies they make these days are a joke. They make so many superhero movies these days that you hate the idea of a superhero movie. I just remembered that I used to love them because of these classics. The original spiderman is a good movie with a beautiful message. I miss the Good old days...When they didn't make movies just for the money. They made movies because they had this great idea in their mind and wanted to share it with the world.

The CGI crowd did their job, I just wish the writers had done half as well. My husband is really into sound and said it was good. (I thought so too, but one ear doesn't really work.) The movie started so slowly, we were wondering whether we should give up on it about 20 minutes in. We only give up on about one movie in twenty, so that tells you something.

"A major return to form for Sam Raimi after the disappointing ""the Gift"" (2000)","Adaptations of comics for the screen have become one of Hollywood's main specialties. So far, most of super-heroes for their transition to the screen were entitled to a reliable film-maker and not to a director of musical video clips. Thus, Tim Burton shot ""Batman"" in 1989 while Bryan Singer amazed with his movie ""X-Men"" (2000). Here, it is Sam Raimi who decided to adapt the adventures of Spider-Man; a plan he surely undertook with joy. Indeed, this iconoclastic film-maker is an avid fan of the comic strip. So, he seemed to be cut out more than anyone else for the film. A surprise: his work doesn't disappoint and maintains itself high above the expectations and is incredibly exhilarating. The movie has been a (largely deserved) triumphant success and for Sam Raimi it was his long-awaited commercial breakthrough. Maybe it wasn't such a bad thing for him to have moved in the Hollywood mainstream.Why is ""Spider-Man"" so successful? Simply because Raimi hired a winning team at all levels. First, Raimi's making reflects the enthusiasm he felt to shot his movie. Full of energy, liveliness, it doesn't leave a minute's rest to the spectator. We are carried away by the adventures of Peter Parker/Spider-Man with a lot of frenzy and happiness. It is useful to note down that at the end of the projection, you feel so happy that you ask for more! To come back to Raimi's making, there's a perfect marriage between impressive action sequences and the interesting psychological portrait Raimi makes of his main character. On another hand, the indispensable amounts of humor and emotion haven't been forgotten.Congratulations to the scriptwriter David Koepp. Why didn't he get an Oscar for his work? He has written a watertight screenplay which is flawless. It does everything to remain faithful to the original comic strip. More important, Koepp conceived his script, mainly as a kind of apprenticeship. Peter Parker will test the extent of his powers (first against one of his rivals in his high school, then during a wrestling fight) before putting his red and blue suit on and facing violence in New York and eventually the Green Buffoon (Im not sure if it's the right name).A brilliant screenplay wouldn't be anything without a suitable cast. It is of an impeccable quality. Thanks to ""Spider-Man"" Tobey McGuire probably finds the role of his life. At last a role at the extent of his talent. Beside him, Kirsten Dunst has such an appealing charm that it is difficult to resist her. Willem Dafoe is just amazing in his role of wicked. As for JK Simmons, he may have a short role but each of his apparitions is a delight so much that he nearly steals the show to the other actors.But special effects aren't always subtle or sometimes a little too intrusive and David Koepp has forgotten to remove a few clichés about his main character, notably at the beginning of the film. But fortunately, they are tiny details and if we ignore them, ""Spider-Man"" appears as a blockbuster whose homogeneity is impressive. It satisfies both the fans of the comic strip but also movie lovers. Raimi's masterpiece lasts about two hours. Not a minute is too much in it. You can't refuse such an exciting show like this one. The second part of the adventures of Spider-Man was launched in the summer 2004 with the same crew and was equally successful as the first one. As we say: we don't change a winning team.Well done Mr Raimi!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Good adaptation of the comic book.,"This movie had a lot of fun and laughs in the beginning when Peter Parker, being the adolescent nerd tries to fit in with the rest of the kids in school.  Along with the discovery of his power and the not so direct path in learning how to use it, physically and mentally.   Including some immature attempt to make some money in order to buy a car so he could please Mary Jane.The Development of the characters, including Peter Parker, from an innocent kid to this superhero was very well done.  As for the Green Goblin, he was portrayed well as this troubled scientist who had an alter-ego.  Too bad his costume masked his whole face, since pretty much all of his devious characterizations were portrayed through a mask that didn't animate.  We did get to see a little of the eyes later on though when he keep the mirrored googles in its opened position.  Jamson's character was the most colorful, it is as he is lifted straight out of the comic book.The swinging sequences were quite unique, giving us a perspective from spidey himself.  The only scenery that has a grand portrayal is on the Queensborough Bridge.  I guess this movie didn't really aim for that.Much of the scenes seemed way too dark, where it looks like it was filmed in a dark place, with dim lighting so the central action is not high lighted.  And if that was not enough, most were fast paced action.  What one ends up seeing is a whole bunch of dark blotches and blurs, making us have to guess what those scenes were about.A scene I found too sappy is the one where Spider Man takes Mary Jane for a ride down the city via his spider webs.  Seems to be straight out of Superman during Loise Lane's first flight with superman.To sum it up, an enjoyable superhero movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good...except for Maguire,"You probably know the story, so I'll skip a synopsis.The movie was fun--it moved quickly and had great special effects. I was almost always interested...but there are two big problems with this film:1) Tobey Maguire--a horrible choice for Spider-Man. He's a good actor but he's so quiet and laid-back. Peter Parker/Spider-Man should be played by somebody with a lot of energy and more of a screen presence. I didn't believe him for one second.2) The final battle between Spidey and the Green Goblin--WAY too violent for a PG-13 movie. I was disturbed by it--there was no need to get so graphic.However, I liked everything else. Kristen Dunst was pretty good as Mary Jane Watson and Willem Dafoe (as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin) and drop-dead handsome James Franco (as Harry Osborn) are excellent in their roles. There's a LOUD pounding score too and some excellent special effects (which work better on a big screen than on TV).Basically a good summer movie--if only they had cut down the violence and replaced Maguire.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Such delightful tosh, but wonderful? No!","What is the hype all about?  Because millions of $$ have been spent to make the film?  Where did all those millions go?  Honestly, this is neither original nor exciting, as fantasy or sf.  We have been there before and in worthier company: Superman I and II, Batman, and even Flash Gordon (1980). But the commercial success of the film, not only in the States but also in Europe, testifies to the publicity mechanism of Hollywood; it is not available to poorer companies or countries.The film has acted as an uncouth catalyst in Britain where the trend is towards a neo Victorianism in morals. Some local authorities refused a license to screen it! Unbelievable in 2002. There is more realistic violence in half an hour in any of the dozens of serials on tv screens than in the whole two hours of Spiderman.  In France, I watched one afternoon in this holiday season, in a provincial cinema packed with children(with their parents, I ought to add) who never stopped giggling throughout.That's what it is!

Good storytelling.,"This is primarily a response to Mr. Bunch's opinion.  As both a long time comic book fan as well as movie buff, I have to say I am tired of people that exalt style over substance.  Batman does not even come close to this movie.  In general, while Burton's films look good, they are primarily all style and no substance (with a couple exceptions such as Ed Wood and the Nightmare Before Chistmas).This movie actually had a STORY and a PLOT.  That it is not to say that I thought it was perfect. I agree that Dafoe's performance was a bit over the top and some of the dialog sounded like it might have come from a 60s comic. Further, some of the CGI did not come off perfectly and the laws of physics seemed to be ignored in a couple of cases (the cable car scene especially).However, Raimi blows away Burton when it comes to telling a story.  Evil Dead II is an alltime classic.  Also, the Gift and the Quick and the Dead were both fine movies (though I don't think either was great).Raimi is also good at characterization.  I don't see how anyone could knock Maguire's performance, or Dunst's for that matter.  They actually portrayed characters.  Keaton's acting in Batman was defined by his lack thereof. And I like Keaton.This movie is up there with the original Superman movie for all time great comic adaptations, and it is not as corny.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A Great Tobey, Much Fine Acting, but M.J. Needs Those Acting Lessons","Enjoyed Spider-Man, mostly for the nuanced performance of Tobey M.

Unfortunately, Ms. Dunst *really* needs to follow through on getting her acting lessons, as her M.J. character suggests.  Her delivery is so wooden, so flat, it's inappropriately hilarious.  How could Spidey be in love with a stacked piece of redheaded cardboard?  There's no chemistry there whatsoever and it's to Tobey's credit he faked it for her the whole time.

An entertaining and faithful adaptation of the comic,"It's a shame that I didn't see this movie back at 2002 when I was a little kid, but since it's almost celebrating it's 10th anniversary with The Amazing Spider Man coming out this year, I'm going to review all three Spiderman films starting with this one. The reason why I'm giving this an 8/10 is because it's a more faithful adaptation of the comic book it was based on and tells the origins of how Spiderman came to be perfectly.Sam Raimi's direction is surprisingly superb and the cinematography is flawless, but I think that the atmospheric music score from Danny Elfman, the groundbreaking action, the visuals (great CGI included) and an excellent cast (Tobey Mcguire did a great job portraying as the brainy and awkward nerd before transforming into Spiderman after getting bitten by a spider. Not to mention kicking some a** in the process. Kirsten Dunst was very cute as the love interest Mary Jane and the interactions between Mary and Peter are brilliant. J.K Simmons did a good job as J. Jonah Jameson, the grouchy news publisher who fired everybody which caused me to laugh my butt off. Arguably, I think Willem Defoe steals the show for not only his scary, but his over-the-top performance as Norman Osborn and the Green Goblin. Other actors including James Franco and Rosemary Harris are also pretty good as well) are the only strongest aspects of the entire movie.The only two complaints that I do have with this movie is the clunky editing and it's corny Dialogue (""The Itsy Bitsy Spider Went Up The Water Spout"", ""And when she got out of the car, and you saw her for the first time, you grabbed me and you said, ""Aunt May, Aunt May, is that an angel?"", ""You have a knack for saving my life.

Pretty Good,"As usual, no over-hyped film can meet my expectations, but the more I think about ""Spider-Man"", the better I think it is.First, the good points: The acting is good, the story is strong and the effects are great(though at first they seem a little fake). Once Spidey and the Green Goblin started fighting I was in heaven. The film also makes some good changes from the comic, like Pete not making the webshooters, and the pivotal scene with Uncle Ben is done more believably.Now the bad points: Too much build-up. The film is more than half over before we see a fully-costumed Spider-Man. It seems like he's only in the last 45 minutes or so. Unfortunately, that's when the film really kicks into high gear, and it's too little too late. I enjoy a good story too, but like 1989's ""Batman"" we see too little of the hero. I hope the sequel will make up for it. If the film had another half hour or so of Spidey in action, it would have been great.Overall, a good but not great comic adaptation.

I do not feel like I wasted my money, and I cheered on Spidey/Peter with the rest of the audience. But the Green Goblin was REALLY corny. Willem Defoe is a great actor, but what could he do with those terribly scenes talking to the mask etc.? The best part of the movie was Peter's self-discovery of his new abilities. The basic good vs. evil part of the plot flopped in my book. I haven't been to a movie in a long time where I actually rolled my eyes and laughed at how stupid some things were, especially dialogue. Laughing at a ""serious"" line is not a good thing. I will go see the obviously-on-its-way sequel, but probably not on the first weekend. Does this replace the classic Superman? I don't think so. Does this rate against other great movies like Crouching Tiger (like another reviewer suggested)? You HAVE to be kidding! I was, however, intrigued by the preview for The Hulk directed by Ang Lee.

The best superhero film of all time?  Maybe,"An extraordinary example of the superhero genre of action films -- it manages to create in the audience a sympathy with Peter Parker (Maguire), the high school student turned ""Spider-Man"", as well as a sense of shared, vicarious joy as spidey discovers his tremendous powers.  The movie is fun and funny, Raimi providing a fast-moving arena for the excellently realized CGI spidey to do his tricks (just watching it made me want to go buy the game for X-box, but I haven't gotten around to it yet).  He must face the Green Goblin, his classic foe, played to a 2-sided malicious tee by Dafoe, whose character doubles as a big-time weapons manufacturer.  Dunst and Franco are merely adequate.That rare kind of superhero film that left me itching for the sequel -- bring it on, Marvel!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The first superhero movie to get it right,"In 2002, one movie proved what no one thought possible: Superhero movies were a genre almost untapped in potential and capable of generating millions of dollars world-wide. ""Spider-Man"" showed that costumed crime-fighters have a multi-generational influence and a mass appeal if kept under one condition: they are about the people behind the mask.What makes ""Spider-Man"" a film that transformed a genre and a whole decade (so far) is that at its heart it is a story about Peter Parker, a normal, geeky kid who comes across great power (that he learns comes with great responsibility). It is an origin story, not obsessed with the action and what the hero does as much as why he does it. Director Sam Raimi clearly connects with Peter Parker and knows exactly how to portray him. Tobey Maguire is an actor that gets at that. There is nothing hunky or masculine about him, yet he is beloved in the role, because through him the audience connects to Peter Parker more than Spider-Man. That connection being so strong then allows for everything Spider-Man does do to become more interesting, exciting and moving. You are with him and Raimi every step of the way.The very reason ""with great power comes great responsibility"" has become such a heavily quoted line is because when the script hits you with it, you're totally ready. After some great action and an interesting story with a compelling villain in the Green Goblin (Defoe) and strong character relationships, ""Spider-Man"" becomes a hit with its final scene. More important than the movie itself, however, is the way this film altered the course of Hollywood for the next decade, a decade that will be remembered that way forever.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The first big success of Marvel,"There is no doubt that 2002 has seen the birth of the best first party has ever had a superhero on the big screen. Many consider this film as part of his childhood, even adolescence. With this title many we have grown, we have excited and even cheered for excellence that brought us Sam Raimi. The years will pass, but the winner will remain the glorious 2002, as I saw from the beginning what would be the best superhero adaptation at the time, and, without doubt, the best first of all films of superheroes . A large repertoire of actors, Tobey Maguire with the size of the character, as well as a lucid Dunts Kirsten in his role and, of course, Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin by one of the greatest villains in the superhero movie, I even encourage say the cinema in general. Spider-Man is a film which many have sinned could not see at the time, as they have lost, perhaps, one of the biggest releases of the history of cinema.

A strong Marvel entry,"One of Marvel's flagship characters finally makes it to the big screen and with Sam Raimi at the helm, you have a sure-fire winner. The first half of the film is as expected, fantastic. It has just the right balance of humour and action and although Tobey Maguire's acting talents are rather limited, he manages to pull off the dorky charm of Peter Parker with some success. There's a lot of humour in the discovery of his powers and how to use them and the supporting characters are all believable. It also shows the motivations and character development of Spiderman really well and rarely descends into schmaltz. Unfortunately once the tights go on, things are not quite as strong. The Green Goblin was never a particularly interesting character and although the schizophrenia plot line is clever, Defoe holds the attention far more as the disappointed father than a dayglo action figure on a hover board. Raimi handles the action nicely though and it's worth it alone for J. K. Simmons whose hilarious J. Jonah Jameson steals every scene he is in.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"A Bit Cheesy, but an Important Superhero Movie","This is a movie that I saw in theaters and I loved it. Growing up I had collected some Spider-Man comics, watched the cartoon that came out in the 1990s and he was just a character that I loved. He was tied with Venom as my favorite. When this movie came out, I was excited. I've seen this movie quite a bit throughout the years. Jaime and I watched this in prep for Spider-Man: No Way Home.We get the origin story here by first meeting Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire). He is bullied at school, but he's a smart kid. He lives with his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) and Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson). His best friend is Harry Osborn (James Franco) and he is in love with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). One day on a field trip, he gets bit by a radioactive spider that ends up giving him his superpowers. After tragedy and graduation, he moves into the city with Harry.Now I should point out that Harry's father is Norman (Willem Dafoe). He is a scientist at OSCORP and they're trying to create super soldiers. With the threat of losing their funding, Norman experiments on himself and becomes the Green Goblin.What I'll say is that this movie hasn't aged all that well, especially with the CGI we get now. Despite that, I think this is still a fun movie. Maguire does a good Peter Parker and I love the whimsical nature he brings to Spider-Man. There's a good cast around him with Dafoe as a great villain. I love that the Green Goblin bleeds over into Norman as he goes on. Outside of them, we have a young Franco, Dunst, Robertson, Harris, J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson and even Joe Manganiello as Flash Thompson. This movie isn't as serious as it could be, but I think Sam Raimi shows how great of a director he is with this movie. The cinematography is probably the best part to be honest.My Rating: 7.5 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
spider hero,"I know this is cheesy, corny or any words to describe it, but as a spider-man fan I found it really entertaining even though it is laughably cheesy in it's dialogue and acting but you'll have fun with it.To me Tobey Maguire is a better Peter Parker than Spider-Man but I still like him as the famous web slinger, Kirsten Dunst as MJ is pretty good and J. K Simmons is a perfect actor for J Jonah Jameson along with the actors who played Uncle Ben and Aunt May.The effects and CGI is a bit dated but it looks cool even though it looks fake, the web slinging and action scenes were fun and the 3rd act final battle with Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin with a silly looking outfit.The Spider-Man outfit looked close to the comics and the organic web shooters from his wrists that comes from inside him instead of using the makeshift web shooters but I like the interesting change to it.Be entertained, laugh and have fun watching beginning to end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Thank god for rain, thank god for ( Y )s","Saw this yesterday, and can say I was reletively impressed. Good, not too heavy entertainment and great direction and cast performances, Kirsten Dunst very satisfying as the traditional female superhero love interest from my pervy perspective.

The Legend of the Web-Swinger,"Having grown up in the 60's, I, like so many millions of young teens were introduced to Spiderman through the medium of Marvel comics. Now through the magic of Hollywood Cinima, American audiences are further introduced to ""Spiderman"" the movie. The imaginative comic writer, Stan Lee is credited with bringing his web-swing character to life and does a 'marvelous' job of transferring the lonely, troubled teen to the big screen. His original concept is that of a young, book-worm, nerdy teenager who is accidentally bitten by a radioactive spider. Nearly dying, Peter Parker, (admirably played by Tobey Maguire) awakens the following day and discovers that instead of killing him, he has been transformed into a super hero with astonishing powers. Everything from his spider senses to his incredible spider strength, Parker is at first convinced he can make some easy money, by exhibiting his abilities in an arena. Unfortunely, his perception of why he was chosen is changed when his seeming ambivalence turns to tragedy with the death of his favorite uncle. The film is imaginative and laced with action scenes which enhance the comic-book-hero's' exploits. With the additional talents of Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin, Cliff Robertson as Ben Parker and J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, the film proves it is slated to become a classic. ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
too much anticipation,"The times I end up enjoying movies most are when they suddenly promote it and the following week it's released. This way,there isn't all the hype and hence anticipation. Let me say that first,I'm a huge comics fan (including Spidey) and I don't at all have a problem with the changes in the basic story arc. Mind you,I prefer Peter inventing his own webshooters but that's a small complaint. The movie simply didn't capture Spiderman. It was too much flash and not enough substance. Yea,it told a story that wasn't paper thin but it didn't communicate it very well. I'm not altogether sure that I'm happy with the takeover of computer animation. I enjoy it to enhance but certainly not to dominate,which is what it did in Spiderman. Oh well,I'm sure there'll be a sequel. I personally would like to see them do Venom. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's got its web on me.,"My Take: A challenging comic-book summer blockbuster with all the thrills you have come to expect, and more.There's much buzz about this movie before it was released, and even if I unfortunately missed the film in its theatrical release, I managed to catch up. SPIDER-MAN is the ideal summer blockbuster, and the fact that this film was a highly-praised summer attraction is understandable. Packed with state-of-the-art special effects creations that parade in front of the screen like magic, but also powered by a great story and a sharp focus on characters, SPIDER-MAN is a web of gold.Tobey Maguire is ideally cast as Peter Parker who, after being bit by the radioactive spider, is turned from ultimate nerd into the ultimate superhero of the title, but you all know that. But the film makes everything else interesting for the audience. Instead of being just your fairly typical summer event picture, living it up with special effects alone, this one actually has a story to boot, and interesting characters ranging from Parker, his family and the villain, Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), who turns into the evil Green Goblin. Director Sam Raimi doesn't dumb this one down as a visually exhilarating and incompetently plot-less summer picture. What SPIDER-MAN turns up to be is a terrific roller-coaster ride of an adventure, which gives audiences have much to think about.Although the sum of the parts are often uneven, SPIDER-MAN is still a wild ride of a summer movie that'll knock your socks off. And yes, it does live up to its hype.Rating: **** out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Enter The Web of Spider-Man,"Now that enough time has lapsed since this movie was released and that the series of Sam Raimi/Tobey Maguire Spidey movies have reached an end, i feel OK to give a full, frank revue of the movie, without feeling like a stick in the mud against the universal praise the movie received on its release, and with enough nostalgia for the film as i remember it. For me the movie never quite captures the pure white heat enjoyment of the greatest Spider-Man stories from Marvel Comics. Raimi never quite gets to grips with the danger and excitement of Spideys world. Whilst the action sequences and special effects are truly awe inspiring, the world in which they are presented feels too much like a high budgeted Power Rangers remake. This is in no small part due to the glossy Production Design by Neil Spisak and the airy, breezy cinematography by Don Burgess. Both commendable by any event movie standards, but at the sake of a translation of a dangerous, fun, darker world that existed in Spider-Man comics since the 60's, 70's, 80's. Tobey Maguire gives a solid, earnest and emphatic performance as peter Parker/Spider-Man, and im sure for a whole generation Maguire will be the definitive Spider-Man actor. Spidey in this movie, and its two sequels is not the comedian with the heroic side readers of the comics are familiar with, and i think this is a potential problem. Maguire gives a sweet, innocent, driven performance as Peter Parker which clashes with his earnest portrayal as Spider-Man, unfortunately this means the character at times can come across as bland and boring. Willem Dafoe is a great choice to play Green Goblin and he does so with relish, unfortunately they completely messed up The Goblins costume, which in the battle scened with Spider-Man looks like two Action Figures in conflict. It would have been much more interesting to utilise Dafoes already Goblin like features and to have gone down a more Jekyll and Hyde road. Its the revisionist approach to the chronology of the characters that weighs the movie down. Kirsten Dunst is excellent as the girl next door Mary Jane, but it would have been better had they started with a Gwen Stacey as Spidey's first love interest, purely because the origins compared to the comics are somewhat jumbled. Danny Elfmans theme is completely uninspired, it recycles elements of his own Batman/The Flash/Darkman themes and is over lush and melodramatic, failing musically to capture the danger and excitement of Peter Parker/Spider-Mans world. For an origin story, Sam Raimi really sets up the character and story arc well. But its tantalising to think just how amazing this movie could have been, so its with excitement i look forward to 2012's Andrew Garfield starring/Marc Webb directed Spider-Man reboot, which promises to capture a real flavour of the best Spider-Man stories. Spider-Man (2002) however is a lot of fun and for an origin movie and one of the most important movies for Marvel Studios, it does its job nicely.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Sort of Movie That Makes Life Great.,"This movie is great in almost every way. This is one of the movies that helped get me into all the comic book stuff when I was in my early teens. Well, the character of Spider-Man anyway. Now, six years on, Spider-Man is one of my favourite comic book characters and Stan Lee is one of my heroes. It gives a really good origin story in the beginning that stays pretty true to the comics for the most part. Sure there were changes made to the story in some parts, but it was still pretty close. The origin carries into a pretty solid plot, which really works as a Spider-Man movie.The acting was really good, and I felt the actors all portrayed their characters well. I thought that Tobey Macguire made a really good Peter Parker and a decent Spider-Man, James Franco was really good as Harry Osborne, and I think I'm one of the few people that thinks Kirsten Dunst made an alright Mary Jane Watson. They all had great chemistry together. You could really imagine that Mary Jane was the girl that Peter loved, and that Harry was his best friend. The father/son relationship between Harry and Norman Osborne was pretty believable. All the actors just worked really well together, and I believe good chemistry works really well toward making a good movie. Even the supporting characters are perfectly cast, like Uncle Ben, Aunt May, J Jonah Jameson and Betty Brant seemed as if they were straight out of the comics.The storyline is pretty cool. It's filled with lots of drama, when you get to see Peter feeling different things throughout the movie. Guilt, love, confusion. You get to see the transformation of a nerdy, weak teenager into a powerful hero. It's not just about some kid who gets bitten by a spider and becomes a superhero, it's got a whole lot more depth than that. And for the most part, the actual storyline doesn't just feel like filler until the next action scene. That's part of what sets it apart from a lot of other comic book movies. Some of the dialog in the movie is a bit cheesy, especially some of the stuff between Peter and Mary Jane, but I don't really let it bug me.The action scenes are really good, although a little fleeting for the most part. They just seemed over too soon sometimes. They were still really cool though, and were definitely some of the high points of the movie. The costume designs are really good as well. The Spider-Man costume looks awesome in about 132 different ways. Apparently the changes that were made to the Green Goblin costume in comparison to his comic counterpart caused some problems with fans. I think the changes were necessary to avoid being too cheesy. And his new costume looked awesome anyway. The special effects in the movie were pretty good, especially in scenes where Spidey is swinging around. There are some scenes where it does look a little fake, but it shouldn't take away from the movie for people. But I know people do like to whine about every problems in movies, so some people might find the effects an issue.All in all, it's an awesome movie, and we were lucky enough to get two sequels to it. I've watched it a few times, and it holds up well. A fairly re-watchable movie. It was one of the movies that helped start the modern Marvel movie trend, along with X-Men and the Blade movies before it. Just another great thing it had a hand in. Sam Raimi is a great director. Spider-Man is a great character and was really done justice in a movie that could have easily been awful.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Surprisingly enjoyable,"Before I go on, I'd like to establish that I had no intention on seeing this movie in the first place.  I've never read the Spiderman comics, and I didn't buy my tickets in advance.  Of course, I've heard of Spiderman in the past, but I didn't know anything about his superpowers, arch enemies, etc. prior to this movie.  And guess what?  I was very impressed!Tobey Maguire is a fine actor, but I wasn't sure how he'd fill the shoes of a landmark superhero.  Playing Homer in ""Cider House"" is a lot different from playing Peter Parker in ""Spider-Man.""  But he is totally convincing in the lead role, and I can tell he worked out a lot to prepare for this role. Kirsten Dunst is...well...her beautiful self.  She flashes her beautiful smile, going through the motions as the helpless victim.  Sure, she did a fine job, but she didn't have much to work with.  The great Willem Dafoe steals the movie as scientist Norman Osborn who later turns into Spidey's arch enemy, The Green Goblin.  Dafoe is perfectly fiendish, as always.  I had no idea he was going to be in the cast, prior to seeing the movie, so I was very impressed to see him pop up on screen.  Cliff Robertson is great as Parker's uncle.  And, I forgot the actor's name, but the guy who played Jameson is also a scene-stealer.  I loved his scenes, which were reminiscent of the fast-talking farces of the old days.There's a lot of action, a lot of excitement, good special effects and touches of humor to boot.  I can't complain.  The plot is by-the-numbers superhero fare, and there are no real surprises.  Nevertheless, I was entertained throughout and not a minute left me unsatisfied.  In a way, ""Spider-Man"" brought out the kid in me, but even the most discerning adult viewers should be impressed.  Trust me.This is one big-budget summer blockbuster in which I can honestly say it was worth every buck!My score:  7 (out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

True to the Spirit of the Comics,"Sam Raimi with this film vibrantly brings to life the world of Spider-Man and his many supporting characters. This film's plot--a mix of elements from the comic stories involving Spidey's origin and The Green Goblin kidnaps Gwen Stacey (although here Gwen is replaced by Mary-Jane Watson) epic was I feel just right for the first Spider-Man film. There's loads of action and one can easily get lost in the fun of epic of Spider-Man as easily as if one was reading one of his classic comic book adventures.However everything in this film is not roses...for one thing, they weren't being anywhere near careful enough about Spider-Man's secret identity as it should be obvious to a good many in this film who Spidey really is (and not just the Green Goblin either) and another the CGI is haphazard...sometimes it looks great, other times it just looks too cartoony and fake.

"An awesome picture, damn near perfect","This is the film that will forever be credited with the revamping of the superhero industry, and definitely deserves that merit. It's a superhero movie at the finest level with motivated characters soaring action sequences and truly devious Nemesis. Let me just say that Tobey Maguire was the perfect casting choice for Peter Parker. For better or for worse he will probably always be remembered as Spider-Man and that because by the series second installment he had totally immersed himself in the role and you did realize it was him anymore you just saw Peter. Im not a Kristen Dunst fan at all but she did give a great performance in this. James Franco used this to establish himself as a very solid convincing actor. Then there's Willem Dafoe who truly is a great actor and is consistently underrated. He played such a great villain helpless, lost, and a borderline weak person as Norman Osborne. When he becomes the goblin he's a wise cracking, evil, motivated and powerful killer. Kudos also go to Cliff Robertson, Rosemary Harris, and J.K. Simmons for playing their roles true, entertaining and in Simmons case funny. The plot was great because it felt like you were watching a comic-book film which made it fun and involving. I never read the comics but they seemed to stay true to the source material. It's also never cheesy or under-developed which is essential to a superhero film.

Horrible for something that should've been better,"With the expectation that the summer 2002 season was to be one of the most exciting in years for moviegoers, I was hopeful that the fierce competition would rub off in finally bringing about the better qualities often lacking in blockbusters these days. Not only did Spider Man fail in that regard, but I was quite disappointed by the fact that it actually had the potential to be a very a decent film. The liberal use of cliches which I wasn't expecting really caught me off guard. Didn't these guys learn anything from the dismal Batman 4 movie? That wasn't the worst part, however. The wooden acting by what should've been a stellar cast, at least on paper, fell flat on its back, while the continuity and lackadaisical visual effects suggested to me that this was a rush job. How the heck duffers like this and ~Batman & Robin~ were even allowed to see the light of day, and still be able to pull in as much money as they did is totally mind-boggling and disheartening. This I can only attribute to ""business as usual"" in Hollywood.... it's less a matter of quality, and one more of hype and hype and hype w/TV commercials until the masses come a flocking like sheep to a shepherd. Baa-aa-aa-ah! If somebody recommends to you that this movie is great and you should go and see it, don't believe them! If you're curious, just wait until it comes out on video and rent it for $1.

Rare summer blockbuster that not only lives up to expectations but surpasses them,"Frankly, a serious, realistic film version of Spider-Man is an impossibility. How, pray tell, does one make a movie with a character like The Green Goblin or Dr. Octopus without making the audience laugh? That's why Sam Raimi was the absolute perfect director for the Spider-Man movie. He's got the most uncanny ability to entertain the heck out of the audience while they are laughing at how tremendously silly the whole thing is. This comes from the Evil Dead section of his career.Now, from the more recent side of his career, like The Gift and A Simple Plan, Raimi brings the ability to people Spider-Man with good characters. Some of them are straight from the comic book, sure. Rosemary Harris' Aunt May is a perfect version of that character. And Willem Defoe's Osbourne/Green Goblin. He's so cartoonish, well, let me reserve a special place later on to talk about Defoe's performance.Now, Peter Parker, Mary Jane, and Harry Osbourne (Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco respectively) are amazingly well realized. I did the same double take that everyone else did when they heard that Tobey Maguire was cast as Spiderman. Huh? That kid from The Ice Storm? Well, he's been very good in several movies (he was also poorly cast in a few movies, too, especially The Cider House Rules), and Raimi obviously cast him because of his acting skills. He could have went for the kid from Dawson's Creek or something, but he was right to get someone who could actually act. Kirsten Dunst may be the most underrated actress out there right now. She's been in some for-the-money projects, surely, and this is another one that'll pay her big. But in the meantime she lands some great roles, things like The Virgin Suicides and Crazy/Beautiful. Even the weak stuff she improves simply by her presence. Spider-Man isn't one of her best performances, but she's good. I like the early stuff, her problems with her terrible parents. It's actually kind of disappointing that they leave that character baggage almost completely behind Mary Jane after they graduate and move into the city. She is more or less relegated into the role of damsel in distress at that point. James Franco, who plays Harry Osbourne, is exceptional. I believe that his character becomes a super villain in the comic book, and that suggestion is left with us at the end of this film. He projects a lot of personality, more than his character actually has in the script.Now for Willem Defoe. No, he's not bad. Exactly the opposite. This is where the film goes way over-the-top, deliciously so. The Green Goblin is a great villain. He's nearly at the same level as Jack Nicholson's The Joker. Willem Defoe has a ton of great scenes, both as Osbourne and as The Green Goblin. I love the seen where he has a conversation with his evil mirror reflection. Critics are kind of complaining about Defoe's performance, but I think it's perfect for the film.Another great comic-book performance comes from J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, the newspaper publisher with whom Peter Parker sells his Spider-Man photographs. His scenes are the best in the film. Hope he has even more next time!My only real complaints about the film are the generous steals from the first Tim Burton Batman film (the balloon parade attack) and The Matrix (the fire sequence). There are so many inventive sequences that it's unfortunate that they couldn't come up with two more original ones.Spider-Man, despite its small flaws, is the perfect example of summer entertainment. I am seriously considering seeing it again in the theater, something I never do for this kind of film. It's probably the only time that I walked out of the theater wondering why the sequel was taking so long to make!Word to Raimi fans: both Bruce Campbell and Ted Raimi. They both have hilarious cameos.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A cartoon springs to life,"Simply probably the best comic book hero movie made, translating to the screen much better than the earlier Superman or Batman epics. The acting is top-notch, the story line is fun and well-paced, and the computer graphics are excellent. What probably makes this so much better than the others, however, is the human qualities and frailties and doubts built into old Spidey -- his trademark. It brings him to life and makes him seem much less comic-bookish than other such heroes. It is indeed a three-dimensional character, rather than one- or two-dimensional. This one is just plain fun, guilty pleasure, with the bonus of being superbly written, acted and directed as well.

The Green Goblin's silly costume hurts an otherwise very good film,"Spiderman has all the ingredients of the best comic-book superhero movies: a likeable leading man, a beautiful love interest, strong sexual tension, a villain played by a top-notch actor, cool special effects. What lets it down is an odd thing for such a big-budget movie: a silly costume.The movie is strongest in its opening half, when the characters are being introduced and Peter is learning his new powers. One of the best scenes in the movies is when Peter stares in delight at the new muscles he's grown overnight and flexes them in the mirror. Every skinny man's dream. Tobey Maguire is an excellent Spiderman: he has a wide-eyed sense of wonder and innocence about him that helps us feel both his pleasures and pains. There is also genuine chemistry between him and Kirstin Dunst, something which feels all the more real after the horrible attempt at romance in 'Attack of the Clones'. There are some corny lines and sometimes when Spiderman is web-slinging his way across New York it does feel like you're watching someone else playing Playstation, but overall director Sam Raimi has done a fine job.But back to that costume. It's not Spiderman's that is the problem, indeed reliable sources tell me that Maguire looks quite sexy in his skin-tight suit.Rather it is the Green Goblin, who looks like a cross between a carnival clown and a cheesy, plastic-armoured 'Star Trek' extra. Willem Dafoe is convincing as both loving father and vicious killer, but as soon as he puts on his mask he becomes just another raving maniac in a ridiculous outfit. Because of this it is hard to get involved in the fights between the hero and the villain, the centrepiece of any superhero movie, which is why I would rank this below such films as 'X-Men', 'Superman' and Tim Burton's brilliant 'Batman' movies.That aside, Spiderman is a good film, and its huge success in the States will produce several sequels. I look forward to seeing Maguire and Dunst in them.6 1/2 / 10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An Enjoyable Sclockfest,"Spider-Man is a movie that watches like the start of a franchise rather than a film of its own.  We sit, watch, laugh a little, and leave happy, if a little less than satisfied.I'll skip the plot synopsis, you already know.Tobey McGuire makes great use of his famous face in creating the Peter Parker character.  We love the fact that he is a dork in any role, and this is no exception.  He is believable as a nerd, and his unmasked scenes are effective, and genuinely enjoyable.  When he gets swept in to action is when we lose interest a little.Kirsten Dunst gets the job done as Mary Jane, or M.J., her terrible androginous nickname in the movie.  She can act, but doesn't need to try very hard to fill the role.Willem Dafoe is surprisingly endearing when he needs to be, as the Green Goblin.  He could have used a better mask though.  Perhaps one that won't so obviously turn into a Halloween mask this fall.The scenes with interaction between the main characters are nice, sweet, sometimes a little touching... blah blah blah.When it comes to the action scenes, once the novelty wears off you almost forget you're watching anything.  The fact that that you know you're mostly looking at a CGI Spider-Man shooting through New-New York (Post 9-11) doesn't help the movie keep your attention.  But oh well that doesn't really repel audiences does it?In the end you find that more than just the Twin Towers got changed.  The people of New York emerge as the real heroes, awwww. And I didn't think it was possible to end it with an American flag, but director, Raimi, manages.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Impressive!,"This movie helped the superhero movie genre so much. Yes it's got very cheesy dialogue and can be a bit dumb at times, but it's such a charming film. Toby Maguire is a good Spiderman and an even better Peter Parker and the origin story was handled very well. Now keep in mind this isn't the most comic accurate representation of spidey as... well... he shoots webs out his body (and nowadays people are mad that he didn't make his suit) but keep in mind this is 2002 we're talking about. William Dafoe is incredible here and i love the Goblin as the villain (though not the costume, that was real bad). Great story in general that sets up the other movies and very enjoyable fight scenes! Such a fun movie, and a great start for this great character on the big screen. I'm giving this an 8/10 and not a 9 mostly because the effects have aged badly and the movie is not perfect. Still it remains one of my favourites from my childhood! Also JK Simmons as JJJ is a match made in heaven!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spiderman- Slightly flawed but a sound base to build on,"First of all let me say that it is always difficult to introduce a Superhero to the big screen and provide a sound base for future sequels to build on. Superman managed it, The Fantastic Four on the other hand didn't. Spiderman is somewhere in between.I preferred No. 2 to Spiderman No.1 because in Spiderman they spent too long explaining the origins of Spiderman, actually this is one minor problem with the first Superman movie. On the other hand I thought the villain in the Spiderman No.1 was far better than the one in Spiderman 2. Williem Dafoe was superb as the Green Goblin, he was terrifying. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst was also superb as Peter Parker and Mary Jane. If the responsibility of bringing the web slinging Superhero had fallen into the wrong hands it could have been a whole lot worse. Not a bad effort at all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This is an excellent film! Wow!,"""Wow"" is right. From when I first heard about this movie to when I actually rented the DVD (thus being the first time I've seen this movie), I thought that ""Spider-Man"" looked like an extreme thrill ride! Exciting from the very first minute on! And in summer of 2004, I rented the DVD, and guess what? I was right! This IS an exciting film! In fact, I've made this my favorite action film! I guess I made such an excellent decision about renting this film back in the June of 2004. Why? Because that summer, I was going to go see ""Spider-Man 2"" in the theater!

Entertaining and true in spirit...,"I have to admit that I wasn't exactly looking forward to Spiderman, in fact, I was even loathing it, so much so that I'm only now seeing it for the first time on DVD. While I do like Spiderman, lets just say that the execution in super hero movies is very much hit and miss. Luckily, Sam Raimi, himself a fan of everyone's favorite ""Non-Mutant Superhero,"" has a hit on his hands.Visually speaking, Spiderman offers plenty of eye-candy, and while it's not altogether convincing at times, overall, it's quite impressive. The CGI is well-done, and aside from a couple of stiff animations, manages to convince you that you're seeing Spiderman on your screen. While the Green Goblin persona is a bit different visually from the comic's antagonist, it's for the better, and offers me a bit of hope on the level that Marvel will be able to dish out when it gets around to the Iron Man movie.Acting is a mixed back, with some very flat performances by some of the cast, the Dafoe is excellent as the maniacal Green Goblin (wouldn't you love to see him as the Joker in Batman?). Maguire seems wooden at times, but is generally good, and is able to convey a lot of the emotion needed through his facial expressions. The only other notable among the cast would be J.K. Simmons, who nails J. Jonah Jameson to a ""T."" Once again, Kirsten Dunst is nice to look at, but just doesn't feel right for this role.Overall, though not the best super hero movie to date, it's an entertaining flick that fans of the comic series will love. There have been some changes made from the comic (the ""web glands"" being one of the more noticeable), but actually work in this case, probably due again to the fact that Raimi is a fan of the material.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The sequel is already in the works.,"Peter Parker is supposed to be -- at least pre-spider bite -- a nerdy wallflower with little personality. That being the case Tobey McGuire was casting genius.I wanted very much to like the big-screen adaptation of the Marvel Comics hero `Spider-Man.' I'm not sure why but I was disappointed.The score by Danny Elfman was good -- but only in places.The script was entertaining -- but not consistently so.The photography was sometimes great -- but again, only at times.I believe that is why `Spider-Man' didn't win me over: It was inconsistent.The action scenes -- particularly when Spidey was flying through the air with the help of his self-generated webs -- moved too fast, taking away some of the Gee-Whiz factor.James Franco -- the son of the Green Goblin/Norman Osborn, played by Willem Dafoe -- though up to the part was probably cast because of his cheekbones, making him actually look like he could be Mr. Dafoe's progeny.Kirsten Dunst was the best thing in the movie. Not to put too fine a point on things but especially for the scene in the rain and that sweater.There was lots of violence with a message that violence, in and of itself, can solve problems; not something I would want to teach a child.The movie seemed longer than its official run time of 121 minutes -- not a good sign.Not everything about this movie was bad.  Watching Peter Parker discover his new body and how he fumbled with learning to use his new powers was entertaining and the nice update of a genetically enhanced spider (from a radioactive spider in the comic book) was a good touch. The animation sequences were wonderful with the touch of the genius that is Stan Lee.If you are going to see this movie you should probably see it on the big screen -- or in the very least on a widescreen DVD -- the action is not going to fit on a small television set.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Stands the test of time...,I remember watching this movie in theatres many years ago and I remember that I was mesmerized.The movie itself is pretty good and as a comic adaptation it's pretty decent.Nowadays we have the MCU spider man and Andrew Garfield's reboot but this movie still stands the test of time.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The best and worst Hollywood has to offer,"One one hand this film sets the standard for what a Hollywood superhero movie should be. Instead of camping it up or trying to take the story to another level that throws away the fundamental ingenuous appeal of the original comic (which is what happened with both the television and film incarnations of ""Batman"") it is a true live action comic book, presenting its juvenile, melodramatic subject matter with sincerity and a straightforward graphic flair that without being at all obvious about it provides a genuine analog to the classic Marvel style.On the other hand, the fact that it is nothing more than another extremely costly Hollywood comic book come to life makes it infuriating viewing for anyone watching with a brain not on idle. Seldom has a contemporary film dared to present such a blatantly retro-Hollywood misogynist worldview, with its musclebound, power-obsessed male protagonists demonstrating only the most primitive interests in the only two female characters, a deferential old lady (ROSEMARY HARRIS???? isn't this a little like casting Laurence Olivier as Grandpa Walton?) who mainly exists to serve food and a young woman (Kirsten Dunst, augmented breasts jutting awkwardly from anorectic ribcage) whose purpose is to totter on high heels between encounters with males bent on raping/murdering/courting/protecting her. Watching pretty Toby Macguire ecstatically shooting through the air on threads of spermlike ""silk"" and stolidly rejecting the woman he ""loves"" because he has more important things to do than actually stick around and have a relationship with her--like zipping around in the night chasing other muscular fellows in tight suits with his sperm-thrower--tells you all you need to know about subtext here.

A very solid Spiderman Story,I think this movie had a mission and accomplished it to be honest at the beginning it took a minute to pick up but once it did it was very good one of those movies that just gets better as your watching it and to be honest out of all the spidermen toby seems the most relatable idk Spiderman in general is relatable but each of them have their own relatable aspect that differ from the others idk it's hard but there def pieces that feel very relatable here I also enjoy the MJ story line and what they did with her a lot it really tugged at the heart strings and made me passionate about their relationship the most out of all the spidermen. I think they made Harry a bad person tbh or at least a bad bro like bro but whatever. Oh I LOVED Willam Defoes performance he did an amazing job like top tier movie villain actor.

Unforgettable story of the Amazing Spider-Man!,"Both Spider Man and X-Men were one of the first super hero films of the new millennium, the ones that kick started the popularity of such genre, that led these films to be one of the highest grossing ones of all time. Today I'll talk about the origin story of Peter Parker directed by Sam Reimi.Anyways, Peter was just an awkward student, who wanted to work as a photographer and has a huge crush on his classmate Mary Jane. But one day on a field trip to a science museum, he gets bitten by a radioactive spider. And afterwards, he got powers like spider sense (seeing things in slow motion), web making, and crawling on walls. But with great powers comes great responsibility. Sadly, one of the people that Peter loves gets killed, despite that, he tries to use his powers for good. There's also another important character in the story Norman Osborne, who after a failed experiment, becomes possessed by the Green Goblin and threatens the life of others, including his son Harry and his girlfriend's M. J.
Even though the story is cliche, it's still engaging with the action scenes. Especially when Peter uses his web to swing around on heights or when he fights with criminals. I like the fact that it balances both the super hero and the high school plots, proving us that the double life can be tough. The protagonist prefers to keep his new identity a secret from anyone, otherwise his life will get even worse, especially if any villain discovers that.Peter is also a relatable character that deals with lot's of problems like the death of a loved one and confessing his feelings to M. J. Most people in real life deal with these situations thus making Parker more down to Earth. The only difference that he has is obviously his new spider abilities. He understands that these powers must be used for good, and it's not easy to live with them. But some doubt his heroism, like the journalists, who actually think that he's a criminal. As for the villain, Norman is the businessman that wants to stay on top and make sure that his son Harry gets all the same respect. Once Norman becomes Green Goblin, all he wants in life is to defeat our hero or make sure he joins the bad side. Norman is a menacing villain who is very manipulative, especially in the end. Mary Jane is a nice girl who only treats her classmate as just a friend. She is also an aspiring actress, yet she works as a waitress to get money. Not really prominent as the first 2 characters, yet her acting by Kirsten Dunst was well done. She acts like a real person, that is also relatable to teenagers, specifically girls. Other characters include Harry, uncle Ben and aunt May. All of them have some kind of relationship to the main characters that progress the plot further.I also like the brief drama aspect, that makes the story emotional and it makes the audience feel for the characters, especially during one death scene. But it's mostly an action film, so it mostly focuses on these aspects.At the end of the day, Spider-Man is a must watch Super hero movie with great action scenes, relatable characters and simple yet interesting plot. Even for those who aren't major fans of such genre, can find something good for themselves. It's a classic example of the genre and a great hit at the same time. Personally, I think it deserves the title of being amazing! I hope the sequels will not disappoint me and keep being entertaining further.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Just a bit more than a run-of-the-mill superhero flick; but does it deserve all those votes?,"In the end, it's just another superhero versus supervillan movie. Yes, the angst of Peter Parker is an interesting addition - both in the original comic strips and in the movie, but the second half of the film is so formulaic that this overpowers the better points. Having said that, unlike other reviewers, I thought the effects were very good and at a large screen cinema, Spiderman swinging through New York streets nearly gave me vertigo, they were so good. The Green Goblin character was pretty banal and the amorous scenes between Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson were some of the hammiest I've seen. The music accompanying these scenes was also 'so predictable'.Casting on the whole was good with Tobey Maguire quite perfect in his role as Spiderman/Peter Parker. It is such a shame that a potentially good film was let down by such a weak script and - towards the end - such unoriginal treatment during which the characters become more and more cartoon-like.Sadly, as I write this I see that Spiderman is already in the top 250 films around the 120 mark - a reflection that even IMDB's excellent chart is open to the most recent and over-hyped films achieving far higher positions than they truly deserve. Had Spiderman been released ten years ago I am sure far fewer people would have voted for it and would give it far lower ratings. It is sad that these inclinations cannot be compensated for, even with IMDB's vote weighting. Director Sam Raimi made a 10/10 movie a few years back, 'A Simple Plan', based on an excellent novel, it doesn't figure on the charts as it was an undersold, under hyped movie, yet here is Sam storming up the charts with a film based on a shoddy script that in my opinion rates 4/10.One final point, I watch my favourite movies (some highly rated in the IMDB charts - such as 'The Usual Suspects', 'Godfather' & 'Shawshank Redemption' - to quote a few) many times over, and I certainly would not consider watching Spiderman again, though I'm perfectly happy to have seen it the once.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"As a kid you loved the cartoon, as a grownup you wished those days back","As a young kid you got out early of bed just to watch those marvelous marvel comic book hero's on television like the 'amazing' Spiderman. This one almost got me wishing I'd stayed in bed that day...I have to say that Spiderman the movie isn't that bad, but something about it just said to me that it was a just above average kind of film. Peter Parker a real full time freaky nerd in the beginning of the movie? They could have portrayed him much better then that, he didn't look like the science wiz to me either. The movie was more focused of him being Spiderman, maybe even too much, instead of Peter Parker himself. But to know more about Spiderman, you have to learn more about the person behind Spidey. And what about Flash Thompson? He looked more like some blink 182 fan rather than a college football star without the brains. The best character in the entire movie was without a doubt J. Jonah Jamison, superbly acted by J.K. Simmons. He blew me away with that performance!The scene on the Brooklyn Bridge was truly pathetic, Mary Jane Watson looked like Xena when the Green Goblin took a poke at Spidey and had the cable swinging heavily, she still could hang on to it instead of dislocating her shoulders. Seconds later she drops like 50 feet and grabs hold on to the bar like she was Xena again, didn't she Sam? Then comes the part of ""When you mess with one of us you mess with all of us"", wich was America at it's 'best', but to me sounded so lame like a bad dialogue of some Hercules episode.Spider-Man is a nice movie, but could have been much greater, Sam Raimi did use some elements from other movies which I thought was great because it blended in perfectly (Balloons =""Batman""), but next time he needs to keep those Xena and Hercules stuff out. Peter Parker did some flips with his fight with Flash that reminded me of Xena. The only real thing that was great about the film were the visuals. They were really mind boggling, and that's why I give this movie a 7 out of 10, but this movie doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the top 250 movies of all time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
2.5 stars,"Peter Parker (played by Tobey Maguire) is a very smart, very socially awkward high school student who lives with his aunt and uncle. He is in love with Mary Jane Watson (a.k.a., ""M.J."", played by Kirsten Dunst), and has been since she moved in next door when they were both children. One day they are both on a field trip, and a genetically altered, radioactive spider bites Peter. He feels ill and goes home to fall asleep. When he wakes up he begins to figure out that his body has changed. He is far stronger, can stick to surfaces, and then there are the webs.Meanwhile, Peter's best friend's father, Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), runs a large company attempting to sell advanced technology to the military. When an experiment in human augmentation stalls, he decides to make himself a human guinea pig, and he begins his transformation into the extremely schizophrenic Green Goblin.That's just the set-up. There's a lot more story, as Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man, and then, with the help of his uncle, figures out what Spider-Man should stand for. Tobey Maguire does a better job of this transition than most actors one might have thought of casting for a superhero role would have, but he isn't given enough to work with. And Kirsten Dunst has even less to do. Willem Dafoe might be the stand out, but only because he is supposed to chew the scenery and does, quite effectively.Director Sam Raimi is apparently a huge fan of the comic book hero, and he has given this film a distinctly comic book feel, starting from the comic book opening credits. This can be charming at times, but, for me at least, falls flat at many others.

The answer is a yes and no. He has his moments in certain scenes but some scenes with Mary Jane or M.J. stumped me. Perhaps I didn't read his character well in this movie.. or they want to show his obsession with M.J. through facial expression - but I find his silent and grim smile slightly disturbing. Maybe that's just me..The other actors did their parts well especially J.K. Simmons as JJJ. And Aunt May is bigger than I imagine her to be..As for the overall feel of the movie, it's fun and heart stopping everytime he climbs the walls and swinging over skyscrapers. It is certainly a better watch in comparison with a certain other ""insect movie"" currently showing.The story follows well with the comics except for one thing.. how he got his web ability. It was artificial and scientifically created in the comics but in this movie, they made it a natural side effect of the spider bite. Oh well.. they can't fit everything into a 2 hours movie - look at LOTR but it's understandable.As a last note, the pace is okay and some 'look at my face to guess what I am supposed to be feeling' scenes could be omitted.

Again, Kirsten Dunst was a strange choice I feel, she portrayed Mary-Jane as very needy and desperate, and on a more personal level, I didn't think she was really pretty enough to play her either.

It thankfully didn't score the action sequences with the latest ""rock music"" like The Matrix did. Sam Ramai definately made some effort to not make Spider-Man as dated as The Matrix will be in 10-20 years.Tobey Maguire and William Dafoe have always been excellent actors. I really like Maguire's performance in Cider House Rules. But beyond that, the acting was wooden, especially in some key moments such as the scene with Uncle Ben in the station wagon, and the final graveyard scenes. The actors, especially Kirsten Dunst, sounded like they were reading lines rather than speaking. It wasn't the writing, just the performances, and it really hurt the film most during many of the emotional or philosophically important scenes. This is what really brought the film down to a mediocre C level. Action, special effects, and heroic derring-doo don't make up for weak performances. Allot of this film is for Joe Sixpack, who goes to the movies for laughs and action and snickers at everything else. If it wasn't for the fact that it's attached to the Spider-Man comic book, the film would have been forgotten in just a few short years.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Much better than I expected,"Spider man has always been my second least favourite (Mickey Mouse holds the first place) comic hero, that's why it was surprising, that I actually liked the Spider-Man movie.Much thanks goes to Sam Raimi, who has shown to us with his previous, and this, movies that he knows how to direct cartoony, yet still greatly flowing live action movies, like Darkman was.And then we have Willem Dafoe, who as Green Goblin steals the whole movie, which wasn't unexpected: villains are always more compiling than the good guys.Tobey Maguire isn't bad as Spider-Man and he tries he's best to make the character as complex as possible and he does deliver couple of funny jokes as Spidey.Kirsten Dunst however is left far too much in the background, so her portrayal as Mary Jane (love interest of Peter and Harry) is anything but complex.So in all pretty good superhero flick, which provided a nice surprise to a non Spider-Man fan.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but does not live up to the hype.","Spider-Man is my all-time favorite super hero. I read the comics religiously as a teenager. I was very apprehensive about a big-screen adaptation. All the ads made the costume look cheesy, the Goblin looked really lame, and they made his web-shooters ""built-in"". After watching the film, I have to say that I enjoyed it. It was not as bad as I had expected, in fact, it was actually pretty good.

"This Early Superhero Smash, Which Helped Jump-Start the Modern Craze, is Showing its Age","The webslinger's first foray onto the big screen, and in many ways the grandfather of the big Marvel juggernaut that's been chewing up the box office for the last decade. Sam Raimi's vision of Spidey and his pals is true to the essence of the character, with a vibe that's often reminiscent of his '60s debut, while still feeling modern and serious when needed.It boasts an extremely effective cast, despite selecting a few actors I don't usually enjoy. Tobey Maguire makes an appropriately awkward, plucky Peter Parker. Kirsten Dunst is sweet and charming as his lifelong next-door crush. James Franco shows range as the troubled best friend. J.K. Simmons was positively born for his bit role as the hot-headed J. Jonah Jameson. And, of course, Willem Dafoe brings a fantastically expressive act in the villainous role of Norman Osborn, the Green Goblin (though he's often, sadly, relegated to mere voice work behind a stiff, metal mask).It has spirit and humor and character, but it also has a habit of over-reaching and a wince-worth tendency for ridiculously awful dialog. Even in print, it can be tough to keep this character from sounding corny and stilted, and in live action that's doubly difficult. The script constantly trips and stumbles over itself, trying and failing to seem cute and off-the-cuff, and Raimi's direction (itself known to lean on the cheesy side) always has the actors winking at the camera while their puns are falling flat.The plot is solid, planting handfuls of seeds for future storylines while effectively setting up the current conflict, though it does have a nasty habit of over-indulgence. A double backflip during a schoolyard fistfight, for example, when the leap alone would've been enough. That kind of exaggeration is all over the place, and not only isn't it necessary, it actively ruins the immersion. I remembered really enjoying this upon its release, and it's still entertaining viewing, but much of it hasn't aged well, particularly in light of its modern counterparts.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Too sentimental from a Spider-Man movie.,"Spider-Man was a good movie, but there was too romance between Mary J. Watson and Peter Parker.

It was better than expected, and a lot better than other films in the genre, like batman and X-men.If you expect the plot to follow the comic books page by page you will probably feel a bit cheated.

"Honestly, I'm not a fan of Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man","I'm not saying I hate it, because I really don't. I just think, compared to the other Spider-Men actors, this one falls a little short. The acting was alright, nothing exceptional, really, and might I say, even a bit too theatrical, and the actors and actresses they chose fit their roles nicely. I think Maguire was a little too old for this film, portraying a high school student, but he still delivered. The action was good, despite the over dramatization of it all. I wish we saw more of the character's personalities and got to know them a bit more personally. The plot was okay, it was interesting but still a bit strange. The music score and actually one of my favorite parts about this film, I thought I was very unique. The humor was good, I suppose, and it kept me engaged. The special effects were alright, but I understand that it's been a while since this came out and I shouldn't hold it against them. Just...if you can't stand old movies or even slightly old ones, maybe don't watch this. With better execution of the plot, I think this would've been a good movie. Overall, this movie just fell a little short and was a bit bland, but relatively good compared to other movies I've seen today. Spider-Man was a bit disappointing, but was alright. Not the best Spider-Man portrayal, although, no hate to Tobey Maguire. Perhaps because he was the original people liked him better? I'm not sure. In the end, it was a decent movie that could've been executed better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spider-Man vs. Peter Parker,"For me this felt like two films - Spider-Man and Peter Parker.The latter is the story of a geeky kid amazingly transformed into a superhero while pursuing a career and the girl of his dreams. It is the most interesting part of the duo. On the plus side it had the reliable Toby Maguire portraying convincing teenage angst, laced with wide-eyed humour at his newly adopted powers. On the downside, I found Maguire and Kirsten Dunst a bit laconic at times, though fault probably lies with the helmsman Sam Raimi for his static handling of their scenes. They basically just stand and talk to each other while the music tries hard to drown them out. Couldn't they have walked or something? Parker takes to his new powers like a duck to water without ever really questioning or having any doubts about them. It all seemed a little too pat. Also, one major plot point - the identity of the car jacker - was a real give away, then never really dealt with.As Peter Parker the movie dissolved into Spider-Man the movie it got tangled up in its own webbing. The action scenes were functional but never engaging or thrilling. One main problem was that the hero and villain were masked and thus not able to exude emotion or personality. The director tried to circumvent that a couple times, including the final battle, probably realizing the problem. Also, the web-spinning scenes were very cartoonish and I never had a sense of danger or of ""being-there"". Whenever Mary Jane was going to fall it was obvious that Spidey would swoop in and save her, thus there was no sense of danger. There's also a plot device in a fire that was telegraphed, hence making the ""predictable"" line seem like a bad in-joke. Somehow Spider-Man zipping around the tops of buildings just wasn't exciting to watch. I would have bet that it would be, as I'm sure the filmmakers did, but some things just don't come off well on film. It's just the way it goes. I remember my favourite shot from the old TV cartoon - it was of a two-fisted Spidey coming right at the camera. I can't remember any specific shot from this film that had the same thrilling effect.It was nice to have the story of Peter Parker come to the big screen and see what they could do to Spider-Man with modern computer technology. Unfortunately, the latter was ""not much."" Now that the story of the geek gone vigilante has been told, it doesn't bode well for the sequels.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Pretty Good Film,"Don't get me wrong. I love Spiderman. I love the comic books, I love the TV show(s), and I like the plot they chose for the film. Still, this is not a masterpiece. it's a good movie that is revealed to be just a good movie when you compare it to its sequel.Sam Raimi and the actors obviously had fun with this film. The camp level is pretty high at parts, and the intensity never seems to be turned on. The CGI is easy to look at, but pales in comparison with either of the film's sequels. There are a lot of things to like about this movie. For instance, Tobey Maguire, Jmaes Franco, and Kirsten Dunst are all very good in their roles. In addition, the location shots are gorgeous, and the whole movie flows in a fun, relaxing manner. This is where we come to the film's major problems.1. It's relaxing. The action never elevates to a level where you actually need to worry about any of the likable characters. The supposedly intense and scary scenes are not very scary or intense at all. Also, the film is too in love with its location to worry about anything else.2. The green Goblin was a terrible villain. The costume was about as cheesy as it possibly could have been, and the voice-overs from the helmet seemed like something out of ""Power Rangers."" Wllem Dafoe is not to blame for this, of course. The scenes with Norman Osborne and no mask are expertly crafted. There simply aren't enough of them.3. The film is boring at parts, and has low replay quality. If I had to watch it more than once in a day, I would probably fall asleep five minutes into it the second time. there's simply not enough action, and the romance isn't developed enough to make it interesting.Overall, ""Spiderman"" is a flawed film with a good heart. It's worth a rental, but perhaps not a buy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A mixed bag...,"***SPOILERS*** While it's more or less faithful to its source material, Sam Raimi's Big Screen treatment of SPIDER-MAN often teeters on the verge of outright idiocy. How, for instance, could Peter Parker drag a lunch tray around a high school cafeteria, in front of scores of witnesses, with webbing shot from his wrists... and not be found out??? These lapses in logic (which occur throughout the film) work against the powerful, poignant moments that give the movie its emotional resonance. Nor does it help that the movie often drags laboriously along like Raimi's infamous FOR LOVE OF THE GAME. The fx vacillate between real-life believability and video game cheesiness of the LORD OF THE RINGS variety. On the plus side, there are the performances and a sometimes beautifully moving script and superb cinematography and sets and music and touches of directorial brilliance (as with DARKMAN and much else he's done, Raimi distinguishes himself here as a very capable filmmaker when it comes to fx-heavy material). SPIDER-MAN is a mixed bag, to be sure, but it's definitely worth the price of admission.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Since that first viewing, and with the added fact that I immediately bought it when it arrived on DVD, I have finally started seeing the cracks. I think the long and the short of the movie's faults lay in its screenplay, which leaves a person wanting.

Every web-slinger has his day.,"Spider-Man is so far my biggest disappointment when it comes to super-hero movies.Okay, the film had great action-scenes, special-effects and fairly good humour.

It could have provided so much insight and second narrative type energy to the film. As is, it feels like the film-makers exiled me from Parker's mind.Another problem was the villain. Okay, it's true that Spider-Man doesn't exactly have the best villains-galore around, but the film-maker's attempt to actually make the Green Goblin cool just felt like a wasted effort.

For a concept that was over 20 yrs in the making & heavily anticipated by millions of fans, the final product is a vast disappointment. The producers do very little to enhance the classic story of Peter Parker & his transformation into Marvel Comic's most popular hero. I found the CGI to be substandard, most of the time our hero LOOKS like a rubbery computer-generated puppet akin to JarJar Binks. The battle sequences are uninspired & many elements are stolen from countless other FX-driven films. The Goblin's costume looks like a plastic horror, why not simply stick with the classic fabric version from the comic books? The acting is mostly average to dull with the exception of Tobey Maguire who does his best despite a mediocre script.

Enjoyable...but Batman is better.,"I want to compare this movie with the classic Batman movie from 1989. The movie resembles a lot to the classic by Tim Burton, but Spider-Man fails in delivering strong characters. In the Batman movie the character of Bruce Wayne is deeply affected by the murder of his parents and the movie explains how he has become the person he is. In Spider-Man Peter Parker is bitten by a spider and the action starts from there, now that's just a little too simple for me. I also thought the Green Goblin was kind of a corny villain. The suit he wears is incredibly boring and looks a lot like one from the Japanese Ultraman. Also character building is an issue here, Willem Dafoe does a fine job, but his character isn't really frightening. Compared to Jack Nicholson's Joker he is just a wimp.

"The focus here was the transformation of Peter Parker an introverted guy without confidence, Spider-Man, whose powers were beginning to bring you great responsibilities","After the success of other characters in adaptations to the big screen, especially with X-Men (2000) director Bryan Singer, it is natural that other adaptations would come around. In 2002 came the turn of one of the great comic characters of winning his first adaptation: Spider-Man. And it would not be an easy task, since it is one of the most popular heroes, collector of millions of fans around the world, as popular as Batman and Superman, for example. The arachnid world's most famous first appeared in the magazine ""Amazing Fantasy"", in August 1962, in his 15th and final edition, and like other dozens of characters, Spider-Man was created by Stan Lee who was responsible for its creation and the concept of the first adventures of the superhero, while Steve Ditko, was assigned to be the principal designer, is also co-writer of several of the stories of Lee's Spider-Man.Who first became interested in bringing the hero to the movies was the renowned director James Cameron (The Terminator, Terminator 2: Judment Day, Aliens), who wanted even to Leonardo Di Caprio embody the hero. But due to problems with the production and rights, Cameron just ever abandoned the desire for adaptation, especially when you got involved with ""Titanic."" What Cameron is one of the greatest in its function, and we have no doubt is an eternal curiosity for fans would be like to have him in charge of the adventure. Later it was revealed that the treatment of Cameron's script, which came to be delivered to executives, brought as a mixture of the main villains Kingpin with Electro, and the Sandman, and also proposing the controversial web launchers organic and constructed and show the hero's love interest, Mary Jane Watson, as a girl digger and depressed.Luckily for fans, the script was discarded, but the ideas of Cameron still serve as the basis for a future definitive treatment given by the renowned director, writer and producer, David Koepp. The writer, who had big hits on his resume of movies, such as Jurassic Park (1993), Mission: Impossible (1996), Panic Room (2002), Carlito's Way (1993), made occasional changes in story of Cameron and finally delivered a script that was accepted by Sony.With the script in place, began the task of finding a director. After probing names like Chris Columbus (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001) and David Fincher (Fight Club (1999)), was chosen Sam Raimi, director of the films low budget horror The Evil Dead (1981 and Army of Darkness (1992), and good thrillers The Gift (2000) and A Simple Plan (1998). Initially the director - even being declared fan of the Spider - did not seem to be the ideal choice, but the good work in the last two films mentioned earlier, led Sony to give a vote of confidence to the director. Choosing director to leave the movie with a villain and not two as was originally planned was not crucial to the hype on the screens.Tobey Maguire was then called to live the great hero. The actor had already had good roles in movies such as the great Pleasantville (1998), Ride with the Devil (1999), Wonder Boys (2000), Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas(1998), and The Cider House Rules ( 1999). Although at the time of filming the actor be 26 years, it ends well with a convincing teenage college by his appearance and especially for his acting ability. It also brought a dramatic maturity necessary for the character crafted by young and experienced actor, who once took off his career in Hollywood.The script by David Koepp has as part of its inspiration the famous comic titled ""The Death of Gwen Stacy"" in the first girlfriend of Peter dies while being attacked by the Green Goblin, who played from atop the George Washington Bridge (although Drawing comics is of the Brooklyn Bridge) in New York. This was the basis for the entire climax of the film version. The script has, however, has a few caveats. In translating the comic to the big screen, one of the most bother the fans was the fact that Spider-Man shoot organic webs and not through a device designed by Peter Parker. It really takes away the scientific genius of Parker, which was not as well used as well in the movie, but the solution to be something organic is much better explained. If he was bitten by a genetically altered spider and acquired numerous other features like spider sense of danger determined, able to climb walls etc, because he could not have webs to be born, to come out of himself? An explanation is fully consistent with the reality of the character. Could be followed as in the comics, but the solution is no attack on the arachnid and not something badly explained or flee from the very well-known by all.Another point of controversy is the apparition of Mary Jane and not Gwen Stacy, Liz Allen - who later became the wife of Harry Osborn - or even Betty Brant, the secretary editor J. J. Jameson at the Daily Bugle. However, as stated earlier, it is more known to the general public was chosen to be the face of her love. What was strange was put Mary Jane in situations - especially the climax of the film - instead of Gwen Stacy in the comics. An enigmatic scene in the comic was shown as the Queensboro bridge collapse caused by the Green Goblin, but as Mary Jane. Who knows the background story can bother a bit about it.Leaving aside these two topics essential qualities script Koepp are many. Approaching the hero even more teenage audience, showing that in fact it could be anyone, not necessarily the strongest, but a shy boy, awkward, skinny, who wears glasses and who is not rich or powerful. Spider-Man is not just a powerful being who protects the city of criminals. It is also the Peter Parker, a young student who needs to work to survive and help his uncles home. It is the most humble and the most human of heroes with flaws and virtues, causing an easy and immediate identification with the audience.David Koepp wrote the script for the film acts very different and interesting. Almost half of the film was to present Peter and how he became Spider-Man. By now the boy knew well and track changes in your body caused by genetic mutation is sensational. If at first he thought of making money with the powers, family tragedy, and posture to assume the responsibilities of his alter-ego fighting enemies that would arise were a radical change in the youth's life. The events are occurring with impressive fluidity, and occurs very gradually transforming Peter, causing torçamos for him all the time. One of the virtues of the script and direction was perfectly balancing the action scenes in the novel. Who does not remember the iconic scene of kissing Mary Jane Spiderman upside down? And the statement that Peter does for Mary Jane indirectly when they are in the hospital next to Aunt May? And when they talk in the backyard of their home talking about the future after graduation? Or when she says to him in the final scene and he is forced to reject her for not wanting to ever let her in danger? Are romantic moments, simply furnished and involving the audience so exquisite.Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn did very well. He is a scientist who, pressed by the government decides to make experimental tests that end up changing not only your physical but also your mind. Norman ends up becoming the Green Goblin and has a reason for it. There is only one character in a single facet, no depth and has the sole purpose of ending everything and everyone. Here his relationship with his son is shown and justified their actions.Since the action was a little aside, as a source movie. The famous jokes that Spider-Man ever talk to combat crime were a little aside and focus more on the emergence of the alter-ego of Parker. The focus here was evidently the transformation of Peter Parker an introverted guy without confidence, Spider-Man, whose powers were beginning to bring you great responsibilities. But as it would be in a blockbuster, we have some great sequences like the first fight between Spidey and the Green Goblin-event Oscorp, the great final sequence involving the Queensboro Bridge Mary Jane, a group of students, Spidey and Goblin Green.The soundtrack by Danny Elfman (Batman (1989) Batman Returns (1992), Edward - Scissorhands (1990)) - collaborator Tim Burton minutes long - is certainly one of the best parts of the movie, knowing thrill and engage in moments of romance and drama and making us embark on the wild action in a landmark paper, clearly be an adventure more cartoonish and less dark and gothic as composed by him for most of Burton's films. We can even say that this first foray into movie character is a film about responsibility, personal growth and romance, surrounded by several memorable action scenes.The special effects cannot be without service. If today we look back and see outdated special effects, with the movements of Spider notoriously well-being artificial (classic example is the race of the Spider and the buildings their heels when Peter discovers his powers, and of course the jumps between skyscrapers) at the time was what was more modern. Allied with photography done by Don Burgess and art direction by Neil Spisak, was actually very faithful to the comics movement by skyscrapers local flights sensational, all movement in the body of the spider like to stand crouching, the release of webs, and frames using centralized closes over as if they were the angles of comics.The first adventure Arachnid is a big hit movie and it would create two more sequences becoming one of the highest grossing franchises of all time. We have plenty of mood and action scenes efficient. Most scenes happens day and violence is used very sparingly, yet there is no blood thrown on the screen or something so brutal. Guaranteed fun, with humor, adventure, action, romance just right.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Too many flaws,"While the film does have a lot of good aspects (Sam Raimi's direction, the casting especially with Tobey Maguire and Willem DaFoe), there are four main gripes with this film that always impinge my enjoyment of it.Plot holes. The wrestling promoter would know Spiderman's identity (after seeing him pulling off his stunts in the ring), and also has an axe to grind with him - after he did nothing to prevent the robber from taking the money. For some reason however he doesn't bother to go to anyone about it when he could charge a lot of money to reveal Spiderman's alter ego.His origin. This may seem like a geeky fanboy quip, but I thought that the events leading up to the murder of Ben Parker and the creation of the crime-fighting Spider-man made Peter appear particularly inhuman and bitter. The scenes also lacked the emotional force of the comic, or even the 90s animated series.Badguy deaths. I could accept that the thief who murdered Ben might have had an accident where Spiderman would be on a thin line of did he/ didn't he kill him, but when the same fate befell the Green Goblin, it stank of a cop-out by the makers.Yankee heroics. As a non-American filmgoer, I find it disgusting that we must once again have American culture (or the movie version of American culture) rubbed in our faces. The scene on the bridge was bad enough (""You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us"" or something similar had most of the people in the cinema rolling their eyes and groaning - why didn't the Goblin just pumpkin bomb them anyway?) but to end the film with Spiderman on a pole with a huge waving USA flag just made it worse. In a film such as Superman, the character's Americanism can be tolerated as he is known for being an American hero, but Spiderman is supposed to be a world hero - someone everyone can look up to, as even Raimi said.There is also the topic of incidental music and theme, or lack thereof, but I don't think that any major gripes can be drawn over miniscule details such as that. The (mostly poor)CGI and reappearing boom mic also distracted. Also, was it necessary for Kirsten Dunst to get her shirt wet? I'm not complaining, but gratuitous sexual images both p*** me off and turn me on at the same time. Must be the hormones.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spidey versus a Power Rangers villan,"This movie has some good visual effects, but the story isn't anything new and the Green Goblin is pathetic. I think Mr Raimi must have got a Power Rangers cast-off for that mask. The Batman Joker was so much better as a villan... the green goblin just looked like a tacky merchandising effort... I bet the toys look just like the movie! It could have been worse, but it does not deserve to beat Attack of the Clones...",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Slightly disappointing,"Could have been the best superhero movie ever made...and came very close, but just seemed to lose steam.  The initial hour or so, when Peter is discovering his powers, is excellent, but once he puts the suit on the movie seems to run out of gas.  Add to that incredibly bad dialogue, poor costume design for the Green Goblin, a very bad performance as Mary Jane by Kirsten Dunst and inadequate character-building of Uncle Ben (why should we feel Peter's grief when it is never shown that the two are that close?) and you have just another summer blockbuster...entertaining, but very forgettable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Shame it's a kids film,"This could have been a better film, but because it's meant to be a goodish influence on kids, the producers had to stuff it full of morals, and 'good over evil' stuff. I know some people will think it helps the story, and it does in a way, but for me it's far too predictable.If it wasn't a film for kids, it could have had an element of black comedy of some darker twists, and that would have improved it greatly. But for me, it was merely an average film that i wouldn't bother seeing again.Overall I would give the film 6 out of 10. I also wouldn't let younger children watch it without parents, as some of the best bits (the violent fight scenes) definitely aren't suitable for young kids.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The First Outing,"The first outing for the infamous web-slinger brought a tonal shift to superhero films. It was realistic while still being true to the comic book source material. With some great action scenes and entertaining web-swinging, Spider-Man is what he is today because of this film.That being said, the weakest actor in this film is the protagonist. Tobey is not as interesting as I remember and his awkwardness lacks the charm of future Peter Parkers. Luckily Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin is phenomenal.The dialogue was painful at times and it lacked some much needed levity, but it's still a memorable film.

boring!,"Simply said: I don't understand all the hype about this film. Yes, the effects are spectacular, but the rest is simply boring.

An Inside Look.,"To start of - I saw this movie at the cinema 2 times, and have to say that both times were as enjoyable as when i saw Spider-Man 2. Before i saw Spider-Man i was surprised (In a good way) of the actor-set. Especielly with J.K Simmons (Also actor as Schillinger in one of my favorite shows, Oz.) as Jameson, Tobey Maguire from The cider house rules and Wonder boys), and, of course - Kirsten Dunst (Remember her from the one year earlier movie Crazy/Beautiful and early years Jumanji).I've always had an appeal for long movies, and this movie is about 2 hours, (as you probably already know) and i wasn't surprised over the choosing of Villain - Green Goblin. Even tho the connection between Spider-Man the Movie and Spider-Man the Comics is very thin, its still was a great movie, one of the best I've ever seen, actually.The thing i'm missing in it was the humor that Spider-Man showed in the comics, - Now, i know that increased in Spider-Man 2 - But that's not the point. Where's the jokes? A big minus for that part.I also read that Tobey didn't even read a glimpse of any Spider-Man comic before, so i'm very, very surprised that he could act Peter Parker without even knowing his style. The 2 of them are the same (in some restrictions, that is.)Well, That's all i have to say, plus i rated the movie 9 out of 10.Cheers!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good But Not Record-Setting Good,"The movie is good, and I can't think of a kiss better than Tobey/Kirsten's, but it's far from deserving so many box office records.   I doubt very much Spider-Man will be considered for awards that aren't visual effects or sound related. *I* certainly wouldn't consider it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Follows Basic Story of Comic Origin,"The cast and crew did a spectacular job.  All costumes were great and well thought out, but a few minor changes made me leave wanting more.  Peter not making his own web-shooters changed everything for me.  The way he was bitten and the green goblin's demise were also slightly different.In the comic Spidey sometimes runs out of web fluid and it makes for comic relief, which is very important for Spider-Man.  He is a superhero with a great sense of humor.  But even though they changed these things it was still a good comic adaption.  Better than Batman, but not as good as Superman.  The sequels will be great, the origin movie is always the tough one.  They should be able to do some great stories!!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Overated comic book movie!,People were saying that the Spiderman movie was great but it was not as great as people said it was. What I was disappointed at the movie was the changes they did to the characters. I say the characters were changed WAY TOO MUCH. 1) Spiderman had hair growing out of his fingers like if he was a warewolf. What's that suppose to mean. You never got that in not even 1 comic book issue. In realife if a person had hair growing out of his fingers people would hate him every time he walked around. 2) The Mary-Jane character sucked totally. She looked like she was 55 years old than 20 years old. She looked more like a grandmother for crying out loud. In the comics or the show she looked like the proper age and had better charisma. If I was in charge of the cast I would replace Kirsten with Paula Gerces( the actress from the movie Clockstoppers). Paula Gerces would play a hell of lot better Mary-Jane character. 3) I say the Green Goblin was changed too much. His mask in the movie didn't move when he spoke and they waste money on a heavy armour suit which made him look more like a robot and he moved his arms in slow motion like if he was the Freakin TERMINATOR. The exploding grenades looked more like oranges which made it more suited for a child. In the comics they were exploding jack-0-lanterns. The green Goblin in the comics and the TV show had greenn and purple and his soft mask moved when he spoke. In the movie like The GREEN GOBLIN looked like a stiff character that had been plaigerized from the GREEN HORNET. 4) It had too much love in that movie and it is supposed to have ACTION in that movie.I liked the X-men movie better because at least the characters where only changed just a little. The only changes the X-men characters had was there clothing which is what you get in comic books too. Nothing less it wasn't too bad a film.I recommend watching TOMB RAIDER or JACKIE CHAN MOVIE instead because at least they aren't taken seriously and there better.6/10,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fun Blending of Fantasy With Some Reality,"""Spider-Man"" is ""our local neighborhood super hero,"" according to the TV theme song played at the very end of the movie credits, and for our family he is, as there were several scenes shot in Forest Hills.That nicely grounds the fantasy in reality, as does Tobey Maguire's terrific performance with his insecurities and growing self-awareness of his powers.The movie is a lot of fun, with some LOL jokes, though I tuned out the repetitive fight scenes. This isn't the first movie to stage derring-do on the 59th Street Bridge putting the Roosevelt Island Tram in danger (I think it was ""Escape from New York"" that did that cool), but it's effective. But is the abandoned manse he tracks the villain into part of Goldwater Hospital?Poor Kirsten Dunst has very little to do, except be a damsel-in-distress, which is too bad. But that rainy kiss is a sure winner for the MTV Movie Awards.Most of the negative reviews have been of Willem Dafoe's villain, but I thought he was quite effective.For James Franco this is pretty much a prequel, setting him up to be the villain in ""Spider-Man 2.""Danny Elfman's music swept the action along.(originally written 5/11/2002)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Along Came a Spider,"Not as good as the best ""Superman"" and ""Batman"" movies, but better than the worst. ""Spider-Man"" has one of the best origin stories in comics; and, much of it hits the big screen intact. What makes the story of downtrodden young Peter Parker's transformation into the extraordinary ""Spider-Man"" so memorable it's the fateful decision he makes NOT to use his new powers to stop a criminal, early in his career. Later, he learns ""with great power comes great responsibility."" The impact of this powerful lesson in heroism is a little diluted by the addition of the ""Green Goblin"", and other alterations, into the preliminaries. It's still a powerful story.The film's main weakness is it's descent into near cartoon state for much of the ""Spider-Man"" and ""Green Goblin"" action. After Tobey Maguire (as Peter Parker aka Spider-Man) and Willem Dafoe (as Norman Osborn aka the Green Goblin) successfully bring their characters to life, they are ""re-animated""; however exciting, the special effects dehumanize the characters. The ""Green Goblin"" story is not as effectively told as in the comics; but, the arch enemy father (Mr. Dafoe) and best friend son James Franco (as Harry Osborn) are well cast.Director Sam Raimi works some marvels. Nice to hear Spider-Man say the magic word, ""Shazam!"" and hear Rosemary Harris (as Aunt May) tell him, ""You're not Superman, you know."" Nice to see Cliff Robertson (as Uncle Ben). And, leading woman Kirsten Dunst (as Mary Jane ""M.J.""

What a ride! More Fun Than Batman!,"A fun, enjoyable action flick with a super cool story line, this is without a doubt the best movie I've seen all year! If I were the casting director, I might have picked someone other than Tobey MaGuire. But the chemistry between MaGuire and Kirsten Dunst is undoubtably what landed them the parts. Also, William Dafoe is no Jack Nicolson (as the Joker) no question. But then who is as great as Jack -- NOBODY!  And, compared to Batman, this script was written for a younger audience. But ya know what? You could also argue Tim Burton's Bruce Wayne was too dark and mysterious. You couldn't help but like Sam Raimi's Peter Parker.  But if you take Batman and Superman and put it on a shelf, and look at Spiderman for it's own value, this movie is genuinely good clean fun! The special effects just blew me away.

Possibly the Best First-Time Superhero Film Since Reeve's Superman of the 70's,"The first time an iconic superhero flies across the big screen in his (or her) tights, cape and/or mask, the end product often has mixed results. The bar was set pretty high with the first ""Superman"" film starring Christopher Reeve, Marlon Brando, and Gene Hackman, still probably the finest superhero film ever produced. The first ""Batman"" film, directed by Tim Burton and starring Michael Keaton in the title role and Jack Nicholson as the Joker had problems, some wonderful moments in between lagging scenes. (Some people have called ""Batman"" the best mediocre film ever produced! Or is it the most mediocre film among good ones?) Either way, the end result may or may not hit the mark. Luckily, especially for fans of the original comic book, the first Spider-man film, based on the character created by Stan Lee, works on a level towards the original Superman film.When you boil down the raw elements needed to create a good film, you need three things: a good premise, good actors, and a good screenplay. And let's not under-appreciate the last one. While a good screenplay still may save mediocre acting, often the opposite isn't true. In Spider-man, all three are present in spades. Let's look at them in terms of how they are portrayed in the current film.The Premise. Well, the premise must be a good one because, since its inception in the 1960's, Spider-man has become one of the most important comic heroes alongside Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman. However, Lee brought a bit of a twist to the character. Like other superhero characters who have some magic-like abilities, in this case the abilities of a spider inside a human body, Spider-man's alter-ego, Peter Parker is a troubled adolescent suffering from the typical angst of all young people around that age. Unlike Superman, Parker is still finding out where he fits in. In terms of the present film, the original premise, although updated slightly for the 21st century, is still adhered to. Parker/Spider-man is an angst-ridden kid, loving a faraway female, trying to navigate school, and dealing with bullies.The Acting. The acting takes us right into the heads of the three most important characters: Spider-man/Peter Parker (Toby Maguire), the Green Goblin/Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe), and Mary Jane Watson, a.k.a. MJ, (Kirsten Dunst). Maguire offers both the angst-riddled teen and the resolved superhero. I particularly appreciated the way he was portrayed in the film. Not a bad-looking kid but not a GQ cover model either. He's rather nerdy, a science wiz, like Lee had envisioned him, but not the best at getting dates. The absolute stand-out is Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin/Mr Osborne. Character actors like Dafoe, similar to Gene Hackman as Lex Luther, are the best suited to play villains. Dafoe is terrific as a kind of Marvel equivalent of Two-Face, having two sides to him. On one had he's the upper-crust businessman who's tough but confident. However, the other side, the Green Goblin side, emerges and confronts the ""waking"" self. He becomes a kind of split personality that few actors can pull off, and the scenes in which the two sides speak to one another are entirely believable. Also honorable mention to Dunst who is a very attractive high school girl but certainly not someone who will be entering teen beauty pageants. She attracts the likes of Peter Parker at a very human level.The screenplay, probably the most important ingredient, works well, and much better than the Keaton/Burton ""Batman"". Parker is a typical high school kid just trying to navigate through school, being cared for by his adoptive uncle and aunt since the death of his parents. Then a strange circumstance changes his life: he's bitten by a radioactive spider which gives him spider-like abilities. A nice series of sequences shows him testing his new-found talents. At first Parker uses them to earn money in trashy athletic events, but then he switches gears and decides to use them to combat evil. Certainly we know this will be Spider-man's calling but a conversation with his uncle puts him on track, reminiscent of Brando as Superman's father.On another front, the father of a friend of Parker's, Norman Osborne, is head of a tech company testing a machine which would improve human metabolism in soldiers, probably for the military, a bit like Captain America. Osborne built the company, but now the board of directors are selling the company out from under him. He retaliates by testing the metabolic-altering machine on himself and hence a different side emerges after the experiment. Simultaneously, there's Mary Jane, the distant love of Parker, who knows he exists but is dating a much more athletic and popular guy at school. Eventually, these three stories clash in a wonderful and believable climax. Parker becoming a crime-fighting disguised hero, Osborne becoming an adversary of Spider-man, and Dunst caught in the middle.The story is about transformations. All three characters undergo transformation during the course of the story. Not all seem to relish this transformation and none of them understand fully what it means. Some of them embrace the transformation more than others, but in the end it's unclear whether or not the characters are better for what has happened to them. Two survive the transformation while another doesn't. And that's the mark of a great story: when what seems the inevitable outcome isn't quite what the characters and the audience foresaw. Ultimately, it comes down to caring about the characters and what transpires which evolves them into something else, be they heroic or villainous. Maybe that's the problem with many superhero films, the filmmakers forget that we need to be reminded to care about them, not just be awe-struck when they fly around.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A true super hero movie,"I grew up on Spider-man and have probably been one of his biggest fans as a kid growing up and I was thrilled by the movie when it was reaslied on the big screen. I was just going through my DVD collection when I said to my-self just check it out. However I was actually surprised to see some comments which actually blasted this movie badly. Althouh I am a huge Spidey fan I understand that Hollywood is a big business which actually has money on its agenda first rather than pleasing the fans , and over time I have learnt to live with that and although it can't be denied although one or two things might of been changed in this movie , Sam Rami has sit down and down his research on this. The film is a thrilling ride from start to finish , moves at a great pace and keeps us entertained all the way through with its action sequences and emotional scenes. Tobey Maguire was cast brilliantly as the web slinger and although from time to time he maybe a little tooo geeky , it was all well. Willem Defoe was cast brilliantly as the Green Goblin and although The Goblin was never truly one of my favourites he seemed to make the regather interesting. James Franco and Kirsten Dunst who otherwise I can't stand were class. My only complaint about this was that they had changed The Goblins costume which I felt done the regather no justice but Willam Defoe managed to save that with his body language and use of the SFX. On the whole I throughly enjoyed checking Spiderman out as it reminded me of my childhood and as cheesy as it sounds to me it is still magical.SPIDERMAN 8.7 OUT OF 10WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBLILTY...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us"" - A Review of ""Spider-Man""","Spider-Man is the first installment in the original trilogy of Spider-Man films and it's an excellent start to the franchise. The film follows the story of Peter Parker, played by Tobey Maguire, a high school student who becomes the superhero Spider-Man after being bitten by a genetically altered spider. The film also explores Peter's relationship with his love interest, Mary Jane Watson, played by Kirsten Dunst, and his conflict with the film's main antagonist, the Green Goblin, played by Willem Dafoe.The performances of the principal actors were among the aspects of the movie that I liked the best. As Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst had excellent chemistry, and their performances were compelling and gave their characters depth. The excellent visual effects that went into making Spider-Man also contributed to the overall enjoyment of the film. The orchestrated action sequences also had some thrilling moments. The movie did a fantastic job of transferring the spirit of the comics to the big screen.The pacing of the film was also well balanced, and the plot was simple yet engaging, it was easy to understand and follow. The chemistry between the characters was also spot on, and the subplots were relevant to the story.Overall, Spider-Man is a film that provides an excellent origin story, great performances, impressive visual effects, and exciting action scenes.

With great power comes great responsibility,"If you're in the mood for a superhero movie that's got heart, humor, and some serious web-slinging action, then you need to watch Spider-Man!This movie is the perfect origin story for the friendly neighborhood hero we all know and love. Tobey Maguire is pitch-perfect as Peter Parker, the nerd who gets bitten by a radioactive spider and gains some seriously cool powers. And let's not forget Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin, who chews up the scenery in all the right ways.What sets Spider-Man apart from other superhero movies is how it balances the action with character development. We care about Peter and his struggles, whether it's trying to impress Mary Jane or dealing with the responsibility of being a hero. And while the effects might look a little dated now, they were groundbreaking at the time and still hold up surprisingly well.But the real star of the show is the humor. Spider-Man is a funny movie, with plenty of quips and one-liners that will have you chuckling throughout. And that's not to mention J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, who steals every scene he's in.It's not a perfect movie, but it's a dang good one.

Blueprint of an origin story.,"This is a grounded and honest movie which may come as a surprise given the genre. Raimi tries to find a balance between his polarising humour and the dramatic beats needed to drive a story forward. The humour doesn't make the drama any less hard hitting but if you're not a fan of it not all of its jokes may land. What it does do however is frame this goofy kid in this typical Spider-man world that is always trying to tackle difficult subjects while also not forgetting the silliness of the world its living in.The CGI isn't great, some of the performances aren't great ether but this campy feeling is what sets it apart from other superhero movies.

We also have James Franco as Harry Osborn, the son of Oscorp owner Norman Osborn. I like the film, with J.K Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, the boss of the Daily Bugle. We also have Elizabeth Banks as Jameson's secretary. And many more. I rate this film 10 out of 10. It's my favourite film, of course, some people still watch it. Tobey Maguire is good looking, with his blue eyes. Kirsten Dunst looks fabulous, with her red hair. Willem Dafoe is brilliant, with the good side and the evil side. J.K Simmons is excellent, although he thinks Spiderman is a menace.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"I'm surely biased by my own feelings of nostalgia, but Spider-Man belongs to my favourites list - where it has been for the past 20 years.","I have started a Spider-Man rewatch in occasion of the release of NWH and I'm amazed at how little I actually remembered about this movie. I was 6 years old - almost 7 - when it came out and I was so awestruck by it. Today I had the same feeling after so many years, despite the outdated CGI and VFX which were actually pretty impressive for the time.Tobey Maguire's acting is pretty impressive in spite of his meme status. Willem Defoe is as astounding as ever.The story, the soundtrack, the dialogues make this the perfect superhero film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Easily my favorite of the year... when I saw it.,"Despite the hype, I actually expected the movie to be good -- not great, not bad, just good. I expected the acrobatics to be cheesy and annoying, and (most of all) I expected the villain to be so cheesy that I wouldn't believe in his threat. The ""Green Goblin"" just didn't appeal to me in the trailers. I compared the villain to Montgomery Burns (The Simpsons) in my head on several occasions before seeing the movie, just for the childish, it-could-never-happen feeling he gave me.However, after actually watching the movie, all of that subsided. Tobey was great, Kirsten was great, Willem was great. Given that Spider-Man is a fantasy/action flick, Raim and friends actually made a darn good movie -- easily my favorite of the year (was there ever any doubt?) at the time...At least until Star Wars was released. Now I'm faced with the problem of deciding whether I liked Episode II for Episode II, or because I love the idea of the entire Star Wars universe so much. Either way, Spider-Man is much better as a standalone film, and hopefully it has kicked off a healthy string of successful Spider-Man films in the future.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spidey rules New York and the world,"It had been a long time since I had seen something of my beloved superhero Spiderman. I'd grown to love the Spider man TV, but I quit watching it, after I'd seen them all twice or so. I then later saw, that they were still making new ones, but I have to say, I'd kind of grown out of animated series. I never started do dislike the animated show, but you kind of grow out of all TV shows, because they run for much too long. This even happens when you love the show. You just can't help it. And after a while you start forgetting about your once loved ones' and you turn your head to new things. Yesterday I turned my head to a new old thing'. I turned my head to the Spider Man movie.This movie was supposed to be big. It had made about 750 million  at the Boxoffice and it was listed among the best 250 movies at IMDB, but still I had my doubts. Why you ask? Well, I'd seen some of the music video's and they gave me the impression that the effects were really bad and that the film would be like Blade, a two hour music video. How wrong was I?First of all, none of the songs from the Spider Man Soundtrack are featured in the film, like it is done in the Blade films. The songs can be heard in the background, playing on a radio or so. Second of all, although the effects were bad, I did not mind a bit, since the movie was so awesome, that I did not even notice most of the time.What was great about the movie, you might ask? Well I can tell you what was not in a nutshell: the effects. The rest was pure genius and truly inspired by the comics and the animated series. First of all I have to give credit to the casting bureau. All of the parts were casted really well. Everyone fit in like a glove. Then credits of course go to the director (Sam Raimi) and the cast. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) came over as a real big nerd (even worse than I remember him in the animated series), M.J. Watson (Kirsten Dunst) was very gorgeous, charming and likeable and Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe) was really great as well. The scene, when he's talking to himself in the mirror was really great. The grimaces he made, from one shot to the next, were really awesome.The director must also be credited, for bringing everything fabulously to the screen. I mean, there was nothing really innovative about it, but he was very solid and knew exactly what he needed and wanted. Last but not least I think I owe my thanks to the writers and to Danny Elfman. The writers of this film really succeeded in making up a story and dialogue in the film, that capture the figure that is Spider Man. He is a boy, who could be me (if he looked different). He was very human, a bit shy around magnificent beautiful women, a bit of a loner but basically a very nice guy. Then he gets to have extraordinary power. What is he to do? What will he become? What will happen to his loved ones? Throughout the film we observe the evolution of Peter Parker to become Spider Man. We see what power his new found strength brings and what responsibility. We see his powers upside, but also it's downside. So despite Peter Parkers nonhuman strength he remains a very human and normal figure which the viewer can relate to and that is what makes Spider Man such a great comic figure. A very big thanks to everyone involved for giving me the best two cinematic hours in a long time.9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The hype is not just hype.,"The buzz surrounding this movie you would think it was the second coming, but it is a solid film.  This film was not lacking in any way.  I have heard that Willem Dafoe was a bit over the top with the green goblin, but I am of the opinion that he portrayed the character as he is in the comic.  The green goblin was a wild villain.  The character was over the top.  I do have one complaint.  The soundtrack... it sounded like the Batman score in its tone and pacing.  The soundtrack would have fit better in a movie about the Dark Knight not Spiderman.  This is a great film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Excellent Entertainment,"One of those films that managed to faithfully convey the characters from the comics.The casting is excellent, the characters resemble their counterparts from the comics, not only physically, but also in personality.Of course, it is never possible to transfer comics to film exactly the same, but this is an example of how it is possible to transfer characters from comics to the big screen almost identically.We follow Peter Parker and how he transformed from a scared boy into Spiderman. Tobey Maguire is excellent in the role of Peter Parker, but the rest of the actors are also great.The casting was excellent, the actors fit their roles and managed to portray the characters. Willem Dafoe is great as the Green Goblin, but J. K. Simmons stole the show with his unforgettable interpretation of J. Jonah Jameson. The direction is excellent.The film is really fun, with several good action sequences and does not burden the viewer with unimportant things, but wants to entertain him.Sam Raimi is a great director and he proves it here once again.This is a movie that wants to entertain us and succeeds in doing so.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The Amazing, The Spectacular, The Ultimate: Spider-Man","""Spider-Man"" 2002I remember the first time that I saw the first ""official"" theatrical trailer for ""Spider-Man"" which featured the music by E.S. Posthumus called ""Pompeii"", which the trailer ended with in the climactic ""Nineveh"". From then until its release, I knew that my boyhood dreams were about to come true. This is personally one of the few highly anticipated films that I saw on its theatrical release that not only met but ultimately surpassed all of my expectations, successfully re-channeling my childhood romance with this iconic character & taking his epic tale to even greater heights. ""Spider-Man"" tells the tale of Peter Parker, a mild mannered teenager who constantly seeks acceptance from his peers & ultimately dreams of one day gaining the courage to confess his love to Mary Jane Watson, who is the girl of his dreams. But his life takes a remarkable turn when he is bitten by a genetically enhanced super-spider while on a high school field trip. He miraculously gains superhuman powers that reflect that of a spider's abilities. He finds that he is able to, strangely, shoot webbing from his wrists, detect in coming danger, climb walls, & has superhuman strength and flexibility. After accepting his powers, Peter then seeks to use them for personal gain. But when he fails to stop a criminal that later murders his beloved uncle, he learns a tragic yet valuable lesson: ""With great power comes great responsibility."" Peter then vows to never let what happened to his Uncle Ben happen to anyone else & becomes Spider-Man!""Spider-Man"", unlike many comic to film adaptations, succeeds in revealing the true essence of the man behind the hero's mask. It also grabs the heart of its audience by presenting Peter Parker as an ordinary person at heart as it captures his everyday struggles to live an ordinary life while protecting the streets of New York in the guise of this iconic hero. Toby Maguire is terrific as Peter, as he nails his nerdy yet charismatic charm as well as Spider-Man's confident personality & amazingly mirrors his phenomenal physique. Ultimately, ""Spider-Man"" delivers in its story telling, special effects, & well choreographed action sequences. Five stars, & two thumbs up.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

distasteful escapism,"I have a buddy who hates the back-stories in superhero movies, which he finds unsatisfying. True enough but that goes double for the conflict, the villain and the resolution of each new calamity, which are as predictable and shallow as video games.Within a year of watching people fall to their deaths from a collapsing World Trade Center, we're entertained by a movie which features Kirsten Dunst about to fall to her death from a damaged skyscraper. That's entertainment? No that's bad taste. You'd have to go back to Murder on the Orient Express and watch author Agatha Christie recycle the Lindbergh kidnapping to sell books after too short a passage of time, to see anything more cynical.Instead the correct means of channeling fear and unresolved feelings over 9/11 is to pester two kids who scared the dumber members of the culture with light-brights, featuring the Mooninintes.

When he is Peter Parker, he takes a serious approach, but once he is Spider-Man, man, he is super cool. The way that had his costume in this film was just wonderful, but the one thing that was missing was his web-shooters, but that was in the reboot.Willem Dafoe plays Norman Osborn and Green Goblin and he gives us a menacing, hilarious and serious villain who loves being evil and I will say, the costume is a bit stupid, but I like it though. It's not horrible, but it could have been worse, worse than George Clooney's Batman suit in Batman and Robin and that is for sure! The rest of the cast is just amazing. James Franco plays Harry Osborn and he does an amazing job. Rosemary Harris is sweet and was the perfect casting choice and he is just amazing and fantastic, as the grandmother and aunt of Peter Parker, Aunt May Parker and she does wonders.The late Cliff Robertson plays Uncle Ben and that was the best performance of his career. It was really amazing and fantastic to see him in that role, who would later be played by Martin Sheen, in the 2012 reboot.At last, but least, Kirsten Dunst plays the role of Mary Jane Watson and she gives an amazing performance in this film and her and Dunst won 2003 MTV Movie Award for Best Kiss and that kiss with them is one of my favorite moments in movies.The music by Danny Elfman is just amazing and fantastic. The theme is really amazing as hell and it is fantastic and so amazing. It was a really good musical score and I love his BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS musical scores and that was really fantastic.The visuals are amazing and the action sequences that I like the most are the fights between Spider-Man and Green Goblin and the fight choreography in those scenes were really well done and the dialogue in this movie is really wonderful and this script was written by David Koepp and he wrote a good script and this film is really amazing.Overall, SPIDER-MAN is a really amazing film and it is really fantastic and an amazing, spectacular, incredible, stunning and well done superhero film that does not get enough credit and it really gets a lot of things right and this was really fantastic and it is really amazing to see Spider-Man on the big screen.I could go for hours talking about how much I like this and talk about the action sequences, the dialogue, the effects, music, editing and the acting from the actors, but I know that IMDb has a word limit and I've got to keep this review short.Spider-Man is a really good and amazing comic book film and this will remain as one of my best superhero films of all time and one of my best superhero films on IMDb and it will not change.

Moreover, this film has become a dream-come-true to all Spiderman fans who have watched all the Spider-Man cartoon animation and played all the Spider-Man games. I also have to say that the producers made an excellent choice of making Tobey Maguire play Spider-Man, who really did a good job in his performance. ""Spider-Man"" didn't only entertain me when I first watched it, but it made me learn a very important life-lesson, which is ""With great power comes great responsibility."" This is something that could be applied to daily life in all aspects.

"Still a classic, iconic superhero, comic book film","This film is on the same level of comic book and superhero genre excellence and iconic status as its 2004 sequel. An energetic introduction to a game-changing trilogy and the classic Spider-Man live-action suit design. This has the same thrilling tone with some campiness thrown in (some of Green Goblin's scenes and dialogue, Peter Parker testing out his newfound skills and abilities). While this has an overall less serious tone than the sequel, the action fight sequences - particularly the bridge and abandoned building scenes - are just as epic and immersive to watch; the plot, visual effects, and story pacing are top notch. The casting is spot-on first rate. Tobey Maguire is a natural in his debut appearance as Spider-Man/Peter. Green Goblin is wickedly tricky and overall a fun but also menacing villain, and Willem Dafoe's performance does it justice. Kirsten Dunst is wonderful as Mary Jane Watson, I love the natural on-screen chemistry that develops between her and Tobey's Peter. The supporting cast performances are also equally splendid.

It's hard for me to tell you specifically why. When he and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) kissed, I got all warm and tingly inside. Now, in conclusion, I recommend this excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat action-packed ride that you'll want to see over and over again to all Tobey Maguire or Kirsten Dunst fans who haven't seen it.

Raimi Sets the Standard for Future Superhero Movies,"In 2002, the world was treated to the second big budget treatment of a Marvel comic book in the form of Spider-Man. Bryan Singer had opened the doors for major comic book adaptations two years prior with his adaptation of the X-Men, and he proved such movies could make major earnings in the box office. Well, along came a spider and proved just how true that was when Spider-Man grossed $403.7 million in the United States alone. The film introduces audiences to the origins of the hero, when Peter Parker is bitten by a genetically-altered spider and is given extraordinary abilities (i.e. web-slinging, wall-crawling, his ""spider-sense""). After the death of his uncle at the hands of a car-jacker, Peter becomes determined to prevent crime and evil forces from ruining the lives of others and his first real test arrives in the form of the Green Goblin.My favorite aspect of Sam Raimi's film is that it FELT like a true Spider-Man movie. While I did enjoy Singer's X-Men, it didn't have the same feel as the comics/cartoons. It was the X-Men, but it was Bryan Singer's X-Men. Watching Raimi's film, it feels as if it's ripped straight from the pages of the comics. It faithfully depicted all of it's characters with a couple exceptions; some liberties had to be taken to fit 40 years of comic book history into a 2 hour movie. Just as in the comics, Peter is troubled by having to juggle his life as a super-hero with his life as a normal person, and one of the lessons our hero learns over the course of the film is that he can't have both. Raimi also gives us some great character development on the part of the villain, Norman Osborn/the Green Goblin. He takes the time to build up the father/son relationship between Norman and his son, Peter's best friend Harry, which builds up for further stories in the future.In addition to having a fantastic filmmaker at the helm, the movie benefits from near perfect casting. Tobey Maguire is more than capable of pulling off the meek, nerdy Peter Parker as well as his web/one-liner slinging alter ego. Kirsten Dunst, while not overwhelming in her performance, was a great Mary Jane Watson and James Franco was a solid Harry Osborn. As I said, the casting was pretty much perfect across the board, right down to Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson as Peter's aunt and uncle. The best (and I know of many who agree with me) was Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn. Seriously, I can't think of another actor who pull off such eccentric, insane roles like this man. He WAS the Green Goblin and I couldn't see any other actor having stepped into that role.The movie contains plenty of action with seamless CGI inter-mixed into real-time stunts, and the story also contains a strong plot with more than enough heart to make this more than just an action flick. Aside from a few slow moments, there really isn't much to complain about with Sam Raimi's Spider-Man and I think he was the first to set the standards for what the comic fans should expect from big screen adaptations of their favorite heroes.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
don't forget to take your girlfriend along,"Seems like only two days ago I had the UNpleasure of watching the Scorpion King. I never went to see Blade II, although a friend of mine said it was good. I was waiting for Spider-man. Finally, yesterday, having left the ladies at home, me and my collegue (also a moviegoer and just like me not a very big fan of Spidey) went to the theatre with two tickets and a big bag of popcorn.Let me take you along...For five minutes I had to sit and chew popcorn watching the credits... boring, but reminds you the 80s, when many movies began this way. And what? We all loved that movies, because of what followed, of course.What followed was the story of a boy who.. you know;) By the way, this was the first time I saw Tobby Maguire. Meant for this role. Willem Dafo's Green Goblin definetely wasn't bad, at those short moments he wore no mask, he gave a very good performance of a person, struggling with himself - man, everyone in the theatre was laughing. But do we have to take this movie or its good/bad guys seriously? I guess, those of us, who will or have tried to, are the ones dissapointed.Now we come to the lady. In a movie, which is a comic adaptation, there MUST BE romance. Judge yourself, it's difficult to create a good plot, so it is substituted with CGI, them come more CGI and then the movie's over (see for Batman&Robin). Probably mindful of it, they gave Mary Jane a lot of appearances. With or without our hero. I bet many of you remember how she said she had to go to the actor's school. I just wonder how many of you would agree with me that she really should...However, the scene in the rain was wonderful - or am I too romantic? Pity, but the lady didn't see that one. The CGI were terrific, should I tell you that? Guess I'll see it again.. 8/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Some Parts Don't Hold Up Today But Still A Good Introduction to Spider-Man,"Geeky science-wiz and High School student, Peter Parker, was bitten by a radioactive spider while on a field trip and developed spider like powers which allows him to climb up walls, shoot a web and swing on it and super strength. At first he uses these powers for his own gain but when his Uncle Ben is murdered in cold blood by a thief Peter decides to use his powers for the benefit of New York City. As his Uncle Ben said, ""With great power comes great responsibility.""While this is going on, Norman Osborn the head of OsCorp has taken a super serum and has gained super strength and a twisted alter ego. He dons a glider and body armor to become The Green Goblin and begins terrorizing the city. He has made it his personal goal to get Spider-Man to join him on his personal crusade against order. Spider-Man has to balance being fresh out of High School, his relationships with his friends and Aunt, and stop Goblin from hurting innocent people.The plot is what you'd come to expect for an origin story but some parts of the film when looked at today are considerably dated. Most of the CGI while impressive for its time looks very fake when compared to the effects we're used to today. Even back then they looked a tad off. For instance scenes where the Goblin is flying on his glider or when Spider- Man is climbing a wall or jumping off something are pretty obviously CGI. It doesn't take you out of the feel for the movie per se but it looks a little jarring.What might take you out of the moment is some of the dialog. Comics in their day had some pretty corny dialog but recently movies have been averting the corny dialog. And even though this movie was one of the first superhero films to revive the genre some of the dialog feels very forced. The scenes with Peter and Mary Jane (his love interest) are sometimes good but other times they feel awkward and that's probably what they're going for since Peter is supposed to be awkward but when he's Spider-Man it still feels a bit awkward. The Goblin's dialog is like it was taken out of the Adam West Batman TV Show. That isn't terrible in fact it's actually really enjoyable but if we're trying to take him seriously as a threat his dialog has to have a little more threatening tone to it.But the film still holds up on the emotional side of Spider-Man. The scene where Uncle Ben is killed is still sad and the relationship Peter has with his friends and Aunt May are performed very well. It's just the dialog that makes it feel a little forced. And the fight scenes are still engaging and filled with energy.The cast pull their characters off as if they were made for the parts. Tobey Maquire does a good balancing act as Spidey and Peter Parker keeping Spidey's sarcastic sense of humor and Peter's nerdy behavior. Kirsten Dunst plays a decent Mary Jane, James Franco pulls Harry Osborn's relationship with his father very realistically, and Willem Dafoe is in my opinion the best actor they could've picked for Goblin and Norman. The one that stands out as the best though is J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jamerson. There is no doubt about it he is the perfect Jamerson. His quick humor and motor mouth fit the character to a t, and I can't think of anything bad to say about his performance.So while the film has a lot of flaws it's still a fun movie to watch. It's a nice introduction to Spider-Man if you've never heard of the character(surprisingly enough) and a good film on its own.I give Spider-Man a 7.5 leaning to an 8.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good but could have been better!,"Good action sci-fi PG-13 movie that uses CGI effects very well to depict the famous superhero.Above average cinematography and directing.The screenplay was average and the script was below average.The movie banked too heavily on the heroes great costume and the outstanding special effects although for some reason,slacked off on the quality acting and depth.Due to this slacking off factor,comic book fans who expect a quality level as high as SUPERMAN (1979) will be let down.Do watch this one with an average movie expectation and it will deliver!Only for big action sci-fi fans and big fans of Web head.My major complaints are:1)actress who portrayed Mary Jane does not look like Mary Jane or even has the persona of the Mary Jane I know in the comic books 2)High School scenes are very un High School looking and comes off as cheap as a porno movie 3)the love story was very weak and intellectually insulting to the more smarter audience 4)Parker in the comic books was a very good scientist who acted nerdy but was a much better looking guy than the movie version Parker 5)Spidey has WEB SHOOTERS and does not create his own natural webbing 6)Uncle Ben actor was not good 7)the scene where Parker is bitten by Spider is weak 8)the movie music is weak 9)Green Goblin in movie is not Green Goblin I know 10)where is Gwen Stacy! 11)Bugle Building is not shaped like that! 12)Spidey is much funnier than was shown here 13)Goblin's/Defoe's lines were too shalow 14)non focus on Parker's scientific genius side makes his creation of Spidey's incredible costume weakThe movie got the very technical hard parts very well (Spidey costume,Spidey special effect movements,Spidey webbing,Goblin lanterns and hover craft,action sequences) but for some weird reason,was just plain careless with stuff that are sooooooo easy to deal with.The result is instead of a MASTERPIECE that could have been on par with SUPERMAN (1979) or STAR WARS (1977),we end up with a good summer popcorn movie that will collect dust as soon as the next good popcorn movie hype comes along.A masterpiece saga like SPIDER MAN deserves much more than that,even more so now that the CGI effects are here to do it right......",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's like watching a live action comic book,"There have been mixed results for comic books turned into movies but Spiderman is one that definitely delivers. There is a lot to admire about this film. The cinematography from Don Burgess is stunning, credit also has to go to the editing and (despite my doubts) Tobey Maguire is brillliant as Peter Parker AND Spiderman.However, this movie was far from perfect. While Kirsten Dunst put in a solid performance as Mary Jane Watson she was nothing more than fodder for Spiderman's heroics. In this day and age it's a bit disheartening to see this `damsel in distress' tactic still at the forefront of mainstream Hollywood. Also the rescue sequence bore a strong resemblence to the payoff in `Batman Forever'.One area that I think will cause much debate between movie fans is the way the dialogue was used. Instead of going down the route of attempting sharp witticisms (something used to disastrous effect in `Batman and Robin' and `Blade 2') the dialogue was similiar to what you would read in one of the Spiderman comic books. While this will thrill `Spidey's' original fans it may become irritating to fans of movies who are looking for a solid screenplay.All in all, a good effort to the comic book/movie fraternity. While I look forward a lot more to `X-2', Spiderman was still a great deal better than Star Wars.P.S: At the end of the movie Spiderman is on a New York skyscraper with an oversized American flag in the background. I suspect that this was a scene added at the last minute because the scene involving the World Trade Centre was cut because of the September 11th attack. Fair enough, it was a terrible occurance but, as I am English, I can guarantee that it was a major turn-off for viewers not in America. But as the film has smashed box-office records, I don't think the distributors will care much anyway.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A lot of fun and a good film to watch.,"SPIDER-MANThis is the original Sam Raimi version.The movie is about a school student and photographer who gets bitten by a spider and develops special powers like a spider. His nemesis in this is the Green Goblin.I like this film I know the Sam Raimi version got slated by a lot of people, but the films were a lot of fun. The feel of this film is very comic book. But that is what I like about it. I felt that with the latest Batman trilogy they took the comic feel away from it and made it into a very dark, realistic feeling movie I loved it, but I still preferred the Tim Burton version of Batman because it still had the comic book feel.The effects are not too bad, but at time you can tell that there are a lot of computer generated moments, especially when Peter is sunning along the roof tops.The casting was quite good, but I thought there were some lines and scenes where they delivered the lines so badly. Especially MJs facial expressions at times I have to admit, I did laugh at it. Tobey Maguire plays Peter Parker/Spider-Man. He does a great job. I think he is a good actor, but haven't really seen him in much else. Kirsten Dunst plays MJ. Kirsten is a very good actress, but this is not her best work. She has times where she is very convincing, but other times she was quite bad. James Franco plays Peters best friend, Harry. James has grown in leaps and bounds he was good in this film. I understand completely why he is as big now as he is. The Green Goblin is played by Willem Defoe... he is an excellent choice for this role. He has the perfect facial expressions for the part and does a brilliant creepy performance. I also really like the cameo appearances from some famous faces Stan Lee, WWF Superstar, the late great Macho Man Randy Savage and the legend that is Bruce Campbell.There were parts of this movie that I thought were ridiculous. It just didn't make sense. Peter gets bitten by a spider, it swells up so badly and he feels really ill so instead of going to the doctor or hospital he goes home to bed? Really? No-one would ever do this! I also thought it was really funny how MJ was so confused all the way through the movie she was so immature for her age. She starts the movie by dating the school meathead, then starts dating Harry, then she has a school girl crush on Spider-Man and then ends the movie telling Peter that she loves him Blimey, get a grip woman! It seems that she has no clue as to what love is.This film is a great movie which I will watch again and again. Sam Raimi has done a good job with it and I love the way the whole film feels. A nice little finishing touch was right at the end of the credits you get to hear the classic Spider-Man theme tune! Awesome!I will give this film 7 out of 10.""With great power, comes great responsibility""",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A bit of a letdown...,"Spider-Man is a fun movie, but it's just a little too contrived (even for comic book material).It's an interesting take on the original story in regards to the script and direction. And I thought Willem Dafoe and Toby Maguire did a good job given the somewhat cheesy material. A few fun cameos also appear such as Randy Savage, Bruce Cambell, Lucy Lawless and Stan Lee.This isn't the best comic book movie ever made, but it's definitely not the worst. The main thing that takes away from the movie is that it can be pretty unrealistic (yes, even taking into consideration that it's a comic book movie).

Above average but only slightly,"Spiderman started off pretty well & had the makings of a good film but too much time was devoted to the romance as the film went on.I'd have liked a little more insight into Peter at the start before the biting but more than that, the start of Peters' / Spidermans' mission to help the public was glossed over far too quickly. One minute he was looking at the costume, within seconds it was days later & the city all knew about him. I'd have liked Spiderman to have been a little more comic book style like Superman, but nonetheless it's still a good film with some great scenes (and gaffes).A low 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The casting choices were excellent. I would say a well directed movie.Now back to the story, Innocent and Weak Peter parker is bitten by a Radio Active Spider and he is transformed in to Spiderman.

The best,Simply the best version of any Spider-Man film. Fantastic story with great special effects at the time. The joy of seeing Spidy swing around NYC is what really is the best bit of the film. This is the problem with the latest films. He's not in NYC. Why nothing doing a Spider-Man film if he's not in NYC.None of the recent films are as good as this or the original trilogy. They are poor versions of a poor Spider-Man film where he is a poor cameo character in the Marvel universe.

Am I the only one?,"Who find this to be the most painful moviegoing experience in recent memory? I don't think I found one redeeming piece of filmmaking in this overproduced piece of garbage and it was just torturous to watch. Do I have to be a Spider-man fan to get what all the buzz is about? I doubt it because I had only seen the hackney, corny 60s Batman before the movie came out and that was a great piece of work.Comnparisons to Batman aside this movie cannot stand alone on its own two feet. This film is two-hours of anti-climax without an interesting or even developed character in the lot of them. While Tobey McGuire is a decent actor he's always had a boring screen persona, in fact, I couldn't find a vibrant personality in this film to liven it up.David Koepp, who has written or co-written some exciting films such as Jurassic Park and Panic Room couldn't have come up with a more boring and I'm guessing faithful storyline. There wasn't anything to punch it up or make it more lively. Of course, a slow paced story can be made more interesting and Sam Raimi is also largely to blame even though he's made some great movies in the past this most certainly is not one of them.Even if the story was designed with cliches in the comic book couldn't they have been avoided? I won't even go into them but they're all over the place. Willem DeFoe is also boring and the fights are lame and contrived and there wasn't an original or even a clever move in any of them. It goes without saying the special effects were awful and they go hand in hand with the trite motionless storyline. I don't think I've seen a worse studio film in six years. I didn't have to stand in line to see this one and I sure as hell won't be standing in line to see the next one.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Don't tell Harry, but Spider-Man was AMAZING!","Believe it or not, I was actually looking forward to Spider-Man. A lot. I'll admit, I'm certainly not a comic book person, but the cartoon was brilliant. Since all this hype about Spider-Man began, I had to go out and buy a huge hardback book documenting just about every major storyline that was ever featured in the comic books.Before I went to the film, I knew it'd be good. How could it not be? Surely just having Spider-Man in it would be enough. There's something about him that makes him the coolest super hero (by far). Maybe it's because he's young, different, interesting. Look at Super Man. Boring job, boring life. And how he has the cheek to think a pair of glasses is somehow a 'brilliant' disguise, I'll never know. At least Spider-Man has the decency to cover up a bit.Going in already expecting it to be fantastic could be a problem. I was a little concerned that I'd think it was good when it really wasn't. Although I don't think that was a problem, in the end. A lot of hype, yes - but not over-rated (unlike 'Bored' of the Rings).So, for anyone who's been living in a cave all their life, here's a brief outline of the story. Peter Parker is in his senior year of high school, and is a bit of a science whiz. He has a deep crush on his next-door neighbour, Mary-Jane Watson, and his best friend is Harry Osborn, whose father owns Oscorp Industries. He lives with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May, who are a couple in their late sixties (although it's not mentioned in the film, Peter Parker's parents were apparently killed when he was very young). Peter is often ridiculed at school and people regard him as a bit of a nerd. One day, on a science trip, Peter is bitten by a genetically modified spider. The next day he finds the spider has given him 'Spider Powers' including the ability to scale walls, shoot webs and detect danger with his 'spider sense'. While this is going on, Norman Osborn, owner of Oscorp Industries, is conducting a test on himself to show his chemicals work successfully. However, exposing himself to these chemicals turns him into the evil Green Goblin...The storyline itself is very different and new. Although the storyline has existed for years, what Raimi, Lee et al did with it created a pretty decent film. The camera work was fantastic, which ranged from over-head action shots to intense emotional close-ups. The special effects were flawless. Particularly when the Green Goblin gatecrashed the Oscorp Unity Fair, the scenes of Spider-Man and the Green Goblin battling were incredibly realistic. You could tell a lot of the conventions had been drawn from recent films, such as The Matrix. However, this film itself has set a lot of conventions. Sam Raimi was an excellent choice for the director of this film. He managed to take small, insignificant actions, and turn them into the most memorable scenes in the film. The blood drip from Spider-Man's fight wound is just so inventive and the camera work and special effects make that scene so suspenseful and intense. 'Spider-Man' creates a wide range of emotions - sometimes you'll be staring open-mouthed and engrossed at the action, and other times your heart will be breaking at the grief.Before I went to see this film, I was warned about Tobey Maguire's role of Spider-Man. After seeing it, I can't understand what everyone was complaining about - I honestly can't think of anyone better to play Spider-Man. They needed someone fairly unknown to play Spider-Man, so that they could develop his character from a clean slate. He had the perfect 'nerdy' look at the start (I was a little worried it'd be a typical case of the actor who only needs to remove his glasses in order to be considered attractive...), and definitely stood out next to all the other male characters in the film. Very suited to the role. He even managed to pull off those classic Spider-Man wisecracks. Look out for the ""Nice costume - did your husband buy it for you?"" when he's wrestling with Bonesaw McGraw. Unfortunately, these wisecracks become a lot more sparse as the film becomes more serious.As for Kirsten Dunst, I think she did well, but I was a little unhappy about Mary-Jane's character (see below). Her performance did seem genuine and believable, and luckily, the red hair dye didn't look too fake...Star role was Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin. He suited the role perfectly, and was easily flitted between the good guy and the bad guy. I also liked J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, but it would've been nice to see a little more of him in this role.For any die-hard comic book fans, the question might be how true did the film stay to the old comic books? Okay, so I'm not a die hard fan, and probably have no place to comment, although I did read the hard back book from cover to cover, and have familiarised myself with the storylines a little. Obviously it would be impossible to stick to the exact storylines that evolved in the comic books. This didn't create too much of a problem, except that there wasn't much room for Spider-Man to develop. In the comic books, there were a few editions of him discovering his powers, fighting a few petty criminals, etc, before he moved onto fighting the big ones. There's no way the film could digress for half of it, before finally introducing the Green Goblin. It was a little cheesy and unconvincing that both Peter Parker and Norman Osborn happened to transform at the same time, as well. However, I think it was generally handled well.Everyone should know that Spider-Man does not actually have the ability to shoot webs, but in the film he does. I can't really say why this is, but I get the feeling that his character is slightly different to the Spider-Man in the comic books. Once Peter Parker left high school, he never seemed to mention science much anymore. I think perhaps they were trying to give him a 'cooler' image, and breakaway from this 'nerd' persona. If Peter Parker had had the knowledge to actually create this webbing fluid, it might have given him a less of a 'cool' and 'macho' image.I also have to say that I wasn't too impressed with Mary-Jane in this film. In the cartoon and comic book, she was far more forward and confident. In the film she seemed a little more insecure and subdued, despite being popular. Kirsten Dunst did say ""Tiger"" on one or two occasions, but it didn't really look right coming from her character. I was more expecting her to say lines like ""Let's face it Tiger, you just hit the jackpot!"", giving her a cheeky, almost arguably arrogant character. She was quite different in the film.There were a few other points too, like the way in which Spider-Man and the Green Goblin were created - these processes seemed to be changed slightly to make it more modern, and realistic. Well all know too that Uncle Ben was killed by a burglar - the film modernises this to a car-jacking. And, if I'm right, wasn't it Mary-Jane's Aunt Anna, who lived next door to Peter's Aunt May? Yet, in the film, it was Mary-Jane herself who lived next door to Peter. And it was Aunt May and Aunt Anna who set them up on a blind date, rather than Peter secretly carrying a torch for Mary-Jane.Nevertheless, I feel that creating a film which matched the comic books exactly was quite a tall order. Some parts of the film suffered, because it was hard to cover all the important aspects of Peter's life in two hours. However, I cannot imagine this task being approached any better way. It might've been better if it was a little longer, as, at times, it felt a little rushed. I must say though - a truly fantastic film, full of surprises and excitement. Don't wait for it to come out on DVD - it was an amazing experience watching it on the big screen, and you'll be thoroughly thrilled from start to finish.The ending was absolutely amazing. I won't give anything away, but it was left very much wide open, and was very unexpected - in more ways than you might think! It's fairly obvious they'd always planned to make a 'Spider-Man 2' as well, so I can only hope the sequel is just as good.One thing's for sure: it was waaaaaaay better than Batman...",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Spider-Man learns to crawl, but only later does he learn to fly!","Sam Raimi's Spider-Man is full of energy, zipping and zooming across the screen with gleefully wild delight. The former Evil Dead creator's visual style for quick zooms and he's zany sense of humor is present throughout the film, but Raimi has also brought along his heart and passion for the comic book to his film. The film was written by David Keopp, fresh after writing David Fincher's Panic Room, and his script gets a few things right and a few things not so right, but in the end this is a pretty amusing and exciting sci-fi/adventure that's sure to keep you entertained.The cast of Spider-Man does a quite a good job, but I'll be honest when I first heard that Toby Maguire was going to be playing the role of Spider-Man I thought to myself, ""Who? That nerdy kid from Pleasantville?"", so obviously I had my doubts as to if he was up to the task of pulling off the part of Peter Parker and Spider-Man. Why Maguire is perfectly suited for the role of Spider-Man is because he can easily pull of the nerdy/boy-next-door look that is required for Peter Parker. Another good job in casting was getting Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn aka ""The Green Goblin"". Dafoe goes all Nicholson on us, and doesn't hold anything back; he's in full-on snarl and growl mode, and his voice and mannerisms fit well with the character he's playing. I particularly enjoyed the scene where he talks to himself in the mirror, showing his multiple personalities, a scene that's gone somewhat similar in Peter Jackson's The Two Towers.The special effects on the other hand aren't quite as flawless as the casting, but for the majority of the film they do work to one degree or another. In the scene where Parker discovers his powers and jumps along the roof tops it's pretty obvious that's a computer effect, but watching Spider-Man battle the Green Goblin on the Queensboro Bridge in the film's finale is quite something. The shots that seemed to take my breath away the most were the dramatic shots of Spider-Man swinging his way all around Manhattan and the cinematography by Don Burgess really helps add to the vibrant look of the film, which is very cool.However, there are a few little things and one big thing I didn't like about Spider-Man. First off, the little things. Personally I think Mary Jane looked a little ""skanky"" in the beginning of the movie. Was I the only one that thought that? Secondly, I wasn't surprised that Peter Parker lived with his Aunt and Uncle, but it certainly would have been nice to know exactly why that was. Then there's the overindulgent Macy Gray cameo that was completely pointless. And lastly, and most importantly I really didn't like how they decided to do the Green Goblin. If you've read the comic book series Ultimate Spider-Man by Brian Michael Bendis the Green Goblin was created by Norman Osborn injecting himself with a green plasma in a syringe, and then psychically and literally turning into a green monster, which looked much more menacing than the space suite and helmet they ended up using the film. I thought that was a really, really bad choice, because of two reasons. One, it seemed a little strange that the Military would actual end up wearing a goofy looking helmet like that, and two, it just wasn't dark enough for me. But put aside those few complaints I think the film is still pretty good, but it could have been a little better. As for right now I'm giving this film a score of a seven, it's a pretty good film, with a good cast and some fun action sequences that's also able to get us involved with the characters and enjoy them on a small emotional level, so for those reasons it is a success, but it certainly could have used a little tweaking here and there.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A silver-age comic book come to life!,"I know that many people were dissatisfied with Sam Raimi's first two Spider-Man films. I'm sure most of them were expecting something with a dark/harder edge to it, rather than the lighthearted, action-adventure film that was presented. I know because upon seeing the film for the first time, I felt the exact same way. You see, I grew up with the 90's animated series which had a bit of a darker take on the character of Spider-Man. At first I regarded the film as ""good"" but not ""GREAT"" or ""FANTASTIC"" because it wasn't what I was expecting. Now however, after many years, (and two God-awful reboot films!) I find the film to be excellent! I finally understand the director's intention for this film, and I've read a bunch of the original silver-age comics, to which the the film is based on. In my opinion, this film succeeds on all levels! The main plot of the film is based on Spider-Man's origin story (From Amazing Fantasy 15) and the climax of the film is partially based on Amazing Spider-Man #121. a.k.a (The night Gwen Stacey died) Although, some changes were made. The story, characters, and look of the film work extremely well. All of the actors were excellent! They fully understood the core of their characters, and made them come alive. Many people have complained about the silly lines of dialogue, and the corny jokes said by certain characters in the film. I no longer have a problem with this, and here's why: In the original 60's comics, there were silly lines and corny jokes, but that was all part of their charm, and atmosphere. Which is what this movie beautifully re-creates, the charm and atmosphere of the original 60's and 70's Spider-Man comics. I liked this movie back in the summer of '02, but now I LOVE it! Sam Raimi has made the two best Spider-Man films of all time, and I don't think anyone will ever come remotely close to topping them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
So bad I don't know where to begin.,"This movie is awful. I walked out of this film felling like I was lobotomized. My jaw was dropped and I couldn't utter a word. I went in expecting a good movie. I mean it's Spider-Man for crying out loud. But the hack job that is this movie just blew my mind. Why would the director make this movie like this. Did he have to inject so many campy, comic book traits into the film. It just made the movie silly. I felt like I was watching the 60's Batman TV show except it's about Spider-man and it's updated with 21st century sets and special effects. This film should be a lessen in how not to do a superhero movie. Stay away from this movie.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What do you want?!  Shawshank 2!,"Because when I look at various comments on these pages regarding this film, and other blockbusters, I feel that this is what people want in every film they see and I don't know why. When I go to see a drama I see a drama, when I want to see a comedy I see a comedy, why does every film have to be ""The Godfather"" otherwise it's badly acted and scripted?The only films that tend to buck this trend are superhero films that have character actors as their lead. The truth is that this is a really good blockbuster film.The story revolves around Peter Parker and his conversion from nerdy college kid to crime fighting superhero, at the same time as his nemesis, the evil Green Goblin, is spawned from his best friend's father Norman Osborn, and whilst Peter is Spider-Man, Norman's persona splits, tearing into the quiet and benign Norman, who eventually becomes the bullied victim of the controlling and evil Green Goblin.Like most good adaptations it stays pretty close to its source material and, in some areas, improves on them. The cast are are excellent in their respective roles with particular plaudits going to Willem Dafoe whose switches from Goblin to Norman are so perfect that you are never left in doubt who is who as his persona becomes more fractured. Cliff Robertson and JK Simmons are equally good as inspirational Uncle Ben and Uninspirational J. Jonah Jameson respectively.The action set pieces are all handled supremely well and even though some of the effects aren't brilliant, because of the overall strength of the film it matters little as the characters and story keep your interest so much that it doesn't matter if some of the effects aren't up to the standard of other blockbusters with less charm, plot and characters.A great start to the spider-man series.

"In a word, iconic. Stands the test of time and looking back it's Time to rectify certain iniquities with this review","Sometimes a passage of time, a maturity can change the way you look at things.I was as big a Spider-man kid as anyone growing up, relating to Peter Parker and Ben Reilly as much as anyone, so I liked the film fine, i was just ecstatic to finally have a Spider-man film, although i didnt absolutely love it when it came out.Rewatching the film now I see how good it is. There are so many classic lines, the number of memes from this film are insane and blow out nearly all of the always enjoyable but sometimes forgettable Marvel films out of the water.Rewatching the film I can just see how well made it is. The film isn't a frantic blink and you'll miss it pace for today's audience but is always building. Every scene and line progresses the story, no line is wasted, funny when needs to be only. Sam Raimi bringing in his horror chops really works here to make the Goblin terrifying and fill the film with a growing sense of tension.As a fan there are a lot of callbacks that I appreciate. The acting is good across the board, Tobey Maguire is still seen as Spider-man and his Peter Parker is undoubtedlythe best, Kristen Dunst is a bombshell as Mary Jane (even if a natural blonde!) and Dafoe as Norman Osborn/the Green Goblin, I thought it was ridiculous at the time but once again the performance has stood the test of time and is iconic, so that says it all.Not to mention true Morality, a great setting and none of the wokey nonsense Marvel puts in films these days.

It is of impeccable quality. Thanks to ""Spider-Man"" Tobey McGuire probably finds the role of his life. At last a role at the extent of his talent. Besides him, Kirsten Dunst has such an appealing charm that it is difficult to resist her. Willem Dafoe is just amazing in his role of wicked.

The first well done Spider-Man.,"Any movie before 2002 about the famous web crawler is not even worth watching. I've tried.The Sam Raimi Trilogy was absolutely incredible for its time! I grew up on these as a kid and was obsessed!! Why for its time? Well, after we've seen so many variations of the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man come to live action.. then in comparison the CGI doesn't and couldn't live up to the new ones at all. Obvious statements aside,
This is the real OG Spidey film in my opinion.Watch the entire trilogy with your friends or family. It's really well done.If you don't know Spider-Man, this is not a bad place to start at all. I rewatched all the movies as an adult and they're still great.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Pretty good superhero movie.,"I have not read the Spider-Man comics and don't know the character's story or origin, so this movie was the first introduction for me to the superhero. After watching it, even to somebody completely new to the comic book character, it was a pretty good and entertaining movie. Tobey Maguire stars as the nerdy and shy high schooler Peter Parker, who was bitten by a genetically modified spider, turning him into a more muscular and confident man with spider-like abilities that he must use to fight evil and the villainous Green Goblin, all while experiencing a tragedy in his family. Along the way, he attempts to court his high school crush, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).The acting was descent, albeit a little wooden at times, but I think it helped enhance the steady-going plot story. The special effects were neat and there are plenty of action to keep the story entertaining and exciting. I like the movie's motto, ""With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility!"" I think that message couldn't have resonate with a better character like Peter Parker since has to rise to the occasion after experiencing the rough side of high school, tragedy and competition with his more popular and well-off friend Harry Osborn (James Franco).Overall, an entertaining movie which I think is the best of the three made starring Maguire.Grade B+",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Poor Casting,"I have been reading Spiderman ever since i knew how to read, and i would say i know the comic well. That being said i have never seen a movie so poorly cast. Peter Parker is supposed to be nerdy, but also an in-shape, somewhat with it New Yorker. His nerd side is supposed to be there, but he gains a lot of confidence after becoming Spiderman. He is also supposed to be WITTY and make clever and funny remarks all the time, but most notably during fight scenes. By eliminating this aspect they made Spiderman and Peter Parker an extremely flat character. I can't even say anything about Mary Jane, there are no words to describe how horrific she is in these movies, it is an ultimate disaster.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A spectacular Origin Story,"This film is so so important not only to me but for the Superhero Genre overall, this was revolutionary, The cast, the music, the cinematography were so brilliant, Tobey Maguire in this film shows he can play both parts as Peter and Spider-Man he leans more of the better Peter than Spider-man but his Spider-Man on screen is very heroic even going as far to rescue a trapped baby in the building, saving the city etc, Willem Defoe's green goblin is one of the most intimidating and frightening villains to appear on screen, he was born to play him, Willem Defoe give's us a perfect demonstration of a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde persona, Dr Jekyll being Norman and Mr Hyde being the Goblin, in this film we see his struggle of trying to live a normal healthy life but then being corrupted by The Goblin, he threatens lifes just for the sake of it, he has no motivation, The goblin manipulates Norman into helping him to this crazy villainous schemes, Mary Jane in this film is a perfect love interest in this film to Peter and helpful for him in times of need and Peter does the same for her, Aunt May in this film is personally my favourite Aunt May, she has words of wisdom for Peter, and Peter looks up to her same as uncle ben, cliff played an amazing Uncle Ben and probably the most classic Uncle Ben in the entire Spider-Man Media, The score in this film is fantastic Danny Eflman made a tear dropping and gives us goosebumps when we hear his iconic Spider-Man theme, The CGI here is a bit outdated and doesn't age well but we have to know that this film was made back in 2002, overall this film is a spectacular Origin for what's about to come next.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but not perfect","This was a great movie.  I remember seeing it a couple of times in theaters and telling everyone to go see it.  The story is great-I thought the twist in the beginning was great where Peter Parker learns that ignoring his responsibility (with great power comes great responsibility) causes grief in his personal life.  I hear that this is similar to what happened to him in the comics as well, but I wouldn't know, having never read the comic.  I also loved the action scenes.  I understand that a lot of CGI was used, but I have no idea where it was used.  It's all transparent to me, so I think they did a pretty convincing job.  I'm glad that the action was fast and they didn't recycle that slow-motion action that was first seen in the matrix.  Watching someone leap in the air, have the camera stop, and pan is now a trick that has outstayed its welcome.  Fast action conveys a sense of urgency and excitement and is suits this movie.There are a few strikes against this movie.  One thing I wasn't crazy about was the sugar-coated feel of it.  There are a number of scenes that feel like they were tweaked to lure in the teenaged girls.  I found myself cringing at some scenes that were a little cheesy and I didn't feel that happening in some of the other, more recent superhero movies.  It doesn't reach the heights of cheesyness that Titanic does, but I would have liked a more serious spiderman.  It doesn't have to be as serious as the Hulk or Daredevil, but maybe something in between would feel right.  I would also like a more interesting villain, with a real motive for his behavior.  The costume was a little silly too...I just wasn't afraid of him.  A good villain should instill fear in your heart.  Maybe these issue will be addressed in Spiderman 2.I'd give this movie a 10 and subtract a point for some of the dialog and the power-ranger outfit of the goblin.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Superb adaptation;  has a lot of parallels with Smallville,"Sam Raimi's Spider-man has a lot of parallels with Alfred Gough's and Miles Millar's Smallville television series which chronicles the adventures of a young Clark Kent. Both Peter and Clark are high school students struggling to fit in. Both have a love interest that seems out of reach; Mary Jane for Peter and Lana Lang for Clark. Both budding superheroes come from modest households and yet also have warm and caring adoptive families. Both of them have rich best friends who flirt with the darker side of human nature; Harry Osborn and Lex Luthor. Eventually both their best friends will become their nemeses. And the fathers of their best friends, Norman Osborn and Lionel Luthor, both extend genuine fatherly admiration for Peter and Clark respectively.As for the movie itself, Spider-man is an excellent translation of comic book to silver screen. Along the way there were some liberties taken, like the fact that Peter's ability to shoot webs is another result of the genetically modified spider's bite rather than his manufacturing of web shooters as was shown in the comics, but all in all the spirit of the source material is maintained. The action sequences and CGI were thrilling upon first viewing in the cinema and they hold up fairly well today although it has to be remembered that technology pushes ever forward. But the action scenes are only a secondary pleasure of the film. The primary pleasure is in watching the relationship between the characters unfurl. At the risk of sounding like a sap, I thought Tobey and Kirsten did a marvelous job in showing how young Shakesperean romantic love develops. I truly felt the euphoria that such an emotion generates. To use a cliché, the two had great chemistry. The warmth and caring of the Parker household was also very touching and the tragedy of Ben Parker's demise, frankly, gets to me every time. To me, however, the most intriguing relationships are the ones between Harry and Norman and Harry and Peter. The viewer can empathize with Harry's yearning for love and recognition from the senior Osborn and the jealousy he must feel at his father's interest in Peter. The scene where Harry concedes that his father was 'right about M.J., right about everything' and Norman admits that he 'hasn't always been there' for his son was played to great effect by James Franco and Willem Dafoe. The relationship between Peter and Harry is also a marvel (no pun intended) to watch unfold. We see their almost brotherly camaraderie at the field trip turn into understated awkwardness and tension over Harry's interest in Peter's girl. The mutual empathy over the parallel losses of their fathers briefly brings them together again until Harry swears a vendetta against Peter's alter ego meaning they are now enemies. Great stuff! I can't wait to see how this develops in further installments of the franchise. All the secondary characters are well cast also. Special mention must be made of Bonesaw (played by real life wrestler Randy 'Macho Man' Savage) and J. Jonah Jameson (played by J.K. Simmons who to a degree reprises his role as Sheriff Pearl Johnson in The Gift which not coincidentally was also directed by Raimi). If I have one minor quibble it would be that I wish that the Peter's first love from the comics, Gwen Stacy, could somehow have been written in. She is such a great character. Then again, to do so would probably dilute the Pete-M.J. story arc. The two-disc editions have a wealth of info and special features, more than enough to satisfy the most ravenous curiosity over the film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best in this franchise,"The first in the three Spider-Man movies starring Tobey Maguire is also the best in this franchise. A young and fresh-faced Maguire is the perfect basis for spinning the story of how Peter Parker stumbles across and then familiarizes himself with his superhero powers. For many, this is the most fun part in any superhero movie, and Sam Raimi and Maguire are undoubtedly enjoying themselves with it here. The film continues with a fine blend of simple, heartfelt drama (the relationship between Parker and his uncle/aunt), cute romance (Mary Jane), and good old-fashioned superhero action with Willem Dafoe in fine playful form.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Even tho this film is a little dated, it holds up great with other movies, even compared with the newest films out there.This is a great movie, it tells the story at a nice pace, and there is also something interesting to look at on screen, from the swooping camera angles, to the action and the love scenes.

You and I are not so different.,"Whilst out on a high school museum trip, student Peter Parker is bitten by a genetically enhanced spider. He suddenly finds himself with arachnid like super powers and goes on a crime fighting spree.With a budget of $100 million and a then up coming director in Sam Raimi in the chair, expectations for the first live action film of Spider-Man was extraordinarily high. Thankfully, Raimi and his team succeeded in producing a rip roaring spectacle that doesn't want for human based drama either. Back in 2002 Spider-Man was rightly being lauded as a film that appeased all comers, Raimi fans, comic book geeks and the walk in thrill seeking cinema crowd {the last one is a club i'm proudly a member of} all of which got catered for. Today, after two differing sequels, some of Spider-Man's shine appears to have dimmed, it's almost as if the franchise is judged as a whole, and not for this splendid, and very well crafted piece of fantasy. Which is a shame as Spider-Man doesn't rest on its comic book laurels, that would have been the easy option. Revisiting the film now in this post Dark Knight era, where darkly drawn undercurrents are all the rage, Raimi's Spider-Man is actually a leading light.Having Raimi in charge greatly benefits the piece, because where one could easily have dealt in full blown light entertainment, Raimi and screenwriter David Koep have flecked the fun with shades of dark. Comic book villainy gets a complex make over courtesy of Willem Dafoe's cackling Norman Osborne/Green Goblin splice off, with a mirror sequence fit to grace any head doctor seminar!. And Parker's duality {excellently realised by a well cast Tobey Maguire} alongside his own complex moral quandaries ensures that Spider-Man the movie is not just about bang for the buck shenanigans. Some minor problems do exist, the CGI at times comes off as creaky, and Danny Elfman's score is not up to his usual high standard, but in the main they are really only throw away complaints. To wit the odd quibble about Spider-Man origins and a hokey Green Goblin costume aside, the film is a sure fire winner. Kirsten Dunst eventually warms to the admittedly twee role of love interest Mary Jane Watson, and James Franco serves notice of undoubted ability as Peter Parker's best friend, Harry Osborne. With a humongous budget and a salivating fan base to please, Raimi was entrusted great responsibility. That he crafted such a ripper of a movie, with little shades of dark, is now, to my mind, a towering achievement. 8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A lot of fun,"A great adaptation of a comic book for the big screen.  The movie gives you a feel for Peter Parker's awkwardness as a teen, and the transformation he makes to become Spiderman.

Where you the viewer are in on the secret, and kind of hoping that M.J can figure it out.  The special effects were mostly great.  But, some of the scenes of Spiderman flying through the streets on his web looked a little fake.  But, did remind me a great deal of the animation from the comic books.I think fans of comic book style action adventure will find the movie to be a lot fun.I thought all of the acting performances were great.

"A Really Good, But Not Quite Great, Superhero Movie","Let me get this out of the way; I LOVE Spider-Man. Spider-Man has been my favorite superhero since I was 10 years old, mainly due to his extreme relatability and his sheer selflessness as a character. And, as you may have guessed, I do think the original Sam Raimi ""Spider- Man"" is a very, very good movie. That said, I don't think it's a GREAT movie. I don't think Marvel would give us any GREAT movies until 2003 when we got ""Daredevil"" and ""Ang Lee's Hulk"" (And I know that it's extremely controversial and perhaps unwise for me to say that, but that is my honest opinion), and while there IS a great movie buried deep in here, there are is one BIG problem that keeps it from being great.That problem is the romance. This film tries to make the romance the heart and soul of the movie, but when the two leads have so little chemistry and so little reason to truly be in love, you're in big trouble. Such is the case with Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker and Kristen Dunst's Mary Jane Watson. Mary Jane is a very unlikable character here to be perfectly honest; she's unsupportive, weak in her convictions and honestly seems to mess with Peter a fair amount, even if not intentionally. And of course, she is quite possibly the biggest damsel in distress in comic book movie history. She's not so much a character as a plot element inserted to help PETER develop. To be fair though, Peter isn't much better. Throughout the film I am completely stumped as to why he loved Mary Jane apart from her beauty. There is simply no other reason for him to be attracted to her, and it makes Peter seem very shallow romance wise.The effects are also EXTREMELY dated too. When I was watching Spider-Man swing across New York, I didn't feel like I was watching a real superhero. I felt like I was watching a cut scene from an Xbox 360 game.That said, if the romance had been executed better, this would truly be a great superhero movie. Apart from a mediocre Kristen Dunst (And her performance is NOT her fault. The script simply gave her nothing to work with), most of the acting is good. Tobey Maguire is fairly on and off. He perfectly captures the awkwardness and geekiness we know and love in Peter Parker, and he can really give us some true emotional depth in the more touching and tragic scenes of the movie, but he never really gives the alter-ego of Spider-Man much personality. And, of course, he has no chemistry with Kristen Dunst. I'd give his performance a B; not anything mind-blowing, but decent. Cliff Robertson, Rosemary Harris and Willem DaFoe are all fantastic in their roles; I can't imagine anybody more perfect for the roles of Uncle Ben, Aunt May and Green Goblin, it was like watching the comic book characters come to life. For a die-hard Spidey fan like me, it was a riot to watch them breathe so much life into these roles.Then of course, there's J.K Simmons as J.J Jameson...What can be said about this performance that hasn't already been said? At the end of the day, all I can tell you is this; there's a reason why Spider-Man fans want him to come back as J.J in the new ""Spider-Man"" films. Simmons alone was born to play this role.The pacing is some of the best I have ever seen in an action or superhero movie. There is not a single moment in ""Spider-Man"" where you will be bored or disinterested, it's very fast paced and does a perfect job of grabbing and holding onto your attention in both action and character development. Sure, Mary Jane doesn't really develop much beyond crushing on Peter, but Peter's transition from immature teenager to selfless guardian of New York is handled very well, and Norman Osborne's descent from well-intentioned scientist to schizophrenic madman is tragic, terrifying and captivating all at once. The action sequences are all spectacular, feeling extremely source to the source material in style and choreography without coming across as goofy or over the top.And lastly, the musical score. Danny Elfman's ""Spider-Man"" score is rousing, exciting and truly iconic to a Spidey fan like myself. It's impossible for me to listen too without smiling, and it really captures the tone of the movie and character perfectly.""Spider-Man"" is a really good movie, but I'm not quite willing to call it great. Yes, I do have only 2 criticisms of the movie, and only one major, but the fact remains that when the romance is the heart of your story, you damn well better make it work. And ""Spider-Man"" really, really doesn't. However, the movie get's nearly everything else right, from MOST of the character development, to the casting, to the action, to the score, to the pacing...Yeah, it's still a really good movie. I personally just don't think it was GREAT. Now the SEQUEL on the other hand...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Well cast-- Kirsten Dunst and Toby McGuire are very good. ""Batmanish"" overkill present, but kept to a minimum","How could anyone resist the charms of sweet little Kirsten Dunst? Although she's now 6-foot eight, and is 47 years old. No wait--- she's still young, and a delightful actor. Her dramatic work in ""Crazy/Beautiful,"" as well as her extensive and marvelous comedy work prior to that (""Drop Dead Gorgeous,"" and ""Dick"" are two under-appreciated modern classics)have proven her to be a major talent. She is definitely the Real Deal--- not just some poof-in-the-pan passing fad. In ""Spiderman"" she does the obligatory ""Oooing"" and ""aaahing"" at the hero--- but funnily, she also brings a realness to her role that goes beyond what previous comic-book-movie actresses have done. She brings an innocence and an excitement to her on-screen behaviors that is disarming and engaging for the audience. Yaay Kirsten!Toby McGuire is well matched for the role--- ""Spiderman"" comic have always been a bit on the underdog side. The movie is no exception. But I was very happy to see that this movie avoided (mostly) the bizarre and depressing ""dark side"" vibe that somehow seduced the makers of the tedious and self-absorbed ""Batman,"" the pretty good ""Mask,"" and even the horrid ""Monkey Bone"" (from an otherwise brilliant Brendan Fraser. What happened with THAT, dood?). Spidie's world seemed virtually normal, and the sci-fi overkill was only hinted at with Willem DeFoe's space-scooter thingy that could evidently run around the sky forever on a single, invisible, tank of gas.Over all, much more good hearted than previous movie-cartoons of comic books. WAY brighter, way better all around. Still not a masterpiece--- but entertaining enough.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Enjoyable movie for everyone,"First off, I want to say I'm a huge Star Wars fan and thought AOTC kicked butt.  That seems irrelevant, but with the ""war"" between Spider-man and Star Wars fans, it needed to be said.  Especially since I've never been a Spider-man fan or a fan of any other comic book hero.  The whole thing is new to me.  But I saw ""Spider-man"" and thought it was excellent.  It's not without flaws, but what movie isn't?The CG effects worked out well and weren't overused.  Some of them looked super cheesy in the previews, but you hardly notice them in the movie.  I'll never understand why so many people are against CG effects, especially with this movie and Attack of the Clones.  Sorry, but stringing up a 2-inch Spider-man model with a piece of dental floss isn't gonna cut it anymore. I'm amazed at what can be done in movies today and CG is the only way to achieve certain things.The characters were excellent, especially Tobey.  I had doubts about him playing such a physical character, but he really fit the role.  Kirsten did well with what she was given, but her character was the type who couldn't have saved herself from drowning in a puddle.  But this is comic book material and unfortunately, the women must be totally helpless.  Her character was the only one I didn't like.  Peter's aunt and uncle were very likeable, though.The story itself was very cool.  Not knowing a thing about Spider-man, it was great that I was able to understand the entire movie.  This is where it outshines Star Wars.  Anyone can watch ""Spider-man"" and fall in love with it, whereas first-time Star Wars viewers will get almost nothing out of AOTC.  My only personal complaint of ""Spider-man"" is that it has no repeat value, at least for me.  I saw it, liked it a lot, and that's it.  I've seen it once and that's all I need.

Not the best Spider-Man but great movie,"The one where it all started and probably your introduction to Spider-Man itself. Which explains why people like Tobey Maguire since he imo is an absolute miscast. Sure he has his moments but I just don't see him anywhere near as charismatic as the character is supposed to be. He does a decent Peter but it just doesn't work for me.With the negative out of the way its a very good origin movie, feels dated ofcourse but for a superhero movie in the 2000s it still holds up fantastically. Excellent overall casting and good performance from everyone involved. Even tho it fails to do justice to the character it does portray everything else perfectly. Great music, decent script and has all the right punches a superhero movie is supposed to have. A solid movie no matter the viewer but the main character gets outshined by majority of the cast.

"skip the high tech, how bout dunst in the rain","Greetings again from the darkness.  Disagreeing with the masses ($114 million opening weekend), I say this was quite the disappointment.  It is a little confusing to note that there is a decided lack of action in a movie that also has way too many CGI graphics.  Goblin's costume looked like it was directly off the Haloween shelf at Toys 'R Us.  The bulk of the action was spidey swinging through the streets of the city like a kid on a jungle gym.  Sam Raimi directs this to the best of his abilities, which seem to be quite limited.  He is no master of storytelling.  Enough bagging, let's talk positive.  Kirsten Dunst may be on her way to becoming the next Julia Roberts.  She has a wonderfully likeability about her and is plenty cute - just needs a touch more maturity and she should become highly sought after by movie-makers at the next level.  The rain proved to be quite complimentary to Miss Dunst during one particular scene.

"Good movie, but overrated, the problem was the way the story was brought to the big screen","The main problem with this movie was not the actor chosen to play/portray the central character. The main problem was the way this story was brought to the big screen Spider-Man is one of the best superheros ever, a great character, wisely written by Stan Lee as a very vulnerable, very human superhero; it is the only superhero story that actually gives a moral message, which is a great truth: with great power comes great responsibility, yet, the movie plot, unlike the comics and the TV cartoons, barely develops the relationship between Peter and uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson was a right choice for this character), instead Spider-Man offers nothing less and nothing more than what you'd expect from a superhero blockbuster: special effects, action sequences and a very light (almost weak) plot. The screenplays for Batman and Superman were written by very, very, very talented people (Mario Puzo, Frank Miller, Sam Hamm, Warren Skaaren) therefore the final product was both entertaining and interesting. David Koepp's screenplay was good and acceptable but far from great, far from captivating: no character development, no deep dialogue, no interesting human dynamics, it was simply pure summer blockbuster ""trash food"". Spider-Man 2 on the other hand, was better written. Granted Tobey Maguire probably was not the best choice to play Spider-Man, but I think he has made a good job, the problem, like I said, was the movie itself.

As far as superhero movies go, it's not as good as ""Batman"" and the first two ""Superman"" films, but it falls right behind them.""Spider-Man"" is based on the Marvel comic books about nerdy teenager Peter Parker, who gets bitten by a mutated spider and then slowly turns into the crime fighting hero of the title. The movie's special effects run hot and cold throughout, and the story could have used a little tightening. But still there's much to enjoy here. The action scenes are exciting and held my interest. Tobey Maguire is very good as Spider-Man/Peter Parker, and he gets terrific support from a very good cast. Director Sam Raimi has come a long way since directing ""The Evil Dead"", and I think he'll be a major directing force to reckon with in years to come. ""Spider-man 2"" is proof of that.**** (out of four)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Dump fire,This film is a complete disease injected into the character of Spider-Man. Unlike The Amazing Spider-Man this film does not have any comic relations.,1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Raimi spins a charming web.,"This movie has everything a film needs to be successful... big budget effects, solid cast,romance, and humor. However, the one thing it has a lot of blockbusters lack is a general concern to tell a good solid story with fully realized characters. Raimi's version had to put a smile on Stan Lee's face, because the first hour of the film captures the charm of the character and the comic. At then end of the movie, the theater I saw this in broke out with applause. The cast and crew deserve that applause for not relying only on the effects and gee whiz action scenes (attention Mr. Lucas LOL). Spiderman is a charming, fun, and well put together movie. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Awesome!!!!,This is the greatest comic book adapted movie since Batman in 1989. Everyone is amazing and every sequence is amazing and Kirsten Dunst is amazingly sexy in this movie. Especially during that rain sequence.****out of**** stars,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
perhaps the best comic adaptation of all time.,"This movie was spectacular.  I've always been an avid follower of the spiderman mythos, and this captures all the important elements perfectly. The comic was followed fairly faithfully, and all the action scenes with spidey make it feel like a live spiderman comic book.  Loved the depictions of spidey's style of fighting, and his comic poses were very accurate!The minor changes to the spidey universe did not detract from the movie at all.  The screenplay covered quite a bit of spidey history, and incorporated MANY well known storylines.  Impressive that so many years of history could be condensed and streamlined into about 2 hours.  As a comic adaptation, this is as good as it gets.The people who nitpicked about EVERYTHING obviously missed the point. This movie is not an art film.  It is a superhero movie.  Of course things will be cliche...it's supposed to be like a comic book for god sakes!  Yes, there were things that could have been improved...and a few scenes where people seemed to just read the lines...but overall, the character development was good, the personalities of the characters true to the comics, and the casting very well done.Willem Dafoe's schizoid performance at the mirror was great!  The Uncle Ben section was very moving.  Aunt May and JJ Jameson were PERFECTLY characterized.  Kirsten Dunst played a very sweet and beautiful Mary Jane. Tobey had the nerdy Peter Parker down, and his spiderman looked very good. The gimpy Goblin costume could've been better though.  He looked a lot like a power ranger villain...which I think often detracted from his credibility. Perhaps a better mask would have helped.Overall, as a movie on its own, this movie is about average or above average, which is not bad at all.  3.5 out of 5. As a comic adaptation, it is very good, and captured everything that made the comics so enjoyable.  The best and most accurate adaptation in ages, if not of all time. 4.5 out of 5.This movie will make you believe that there is a spiderman.  It is definately the best movie out right now, and I highly recommend it.  Great fun, and worth seeing more than once.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not Ageing Well,"Don't get me wrong, the movie is fine overall and the special effects are fairly decent! But the acting! Especially from the three 'teen' characters (who each look like they're in their late 20s). There is so little emotion delivered by them and they are just so awkward, and not in an endearing way.
The best scenes by far are those featuring JK Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson and Willem Dafoe's moments alone with the Goblin.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
amazing,"i'm not sure who was more excited to see this movie my husband or the kids. either way it was well worth all of us taking off work and school early to catch the first show of the day. can't wait for the sequel. the cast was great. great villain, great hero. i will see this movie again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great fun,"Well, you've heard it enough times that it's like a broken record, but you are going to have a grand old time at ""Spider-Man"".  I will say that you'll appreciate it a lot more if you're familiar with the story.  Even so, go and have fun.Trust me.  At this point, you'll feel like a mutant if you don't.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Thwip!,"Being a semi-retired comic fan, I highly anticipated this movie.  When it was first announced I was skeptical, but as I heard more I became excited. Sam ""Evil Dead"" Raimi was the perfect director for the material.  Tobey Maguire seemed to be the perfect Parker and Willem Dafoe was near the top of my list for favorite candidates for the Green Goblin.  I became quite excited for it, but not TOO excited.Did the movie meet me expectations?  Yes.  It was very good, but not fantastic.  The movie was very true to the comic with a few exceptions (no web shooters, skipping Gwen Stacey).  The acting was quite strong from everyone involved, especially James Franco who manages to make Harry an incredibly likable guy without much screen time.  The characters FELT like they did in the comic which was very important.  The effects were completely ""buyable"" despite some complaints I've heard about them around the web. Danny Elfman's score, while not as good as his previous comic book efforts on ""Batman"" was strong support, if not memorable.  The final fight sequence was also a little disappointingly a ""I beat you until you look beaten, you beat me until I look beaten"" affair.  Given the level of style and the fact that these characters can soar through the air and all the agility at Spidey's disposal, this was a bit anticlimactic.One problem I had with the movie was the some of the dialogue, was REALLY awful.  Some of Mary Jane and Peter's lines to each other felt like pre-written gushy letters rather than lines that people are speaking at the spur of the moment.  Spidey didn't make as many witty comments as he did in the book either.  The highlight of the writing definitely has to be the way that Harry Osborn was written.  In some ways he was the most likable character in the movie, and if the movie series goes the same way as the comics do with his character, well I won't reveal what might happen for those who didn't read the comic in the early 1990s.All in all a fun effort and a great success by Raimi and all involved.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
10 Star Movie,"Spider-Man was one of those quality movies that comes ever so often.  It truly was my favorite movie of all time.The casting was great, the action was great, the plot was great, the affects were great, the chemistry between Peter and Mary Jane was great, everything was great.  The perfect movie.This movie deserves every star it could possibly get, I'd even rate it off the scale if I could.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The curse of Marvel Movies has ended!,"I said to myself, ""Self, this movie better be better than any of the previous Marvel crud.""""You said it,"" came the reply.I wasn't long in discovering that this movie does live up to the hype, and that Spider-Man is a worthy summer blockbuster, what's more there *WILL* be sequels, you can believe that, True Believers.Is this the best it could have been? Well, no. Because the sappy ending seemed tacked-on (I bet you've read that before someplace.) And some of the action editing was a bit glaring, and I could tell when the Spider-Man was CGI and not a human...But still, the curse is indeed over. This movie rocked. If you're a Spider-Man fan, you'll love the integration; if you have no clue who Spidey is, then you'll learn and you'll love him. This is good stuff.I had misgivings that Tobey McGuire would be bad, that he wouldn't make me think he was Peter Parker. But actually, he did ok. I was concerned that he might not be animated enough to pull off the wise-cracking web-slinger. But he kind of grows into the role, as if Peter's new-found confidence is letting him take off a bit more. I see that as a positive thing.Go see Spider-Man, it's good. I give it a solid ""6.""",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great Flick,"I really loved it. I'm 38 now, and I loved the comic when I was a kid - and i sure was willing to spend some time with a simple story like that again. Didn't regret it - but you would, if you don't like Superhero comics.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Get a grip....,"Not as good as the first Superman or the first Batman, but still a reasonable effort.  If you liked the Spidey comic or cartoon series you'll like this...be warned though...some of the ""special"" effects look very, very dodgy indeed!!!  If you're not a superhero fan then you're probably better off looking elsewhere cause this isn't going to win any oscars!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Legendary Works,Spiderman is truly a legendary work. Tobey Maguire kills it in his rendition as spiderman. I liked the flow of the movie it was neither fast nor too slow. There was plenty of action but also plenty of romance as well. Kudos to the director for being able to include the elements of romance and action and intertwine them beautifully in a way that makes sense. There is a reason this had such a huge day at the box office Spiderman is riveting and interesting while simultaneously sentimental. I would recommend this movie to everyone and anyone looking for an exciting action flick.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A 6 from a Comic Book Fan, Why?","I'm a mediate comic book fan, and Spider-Man has always been one of my favorite movies of all time, but this movie could have been better.  I guess I was expecting something a little less cornballish from fellow MSU grad Sam Raimi and something a little more darker.  All my friends say that it is based on a comic book and it's supposed to be cornballish in ways, but that isn't true.  Look at Batman, that was seriously with a little and proper comedy relief in the mix.  Tim Burton should have directed Spider-Man.Don't get me wrong, I loved the action packed scenes and for once I actually enjoyed the CGI (which I normally hate).  Although I didn't really care for Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man, I did, however, thought that Willem Dafoe played an excellent green goblin and who could not love the very beautiful Kirsten Dunst.  The reason why I gave this a 6, is that in between all these great action scenes were these over-acted, and cornballish dialogue and romance scenes.  That is what spoiled this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fine Movie... Couldn't be great...,"This movie is o.k. I recommend it to anyone who wants to spend some with a movie that finishes happy and wants get out smiling. Sometimes we all get tired of the same old sh*t, but this one does good and times in times you will have yourself inside the movie, that means this movie is really entertaining. The effects were a bit of a let down, if you pay attention you will see that sometimes he ""throws"" his web in the air ( I really don't know how can that glue in the air :p), although it has some flaws there is never a HUGE mistake. Go to see this one with an open mind and try not to pay attention to the effects, it is not good to see flaws in a movie, it spoils everything. All in all good movie.My Rating 7/10 ( by the way the USA flag in the end of the movie sucked )",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not a Top 250 film,"I got to see this at a sneak as well.  Maybe if I had read the comics when I was younger I would appreciate the film more.  No, I don't think so. Granted, Spider-Man was my favorite superhero when I was a kid.  I had an action figure with a motorcycle, helicopter, etc. and Dr. Octopus.  Now, I'd like to see Dr. Octopus in a movie.  This movie, I feel, did not live up to its billing.  I enjoyed and even laughed during the scenes where Parker is just learning the ropes of his new powers (""Go web go!"").  But once he, or should I say a CGI, started swinging around I lost interest.  It was too fake.  I guess if the movie had come out about five years ago, the images would have wowed me, but it just didn't flow together.  It did seem a little anti-climactic as well.  Willem Dafoe was not used to his fullest potential. His Goblin was too impersonal (perhaps it was the ridiculously robotic outfit).  Anyway, it's not a Top 250 film, but I guess the comic book geeks have spoken.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This movie spells B.A.D.,"I use to be a Spider Man fan in the past, but I grew out of it.I only knew most of the story. About a Nerd who gets bitten by a Spider, gains the ability of a Spider, and soon becomes a well known super hero in New York.Faces a villain named the Green Goblin who's spending disaster in the city. And Spider Man must defeat him.I'm glad I didn't waist my money on this flick. Nothing personal but I didn't enjoy this movie too much. It didn't had the right ingredients for a good movie.If I was director of this film I'd change at least 15 things here and there.Those who like Spider Man might like it, those who don't, I suggest not seeing this movie, cause it's not a good as it seems to be.No offense in all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good but not great,"Whether you've read the comics or watched the TV show, spider-man has been everyones favorite wise guy superhero. His powers unique, the villains wondrous, and the whole concept of an average guy saving the world are what built this superhero's legacy. When I heard they were making a Spiderman movie I was just as excited as anyone. However, while I enjoyed the movie, I couldn't stop thinking to myself ""Was that really worth it"". Sure the movie portrayed his beginning well, but something seemed wrong with it. Then I realized it, Tobey Maguire just doesn't make a good spider-man. As Peter Parker, Tobey demonstrates the ""science genius"" and the whole ""self-constrained-never-on-time-for-anything"" thing accurately, he just lacks acting capabilities to portray a superhero with such a huge reputation. Actors like Willem Dafoe and Cliff Robertson were needed to keep this movie from flopping. Willem Dafoe was the perfect choice for Spiderman's arch enemy the Green Goblin and couldn't have played the part better. Cliff Robertson was excellent as Ben Parker and even though he was only in it for a short part of the movie, he really allowed audiences to feel apart of the movie and not just watching acting. I'm not saying Spiderman was a bad movie because I liked it overall, but I am saying that it was rushed and it did not live up to the true potential it had.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Captured the essence of Spiderman pretty well,"The movie seems to be based on Spiderman issues #39 and #40 where Green Goblin captures Peter Parker and reveals to him that he is actually Norman Osborne, Parker's room mate Harry Osbourne's father. Director Sam Raime focused on one of the most intriguing episode of early Spiderman series, and he was right on target with choosing Spiderman's most colorful arch enemy into the first Spiderman movie.If there was bit of a stretch was Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker and Kirstin Dunst as Mary Jane Watson. Peter Parker is a hard core New Yorker, and Tobey Maguire really didn't look like he's from New York at all, and Mary Jane Watson is supposed to be a real happy go lucky ""Me Generation"" type individual, not a muted Gen X character portrayed by Dunst. Also, role of Liz Allan (Somewhat of a love interest to Peter in high school) and Mary Jane seems to be merged into one character.Given that Spiderman is not an easy character to bring to the big screen, overall the movie captured the essence of Spiderman pretty well. If they portrayed the people around Peter Parker bit more in detail to bring out the kind of world he lives in the movie would have been even better, but for a first try, it was pretty darn good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing start to a promising franchise 6/10,"The summer movie season officially starts.....with a THUD.It seemed like a brilliant choice in picking director Sam Raimi to helm the long awaited Spider-Man, but after viewing the film it seems that he may have not been the right man for the job.  It's not that Spider-Man is a terrible film, it just seems like there was so much potential that was wasted.  The film is missing that frantic energy that should be required of this type of film.  Raimi knows how to deliver this energy, see some of his previous films (The Evil Deads, Darkman).Spider-Man is the only film I can think of in recent memory that cost 100+ million dollars yet it looks like it was made for considerably less.  The CGI in this film is absolutely atrocious.  These effects look like they came right out of the early 90's.  For a summer popcorn flick Spider-Man commits cardinal sin #1: it looks cheap.Other major problems: 1 - Laughable costume design for the Goblin. 2 - Dialogue that makes the ""yippy"" from Episode 1 sound ingenious. 3 - Plot holes: how did Parker go from his Human Spider costume, into his official Spiderman costume?  We should have seen him make it. 4 - The same old thing.  Do we really need to watch Spider-Man saving children from fires?  How many times do we need to see him stop the same bland street muggers?  Couldn't the writers think of more unique ways to showcase Spidey's powers? 5 - Takes way too long to develop the dual between the Green Goblin and Spider-Man. 6 - Speaking of the Green Goblin, everything about this character needed to be expanded on.  Why is it he wants to destroy the innocents.  The most interesting relationship in the entire film, The Goblin and his son, is barely even focussed on.There were things I liked as well.  I thought all the casting choices were superb.  Thought the final battle could have used some work, but overall it had the goods.  I just wanted more from this film, much  more.  Here's hoping the sequel can correct on some of the areas this film failed.One thing is for certain, there has only been one true Marvel superhero this year, and that's Blade!  Give this franchise to Guillermo Del Toro and let him show Raimi how to do a comic book film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
