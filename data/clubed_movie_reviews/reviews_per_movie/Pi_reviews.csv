"Although difficult to watch, a wild and amazingly unique independent film.","""Pi"" is an amazing independent films. Darren Aronofsky had never made a feature film and was barely able to scrape together the $60,000 needed to make this film. Despite this pitifully small budget, he managed to make a remarkably watchable film AND it caught the eyes of the 'big boys'--and soon he was given $1,000,000 for his film! While not quite as insanely successful as ""The Blair Witch Project"" (which came out the following year), unlike the filmmakers of this other project, Aronofsky has gone on to greater things--including the wildly successful and critically acclaimed ""Black Swan"" as well as ""The Wrestler"".Describing the look of the film is VERY difficult. Sure, it's cheap but Aronofsky managed to get past this by using black & white and deliberately making the print very grainy--giving it a wonderfully surreal look. I am not exactly sure how he did this but it worked well. And, because he wasn't able to use top equipment, it has a bit of a homemade look--which I was able to look past. Much of this was because the plot was so wild and surreal as well as very stylish.Describing the plot...well that's even MORE difficult! It's a strange tale about a man who is on the edge of losing his mind. He is convinced that everything in nature and life can be quantified and explained through mathematics. And, given that you can find the correct mathematical formula, you can predict and understand EVERYTHING. So Maximillian spends nearly every second of his waking day devoted to this all-encompassing task. He avoids relationships, is very unkempt and is a miserable excuse for a human being. And, eventually it all begins to take its toll as he begins to hallucinate and experiencing excruciating pain in his body and brain. What's next for this incredibly strange man with his seemingly impossible task? See the film!This is a very, very difficult film to rate. It gets very high marks for originality and it is entertaining. However, it's NOT a film for the mainstream. The average Joe would probably find it all just too weird and too confusing. But, if you want something different and are patient, it's well worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hard To Add Up....But An Intriguing Curiosity Piece,"Now here'a film that is ""not for all tastes,"" as the clich√© goes.""Strange"" doesn't quite cover it but it is not that bizarre that you can't figure out what's happening. Director-writer Darren Arokofsky made a name for himself with his second movie, Requiem For A Dream, and this was the young filmmakers' first effort. It was made a tight budget since he was an unknown, but that's part of the attraction. This is grainy black-and-white, and so is the gritty story and most of the characters. The unique look fits the story.It's not a story that is going to please a lot of people - an almost-demented math wizard trying to figure out stock market codes and two groups hounding him trying to cash in on his brainpower. One is trying to use him to make big money in the market and the other is trying to decipher ancient Jewish texts and thinks our mathematician can help. Meanwhile, he wants no part of any of these people.Our hero, the numbers freak, thinks the entire world revolves around numbers. Everything in the universe, he thinks, can be figured out through number codes. Not only is he wacked and paranoid but so is about everyone in here. They all have strange ideas. Innovative camera-work makes the story even stranger. In fact, it's that photography that makes this DVD a part of my collectionIf you're looking for something different here and there, I would give this curiosity piece a quick look. (It's not a long movie.) Overall, I thought this ""added up"" to an intriguing film, but if you give it a try and hate it, don't blame me.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Indie film at its best,"'Pi' is independent filmmaking at its best.  Without the constraints of the studio/corporate system, Aronofsky and Gullette created a film that is bizarre, intelligent, and unlike anything that came out of Hollywood in the 1990's.  Who would have thought to blend Wall Street, the Kabbalah, computer science, Go, number theory, and the most fascinating number in the universe in a solute of obsessive-compulsive, paranoid genius and then strain through gritty B&W cinematography and hyperkinetic editing?  The mixture is definitely not for everybody, but I certainly loved it.Plus the soundtrack (featuring Orbital, Clint Mansell, Aphex Twin. Gus Gus, Spacetime Continuum, and other techno talents) just flat-out rocks.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"not about math, but about obsession, paranoia, searching for answers never found","Pi is the kind of movie I wished I could've seen in one of those dank art-house movie theaters in New York City, as it's practically gift-wrapped for the crowds. But it's not done with every shot lingering on the characters, soaking in minimalism in its black and white photography, quite the opposite. Darren Aronofsky is a filmmaker I first got into through Requiem for a Dream, which now years after I saw it I want to revisit again upon the soon to be released the Fountain and especially after now seeing Pi. Before with 'Requiem', I did like the movie a lot, but felt a little apprehensive about deeming it that old term 'masterpiece' as the editing, while ultra fast for a purpose, almost came off as too ""MTV"" for me. But years later, after hundreds of more films taken in, I'm ready for a second look. In this particular case, Pi is also the kind of movie that warrants a second look at the director's other films. His themes run just as much together as does his breakneck style. And it's not just to show off; he truly does get inside a psychology through subjective camera AND editing, to a degree that might impress Hitchcock, albeit with some whiplash.Max Cohen played by Sean Gullette is the protagonist of the story, who's main foe is none other than the universe itself, in a sense, all through one number. Or rather, a series of numbers, one which might unlock the Stock Market secret for him. He doesn't even want to play the market, mind you, but the point for him- if one can follow- might be attributed to a repeated memory he has of looking at the sun as a boy, and soon looking past the shock of actually looking long at it. This is a very small device by Aronofsky but it works well to establish- and continue- this man's downward spiral. And spirals, by the way, seem to also figure into the film, as well as a secret technology firm (with a woman who reminded me of Condaleeza Rice look-alike), and especially a near undercover Hasidim ring where they need the numbers *in* Cohen's head to unlock some big secret to God. But even with all of this pressure, Cohen can't shake what's dogging him around, in his own cramped, wire-ridden apartment, with many bugs crawling around.The key for this movie really is atmosphere, in the acting (if it makes you uncomfortable sometimes that's the point too, and it's probably the strangest performance of a lifetime for Gullette), the production design (that apartment and the subways), the grainy, spectacular photography by Matthew Libatique, the editing to be sure- which here, unlike the breakneck 'Requiem', does take a break from the cuts so quick they almost past subliminally (which isn't bad)- and the moody music that is so slight you almost forget its there. It even works for me, and this is a big plus, as someone who's not really interested in mathematics (worst subject in school), and even better as it drew me in to his obsessions with it. I really liked one of the early scenes between Max and his the friendly Hassidic man who explains on paper different numbers and their relation to parts of the Torah. And, in the end, it all comes down to getting engrossed through what the filmmaker's bringing in with this man. There is a sort of detachment from reality- that most of us would never touch much of this with a ten foot pole- but then again it really isn't. Aronofsky also makes a point of some hallucinations/dreams adding to the ambiance, skidding almost towards the pretentious, and thus creating a world all of its own in Pi for Max, and for us as well.A film that I shall certainly seek out again when I can, if only to see if I can understand some things a little more (or maybe not as case might be), and to see such a powerhouse performance from Gullette. Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"typical ""indie"" heavy-handedness","Pi suffers from what I call the explain-it-to-the-audience syndrome,where the filmmaker is convinced that he knows something wedon't, and feels the need to explain it to us.  So whenever acharacter speaks, either directly to us in a voice over, or indirectlythrough a conversation with another character (though it is stillobviously directed at us), he is ""teaching"" us about some concept -numbers, the golden rectangle, etc.  It's not only pretentious, buttakes away any sort of realism in the characters, since they are notallowed to carry on as any real human being would.  It's hard to getabsorbed into Pi, because you can feel the director's presencelooming over every scene.  It makes the movie very tedious towatch.  Unless, of course, you're in the mood to be talked down to.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Finding God through the ancient language of Mathematics,"Pi is the oddest, hippest, most chilling account of the descent into the abyss.Following mathematical clues derived from an analysis of the stock market, Maximillian Cohen begins his descent into madness as he attempts to discover the nature of everything through the peculiar numerical entity known as Pi.Thrilling enough, but then combine with generous amounts of Kaballistic mysticism, black and white footage and a soundtrack like an audible fractal, and you have a sensory snare which drags you along for the ride into Max's impending breakdown.Obsession has never been so exciting.Pi is an utterly gut-wrenching, mind expanding phenomema. If you have ever wondered about the universe, God or the nature of insanity, Pi will take you where you don't want to go.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A promising start for one of the most talented directors of our generation,"Unsettling, creepy, tense, surreal. The film is quite similar toEraserhead (1977), another feature debut of a director (David Lynch) whose surrealism and otherworldly visuals would become a massive trademark. It was a promising start for Aronofsky, who would go on to create many now iconic films that were incredibly unique in storytelling and visual imagery. Nice one üëç",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Flat Out Great Indie Film,"This screenplay must have been turned down one hundred times before someone would finance it. I don't blame them. However, what could have been a travesty was saved by great acting, directing, cinematography, and sound. This brilliant/bizarre film turns a genius's quest to find the code for Wall Street into an adventure that engulfs all of human existence, and God. A brilliant example of how proper film making can turn straw into gold. Some viewers may be put off by the bizarre fits the main character faces, or the intrusion of complex mathematics into film, forcing the viewer to think, but if you watch this film, you will be rewarded a unique movie-going experience few other films will give you. This film gives you a look into the mind of man plagued by the genius he was given.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Dark, Gripping, but Falls Slightly Short on Believability","Writers Aronofsky and Gullette have crafted a dark, psychological thriller that centers around, of all things, math and numbers.  One would think that there was no way that this could hold anyone's interest, but they managed to pull it off.  ""Pi"" reminds us that genius is just this side of madness, and that great intelligence is a burden as well as a gift.Gullette plays Max Cohen, the brilliant and tortured mathematician, beautifully and without overacting.  His mind seethes with the possibilities that lie waiting inside number systems.  However, the strain that his talent places on him results in blinding, hallucinogenic migraines.  The scenes where Max falls victim to his ailment are tense, well-directed, and have just the right amount of creepiness.The one beef that I have with this picture pertains to the other characters who are meant to be the film's antagonists.  Two parties - a Wall Street firm and a Hasidic Jewish sect are after Max for his abilities.  Neither of these relationships are expanded on enough to make the viewer care about them.  Of the two, the sect members are the most believable.  However, the stockbrokers and Max's encounters with them scream ""film school"".  The loud-mouthed and overbearing businesswoman is more a parody of ""the suits"", and doesn't fit in with the rest of the film.  You are left thinking that the only reason these characters appeared at all was as a plot device to get Max the parts he needed.A minor, but nagging point - are we really to believe, in this day and age where nearly everyone has seen the inside of a PC, that Max's super-processor is a black cube with four pins?  I saw this film with a bunch of other techie-type folk, and our collective reaction was ""he's going to run his calculations on a bridge rectifier?""All in all, this film is entertaining for those who enjoy offbeat cinema. Those looking for ""The Matrix"" aren't going to be satisfied at all.  Math, science, and computer geeks won't wince too much.  Hollywood SFX blockbuster this isn't, but that's not a bad thing.  Overall, a good film with a few minor drawbacks.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best no-budget movie you'll ever see,"""Pi (1998)"" is, without doubt, the best no-budget movie I've ever seen. Directed by Darren Aronofsky with a ridiculous budget of $60,000 - which I first thought was a mistake in the figures, since I couldn't believe such a movie could possibly be made with that amount of money.Most of the cast and crew later re-united to make ""Requiem for a Dream (2000)"" - one of the best movies made in the last few years. Like many others, it was ""Requiem"" that made me find ""Pi"". It took Aronofsky only 2 movies to become one of my favorite directors, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for this young and promising writer/director.The movie stars Sean Gullette, which co-wrote the movie with Aronofsky and Eric Watson. You might recognize him as Arnold (Marion's old partner and shrink) in ""Requiem"". Gullette is perfect in his role and does an amazing job here. It's a shame we don't see his talent in more movies.Mark Margolis (Mr. Rabinowitz in ""Requiem"") is excellent as Max's mentor and all the other cast is doing a great job too.Like in ""Requiem"", technical aspect is top-notch: Excellent black-and-white cinematography (Matthew Libatique) and the innovative use of the Snorricam, lightning, editing (Oren Sarch), and music (Clint Mansell, frontman for Pop will Eat itself).The director's commentary for this movie is fascinating. After hearing it you'd appreciate the effort and heart that were put into this movie a lot more.Look for guest/cameo appearances by Samia Shoaib (the nurse in ""Requiem"") as Devi, Max's nextdoor neighbor; Clint Mansell (the movie's composer) as the photographer; and Abraham Aronofsky (Darren's father) as one of the men delivering the suitcase at the door.One last word. While some aspects presented in the movie - such as the Hebrew numerology and mathematical concepts - are correct (that is, the explanations of Hebrew numerology are not made-up; That _doesn't_ mean I actually believe in any of the meanings attached to them), I suggest you to use your suspension-of-disbelief instead of trying to find logic and mistakes in them.10/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mathematics + Religion x 3.14 = Avant-Garde Classic.,"Pi is one insane film.  I thought college algebra was tough and thank God there are crazy mathematical wizards like Max (Sean Gullette) to take care of digits and theorems that mean nothing to the common man.  This is not really the point of Pi, an artistic masterwork made on a $60,000 budget, meant to put the viewer through a paranoid nightmare.I was reminded of films made in the same vein like Welles' THE TRIAL, or Soderbergh's KAFKA, both black and white films with a frenetic pace and distorted narrative.  Pi is hypnotic filmmaking not meant for all tastes (by any means) and it is a wonder how writer-director Darren Aronofsky got any kind of financial backing.  His relatives probably did not see the picture until it was in the can or they may have pulled out.  This is not a knock. I found the film to be a true work of genius in an avant-garde manner, something you don't see much in American cinema these days.Here is a film that exists entirely within the main character's state of mind.  He is a math freak whose passion, or should I say obsession, is killing him literally.  To top it off, some sinister people from a religious cult want some answers through numbers and some Wall Street people are out for blood and money.  Forget plot, forget character, forget narrative. This film is a nightmare in structure and appearance.  I would not have been surprised to find the action took place in some netherworld.Why see Pi?  I guess the same reason we had to learn some of this mathematical crap in high school.  There are no redeeming qualities or any revelations made.  Just some grainy, often stunning black and white images and situations that knocks the wind out of you.  If you see it, don't look to deep for any religious or scientific symbolism, at least on first viewing.  Pi will absorb you whether you hate it or not.  This is a very ambitious outing from first-time filmmakers Aronofsky and Gullette and I give them much credit for creating a work of art I've never seen the likes of before.RATING: UNCLASSIFIABLY Good",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Interesting concept, fizzles","I liked the intrigue of this film, which is the pursuit of numerical patterns in nature from spiral galaxies down to microscopic organisms, and how it relates to the work of intellectual giants of the past (Pythagoras, da Vinci, etc). Unfortunately the film doesn't go anywhere interesting with this concept, dabbling only superficially in numerology of things like Judaism and the stock market, and even less so in actual mathematics. It meanders into being a drama with various people putting pressure on the mathematician, and others providing him with a new computer chip, none of which makes a lot of sense. It probably should have stayed away from all that stuff and the guy's disturbed mental state, and concentrated more on spiral patterns in nature, the golden rule, and interesting number patterns, whether they mean something or not. It's too bad, I liked the idea of it and the grainy black and white aesthetic, but it really faltered in the final half hour, and I found my interest fading. In the end it doesn't work as having insight into math/science because it's too shallow, and it doesn't work as a drama because the story is weak.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Cohesive, stylish and innovative","The predecessor to Requiem for a Dream, this is arguably more stylish and engaging. This is helped largely by the simply outstanding soundtrack. Aranovsky's use of a haunting yet modern score binds the movie together perfectly, aided by some fantastic cinematic techniques that disorientate the audience in time with the music. The character narration is also a great cohesive tool, with the deadpan delivery more than matching the tone of the piece. This film is not as beautiful as Requiem, nor does it have quite the same gutwrenching effect, but nonetheless, this is still some film. If you like your movies very hollywood then this is not for you; but if you like stylised innovation, then you have to watch this.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
An excellent mathematical sci-fi thriller.,"I am generally wary of movie portrayals of scientists and people who are supposedly scientific geniuses.  It seems that most movie-makers are not scientifically inclined and never manage to do a convincing job.  Pi, however, is a very interesting movie and Sean Gullette does a reaonably good job of portraying a genius on the edge of insanity.  My fears that this would be another typical bad science movie were quelled very quickly, never to return again. Of course, they didn't get all the details down pat, but most of it was believable (or close) and some of it was correct.  Comments on science aside though, I think this was one of the more interesting, and certainly one of the most original, movies I have seen this year.There are provocative metaphors hidden (well, not very deeply) throughout the movie (esp. the bugs), and the subject is so completely novel that it is really worth seeing.  In conclusion I would say that if you think a movie about number theory would be boring, in regard to this movie you would be wrong. If, like me, you think a movie about number theory would be exciting but probably done badly, then you will have to accept that this movie is not really about number theory, but about a number theorist.  As far as the execution goes though, you needn't worry about it, it is a pleasant relief from the usual.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
pretentious but watchable cult flick,"A cross between Travis Bickle, Henry Spencer (you cannot be truly hip if you don't know either), and your typical high school geek, wanders around NYC trying to find mathematical order in the universe. Along the way, he is being destroyed by his own inexplicable fits and various factions (high class businessmen, Orthodox Jews), who desire to possess the code. Upon close observation, ""Pi"" is not as revolutionary or original as it may seem. If anything, it recalls David Lynch's astonishing 1978 debut, also black and white. The similarities are many, there's even a ""girl next door"", albeit more attractive than Lynch's. But Aaronofsky is unclear on which venue to pursue, and his film walks the thin line between Avant-Garde and a contrived Thriller. That is precisely why it can't be totally cohesive or enjoyable. By the second half, the Avant-Garde visions become repetitive, and the Thriller twists all too predictable and even ludicrous. On the other hand, an intense, eeiry and captivating electronica score that captures the whole atmosphere of the movie, is of great help, and the whole premise of a genius making sense of the universe's mechanism is unique and admirable, especially in the light of today's mindless junk cinema. Flawed as it is, Pi is the only film in the past few years which makes the audience contemplate a philosophical point of view they might not be comfortable with. For that it should be praised. Those looking for a true masterpiece of surrealism should rent ""Erraserhead"" instead.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Quirky?,"Jim Jarmusch famously resents having his films referred to as 'quirky' by critics. Yet, it seems to me that many independent films, including ""Pi"", have little else going for them. Perhaps the development of rich dramatic films by independent producers has spoiled me or corrupted me. Didn't David Lynch do all this stuff in ""Eraserhead"" in 1977? Black and white, crooked cameras, troubled close ups, vague and humorless dialogue. Come on. I can understand how the new generation of math obsessed computerites can relate to the hero's psychosis over formulas, but I thought it was boring and very 'done'.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Perfect Number,"********SPOILERS******* Max Cohen, Sean Gullette, is obsessed with numbers. A mathematical genius who earned a PHD at the age of 16 has a theory about the universe and wants to prove it to his own satisfaction. 1. Math is the language of the universe. 2. Everything around us can be understood by numbers. 3. If you graph a number of any system patterns emerge, therefor patterns are everything in nature.We're told by Max at the beginning of the movie that when he was a little boy his mother warned him not to stare into the sun because it would hurt his eyes, but Max did. He stared so long into the sun that he temporarily went blind. This may be the reason in the movie ""Pi"" why Max keeps getting terrible headaches and why he's constantly taking medication to relive them.In his apartment in New York's Chinatown Max built Euclid a powerful computer that he feels can prove his theory. Using the stock market as a model Max tries to prove that even that can be deciphered by his calculations and feeds stock quotes into Euclid to prove his point by predicting their rising and falling in the future.Patterns are everywhere in nature, Max says, even in the stock market. One afternoon when Max puts Euclid to it's final test to see if his theory is correct the computer crashes. Before it did it printed out a long string of numbers that seemed to make no sense at all to Max who threw it in the garbage.Hurt that all that he did to prove his theory went up in smoke, Max goes to see his former mathematics and psychics professor Sol Robeson, Mark Margolis, to get some support and sympathy.When Sol hears that Euclid printed a list of numbers before it crashed he gets very excited and asks Max how many numbers, 100, 1,000 216 how many? Max told Sol that it was all meaningless to him and that he threw it away. Later sitting in a diner Max runs into Lenny Meyer, Ben Shenkman, an Hasidic Jew who's also interested in numbers in the interpretation of the Kabbala. Lenny then tries to get Max interested in the mysteries of the Kabbala. Max doesn't realize at the time but later in the movie when he's saved from a gang of Wall Street goons by Lenny and his Hasidic friends that the number of God in the Talmud is exactly 216 digits! The number that he so foolishly discarded after Euclid crashed! The same number of digits that Sol gave him about how many numbers did his computer print out before it blew. Max, before he found out just what that number meant, starts to realize that there was something in what Euclid's last communication was but that he stupidly threw it away. Going back to the garbage where he threw the paper with the numbers away Max finds that it's long gone.Earlier in the movie ""Pi"" we were introduced to an executive of a Wall Street firm Marcy Dawson, Pamela Hart, who was constantly pestering Max to lend his knowledge and services to her firm. Always ignoring and trying to avoid her things changed but after the crash of Max's computer Euclid. It's when Marcy offers Max something called a Ming Mecca chip, which is classified by the US government, Max suddenly becomes interested. Max needs that chip to restart his computer and find out what that important number that he so foolishly threw away was.With everything set Max starts up Euclid and after some hesitation the elusive 216 digit number comes up on the screen but for some reason doesn't get printed so Max writes it down on a piece of paper and programs it back into the computer. With Euclid giving out information Max then sees that he can predict stock prices ahead of time. It's now that Max realizes that Sol has been keeping this information about a 216 digit number that can interpret all the patterns of the universe from him all these years.Going to Sol's apartment to confront him about what he found out and why Sol tried to keep him from finding it out, Max is told by a nurse who answered the door that Sol passed away the day before. In Sol's apartment Max sees papers on which Sol wrote about what the same elusive number, God's number, was and what it meant and it seemed that the stress of all that work on Sol's part cause his death.Max finally realized, what Sol did years ago, that there is some knowledge that is better kept to itself for it's too dangerous for anyone to pursue.Very weird and at the same time interesting film by Darren Aronofsky about math and what math has to do with the working with the universe and how someone can become so obsessed with it that it can destroy him and everyone else that he comes in contact with.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pretty empty and meaningless,"While visually stimulating and never boring, PI is essentially an empty stylistic exercise.  The filmmakers were very wise to keep it to 85 minutes; if the film were longer, it would quickly become unbearable.  Besides, David Lynch has already made this movie.  ERASERHEAD is also an empty stylistic exercise, but it works better than this film does.  PI was not a bad film, but I was disappointed.  The number pi doesn't really even figure in the end - I got a bad feeling it was just a 'cool' symbol the makers thought would market their film well, like the bat symbol.  It worked on me.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Completely redefines the term ""eerie""","Pi is one of those movies that thoroughly freaked me out. I spent the next several hours wandering around in a complete daze. Every aspect of the production lends itself to this. The grainy, B+W, unsteady camera work, the sound effects (esp. the pill popping), the crispness of the narrator and Max's character in general, even more so when compared to the characters around him (which are, for the most part, utterly normal). As a mathematician this movie was utterly intriguing, bringing up facinating points about the interrelations of Math, Nature, and everything in general. But the movie's 'voice' and feel are the true gold mines here.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Genius!,"I have yet to come even close to fully appreciating the sheer artistry and complexity of Darren Aronofsky's stunning mathematical/sci-fi thriller, ""Pi"". Watching this film, one can tell from the subdued effects, grainy black-and-white filter, and guerrilla-style filmmaking that this must be a low-budget independent film - NOT to try and downplay its impact, as many independent films can clearly surpass any typical Hollywood movie, in terms of style and subject matter.""Pi"" is a perfectly concrete example of how the relative absence of special effects, explosions, etc. can still help create an engaging, and thoroughly unique viewing experience. Overflowing with intensity and hyperkinetic camerawork, this is a frightening roller-coaster ride of a film; despite clocking in at less than 90 minutes, ""Pi"" is by no means short on resonance - but rather leaves a heavy feeling of exuberance and fascination with the material that lasts long after it's finished. At the same time, though, people who aren't as open-minded to more obscure, abstract films like this would be, I think, surprised. This is not as complicated or bewildering a film as I had expected. If one can be able to focus intently on the story, the result is rewarding, and doesn't provide for much head-scratching. Its style seems rather modern, rather hip...at times it reminded me of ""The Matrix"" (which, ironically, was released the FOLLOWING year) what with its slick techno musical score and its flashy opening credits.To shy away from this film simply because of its math content is to be completely shallow and ignorant. The way it handles the material is a whole lot more interesting than you'd probably think. Like ""A Beautiful Mind"", ""Pi"" is an instant classic that serves to re-awaken my erratic interests in my poorest subject, mathematics. It's original, it's interesting, and above all - genius.",,Anonymous,Horror
Very impressive debut from Darren Aronofsky,"I heard much about this film, and having been so impressed with Darren Aronofsky's other work especially The Wrestler and Requiem for a Dream I was all for seeing it. And I found it was very good, certainly an impressive debut for Aronofsky. It is probably my least favourite of what I've seen so far of his, however that doesn't mean it is bad at all, far from it.Aronofsky's films are not for all, I think of his films I think his most accessible is The Wrestler, Requiem for a Dream is very hard-hitting with its theme, Black Swan's psychology is intense and very hard to take, The Fountain is very philosophical and perplexing and some may find Pi's film techniques too much at first. But actually, I don't consider these a bad thing, if anything that's why his films are so fascinating to me.And I have to say I loved Pi's gritty film technique and thought it added much to the concept and tone of the film. The soundtrack is excellent, it broods with intensity and is very cleverly used. The script is both intelligent and bizarre, and the story in general is compelling and benefits from such an interesting concept, I have to say of Aronofsky's films I'd say Pi had the most intriguing idea.Darren Aronofsky once again does a fine job directing, while the acting led by a charismatic Sean Gulette is very good. The pace generally is good, but loses its way a tad in the final third or so, and I also think it was about 5 or 6 minutes too short. But these don't harm the film too much considering how much promise it had and how much it delivered this.Overall, very impressive. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great first feature.,"Pi is Darren Aronofsky' first feature film and the second Aronofsky film I've seen. Previously I had only seen black swan and I love it. Pi is very obviously early in his career.It's very fast paced and stressful throughout, safdie brothers style filmmaking mixed with Edgar wright style editing, it worked out fine. The reason I think it's so stressful though is the fantastic score. The music reminded me of birdman which has one of my favourite scores of all time, it makes every single scene levels better than it could have been. The score in birdman is better but it was also made for millions more. I was very impressed by pi technically.Max is an interesting character and Sean Gullette is pretty good for the most part, some of the line delivery was a bit odd but it didn't ruin the movie.The worst thing about pi is the story, I lost interest in the story after 30 minutes and started to focus more on the character which didn't get much development during a large portion of the second act as well.I like the theme being conveyed. I think what Aronofsky is saying is that everything is determinable but it's better that humans as a species shouldn't understand, we can't be trusted with such information.Pi is a good first feature that has elements of current Aronofsky riddled throughout. If you like Darren Aronofsky you should absolutely check this out.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Tormented Soul of the Mathematician,"There is so much pain in this film, it is so unsettling. While hard to watch, I couldn't take my eyes off it. The central character abuses drugs, hides, and lives in a circle of computer hardware, like a kind of Phantom of the Opera organ. He plays with numbers and sees patterns. People are aware of him because he has insights into the stock market and, ultimately, the Hassidic faith. He is pursued by bad guys, but it is ultimately his own demons that go after him. He drills holes in his head and punches drugs into his system. Eventually he finds a set of 216 numbers that provide and answer and incredible danger. This movie is not for everyone. It is so frantic, moving at the breakneck pace of an amphetamine high. Because I admire mathematics, I will take those three repeated premises with me: (1) that mathematics is the language of the universe, (2) nature can be expressed in numbers, and (3) there are patterns everywhere. I won't look at the world quite the same after this.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
An intense and surreal cerebral thriller.,"It's fitting that this should be Darren's debut work, seeing as how this is the first of his filmography that I'm personally seeing. The film itself is alright, but there are things that hold it back.The pros specifically lie in the film's style and direction. The grainy black and white aesthetic compliment the oppressive and obsessive tone of the film. And the same goes for Darren's directing. While I personally wouldn't call it anything 'groundbreaking', the composition of the shots themselves are great and again play along with the film's tone and theme of obsession and paranoia.The film's cons however lie in its writing and structure. The film's structure is scatterbrained to say the least. While the story isn't difficult to follow, the way the story is presented and concepts that are dotted throughout make the film a bit harder to process. And the surrealist elements while not exactly intrusive don't really help alleviate this confusion. The writing as well isn't really much to write home about, and in some instances can be written off as pretentious.As I said before ""Pi"" was my introduction to Darren Aronofsky's works and from what I've seen, I can't really say that I'm too impressed. Granted I have yet to see ""Requiem"" or the highly controversial ""mother!"", so hopefully my mind will change then. The central idea of this film is certainly fascinating despite its loose math, and based on the direction and style alone is certainly worth a watch or two.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The descent into madness doesn't always end in chaos...,"PI is unlike any film I have ever seen. Shot on a handheld camera in black and white, it has the jitters like a 14 year old wired on Espresso from Starbucks.The visual style of this film sets it apart from the crowd at the first available moment.  Shot in grainy black and white, the filmmaker achieved a dark, and moody atmosphere from which to view the workings of a genius mathematician.  A solid choice in my mind, seeing only light and dark, id and ego, alpha and omega, without the clutter of color. His is the world of a mathematician bent on proving order, in a universe of apparent chaos.The story - a mathematician is seeking order through mathmatics in a chaotic world, using a supercomputer that occupies a good portion of his small apartment.  He is, as all good protagonists are, flawed. Max Cohen suffers from a childhood illness - causing him great pain.  His search for order, brings him into close contact with a religious group obsessed with numerology, and a group of wall streeters - fighting for the rights to his abilities.The movie is tough to encapsulate beyond that.PI is a must see.  It may not be your usual fare, but the powerful filming, editing, and offbeat scoring keep you involved throughout the 85 minute run time.Darren Aronofsky has made a truly unique film, one that put me in quite the same mood as Eraserhead or Videodrome, which I think is more of a compliment to Lynch and Cronenberg given that PI was more riveting, and thought provoking than either of them.8/10 - PI Will soon be added to my own collection...",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Low key thriller that is interesting rather than intense or gripping,"Max Cohen is a mathematical and computer genius who seeks mathematical patterns in everything.  However he also suffers from intense headaches, dellusions and some paranoia.  He looks into patterns in the stock market only to find his ability sought by both a Wall Street trader, Marcy Dawson, and a Hasidic, Lenny Meyer, who both want the code for different reasons.Before I saw this I must admit I heard a lot of hype but no actual details ¬ñ so I was half-expecting an intense `Usual Suspects' thriller mixed with maths.  So I was a little disappointed at first.  However once over my preconceptions I was able to settle into this.  That is, if you can `settle into' something like this.  The story is clever it plays on paranoia and delusion ¬ñ in fact it may or may not happen.  Even at the end of the film I was left wondering if Max was a genius or if he was a nutter and all this was in his mind.  The film uses this paranoia to create some good scenes and the thumping base music ups the ante a bit.It's not an easy film to enjoy in the traditional sense, but it is an experience.  The subject matter is different enough to be interesting and the telling is clever ¬ñ I for one can't wait to see what the director does with Batman: year one, it certainly won't be a camp Joel Schumacher film anyway!Gullette (who also co-wrote) is good in the lead and is totally convincing. Mark Margolis is also good and it's good to see him in different roles, I know him from his strong role in Oz although he's not as good here.  The rest of the cast are good ¬ñ but really the star here is the director as he manages to put us in Max's mind and involve us in the paranoia so thoroughly that we're not sure what is real and what isn't.Overall this isn't as masterly as the hype suggests but it's different enough and compelling enough to be more than gripping for 90 minutes.",,Anonymous,Horror
visually interesting,"the best thing about this movie: lighting.  the stark black and white contrast used worked excellently to illustrated the movie's theme mathematics and nature.  the soundtrack worked well and the main drawback is the dialogue, which often came off as trite.  the play ""arcadia"" by tom stoppard covered much of the same material with dialogue that was far superior, but ""Pi"" is a movie, and delivers what a movie should: compelling sight and sound.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Intriguing and Hypnotic Cult Movie,"The mathematician Maximillian Cohen (Sean Gullette) is tormented by a severe migraine since he was a kid, and he uses many pills to reduce his painful headaches. He is a lonely man, and his only friend is his former professor Sol Robeson (Mark Margolis). Max has the following assumptions, which rules his life: (1) Mathematics is the language of nature; (2) Everything around us can be represented and understood from numbers; (3) If you graph the numbers in any systems, patterns emerge. Therefore there are patterns everywhere in nature. Based on these principles, Max is trying to figure out a system to predict the behavior of the stock market. Due to his research, Max is chased by a Wall Street company with obvious interest in the results of his studies, and by an orthodox Jew follower of the Torah, who believes that this long string of numbers is a code sent from God.""Pi"" is an intriguing and hypnotic cult movie, with an original story, great music score, fantastic black and white cinematography and bizarre atmosphere that in some moments recalls ""Brazil"". It is amazing it effects on me, maybe because of my formation in engineering and economics science, but I really like this movie a lot. The first time I saw this movie, on 17 August 2002, I was really impressed with the originality of this tense story.

Brilliant and confusing,"""Pi"" is about a brilliant mathematician who finds himself tracked down by code-seeking Jews and a strange corporation, both of whom are seeking the same thing: a universe-unlocking sequence of numbers that explain the sequences in life, etc.This movie is weird. It's confusing and dark. It's also utterly brilliant in the way director/writer Darren Aronofsky manages to make the most out of a low-budget by way of creepy black and white photography (which makes for very paranoid viewing) and surprisingly convincing acting. Also I found the fact that this ""drama"" is scarier than most horror films released nowadays quite refreshing.I wish more movies were like ""Pi."" It is bewildering and a bit alienating, yes, but nevertheless totally mesmerizing and entertaining. It is well-directed, well-written and unlike anything I have ever seen before, although if comparisons must be drawn it reminded me a bit of ""Memento"" for some reason.

Low budget movie making at its very best.,"This movie almost literally cost nothing to make but this is not notable on screen. The movie is good looking and made with lots of style and flair.I'm probably not the biggest Darren Aronofsky fan around, since I'm not always fond of his visual style but I still respect him as a movie artist. I even quite liked his style for this movie, even though some of the moments were still a bit too weird for my taste. He uses a similar atmospheric, visual style as he used for ""Requiem for a Dream"" but difference in my opinion is that that style works better for this movie than it did in ""Requiem for a Dream"".The movie is definitely a case of style over substance. The story itself is even quite boring when you think about it and certainly is not always understandable but it truly is the style that makes this movie an unique and also successful one. Its low budget movie making at its very best; Minimun resources, maximum result.The actors aren't really the best ever and that is quite notable throughout the movie but like mentioned before, it doesn't really matter since this movie is all about the style and atmosphere and with that there is little wrong in this movie.In a way, a real must see.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

It's not so black and white.,"This intriguing film reminded me of David Lynch's Eraserhead somewhat. The soundscape of the movie was very industrial in places and the metaphorical imagery used was reminiscent of the early Lynch film. Unlike Eraserhead however this effort has ""student film-maker"" written all over it, which is not to detract from the entertainment value of the movie.The movie's protagonist thinks mathematics can provide the answers to the big questions, but finds out the painful way that it cannot. This is all illustrated quite appropriately within a hallucinatory milieu. Unfortunately is it all a bit too obvious unlike David Lynch who can have machinations within machinations to the point of indecipherability. That criticism aside, the lighting, sound effects and photography were all interesting and combined to provide a claustrophobic feeling and a sense of unrelenting futility.To sum the piece struck me as the early work of a director who is on the up and up. I am looking forward to seeing some more of his work in the future. I enjoyed this movie despite its flaws and give it a 6/10 score.",,Anonymous,Horror

A very effective thriller,"I really like watching weird films. It's interesting to see all the imagination that Directors can put into their films. In fact, Eraserhead (1977) is one of my favorite films of all time. Seeing that Pi was a low budget debut film, I was curious what Aronofsky would be able to do with it, because I heard that it looked very good despite its budget. The film looked very good, and I found it to be a very interesting film.A paranoid mathematician named Max attempts to find a pattern in the Stock market which will also unlock the universal patterns found in nature. However, hallucinations continue to hinder his path and as the film continues on, it becomes more difficult to tell what's real and what isn't.Max goes through internal and external conflict in the film. His internal struggles are the hallucinations he experiences and the first phase of a deterioration of his body starting with a bump on his head. These symptoms often come into effect when he's at crucial points in his objective. If he's getting info from Lennie, he might have to rush home before it takes its toll on him. Also, if he's attempting to find the 216 digit number on his computer, the hallucinations and pain can make him lose his mind, scream at the top of his lungs, or try to destroy his equipment in a fit of range. If the hallucinations didn't effect his experiments, one could argue that they felt a little tacked on. However, director Darren Aronofsky was able to work them into the conflict he faced in the film, and he avoided having them feel gratuitous.The external conflict he encounters mainly comes into the film near the latter portion of the film. When it happens, it changes the film entirely, and it makes a lot of events make sense which we saw earlier in the film. It's a very interesting way of showing you how his simple task turned into something much, much more. It also makes the ambiguity of the films ending have a great impact on the viewer and it leaves you thinking about it, and what exactly Max did. The film takes a common weird trope for weird films, hallucinations, and it creates conflict in the film out of it.The hallucinations in the film are really well-done. The main reason why they work so good is because we are able to feel Max's pain during them. The sudden and striking sound effects which the viewer hears plays a main role at making the viewer feel these unpleasant emotions with Max. Sounds can sometimes effect our emotions more than visuals. You could always remove the sound and hope for the viewer to connect the dots at what the protagonist is feeling. However, a simple loud sound effect can frighten the viewer even more. This movie does a really good job at using this technique to terrify the viewer who's watching the film.Having a low budget can really take a viewer out of the movie if the director is not thrifty. Poor scenery and effects can be a real withdrawer and it can kill immersion quickly. However, despite having such a minuscule budget, the effects and scenery looked top notch. The computers and the setup of Max's room that Max uses look convincing and realistic, and since there's so many machines around his apartment which look high-tech, it looks like a believable work station for something so complicated that he's doing. Also, the effects looked very good as well. They looked realistic for a low-budget film, and they still hold up today pretty well. It's a great trait for a director to be able to do so much with so little. That's exactly what Aronofsky did here, and by doing so, he proved that he was a talented director.When some people watch a movie, they often like to kick back and relax. This movie doesn't let you. Sometimes, the movie can be hard to watch at times. It's not for everyone. Some people dislike Eraserhead for that reason. However, I love these kinds of films. I love the sprightly feelings that they evoke from the viewer. I feel like I can revisit them again and again, and every time I do so, they still impress me as much, if not, more than my first viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Paranoid, mathematical genius tries to unlock the power of Pi. Loses mind. A typical love story.","I've always been terrible at math. It is easily my weakest suit. I have always suspected it would become one of my greatest downfalls. That is, before I saw this movie. Now I can see that being a mathematical genius isn't what it's cracked up to be. (What with the limousines and paparazzi) It's much better being stupid. But as dense as I am, I'm still fairly adept at using power tools in the fashion recommended by the manufacturer, unlike our so-called genius.This film was a favourite at the Sundance Film Festival, and won the Director's award. It's shot in grainy black and white, on a super low budget in the neighbourhood of $35,000 if I remember correctly. All funds were raised by cast and crew, and the director's mother was part of the catering services. Despite my phobias about math, and therefore an inherent lack of knowledge about it, I still found the film intriguing and innovative. Sometimes the camera angles can create an unpleasant disorienting effect, but not too often, for not too long, and not without good reason.The story's protagonist, Max, is not likely someone you can relate to, but rather empathize with. We all sometimes want to be left alone; Max always wants to be left alone. He is a man without peace, who's being watched and with an obsession of Pi to work out. It is a very dark film, that grows darker with each passing minute. Not for your happy-ending kind of target audience. It should be interesting to see what the makers of ""Pi"" do next with the attention they received for this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A classic indie psychological thriller,"I thought this movie was badass for how it made suspenseful story that focused on math, patterns and numbers. Somehow the fact that it was a black and white film made it even cooler and feel more real to me.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Understanding reality is easy as Pi,"There are scientists who present the idea that the mathematical constant Pi contains the Universe itself. The theory states that, since the decimals of Pi are infinite and so go on forever, if you break out enough of its neverending digits, you will at some point start to find patterns; codes, basically. And if you continue beyond that, you should find the ""code"", if you will, of this entire reality. Surely this specific type of number sequence must exist somewhere inside a number that, again, never ends?Pi is seemingly a movie about mathematics, which I'm hesitant to mention lest I scare off lazy college or high school students who'd miss out on a deep and intelligent film that explores madness, genius, and nature itself, and is much more than just a math lesson. It's the directorial debut of Darren Aronofsky and certainly his most surreal, not to mention disturbing, work.Sean Gullette plays Maximillian ""Max"" Cohen, a brilliant but paranoid man whose obsession with math has led him to believe that everything in the Universe can be understood through numbers; codes found in nature that could answer everything. A little girl next door asks him to calculate complex math problems in his head and his only friend, his aging mentor Sol (Mark Margolis) invites him over for games of Go. Sol speaks words of caution regarding Max's obsessive quest for answers but Max feels that Sol is merely a quitter. This is probably the most you'll ever see of Mark Margolis in an Aronofsky movie - he's in all of them so far but it's not easy to tell.Max spends much of his time staring at the flickering monitors of his computer, Euclid, writing notes and hallucinating nightmarish visions. At a diner, he meets a Jewish man, Lenny (Ben Shenkman). Lenny works with Gematria, the Hebrew math alphabet, and presents the old theory that the numbers found in the Torah are in fact codes sent to humanity by God. Shortly after this encounter, Max finds himself pursued by a Jewish organization and mysterious Wall Street agents, all of whom have taken a keen interest in Max's extraordinary brain and what unspeakable secrets could be stored/solved within.With a monochrome look that feels like a charmful tribute to 1989's Tetsuo: The Iron Man or David Lynch's 1976 masterpiece Eraserhead, and cinematography that reminds of Aronofsky's future film Requiem for a Dream, the movie is beautiful yet sometimes maddening to behold. The music fits the uneasy and somewhat trippy mood - in addition to Clint Mansell's score, the soundtrack includes equally psychedelic songs from artists such as David Holmes, GusGus and the ever so peculiar Aphex Twin, whose insane but creative electronica is nothing less than flawless for a film like Pi.Sean Gullette carries the film with skill and Maximillian's horror and paranoia is often shared by the audience. Much like the aforementioned Eraserhead, the more disturbing bits of the film are shot and edited in a way that, even though they're strange and unusual, still feel eerily similar to what most would consider a nightmare - the most skillful horror to pull off, in my mind.Some of the symbolism is also admirable. The game of Go plays an especially significant role. More complex than Checkers and Chess both, it is used to illustrate how opposed Max and Sol are becoming to one another (black and white, if you will), which is also made clear by how their respective interpretations of the game represent their respective interpretations of the Universe's complexity. Sol has accepted chaos; Max insists that there's more. Other parts involve Max finding his own brain bleeding out in a bathroom sink and seeing strange lights in his doorway. Once again I'm reminded of the works of Lynch.Pi is a good-looking, thought-provoking and intellectual thriller that doesn't get its thrills from action set pieces, car chases, or whatever else feels obligatory for most thriller filmmakers. Instead it all works thanks to Gullette, who plays a sympathetic genius that wants to be alone in a world that won't leave him. How he solves this is one of the more gruesome scenes in the film but at least he's free. They say ignorance is bliss. Perhaps it's true.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"oh, man, this was such a cool movie (a horror film about...  math? brilliant!)","I saw this a while back so I really can't give a very concrete review, but there are a few things I'd like to mention- first of all, yes, the math involved here is somewhat absurd...  oh, but wait a minute, who goes to a feature film to LEARN ABOUT MATH? I think it's pretty sad that there are people who are so obsessive about scientific accuracy that it prevents them from enjoying a brilliant movie not really about math but about PARANOIA. In fact, this would have been a much lesser movie if the math had made any sense; it would have made Max's quest justifiable and could easily have turned this into a sappy Hollywood film (better living through mathematics/paranoid self-obsession: max figures it all out and makes millions, retires and marries the woman next door, haha, wouldn't that be fun?). Instead, it becomes an impressionistic descent into a half-hallucinated hell, and wow, when you realize what's going on, it is gripping. The grainy black and white provides the perfect palette for the film's remarkable, sometimes very frightening images, and the brilliant techno score by Clint Mansell (formerly of Pop Will Eat Itself) backs up what is certainly one of the most compelling films I've ever seen.Well, ok, so the editing is a little too ""MTV,"" but what did you expect?",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Aronofsky debut,"Maximillian Cohen is sickly and math obsessed. He is building his Euclid computer in his small New York apartment as a way to understand and predict the world.

He is also hounded by Marcy Dawson from a powerful financial consortium. They offer him a supercomputer chip. The computer outputs a number and everybody wants it.This is a debut from Darren Aronofsky with great originality. It has great paranoid thriller vibe. The music, the style, and Max all build a great obsessive mood. There are some things to nit-pick. The camera work is strictly indie. The action scenes are a little dizzying and not in a good way. It's unlikely that Aronofsky had the equipment to do better although some low-budget indies do better somehow. The acting from some of the secondary characters could also be better. They are all understandable indie deficiencies.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not really about 3.14159... per se,"Pi, I understand, has now been factored to over a billion places. My question: are the figures random? Anybody out there know? This film does not answer that question (nor does it address it). What it asks is, are numbers the language of life? Max Cohen, mathematical genius, believes they are. There is a pattern, and he would like to find it, partly because it's there and partly for use in the stock market. So would some other people. He is thus tormented both within and without.One of the things that made this a successful commercial film (for an indie venture, of course) is the fine acting by Sean Gullette who plays Max Cohen.He was entirely convincing as a reclusive and paranoid mathematical genius; but he is also a man like Einstein who emanates charisma and something perhaps beyond charm. Also effective was the story by Director Darren Aronofsky, which, unlike some indie films, actually had a plot with clear conflicts. The choice of Pamela Hart, a strong black woman as a kind of hit woman from Wall Street was excellent. Also very good was Mark Margolis as Cohen's mentor, Sol Robeson. Aimed at a popular audience were, alas, some chase scenes; but they were not badly done, and even seemed appropriate, although I think there should be a moratorium placed on subway chase scenes in movies, at least for the next decade or so. Also aimed at a popular audience was some of the violent images, in particular the scene where Cohen places the power drill to his temple, like the barrel of an executioner's handgun, turns it on and presses. Kids love that shtick. (I could hardly watch.)Much of the detail was completely veracious, the spiral as an example of complexity in nature, or the wonderful re-enactment of the programmer's moment of truth just before he hits the return key and finds out if his creation will run, crash or go into infinite loop; or a group of fundamental religious people (in this case Hasidic Jews) believing that some sort of numerology will miraculously reveal some major truth of their religion; or even the fact that Max Cohen still used five and one-quarter inch floppies for his data. Also wondrously right was the spider/moth sticky cocoon that gummed up his computer, or the little girl who multiplies on her calculator and then asks Max for the answer, delighted when he gets it right. That a stock market bonanza served as the El Dorado of number crunchers was also right on target. And an especially good fit was the techno rock in the background.But some of this was definitely wrong. The idea that Sol Robeson would think Max's computer had become or was becoming ""conscious"" was too much of a leap. Or the notion that the human brain, or any brain for that matter, could predict stock prices as they come out of the ticker is absurd. Complexity theory would argue strongly that such specific data, like the number of rain drops in a storm tomorrow, is in principle impossible to predict. I also didn't like the resolution which allows us to treat whichever of the foregone scenes we like as dream-fantasies. I don't like plots that are resolved by ""it was a dream"" mechanisms, even, or especially, retrospective ones.But movies are about images and the image of Cohen's head and his brain and of what hard, metallic things can do to it, is something that lingers long after the lights have come up. Indeed what makes this an engrossing movie is its psychological and visual content. The stark, grainy black and white cinematography actually enhance our appreciation. Indeed, light and dark and other dichotomies are part of the expression of Aronofsky's vision. He juxtaposes contrasting elements of our culture, of the mind and of nature to tease us into seeing that the world is vastly more mysterious than we can imagine. There is order and there is chaos. There is number and there is the organism that is an expression of number. There is rationality and there is insanity. There is the soft, fragile brain and the hard electrodes. There is the game of go, more complex than chess, the wooden board with the simple lines and the black and white pebbles that spring open the door to chaos (the mathematical kind). And there is life, fragile, uncertain, teetering on the edge, and in the fuzzy distance there is the shimmering certainly of a fundamental religion. Aronsky catches all of this and ends up with an electronic poem camouflaged as a movie.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

Leaves you with more questions than answers,"Being a mathematical person (I have a Masters degree in Statistics) I was intrigued by the premise of the movie but in the end I was left with more questions than answers and was left hanging. The plot includes too much of the mathematical detail (and medical detail, listing all the drugs Cohen was taking!), often coming across as nerdy.The solution seemed too straightforward and practical, with many details lacking here (unlike in the build-up). I thought the final mix might include emotions, basically a more relationship-centric argument, especially as the plot did allude to the potential for something to happen between Cohen and his neighbour, but this didn't come up at all.This all said, Darren Aronofsky is clearly a very talented director. His use of the black&white medium and close-up camera shots in Pi were a stroke of genius - it certainly helped one get into Cohen's mind. Requiem for a Dream is an outstanding movie but Pi fails to deliver because he took on a very weighty and complex subject in his first attempt at a motion picture. The problem lies in the screenplay (which he co-wrote), and not his direction, however.It is interesting to note Aronofsky's use of some of the effects that he would later use in Requiem for a Dream, especially the fast- forward pill-popping sequence which was always worth a chuckle in both movies (in a dark sort of way).",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pi accomplishes so much with stress and paranoia portrayed in its unique style.,"A mathematician struggles to find the relevance of a number that taunts him in his stressed out life. It gives him head aches, induces hallucinations and blurs the line of reality. The story progresses as he tumbles down in paranoia only to find peace. His craze to find the significance of Pi is troubled by the attempts of others who search for the same cause but for their own personal benefits.The movie is unique in its horrifically smart style and portrayal of a deranged mind and the actions it can make him take. With lots of close ups and disturbing music, 'Pi' is one black and white movie for the psycho-movie crowd.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Numbing numbers,"'Pi' is a fascinating film, a remarkable debut and highly memorable but not a repeat watcher! It's overly prescriptive narrative is surely born from a singular creative mental journey on the part of the writer director Aronofsky. This very singularity of mind and purpose leaves the finished film strangely un-layered and unconvincing on second or third viewings but first time up it's an absolute humdinger. I think that it's the first film problem: Aronofsky struggles to leave things unearthed, to leave paths untrodden, and in the end 'Pi' lacks an enabling element from its matrix: possibility, potential, promise.I can only applaud the film achievement considering it's tiny budget and production scale. There is a good use of black and white - but mainly grey - cinematography, a completely complementary sound scope and a direction and editing which brings energy to the story. The acting is passable from the small cast, they all just about deliver performances to their characters within this story.Indeed, as a study of mental irregularity, both neurological and behavioural, on the part of the protagonist, is perhaps where 'Pi' ends up at its best. I am not convinced that this was the definitive intent however. This was meant to be one strand in the story, that's how the film seems to me, but it ended up as the crux of it.I rate at 6.5/10 and, I think, that had the writer-director kept something in reserve, in the writing and in the direction, then this film could have been one of the greatest first time movies in the history of the movies.As it stands I recommend to speculative sci-fi fans which is where I ultimately place Pi in my mind; it seems at home with bleak and reflective speculative fiction, with certain subgenres of literary sci-fi and fantasy, perhaps a Phillip k Dick novel.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not a Modern Prometheus,"Like Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein"", ""Pi"" aims to be a modern update to the greek Prometheus and Icarus myths. It warns against scientists venturing into certain areas of knowledge. Unfortunately one point where ""Pi"" fails miserably is in its depiction of modern science: the days of early greek scientists working mostly alone is long gone, modern science is very much a social endeavor. ""Pi"" however sticks to the rogue scientist image embodied in the loner mathematician Max Cohen. Its modernization seems to be limited to technological aspects: there's a lot of technobabble about patterns in the number Pi, computers becoming sentient etc. All good natured fun in ""Star Trek"" but the seriousness with which it is brought in ""Pi"" made its inaccuracy really annoying. Perhaps the movie's makers should have used Shelley's approach to avoid embarrasing themselves: just mention all that technology is dangerous and you don't want to talk about it to avoid corrupting the reader/viewer. But then again, what would have been left in this movie? Nothing much I'm afraid, Max doesn't seem to be a very interesting character, his relationship (or lack thereof) with his female neighbour is only briefly touched upon etc. Overall ""Pi"" is repetitious, contains too many scenes of Max just vomiting/banging his head into something/... and is just plain boring.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"good film techniques, grainy feel, weird atmosphere","Darren Aronofsky's Pi is definitely a unique and innovative film. Starring a genius mathematician who has found the numerical key to the stock market, Pi takes you on a wild black and white adventure through his struggle against forces who want to use his discovery for their own purposes. Aronofsky's style becomes evident throughout the film as he uses not only the obvious black and white color scheme, but unique editing and camera techniques that contribute to a kind of surreal atmosphere and the very distinct feel of Pi. The first question is: why did Aronofsky choose to go black and white?  I think black and white has two major advantages.  First of all, now that Hollywood color cameras have become so good, modern color films please the eye but look less realistic.  They are saturated with bright, vibrant colors that make evident the use of predetermined lighting setups and look too crisp and beautiful to be real.  This can be avoided by reverting to black and white as Aronofsky did.  Secondly, if used deftly, black and white brings out the contrast of lights and darks, which looks more visually appealing.  Photographers often shoot in black and white because it brings out this pure contrast, without the viewer being fixated on color, and Aronofsky follows suit.  We best see the beauty of black and white in the opening scene, when Max is lying face-down on his desk.  The shadows on his face stand out against his silvery eyelid, which is the only moving thing in the picture. This image feels and looks very attractive, and hooks the viewer in so that he is interested in what this film is about. I think the use of black and white was successful with Pi. Besides the black and white color scheme, Aronofsky uses original editing techniques in Pi.  Whenever Max Cohen, the protagonist, takes his pills, we hear the cap on the pill container popping, him saying things like `200mg penicillin, marinol, 1mg dihydrogen mezolate.', fast-paced techno music, and the pills as they are swallowed.  We see flashing, fast-cut  images of pills being taken.  This scene is repeated throughout the movie and serves as a kind of constant repetition that keeps the viewer familiar and in rhythm with the movie.  Another example of Aronofsky's inventive editing is the scene in the subway, when Max pokes his own brain with a pencil. Every time he touches the brain, a sharp, high pitched buzzing noise ensues and the screen flashes white.  After a while, the white screen dissolves into an image of an oncoming subway train.  This scene provokes a kind of disgusted, `weirded-out' reaction in the viewer that could not have been created had it not been for Aronofsky's editing.  The editing of Pi contributes to its very different feel, and both the pills and the brain scene add to what makes this film different from any modern Hollywood thriller. A particular scene that I find demonstrates great mis-en-scene is the one in the subway, when Max is walking hesitantly towards what seems to be his own brain sitting on the stairs.  It is set up symmetrically, and the ceiling supports on either side of Max vanish into a very clear, even horizon line.  It is at first a long shot, where we can see Max's hesitant movements and body language from a distance.  The white pillars in the subway station contrast sharply with the dark floor.  Then, as Max moves forward, we can distinguish his features and the screen becomes black with his jacket and pants, and when he kneels down to examine the brain, his face is lit strongly by studio lights.  All the while, suspenseful synthesizer rhythms are playing in the background. This scene has a bizarre atmospheric tone to it, and is very characteristic of the entire film. The great mis-en-scene and editing of Pi fit it into the Formalist category.  Although the action scenes, such as the one where Max chases a photographer out the subway and into the street, are shot with a shaky camera, every angle seems calculated to provide exciting visuals rather than to document events realistically.  When the movie mellows out, such as in the numerous scenes in Max's apartment, the camera rarely moves.  Instead of panning around, Aronofsky simply changes our view of the action.  This is more quiet and subtle, instead of having so much Blair Witch-esque movement. Also, the fast cuts in the pill scenes were definitely predetermined and Formalist.  Overall, I think Pi is well put together and that its Formalist shots are beautiful. Pi is a great example of the best things that come from low budget independent movie making. Aronofsky proves to us that ideas are more important than money, and good acting more interesting than special effects. It's a pity mainstream Hollywood ignores this time and time again.  With its grainy, flashing, black and white textures, beautifully put together scenes, and fresh editing techniques, Pi is an innovative masterpiece of underground film.",,Anonymous,Horror
A beautiful mind,"Darren Aronofsky scores another triumph with ""Pi"". We greatly admired his previous film, ""Requiem for a Dream"". The director, writing his own material in collaboration with the star of the movie, Sean Gullette, shows he is a new voice to be reckoned with. Mr. Aronofsky shows he is an original, as he clearly demonstrates with his take on the film.""Pi"" has been already the object of many fantastic comments submitted to this forum, so we'll just skip that part and go into the technical points of the film. Mr. Aronofsky has shot ""Pi"" in black and white that is grainy as he seems to emphasize in what's going on in the mind of Max Cohen. It works well because using colors would have distracted our attention, perhaps, and it wouldn't have left the lasting effect he achieves with the use of the black and white cinematography.Sean Gullette, as Max Cohen makes an immense contribution to the film, which clearly, having been co-written by him, shows he had a complete understanding of what the director intended him to do. Others in the supporting cast, Mark Margolis, the amazing Ben Shenkman and Pamela Hart turn fine performances under Mr. Aronofsky's direction.We look forward to future films by the director.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Flawed Look at the Madness of Obsession,"I'm a big Darren Aronofsky fan. I have been ever since I saw The Fountain fourteen years ago, and it completely revolutionised what I thought movies were capable of. I often credit it with making me the movie buff I am today. Since then I have watched every single Aronofsky movie, and largely loved all of them. Except Pi, his feature-length debut (and his early shorts). This was mainly because I just couldn't find it anywhere, and when I could it was priced so far out of what was reasonable. I became resigned to the fact it was probably going to be a movie I'll never see. Thank you Amazon for having it available on Prime video.Pi follows Max, a man obsessed with predicting the stock market. He's convinced there's mathematical patterns in everything. During one particular prediction session, his homemade supercomputer crashes after spitting out a 216-digit number. He thinks nothing of it, throws the print-out away, and gets to fixing his computer ready for next time. But it's not long before other people start mentioning a mysterious 216-digit number that could solve the mystery to everything. His mentor mentions the same thing occurred with his computer, and theorised that it found a brief moment of self-awareness before sputtering out. A guy in a coffee shop shows Max a secret code in the Torah, and posits that the key to God is a 216-digit in the religious texts. All the while there's a mysterious Wall Street woman who keeps hounding him to crack it and give them what they need to make a lot of money off the stock market.But there's a catch. Max is not mentally well. He suffers cluster headaches and requires medication to keep them under control. As the movie progresses his mental state deteriorates and he starts hallucinating. It starts to question his reliability as a narrator. Is he a mathematical genius, or just a paranoid schizophrenic with delusion of grandeur? Is the Wall Street woman real or just an aggressive delusion of being followed? Is there really a 216-digit code in the Torah, or is Max just finding patterns and coincidences where there aren't any? Pi evolves into a movie as much about mental illness as it does about unlocking the secrets to the universe by a mathematical pattern.As an Aronofsky aficionado, possibly my favourite thing about watching this movie was seeing where his director tropes and trademarks all began. There's an element of Pi in all his movies, from the fascination with biblical topics (Noah, mother!), to a descent into madness and a depressing ending (Requiem for a Dream, Black Swan), to a search for something beyond human comprehension (The Fountain), to following a single character intimately as they break down (The Wrestler). It's all here. Even filming techniques like relentless close-ups, quick cuts, and a distraction to inanimate objects. Pi has it all. It feels as much like an Aronofsky movie as any other, almost like there was no filmmaking voice for him to find; it's all been there since the beginning.But. But Pi probably ranks as my least favourite Aronofsky movie, for one very simple reason. It's an ugly movie to look at. I understand the reasoning behind it, for sure, but for me it got in the way of the viewing experience rather than enhanced it. Pi is filmed entirely in black and white, with the contrast dialed all the way up. There's barely any grey, there's either light or shadow. It works as an insight into Max's binary state of mind. The world to him is black and white. There's a pattern to it and it can be cracked. But from a moviemaking perspective, it blots out the details. It makes it hard to discern exactly what you're looking at, and causes the film's more frenetic moments to just turn into an indecipherable blur. It wouldn't have been so bad if there wasn't a thick layer of grain over the top of everything, muddying an already lacklustre visual quality. Again it's meant to bring us into Max's world, and be reminiscent of old science experiment footage, but ultimately it just made it harder to watch, in a literal sense. As a counterpoint, Beyond the Black Rainbow sought out the same visual techniques in it's psychedelic sections, but succeeded at it because it didn't get in the way of what was being shown. It remained grainy enough to feel old and creepy, but crisp enough that you could see what was happening, and its use of high-contrast black and white was used to create abstract shapes rather than muddy the details of something we're meant to recognise.Another slight niggle with Pi was the acting quality. For what was ultimately an amateur film, I can't slate it too hard, but the acting performances often come off as first year acting school performances. Sean Gullette shows an apt awkwardness as Max, but often it comes out in the wrong way, delivering lines awkwardly as if he's forgotten them, or is unintentionally unsure what to do with his body. Pamela Hart as the Wall Street woman just feels incredibly off and unnatural, and Samia Shoaib as Max's neighbour looks like she was plucked out of acting school and was trying too hard to make an impression. Mark Margolis and Ben Shenkman are pretty good as the mentor and Jewish guy respectively, so it's no surprise to see them still working today, but Margolis was already an established actor going into this anyway.I am glad I watched Pi, but only to see where it all started for Aronofsky. I enjoyed the story that was being told, and while it's a story that has been done a number of times, Pi found an interesting way to tie it all together and really delve into the insanity this kind of obsession can cause (or the insanity that causes this kind of obsession). The soundtrack is also great, fast-paced and rhythmic mirroring not only Max's frantic state, but also his search for patterns and repetition in everything. Using tracks from the likes of Orbital, Aphex Twin, Massive Attack, and composer Clint Mansell, it makes a surprisingly cohesive soundtrack to listen to on its own terms as well. The acting was awkward but I can forgive that considering the budget and it being a first time, self-financed indie project. But what ultimately let it down for me was the ugly visual aesthetic that often made it too hard to actually discern what was going on. It worked thematically, but just didn't work for me. I give Pi a 7/10; solid, but let down by some superfluous issues.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
the world desperately trying to understand itself.,"Pi is a movie teaming with ideas and self realization. The premise is quite simple in that it is an exploration of a mathematician trying to understand explore the nature of reality. The closer he gets to truth the farther he strays from understanding it. The movie lingers on the golden ratio ( 1.618034 ) found in the Fibonacci sequence (1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987.....) and how this man made creation is one way to understand the world by it's mere presence (percieved or real) everywhere in nature. Several ideas don't even have to be mentioned in the movie to play a part such as quantum mechanics, chaos theory, and the uncertinty pricncipal which have all conspired to bring an end or limitation to the uses of mathematics. The curious idea hardly mentioned in the movie is that computers become self aware working with these complex mathematics and try to understand themselves by which they go mad and shut down all practical functioning. The same can be said of the lead charecter of Max. As he tries to ponder the world he overlook that he is a part of that world and he must ultimately understand himself to understand the world. When he fails to do this he only digs a deeper hole and eventually all the practicalities in life such as eating, sleeping, and human relationships become secondary in importance to him. Darren Aronofsky has made a wonderously intelligent film here. I could have watched another two hours of this and I'll bet it probably would not have slowed down a bit. This is a rare movie that I think even those who respect it will over look how truly great it is. An intricate work of art that has so many philosophical ideas and an under belly of morality that itcould be one of the best movies in the last two decades. I like it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Pi as I saw it,"To think that numbers and mathematics would drive a person crazy is just... well... crazy. Numbers have always been the one thing in life not governed by subjectivity or bias. They are values with no allegiances, affiliations, or ties to anything or anyone. And the math to garner those values is either right or wrong. So, how did Max Cohen (Sean Gullette) go nuts dealing with numbers?That's what ""Pi"" was about; as I saw it. This movie is artsy and at times abstract, so I won't even presume to believe that I fully understood it and that I know exactly what it was about. This is one of those movies where 100 viewers could walk away with 100 different understandings.What I know is that Max Cohen was a brilliant mathematician and he was also mentally unstable. Through the imagery, scenes, and discordant music it was made clear that Max was trying to stay sane while dealing with numbers. He had an OCD that was going to drive him to an early grave. The movie was chaotic madness at times with a sprinkle of sane conversations to keep some of us more ""distracted"" viewers tied to the plot.

Artsy-fartsy garbage at its worst,"I can't believe how badly people can be suckered with pseudo-scientific buzzwords and the fake grandiose look into the human mind. Everything in this movie is fake. It may look deep art if you know nothing about about mathematics or science in general. However, this is pure trash, masquerading as 'high art'. I kept rolling my eyes throughout this movie, which makes Armageddon look like a scientific paper. It completely lost credibility in the first 15 minutes, then went downhill. Yeah, one could say, but this is not about science. Well, it uses science to prove that the idiotic idea of numbers-god-madness thing is a possibility. What an awful, appalling, manipulative piece-of-youknowwhat! Here is the recipe for movies like this:1. Take a premise which 99% of the people won't understand 2. Add a cup of religious fear and/or belief 3. Add a cup of medical condition (mental, if possible) 4. Mix them all together until you get an unrecognizable mess which looks and smells like youknowwhat. 5. Bake it a little (but leave it half-baked). 6. Serve it black and white, grainy so that it looks exotic. Some people will eat it up thinking that it is a rare gourmet treat. It will give them an opportunity to show everyone that they are special, so they will rave about it. (Most will hate it but will join the praising, just to not look 'the stupid, who didn't get it'.) 7. Cash in the awards. (Warning: It's a gamble. You may get a bad rap - see Doom Generation).There are a few movies I hate with a passion. This one tops them all. Too bad I cannot give a negative number in the IMDb voting.

Insanity or genius?,"Aronofsky can be called a great many things, but ""traditional and usual director"" is not one of them. He does an excellent job on this, and it doesn't feel like he made any compromises on this, leading to a film that is not for everyone. That is, undeniably, the way to move towards the medium being art, a form of expression, as opposed to business. This movie can be described as bizarre, but it's never so vague that you can't follow it, and it does have a plot, which develops nicely throughout. I would say that some will find themselves completely disappearing into Cohen's world for about 80 minutes. The cinematography is incredible, and the Snorricam is marvelous. Editing is sharp and spot-on. The music is modern, techno-like, and rather interesting. All of the writing is masterful. The concept is immensely engaging, and this provides food for thought and questions. Every single acting performance is beyond reproach. The DVD features deleted scenes, with the option of hearing Darren's thoughts on them. He and star/script co-author Sean Gullette also have a commentary track each, and they even both speak over the 9 or so minute-long ""behind the scenes montage"". There's a music video, as well, two trailers and a preview for a graphic novel, and finally, the disc holds notes on the actual enigma. All of them are worth the time. There were no subtitles, however. The language is strong, if not overly frequent. There is disturbing content, the potency of it arguably depending on personal tastes.

Conflicting emotions on this movie,"Pi begins with an interesting premise that brings excitement ‚Äì solving a mathematical puzzle which has extensive implications financially, socially and spiritually.

The mathematical theories and explanations were very short and offer the viewer no real additional knowledge or insight (at least to most individuals who have some form of higher education).

Painful to Watch,"On a recommendation, I rented the video 'Pi' and forced myself to watch it, having to stop the video several times.  I think I would have experienced less pain having my wisdom teeth extracted, than watching the 85 minutes of this grainy,  psychedelic mess.  The film tries to be deep and profound, and I'm sure many people buy into it, and will say I missed the point.  Anyone with any knowledge of science in general and is willing to call things like they are, is likely to see how superficial and false the film is.  Thrown together with the gritty, black and white visuals and strange camera angles, is a continuous throbbing techno beat, and the dabble into religious mysticism, medical problems, mathematic theorems, and mental illness.  I'm sure the film makers hoped this mix would make Max's quest for answers and his journey into madness seem a revelation.  I found the film disturbing and slow moving.  However, if you're one that likes to dig for meaning that isn't there and can believe a mainframe computer is made of several keyboards and old TV sets tied together, then by all means see this film.  My only recommendation is don't make the mistake I did; which was seeing this film sober.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Thought-provoking psychological thriller,"Damned good movie... one of the best I've ever seen.If you're a perfectionist, you can pick this film to death, but that exactly misses the point.  There is a great message worked into this movie--that it's easy to miss out on the beauty of life if you focus too finely on any one part of it.  Many people who criticize this movie on this comments board were obviously looking for particular things in Pi instead of appreciating it for its whole, which in my mind is a thought-provoking masterpiece.Better yet, there are dozens of ways the lesson in finding beauty comes across, from the subtle (ant squishing) to the obvious (brain drilling). And although experts in mathematics may find some of the cool math plot devices in this movie to be trite, there are just so many subtleties and layers in the movie waiting to be discovered on the third or fourth viewing.(The kids coming down the spiral staircase as Max gets out his microscope to examine compu-plasm?  Or did anyone bother to calculate the division problem that the little girl asks Max at the end of the movie and contemplate the fact that he's unable to figure it out?  Do the math, and find added irony in the fact that post-epiphany, Max sees the girl's smile, but doesn't recognize pi when it's staring him in the face.)",,Anonymous,Horror

If only for a bigger budget ...,"This movie had a very good concept, good writing (although a little unclear at times), good direction and good acting. The only thing that held back the overall success of the film in my estimation was the financial constraints the makers must have felt when making this film. By that I don't mean they needed more money for special effects and the like; the simplicity of the film was one of its strong points, allowing the viewers to concentrate on the subject matter at hand instead of silly sub-plots. But lack of finances for things most of the movie-going public take for granted, such as state-of-the-art camera equipment, hampered the film in my estimation. This is not to say low budget films can't work; In the Company of Men and Clerks were huge successes despite having budgets less than what some big studios spend on buffet spreads for their stars. But neither of those films needed more advanced technology for chase scenes or rapid action. Both were essentially pieces where the camera was set up in a corner and events in an almost documentary style. Pi lost much of its power and drama in scenes where it was difficult to comprehend the action because of poor cinematography. It's really a shame considering these faults could most likely could have been ironed out for less than what one chase scene in a lame summer action movie costs. What a Catch-22; you have to get big studio attention to make money, but you have to be able to make money before you get money from big studios.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Life is numbers. Numbers have patterns. Find the pattern.,"If you're a math person, a movie like this hits a nerve. If you don't know if you're a math person, you're not.

Acting is not an issue here, as far as the movie is concerned it's not a movie, for all intents and purposes it's a perfect portrayal of what its like to struggle with a puzzle, with the distractions, trying to scrounge as much co-ordination of your mind as you can in hopes that at the peak of your struggle you will be high enough to have reached the goal. There's always a pattern in anything, we know this. Max knows it, and he's searching...If you understand what I'm trying to say, then you need to see this movie. It puts into perspective the importance of numbers in our world. We know certain things to be true... math is the basis of life. No one with a reasonable amount of intelligence can dispute this. Life is not random. How can you dispute that, when the theory of evolution that we so obviously buy into as a species STATES, in more words, that life is not random. There is nothing random about survival of the fittest, is there?

"In 1990s New York City, a numbers theorist may have discovered the ultimate pattern in the universe, which would include the pattern behind the apparent chaos of the stock market, and would be the True NAME","PI is an independently produced art film (Sundance festival winner) that is, generically, an SF mathematical mystery, plus thriller. Summarized by Vince Moore, with editing by Rich Erlich for the CLOCKWORKS-2 PROJECT: a list of WORKS USEFUL FOR THE STUDY OF THE HUMAN/MACHINE INTERFACE IN SF.The significantly named Maximilian-always called ""Max""-Cohen (Kohen Gadol  High Priest = Max. Priest) is a theoretical mathematician who believes in pattern in everything, yet he is still subject to inexplicable and incurable seizures and hallucinations (apparently from some variety of migraine).  He has focused his talents on patterns that may predict complex, apparently chaotic phenomena, with the stock market as his main, purely theoretical, interest. Just before his home-made computer (Euclid) crashes, it spits out some apparently random digits and highly unlikely stock predictions. Cohen throws away the printout and goes to complain to Sol Robeson: his current confidante and Go partner, and apparently Cohen's only male friend (he rejects friendship or even colleagueship with women).  Sol was once Cohen's mentor; and Sol once sought patterns in the transcendental number pi, perhaps finding them and suffering a stroke in consequence-and being wise enough to quit.  (Pi = ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, the ratio itself = 3.1416+ a nonrepeating series that can be extended indefinitely.)  Sol asks if the random number(s) the computer generated contained 216 digits.Cohen is soon told by a Hassidic Jew who works with Biblical numerology that his group of Hassidim are looking for a 216 digit number (which, translated from numbers to Hebrew letters, gives the true NAME-of God).  Simultaneously, an organization combining elements of a think tank, Wall Street brokerage firm, and espionage operation aggressively solicits Cohen's help on stock investments.  Cohen goads Sol to reproduce the 216-digit number, which Sol does, has another stroke, and dies. Sol's earlier theory was that the 216 digit number was the product of computer consciousness as the computer ""died.""PI is significant for the study of the human/machine interface primarily for the imagery of Cohen sitting in the midst of Euclid, which Robert Denerstein, the Scripps-Howard reviewer, saw as ""a giant computer that lines the walls of his apartment like a high-tech web"" (_The Cincinnati Post_, 7 Aug. 1998: 3B).  Euclid is literally a very small main-frame but Denerstein does well to note the web imagery: at the center of the computer, destroying its main chip, are ants, secreting a mucoid substance that ""kills"" Euclid, perhaps bringing it to consciousness and generating the NAME.  Cohen rebuilds his computer, around a superchip supplied by the mysterious Wall Street organization.  The imagery of Cohen inside the computer elements suggests strange juxtapositions of postmodern cybernetic space-but definitely not cyberpunk cyberspace-enclosing the human and insectoid, the natural and secular, along with the ultimately spiritual.  Cohen within his computer may be a new Kohen Gadol in a new Holy of Holies, bringing about the Last Days, in an apocalyptic crash of the stock market, or with the Messianic era.  Or he's another mad scientist, another nut venturing into areas reserved for High Priests or Messiah.Cf. and contrast Arthur C. Clarke's 1953 short story, ""The Nine Billion Names of God,"" wherein computers are used to list God's 9 billion names, at which time the work of the universe, and the universe, is finished (collected in Clarke's THE NINE BILLION NAMES OF GOD [New York: Signet-NAL, 1967]).",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Some of the cinematography is fantastic, though the grainy images start to wear after a while, and the soundtrack is outstanding. Ignore the holes in the plot, and the occasional implausability, and feel the obsession, the paranoia and fear and you'll probably enjoy it a lot more.If you have to view it on video do yourself a favour and make sure it is on a big screen, with a decent and loud home theatre set up, with the room dark and the phone off the hook.

"Overrated, silly sci-fi movie","I still can't believe all the people who tell me they love this movie.  To me, it is the best possible example of style taking over a film, because this is a film with no real substance:  instead of a plot, we are simply supposed to believe that this guy has gone insane because of math (with a bunch of pictures from some book to illustrate the possibility) and that he's being chased by mad yiddish people.  This is so silly I don't even know how to say it.  There are so many fevered dream type sequences that they lose any impact their dynamic visual style gives them by the end of the film.I was not surprised to see that older voters on IMDB have not rated this film so highly -- they have seen enough movies with quality and substance to know when the director's just putting a mickey over on the audience.  Most older people also appreciate it when a movie actually has a story.

Scientific Personality Disorder,"This movie chronicles the most severe case of scientific personality disorder (SPD) I have ever seen. ""What is SPD?"" you might ask. This is a disorder of scientists where science becomes everything to them. In his case, he sees swirls of creamer in his coffee as chaos theory...number theory, as math. In biological circles, we see all human behavior as either neurochemistry or an attempt to gain an evolutionary advantage. The good ones can see both. Some may say SPD makes scientists great. After all, Einstein had trouble remembering his own phone number. Most scientists I talk to see it as a struggle just to remain a normal human being. It is a struggle to be able to communicate with others without giving the perception you are looking at an alien. You have trouble even feeling comfortable in daily, non-scientific interpersonal communication. A mathematician, while deep in thought about a particular theorem, may see his own wife walk through the door and ask, ""Who are you?"" (True story!) For those scientists who care about being functional members of society, they do everything they can to not fall into this permanently. Our protagonist in this movie, has severe SPD. SEVERE! How do you liberate yourself from that once you have fallen in? I promise you, you could never imagine what he thinks of.Mathematically speaking, he falls across something that was absolutely outstanding. He can finally explain all reality through Pi.

A Journey into Mathematical Madness,"1) Mathematics is the language of nature2) Everything around can be understood and represented through numbers3) If you graph the numbers of any system, patterns will emerge.These are the three fundamental assumptions that Maximilian Cohen, a genius mathematician has of our universe. He believes that patterns exist everywhere in nature; in disease epidemics and even the rise and fall of the Nile. Math is everywhere, even in the swirls that cream makes when you pour it in your coffee, or in the billows of smoke from a cigarette. Maximilian states that even Leonardo DaVinci penciled the ""golden rectangle"" into his masterpieces which generated the mythical ""golden spiral"". Pythagoras saw this spiraling shape everywhere in nature including our finger prints and DNA strands. This, Maximilian thinks is the basis for all understanding. There is a recurring motif of circular composition to reinforce this. For example, there are many shots in which Maximilian looks out the peep-hole on the front door of his apartment. When he does this, we not only see what is outside the door, but we see what is outside the door through the circular border of the peep-hole. This spiraling effect is also created in camera movement. Most notably, in one scene Maximilian is standing on a crowded street, and the camera begins to circle around him quite rapidly (circle dolly, or crab dolly).""Pi"" is a journey into the Maximilian's mind as he struggles furiously to find the meaning of our world in terms of mathematical patterns. Theoretically, if one can explain everything through patterns, then he or she can explain the essence of even ""God"". But the real question is whether we as human beings are really capable of understanding the true essence of life. We can see that Maximilian is going more and more mad, the closer that he 'thinks' he is getting to the truth. He knows that he is close to the truth, but that he just can't quite grasp ahold of it. It may be true that in theory everything can be explained in terms of mathematical patterns, but in reality, perhaps we just don't have the intellectual capacity to do so. If we attempt such as colossal feat, perhaps it will lead us to madness.The cinematography and editing of ""Pi"" are impeccable. It is filmed in a grainy, black&white fashion, and is essentially chaotic. Much of the film is done with the hand-held camera, showing jerky movements.  'Chaos Theory' suggests that we can find mathematical patterns in even the most chaotic and seemingly unstructured elements of the world. The chaotic filming techniques greatly reflect Maximilian's search for truth. Our world is chaotic, and he is trying to make sense of it through any mathematical patterns that he can find. I found myself asking if there is any continuity or pattern to the editing and camera work. Director, Darren Aronofsky quite likely wants us to ask that question. There are certain patterns that can be followed, and many that can not, at least through human intellectualization. The mathematically precise beats of the electronic music soundtrack also set a beneficial mood to the film, reflecting to an even higher degree that patterns exist in everything, and that, as Maximilian states in his assumptions, ""Mathematics is the language of nature.""**** out of 4",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

An impressive feature debut from Aronofsky,"""When your mind becomes obsessed with anything, you will filter everything else out and find that thing everywhere.""Darren Aronofsky's first feature film, Pi, was a unique and experimental movie that cemented his status as an auteur director. Even in his latest big budget film, Noah, his unique and creative voice shined through. Just like his characters, Aronofsky seems obsessed with discovering what drives them. His films are a psychological character study in which he delves deep into their minds in order to try to discover what leads them to their self destructive behavior. In the surface, Pi may sound like a boring film dealing with math and numbers, but Aronofsky sucks you in from the beginning with his very unique style of film making including some crazy chase scenes shown in fast motion and a strange soundtrack. The cinematography in dirty black and white sets the tone of the film as well, although I didn't find it quite engaging. It's amazing what Aronofsky did with such a low budget and it won him special recognition. He won for best director in Sundance in 1998 and an Independent Spirit Award for his first screenplay. He also proved Pi was no one hit wonder as his following films were all received with warm praise by the critics. Aronfofsky's unique personal vision is reflected in each one of his films and if you go back to Pi you will find several similarities and trademarks that were already established from the beginning. If Pi were my first film from Aronofsky I might have enjoyed it even more, but I think he has perfected his craft in films like Black Swan and The Wrestler.The screenplay written by Darren Aronofsky and Sean Gullette centers on a mathematical genius named Max (Sean Gullette). He's a number theorist who believes that nature can be explained through numbers and that there are patterns that can emerge from it. He is working on discovering these pattern through the stock market and considering all the variables involved. He works in his home through a homemade computer he has developed. He locks himself in his small apartment and becomes obsessed with discovering these patterns while also worrying that people are spying on him. He suffers from terrible headaches that sometimes lead him to delusions so he is currently on medication and at times its hard to decipher if he is really seeing things or imagining them. One of the few people Max interacts with is Sol (Mark Margolis) who is his former math mentor. He worries about Max's obsession and asks him to take a break, but Max is determined to discover the pattern that could unlock the mysteries of nature. The other person who Max interacts with is Lenny (Ben Shenkman), a Jew who is currently working on the numbers from the Torah. As Max becomes more and more obsessed with unlocking these numbers the crazier things get for him.I really enjoyed this film despite the fact that I knew where it was heading. Although his characters are very different in every film the resolution is very similar and the ending is always open ended for the audience to interpret. Pi marked the beginning of Aronofsky's love affair with Mark Margolis who has been in every one of his film as a secondary character. He was the only face I recognized in this film as I was unfamiliar with the rest of the cast. Sean Gullette gives a very convincing lead performance but the rest of the cast aren't as great. You could tell Aronofsky had a very limited budget to work with, but he did marvels with it. Pi is a clever film with some memorable scenes. I never thought a film about math and numbers could be so thrilling, but it is because Aronofsky manages to put the character in the center and turns it into a psychological character study.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
This mumbojumbo  made me angry,"This film is total mumbojumbo crap. You can't understand nature by looking at just one specific number and that a part from this isn't really that important for nature. pi is just pi there is nothing behind it, is's geometry. There are more import constants i.e. h ( Heisenberg constant). If you want to understand or describe nature then you have to use physics and use math. Both are strongly interconnected now a days. This is actually a fact that everyone knows. They could at least have adopted ""Fermats Last Theorem"" by Simon Singh to make a good and believable movie about a mathematician's live.This brings up the second thing that I disliked: the clich√© of the obsessed math nerd. Usually mathematicians are enjoying their work and they aren't more or less obsessed than anybody else who loves what he/she is doing. Why is nobody filming a positive and realistic film about scientists or mathematicians. I mean there are enough groundbreaking scientists out there. Just take Einstein, Fermi, Heisenberg, Euler or even take some string-theorists... All of them are trying hard to understand how nature works. Besides without Einstein and others no filmmaker could use all the fancy digital/analog filmediting stuff they usually use, so they should give those guys some respectfull tribute instead of this mockerish portrait.

I sat on the couch for about 20 minutes just pondering on what I thought happened and discussing it with myself in my mind. Honestly, I had never been so intrigued since Donnie Darko.The whole entire movie was played in black and white which I feel helped the mood of the movie. Maxamillian is a disclosed, paranoid man and I think black and white was the only way to make the audience feel what he feels when he went ""insane"". What made the movie so mind-blowing to me was that this could easily be a real event. People go insane everyday. Why can't it be that they found something that has enlightened them?

Thank goodness for small budgets and confined spaces.,"The movie ""Pi"" has to be one of the better movies I have seen this year, which goes to show that maybe James Cameron should rethink his ""Does this mean bigger is better?"" idea.  I am very happy that this movie only had a budget of $60,000, for, if it had more, the art of it might have been lost.The black and white of it is marvelous.  Mathematics is mostly black and white, there are no shades very often, just straight cut with definitiveness. It also lends the surrealistic view of every place that Max visits.  His home, lined with spidery webs of wire and equipment, the city, which is shown with sped-up footage, and also the subway, which lends a sort of simplistic view of the life under the city.Also, I found that the metaphors were seen with ease, and therefore, aiding to the enjoyment of the film all the more.  Another thing I liked about the movie was the patterns in the actual film.  Many things repeated: Max's pill-popping, his daily notes, the work on the computer, etc. . .  It was all just masterfully constructed.Although the movie does have it's ""yeah right"" idea's (such as, would this all powerful number be ONLY 216 digits long, and why would Max be one of the FIRST to find it?)

Jon Monsarrat review:  not bad but too surreal,"PI was a little too surreal and low-budget ($60,000) to compete with the blockbusters (it's in black & white), but when you consider what they did for next to nothing it's quite impressive.Without spoiling the story for you, a mathematician discovers something about mathematics that connects deeply with people. Considering that charts and graphics are quite stale, the movie builds this mathematical insight into a crescendo of frenzy and the film becomes an eerie yet fascinating psychological thriller. The film is disturbing on a par with ""Silence of the Lambs"", although it is not actually a horror film and nowhere near as bad as ""Eraserhead"", a surreal vision of hell which I only caught a few minutes of and still haunts me.Who should see this film:-- sci-fi lovers with a little arty to them, but definitelynot kids or people who get nightmares easily. It is rated R for ""some disturbing images"", and they ain't kidding, although the film does not involve blood and gore.-- drama / artistic types who won't mind when the surrealitygoes Whamo! Whamo!

An effective psychological thriller masquerading as science fiction,"I just want to amplify what others have touched on.  This movie is not so much about its subject matter as its subject -- that is, it's about poor, obsessed, half-crazy Max and not about computers or number theory.  So the computer he uses looks lower-tech than a TRS-80.  So the chip he uses has only four pins, and magically fits into the socket he's already designed for it.  If you dwell on the details, you'll lose sight of the brilliance of the movie.The camera work, soundtrack and mania of the lead character all work together to make a gripping, tooth-grinding psychological drama.  You are left with two opposite but alternative interpretations that center around the old professor's warning about his obsession warping his view of reality.Was the professor concealing the truth to protect Max from his own discoveries, or was the professor warning Max against letting his obsession cloud his thinking?The movie is full of subtleties that can fit either interpretation equally well.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

THIS won an award?!?!,"This movie SUCKED! It took 90 minutes of my life that I'll never get back, and for what? Some really bad acting, and zero plot. As a physicist, I expected at least a modicum of insight about mathematics to be discussed in this movie. Instead, it was all fluff and psychobabble. There was no real point to this movie. The guy didn't even portray a schizophrenic very well.The protagonist kept talking about looking for structure in the stock market, which is a chaotic system. This is hardly an original idea. People have tried to apply structural models to the market, but the market responds to such stimuli by changing in unpredictable ways, so that the rules upon which models are built are no longer valid. Any decent mathematician (and our protagonist is supposed to be a genius) would've already known this. Oh well, no one expects movie makers to have any real brains, anyway, right?But this movie didn't compensate its lack of mathematical intrigue with ANYTHING else - it was just a bunch of meaningless dialog between characters too shallow to be even worth caring about - that is, when the viewer wasn't being subjected to miles of footage of the protagonist picking his nose (literally!), or some equally idiotic and boring behavior.As far as movies concerning math, a MUCH BETTER movie is ""A Beautiful Mind.""

Destined to become a cult classic.,"Rarely does one see a film so well crafted that the viewer does not know where the transition from reality to surrealism begins.Rarely also is a film so well researched and accurate.The mathematical premises offered in the film are entirely correct and the mysteries surrounding this number have existed for centuries. I used to subscribe to a magazine called mathematical PI and each page would have the latest calculated decimal places printed across the bottom of each page. The references to the Pythagoreans are also accurate.For those non-maths people, PI is the fraction of 22 over 7, is used in the calculation of the area of a circle and comes into every branch of maths, particularly electronics. The fraction, when divided out into a decimal does not resolve into a precise number, the decimal places do not re-occur. Mathematicians have in fact spent years looking for a pattern in the millions of numbers, which the decimal places give us but have found no answer.American-Indian culture recognized that all things in nature are round which was why their tents were round (like the moon and sun). In fact, if you look in nature you will not see a single straight line. The film recognizes this and looks for a pattern in life/nature which PI could hold the clue to.The decent into madness is entirely understandable and is exceptionally well filmed; it literally does take the viewer along.Destined to become a cult classic - see it.",,Anonymous,Horror
Darren Aronosfky doesn't disappoint,"Pi is an overlooked little masterpiece. Using the tricky subject of mathematics and combining it with heavy black and white footage, drug abuse, Lynchean moodiness and untested actors and still coming out with a great movie is an achievement, especially considering the movie had a budget smaller than the price of a good car.The actors are all unknowns, unless you regularly watch Aronofsky. The lead is very convincing and a treat to watch as he spirals into the scary world of number-obsessed big fish. His mentor is a lovely albeit stereotypical foreigner, well played by Mark Margolis. Supporting cast varies, as is expected, but on average excellent.The movie is shot in black and white, with contrast cranked up on max, and it looks surprisingly good. The ""effects"" look lovely and though simple they are very effective. Some dark scenes are too dark but everything with lights looks gorgeous.The story is fast-moving and never dull, and there is a lot of well-built tension and awe-inspiring scenes. There are no jump scenes but plenty of scary and powerful moments. Warning, it WILL make you think.And last but not least, the MUSIC! Pi features a perfect soundtrack, so suited the movie even Tarantino can't brag next to it. When Massive Attack came on, I decided this was indeed an awesome movie. Lots of great(and suitable) techno, electronic and even stranger music. Not a soundtrack worth buying, but man, does it make the movie work.So all in all, Pi is a great late-night movie, can be enjoyed on your own and must be shown in pitch dark. Enjoy this lovely slice of weirdness.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best movies I've ever seen.,"I rarely take the time to fill out this sort of thing, but after reading a few of the harsher reviews of this movie, I felt the need to at least throw in a few comments.This is a fantastic movie: part scifi, part thriller, part psychological drama and part it's own brand-new genre... all with a very unique story line. The gritty camera work aligns perfectly with the music to make a whole far superior to the sum of the parts.I've seen some criticism of the portrayal of Jews in this film, but I can only assume it comes from those who didn't pay much attention. This is fiction, told from a very paranoid perspective... no one comes off looking good from that point of view.I can't wait to see what Darren Aronofsky does next.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Just a Thought,"I watched ""Pi"" for the first time in a number of years yesterday, and I was struck with a reference that I had never noticed before.In Max's first meeting with Sol over the Go board, Sol asks Max whether he had gotten around to reading ""Hamlet"" (which Saul had previously recommended, presumably). It can't just be coincidence that ""Hamlet"", like ""Pi"", is ALSO about a ""haunted"" young intellectual who THINKS TOO MUCH.Both Shakespeare's play and Aronovsky's film deal with the frustrations of trying to understand the fundamentally-irrational through the use of reason. In Hamlet's case, it means trying to reconcile a supernatural call for vengeance with Rationalist philosophy. In Max's case, it means trying to reduce all of Nature - even the True Name of God! - to a mathematical principle. Both Hamlet and Max are driven to (beyond?) the edge of sanity by their labors.So Sol's recommendation that Max read ""Hamlet"" is not merely to give him something to take his mind off his work, but is in fact a veiled warning against the path he sees Max heading out on.PS: I also wonder if it's a coincidence that Max's mentor is named ""Sol""; Max is too close to ""the sun"", after all.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Vision,"The movie was great, a little strange but great. The only issue I had with it was that it was a little hard on the eyes...contrast was set to high. This made viewing a little painful. I plan to get another copy of it in the future since the VHS tape I had became damaged in an apartment fire. The acting was superb and the dialog was easy to understand. I didn't feel as if it was an insult to mathematicians at all. The fact of the matter is that it seemed to have a basis rooted in fact, namely the number of letters; 128 I believe; for the name of God. I've read this somewhere, in a book on Jewish mysticism...I think it was in the Kabbala (Cabala) or the Sephir Yazorat. Please forgive my misspellings. It may have been something that Eliphas Levi wrote in a book. I've failed to see any connection with Wall Street in the movie with the name of God.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Nutshell Review: (DVD) Pi (1998),"Darren Aronofsky shot to prominence with this relatively low budgeted movie which looks like it has a million dollars ploughed into its production. It's inspiring to see how this black and white film dwells on science fiction so effortlessly, given its very simple plot.Long time Aronofsky collaborator Sean Gullette plays Max Cohen, a mathematician who's looking for patterns amidst chaos. He is determined to predict and look for patterns in stock markets, and comes dangerously close to a solution until his computer Euclid, breaks down. During his quest to uncover and recover what Euclid produced before it broke down, he comes across a religious Kabbalah cult, as well as a pesky banker, who is more than meets the eye.Those with a slight interest in mathematics might also get a kick out of watching how maths can feature and get filmed stylistically in a film like this. Like the Fibbonacci sequence, and how the Kabbalah texts can be represented by numbers. Some numerology also makes its way into the narrative. It's interesting to note how a simple story is able to accommodate these various subplots with ease, and how they all are brought together to make it visually arresting.The cast is relatively small, and much hinges on Gullette's portrayal as a lonely, and sick man who's bordering on the edge of madness (don't most geniuses?). Most of the supporting characters are played by family and friend\s of the filmmakers too.Accompanied by a great soundtrack, this Code 1 DVD also comes with plenty of extras, like deleted scenes, separate audio commentaries by Aronofsky and Gullette, production notes, trailers and a music video. It is substance combined with style.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Science fiction or incoherent garbage?,"This review is for those of you who are fans of science fiction, who are sitting on the fence, deciding whether or not to view this film after hearing such great reviews for it. If you are in this category, please read! Do not make the same mistake that I did. I purchased Pi and Requiem for a Dream (the director's next film), solely based on the ratings they received here.Director Darren Aronofsky is not interested in telling a story. There is indeed a silly plot; however, it is more of a concept, a framework for the director to shape his ""cinematic modern art"" around. I have no problem with the fact that the idea of finding a universal constant is ludicrous; such outlandish ideas are often the back-bone of sci-fi classics. In fact, had the director made an honest attempt to tell a story, the film could have been quite captivating. Instead we are left with a mess that will literally assault the viewer and make them nauseous.We are treated to close-up after close-up of the protagonist popping pills, seemingly one of the director's trademark effects. Chase sequences in which the camera shakes violently; when combined with the ultra-contrasting black and white nature of the film, it has a strobe light effect. In addition we are subjected to high-pitched, ear-piercing pitches and tones (much like that of a modem or fax machine) which signify his insanity, and a telephone that will not stop ringing.Discussing the plot beyond this is pointless. The math is secondary at best. The real focus here is that the main character is going insane and this gives the director the opportunity to portray that insanity through art-full direction.Example: Several times during this film the main character is working at his computer, entering data. He states that he must now hit the ""Enter"" key to see the results. If successful, the computer will display this magic number. *Each time* his finger hovers over the ""Enter"" key for a long length of time but he does not press it, *each time* he goes into psychopathic fits. The viewer sits thinking ""just push the damn button already!!!""Conclusion? This is an obscure, sophomoric, amateur, style over substance film. THE single worst film that I have ever seen. 1 out of 10 and that's being kind! You have been warned.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Wonderful film...,"To be honest, there isn't much more I can add to what the previous contributor has so eloquently put. However I will say, this movie is an example of something which cerebral film-making can achieve. It is a film which can be appreciated in terms of it's film noire qualities as well as the existential questions which it awakens, but never seeks to answer. This film is a classic, and truly inspires you to investigate and postulate upon the mathematical conundrum that may (or may not) define the universe in which we live...",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pi's marriage of the purely mathematical to the purely spiritual...,"The mirror Pi. A sentient energy. This movie does what most truly great films can: turns a viewer's gaze on himself. What one sees he sees because it suits him; this is the consequence of the Interpretive Film's dance.He is horrified, he is frazzled, he is awe-stricken. But why? Since the question will certainly differ--as a number of people will see a film--analyses will differ.  It is no wonder a variety of opinions can emerge from a theatrical screening, not to mention multiple ones.In my opinion another thing done right is Pi's marriage of the purely mathematical to the purely spiritual. It refuses to polarize at either and avoids a paradox of the sort found in bipartisan politics, or any instition founded on duality, which ignores the apparent oneness of things; of man's being the fountainhead, the outpouring, of the life force. And so Pi charges the viewer to look no further than himself, for answers.It is no coincidence that Pi ends on an interpretive note.My only direct reference to the film invokes the scene in which an ant is perched on the wall next to Max's stock ticker. I was reminded of some old textbook illustrations from school I've seen of prisms and their effects on light. The ant beside the ticker looks as thought it might be a prism, spewing forth information on stocks--the ""living system"" of which Max so often speaks--a kind of life force.Therefore, it is this viewer's opinion that, symbolically, Max's committing suicide is a result of his inability to find answers within him--his persistence in trying to find them, externally, to such an extent that he forgets that he and his world ARE precisely the same energy--and a disastrous method of marrying himself to his world again.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brilliant!,"Glad to see a wonderfully executed film about something intellectual. A nice departure from the usual repetitive sex, eating, violence and other common themes emerging from the animalistic, instinctual aspects of human existence. This very jewish film (one of the best together with Barton Fink and Miller's Crossing) is about the quest for the truth. Understanding of the patterns of complex systems. It seemed like the writers are somewhat familiar with the set and chaos theory. Brilliant mathematician Max Cohen suffers from debilitatingly severe headaches and truly reminds of many brilliant mathematicians like Kurt Godel and one of the founders of fractal mathematics Mitchell Feigenbaum in his avoidance of people and ultimate dedication to his vocation. He believes like most ingenious scientists before him that universe exhibits patterns and these patterns can be quantified and understood in the language of mathematics. He pursues finding a definite answer to the workings of the stock market, thus stumbling on a numerical code to the processes of the universe. A code linking together spirality and  the golden rule of geometry meaning the fractality of nature and the concept of self-similarity.He detests petty materialists and finds the orthodox jews looking for a password to god silly and mistaken in their interpretation of the code.Many things are left vague in the process, but the idea, photography, black and white world of the mathematician and the film, editing and drum and bass music the director Darren Aronofsky uses are just brilliant.The mathematician reminds of the obsessed scientist ready to risk and curtail his life to find the understanding to the ultimate questions. He is very similar to the unconditional seeker in Ken Russel's Altered States. An intelligent film for a change. Thanks to filmmakers for that!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
This could have been a masterpiece,"When i first saw Pi i was sucked into the dark mood the the director sets up in such a great way. But something was bugging me.After the second time i understood that although it is a really good movie (considering direction lighting music etc) it has basically great flaws as to its core plot. The whole mathematics thing doesn't make sense at all,the number Pi has nothing to do with the ""key"" number max was looking for (thus making the movie's title just stupid) and the Kabbala numerology is completely flawed.Aronofsky showed great craftsmanship while directing this movie but the impression i get is that he had absolutely no idea about mathematics or mysticism and he didn't bother to do a little research before shooting the film.Too bad this impression gets worse with every viewing when you've stopped being shocked by the imagery and you notice the plot more.This could have been a masterpiece.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

So I'm saying the film is real; some people, however, take their interests over the edge.I found the presentation to be a bit too arty, though, perhaps to elide the weaknesses in the plot.

Avoid,"PI is one of the few movies where I have walked out in boredom part-way thru the showing.

The best math oriented movie I've seen,"To say that Pi is a movie about mathematics is inaccurate. It is a movie about a mathematician and his struggle to balance his eccentric scientific genius with his hidden desire to be a ""normal"" person. The mathematical ideas contained in the film are elementary and unimportant, but the window Aronofsky gives the moviegoer into the mind of a creative mathematician is inspiring.As a professional mathematician myself, I must say that Pi gives more insight into the struggle of a creative mathematician than ""A Beautiful Mind"" or ""Good Will Hunting"". By comparison, those films are formulaic Hollywood drivel, while Pi is a much more thoughtful, exciting, and insightful film. I'm not saying this because I'm an independent movie snob. In fact, I rarely see indie films. I am, however, a math snob. I don't have patience for movies that portray mathematicians and scientists as super-heroes or idiot savants. Pi avoids this trap by pointing a microscope towards the true eccentricities of mathematicians without glamorizing or stereotyping.I often find myself in awkward social situations with smart but not mathematically inclined people. In their best efforts to find common ground, they often mention films like ""A Beautiful Mind"". I'll patiently listen to them as they do their best to fain interest in my life's passion, waiting for them to stop so I can change the topic. But if I get the sense that they sincerely want to understand what the pursuit of applied mathematics is like, I recommend that they see ""Pi"" as a counterpoint to the Hollywood clich√©.I would not recommend this movie to anyone hoping to learn about mathematics, that isn't it's purpose. I do highly recommend this movie to any open-minded person who is friends with, married to, a sibling of, or a parent of a mathematician. I would also highly recommend this movie to any eccentric person with a strongly driven passion, whether it be for math, physics, or dancing. This movie shows the darker side of the creative struggle in a way that is somewhat exaggerated but still very honest.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
psychological thriller combining the truth of the world(maths),"at first when i heard there was a film out like that i didn't give any notice to it...When i got my hands on it, was when i realized it wasn't any ordinary American movie.The movie starts off, displaying the mathematicians profile and his obsession to ''the theory of numbers'' he becomes so psyched with computers and his knowledge that puts down in action so as to discover PI, a 216 digit number that will reveal the truth of the world the truth of our existence or however it is being interpreted through this film.These numbers will reveal the true name of a Jewish God.Remarkable is to say, that the mathematician himself bears a Jewish name...So in the struggle of figuring out this number,he suffers from chronical diseases and so as to survive he pumps up himself taking pills, using syringes that will let him calm down on his research... Last but not least on his way to finding this number is so baffled that he can't even believe if this is for real or not. He gets acquainted with other ppl that want to take advantage of his mind on finding the number that he will soon find out why they want this number.

The Beginning of a Pattern,"1.I'll start off by saying this. First, this is a film for people trying more then to be just entertained. Second, this is not the kind of film you can watch once and get entirely.2.This film was made on a very low budget, with grainy black and white photography. The editing is fast paced, as is most of the music. the sounds are loud and often unnerving, and some of the images shown are meant to be weird/ disturbing when seen for the first time. This film is RAW.3.The plot is open to interpretation. This put together with the style is what I liked most about the film. You might not know at times whether you are watching the main character's dream, an illusion, or a twisted reality. You are expected to come to your own conclusion, and your own idea about what each event and character represents throughout the film. Every scene in the film counts. There's not a scene that doesn't have some meaning or question to move the plot forward. The film demands attention.4.Other films like this are: Enemy,Take Shelter, and Taxi Driver. If you have tried these films and do not like them, I would not recommend Pi. Also, if you did not like some of the other films Darren Aronofsky has made, I would not recommend this film.5. Much like the film suggests, I think that this film shows the beginning of a pattern. The unique style and metaphorical plots of Darren Aronofsky's films started here. Requiem for A Dream, The Fountain, Black Swan, and Noah are some of his other films which have the same style of story telling. This was the beginning of a golden spiral.6. If you watched the film already, you'll find this review is an inside joke, and a silly one at that. If you have not watched this film yet and are planning on it, don't worry. you'll get it.

Mindless pap under the guise of intellectual indie.,"Last night I was subjected to Pi, and subjected is definitely the right word. I have never been a big fan of the more indie/artsy film, and this film was in serious danger of disappearing up the director's own bottom, it was self-adulation to the point of obscurity and a complete waste of my time.Man seeks a golden 216 digit number that holds the key to existence, it sounds like it had the potential to be quite interesting....maaaaaaan, how wrong could I have been? From the moment this film began it was confusing, the wobbly camera work was annoying, the music and sound effects grated on my nerves. There may have been a plot but it was hidden very well under a lot of obscure badly edited, badly acted scenes I believe that actors and directors should continually push back the boundaries of what constitutes art but someone has to moderate these lunatics, Pi it seems slipped through the net. This sort of film appeals to the Pseudo-Intellectual who sits spell bound and declares to have had some Damastine revelation about the world or their life as a result of seeing this work of 'absolute genius.' They are, of course, lying....there is nothing clever about this film, there is nothing redeeming about it in any way at all. The $60,000 would have been better spent hiring a few helicopters and flying the cast and crew into a mountain at 80mph.If you want a clever, evocative and original film with a slightly off-mainstream appeal then try 'Memento', a highly under rated work with clever twists turns and plot. If you want to don your Pseudo-Intellectual glasses and be baffled for two hours by mindless pap expunged from the head of a talentless writer then this might just be the film for you.I gave this film 1/10 and I feel quite strongly that I was being far too generous.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

The truth is that it's just a low-budget thriller, filmed in black and white. The script is pretty good and the direction is okay, although it does slip into the realms of pretentiousness a couple of times. Overall, it's a decent film, with some interesting ideas, but nothing particularly profound.

"Interesting, daunting, compulsive","I do not consider myself a math-head. So some of the things in this flick were a bit daunting for me. But along the way in the movie the bottomline of the story is explained just enough to have me follow the story of this manic-compulsive man who is trying to find the solution to the universe through pi (3.14.....).The writer of this story has created a world comprised of numerology, mathemetics, jew religion, wall street that is so kinetic is its portrayal that it was sometimes a little too much. The editing is extremely fast, the black&white footage is gorgeous. The photography had a real Eraserhead (David Lynch, 1977) feel to it. The soundtrack was absolutely awesome for techno music lovers like me.The length of the movie seemed in the beginning a bit short, 80 minutes, but it seemed right in the end. Through the extremely fast editing and the sheer complexity of the story I don't think people will be able to handle more of this in a single viewing.This movie is certainly not for everybody, but the people who do like it should view it several times to get the whole story.

Interesting...,"if you like something different. I finally made it through this movie on my 3rd or so attempt.I feel like I am generous giving this film a 6, mainly based on effort. It is unique in a lot of ways. I guess since it is an indie (and produced on such a low budget), this allows the director to take chances. Being unique and innovative is good, but if it doesn't help in communicating to the audience, then it fails. The gritty black and white imagery, the quick cutting of shots, the shakiness of the camera in some parts add to the movie in some parts, but get rather tiring and repetitive after a while. Also, I'm a firm believer that you have to root for the protagonist to have an enjoyable movie, and there was basically nothing to make me root for him. It should be possible to build a paranoid character who people can empathize with, but this was not the case with Pi.So kudos to the director for taking chances... But that doesn't mean it was an enjoyable movie.Based on the way the movie was filmed, it can be considered timeless (ie, not set in any specific time period). I found the computer set up a bit overdone, but perhaps if it was supposed to be in the 70s or so, I can understand. I found the line about computers gaining consciousness before shutting down a bit much. I've wondered what mathematicians felt about this movie. I suppose positively since there are not many movies where the protagonist is a mathematician.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't ask me pi,"The spiral leads both into and out of the center. Penetrating the universe is animalistic and intellectual. Bugs are literal, digital, and figurative. Symmetry is beauty and nihilism. Humans are eccentric and concentric. 3.14 does have an end, but holds no mystery because pi is the wrong question to the right answer.The protagonist of Pi lurches closer and closer to the edge, closer to an answer, and closer to annihilation. The viewer experiences something analogous, often feeling as though the solution to, or at least some understanding of, this enigmatic film is just within our grasp, only to have it perpetually beyond our reach, like a heat mirage on the road, or a word just on the tip of our tongue, or an ant believing it can actually roll the sugar cube into its mound.Undoubtedly, some people will find Pi pretentious or frustratingly ambiguous. Having seen it a couple of times decades apart, my younger self liked the film but found it mystifying, a little frustrating, but also enthralling. My reaction the second time was a satisfying giving myself over to and embracing of the obliqueness and ambiguity.One of the most striking aspects of the movie is its conclusion. Part of it seems inevitable, and part of it is surprising and uncharacteristic of Aronofsky's later films. I'm not going to say how, lest I give something away, but the ending is fascinating in how it meshes with and yet contrasts with everything that precedes it.To me, this is a truly great film; that greatness achieved through image and imagery, mad editing and camera work, and compelling performances.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

As soon we're told about the topic of the movie (the whole creation can be put in an equation) ,we eagerly wait for what's following.And there's the rub: religious speculations -Admittedly,people like me who do not know  the Torah certainly cannot understand all the subtleties of the script-abound and drown the maths out.And however the mathematical topic was enthralling .The Fibonacci series was a great idea,because we find it in the nature.And pi is really an universal number,since it appears in the bell curve formula ,queen of the probability.Outside beautiful shots,it left the spectator unsatisfied.It leads to nowhere.The ending is merely a repetition of what we learned at the beginning.The thriller side is botched.The black and white cinematography ,granular and dirty ,recalls that of David Lynch's ""Eraserhead"",an indie too at the time.The brain does too.The mathematical movie remains to be done.",,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best underground films,"I try to measure all films by the same scale. I do not care that much if it took 60,000 $ or 60,000,000 $ to make a movie. At the end of the day I will probably pay the same price for the ticket, or DVD rental, and it will take the same 90 minutes of my precious and too short life to see it. What I care about is the emotion, or the intellectual pleasure I took from watching the film. According to this criteria 'Pi' gets an 8 out of 10 on my personal scale.However, one cannot refer to this movie without taking into account that it was made with the lowest budget possible nowadays - a real underground or garage movie if you want. Do not look for smart expensive effects here. Even the computer equipment looks like eightish, although the film was made in 98. The cheap production, the black and white filming gives the whole movie an atmosphere of roughness and sincerity and lets us viewers focus on the story. And the story - well, the story is original and strong. Finding a common mathematics pattern in nature, economy, God has always been the ideal for many geniuses and lunatics. It is hard to say to what category does the main character belong. He gets close to the supreme mathematic or maybe metaphysics truth - at the same time he gets deeper and deeper in what seems to be the darkness of obsession and madness. The films succeeds with that little means to provoke so deep thoughts to the empathic viewer about science, and truth, and madness, and being different, and refusing to plat within the rules of the society.The director, Darren Aronofsky seems to be one of the most original directing voices today. I admire him  for not giving up to the temptations of commercial cinema. If and when he does it, I hope he will not do something like 'Blair Witch Project 2', nor 'Matrix 2/3', but rather keep expressing the strong and original voice he lets us hear in 'Pi'.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"OBSESSION, PARANOIA AND MATH!!!","Pi is an indie film written and directed by Darren Aronofsky. Showcasing the life and personality of one brilliant, gifted mathematician Max Cohen.Particularly his obsession for finding that one true pattern of life that we aren't too sophisticated to be aware of.He looks for patterns in nature, in the stock market, in the value of Pi, in anything. While dealing with seizures that come from time to time.The film is shot in black and white purposefully to give it a minimalist and authentic look, most shots linger on our protagonist giving us a sense of paranoia and claustrophobia which suitably depicts the character's mindset.The supporting characters include a greedy stock market group , religious fanatics and neighbors and in true Requiem For A Dream fashion some of them are hallucinations.The film showcases a comparison between the err of humanity and its strive for perfection and absolute control. Like Cohen's determination to find a pattern in the world that governs everything but his own errors, emotions and imperfections tell him something else that perhaps true madness is searching for these equations and patterns which don't exist and that the world is too complicated to be solved by Math alone.His struggle with his own paranoia is showcased in true gritty fashion and yes the film gets upsetting as usual. But it makes for a compelling story one which anyone can relate to but bear in mind it ain't for everyones taste. The bleak tone and depressing imagery doesn't make a jolly good time but an intellectually interesting one anyways.It is an interesting debut from a director who's gone on to show his talents further.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Pi: Faith in Aronofsky,"Sometimes a film is just so strange that you've only got an inkling of the filmmaker's intention and you have to trust that it's somehow woven together in genius fashion. That's where ""Pi"" lies, somewhere between the random and the perfectly calculated. Creator Darren Aronofsky appears to have run rampant in his feature debut, but one can easily argue that he's thought everything out meticulously. As a result, ""Pi,"" will satisfy the tastes of some and completely fool others.The main character is Max Cohen, a mathematical genius with some serious issues that lead to pill-popping. He believes in the power of math as a universal language -- nature's language and that there are patterns to everything. With the help of his supercomputer, he embarks on a task to determine a pattern governing the stock market, only what he's on to - - a 216-digit strand of the numerical value of Pi -- has a lot at stake for Wall Street and even a sect of Cabalistic Hasidic Jews who believe it holds Messianic clues.If a word could describe ""Pi"" in both plot and it's film-making, ""obsession"" would be the best choice. Aronofsky's shot sequences, with repetition and attaching the camera to his actors and the choppiness of the film suggest just how crazy this matter is to both Max and those transfixed on numbers. As Max immerses himself further in the mystery, things only get more chaotic. You get the sense that Aronofsky knew exactly what he was doing, but because it's so abstract and difficult to grasp, you're not totally sure if it all works. The fact that it's filmed in black and white might also suggest the same ""random pattern"" idea of the film. What seems to be so clear cut is really more maddening.""Pi"" might just be one of those ""second viewing required"" films. It's a cerebral thriller and relentless at that, clearly meant for the tastes of abstract movie watchers. Nevertheless, Aronofsky demonstrates some impressive skills, ones that no doubt led to his success in cult hit ""Requiem for a Dream"" years later.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Pi should score no higher than 3.14,"I'd heard about this movie after reading an article where a formula was discovered to let users calculate the nth digit of pi without having to calculate any of the previous digits.  As interested as I was to see this movie is about as dismayed as I am after having seen it.This movie contains all the right elements--pi, randomness, number theory, stock market chaos (the theory, not the traders) and the players that would likely be found in those fields.  But like your mother's cut-up spaghetti, none of the ends tie together in this movie.The movie is shot in grainy, high-contrast black and white.  Some may call it stylistic; I thought it was plainly harsh on the eyes.  There's a reason Hollywood has pursued different film types since the days of Buster Keaton. According to the commentary on the DVD I rented, the director stated that he wanted to ""let viewers see this movie from the perspective of Max's brain."" I think a better question is why anyone would _want_ to get in Max's paranoid, delusional, headache-prone brain.The film attempts to bond together the Kabbalah (Jewish numerical mysticism), the stock market fluctuations, pi (and its randomness) and Nature's cycles.  But like cheap glue it fails.  The subplot of Wall Street thugs bent on discovering a market forecaster is both unexplained and implausible.  The supercomputer Max has apparently built from discarded computer parts is barely possible, and strangely prone to a few stray ants. One funny moment comes when Max's former teacher, Saul, explains to him that the 216-digit number spit out by his computer before it crashed was a form of silicon consciousness.  Unfortunately, it wasn't meant to be funny.  The only plausible plot in this movie is that of the Kabbalah number theorists, but the movie spends more time explaining who they are than what their mission is about.In the end, the movie Pi leaves as many questions unanswered as there are digits of the number left to compute.  Unlike Conspiracy Theory and Enemy of the State, two paranoid movies which give credence to conspiracists, Pi offers no explanations for its unfathomable conjectures.  I was simply left to wonder why I wasted the last 85 minutes of my life.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"If this guy is doing Batman next, then great!","This was a strange choice for me but the video box made it sound really intresting.  The subject matter is handled very well and not in a manner that would be off putting to non maths people.  In fact it may send you away wanting to know more.  But the main bulk of the story is concerned with one man trying not to cave in to his madness and the outside world that wants a piece of him for their own ends.  Shot in black and white the print stock ranges from very fuzzy to crystal clear, but mainly medium, at all times reflecting the mood of our main character at that point.  Claustrophobic scenes of madness are highlighted by seemingly unnatural, almost blinding whites against empty blacks.  This is certainly a great way to start any study in to colour usage in film, or black and white more accurately.

The most intellectually satisfying film since Kubrick,"One thing I enjoyed about this film is that it takes the mystery and intensity of its plot and allows it to build slowly and purposely leaves holes for the audience's mind to play in. The black and white photography clearly delineates the black and white world of numbers and mathematics that both enslaves and fascinates the lead character, Max Cohen. But the film has the true mark of an artistic endeavor in that it does not attempt to be easily understood or understood at first viewing but allows several possible definitions.Aronofsky cleverly mimics his own storyline in his storyline, in other words the mystery of mathematical patterns within every aspect of life is mimicked in the patterned editing and layout of the film. It would be interesting to know if there was an intentional meaning to the editing patterns and repetitions in the film. I suspect that there is.However the best aspect of the film is the freedom it allows the audience to mull and think on the aspects that the film introduces. Does chaos exist or is it simply a maddeningly complex system of patterns? IS mathematic the only language? What the hell are numbers anyway, symbols for what? All in all an excellent film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Math and Melancholy Mix,"It's clear that the this film has a lot going for it in terms of originality and concept. The film tackles complex themes related to mathematics, obsession, and existential angst, which is a breath of fresh air compared to more conventional narratives. The low-budget approach is surprisingly effective; the filmmakers make the most of their limited resources with a raw, gritty aesthetic that adds to the film's atmosphere. The use of black-and-white photography enhances the film's mood and gives it a distinct, almost claustrophobic feel that works well for its themes.However, despite these strengths, the film left me feeling a bit disengaged. The narrative can be somewhat hard to follow, with its dense and abstract ideas making it challenging to stay connected with the story. The film's emotional coldness also creates a distance that makes it tough to invest in the characters' journeys. It's more intellectual than emotional, and while that can be compelling, it also risks feeling too detached.The pacing feels uneven at times, dragging in places and contributing to a sense of frustration rather than intrigue. The film's focus on its conceptual and thematic elements, while admirable, sometimes overshadows its ability to engage on a more visceral level. Overall, it's a film with a unique vision and a fascinating concept, but it might not be the easiest watch. If you're into exploring abstract ideas and don't mind a bit of emotional detachment, it could be worth a look. Otherwise, its complexity and coldness might leave you feeling more perplexed than inspired.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Highly introverted mathematician goes bonkers searching for patterns.,"Mathematics has come of age. There is now a bad mathematics movie to take it 's place among all the bad science movies. I was unable to suspend my disbelief so that I could sit back and  enjoy the movie. I was put off by the silly mathematics, the cheesy props, (Max's ""computer"" is a collection of 1970s era ICs placed randomly in a 19"" relay rack), the total lack of production values, (""Pi"" makes the majority of this year's independent productions look like ""Titanic""), and the silly plot.Ostensibly this is a movie about obsession. The protagonist is seeking to find a pattern in the digits of pi which will explain the secrets of the universe. This search has already caused his mentor to have a stroke because he was getting close to the answer and Max is departing farther and farther from the real world. Max's computer is able to predict stock market prices. He is pursued by a collection of bad guys including a brokerage house, and a group of Hasidic Jews who think the messianic age will begin when they pronounce the 216 letter, true name of God. Come on! Before this guy does another movie about oncoming insanity, he should sit through Roman Polanski's ""Repulsion"" at least three times in a row.Max's growing insanity is shown by increasingly bad camera angles as the film progresses. The lighting throughout looks as if it was done by Jim Varney playing Earnest. The print that I  saw looked as if someone had generated it in their home darkroom. There is no excuse for this lack of technique. Spike Lee, Wayne Wang, and Hal Hartley have shown that you can make a first film for peanuts and it can still look good.My advice is to go see something else.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

The numbers game.,"Religion and the search for God have been a thematic through-line for much of Darren Aronofsky's career and this, his debut, must have started this trend. I won't spoil exactly why, but the central theme of 'Pi (1998)' is certainly theological to some extent. This only becomes evident towards the final movement, which finally puts forward a potential answer to the movie's central question. What is the true nature of the elusive yet surely quantifiable figure that our increasingly erratic lead is desperate to find? In a way, it doesn't matter. The feature is far more focused on putting you in the headspace of its obsessed central character, using abrasive editing to convey his crippling cluster-headaches and a pulsating score to underline his ever-growing paranoia. It's in these aspects that the affair finds its most success. It's an effectively claustrophobic and off-kilter experience. The trouble is that it's also somewhat dull, with a lax pacing and a slow build-up to its inevitably somewhat disappointing finale. There just isn't all that much below the surface. Though it's enjoyably enigmatic, the picture simply isn't all that engaging. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brilliant exploration of the paranoia and madness of genius,"""Pi"" is a gritty, dark, and engaging film that locks you into the experience of a genius teetering on the knife-edge of madness. ""Pi"" is not for every moviegoer, but those who love the look and feel of film noir, and those who enjoy films that exercise the mind as well as the imagination, will not be disappointed.The story is based on a mathematician's pursuit of the number pattern that holds the key to the stock market. His theory holds that all nature operates under immutable laws. These laws may be expressed numerically. The stock market is a natural, numerical entity. Therefore, the stock market operates under mathematically expressed laws of nature. By finding the key sequence within the stock market, he will prove his theory that all nature may be expressed numerically.In his own words ""1. Mathematics is the language of nature. 2. Everything around us can be represented and understood through numbers. 3. If you graph these numbers, patterns emerge. Therefore: There are patterns everywhere in nature.""The tension of his pursuit is palpable. This is a portrait of the Mad Genius character that transcends the cliche, redefining madness and genius as portrayed on screen. As he gets closer to his goal, his paranoia increases, as do his headaches (convulsive attacks resulting from childhood trauma) and hallucinations.Adding to the madness are two groups interested in the hero's results. One group wants the key to the worldwide markets, while the other seeks the true name of God. Both need the hero's genius, but he needs them in fundamental ways as well: one for their technology, the other for their perspicacity.Shot in black and white, the filmmakers succeed in their attempts to create visual tension in a frequently static world. At times the camera bobs and weaves along with the motion and sanity of the hero, enhancing the film. It is neither disorienting, nor distracting--unlike the mind-numbing camera motion in ""The Blair Witch Project.""The music is best described as industrial-driven rhythm. The main titles feature a track by Massive Attack that musically expresses the anxiety, frustration, energy, and madness of the hero's pursuit. Just as the camera-motion sequences add to the film's impact, the music provides a perfect paranoiac aural soundtrack.Mathematical references abound in the film, all of which are explained in their most basic form without being condescending. Greek theorists and the Japanese game Go are made relevant to the story. And the hero names his computer Enigma, after the legendary Nazi code broken at Bletchley Park during World War II.The most glaring problem with the film was its predictable storyline. Within the context of the film the story is perfectly logical--what you would expect from a film based on a mathematician. It is, therefore, predictable. What mitigated this problem for me was my interest in the execution of the film. While I had a good idea what was going to happen, I was nevertheless happy to witness the events unfold. Credit the director with making the film engaging despite the problem with the script.This film succeeded where ""Kafka"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"" failed. It created tension, suspense, and drama without falling bring a one trick pony (Blair Witch) or falling into melodrama (Kafka).",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Pi Review.,"I didn't really want to review this film as there's not a great deal to say about it that people haven't already. Darren Aronofsky's debut film is a bizarre, surreal, intelligent, paranoia fuelled film about a mathematician who's trying to uncover the patterns of the universe.The main reason I wanted to talk about this film, is that Clint Mansell's incredible score is in my opinion one of the best scores I've heard in any film. It's an expertly constructed piece of work that helps to elevate every aspect of this film. The score is perfectly intertwined with the central character of the film, and works as his inner monologue to reflect his different mental states throughout the film. From being eerie to panic ridden to sheer mania it's a bold piece of work. That when I found myself drifting from the film it was the score that kept sucking me back in with it's intoxicating atmosphere.The film on the whole is pretty good, but without the score I don't think this film would've worked nearly as well as it did. I would recommend watching this film for the soundtrack alone.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
White Light/White Heat,"Until reading some of the reviews posted here, I must admit I had never thought of the ""Eraserhead"" comparison (you learn something new every day). The more I think about it now, the more the film seems like ""Eraserhead"" if Lynch had taken a rather large quantity of speed and a crash course in mathematics.Which is unfair.  In actuality, the film has little in common with ""Eraserhead""'s elegant cinematography and deliberate pace.  This movie is, above all, a portrait of obsession.  The ending is a bit too easy, but up until that point the film creates an utterly believable atmosphere of impending madness.  The grainy photography and hyperkinetic cutting are crucial.Other than that, not too much more to say about this one.  An ""art house"" film it may be, but it's one of the more interesting ones I've seen in the past several years.

Requiem for Pi,"I've watched both of Aronofsky's critically acclaimed films by now and I must say, I do not find them good. There are interesting elements, but the films are not interesting. Take Pi for example. The shaky cinematography, by the emphasis on the madness of Maximillian rather than on Maximillian himself, made it very difficult for me to ¬ëget into' the film or even figure out what was real and what was not. Despite that criticism I have to admit, that the mathematical parts of this film were interesting and somewhat ingenious.My criticism does not mean that either Pi or Requiem for a Dream are bad films, I just want to say that they're not all they are cracked up to be and that I therefore would not recommend them film to anybody. I'd rather see Donnie Darko, Bully or Irr√®versible again. I guess what I want to say is: Aronofsky is just not for me and I dare say that if you did not like Requiem for a Dream too much, you the same will probably go for Pi and the other way around.6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"pretentious and number-illiterate, but good-looking","The basic problem with this film is its content. If we were to retrocede back to the times of Lumi√®re when cinema consisted of the beauty of muted black and white photography in motion, and then watched Pi under that light, i.e. as a choreography of moving images, then this film wouldn't be bad at all. Actually, as I was watching it I realised how easy it was to turn what is essentially a bad film into a quite satisfactory cinematic experience: simply turn off the sound (if in the cinema, cover your ears). Whoever was in charge of the photography had a good sense of what he was doing. It even is related to silent cinema: the dream-sequences which show the mathematician doing a sort of brain surgery on his own brain are an obvious quote of or homage to Bu√±uel's Chien Andalou. So what is amiss with its content? First of all the actual mathematics behind the story are bogus. To anyone minimally cultured or with some interest in science will squirm in agony at such numeric gibberish; the sheer ignorance of whoever was responsible for the script is worrying. Am I to understand that nowadays American independent cinema is trying to sell its products to the same audience that has been bashed into dumbness and allergy to culture by Bruce Willis and his cronies? Instead of consulting with mathematicians, the people responsible to the film seem to have decided that ""they won't notice, so what's the difference"". But that is not the only problem with Pi. There is this annoying overacting that makes the film border on a parody of itself. ""It is death"" [referring to the number pi], cries the professor, with such exaggerated gestures and emphasis, that one can't help laughing at the whole ridiculous situation. And then there is all the psychosis and drug-addiction of the main character, which simply doesn't fit in with anything the film seems to be about, and gets on one's nerves. Finally there is the repetitiveness of the whole film. I think a well done trailer of the film would contain everything the long version does. But the best solution would be to edit it and delete the soundtrack, which would leave a short silent film that would resemble and be close to the level of Bu√±uel's masterpiece Un Chien Andalou.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Guerrilla filmmaking of mathematic nightmare,"There are many scenes that I can't get out of my head from this very smart debut of Darren Aronofsky's. Most notably is when Maximillian (played by co-writer Sean Gullette) rips open his brain. Why? Don't let me get into it, you will have to see it for yourself.I don't know how PI was thought up, but it's a dark, disturbing, and interesting creepy-crawly sort of brain stimulator. You don't have to be a math whiz to enjoy it (I am certainly not one) but at some moments it helps. This is almost a science fiction sort of thriller, in a socialistic way. You have to be a big thinker, like the main character, Max.Max is a genius, he constantly computes equations given to him by a neighbor kid in the building he shuts himself in at. He is also a mentally tortured genius, obsessed with a number he tries to calculate with his homegrown computer. He is also a weirdo, who shaves his head after too many violent headaches, which may be caused by his abnormal gift (which may had come from staring at the sun when he was a child). Odd premise, eh?But back to the number, which ultimately sets up the stage for the cyberkinetic noir/video-droned Hitchcockian thriller. The number is mythically the key to either the stock market or God. Either way, he is hunted down both by shady Wall Street henchmen and a gang of Rabbis (?) who desperately need him to compute the number for their great fortune. But Max believes he is the chosen one and searches for the numerical answer himself, even as it pulls him into an abysmal downward spiral of madness.This movie is as weird as it gets. But screw traditionalism. This is one of the most thoroughly creative and oddly developed pieces of work in modern film.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Custard,"What a mess. There may be some fashion in camerawork that I'm missing. But never mind as the point of the film seems to be in its story, and that is a great failure.Mathematics is not arithmetic, even the mathematics of numbers. Patterns are, well, patterns, not characterizable by a number, or any numbers for that matter. Kabbalah is not Gematria -- the latter is for schoolchildren and astrologers; virtual schoolchildren. Kabbalah is deeply group theoretic. None of this has much to do with computers. If there was a group interested in insights it would be the marmalade crowd at NSA. At least `Good Will' got THAT part right.Believe me, there is a very interesting film with ideas roughly proximate to this. That's why this is such a shame.",,Anonymous,Horror
"It's survival of the fittest, Max--and we've got the f%#@ing gun.","First off, Pi is very much a ""love-it-or-hate-it"" kind of film. I loved it. For me, it was less about the number theory, and more about a base human emotion-paranoia. And, in that sense, the movie was extremely effective. The starkness of the black and white picture, the dizzying camera angles, the techno soundtrack all put the viewer smack in the middle of Max's paranoid world. Overall, this was a worthy effort from a young, first-time film maker. To borrow a phrase from a friend of mine: This may not have been the best film of '98, but it was one of my favorites. Now to my second point: After reading the posts of others who've seen Pi, I was disturbed, and rather offended by some of the oh-so-smug statements condemning people who enjoyed this movie to the status of pretentious, shallow, art-house morons who lacked the intelligence to see the scientific and mathematic flaws. People like that are just as heavy-handed, self-righteous, and annoying as people who accuse others who didn't like this movie (or others like it) of being to stupid to ""get it"". *Attention* Pi is a work of fiction, NOT a documentary.

The nature of mathematics,"*Please, don't read this commentary if you have not seen the movie yet Since little, i never like the mathematics. The movies is, have been, and i hope than still be one of my passions. When i was little, i thought that the mathematics don't give much to world and don't be necessary. Few years ago, i reflect of their importance in spite of my little interest for it. Max Cohen says for encouragement his rules and beliefs. The first one was ""Mathematics are the language of nature"", the second one ""All can be explain or understood by numbers"" and the third and last one was ""Nature has systems that can be represented"" Max Cohen is the famous math of ""Pi"". Max was obsessed with the idea of found the mystery that revealed Pi. He has an hypothesis about the order and the secret that was hidden behind the numbers of the stock. His brain don't have any other obsession than that. He maybe is so close of found the secret... but there is people who is interested in that secret too. But his obsession make that his brain, that have all the answers and ideas, suffer.The topic of ""Pi"" sincerely rouses me. And I am still bad with the mathematics. This movie talks, in a frenetic way, about the obsessions of the human mind and how can take to the limits in a bad way. In spite that the the filmography of Darren Aronfsky is not much, ""Requiem for a dream"" (That have a lot of visual characteristics like ""Pi"") and this one makes him one of the best director of today.""Pi"" is a perfect analysis about the human mind.

It is intelligent, thought-provoking and it does not use one of the formulas Hollywood has been repeatedly using in the last decades. The soundtrack, mostly composed of electronic music, is incredibly good and works perfectly with what you are seeing on the screen. And what you see on the screen is even better than the soundtrack! The black and white photography is in harmony with the paranoid, schizophrenic, claustrophobic mood of the movie. Sean Gullette is great as Maximillian Cohen and the rest of the cast is very good.

"Boring, Overlong, and Pointless","The premise starts off interestingly and could be good if it were properly developed, but the story could have been told in 30 minutes maximum, probably less. The movie looks like a film student's attempt to create some MTV version of 1940s film noir.After 10 minutes, you keep waiting for the story to develop, but it never goes anywhere. All you see is endless repetition, both visually and musically, if you can even call the score music. I watched it to the end only because a good friend recommended it, but so little actually took place, that I found I could read the Sunday Times at the same time.While the film was made in 1998, the computer complex looks like something from the 1970s which just adds to the lack of any believability. There isn't a character you can take any interest in, other than Samia Shaoib who happens to be gorgeous, but she does no more than make a cameo appearance.I like creative films and look for ones that are outside of the Hollywood mainstream, but this sure doesn't qualify.

Fascinating psycho thriller made on a shoe string budget.,"'Pi' is a great example of the best things about low budget independent movie making. Ideas are more important than money, and good acting more interesting than special effects. It's a pity mainstream Hollywood ignores this time and time again. Aronofsky really gets value for his dollar here - the movies looks stunning. The script is original and involving, and the acting is first rate. The real find here is Sean Gullette in a very impressive debut. He also co-scripted this fascinating looks at mathematics, madness and mysticism. Highly recommended.",,Anonymous,Horror
Are there patterns everywhere?,"I think Aranofsky himself is a genius - he shot such a solid and mature debut film with such a low budget. ""Pi"" reminded me ""Stalker"" by Andrey Tarkovsky. Similar style with unexpected angles and beautiful BW shots (the tempo in 1979 was much slower), surreal and disturbing atmosphere and even direct parallels - milk poured in the coffee in ""Pi"" reminded me the famous ink-in-the-water shot in ""Stalker"". Both films invite you to think further. Would we ever be able to comprehend the laws determining our existence? Could all those patterns and formulas discovered by the scientists ever explain the logic of our lives? Or are they just building blocks, randomly tossed by the nature? A conclusion we could derive from ""Pi"" and other films about scientists and great thinkers is that rational intelligence would not make us happy. So, I've switched off my brain and enjoyed the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Paranoia Paranoia,"One of Aronofsky's earlier films 'Pi' is a complex treat to watch. The director makes the film using simple devices. The black and white colour and hazy image shot with digital camera successfully create a very tense, detached and cold atmosphere. 'Pi' is clever, complex, engaging and absorbing. Cohen's world of paranoia and obsession is that of a web of odd characters, Wall Street, computer science, the Torah, Kabalah and of course, numbers. The slick editing maintains a fluid energy on screen and the unforgettable soundtrack fits the soundtrack terrifically. 'Pi' can be seen as one of the prototypes of the superb blend of soundtrack and movie. The acting too is very convincing. Sean Gullette does a very good job of leading the movie. Yet, the real winners here are Aronofsky and Clint Mansell (who came up with the score). Once again the director has created a unique film experience of paranoia for the viewers.",,Anonymous,Horror

I liked and enjoyed advice of minutes with the mastery of Arlofski. OK... Director's job level, operators have also all notes by myself.

"Daring, Different, Brilliant, Flawed","Pi is a portrait of Obsession with a capital O. Max is obsessed with finding patterns in the numbers and the nature all around us. He braves the wrath of his landlord, the scorn of his mentor, alienation from his fellow man, the rebellion of his own body and mind, even the possibility of his own destruction in pursuit of The Answer. I found the portrait of this young recluse's obsession and drive to be the most compelling aspect of the movie.It does have flaws. As others have noted, Max's character is a little on the shallow side. That's not the actor's fault, it's the script's fault. The actor (Sean Gullette) shows promise, I think, but this movie seems to strain his range slightly. Mathematicians will whine that the math stuff is fantasy. Computer techies will whine that Max's computer, though undeniably cool-looking, is a junkyard fantasy. Other nitpicks fall in a similar vein.Despite the flaws, I bought a copy of this movie the first time I had the chance. I liked the totality of Max's obsession with The Answer that much.

highly-enjoyable trip which only reveals its structure on a rewatch,"I've seen this film 3 times now: the first time, as it first came out, was an absolute trip of an experience (I may have been somewhat under the influence myself). It was very enjoyable, but I understood next to nothing.Couple of years later I saw another Aronofsky: Requiem for a Dream. As the fella shares my first name (although relatively common, it's somehow rarely seen in the arts) I was all up for supporting his second film. Alas, it was trash, saved from a dustbin score only by how well-made it was technically, and mostly by Ellen Burstyn's stunning performance. 5/10 in the end.Disappointed, I returned to Pi to find out if the hash was to blame for my enjoying it. Turns out not, I still really liked it, and this time followed some more of the story, tho' still felt slightly bewildered.In the intervening 10 years or so I've seen The Fountain which was a boring pretentious fart of a movie, not redeemed by the interesting visuals (3/10). Now just recently decided on a third watch of Pi, and this time I understood the whole film: the concept, ideas, narrative...it's so clear now! Reminds me very much of my experiences reading (and re-reading) Zamyatin's We. Any work of art which reveals more of itself over time is worth something special.Throughout all 3 watches Pi remained an excellent 9/10 experience. Best not to tell you anything about the story or characters, just that the:acting is superb.direction is dynamic and exciting.high-contrast black/white is extremely effective.use of sound is excellent.concept is satisfyingly high-end.And it's got Hector from Breaking Bad in it :)If you enjoyed Requiem & Fountain, I really can't say if you'll like Pi.

When faith becomes knowledge,"The stark black and white transparency film used to shoot this Sundance Festival winner facilitates the viewer's transition into the dream-like world where imagination, faith, and the search for scientific knowledge, all meet.   Once we have been absorbed into this nether world that lurks on the edge of ""normal"" reality, we are offered a 1990's version of the Faust legend in which the price of ultimate knowledge is not loss of one's immortal soul to the Devil, but loss of sanity or even life.  The presenting question is whether and what mathematical patterns govern our seemingly random existence, and the film suggests that there is a pattern even in the search for such knowledge --  as characters representing basic science, corporate power, and traditional religion, all demonstrate similar frightening (and equally ambiguous) behaviors in their different  approaches to knowledge.There are a few flaws in the plot which demonstrate that we are witnessing the art of people who have more talent as young film makers than specific knowledge of either religion or science.  A research budget for the screenplay would have helped - but the movie was made  without money for such niceties.  The film's ability to raise serious questions about its subject matter even with these flaws is a testimony to its power.  We look forward to the future work of director, writer, Darren Aronofsky -- and writer, actor, Sean Gullette.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Interesting idea; not enough substance,"Aronofsky's debut shows the kind of potential he has as a director. Seeing what he did on a shoestring budget is a reminder of what Spielberg did with his debut in ""Duel"". Pi seems to have a very interesting plot as the film starts, however, sets off in the wrong direction thereafter.The story surrounds the discovery of a man named Max, a genius mathematician who spends what seems like all of his time on his computer looking for a pattern in numbers that none of his predecessors could find. Eventually Max comes upon these numbers in what seems to be a fluke situation and from here on in, he begins his downfall. Max is the victim of violent headaches as a result of staring at the son when he was six-years-old. The fact that this was thrown into the plot seems unnecessary and really has no effect on the film. I believe that Aronofsky should have just left these violent headaches to his unending desire to figure out the patterns.Up to this point, the film goes well until unnecessary third parties are thrown into the equation. The choice of stock brokers and ultra-orthodox jews aren't most people's idea of the bad guys in film (try substituting these groups for villains found in any action film and you'll see what I mean). One scene involving Max being dragged into the car by the Moses-like beards that comprised the religious group is funnier that most Saturday Night Live skits even though it isn't meant to be.Aronovsky chooses to use these new catalysts to drive Max crazy quicker. Sticking to his obsession with numbers would have been more effective and probably a lot more interesting since these groups are not at all menacing.The use of grainy black-and-white film was a nice touch here. It really helps to show that there is no cohesiveness in Max's life and how unimportant he would be if someone else got there hands on the number. The ending is also very satisfactory, tying up the film the best way possible. Sean Gullette's performance as Max is also very believable and quite gripping. Without Gullette, this film would be nothing as his emotions are what really keep it going.Can't wait to see what Aronofsky has in store.7/10 stars.",,Anonymous,Horror

"Excellent mind Bender, cerebral thriller.","Pi, for an inde film, ranks right up there with a Terry Gilliam mind bender (Time Bandits, 12 Monkeys, and Brazil.)  My first impression coming out of the theater was that the look of the home built super-computer was very ""Brazil""-like.  However, this movie had its own feel.  A nice thing of watching inde films is getting away from the Hollywood equations for specific genres.The soundtrack was a very good choice for the film.  The techno/trip-hop gives edginess to the film, and it compliments the theme of math and order of numbers.  I bought the soundtrack the next day.The cinematography was excellent.  I think if the movie was in color, it would have taken away from the plot.  I don't know if the high contrast was intentional, but it was a great effect.  I was also very impressed with the non-standard use of the steadicam in Max's walking scenes.  The editing was a little to jerky between scenes in some spots, but some would say that was to add to the effect.Overall I gave the movie a 9 out of 10.

I have a sort of explanation for those who don't understand, but I think it would be more fun to try and figure it out for yourself.Two small complaints, though.  1:  The film and lighting quality was such that in parts I didn't quite know what I was looking at.  Perhaps this was done on purpose, because most of the time it was pretty clear.  But I like to catch everything the first time around. And, 2:  I've seen that ending before.

An extraordinary film with more symbolism than you can shake a calculator at.,"This is easily one of the greatest movies ever written and filmed. The images on screen speak volumes of the talent that Aronofsky possesses.Maximillian Cohen is a brilliant man plagued with a terrible disability; he is a slave to numbers and patterns. Being that he is unfortunately skilled in such amazing mathematical ways, he naturally takes on a job in numerology, trying to find a pattern --a perfect number-- to predict the way the stock market will move.Two different organizations are after that number as well, as it promises great power and wealth for both in their own ways. When Max catches on to the pattern, which he and his friend Sol had determined to be a simple bug, all hell breaks loose in Max's life.The visuals and symbolism in this film are striking. One truly needs to watch it multiple times as it is an extraordinary film with more symbolism than you can shake a calculator at.

One the most innovative and brilliant films I have ever seen.,"Darren Aaronofsky's beautiful exploration of the human mind and its breakdown is brilliant in all aspects. His acting is perfect, his sound and score bring the images all the more closer to you, the visual style is superb and brilliant, and the story is facinating and original. Wow! I was intrigued and mesmerised by this film, Aaronofsky drew me in with stark grainy black and white images and kept me guessing with brilliant metaphores and exiting direction. As i was watching this film i was hoping that the ending wasn't going to be disappointing, and it wasn't, i loved it, i was satisfied. This film daring to use such raw techniques left me in a state of awe. A truely flawless film. Don't just rent it, buy it!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Perfection,"This is the most amazing movie that I have ever seen in my whole life. From its very start, to its end this movie will keep you watching. The story line is so rich, and so deep, to fully appreciate it you'll have to watch the movie several times. Parts that seem useless or pointless (""When I was young my mom told me not to stare into the sun, so once when I was 6, I did"") make complete sense when viewed with the rest of the movie. The movie also has rather deep religious implications, teaching order instead of chaos. This movie will have you thinking for long after you see it. At first you may not ""get it"", but once you look at the ""big picture"" it all becomes clear. The directing is great, and adds some tension in some parts. The music is fantastic, and gets your blood flowing. This is one of the best movies ever made, and I think everybody should take a look at it. I plan on buying the DVD version once I get a DVD player, so I can watch the movie over and over again.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

The grainy footage, the camera effects; lense flares, CG, and FF motion, and more, with a large dose of ambiant ~ techno music that absolutely ROCKS!

My mother told me not to stare into the sun,"My mother told me not to stare into the sun.It pretty much tells about life through the eyes of a schizophrenic/autistic person. There's a lot of good one liners in the narration. The numbers don't quite match up if you decide to try and figure it out, but a great film with a great idea. Attracts the smart/reclusive types...and their friends and their enemies. Good low budget effects which got the budget for Requim for a Dream which is almost as good. I watched this once and immediately rewound and watched it a second time and then watched the next day. This is a film that will forever be burned into my memory. Black and white medium doesn't always work, but this film could't work any other way. Highly Recommended. Check out Metropolis(1927)- silent film...good stuff.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"GREAT indie flick, buy it!","A very unique black and white art film. Actually it was pretty messed up (similar to Pink Floyd: The Wall and A Clockwork Orange), but the story was extremely well thought out and the editing was extraordinary. Plus, there was a song from my favorite techno group, Orbital (they have done other movie work as well, most notably for Event Horizon). The direction was spectacular, considering the apparent budget of the movie, and the acting was fairly perfect for the characters. Surprisingly neat visual effects as well. Even the score ruled for the movie (you can hear some of the original score on the web site). A rather interesting story about a mathematician who is on the verge of discovering the numerical equivalent for the name of God.

FINALLY! A REAL THRILLER!,"""Pi"" the dazzling and bleak debut feature from Darren Aronofsky, refers to that unending number that is often rounded out to 3.14 and is used in algebra classes around the world.But this isn't a math movie. I think the best way to look at this film is that it is about obsession. The main character is so obsessed with finding the real number, which is believed to be infinite, that the film is a study of obsession and madness.But I don't want to give away the plot and spoil Aronofsky's nice surprises. I do want to say that I think it's amazing that ""Pi"" is able to be such an effective thriller without resorting to the usual T&A and standard shoot-em-up chases. The grainy black and white photography only adds to the feel of a lonely guy's world.Some people complain that ""Pi"" contains no big stars. I think that big stars would have hurt the film. Honestly, can you imagine Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sly Stallone or Mel Gibson trying to find out what exactly is Pi? Unknowns only make this more believable.See ""Pi"" more than once. It may take some more than a few viewings to fully understand it. But at least Aronofsky has some good ideas and is content to make a muddled film rather than a neat, contrived one.

Even if unfamiliar with the philosophical underpinnings, there are a plethora of other reasons do like this movie. Namely, the soundtrack, the metaphors, the emotion, the screen shots, and probably the best ending I've ever seen.

Stumbles on it's newborn feet,"Watching Pi, I was instantly reminded of every earnest, horror/sci-fi film I'd seen in film school.  That's meant as a criticism, and I found myself wondering how Pi was received by a ""mass"" audience rather than as excellent student-film for Aranofsky's reel.Let's start with acting, since the most immediate part of any film about people is the people in the film.  The only character with dimension, intrigue, and screen charisma (not interpersonal charisma, but watch-a-bility) was the character performed by Ben Schenkman.  He was also one of the most minor characters.I was always aware of why somebody was cast or a character written in.  I feel, a lot of times, that a student film is trying to be longer than it deserves to be.  That there are moments where no narrative progression occurs, no exposition, just stuff to look at.Remember the scene on Coney Island when Max needlessly washes his face in the ocean water, it's in slow-motion.  Why?  I feel because the director or the cinematographer really wanted to do some slow-motion work, to see if it would work.  This shows a lack of pre-production on their part.I also recall the pointless love-interest character, the Indian neighbor, and how every motivation on her face seemed to be suggestive of imprecise direction, not a genuine character trait.Pi is not a film without its merit, but I fealt it was overhyped.  I can never hold a director accountable for the success of his film despite itself, and I honestly believe Aranofsky is a talented film maker, but Pi is not a great film.  It is an eloquent film at times, but mostly, it is a clumsy student exercise.",,Anonymous,Horror

A Frankenstein for the postmodern world...gritty and edgy plunge into paranoia and madness.,"Incredible.  Absolutely incredible.This is a movie full of paranoia, isolation, a slow decay into insanity, hidden meaning, subversion, mathematics, an incredible amount of drugs, mysticism, uncertainty, obsession, violence, loneliness, and an insatiable thirst for knowledge fueled by ego.  This is a Frankenstein for the postmodern world, where the computer holds all the promise for answers, but whose inner workings mystify most people who use them.  It's about patterns and structure in the midst of chaos.  It's about the human mind's constant craving for order, for intelligence's grinding quest to label and categorize and put semantic meaning onto bits and pieces of perceived reality.  It's about genius run awry and about those who would seek to exploit it and in so doing it help lead it to ruin.You have got to see a small independent film called Pi.  It's a mere 85 minutes of pure madness set to a ravingly edgy techno soundtrack. The editing is at times incoherent and incongruent, but exceptionally poignant.  It provides the viewer access to a visceral understanding amidst what might otherwise seem a boring premise: a mathematician's quest for some new theorem.  The tense editing techniques, invasive camera angles and stark contrasts in the lighting serve a crucial role as backdrop to this psychodrama as it unfolds.This is what great filmmaking is all about.  Certain comparison's to David Lynch's cult masterpiece ERASERHEAD are sure to abound, though this film is certainly easier to follow, less quirky and far grittier and accessible. It's easy for the viewer to get caught up in the narrative which includes visitations by Wall Street mobsters, a bizarre cult of kabbalistic Hasidic Jews, a nosy landlady with attitude and more.  Top Notch all around. Four stars.",,Anonymous,Horror

"We're Not Talking Table Talk Here,Gang","For years,numerologists have tried to crack the code of Pi,the highest number in the mathematical spectrum.

When he comes upon some soft ware that contains a formula for doing so,he is pursued by government goons & Hasidic Rabbi's who want a piece of his knowledge. Combined by all of that stress,coupled with his drug addiction (to prescription medications),the mathematician manages to obsess over numbers & their connection to all things in nature. This makes for a dark,surreal,disturbing journey of the soul. Filmed in a flat black & white,with camera work that may remind some of the experimental films of Stan Brakhage,and others.

Betters the Matrix in every way for modern science fiction,"This film caught me completely by surprise last year, i went to see it because my parents were going and i thought i might as well as i had nothing better to do. What i saw from the first moment up until the last was wonderful, Pi was the only film i had seen a the cinema twice. Complex and almost fit inducing (with all the flashing lights) Pi was actually quite easy to follow. This film is true science fiction - not just an elaborate fairy tale set in space or some war film (also set in space). This is sci fi for the brain, not sci fi for the popcorn and hot-dog fraternity. It may be full of number patterns and maths but you don't have to be a genius to consider it in such a way (my simple friend loved it and she isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer). Watch it, buy it, do whatever you can to see it - this film is magnificent, so all those that went on about the Matrix last year will finally be able to see what can be done with a small budget and big ideas (rather than a budget so big that the ideas aren't explored enough).

""Pi"" is one of the pitifully few media representations which manages to INTELLIGENTLY present the spiritual side of science and the empirical side of spirituality.While largely theory and/or fiction, ""Pi"" nonetheless makes a strong case for explaining the connection between a Creator and his methodology. We have determined the nature and physics of many things in the universe, and while we have yet far more to explain than that which we already know, we must realize that it is concievable that it could be possible to see how God runs things. Is there an upper limit to what we can know? Do we have the capability to become too close to God?

The film is about distraction, truth, religion, culture, greed; you name it, it's in there. It is visual representation at it's current high, both technically and creatively.

Aronofsky may be a ""one off"", his contribution to film with ""Pi"" is pretty unique. ""Pi"" may be a bit too arty at times with brains being stabbed with pens on subways etc. I think I got the metaphors but it was sheer brilliance without them. I think the point about the maths (and the story) that some people may have missed was that this underlying number as an answer to everything in the universe to explain ""chaos"" was not a possible clean and logical mathematical conclusion but more a divine and holy number that mortals should never be allowed to know. Max Cohen found himself for example predicting the wall St. Stock prices for no apparent mathematical reason. He had found something special in the 216 digit number that went beyond calculus and into the spiritual realms of ""Lenny Meyer's"" true name for God and another power this number held. A brilliant piece of writing where everything was referenced to the point of being believable. It's also the first time I've liked Drum+bass music, pretty cool sound track.

Besides, even if it WAS based on a true story, Russel Crowe will never get my vote for acting. His method acting style really, really gives me the creeps. Well, then, where might my curiosity of the mathematics and sciences lead me? What's interesting about arduous code-breaking anyway? It must be Arronofsky's fault that I'm asking so many questions. I have a theory that if you receive an answer, it's kind of like potato chips, you can't stop grabbing for more. Speaking of chips, I'm still confused about his first movie. Either the ming mecca chip was responsible for the atrocities of man, or Max Cohen. Reminding me of the age-old question, what came first; the chicken or the egg?Questions may seem arbitrary if you don't truly receive any tangible answers. But that doesn't stop physicists from quantifying electrons! And it definitely shouldn't stop your enjoyment of ""Pi"". From beginning to end. But the scratchy camera-work and ear-popping soundtrack may scare off the newbies, teenyboppers, and elderly. Well, I personally won't be missing them that much. I like my art the way I like sex, hard to get most of the time, and usually fulfilling for only half of us.If rumors are true, this may be your one chance in cinema history to watch a real live brain be penetrated by a pencil tip. But, goodness gracious, that's not saying much after you see the finale! I have to say, there's been a lot more surprising endings to movies that I've seen, but I'm hard-pressed to think of one more appropriate.""Eureka, I have found it!""In all seriousness, ""The Blair Witch Project"" really did what no other film had done. Made millions with thousands. ""Pi"" was, too, on a shoestring budget. The similarities don't stop there. As mentioned before, the camera-work is really nerve-wracking. It's scary, and there are very few namebrand actors in the film. By the way, Marcy Dawson, the stock market recruiter, would be my own personal definition of witch. Not to be misleading, however, while the former had us lost deep in the woods¬Ö This movie is just DEEP.Based on a concept that many major thinkers have always suspected and strived to decipher, ""Pi"" is not afraid to break boundaries of any type. The idea is repeated many, many times through the film, in the exact same consecutive phrases leading to the conclusion that there is a certain code in nature that if broken would lead to enlightenment. Well, alright, I take back what I said earlier about redundancy in code-breaking. Kind of. You see, Max Cohen is trying to find the big one. But he's not the only one. Count the badguys in this film and you'll be left wondering why he even bothers. You'd think that the answer to life itself would be more readily shared with the public in today's age of mass communication. On the contrary, we find that greed does indeed outdo a do-gooder.Hidden deeper, though, the truth that Max Cohen may actually be the wrong guy to try is inevitable. After all, we had dudes in the past who claimed enlightenment. One was hung to death, one disappeared in a forest, and one, well, reportedly ""prayer-dueled"" himself to death. Look at the number of digits he seems to be so attached to. 216 = 6x6x_ . I'll let you fill in the blank. Use a calculator if you have to, I won't consider it cheating.Despite the scratchiness, the camera lens never seems to do anything unnecessary. In fact, this may be the beginning of a new age of film-making and we never even knew it. Matthew Libatique and Darren Arronofsky (who also wrote the of course ingenious script) are claimed to have invented the technique of the ""hip hop montage"" in cinema. In which the score (brilliantly executed by Clint Mansell) guides the viewer through a series of moving frames. The acting is superb on every count. Even the little girl next door seems to take on some sort of magic, emphasized by her last question to Max as he descends down the stairwell of the project building they share together. 748 divided by 238. Well, it's close, at least.Hands down one of the most thought-provoking films of all time, ""Pi"" deserved every Oscar nomination that ""A Beautiful Mind"" gained later. But it's okay, Russel Crowe may have stolen the University, but Sean Guillette still holds the Universe.Something's going on. It has to do with that number. There's an answer in that number.""Pi"" (1998) 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
people are missing the point,"In reading comments about this movie, so many people i think miss the point of it.  I have read so many reviews criticising the math of the movie, though i wish people would realize that the math is wrong on purpose. Certainly there are errors in it, but those only reflect the main character's further journey's into insanity.  Having seen both of Aronofsky's films, I believe that this is the central focus of his work. Man goes insane, but how? in Pi, it's the numbers, pounding a life long mathematical genius forward.  As a person afflicted with Cohen's intelligence, i understand what was going on in the movie.  of course the math made no sense, because as he continued to inquire, he tried to make sense of things that didn't.  and please, don't complain about the end of the film.  the drilling was a suicide, and it is only in his death that the genius himself can finally understand his true wish, the wish to be able to say ""i don't know"".",,Anonymous,Horror

An interesting and thought-provoking dichotomy of genius and mania.,"I found Pi to be excellent.  Some may criticize the science behind the premise of the movie, as well as its execution.  Although the pace and timbre of the movie is frenetic, and at times disjointed, one might argue that this most closely mirrors the mood of the main character and is therefore intentional (and not just careless editing/cinematography, and so on).The most salient concepts of the movie are based in scientific fact. There does indeed exist a subset of numbers that manifests itself in the design of living organisms throughout the phylogenetic map.  From the nautilus shell to the honeycombs in beehives; from probability functions of electron orbitals to the structure and function of nucleic acids, a pattern of physical parameters converge and share a common thread- mainly that such designs might be explained in terms of their common mathematical attributes.Maximillian Cohen is an obviously gifted man- an brilliant but eccentric mathematical genius whose intellect is rivaled only by the pervasiveness of his 'demons' (mainly his obsessive, unabashed desire to find a unifying theory grounded in the pure logic of numbers).  At the same time, he is plagued by serious physical and emotional symptoms.  This theme is neither novel nor purely fictional; many examples come to mind with even a cursory review of history (Van Gogh, Dostoyevsky, Newton, Galois, and the like). All these individuals were considered great intellects while at the same time were beleaguered by clusters of physical and psychological problems, hence the schism of intellect and affect.Some criticize the film for its portrayal of Max's physiological symptoms, but from a medical perspective, not only are these symptoms accurate (delusions and hallucinations indicative of temporal lobe epilepsy, also migraines and epistaxis indicative of excessive cerebral vasodilation), but they also serve to explain the reasons for the director's choice of striking (and, at times, disturbing) visual effects.  This mitigates the choice of camera angles and shots and serves as a window to Max's consciousness.Mathematicians might not be satisfied with the paucity of details relevant to the mechanics of the thesis (calculus, chaos mathematics, analytical geometry, and set theory), and non-mathematicians unfamiliar with the concepts behind the thesis might argue that the intent is to glamorize the subject by taking liberties with the science of mathematics.  However, in my own opinion, the film strikes a balance that allows both groups to catch a glimpse of the man behind the math, as well as the depth of his afflictions.While dark and brooding, the cinematography perfectly complements Max's descent into madness.  With deeper understanding of a unifying theory of nature comes the heightened realization that such information is in great demand, and those wishing to possess this information are obviously willing to do whatever it takes to get it.  The result is a dizzying, and at times, terrifying glimpse into the world of chaos.I think that the film is astounding.  Rarely have I seen such an intriguing, intelligent attempt at making the science of mathematics interesting.  You may love it, like I did, or you may hate it.  But there's one conclusion that nearly everyone will share: it will make you THINK.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Hagiography,"As debuts go, Darren Aronofsky's has to be one of the best ever.The imagery is simply astounding, unlike anything I have seen before, and the beautiful uniformity of the black and white visuals dovetail superbly with the unadulterated chaos of the soundtrack, pounding away constantly in your ears, and enabling the viewer to feel an affinity with Max's sufferingAs for Sean Gullete, faultless. He could so easily have ended up in a mere supporting role for a swirling cup of coffee or seashell, yet instead links all the disparate elements together, to truly make Pi the story of one man.

Simply incredible!,"I hadn't ever heard of this movie when I rented it, but I'm darn glad I did! Darren Aronofsky is as talented as any filmmaker out there today. Do yourself a favor and see this one as soon as possible. The use of the camera is of special import in this movie, and is reminiscent of a cross between Sam Raimis' earlier work and the works of Roman Polanski. Aronofsky has a distinct visual style and a love for weird montage pieces. However, as great as this movie is, if you do not like experimental films that tend to challenge the viewer to make sense of it, rather than a neatly laid out and well explained plot, you more than likely will not enjoy it. On a $60,000 budget, Darren has made a lasting impression on the film world that will not soon be forgotten.P.S. This movie has some of the greatest voice-over monologues ever!

God bows to math.,"There really isn't a lot I can say about this film that hasn't been said before.  Sure, it's not perfect, but what is?  Sure, it's aimed at lunatics and math geeks, but what's wrong with that?  Just because it isn't dedicated towards the 'Varsity Blues' crowd doesn't mean it's automatically a bad film....Pi is one of those movies that does something that any good book makes it's reader do -- THINK.  It makes you wonder about society, feeling sorry for the real people out there who are stuck being that smart.  Sure, not every genius has strange flashbacks and is addicted to solving math problems, but some [probably] do.  It also makes you realize that some people take their obsessions (math, religion, et cetera) WAY too far.I think everyone should rent it.  I'm not saying that everyone will enjoy it, but I still feel that even throwing it in for five minutes will make a person think about it.  (Even if they're only thinking 'God this sucks...' at least they're thinking.)

Hit or miss,"To be honest I really can't give this movie a negative or positive review; I was kind of neutral about it. Maybe because the positives and negatives of the film both canceled eachother out.At best it was very well produced for such a small budget. The camera work was excellent, the acting was decent, and the storyline was fascinating. The storyline is also the negative.Somewhat confusing. I'm clear to the part where Cohen has a rare and painful illness where he has to take medication on a regular basis. And the fact he connects this illness to the key of the Universe, Key of DNA, Key of God, Key of the Stock Market. As complex as it sounds there is no thorough explanation to this, just graphics. I thought it was also kind of ridiculous that these stock market agents were always on his back about advice, so consistently that it leads to a violent confrontation.Make whatever you want to make out of it; it's really hit or miss.",,Anonymous,Horror

perfect paranoia,"I was really taken with this film. Everything about it appealed to me, the intriguing plot, the camera work, the high-contrast black and white, and the music (wow, the music). The most everyday situations were somehow full of menace, and ordinary people seemed malevolent. This movie makes you experience the paranoia of the main character from the inside. The music was incredible, featuring some great electronic bands. There were songs I recognized, but they were blended perfectly into the score, so that the whole movie had a constant flow, rising and falling in intensity with the action (and sometimes stopping so abruptly it makes you jump). Some of the other comments here criticize the movie on the basis that the ""science"" behind the theme (psychology and mathematics) is flawed, but if it were based in fact, explaining real, known theorems, it would lose its mystery. The great thing about movies is that they allow us to escape from mundane reality. Until someone makes a documentary this cool, I'll take the flawed logic any day.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pure Underground,"PI is an engaging film.  It has the visual quality of a very old pair of socks, washed with so many colored clothes, that it appears as though the characters have gray blood, and even that has drained away.  In a sense, their blood has drained away, replaced with an almost foolish obsession with trying to understand the universe.  We have all had such an experience; we believe that we have grasped some true insight into some idea, and then when we attempt to recapture that insight or articulate it - or, God forbid, develop it - we go bonkers.  This movie is alot of fun, with a great soundtrack to boot.",,Anonymous,Horror

the hard stuff,"yes I gave this a 10 out of 10, it's that good. I write this because I am annoyed with people complaining that this film tries to hard to be arty, intellectual and deep. And that comment from this guy about people telling him this is their favorite movie are pompous wannabe-intellictuals is just ridiculous. Has it ever occurred to you, little man.. .that those people might actually be intellectuals, or at the very least looking for intellectually challenging film? I know what ticks you off.. is all the pseudo-intellectuals acting like they like this, just because that's what all their hippie poetryslam friends do. That's a problem with those people... not this movie. Good enough with negativity.. why is this film so good? What makes this film good is that it's very, very low budget yet makes no compromise at all. From the onset it's clear that this movie is heavy and clearly not intended for those looking for light entertainment. It sticks to it's roots, it doesn't try to lure in big crowds by using some subculture hype or whatever. Once again... if you are into easier films.. great (me too), but don't look for this one.I'm not gonna spoil the story, because this film is way better if you don't know where it's going. But i'll tell you what I liked most about it. The soundtrack is an integral part of the story, it functions as a representation of the brainwaves of the main character or something like it, that's just genius. Also the film brings a real sense of paranoia with minimal means (making you even more paranoid) and no matter what your view on the relation between mathematics, strange theories, religion is, it will change the way you think about it.if you like challenging movies, can stand heavy endings, have the capacity to grasp all the subjects it implicitly touches upon, you can not go wrong. The film itself is pretty minimal and not everything is explained to the viewer and at the end of the story it lets you make your own conclusions.

This is my current favorite,I am conservative Christian who is also a physics major and this is my favorite film of all time currently due to the fact that it is part of the reason I have the faith that I do and explains why I have said faith.

I recently wrote a paper on this film for my Intro to Film class explaining all of the subtle nuances that Aronofsky uses to present the idea that perhaps there is more to the world that we see everyday.

"""When I was a little kid, my mother told me not to stare into the sun, so when I was six I did.""","Darren Aronofsky took on the endeavor of his first feature film, _Pi_, at age 28, with his only funding coming from $100 bills given by friends and family; the budget, in total, was $60,000. Why is this relevant? Because it is this ability to create something so magnificent out of something so modest that marks a truly great piece of art; this ability to find support in the foundation of an idea, rather than from the celebrities and production associated with a big budget release, that heralds a truly genuine film. Pi hits all the right notes.From the very beginning, as the overexposed black and white image thrusts us into a surreal, nightmarish world, and Clint Mansell's dark, electronic soundtrack starts to activate our adrenaline, it becomes obvious that we are in for a unique experience. It also becomes obvious that this is not a film for everyone. The low-budget cinematography constructs a tangible sort of insanity‚Äîwe are right there, alongside tragic protagonist Max, trying to navigate through the hullabaloo of a foreign-seeming world, and this can become tiring. But if an audience is willing to commit itself to a film that may, at times, be uncomfortable and confusing, it bears lofty rewards in the end.The premise itself isn't very complex: math mastermind, Max Cohen, attempts to uncover the nature of ultimate reality through number patterns. This is a subject that has been discussed time and time again by philosophers, and the film presents few (if any) ideas to add to the discourse‚Äîbut then again, it's not trying to. What it does do admirably is translate this abstract subject into a resonating visual landscape; it associates a concrete feeling to a vague concept.This is, in a lot of ways, similar to what _Eraserhead_ achieved a little over two decades earlier. Aronofsky admits to having been influenced by David Lynch, and this debut film is his clearest homage to vintage Lynchian style: from the nihilistic undertones to the industrial surroundings to the grotesque, surrealist images‚Äînumerous parallels can be drawn. But while _Eraserhead_'s protagonist passively trudges through the rubble, _Pi_'s leading man desperately tries to explain it, and it is with this desperation that the film builds intensity in a way _Eraserhead_ never quite does, nor attempts.However, despite its many successes, the film does suffer from a few downfalls worth mentioning, most of these a result of the low production cost. For one thing, the acting in many scenes, while not cringeworthy, can definitely become a distraction; this is partly due to the dialogue which doesn't lend itself well to the actors' interaction. Furthermore, there are instances when the camera becomes so shaky that it might take considerable effort to fully grasp what's happened (those instances are rare). But these are minor shortcomings that are easily overshadowed by the film's strengths.Overall, _Pi_ is a very fitting film to mark the beginning of an exceptional directorial career.",,Anonymous,Horror
It's about Enlightenment.,"Mathematics is the language through which the Max is trying to understand the ""logic"" of the universe (in his case, the stock market is his microcosm). He is looking for Spinoza's (and Einstein's) ""God""; the Natural Order of All Things.The mathematics are also a major sense of Max's own identity. He's like a trained monkey, performing math tricks for the girl next door. Proving with each proof, that he knows who he is.Max's struggle is analagous to the Jewish spiritualists, though he doesn't initially recognize that himself. Next to these pursuits, petty power games like those of the military industrial complex are derided. But they did serve a purpose...Max's Professor had stroke. He blamed it on a certain mathematical pursuit.He recognizes that his student is on the same path and warns him off--his life may hang in the balance.But Max persists and his computer, like his professor's, at the penultimate moment--just *as* it's concluding the answer--has it's technological own version of a stroke and explodes.So they talk and conclude that their machines (and the Professor himself, nearly) reached total consciousness. Where it... Understood. And in doing so, ceased to exist.Max's life deteriorates as he surrenders all to his pursuit. He (literally at times) opens his mind up and *realizes* the Is; the Tao; he sees through the illusion of interpretation (as math is an interpretation of nature).He realizes that his identity is merely an idea of himself, and in recognizing it, that part of him ceases to exist just as the computer--who could, like his ego, only deal with symbols and not reality--did.Having reached this point of Enlightenment, Max no longer has a need to deal in symbols. When the young girl asks him to multiply huge numbers, he sees no point in that egoic performance.

The number of madness,"After starting out with a couple of short films, Darren Aronofsky decided to take his first step into the world of cinema with his debut feature film. Made independently and with a moderate budget, Pi is a visual experience that offers an intriguing journey through the mind of a mathematician trying to decipher the stock market crisis. Inspired by the style of David Lynch and The Twilight Zone, Pi is a film with an easy-to-summarize story, but that simple plot manages to be captivating because of the way it is told. Everything happens through Max's perspective and his obsession with finding the patterns in Pi in the hope that it will give him the answers he is looking for. That obsession mixed with his migraines makes Max immerse himself in a kind of delusional and hallucination-filled trip that leads him to madness. As the film progresses, it becomes clear that Max's gift for mathematics becomes a kind of curse that destroys his mind.The main element of the film is that it mentions mathematics as part of a system that constructs our entire reality. Mathematics is often present everywhere, including geography. The idea is that through mathematics we can calculate everything that happens around us, but the film also raises the question that not everything can be summed up in simple mathematics because of the complexity of things. Max's obsession with finding patterns in Pi makes it clear that there is so much to dig into that it can lead to a deep abyss that disturbs the mind. That is what Max does and that is why he descends into madness. His ingenuity even becomes a target of Wall Street businessmen who seem to expect Max to provide them with a solution to the market crisis. His desire to decipher the patterns of Pi also attracts the attention of a Jewish group because it seems that Max's research will contribute to unearthing a secret that they are looking for. What the businessmen or the Jews want from Max is never resolved in the end, but as far as we know, Max spends much of the film being consumed by his obsession until it destroys his mind. The film even gives the impression that Max has unleashed something supernatural because of the connection it may have with the Jewish group's research.Furthermore, the film not only uses mathematics, but combines it with philosophy and it is a good pair because both currents were founded by figures from ancient Greece. The film takes this into account and that is why it is not necessary to be an expert in advanced mathematics to understand the concept. It is enough to understand what these two currents are. The relationship between the two is that they were used to try to unravel the secrets of the universe and what Max does is quite similar. His descent into madness has to do with the risks involved in trying to unravel certain knowledge. Maybe what Max has discovered is something dark after the market crash or something divine that the Jewish group was trying to unearth. That is something that is not known for sure, but the film makes a clear idea about how our quest for ultimate knowledge can lead us to our downfall. In all those aspects, the film is an ingenious psychological thriller that only the intelligent or average-intellectual people can appreciate.The visual aspect makes the experience much more striking. The editing and atmosphere offer a surreal psychological journey through Max's disturbed mind. The soundtrack is also something to be credited for. Darren intended this to be a sci-fi oriented genre film, but it qualifies more as a psychological thriller that is well done. Pi is undeniably a good film and a good start for the director in the film industry, but obviously this film is only for the intellectual people. Anyone from the average audience will not be able to understand what this film offers. My final rating for this film is a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Don't trust anybody who doesn't like this film.,"By this point, you've already read two dozen comments and know damn well what the story is about.  First of all, nobody should complain about the low-budget look of the film. i find nothing at all wrong with the look, and i can't believe how low budget it is (i've heard two figures, $20,000 or $60,000).  aranofsky even chose black and white for stylistic purposes, since color is actually cheaper nowadays. the style is sharp and intense, sean gillette's performance is perfect, the pace is fast.  while i thought the ending was a bit abrupt and could have been fleshed out a little more (such is the way of indie movies, they always love sudden endings, i cannot deny the overall power and uniqueness of this film.  i also question all the damn references to eraserhead.  the only thing in it that resembles eraserhead is when max pokes the brain with the pencil, and the resemblance is weak at best.  if you care about innovative cinema and want to watch something different and intellectual that is also exciting and stimulating, check this out.",,Anonymous,Horror
A surprise and a treat.,"For me, this movie was one of those happy discoveries. I was sifting through the usual Hollywood fluff at my usual rental haunt and came across this little gem amongst the Tomb Raiders and the Missions to Mars. Watching this film was a bit of a shock to the system as I am not accustomed to seeing films with such daring and intelligent writing and conceptualizations. This is a movie that really gives your mind's teeth something to sink into. Not to say that it's purely a cerebral experience, the imagery and the direction are also powerfully visceral. The sense of personal torment in our protagonist's everyday life is quite effectively communicated through the gritty black and white presentation and some rather disturbing imagery. If you're in the mood to shake the typical Hollywood movie flick doldrums you owe it to yourself to check this film out.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not pink, just gray.","If you like ""pink clouds and sugar-cane topped mountain"" movies, where a boy loves a girl and biggest disaster is that they don't see each other for two days, than this movie (the Pi) is not for you.

I don't recommend it for people who have never seen a non-color film before, but if you like alternative movies and do believe, that it's not a question of budget, celebs and big-time-studios to make a picture work, than you will love this. Be warned in advance, that this movie does not show a world of good and bad, where there is a good team (hero) and a bad team (evil, enemy); but a world of mixture, like the real world.

Life of Pi,"Daniel Aronofsky's brilliantly deranged thriller, 'Pi', is the story of a mathematician losing his mind. With its black-and-white photography, jerky editing, and 1970s aesthetic, the film creates a mood of tension, paranoia and plain confusion reminiscent of that found in the books of James Keleman or in Christopher Nolan's backwards-told 'Momento'; while the plot, though deliberately incoherent, takes the form of a Jewish version of the 'Da Vinci code', or 'Foccault's Pendulum'. Sean Gullette is excellent in the main role, and for affectionados of the game Go (often used in movies as a visual metaphor for genius), there's an added bonus of several Go-playing scenes. Disturbing, pseudo-intellectual fun at its best.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pi's originality creates a new sub-genre.,"When I saw Pi for the first time, I had not yet heard about it, and so was struck by its pure hard-hitting originality. This movie is unique in technique, style and content. The protagonist, a neurotic, eccentric mathematician on a quest to find a mathematical pattern in the stock market, is handled with brilliant unpredictability. The brilliance and madness in his mind is communicated visually through sometimes disturbing metaphors (like the throbbing brain on the side-walk). The grainy black & white and the unusual camera angles evoke unusual emotions in the audience and are in keeping with allowing the viewer to see the world as the mathematician sees it: where everything, even  trees, people and God himself works through mathematical patterns. One of the few faults of the film, I found, was the introduction of the stock-market fanatics which was not well developed. Excluding this could have left room for a more detailed development of the religious cult sub-plot. The strengths of the film, however, lie not in plot build-up or dialogue but undoubtedly in its unique style and content (achieved on a very limited budget). This makes it definitely worth seeing. In my book - a must-see.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

One amazing work of art,"There is so much I can reveal but i shall limit myself to three important points I would like to share with the curious movie lover's mind.Looking at it through an analyzing eye, I have to point out the importance of contrasts in this work of art. Not only they define the function of the absence of color but they also emphasize the techniques of this medium. In one sequence , the mixture of sound that pierces the actor's ears and yours is brusquely interrupted by complete silence which is intended. The spectator consequently enters the actor's state of mind. This metamorphosis is due to the fact that we , like the actor, live an exhausting trauma.I can also add that the silence is there to indicate the end of the actor's crisis.The second point would have to be surrealism. This art form, which is seen in many movies and paintings (Dali), is revealed through the presence of what seems to be a human brain .We realize only when the actor touches it that it belongs to him. We then understand the sufferance inflicted on his brain is caused by his need to know more, to eliminate his seizures.The last and third point is the message which is slowly and intelligibly conveyed. Nourished by mathematical , religious and philosophical words and images, we enter our world and its problems and redefine its essence.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Film made as Artwork and Silly Message,"As an artist, I appreciate all kinds of art. However, when people create movies with the idea that it's some massive artwork, I don't usually like it. I don't watch movies for artwork. If I was looking for artwork, I'd go to a museum, look up beautiful artwork on the internet, or draw/paint myself. Movies cannot be made into art. Movies are pictures in motion and sound, we usually use it as a medium to tell a story.They director filmed it in black and white. Even though the movie looks like it takes place between 1980-1990 (while it's filmed in 1998). Why does the director do this? To make sure we can't follow everything and strain out eyes, there is no other reason. Sure photographers make black and white pictures, but only because making something black and white can have several meanings, but this doesn't happen with movies.There is also a message in this movie. A message I draw is ""Ignorance is Bliss"" and ""Don't be obsessed with something, you might find it everywhere."" I like the second message, but I don't like the first. The other thing is, the guy in the movie goes insane, but he was already insane from the beginning. His obsession didn't cause that.The movie felt like a giant waste of time.

Sensation Debut Film By Darren Aronofsky,"Darren Aronofsky's feature film debut presents the now reputed auteur experimenting with various aspects of filmmaking to carve out his own distinct identity & contains all the elements that are now well associated with his works, be it the theme of obsession, biblical motifs, inventive use of camera angles, heavy use of montages, isolated characters or surreal structure.Pi (œÄ) tells the story of Max; a brilliant mathematician, who believes there are patterns everywhere in universe & tries to find the same in stock markets to determine its rise n fall on the basis of his calculations. But his increasing obsession with numbers ultimately results in his self-destruction when he's driven to the brink of madness by the people who are after his research.Written & directed by Darren Aronofsky, the film gives us a glimpse of his precision eye for art & aesthetics, is cleverly narrated from start to finish, and marks a sensational start to his directional career. Finely captured in greyscale photography, the camera-work exhibits a number of innovative tricks which he went on to use extensively in his later works & also provides a haunting atmosphere to the whole picture.But it's not just Aronofsky who makes his debut in the film industry with this feature for it also launched the film scoring career of Clint Mansell who provides an uncanny score to go with its equally bizarre plot. Sean Gullette delivers an excellent performance in the role of Max & carries the film amazingly well throughout its 84 minutes of runtime and he's nicely supported by the rest of the cast.On an overall scale, Pi is a smartly crafted psychological thriller that blends the mathematical patterns with religious beliefs in a very enthralling manner & offers a cinematic experience that's surreal in every sense of the word. Introducing Aronofsky's fresh psyche bursting with new ideas, Pi is an instant classic that remains one of the finest debuts for any filmmaker in recent memory.

Masterfully handled story of mathematical brilliance.,"Masterfully handled intense story of mathematical brilliance and the fine line between genius and insanity.

There is so much brilliant light and shade, perplexing angles to Pi, there is certainly little black or white and definitely no straight line journey. But persistence certainly has its rewards, and has left this viewer with a cleansed vision of what reality is to the individual, and the importance of maintaining your scruples! Though I nearly threw in the proverbial towel a couple of times, I am delighted to have stayed for the duration.

No budget masterpiece!,"Shot on a microscopic budget, this debut feature from Darren Arnofsky is an audacious, and superbly conceived sci-fi thriller. As is fairly obvious within it's history this is a genre that is particularly difficult to get right, with far more failures than successes. PI is a film that is intelligent, engaging, and shot for virtually nothing, while big bucks are often spent on poorly written drivel.Arnofsky's little masterpiece is filmed in black and white and the film is beautifully shot. The camera movements and the editing are very effective and really this film looks and feels fairly unique. Indeed the storyline itself is truly original and in this age of sequels, adaptations and remakes it's oft the case that we must trawl back through cinema of years gone by to find unique films we have yet to see. PI is delightfully such a case. Revolving around a loner, paranoid, maths genius called Max (Sean Gullette), the film portrays a character unlike what we have seen, yet believable. Inflicted with paranoia and hypochondria, Max lives in near total isolation, popping pills, avoiding the outside world where possible and constantly studying numbers, looking for patterns. As he begins to unravel certain numerical patterns, he finds himself the centre of previously non existent, attention. Max is psychologically unbalanced and the film follows him beyond breakdown, while he also tires to fend off his sudden popularity.Certainly this is a film that will provoke discussion and multiple theories, as the best of this genre should do. Still aside from an excellent script this features a pulsating score and soundtrack and also some excellent performances, particularly Gullette whose portrayal of Max is raw and at times brilliant. This is a film I took far too long to get round to seeing but I'm glad I did. ****",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Really good movie!,"A very good movie about a mathematician trying to elaborate a unifying theory to explain the universe using math as a language.

His struggle to overcome his boundaries results a growing paranoia, that is enhanced by a ""condition"" he acquired as a child. Don't understand why is this movie in black and white, but my guess is that it is because of this ""condition"". Would like to notice this movie is a perfect example of how good a movie can be even with very limited budget. Very good acting, music, scene and argument. The philosophical quest portrait-ed here is always up-to-date, and this movie is a good example of the ""common issues"" of those who seek unifying theories.1-Note: Mark Margolis is very similar to Paul Erdos.

Stuff David Lynch could have made,"The main reason I went seeing Pi was the soundtrack... When I left the theater,the only thing that wasn't on my mind anymore was whatever music that was in it.I was so stunned by the movie that I couldn't bring out any words for the first 10 minutes I left my seat: never did I see such a disturbing movie,with such a huge impact. Aronofsky's visual style reminded me immediately of Eraserhead combined with the nowadays popular music-video style,which ended up pretty nice. But what struck me most,was the emotional impact the movie had. Never before were mathematics so exciting.The plot is pretty original and at some times it was pretty ""scary"":some things really made sense...What if there were patterns ...?At the end of the movie I thought like Max,I saw what Max saw (the hallucinations which were magnificently pictured) and I felt what he felt. The story wasn't full of twists,nor did Aronofsky spend much time on the characters.This movie is all about the madness and genius of Max,and how he can't live with it anymore.One of the things a lot of people wish,is here depicted as a curse:high intelligence. The whole plot is so bizarre that David Lynch could have made the movie himself,with the only difference that Lynch's visual style isn't this powerful. Sean Gullette is great as Max.This is the only movie I saw him in and I'm still wondering why this is. At my second viewing of the movie,I concentrated more on the soundtrack and it's a pity that it's all contemporary music,otherwise the movie would have been a possible timeless classic.The music is cool,but will it be in 10 years or so? The only downside to this movie is that sometimes Aronofsky KNOWS he is a great director and writer and this results in an undefinable form of arrogance in the movie:at times it seems like Aronofsky is trying to hard to make an intelligent and ""difficult"" movie,just to show off with his talent. We'll definitely hear more about Aronofksy (Requiem for a dream is said to be a great movie and I'm wondering what he's going to make out of his Batman adventure...)

Overrated,"How this piece of art-house schlock ever came to be seriously respected is totally beyond me. Darren Aronofsky's big claim to fame (along with Requiem for a Dream), features Sean Gullette as an obsessed math genius determined to find a pattern in the inner-workings of the stock market, I guess so that he can get really rich. It's implausible that an individual as devoted to ""ideas"" as he claims to be would be so motivated to apply his talent to such a parasitic end, but hey, I guess audiences don't think brilliance is cool anymore unless you use it to hit the big time, which explains the obsession with the Las Vegas card counting geniuses from MIT. Aronofsky's style isn't quite as obnoxious as it would later be in Requiem for a Dream, but it's certainly obnoxious all the same, preferring to film his subject with grainy BW photography and lots of film-schoolish trick shots and fast cutting. Aronofsky ultimately fails to heighten the tension to the extent that he so clearly wishes, he strives for profundity, but Pi remains a simple (albeit moderately clever) thriller, nothing more.

What follows the opening credits is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Aronofsky pumps it so full of bullshit that its only message is the director's, a pathetic ""Look how artistic I am!""

On Fibbonaci,"I'm a physicist; I write fidgety reviews while my code is compiling and it's too late to do any real writing.I'm commenting here because there actually is a theory on the origin of Fibbonaci series in plants, published recently in Physical Review Letters (92, 168102, 2004). The theory works best on cacti, as the author (and I) have observed in Arizona.Spirals are built into the plant when it is very young: so young you can see them forming under an electron microscope. The dome of the growing plant buckles under pressure--you can see the same effect if you pinch a wide swath on the back of your hand, or stretch a piece of plastic. Buckling is often geometrically simple for the same reason soap bubbles form nature's most perfect sphere: it takes the easiest path.Shipman found that when a new spiral forms, it has the same number of arms as the sum of pre-existing arms (the Fibbonaci sequence).Whether the phyllotaxis (leaf arrangement) of cacti and sunflowers can be extended to other things, and whether the discovery is useful--I dunno.A talk by Shipman (a living Max who has gone on to work at the Max Planck Institute) is, at the time I write, available at: http://online.itp.ucsb.edu/online/pattern_c03/shipman/Note, incidentally, that the truth is both less artsy and more beautiful than presented in this movie and in the legions of pseudo-science that accompany this field.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

An abstract piece of work from first-time director Aronofsky,"Pi is Aronofsky's debut feature length piece, and it seems as if it was a pet project to him, but there may be the slight notion that he spent a little too long refining his baby.  Pi comes off like an abstract poem that's just a little too obscure, and no-one is really sure what the poet is trying to achieve, hence the poem comes off as slightly self-indulgent.What Pi does do though is offer an interesting representation of Max Cohen, a brilliant but troubled and obsessive compulsive mathematician, who becomes infatuated with discovering a 216 digit number which will not only unlock the stock market but also reveal the real name of God.  However, the film concentrates not so much on the storyline but prefers to concentrate on effectively displaying the everyday life of Max, from his disturbing migraine attacks to his fear and paranoia of other people.  Ultimately this is a story about Max, and his development from a reclusive maniac to a slightly more normal and younger carbon copy of his mentor Sol Robeson.  The camera changes frequently between putting the audience into the head of Max to watching him in a third person, sometimes almost voyeuristic, fashion. The change of picture quality occasionally highlights this subtle switch.Pi isn't a religious movie, despite the apparent religious content to the plotline.  In fact, the group of Jew's trying to uncover the 216 digit number are presented in no better a light than the group of Wall Street predictive agents threatening Max to present them with the number.  You get the feeling that when Max, towards the beginning of the film, tells Lenny that ""I'm not interested in religion"" that this may be the voice of Aronofsky (a self proclaimed ""classically hypocritical high holiday Jew"") distancing himself from any notion of Pi being religious.Although Pi is original and strangely compelling, it is just Aronofosky wetting his directorial beak and practicing techniques which he will make better use of in his sophomore feature 'Requiem For A Dream', a more accomplished and mainstream film.  If you compare and contrast the two closely, then you will find countless similarities.However as I said, it is original and it is compelling, and it is better than most pap from the Hollywood production line.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Challenging, creative super low budget indie","I don't know if this is as good as my rating, but it's so odd, brave, idiosyncratic and haunting, that I want to forgive it it's flaws.Made on a shoestring, but using those limitation to create a unique look and style, this is a psychological thriller about paranoia and ideas, that puts you inside the lead character's head as he slowly cracks up, trying to figure out the mathematical basis of all life. He gets mixed up with Hassidic Jews who think he may have found the true name of god, and wall street traders who want his secret for riches.Full of surreal touches, it's not always clear what's real and what's in our lead character's head ‚Äì but rather than being annoying, that only pulls you in deeper.

There you may find a lot of esoteric stuff about the Kabbala, Rosicrucians and others. I also liked that it was filmed in ""Chinatown"", where for 4-5 seconds you could see people practicing Tai Chi, or was it Chi Kung?!?

The Most Unpleasant Movies I've Ever Seen,"I would rank this as #1 on my ""worst movies"" list.  Or...it's not so much a terrible movie as it is unpleasant to watch.

The plot was just...so rediculous.  What's bizarre, though...is that WAS really well directed.  I understood perfectly how he felt.  It's just...how he felt was NOT a good feeling.  I wanted to turn it off, but I just HAD to see it all. I lost complete interest in the plot about halfway through...but I'm not sure if the plot was all that important.  It was just...a very unpleasant experience...and I guess I should give this movie more credit than I give most movies that I hated since it was VERY memorable...unlike, say, Gone in 60 Seconds.

A Mesmerizing and Thought-Provoking Journey,"""Pi"" is a brilliant and enigmatic film that captivates the mind and the senses from beginning to end. Directed by Darren Aronofsky, this 1998 psychological thriller stands as a testament to the power of independent cinema, offering a unique and intellectually stimulating experience that is both visually striking and narratively profound.At the core of ""Pi"" is Sean Gullette's riveting performance as Maximillian Cohen, a brilliant but troubled mathematician obsessed with finding a universal pattern in numbers. Gullette's portrayal is intense and deeply compelling, capturing the fragility and fervor of a man teetering on the edge of genius and madness. His descent into obsession and paranoia is portrayed with such authenticity that it grips the audience, making Max's journey both relatable and terrifying.The film's narrative is a fascinating blend of mathematics, mysticism, and psychological thriller. It explores complex themes such as the nature of reality, the search for meaning, and the intersection between science and spirituality. Aronofsky's screenplay is intellectually stimulating, filled with thought-provoking dialogue and intriguing concepts that invite viewers to ponder long after the film ends.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Math...with a heart.,"Pi is a great success. Even without the micro-budget and slipshod filming style qualifiers, it is a fun and challenging flick. Grainy black and white pictures and a ""ghost in the machine"" theme give it instant context. Indeed, the premise as stated by the protagonist (life can be understood and therefore ""read"" in terms of a mathematical system) becomes an acute brain cancer of sorts for the guy. For, as he moves seemingly closer to being able to interpret and ""read"" the world around us vis a vis his ""organic"" data set, the stock market, things become neither controllable nor effable to him. Machinations spin scarily around and migraine headaches sound increasingly fierce warnings as he approaches the still center of understanding.The end-game leads to intellectual brick walls for himself and to exploitation from outside corporate and religious entities. However, all are ignoring the fly in the ointment...A well acted and paced thriller laid over an undercurrent of intellect vs. emotion, I highly recommend Pi.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Nigh On Perfect - A Cinematic Masterpiece That Most People Don't Even Know About...,"I was told by someone in a shop to watch this film. The guy told me that it was a very film-studenty film. I was a film student, so I thought I'd give it a try. The idea of naming a film after a mathematical symbol intrigued me.The film is different from anything I've ever seen. Darren Aronofsky puts the audience directly into the mind of paranoid schizophrenic, Max Cohen, and tells the story of his search for meaning in numbers. If he feels scared, you feel scared. If he feels sick, so do you. This is one of the best directed films I've seen.Mark Margolis' portrayal of Max's mentor, Sol, is more than worthy of an Oscar. Despite his short amount of screen time, Margolis steals the show with biting criticism and incredibly wise teachings. I can't imagine anyone else playing the role now. He was a tour-de-force, and makes the movie worth watching on his own, even without the fantastic direction, excellent script, fascinating storyline, or even Sean Gullette's terrific portrayal.If you haven't seen this film, you're missing out on something that's still fresh now. I cannot fault this film. It messes with your head, whilst giving you a thrilling and spine-tingling story. There are so many wonderful quotes. This is a cinematic masterpiece, and it is a crime that the mainstream audiences of cinema may never watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Passion does not drive men mad...,"...reason does. I can't remember where that quotation's from, but it seems apt in reference to this film. And maybe there's some things that we're just not meant to know, however advanced our science and reason become.You don't see many films from any era that dare to incorporate so many disparate concepts, call themselves thrillers--and live up to the name. Pi is well-acted, tightly paced, and beautifully shot (I'm partial to the dreamlike quality of black-and-white). I was astounded to discover the film only cost 60 grand to make--it puts to shame many Hollywood productions that cost 1000 times that amount.On the negative side, I would have liked to have seen a little more development of the mathematical concepts beyond the pop-math highlights we're given. And why is the film called Pi when that concept gets only a passing reference? But this is a thriller and a character study, and I suppose over-doing the intellectual concepts may have damaged the pacing. I was able to overlook those problems in light of the film's many qualities.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
This movie is about . . . what?,"Interesting commenters' split here: is this movie about math or about painfully rare ways of understanding reality? Count me among those who understand ""Pi"" as a movie about mental illness, one of the 2 or 3 best ever made. I won't disagree w/ the folks who say it's about math or mathematicians, but it sure wasn't for me. I gained no new mathematical insights fr/ this film, but I did get weeks' & acres' worth of different new ways to consider how scary and difficult life must be for folks who do not apprehend the world as I (and I think most of us) do.One other thing this movie was about? Ben Shenkman's acting genius! I saw ""Pi"" when it was first released - in an art house, duh - and years later, after watching ""Angels in America"" on HBO, I was belatedly blown away when someone pointed out to me that Louis was the Guy from Pi. His range leaves me speechless. If Brando and Olivier were still here, they'd be jealous.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Hmmm....,"As a 5 minute music video Pi would be great.  As a 45 minute student film it would be a solid effort.But it needlessly allowed itself to grow into a full length feature film, without enough substance to justify even a mere 85 minutes.Plot? Main character Max is obsessed with numbers and is trying to ""decode"" the world.  That is, he studies nature's patterns believing them to be a gateway to the meaning of life (and stockmarket trends). Max has very little interaction with other people.  He has multiple paranoid locks on his apartment door and spends most of his time crunching numbers on his computer.  Oh, and he is plagued with agonizing headaches.Pi is shot in a high contrast black-and-white film, has quick editing and lots of techno music.  It all perfectly conveys Max's paranoid frantic thoughts.  But until the final scene, nothing ever evolves in the movie. The story is at a stand-still, consisting mainly of Max occasionally narrating his new theories, Max having a migraine, or Max walking briskly down the city sidewalks.  There is a subplot with corporate monsters and a religious sect each trying to exploit Max's talents, but these scenes felt like they were tacked on to fill out the running time.For the record, I am not a fan of movies that contain lots of explosions-yes, I can think.  But after awhile Pi seemed very gimmicky, especially the hyperactive camerawork.""But it's just so darn indie!"", people tell me.  Well, that's not what they really say. But I bet that's what they're thinking. Anyway, I give Pi a 5 out of 10. Worth seeing once for its unusual presentation,  just don't get your hopes up too high.Oh yes, my favorite part of the movie is when Max's mentor criticizes Max for being obsessed with finding the number 216.  The older guy tells Max that if he wants to find the number, he will make himself see it everywhere (216 feet from here to the end of the street, 216 steps on a flight of stairs, etc.). ""you will have ceased to be a mathematician, and become a numerologist!"".  That made me chuckle.  And if any of your friends are astrologists or numerologists you might laugh, too.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Useless confusion,"""Pi"" is unlike mainstream movies of all kinds, but for good reason. There's just no point in all this drivel, and Aronofsky treats the audience like idiots. Just like mindless cultists, people will follow this film down its narrow-minded path, searching for its devine meaning, but there is none. On the surface, Max searches for the meaning of life through a long number, like he's really going to find anything. In the core, there's nothing there; Max finds no interesting answers to any of the non-questions he searches for, just like anyone watching this over-indulgent garbage. There have been alot of good indie films about the meaning of life, but this is scraping the bottom of the manipulative barrel. Lack of color and a techno soundtrack don't make a film inventive, and the director would have you believe the plots very complicated, but in truth it's just very dumb.",,Anonymous,Horror
Negative Capability,"Max is an obsessed genius falling ever more deeply into migraine-ridden madness. As he himself suggests, his life has been about staring into the sun. What makes this film so powerful is its unflinching first person point of view as Max follows his harrowing path. Director Aronofsky's camera assaults us with starkly lit, B&W images that heighten characterization and sometimes strobe and make moires that blind us; the sounds often disengage us from the images, while film editing dislocates time. From the first moments of the film we are Max; his alienation is palpable, sometimes the pulsing of his nausea is as well.This ride is harrowing, and not just the horror scenes, so much so that some will be put off. For me it is cinema at its most cinematic. Aronofsky makes Max's mental state palpable through cinematography. As Max spirals into self-destruction he also reaches for the mathematical beauty, the pattern that underlies all the forms in the universe. This opens the cinematography to a wonderful range of imagery handled so as to leave the audience to ponder possible symbolic resonances. The final beauty of the film rests in the fact that this is a tale told by a hallucinating madman. We may think we know what is real and what is his hallucination. Then again, most of us have awakened from nightmares unsure where dream stops and reality begins. This leaves fundamental questions of the film interestingly ambiguous: Is it the mathematical vision that short circuits Max's brain or is it all those drugs he's taking? Is that strange computer rig that envelopes his apartment a machine for solving fundamental questions, or is it merely the externalization of Max's agoraphobic, claustrophobic mindscape? Is the universe based on fundamental order or is the order Max sees merely the shape of chaos? The film does no more than pose the question.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

When power clouds the radical mind,"Based on a concept that many major thinkers have always suspected and strived to decipher, ""Pi"" is not afraid to break boundaries of any type. The idea is repeated many, many times through the film, in the exact same consecutive phrases leading to the conclusion that there is a certain code in nature that if broken would lead to enlightenment. Well, alright, I take back what I said earlier about redundancy in code-breaking. Kind of. You see, Max Cohen is trying to find the big one. But he's not the only one. Count the badguys in this film and you'll be left wondering why he even bothers. You'd think that the answer to life itself would be more readily shared with the public in today's age of mass communication. On the contrary, we find that greed does indeed outdo a do-gooder.Hidden deeper, though, the truth that Max Cohen may actually be the wrong guy to try is inevitable. After all, we had dudes in the past who claimed enlightenment. One was hung to death, one disappeared in a forest, and one, well, reportedly ""prayer-dueled"" himself to death. Look at the number of digits he seems to be so attached to. 216 = 6x6x_ . I'll let you fill in the blank. Use a calculator if you have to, I won't consider it cheating.Despite the scratchiness, the camera lens never seems to do anything unnecessary. In fact, this may be the beginning of a new age of film-making and we never even knew it. Matthew Libatique and Darren Arronofsky (who also wrote the of course ingenious script) are claimed to have invented the technique of the ""hip hop montage"" in cinema. In which the score (brilliantly executed by Clint Mansell) guides the viewer through a series of moving frames. The acting is superb on every count. Even the little girl next door seems to take on some sort of magic, emphasized by her last question to Max as he descends down the stairwell of the project building they share together. 748 divided by 238. Well, it's close, at least.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Overpraised and pretentious,"It may at first seem like a good attempt for a film with a $60k budget. However, the director shamelessly imitates Eraserhead most of the time. Also, the science in the film - mathematics, chaos, stock market, God etc. - is just ridiculous for anyone who has read one or two science books in his life. The overall result is like a 60's bizarre B-movie. The reason that this film was so highly praised is probably that it makes idiots feel really clever after watching it (I have met some of them that said it has changed their life). Dear Dr. Aronofsky, if you want a lesson on how to make an original film on low budget, go rent a copy of Clerks and watch it many times over. And next time, consult a mathematician before trying to explain the universe.",,Anonymous,Horror
Aronofsky's tale of obsession and mathematical patterns,"Pi is definitely one of the most remarkable achievements in the world of indie productions. On such a low budget (mere 60 thousand dollars) Darren Aronofsky was able to create an intelligent, engaging, mathematically overflowing movie that stands out in comparison to all the blockbusters that came out in 1998.It is a thorough study of madness and chaos, two strategically opposing matters, yet so closely connected in the film's storyline. The main character believes that when he will finally discover and establish a special pattern, which can be found in nature, he will be able to control simply anything, and the pure reason for our existence will be revealed. It's a risky game, where there are only rights and wrongs, nothing in between.The main character ‚Äì Maximilian Cohen ‚Äì is an obsessive-compulsive, frightened, and detached from community, man. He barricades himself from the world in his own apartment, filled with computers. His mind is gradually imploding, due to reoccurring headaches and paranoid visions that attack him in various, random moments. His only friend is an old mathematician, a mentor, with whom he plays a fantastic Japanese game called Go (the sequences remind me of the thrilling book 'The Master of Go' by Yasunari Kawabata).Max's problems begin when two groups try to seduce him, in order to acquire a bit of that genius, which lies inside his troubled mind: A Wall Street firm on one side, and Hasidic Jews on the other. He is looking for a 216-digit number, which will bring enormous wealth for the former, and shine a new light on the understanding of religion for the latter.The film is shot in a very unconventional manner, mostly in black and white (kind of a neo-noir feel), with the use of a, so-called, chestcam (camera attached to the body of an actor), which improves the connection between the character's actions and the viewer's perception of them. Great music only increases the pace and plays very well with the scenes of precise mathematic divagations.Even though the movie's storyline is strictly connected to the brilliant mathematic ideas and notions, it can be certainly called a thriller. Max is in danger all the time, risking his precious mind in order to pursue an obsession. He can't trust anyone, as the people surrounding him don't care about him as a person, but only about what's in his head. He becomes angrier and angrier every minute, and gradually creates his own demise.Pi is Aronofsky's fantastic debut, and a movie that through the complicated (but easy to follow for the regular viewer) mathematical problems and expressions is able to depict a tragic story about mental obsession. I would recommend it to anyone, whether a math geek or a theoretical newbie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
3.14159265358979,"My favorite film in the world is ""Cube,"" and one of the things that made me like it was the usage of half-complex mathematics to enhance the plot. (I don't see primes as being truly complex unless it goes into over 2 digits, but since it used 3-digit primes, that made it more complex.) Remembering some time after seeing ""Cube"" about some film called ""Pi,"" I looked at the plot, and found myself wanting to see it so much that I memorized 15 digits of pi before watching it. (3.14159265358979)Some things about ""Pi"" aren't perfect, such as the fact that the ""supercomputer"" Max built uses those big floppy disks, long outdated even in 1998, and the idea of a 216-digit number actually enabling someone to see everything (i.e. the upcoming numbers on the stock market), but those are minor complaints. The movie introduced me to such theories as the golden ratio, theta, golden rectangle, spirals in everything, etc. (Note: I'm almost out of 6th grade--not a safe age to watch this at--so if I seem to not have heard of something they introduced in high school, that's why. Also, I'm using the names given in the film, so if they're wrong, I haven't learned their correct names.) The movie actually has a reason for using weird music--for example, the music playing whenever Max has a headache almost makes you have a headache (possibly when combined with black-and-white photography).Rating: 10 out of 6 (almost as good as ""Cube"")",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pi: 8/10,"Darren Aronofsky, I guess, could be called a film genius. Requiem for a Dream is considered to be one of the best movies of recent memory (and, from what I saw of it, I can agree), and has many of the same techniques as his previous film, Pi. Pi is one of those movies that you need to see many times in order to have everything sink in, but you don't really want to see it again. The images stick in your head, and it's a subconsciously terrifying experience.Max Cohen (Sean Gullette) is a mathematical genius. He analyzes numbers, and soon recognizes a pattern in the stock market. But that doesn't satisfy him. He keeps on going, as people want to use his mathematical abilities for their own selfish reasons. Max struggles with his various mental and physiological problems as he's working with this-so much that if you watch it once you can't distinguish between reality and Max's mind.Aronofsky makes this movie on parking meter money (less than $10,000), yet it's one of the most stylish movies of recent memory. Shot in black/white (there is barely any grey) with a type of vision that leaves edges to the imagination, Pi works in its own little world. With a short runtime that's shorter than Dennis Miller on one of his longwinded analogies, it works. The theories that the movie puts in your head are complete bull-honky, but they're presented in a way that you can't help believing (like many people think about Michael Moore).Well acted all around, especially by Guellette, Pi is not for everyone. There's many disturbing moments, involving brains and power tools. The second-to-last scene, just so you know, was actually done, no special effects. Overall, Pi is a very good, trippy movie that's not for everyone. But if you're game, go for it.My rating: 8/10Rated R for language and some disturbing images.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

I think the problem a lot of people have with this movie is that they felt they were going to watch a math film, but instead they get a film with a broader message. Whats so great about this film is it takes two subjects, science and religion, and creates a link, and as soon as this film goes beyond the mathamatics of it all and journeys to the unexplained is where you completely lose your math audience and it seems they don't make the connection that is necessary to fully comprehend this movie and its message.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
An anxious mimalist stylized black and white cult film.,"This is a love letter to pure mathematics, but you don't need to be a math expert to love it. Although the advertising for this one makes it seem like a cryptic mind-bender, it's less focused on plot twists and more focused on frantic emotions.The main character is a recluse mathematician who is very sick, barely gets sleep and relies on amphetamines to push himself to his limits of cracking the one formula that's the solution to the world. Of course, he is guided by his old wise mentor who practices his mathematical algorithms in the seemingly simple but very complex game of Go.As an indie film, it doesn't have grand locales, CGI or big-budget action, which is a good thing.

You don't need to be a math genius to understand.,"Pi is about a mathematician, but you do not even need a rudimentary knowledge of mathematics to understand the true wonder of this film.  The math is simply a tool to tell the story.  The real subject of this film is a how a person can be consumed by their beliefs and obsessions and also that there is a very fine line between genius and madness.  Max begins this movie towards the top of a downward spiral and ""Pi"" follows him as he moves toward rock bottom with increasing speed and intensity. His rapid decline can be attributed to his obsession with proving his theory or his getting too close to knowledge that was never meant to be understood by man.  The movie wisely allows you to decide for yourself.Like all great directors, Darren Aronofsky knows when to make a film and when to stop making a film.  By avoiding spoon-fed answers and an easy ending, he allows the viewer to arrive at his own conclusions and make his own decisions, just as Max had to do in the movie's climax.  This movie is a cinematic milestone that will only achieve greater appreciation in the years to come.",,Anonymous,Horror
An interesting portrait of insanity.,"This movie was an incredible and intense portrait of a man balancing on the brink of insanity. It centers on Max, a mathematics and computer type who is obsessed with finding a mathematical expression for the stock market. Max has some sort of medical condition which leads him to have tremors, blackouts, and violent outbursts. He is a very private person who doesn't really enjoy personal interaction (probably because of his illness) . The only person he interacts with in a semi-normal way is his mentor and former teacher who also shares a love for numbers.There are a few problems with the script but they are all excusable. For example, at one point, there is a discussion of turning a 216 digit number into a 216 letter word but clearly that would not be possible under the circumstances. I'm probably being picky but that was a little silly considering that Max is supposed to be a mathematical genius. Plus, there are some sub-plots that never really go anywhere. The girl next door seems to like Max and he seems to go into his blackouts when she is with other men but the romance is never fully explored.These types of inconsistencies keep it from being a 10/10 film but they are actually pretty minor when compared to the rest of the film. The scenes where Max has tremors and goes into his blackouts are intense and show a man truly on the edge of sanity. His obsession with solving the ""pi"" project and its effect on the frequency and intensity of his episodes is acted out and timed to perfection bringing the whole story to an mind blowing finale.This movie is more of a portrait of insanity rather than a ""thriller"" but probably of interest to the same audience. Definitely worth renting.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"A movie about a number theorist, not number theory","As Max Cohen's mentor Sol Robeson hinted at, we, as humans, simply can't understand some things. We're supposed to believe that a single man, even as ingenious as Max, can find one number that essentially unlocks the secrets of the universe? This is the most obvious flaw in this movie: it is logically implausible. At first, this bothered me because I thought, ""This movie is about math, so why isn't it more accurate?"" However, I realized that if I wanted a lesson on number theory, I wouldn't be watching an indie flick, so I sat back and enjoyed the ride. The acting wasn't the best, of course, and the plot had its share of holes. But when all is said and done, this was a unique and enjoyable film with interesting visuals and one of the best soundtracks to come out in a long time.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Close but No Cigar,"Despite an intriguing premise, I found this an unsatisfying movie. All that information about math and patterns was supposed to amount to what? There was no payoff, nothing to reward me for paying attention. The movie didn't spend much energy exploring relationships or developing its main character. Because it's a concept movie.But high concept or not, I need to see real people dealing with real problems. I didn't see the hero pursue a goal. I saw him cope with headaches, ward off neighbors and escape villains. But I didn't know what he was after, and therefore couldn't identify with him. I lost interest two thirds of the way in.Pi is a smart, unrealized movie that hasn't figured out what it wants to say to the viewer.",,Anonymous,Horror
newton's laws  = crazy,"This is one of the weirdest movies I have ever seen but also one of the more interesting. The plot follows this genius Max who attempts to find, not only the key to the stock market, but the key to the universe. Max is your typical reticent genius who just wants to be left alone. He has a problem with his brain and throughout the movie, the drama unfolds and we watch his mind torture him. Meanwhile, we have Jews that are very interested in this number that Max has uncovered and then there are these other people who are also very interested in this number.This is an amazing film and can be interpreted in many ways. The story is truly about Max's mental stress. The plot between the Jews and the other people is very loosely developed but that's the point; the point is to dramatize and emphasize Max's mental state. This movie is a piece of work. As you watch your mind seemingly gets entranced and it's as if you are developing your own theories.I seriously recommend watching this movie. It can get disturbing, but this twilight - zone - esque film, is truly mind boggling and will have you thinking about its concepts the whole day.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Good but not original.,"The plot is not as original as many reviewers seem to think. After 10 minutes I found myself wondering if the screenplay had been based loosely on Umberto Eco's ""Foucault's Pendulum"" (which was published around 1990). As the film went on I became more and more convinced I was right.Anyway, this is an interesting film but not to most people's taste I suspect (if you like crap such as ""Independence Day"" and buddy cop films then give ""Pi"" a miss!). I did find the use of monochrome film very pretentious!I wouldn't call this ""Sci-Fi"" but then that's not the film's fault.If you enjoyed this film then I recommend you read ""Foucault's Pendulum"".9/10 including 2 bonus points for not being predictable boring crap like 99.999% of the rubbish Hollywood churns out.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The only Mathematical Fiction/Thriller I have ever seen.,"A reclusive genius is on the verge of discovering that the number Pi is a magic number that will prove that the apparent randomness in the world has a predictable pattern.

Two disparate, desperate groups are after this work, one an investment firm and the other a Kabbalist group who believe that the pattern in the number represents the true name of God. This low-budget, black-and-white film was nominated for 11 awards and it won five of them, including the Director's Award at the Sundance Film Festival. I watched it twice before returning it.

American Pi...,"""Mathematics is the language of nature,"" vents offbeat number theorist Max Cohen (Sean Gullette) in the midst of one of his lofty rants. ""Everything around us can be understood and represented through numbers."" Words hard to fathom; spoken from the protagonist's experience and belief, yes, but the man speaks quite brilliant sense in writer/director Darren Aronofsky's astounding debut feature. So much so, that Max's compulsive efforts to decode the alleged numerical order underpinning the stock-market exert a pull on corporate kingpins set on economic rule and Jewish fantasists intent on deciphering the secrets behind their holiest of texts.In a periolous obsession that leads to all kinds of hypotheses regarding ecology and mysticism, money, faith and existence, Max's mental and physical robustness is pushed to the very edges of endurance as he inches towards a specific sequence of digits that could shatter the very foundations of Wall-street and beyond.Darren Aronofsky's stylistically shot and conceived parable revels in the sheer freedom of experimental film-making in what is, essentially, a character study that relentlessly probes at the known and unknown, the surreal and sublime.You don't have to be good Will Hunting to grasp the tale, though. Pi is a very well executed sci-fi thriller that grips and stirs in a way that'll leave you yearning for the answers and more. Maths can actually be insightful and cool. Who'd have thought it!?Shot on a shoe-string budget, this enigmatic indie hits a new peak of low-budget, original film-making. It looks and sounds unlike anything else around. The equation is exact and apt. The film-making techniques: astute and brash. And it all adds up, in quite exceptional yet enigmatic style.The eccentricity kicking in from the opening credits, an ultramodern manifestation scored by the erratic, techno-rave beats of Clint Mansell's paranoid soundtrack. The Coventry-born musician strikes a forbidding note throughout with his atmospheric composition which compliments the aesthetical and narrative content well.Darren Aronofsky's Pi is a truly haunting and ingenious discussion on man's undying efforts to crack the complex codes behind our very existence. It has cult potential written all over it. Innovative quality running rich throughout and boasts all the awe and intrigue as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter....honest; ""3.14 and off into infinity"".",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fascinating yet a bit flawed,"There are lots of exciting things in this film that I have seen many times, the metaphysical themes, the urban aesthetic partly inspired by Tetsuo, the voiceover repetitions...
But something is fundamentally holding it back from being a great film. Which, in my humble opinion, has been repeated throughout Aronofsky's filmography. The mise-en-scene is sometimes a little too pushed and a bit gross through excessive shots. Some developments are also a little too easy, recounting Max's persecution without enough ambiguity when perhaps a line of indecision between possible paranoia and actual persecution should have been found. It is nonetheless a film worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

I've discovered another magic number.,"While watching this film I discovered a magic number with very great significance. It is 89. Take the duration of a film in minutes. The closer the film runs to this magic number, 89 mins, the less entertaining it is. Saturn 3 and The Avengers are just 2 examples that spring to mind. They're under an hour and a half so the poor viewer continues to watch knowing that even if it doesn't get any better it least it'll end soon.Pi runs for 84 minutes.Hey, I've just discovered another one. 7.5!

A Great Movie Despite Conceptual Flaws (No Spoilers),"I rate movies mainly on how entertaining they are to me as I watch the movie, and I couldn't keep my eyes off the TV while watching Pi. I felt the ending was great. I can understand if some people may not agree. However, I don't think the movie is lacking in plot as some people say.I think the movie was written by more of a philosopher than a mathematician or scientist. There's little rationality behind the concepts. Some mathematical principles are applied in the movie, but are used incorrectly or without complete understanding of the entire picture. To an average, educated adult, the writer will seem a little silly and naive.I don't think this movie is an intellectual movie. Those people that think the movie is so brilliant in its reasoning are fools, I'm sorry to say. However, I think the movie is very *clever*. Though completely unbelievable, the wrong associations and conclusions the movie makes are very, very clever. :)The basic plot is centered around one simple concept (and one which is completely unbelievable as I stated earlier), but I thought it was very well presented. The acting is top-notch in my opinion. I really liked the old scientist, Saul.The entire movie seems to be like a really long music video. The techno music really adds to the intensity. I think someone brilliantly described the movie earlier by stating that it reminded him/her of a Nine-Inch-Nails music video. The scenes reminded me of movies like The Matrix. The movie is repetitious at times in the scenes, but I think everything worked out well.This is one of my favorite movies so far. I give it a 9/10. However, I don't expect many people to agree with me, since it is a really bizarre movie, dialogue is minimal, concepts are screwy, etc.",,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent,"I would have never watched this film had it not been for a chance meeting with a friend who happened to have the movie with him at the time.  I had heard of it but knew nothing about its content.  Imagine my surprise when what I saw was some of the best filmmaking I had seen in quite a while.What I really enjoyed about this film was its complete innovation.  A film looking into the dark and deep depths of insanity is usually done through the outside world...through outside eyes looking in.  This movie, however, was the complete reverse of that look.  We look at insanity through the eyes of the insane looking outward.  What we saw was disturbing, heart-wrenching, and brilliant.Acting was tremendous in this film; there were very few speaking roles, but they were all done excellently.  The music was a perfect addition to the film.  It supported what we were seeing to a tee.  The black and white just added crudeness, honesty, and mystery to what we were seeing.  It almost made me think that Maximillian Cohen saw the world in black and white...with a lot of gray in between.  A great way to show us his world, in other words. Cinematography was brilliant, and the screenplay was very well written. All come together to make quite a memorable film.Mark Margolis gave one of the best supporting performances I have seen.  I question Sol's motive in this film.  Was he the voice of sanity?  Reason? Was he himself insane?  Whatever the case, he brought at least what seemed like a little more sanity to Maximillian's life.Another memorable performance (or scene, if one can look at it that way) is that of Stephen Pearlman.  Playing Rabbi Cohen (Notice that this is the same last name as Maximillian.), the scene can be remembered for its sheer acting talent and for the message it brought.  Is religion in itself insanity? What was the religion's main goal here?  To know the name of God no matter what?  How far would they go?  Would they care that something happens to whoever was in the way?  This scene basically shows what Maximillian was seeing...the world was after him, after his knowledge.Contrast that to his personality:  He saw society as constantly ""chasing him"" and unacceptable.  So what were we seeing throughout the film?  The world coming after him?  Or what appeared to be the world coming after him?This brings the bigger question...what did we see which was sane?  Insane? That is the real beauty of this film.  It makes you think on a basic level about insanity.  Can we really draw a line between it?  What causes his insanity?  His quest for more knowledge?  Or is that his mode of medication?A lot of questions are presented in this film, but that was the intent.  Our job is to think about it, and after seeing this film, it has consumed my mind.  Perhaps as consumed as Maximillian's mind was. Hmm...8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""I'm trying to understand our world. I don't deal with petty materialists like you.""","""When I was a little kid, my mother told me not to stare into the sun, so when I was six I did...""Darren Aronofsky's films usually centre around the eternal struggle of obsession and its damaging effects it has on people's lives. Pi is a very impressive debut from Darren Aronofsky, Aronofsky acknowledged influences such as Tetsu: The Iron Man - the visual style of Pi and Requiem for a Dream would have numerous similarities to Tetsuo: The Iron Man. It just goes to prove what you can do with tremendous talent and a very small budget - we have seen this before: Shinya Tsukamoto's first film was Tetsuo: The Iron Man (1989), Christopher Nolan's first film was Following (1998), David Lynch's first film was Eraserhead (1977) and Shane Carruth's first film was Primer (2004). All these directors had one thing in common; they had a minuscule budget to work with - but these debut films allowed their talent to shine through.Pi is effectively a study of a man who is driven to madness in the quest for greatness. The arousing aspect of Pi is that it is feasible in terms of the math and modern physics. Pi would share some similarities with Primer (2004) - in terms of math and modern physics, but also the complex scientific dialogue that is exhibited in both of these films. Pi would also share some similarities with Abel Ferrara's The Addiction (1995) in terms of both been shot in black and white and set in a grimy gritty New York.Pi is centred around Chaos Theory which looks for patterns in nature through the use of mathematics. Unemployed number theorist Max Cohen (Sean Gullette) would be driven to near insanity for the search that everything in nature can be understood through numbers. This would be exhibited through paralysing headaches, paranoia, and hallucinations. You never truly know whether Max is on the verge of a breakthrough, or a breakdown, or both.Pi would explore many different themes such as obsession, mental illness, mysticism, and meaning in the world. As I said previously this is truly low budget film making at its very best, and would forever determine the direction of travel in Aronofsky's films in terms of visuals and themes.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good First Film,"I saw pi a little while ago, I never thought to comment on it, not that i didn't like it or anything, it just never crossed my mind. Now that i have seen Requiem For A Dream, I feel that I should put in my two cents about this movie. I have to say that I found the film inspiring. It shows that you don't need money, magor stars, and tons of experience in Hollywood to make a good film. This movie shows that if you have a good idea and alot of talent that you can produce a work of art that just smacks people in the face. Defently a must see for anybody interested in movies and how far one can really go with film. If you plan on seeing Requiem for a dream, make a point to see this one first, that way you can appreciate the growth that Arnofsky went threw between the two projects. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very Effective Filmmaking on a Limited Budget,"At first glance, ""Pi"" appears to be nothing more than another confusing, depressing, supposedly metaphorical independent film. Yes, it is all of those things, but there is more to it than that. It deals with a fascinating concept, one that is not often discussed by anyone but mathematicians and numerologists: the evidence of predictable patterns in nature. And it does an outstanding job of portraying the field of mathematics as an interesting topic.   But, as mentioned before, ""Pi"" is an independent film, and therefore, the filmmakers have intertwined loads of symbolism and artistic cliches into the film, sometimes unnecessarily so. As a result, ""Pi"" is more of a critic's film than a normal person's film. 4/5",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Proof that Aronofsky was a genius even before REQUIEM FOR A DREAM...,"It is only human nature to question existence, and to try to find some patterned order in the seemingly random chaos that is life. For Mathematician Max Cohen, the universal language of Mathematics is the only rational way to find the order in the chaos.In a wonderfully fresh and unique film, Darren Aronofsky explores the nature of chaos and one troubled man's relentless pursuit to find some answer to it all. Shot in black-and-white to give the film a more artistic impression, the cinematography is quite brilliant, as is the score, which fully conveys the overall mood of the film. Sean Gullette is perfectly cast as Cohen, and he fits into the character extremely well. Almost too well. To me the real star is an up-and-coming director named Darren Aronofsky.PI is a wonderful and freshly weird Motion Picture that will appeal to most. 8/10. 3 stars (out of 4) A marvellously ambitious effort by a director who seems unafraid to take challenges head-on.

PI at times seems a bit too pretentious, but always manages to redeem itself by its utter simplicity. Even the antiquated computer parts lend credence to the timeliness of this movie. Few movies are truly meant to be in black-and-white, but this is one of them. The stark, frenetic energy of the video sequences helps build everything to a relentless crescendo.

I suggest, you read some popular scientific articles about irrational numbers. You might find it more interesting than this movie.The movie could appear as an interesting artistic effort, but if you can see under the crust, you'll see it's a wannabe artsy flick written by people who don't exactly know what they are writing about.

Can you make a good thriller out of mathematics? You bet!,"What an amazing piece of film-making, all on a shoestring budget! And from such odd beginnings, too. The idea that you could make an exciting, tense, and thought-provoking film based around mathematical computations is absurd. But this is exactly what the filmmakers created with ""Pi"".Although the math clearly takes a focal point in the story, it's really just a vehicle for investigating what happens when a man gone mad. Paranoia, obsession, aggravation, grief, with tiny bits of joy (as shown by his interactions with a little girl): all parts of a man descending into insanity. So brilliantly crafted by the writer, so brilliantly portrayed by the actor, it's this descent that makes ""Pi"" so fascinating.This is a film that uses symbolism to the Nth degree. This is the closest thing an American has ever gotten to an Ingmar Bergman film. You've got science, and religion, and philosophy, and the origins of universe, and the essence of thought, and the stuff of life. The film is just chock-full of suggestions on all of these things.In the end, we aren't entirely sure what happened to to the main character. Did he suffer a debilitating attack, thereby losing his genius? Or was he cured of his affliction, of which genius was only a symptom? In the end, there is a question on an old adage. If there is a fine line between genius and insanity, is the corollary that there is a wide split between genius and happiness? This film surely suggests that.Overall, a deep, thoughtful piece. Shot on a shoestring, so don't expect much in terms of film quality. But it's a fine work nonetheless.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

I considered it the equivalent of reading Neuromancer by William Gibson:  it's only enjoyable if you resign yourself to the fact that you probably won't understand most of what's going on. Pi is about a lot of things, really; it's about a mad but brilliant mathematician trying to discover the secret of the number, it's about a group of religious Jews trying to find the secret to communicating with God, and it's about teetering on the brink of insanity.  It's well worth renting and sitting through, despite the fact that it's barely understandable, although it's not the type of film that you want to watch twice.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Absolutely awful,"The camerawork is abominable, the acting is terrible, the story is vile - math genius is, naturally, nuts - the characters are anti-Semitic stereotypes (the paranoid genius slob, the older failure with a central European accent, the super-aggressive Hasid). I cannot say whether the movie improves after the first half hour or so, as I turned it off in utter disgust, but given what I saw I cannot believe that anyone involved in this trash would be able to put together a coherent scene.

A rare visual and mind boggling story.,"I am already a sci-fi lover and films like these in which a scientific thought is explored always intrigue me. And I still remember the day when I first watched it (writing this after the second viewing). The moment the film ended that time I knew this director will impress me every time. And I was not wrong. The films of Darren aronofsky have always been one of my favorite. So in this debut film of him he has very nicely explored the concept of mathematics. Well not to worry because like many other films it does not stumbles on the grounds of too much technical, it has some very disturbing scenes which some people might find ugly but the visuals and the way they are presented are remarkable. It has succeeded in exploring the mind of the mathematician. The most impressing part is that it was made on a very little budget and we have a film with a much higher quality. This one is already in my favorites list. And I forgot to mention about the soundtrack of Clintmansel which is amazing.""A must watch for everyone regardless of taste.""",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

want a mind-f***? skip and see Aronofsky's later work: Requiem,"Look, this movie was cleverly done in high-contrast black and white and even though it was very noir-ish, there was a lot of blinding white used. However, the fact still remains that this movie was droll and boring. The acting was nothing short of mediocre and whatever chemistry there was supposed to be between Max and Devi was lost somewhere in the unbelievability that she would give such an antisocial neurotic as max.Like i said, someone got the idea that Darren Aronofsky is the master of the mind-f*** and thus, everyone likes to say that PI is much more clever than it actually is. The tiny pill-popping montages are much more well-implemented in Requiem for a Dream. Also, the ending of Requiem leaves a ""woah"" feeling in the pit of your stomach masterfully and this movie does not.The fact of the matter is, the movie doesn't grab your attention and thus cannot keep it. As a result, you never develop any sort of relationship with the characters. At the end you see it and just ask, ""Ok, what else can i watch?""",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Totally Senseless and Extremely Boring!,This movie is really awful. It was one of the cases when you get deceived by the rating of the movie. I really thought that it would be a good movie.

But what they showed in the movie was disappointing. The story is senseless. The acting was bad.

I hope Mr. Lynch didn't feel too bad when something so pitiful and pathetic was compared to his masterpiece.The story was a neat idea about the mystery of number systems and how it controls modern civilization but the mathematics used in the movie are so elementary that it looks like a joke.

Collage of great shot making,"This movie is best viewed as a collage of great camera shots. It is best understood as a movie used at film school to understand the affect of good shot making. Really the ideas for the camera placement and angles and the way the shots communicate the characters mindset are fantastic, perfect even in some cases.If you really understood mathematics you would see the hole in the Hassidic Jews request for a number of so many digits. But if you aren't comfortable with math, what little is presented could intimidate you. So from a mathematics standpoint, this movie appeals to no one.The acting is fantastic, especially with the camera mounted where it is in some shots. Sean Gullete, as Max Cohen, can really concentrate and stay in character. It was all very believable.All in all though this is a depressing story of a man living alone in Chinatown who struggles with his curse of being a genius.

"Not believable, and not great","One of the reviews of Pi I read on IMDB said this movie blended elements of number theory, Go, computer science, Wall Street,... into a solute of paranoid genius (I am paraphrasing from memory so please forgive me). I think one word in that sentence is off. The word 'genius' should be replaced with 'mess'. Pi does contain all the said elements, but this movie is just too silly to be taken seriously.Many people have commented that this film's storyline borders on illogical towards the second half. I would go as far as to say it is laughable. Whatever intrigue they had generated was completely demolished once the second half reared its ugly head. Self-aware computers? The 216-letter name of God? Please, there are real uses for number theory, you don't need to invent stupid ones. Don't expect the plot to win you back after that till the end. The chase scenes aren't particularly intense (mostly because you can't see what's going on) and the story just gets sillier and sillier. In fact, if I didn't think the ending was great (truly a saving grace, even though it's a copout), I would have hated this movie. Instead, the ending shed a new light on the past 85 minutes and reassured me that what I thought was laughable indeed was intended to be. However, I don't think the film is brilliant or even clever for having done this; I still had to subject myself to 85 minutes (or at least 40 minutes) of meandering plot just to appreciate the ending, and I don't think it was worth it.With that, we get to the technical side. The film is shot in black and white and the camera work is very shaky. Add this to an overall bleak setting and you get cinematography and mood perfect for the film. Unfortunately, it's not the kind of thing that's bearable for 85 minutes. I enjoyed the first few paranoiac episodes, but as they got longer and more frequent, I started to get overwhelmed by the headache-inducing camera work (as Max must have been). One thing that was always spot on however was the music. Most of the music used in the film is techno, and it always suits the film, whether during a subway scene or a paranoiac episode. Probably the highlight of the film and I would recommend the soundtrack.One last thing: I thought it was funny when Saul explained to Max about Archimedes and the displacement problem. I thought everybody knew that story, especially mathematicians.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Mathematics as a Science of the Poor in Spirit?,"I do not want to comment on the film as a whole, but only on one aspect of it, namely on how it depicts the central topic of mathematics.The main problem with this movie is that it deals with potentially very interesting stuff, but in a rather imbecile way. If you happen to have some elementary knowledge concerning mathematics, you will soon realize that the creators of this film probably do not. They simply have no idea of what mathematics is about and what a genius in mathematics might occupy himself with. The result is irritating.The ""genius mind"" of Max Cohen looks like pictured by a 10-year-old child: he knows how to multiply and divide large numbers. That's about all. The ""mysterious"" ideas he is haunted by fall in two categories: some are merely common knowledge, or at least they are very old and all the people interested in the subject generally know them (e.g. the golden ratios, Galileo's ideas about the mathematics as a language of nature, etc.); the remaining ones are merely ridiculous: the search for the number that is the key to the universe, i.e. the old Pythagorean idea taken literally, rid of the context in which it can make sense.Unfortunately, this film deals with no mystery.

If you know more about mathematics/computing and medicine/psichiatry than a 14-year old, you'll be utterly disappointed by the dullness of the plot.

Amateurish Silliness,"This film is so sophomoric, it's hard not to laugh through most of it. Vague, silly associations are made, conspiracies are hinted at, boredom ensues. Everything from computers to stocks and the Kabbalah are cartoonified.There's actually a lot of opportunity for funny, deconstructive unintended readings. For instance, the protagonist being pursued by the attractive woman who just wants to manipulate his genius is simultaneously played straight as pity for the brilliant man and offers an hilarious alternate reading as pure wish fulfillment. But ultimately, the fact that nothing happens there is the most thorough indictment of this film: there is literally nothing human in it at all. Though one of the worst possible offenses is to weave silly personal interest nonsense into interesting material, uninteresting material without a spec of personal interest is actually even worse.The protagonist musters less interest than Dennis peaking through Mr. Wilson's hedge.

Eventually audiences would no longer tolerate it, and it fell by the wayside. Good Lord, can anyone remember how to set a camera down and film?

What a miss,"I swear, what this movie has going for it as far as getting the audience interested in the theories the main character has, it totally misses on the character level.

Parts of the film are tough to take without a fast forward button, because the recurring ""trips"" are pointless, boring and irritating. And there are many such trips....too many. A lot of metaphors are lost and the movie loses by being centered around the theorist instead of the theories. A thoroughly unlikable main character, even if the performer behind him is pretty damn good, is what spoils this one.This movie was hyped as a great indie film, I think it did well technically, but artistically, it belongs in Mystery Science Theatre 3000 right down there with ""Manos - the Hands of Fate"".

Confusing plot + irritating presentation = a very long 90 min.,"I watched Pi as part of a film making class for school. As much as I tried, I simply could not get into this movie. I know it's hailed as a great indie film and has a cult following, but I didn't enjoy it.The plot revolves around a mathematician named Max. Max is convinced that everything in nature is governed by math and, therefore, predictable. He takes this theory and does considerable research into the stock market, trying to see if he can predict it. On some level, he succeeds and attracts some people who wish to exploit this knowledge for personal gain (one is a businesswoman of some sort looking to use this information for money, the other is a group of Jews trying to find answers about God). To add to his troubles, Max suffers from recurring, very intense headaches.I wish I could say I know all this from my actual viewing, but I can't. The fact is, this movie is so confusing it's very hard to tell what's going on at any given point. This doesn't sink the film for me, though. I've sat through and enjoyed many films that were very confusing. What sinks this film for me is the visual style. The movie is shot in black and white due to the lack of funding and whatnot. This gives the film a very gritty look. On top of that is the soundtrack, which is very unpleasant (especially during his headache sequences because of a loud, high pitched screech that plays). All of this coupled with the disturbing and paranoid nature of the script makes for a very uncomfortable experience. For some, this may work, but not for me. These two factors (confusing script and irritating audio/visual style) led me to hate this film roughly 20 minutes into it. One another thing to mention is that many of the low light situations look horrible and add to the confusion.I relate watching this movie to having someone read me a story while someone else continually slaps me in the face. I wouldn't be able to focus on the story (the plot of Pi) because I was being continuously slapped in the face (the film's presentation). I get that this film is not for everyone and it's clearly not for me. Many out there enjoy this film and that's great. I did not.

"Boring, painful, claustrophobic","This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I went to see it with another movie fan at the theatre in 1998 and we almost left about 3/4 of the way through. We later regretted not leaving and joked about how bad the movie was for years! It became our benchmark for movies --you know, ""How bad is it? Is it as bad as ""Pi""?""Pi"" is about a young man slowly going insane, mostly alone in his apartment. He hallucinates a lot. There is lots of hallucinatory self- inflicted gore and violence. He's very paranoid, claustrophobic, fearful, but brilliant. You watch the paint dry on his apartment walls, watch his face while he does nothing, and even watch as he picks his nose. There was some meaningless dialog between shallow, not-likable characters.I agree with the other reviewer here who said it should have been called ""Pain"".Amazingly, 11 years later, I have just seen Black Swan because the critics are AGAIN calling this writer/director's work brilliant --and they even mention his earlier work ""Pi"". (I actually laughed out loud when I read it.) As much as I adore Natalie Portman and Vincent Cassel, I was determined not to go spend money to see Black Swan at the theatre, remembering ""Pi"" as I do. But the stupid Academy Award has nominated Black Swan for awards in several categories, so I felt compelled to go see it. I always see all or almost all of the nominated films every year before the Oscars, so I decided to give it a chance and hoped it would be good.Guess what? It's about a young woman who is slowly going insane. She's hallucinating, dreaming up a lot of self-inflicted gore and violence. She's very paranoid, anxiety-ridden, fearful, but she's brilliant....Of course, Natalie Portman IS actually brilliant.

That's the extent of my excitement with this movie...the premise.About 30 to 40 minutes in, I was clock watching. Had I not been told to watch it, I would have long dumped out of this movie. The main character Max is a perpetually disturbed drug popping mess of a person that repeats his meaningless voiceover pointlessly. He started out a mess, he ended a mess. I missed the character progression in every way. I didn't know what his motivation for his actions were, and the ending didn't help either. There was so much useless space in this movie that I wasn't sure if the filmmaker was desperately trying to be deep, or just plain weird on purpose. Squashing ants, poking brains with pens on stairways, and more bloody noses than Gerry Cooney ever had.I think this film was just plain too overambitious. First of all, I would have liked an ending. To me, that ending was like spiking the ball while I'm down. Secondly, there was just too much that wasn't explained. Here I believe the writer went overboard on that screenwriting rule of ""get in your scene late and get out early."" As a moviegoer, I like to fill in small gaps and guess a characters motivation, but these gaps were too big. When that movie was over, I felt I didn't know one character intimately. Not one. I have so many questions about this hum drum movie that I could pick the filmmakers brain for hours having him explain what he was shooting for, because it certainly wasn't apparent in the film. But that would mean I am interested in revisiting it, and I really don't wish to do that. I always question myself when I'm opposed to so many others this much, but I honestly could not defend that movie in any aspect if I were to say I liked it...or even thought it made sense for that matter.  This one is a true stinker folks. A good idea alone cannot make a good movie, and Pi states that in 85 minutes.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Soporific Drivel,"Well, the rating here is kind of incomprehensible. Vague, silly nonsense adorns every wall of this cardboard flat while that silly cartoon characters act out their preposterous parts. The Kabbalistic, stock-market predicting genius is eventually driven to self-mutilation and ignorant bliss. Could there be a more cliche take on the 'subject' (hint: there is no subject)? Even the tangential conceits, like the attractive woman pursuing the genius (of course as a minion of selfish, faceless forces), makes this into a prepubescent ring fantasy about self- hero worship (for no good reason).If this comes on, the battery in your remote is dead and both your legs are out of commission, crawl over to the set to turn it off.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disappointed,"I've been looking forward to seeing this movie for a couple of years now since I first heard about it and that it was getting some good reviews. It took that long because my friends had little interest in seeing it and I wanted to be in the right mood to watch it. I was expecting and looking forward to a smart challenging story.Sadly ""Pi"" didn't live up to my expectations. Basically I found the plot silly. Perhaps my background in mathematics and computers kept me from consuming the premise: I saw through it's hokeyness. The movie was also addled by the overt weirdness stereotypical of indie films. I have nothing against weird avant-garde movies or indie films (I love many of them) but sometimes indie films use weirdness for weirdness' sake or to simply add time to a movie whose story is running short.I held out my judgment on Pi until the very end. The ending left me feeling empty and confirmed my fears that the movie had built itself up too much to be able to deliver the goods. There were some scenes I liked such as the ones between Max and Sol. In summery, although I didn't enjoy Pi overall, I don't consider it a waste of time. I was just expecting more.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
crap,"I rented this to see with my parents, after the movie ended, my parents started to look at me in a strange way, :). It sucks, cant be tagged as an ""art-movie"" or something, there is nothing innovator, just annoying, Don't WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME WITH THIS, VERY STRANGE AND NOT WATCHABLE MOVIE. AWFUL. Acting is okay, but rest of the movie is just confusing, confusing plot, confusing and annoying music, confusing camera, everything is confusing, maybe the confusing plot must be idea of the director, but its not good. You cant even like the main character because he is just boring and CONFUSING that you cant just like him, anyway, just my opinion. Don't trust on the IMDb rating votes, its NOT A GOOD MOVIE.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
too much 'insanity',"This film starts of good. Its got a guy trying to find some order in the stock market, or order in chaos/nature. He's a nervous wreck , obviously he's been trying for a long time and he's kind of sick. The problem is its less of a maths movie and more of a 'oh look how tortured he is' kind of movie. I really liked it when he started to talk about numbers and his quest for pi but thats just the occasional diversion from a black and white gross nightmare of a film which reminds me of all the eighties low budget junk cinema that i cant believe anybody liked. The problem with a film like this is that its more concerned about making you feel i'll than it is with its own plot. It doesn't have a plot, or if it does its so small that the director just lumped in a load of crappy disorientating scenes of him (such as poking a brain with a pencil, constant shots of him taking pills , 'strange' people disappearing when they were there only a moment ago..etc etc, its really bad...honestly...) well...that paragraph was a bit muddled but i just finished watching the film so its not my fault. If you want to sea a really good low budget scientist film watch primer. its a lot cooler than this junk.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Strange for Strangeness Sake (4/10),"[I saw this on DVD, YMMV]I had no idea what this movie was about.  I thought it might be about the search for the last digit of pi, or some other similar thing.No.  Instead there is some generic bad-guy corporation want's his number analysis for stock research, some generic numerological cult wants his number analysis for religious research, and a math genious with a homemade computer (that looks straight from the set of Brazil) that just rolls around on the floor in his bathroom in obvious pain.This movie has as little to do with math as Armageddon has to do with the science of asteroids.  It is just an excuse to blow a bunch of black and white film on cream mixing into coffee and smoke floating in the air.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Starts of good, then becomes a mess","Pi started of interestingly enough - the idea of the whole world being representable by numbers, and thus the stock market being predictable, is - while not exactly new - a good enough theory to base a story (or in this case a film) on. The twist later on, when Max learns that the religious Jews are looking for the same number for different reasons still holds some interest. A bit later however, the movie complete falls apart. It seems the director/writer didn't actually plan the whole thing out - so therefore he resorts to disjointed scenes, some meaningless shock effects and a completely implausible climax to end his film. Some may say, there is some deeper meaning behind the incomprehensible second half of this picture - I do not believe that is the case... 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"As a boring movie, Pi takes the cake","For an indie movie Pi has good acting and camerawork. That much I enjoyed. The storyline however is boring beyond belief. It had me on the edge of my seat for a good part of the film not for suspense but for trying not to fall asleep. The black and white cinematography did make for a few scenes with an air of that conspiracy feeling, but an uninteresting plot can only be stretched so far.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dull dour drivel,"Very dark film with a storyline that is confusing and shallow. I was bored after 20 minutes but gave the film the benefit of the doubt and was bored throughout. Maths,Pi,patterns in numbers sounded interesting to someone who studied Maths in College (Me) but it was not. The only saving grace was the beautiful Samia Shoaib also seen in the Sixth Sense.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Oh, my god. What a disappointment!","I really can¬¥t understand how this movie could get so much attention. The story is very interesting, but just for a while. Almost half of the movie is about main characters headache. At the end, i was so bored that i fell asleep. It¬¥s a shame because it could be a really god movie. I saw it after i read comments on it and it all sounded good enough for me. That¬¥s why i just had to write this one.4 out of 10.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not very enjoyable,"I was expecting something different I suppose. The movie was hard to watch from the beginning, but I made myself watch it to see what kind of amazing breakthroughs may happen. It's pretty dull. It turns out nothing really clearly comes about,...they do it in a way that never makes you think 'wow..that's clever....what an amazing idea'.. you never get pleasantly shocked by it. It still had some interesting idea's though.Here is what the movie feels like:Sinus pressure, black and white fuzz on your TV screen, on.off.on.off...buzz...ring...thoughts...thinking...numbers taunting your mind..ahhh..screamFor some reason the movie Cube gets compared to this movie a lot, in which case I'd like to say Cube is 100x better. I would never watch Pi again.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Awful,"A cocktail of disturbing images and sounds. This is meant to be deep and abstract story but it fails in delivering that. The disconnect between events and various scenes don't add up. I tried hard to enjoy this but couldn't. A sat back and chilled but it annoyed me. The sounds and graphics have me a headache,p. The black and white doesn't help either. Wouldn't recommend it for any occasion",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disappointing,"I was hoping for a gripping mystery, a real work of art...and perhaps the filmmakers were, too.  They tried hard, though.  And although the visual technique is sometimes very interesting and the premise has elements of brilliance, the makers could not in the end make it all hang together properly.Don't watch it for anything except its visuals, which do well in emulating the look of early independent films.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
3.whatever,"Hey, I like mathematics as well as the next ... probably even more so. The thought of pi having some spiritual significance is not new - numerologists have been searching for gods in numbers since the first person learned how to add.But this bordered on ridiculous. To be fair, I did find parts of the movie entertaining, but only parts. The tempo varied from too fast to too slow with little consistency of plot, acting, or settings.I decided to be 'generous' and give this a 5/10, mostly because I like pi... not the movie, but the number.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
0.785398163397448 quarter pi is the correct number,"785398 (usually .7854) is what is used by engineers to find such things as the area of a circle; multiply the square of the diameter or the volume of a cylinder. It was found in the original Egyptian calculations the Greeks borrowed. It is also used to convert degrees to radians. O. K. Enough of this.This is a very noisy film. Some of the music you will recognize. At least the background notice does not overwhelm the little dialog there is. The film was shot in black and white, which actually adds another worldly dimension to the story.The movie tells the tale of Maximillian Cohen (Sean Gullette), a person obsessed with math or numbers and attempts to anticipate the stock market. Others encourage him. He has a friend Sol Robeson (Mark Margolis) who tries to discourage him. Eventually, he is used to revealing the name of God. Poor Max, what will become of him?If you are interested in the story that Sol talks about Archimedes and his 'Eureka!"" moment, then you will be interested in a real one in the book and documentary of ""The Narnia Code.""",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Too artsy and obscure.,"Misled by critics reviews.  Supposedly about a math story but really the look at a madman getting madder.Also, no one makes reference to a similar story ""The Hitchikrer's Guide to the Galaxy"" , a BBC comedy/satire series and set of 4 books by Douglas Adams.  ""The answer to Life, the Universe and Everything is: 42."" Decidely unsatisfying.Also, maybe Pi is the name of God. Try pronouncing an infinite random number !.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A well-done, boring film","If you narrow it down, this film is basically an exercise in directorial skills, but nothing more. You respect the director for his effort, yet you feel hollow inside by the time the film ends. Its like looking at an abstract painting - you know it is supposed to be art, but more often than not, it sucks to look at. Pi is an ""art house masterpiece"" so to speak - an art for the sake of art, with no real meaning. If you take away the quick montage, and sharp cinematography, you will have a film about some guy who is trying to crunch out some numbers out of his computer that constantly breaks, while being chased by somebody (actually everybody)... and that's it. If you are one of those people that enjoys discussing how socioeconomics effect the soul of an artist, and various other ""I understand and other people do not"" nonesense, while drinking coffee in starbucks on a friday afternoon, you will probably like this film. But then again, if you are that person, chances are, you already saw this film. If not, I would recommend a find a film that has a story in it, and Pi is not one of those films.",,Anonymous,Horror
Pretending to be deep,"For people who know little about numbers, this might be an interesting sci-fi movie. It is not. Pi tries to make mathematical patterns interesting. Patterns can be interesting, of course, but not mind-bending. This movie panders to pseudo-intellectuals/mathematicians. Watch it a pretend you get some subtle message. By doing so, you become a genius, supposedly. If you like to identify with smarties, you might better watch Good Will Hunting. Pi is a composite of weird sounds, funky camera shots, and B.S. that, to some, might make it appear deep. It is pap.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
as interesting as a palindrome like 20-02 2002 20:02,"Pi is a slightly enigmatic thriller (like Tetsuo and Cube and Eraserhead) and supposedly mathematical interesting, but ultimately not THAT relevant or challenging.  The story and the b/w cinematography gave the film an appealing indie character and is definitely more interesting for people who were disappointed by 'Hackers' or 'Knight Moves', simply because it lives up to its ambition with not much means.  It is not filled with culture as someone stated.  Good movie though and worth to see again sometime.  7/10 (not including positive discrimination of indies :-)",,Anonymous,Horror
Do not waste your time.,"I'm going to write my first review, solely because having read so many good reviews about this film angers me. I urge whoever is reading this to avoid the movie at all costs, unless you really feel like wasting 90 minutes of your life.I went into this film excited, thinking I'd soon be laying my eyes upon a masterpiece which would open my mind to some knowledge and beauty, mystery; and how wrong was I! Like many others have already stated, there is absolutely no plot, so if you're going to watch the movie, do not agitate your mind trying to figure out what's going on, cause you won't get it. This movie was never meant to have an interesting plot, but instead to show us how our protagonist slowly descends into madness while trying to figure out the ""universal code"" which he believes he will find in mathematics. This film could have had a lot of potential to be something big, instead, we get to watch 90 minutes of grainy black-and-white footage with unsuitable audio and poor acting. I don't know, maybe it was I who simply didn't ""get"" this movie, but for me, it was a complete let-down and I was simply counting the minutes until it would end.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
This film is perfect....,"I absolutely loved the music, style, and direction of the film. I understand that it isn't for the everyone. I don't understand, however, that anyone would think to compare this to ""The Matrix"". This film is completely different. Matrix is fantasy, while Pi is based on reality. Pi is very intriguing and philosophical. I have always been intrigued by math and physics, it's amazing how much of our world is mathematically predictable. Unless you can appreciate the chaos in genius and the patterns in nature you will have trouble appreciating this film. Most of what we think is random in the world is actually very predictable, the laws of science apply to more than you can imagine. If you want a break from the Hollywood films I would highly recommend renting this one.",,Anonymous,Horror
"terrible movie, just terrible...","Wow, where to begin. Poor direction, terrible acting, lousy choices in set design... I could go on an on but I wont waste too much time, I wasted enough on this stupid film. While I'm not a mathematician or numerologist I am a smart man who has seen and studied many movies and styles of movies. As far as understanding the movie, there is little to worry about understanding the plot. There is very little information given to outline the plot, and very little plot. It's pretty simple, he is crazy. That doesn't mean he is not also brilliant, but assuredly he is a nut job. This matters little in the end as the story is fleeting and pointless. Now for the acting. The lead actor is one of the worst actors I have ever seen. His portrayal is labored and not believable. I can actually feel as though I can see Aronofsky off to the side saying ""OK now get a bit more frantic, and break that computer there! Now look kinda scared and confused..."" Ben Shenkman is actually redeemable and somewhat interesting, and Mark Margolis is a terrific actor and is the one actor who shines through. This is not nearly enough to make the film even remotely enjoyable. The woman and her goons that accost him randomly throughout the movie are some of the worst over the top actors I have ever seen, as is the little Asian girl. I don't enjoy bad mouthing a child actor (though she is a grown up by now at any rate) she was just so bad it's atrocious. Friends of mine (with whom I usually agree with when it comes to taste in movies) say this is the early version of requiem for a dream, supposedly requiem being the Hollywood ""money"" version. I must say I do not see this at all. Requiem is an amazing film, fantastic direction, acting, script, style etc. It is a strong film that shines a light on drug addiction, the pressure of adult life, actions, reactions and consequences. Pi is nothing like this, not even one tiny bit. It is a horrible mess of video and audio, it really does not deserve to be called a movie as it would signify that it has some kind of story and/or cohesion, which it absolutely lacks in every way. To be clear, I am not a hater of independent films or artistic films. I loathe Michael Bay and his ilk of directors. The fact is that good film making is just that, whether it is a low budget gem or a high budget Hollywood gold mine. I have no problem with black and white films either. That being said, filming low budget b/w film doesn't automatically make it deep and rich in texture. Much as you can't put $200,000,000 into a film and guarantee a blockbuster smash hit that gets great reviews, you can't shoot low budget and expect to make a great film based on almost no story and terrible acting.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
