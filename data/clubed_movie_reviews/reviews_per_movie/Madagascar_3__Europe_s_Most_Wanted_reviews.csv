Best one yet!,"Alex, Marty, Gloria, and Melman and the rest of their gang return in the third installment of the ""Madagascar"" series, and yes they are still trying to get back home to New York City. This film has them traveling with a group of circus animals all throughout Europe on the run from a French animal hunter who has killed every animal and has mounted their head on her wall, except for a lion.This movie stars the voice talents of Ben Stiller (Tower Heist, Tropic Thunder), Chris Rock (Grown ups, The Longest Yard), David Schwimmer (Friends, John Carter), Jada Pinkett Smith (Ali, Collateral), Sasha Baron Cohen (Borat, Bruno), Cedric the Entertainer (Larry Crowne, Ice Age), and Bryan Cranston (Drive, Breaking Bad). Everyone did a great job with their characters and it was a blast to hear all these familiar voices in a film together again.I have been a fan of the previous ""Madagascar"" films, and that still is the case, but I really didn't have any hype for this movie because from the trailers, it didn't really look that good. I am glad to say that it is the complete opposite of that. Surprisingly, I really enjoyed film from start to finish and thought that for certain audiences, the film is perfect. If you are a younger person (12 and under) the movie will entertain and make you laugh the entire time. Now for the other demographic (13 and up), the film is still a really fun experience having jokes that adults would get, as well as some really funny situations.The ""Madagascar"" series has been known to be over the top, but ""Madagascar 3″ takes the cake for being the most over the top one yet. You can not simply go into this movie expecting a toned down film featuring animals that can talk and doing anything that humans can. You have to go into this film with an open mind and just enjoy the ride. I found myself laughing constantly throughout the film and I couldn't help but have a smile on my face the entire time. This movie made me feel like I was a kid again and that is one of the best feelings there is.This is easily the best movie in the series in my opinion. What really blew me away though was something that wasn't crucial to the movie, and that was the 3D. This is probably some of the best 3D I have seen in a film. I was sitting on the edge of my seat waiting to see what was going to pop out next. If you see this film, please do yourself a favor and see the 3D version of it, you will not be disappointed. I highly recommend this film to all ages. Whether you are a kid or an adult, you will find enjoyment in this film.Rating 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The return of the zoo animals.,"Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman are back for the third Madagascar movie. This one is the best Madagascar movie in the franchise. It has good animation. Likeable characters, a strong villain and a good use of slapstick humour.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Nutshell Review: Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted,"There are eager animated film franchises that rehashed the same old themes and gags in all its installments, and deservedly crashed under its own repetitiveness. Think Shrek, which started brightly, but with each sequel the grumpy ogre and his friends started to become cheap parodies of themselves. There are other film franchises that grow from strength to strength though, such as Ice Age where we get to go on an incredibly long journey with its characters trying to survive the inevitable change and extinction, and then there's Madagascar, with Europe's Most Wanted surprisingly having a lot more to offer than what it had suggested.We go back to where we last left off, rejoining Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock), Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) and Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) who are still in Africa, but getting homesick and yearn for their lives back in New York. So they hatch a plan to regroup with the Penguins, who had left with the Monkeys in their flying machine to Monte Carlo and its glitzy casinos, and compel them to take everyone back to New York. Granted it's a slow start, but when it picked up with Frances McDormand voicing the French policewoman Captain Chantel DuBois, more of an animal hunter in disguise and hell bent on adding a lion to her trophy wall, it really went over the top with a multitude of action sequences that get set to show off dedicated and meticulously crafted moments for 3D. It's clearly one of the better 3D efforts in an animated feature film that took pains to ensure the medium got milked for the premium ticket you paid for.Then the narrative goes up a notch with the introduction of some circus animals with whom our protagonists get to mix with in order to momentarily escape the fanatical clutches of DuBois, and in comes the opportunity to expand on its cast, with the likes of Jessica Chastain, Bryan Cranston and Martin Short entering the fray as a cheetah, tiger and sea lion respectively, each with its own distinct quirk, objective and baggage. It's a zoo animal meets circus animal rivalry formed, and Alex and gang wanting to stick around, with thanks to the Penguins, because the circus is en route to Rome and London, where an American circus event promoter would be in town to evaluate if the troupe can make money if brought across the Atlantic, and naturally, New York.I'm rather surprised by the depth of the narrative here, as Eric Damell and Noah Baumbach's screenplay managed to squeeze a lot in under 90 minutes sans end credits roll. Characters don't get thrown in for fun, but have enough screen time to perform without getting the feeling of being redundant to the whole scheme of things, and how they all blend well together for the major set action pieces, complete with comedy ranging from witty repartee to physical slapstick gags. The major new entrants to this installment will also become crowd favourites, such as the girly cheetah Gia, the curt Russian tiger Vitaly who has to reclaim his theatrical mojo, and Stefano the sea lion trying his very best to hold the entire troupe together, while not being very bright himself.Every scene got designed to have the characters endear themselves to the audience, even if they come silent, such as the bicycle riding bear, and a couple of English dogs voiced by the likes of Vinnie Jones, Steve Jones and Nick Fletcher. Paz Vega also lent her voice to a collective group of show-horses, while perennial favourites such as Sacha Baron Cohen's Julien and Cedric the Entertainer's Maurice almost always threaten to run away with the show, given their rather spaced out moments that run outside of the main narrative thread. There are colours galore with gags running wild, and I'd suspect where your sense of humour might have been misplaced if there's absolutely nothing here in the film that can tickle your funny bone.With an assortment of pop songs ranging from 90s hits to those by Katy Perry, the signature theme song only got an airplay during the end credits, and is an amalgamation of the Afro Circus song written by Chris Rock, that somehow had a strange yet infectious blend that epitomizes everything that had transpired in this film, and set itself up for more. Themes of friendship and sticking together through thick and thin, of never giving up and the likes, are good themes to have for a film that's going to appeal to the young for sure.I'd like to think there's a stop at three policy and to leave the franchise as it is now, going off at a high, rather than to continue with a formula that would ultimately show its age. Madagascar 3 worked and delivered everything you'd expect of a crowd pleaser that can appeal to all age groups, and I'm very much compelled to earmark this for a 3D blu-ray title for keeps. Definitely highly recommended in my books, given its rarity of it improving upon the strengths of its predecessors, and finding room to add more characters, not caricatures, to its mythos.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Madagascar,Actually the best of the three. Had more laughs and heart than the other two films combined.,,Anonymous,Animation
A Grand Show,"It's been four years since the last Madagascar film was released. Surprisingly, the elements of the franchise is still there and the film does not feel strangely different like in most sequels. Except, this one has a larger scale and crazier action. Well, Dreamworks Animation has gone to a new level in animation. Bringing a quicker, bigger, and more spectacular visuals to the film and make it a non-stop ride and worth it in 3D. But it's still not as compelling as any other classic animation films. The only purpose of these Madagascar films is to have fun and it truly succeeds in doing that.It has the same old trope of the series. The gang trying to get back to New York then they suddenly bumped into new friends and they end up lingering to their situation and an old lady hates Alex the Lion. The penguins having the best gags and King Julien being crazy. It's delightful and the fans will be pleased for seeing these again. The new characters are as likable as the original characters. While everything is fun, the wonderful visuals adds the film's enjoyment. There are plenty of sequences that are meant to be seen in the big screen, either in 2D or 3D.Some scenes are ridiculously exciting, some are awfully eye-candy. The film itself is like a spectacular show with so many wonderful colors. But it does not go beyond that. The film only wants to be big, fun, and nothing else. Just make sure you are not looking for more than mind-blowing visuals. The jokes are still pretty hilarious. You will still root for these characters. There is no need to tell how was the voice acting because all of them are predictably good.Madagascar 3 is the most gorgeous part of the series but not quite the best. The trilogy will probably remain only as a little cult classic. We loved the humor, the characters, and their crazy antics. The movies have heart but there is a little impact to their drama. It's not something like Pixar. But these Madagascar films have their own personality and we accepted it. Talking animals escaping and creating some disaster. Slow moments with clever and sometimes slapstick gags. If you are a fan of these films then you will see something spectacular to it, but like I said, there is nothing bigger than that.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Madagascar 3 Soars High Above Expectations,"Finally! We have a movie in 2012 that is worth every minute and every penny. If your kids (or you, for that matter) cannot stop singing ""Circus! Afro!"" then go ahead and see Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted in 3D. It is the most clever, fun, and exciting animated film to hit theaters in a long time.When we see our favorite zoo escapees this time, they are on the run with their jungle friends in Europe. Alex (Ben Stiller), Marty (Chris Rock), Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Melman (David Schwimmer) desperately want to get back to Central Park. Standing in their way is Captain Chantel Dubois (Frances McDormand) as the most evil animal control officer in the world. They narrowly escape her clutches by jumping on a train with a traveling circus. Now their only hope for getting to New York is to buy the circus and whip them into good enough shape to earn a touring contract in America.Director and screenwriter Eric Darnell does an excellent job of leading the crew with this third installment. The story incorporates new characters beautifully by adding a love interest for Alex (Gia, voiced by Jessica Chastain), a dopey friend for Marty (Stefano, voiced by Martin Short), and a fallen hero everyone can cheer for (Vitaly, a tiger voiced by Bryan Cranston). King Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen) also finds love in a big bear wearing a tutu named Sonya, and the results are as hilariously sweet as the love saga of Donkey and Dragon. Kids will be able to keep up with all of the new names and nationalities and may even find a new favorite character in the bunch.What makes this movie truly magic is the skillful use of 3D technology. Every leap on the flying trapeze, flight out of a cannon, and grasp at an animal's tail by Captain Dubois jumps out of the screen and excites the senses. It is so refreshing to see a movie in 3D that actually takes full advantage of its capability. The clever script and silly animation also kept me laughing, but I could have done without all of the jabs at people of Russian, French, Canadian, and basically all non-American descent. What was initially funny drifted toward mean, and resulted in one joke that was totally inappropriate. These moments only accounted for about 5 of the nearly 90 minutes of running time, so do not let that deter you from enjoying this chaotic adventure.Madagascar 3 is just like going to the circus, but with more laughter and less wondering about how the animals are treated backstage. If you still like to ""move it, move it,"" then you need to see it see it!Review courtesy of The Rogers Revue",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

My personal favourite of the Madagascar movies...,"Having enjoyed the first two Madagascar movies and Merry Madagascar, and as a fan of the Penguins Christmas Caper and The Penguins of Madagascar, I knew I wanted to see this film, even if it wasn't as good. Watching it online, I was very taken with Madagascar 3. For me, it is the best of the three movies, and as far as the Dreamworks sequels go, it is third behind Kung Fu Panda 2 and Shrek 2. Madagascar 3 is not a movie I deem perfect, there is some suggestive dialogue during King Julien's romance especially(and in other parts of the film) that will fly over children's heads and only adults will get(same goes with the glove slap) and you do have to suspend disbelief a bit in Alex's dream when the penguins use warp drive for their airship(which you can't do in the earth's atmosphere), especially if you are a scientist.On the other hand, it is a fun and hugely enjoyable film. It is the best-looking of the three films, the previous two looked great as well but here the characters move easier, the colours have brightness and warmth and the backgrounds have a great deal of detail. Especially of note is the animation during Katy Perry's Fireworks, splendid in all regards. The soundtrack is also great, varied in that it spans 30 years and full of exuberance. Firework I am not a fan of, but loved the animation and thought it fitted really well within the film. The dialogue is well written and hilarious, with light, subtle spoofing on other films and also on the Hollywood clichés.The story is well paced, exciting and of the three Madagascar it is the most consistent and least predictable. King Julien's romance was on the bizarre side, but also sweet and hilarious. The characters are great fun, of the four main characters Alex is the most dominant and he's fun. Marty, Gloria and Melman don't have as much to do but they aren't completely side-lined. The penguins and King Julien steal every scene they're in. And the new characters are just delightful, especially Vitaly and DuBois. The voice acting is top notch, Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett Smith and David Schwimmer all do very appealing jobs. Sacha Baron Cohen is as witty as ever as King Julien, likewise with the penguins with Tom McGrath standing out as Skipper. The dogs are fun too. Bryan Cranston is subtly menacing, Jessica Chastain is charming and Martin Short is funny, but the jewel(and possibly the best single voice-over of the three movies) is Frances McDormand, whose DuBois is note-perfect.In conclusion, a very good sequel and movie and my vote for the best of the Madagascar movies. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful Animation Lazy Story,"Don't get me wrong...took 2 ten year olds and a 2 year old and they had a great time. They talked about the movie for ten minutes after and haven't brought it up since. This is a kids movie and it's pretty basic. As an adult you should enjoy some of the visual dazzle of the movie but the jokes are for the age group intended. The story telling is as lazy as you'd expect and the message repetitive as usual. And I challenge you to escape finding Ben Stiller not once again playing Ben Stiller. I've enjoyed many of his movies in the past but his range is Ben Stiller. So, in review, take the kids if you've drank enough coffee (I fell asleep twice), expect nothing new, be impressed with the superb animation, let the kids talk about it for a few minutes after the movie, and watch Ben Stiller play a lion who acts like Ben Stiller.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Out with the old and in with the new,"I watched this at the Cannes Film Festival 2012 after deciding to take a break from all the serious art-house fare on offer. With the exception of Ben Stiller's lead all the original supporting leads take virtually a back seat in this third instalment. But several great new characters are introduced namely Frances McDormand as Captain Chantel DuBois, Bryan Cranston as Vitaly and the fabulous Martin Short as Stefano. All there performances are stand out but wished Shorts Stefano was featured more. Cranston as Vitaly was beautifully menacing but it is the wacky deadly policewoman in charge of hunting down and capturing the animals as they make their way across Europe which is the centre of the narrative drive. Since the police team where obviously the bad guys (DuBois only wants to capture Mike (Ben Stiller) so she can add his head to her mounted collection of stuffed animals on her office wall) it was ironic that I watched this in France since the police were portrayed as bunch gung-ho obsessive freaks (DuBois crawls around on all fours to sniff down her prey like a dog come insect). The film was screened in 3D, initially I was apprehensive since I don't really enjoy 3D movies but this was a pleasant surprise. After a few minutes I had completely forgotten that I was wearing the 3D glasses and actually...in the spectacular climatic scene I was completely wowed. An explosion of vivid movement and colour formed an intricate moving tapestry of light and colour that was gorgeous to watch. The kids will love it and any one young at heart enough to let themselves loose themselves in escapist fun for a couple of hours. One of the best ""family"" animation films that I've seen in years and highly recommended. Oh I nearly forgot....Baron Cohen's (as The King) love affair with a giant mute bear is both surreal and priceless!",,Anonymous,Animation
Way Over the Top,"My 5-year old enjoyed it. I thought it was a bit much: high speed car chases, characters falling from helicopters, etc. There were about 100 times that each of the characters would've died in real life. Oh well...Towards the end, all the glitz overloaded my senses. Hardly paid attention to the ultimate scenes. Somewhere in there is a decent story about coming home, but it was lost among the flash, IMO.The voice actors do a very good job. Schwimmer is a natural for the put-upon hypochondriac giraffe. Frances McDormand also nails the role of the French wildlife officer obsessed with bagging a lion. She's a mix between The Thing and Terminator. Even that wears a bit thin, though.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Actually it is the funny one, but also nonsense","I rated this film 7 out of 10 because I privately laugh for almost that 93 minutes of the movie. It is a good movie for family too. Any family member can enjoy it well. And especially for children, I think they also can laugh even in my opinion there isn't any moral value of the movie. I just laugh and laugh without anything change in my heart. The characters is funny because I've seen them before in ""Madagascar"" and ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"". Otherwise, if I don't watch their movie before, I think that the character of this film is very bad yet easy to predict.I don't say this film horrible, I just said it is real nonsense. I mean, it can be filled by some moral values so that children also get more valuable message than just a laugh.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
This one is really strictly for the kids.,"The first ""Madagascar"" was unexpectedly funny and entertaining. Those four lead characters Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman were delightful and pretty likable. However, the second one already gave me the feeling that the franchise was getting tired. Now that the Penguins already have their own TV show, I don't really want to see them on screen anymore! However, how could I say no to the kids who wanted to see this third installment? I just had to grin and shell out for the tickets.Missing their zoo in New York after a long stay in Africa (from the second film), our four friends now make their way to Europe in order to find a way to go back to their old home. While being pursued by the French Animal Control officers, led by the superhuman-ly relentless Captain Chantel Dubois (who wants Alex the Lion's head on her wall), the four join a circus animal train to escape. How opportune that this particular train was en route to New York too. So now, Alex and friends have to help their new friends get their circus act together in order to be finally NYC-bound.I felt that this whole flimsy story was just there to in order set up the stage for one spectacular scene: a very colorful and beautifully- animated ""Fantasia""-inspired sequence of multi-animal circus acrobatics accompanied by Katy Perry's hit song ""Firework."" The relationship of the four friends, which was the center of the first two episodes, were hardly tackled at all. This time it was just all about the action of eluding the animal catchers and getting to New York. The voice work was flawless as usual. Having Frances McDormand there as the vicious Capt. Dubois and Jessica Chastain as the cute jaguar-trapeze artist Gia were nice to know as the final credits were running.Overall, I did not enjoy this one too much. I did not really have any LOL-moments while watching this particular installment. There were in fact a lot of cringe-worthy moments led by that very lame sequence where Marty was painted white with big polka dots and wearing a huge multi- colored Afro wig. As for the new characters, the ability of Vitaly the Tiger to go through small hoops was too impossible, the face of Stefano the Seal is too annoying to be cute, and the bear ""girlfriend"" of King Julien the Lemur felt unnecessary. This one is really strictly for the kids.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hilariously brilliant!!,"Whoever said watching a movie in 3D is the same as watching it in 2D, got it all wrong. Madagascar 3 has amazing 3D effects which will really make you experience the movie in a different way. From the beginning till the end, you will get into fits of laughter and the animals will keep you entertained. The overall plot of the movie is good but what really steals the show are the new Italian circus animals and their Italian accent. I always felt that the real hero's of this smart Penguins and Marti, the Lion, is only a pseudo hero.What I didn't like about this movie was the unrealistic villain and her super human abilities, although funny, but at some point you will feel it was too much. But I can bet you won't notice the small things with the crazy animals making you LOL through out.My suggestion: Don't miss this one, and watch it in 3D.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Guaranteed to laugh,"Madagascar 3 EMW brings us back to the happy fun group of Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman, along with King Julien, Maurice, Mort, and the penguins.Seeking the penguins in Monte Carlo, the group made chaos in a hotel and thus we're introduced to the antagonist Captain Chantel DuBois, the leader of the French Animal Control. Upon escaping from DuBois and her men, the group meets new (animal) friends in a circus train, en route to Rome and London. Can they get back to New York?I watched this without remembering what happened in Parts 1 and 2. But that doesn't mean that one won't be able to understand this film without watching its predecessors. The laughter goes on from the beginning to the end of the film. That's a guarantee! It has quite a number of excellent songs, namely: Katy Perry's Firework (circus in London) and Edith Piaf's Non, je ne regrette rien (DuBois in Italian custody). Both fits the scenes really well. The latter reminds me vividly of that one scene in Babe 2.Like Shrek, this film is not only for kids, but adults too would enjoy it. So, go watch it! =D",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Fun ride,"I have to admit, that I didn't think this was going to entertain me as much as it did. There is the thin plot that made some people say that it gets the wrong message across.

So I was hesitant when I went to see this one. But the jokes do work most of the time (even though there are some weird music choices in the movie). The 3-D effects are also really adding additional value to the movie.

Dumb isn't funny if you're older than 5,"I only have vague memories of watching the first Madagascar movie with some friends and their kids. At the time I thought it was kind of cute, but mostly forgettable. I certainly didn't think it was going to spawn an entire franchise of films and TV shows, but to my surprise it did. One of the sequels was Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted. And, for the record, I did indeed watch this without seeing the 2nd movie in the franchise. I don't think much context was needed because this movie is its own insane thing. My distant memories of the first Madagascar film told me that it was all about them wanting to escape captivity to live in the wild. As a result, I found it quite odd that the entire plotline of Madagascar 3 was structured around the heroes wanting to return to their cages. I guess they felt they had a level of fame in the zoo, and they wanted to be loved and adored by humans again. In order to earn their way back to the US they decide to join the circus. There they meet some new friends that love them and accept them as part of the act. From that point on, I'm sure you can write the rest of the plot for them. It's not an original story, and I found it rather boring.There's been a trend in many animated films lately to include fast-paced insanity instead of story or actual comedy. This annoys me tremendously, and gets me cringing rather than laughing. Madagascar 3 is a poster child for this film-making style. Everything is moving at a mile a minute, and we're asked to laugh just because it's weird. I cannot even recall a single joke that worked in the film, and the story was utter nonsense. As one small example of the stupidity of this movie, somehow the animals all make it from Madagascar to Monte Carlo (I guess by swimming there.) Yet they must go through the entire plot of joining the circus, and working to make it successful enough to tour in New York, in order to make it back home. I understand the real goal of the film-makers was to get the animals in a new and interesting situation, but they couldn't even invent a decent way of getting them there. I was so detached and disinterested throughout this entire film, despite the fact that it has some decent voice talent. Sadly, they were all performing their voices in an exaggerated fashion, so it was rather obnoxious. There were times when I was actively trying to ignore Madagascar 3, so that I wouldn't be annoyed by its frenetic idiocy. Maybe this stuff works for kids, but for me it was tedious, to say the least.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation

This time they join a traveling circus in Europe and have an evil Animal Control Captain hot on their trail. Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer, Jada Pinkett Smith, Sacha Baron Cohen, Cedric the Entertainer, Andy Richter and Tom McGrath all reprise their voice roles and are joined this time by Jessica Chastain, Frances McDormand, Bryan Cranston and Martin Short. The film is just more of the same and I was never a fan of the series to begin with (although I don't think I ever saw the second installment). The jokes are forced and the action is chaotic. Should please kids though.Alex the lion (Stiller), Marty the zebra (Rock), Melman the giraffe (Schwimmer) and Gloria the hippo (Smith) are still trying to make their way home to the New York Central Zoo, which they escaped from in the original film and traveled to Madagascar (with the help of four penguins). In this film they first journey to Monte Carlo, in order to find the penguins once again. There they find trouble once again as well and have Animal Control called on them. The Captain of Animal Control (McDormand) wants nothing more than to kill Alex and relentlessly pursues him and the other animals. They join a traveling circus, as cover, and find a new family of struggling friends there. They're soon, of course, not sure if they even want to go back to the zoo in New York or not.The film was directed by Eric Darnell, Conrad Vernon and Tom McGrath (Darnell and McGrath also co-directed and co-wrote the first two films as well). Noah Baumbach (who directed and wrote such critically acclaimed hits as 'GREENBERG' and 'THE SQUID AND THE WHALE') also co-wrote the screenplay for this. Considering all the talent involved (in acting, writing and directing) I just expect a lot more. I know the movie is made for kids, and on that level it succeeds, but kids' movies don't have to be so dumbed down and pointless. They can actually be smart, clever and have a well thought out message. This movie is just a mess. A mess that kids will enjoy but probably no one else.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6yq7kwUUDQ",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Summer's most wanted animation.,"""Poor animals. Now, you deal with ME!"" Capitaine Chantel DuBois (voice of Frances McDormand)Although I miss Fantastic Mr. Fox as much as any contemporary animal fable, Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted is a lees cerebral but more athletic entry into my canon of animations that satisfy both children and adults. Our heroes, led by the charismatic lion Alex (Ben Stiller), are determined to go back to New York by way of a traveling European circus.If you judge by the quote at the beginning of this essay, you'll note that even the villain, Ciaptaine DuBois, is fun, albeit French, a culture open for satire along with Italy and other vulnerable targets. In fact, DuBois' pursuit of the animals over Europe is a delightful mash-up of goofiness and wit. When she sings Edith Piaf's ""Non, je ne regrette rien,"" I confirmed my nostalgic commitment to this animation and acknowledged the brilliance that would integrate that legendary lament.Although this animation is written by Fantastic Mr. Fox's Noah Baumbach, much more slapstick and far faster segments occur than in Fox, making it a lesser production but far more attractive to younger audiences. Even the 3-D shamelessly throws debris at the screen. Attractive to all audiences is a major theme of looking ahead to expanding one's talents and seeing home as another springboard for growth rather than a sedate refuge.",,Anonymous,Animation
3s a crowd??,"Don't get me wrong, this movie was good. It still made me laugh a lot! The only thing was it did not beat out the first two Madagascars, but it still had a great storyline and a great bad guy which are the things I like!! The cute and cuddly penguins are also back and kicking butt. If it wasn't for them,Alex and friends would be dead. So enough talking,let me tell you about the film (and no, there is no spoiler!) After Alex try to leave Africa and fails, the team goes to Monte Carlo to find the penguins. Then they join the circus and thats all I am going to tell you. You can find out what happens when you go see it. Just because I gave this movie a seven because some parts where slow does not mean you can not go and see it!!! Hey we are all different. Who knows ,you all may love it. There is only one way to find out. Go and see it then write a review. I mean this movie was not a bad movie like ""Surfs Up""- now that was an epic failure!

The Vidiot Reviews...,"Madagascar 3: Europe's Most WantedThe thing about Europe's Most Wanted is most often the wanted is a Canadian fleeing dismemberment charges back home.However, in the case of this animated movie, the hunted are all Americans.Alex the lion (Ben Stiller), Marty the zebra (Chris Rock), Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer) flee Madagascar for their home in NYC.Stopping in Monte Carlo to pick up their penguin pals' plane, the zoo crew attracts an Animal Control officer (Frances McDormand) determined to mount Alex's pride.But when their plane doesn't pan out, Alex and the gang must join a traveling circus disguised as Big Top performers.While the cast has grown long in the fang, the injection of new characters, garish colours and foreign venues has revitalizes this waning series.Incidentally, between a zoo and a circus, these exotic creatures would suffer less abuse hiding in an abattoir.

Big Top fun!...,"I seldom laugh out loud whilst watching a film, but this one easily passed the '6 laugh test'. There are some delightfully funny sight gags and some really subtle dialogue that, I'm guessing, was deliberately put in for the adults. All of the performances were great, as far as voice- only performances can be. The stand-out for me was Francis McDormand; she really got into the part! It's a film that was never going to win any awards, but, you know, it did exactly what it was meant to do, and that's entertain. Aside from a couple of annoying musical numbers (which are probably featured in the trailer) I found it quite a surprising delight. Definitely recommended for both young and old alike.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.9/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A circus adventure,"""Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted,"" directed by Eric Darnell, Tom McGrath, and Conrad Vernon, follows Alex, Marty, Gloria, and Melman as they continue their journey to return to New York. This time, they find themselves in Europe, where they join a traveling circus to evade the relentless animal control officer, Captain Chantel DuBois.The film's animation is vibrant and energetic, capturing the circus's colorful and lively atmosphere. The voice cast, including Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett Smith, and David Schwimmer, delivers engaging performances, while new characters like Stefano the sea lion, Vitaly the tiger, and Gia the jaguar add fresh dynamics to the group.The humor is zany and appeals to a wide audience, though it sometimes relies heavily on slapstick and frenetic action sequences. The plot is straightforward but entertaining, with themes of friendship, bravery, and self-discovery woven throughout.Overall, ""Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted"" is a fun, visually appealing film that keeps viewers entertained with its lively characters and circus antics, even if it lacks the originality and depth of the first installment.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
These pillows are filled with baby birds!,"Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman are still trying to go back to New York city and will do anything to achieve the goal.The first 2 Madagascar films were very successful with the audience, and everyone demanded Dreamworks to make a conclusion to the story. This is where Europe's most wanted comes in. Like I said earlier, the main characters escape Africa and go to Monte Carlo to find the penguins. But the hunt on our favourite king of New York is on thanks to a new villain Chantel Dubois. And now the animals have to find a way to escape, even if it means to pretend to be the circus animals. It continues the story well with having the same humour and charm. It still has slap stick moments by the penguins and other funny scenes, that will certainly entertain the kids. On the other hand, adults will enjoy It's creative twists and turns that are surprisingly great. I liked the scene where Chantel Dubois was singing a french song and her voice magically healed her henchmen. Which was weird, but interesting. But it also has other good elements like the interesting backstory of Vitaly. Without spoilers, it explains how the Zaragoza circus changed after an incident that happened to Vitaly. It is a pretty emotional scene that spices the feature up.As for the characters, old and new, turned out to be fleshed out. Alex still struggles with missing his old home and wanting to go back for 8 years. Marty is still the comic relief best friend of Alex, and Gloria and Melman slowly became lovers throughout the plot. The stay the same as they were in the last films. The other characters that returned to this film include King Julien, that fell in love with a circus bear Sonya. Despite the subplot having nothing to do with the main one, it was still enjoyable to watch and probably supplies the best scenes. The penguins were the spies of the film, that tried to help the characters with their goal. They were as great as they were in the last 2 films. Moving to the new characters, Vitaly is the serious leader of the circus crew, Gia is the optimistic young leopard and Stefano is the clumsy seal. Each one has a tragic fate, and after they saved the zoo quartet from the police, both sides learn that you can move on from the past and embrace the future. Lastly, the villain Chantel is a very insane kind of a villain, that wants to complete her animal trophy collection with a lion head, and she was an unstoppable kind of a character. Perhaps, she's way too obsessed with her plan. And also, it feels like she's bullet proof, because she survives any dangerous situation she's in. Plus, her voice and french accent sound great.The animation looks fantastic. Although I must say that the new characters designs look more cartoony than the old ones, especially the humans, which is distracting, but still, they look pretty good to the mix. The new backgrounds look amazing. Especially Monte Carlo and the Firework scenes. Speaking of the latter, it is my favorite scene. It has the best effects and an inspiring song performed by Katy Perry. It feels like your actually watch the show on stage, especially if you wear 3D glasses for best experienceIt still has disadvantages, like it completely forgot Zuba and Florrie from the prequel. I get it's because of Bernie Mac passing away, but they could replace the actor or make him a silent cameo. Either way, Zuba could still appear in the movie. Also, I feel like Alex and Gia had barely any chemistry between each other. And what's weird is that people believe that these 2 are an actual couple and they're dating. But I only saw them as friends, and nothing more than that. And I don't get why people think otherwise. That aspect honestly ruined the film a little bit.I think that Madagascar 3 is a great conclusion to the amazing franchise with a creative plot, great humour, lovable characters, beautiful animation and even astounding soundtrack. If it wasn't for Alex and Gia's chemistry, It would easily be a perfect film in my eyes. Of course it's a must watch for Madagascar fans, both young and old, because it's a wonderful sequel that will please the fans. I even remember seeing this film exactly 10 years ago in a cinema, and I can say with confidence that it's great. Don't miss it!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Just Too Much Craziness,"""Madagascar"" is one of my favorite animation movies and it's sequel was nearly on the same level. You can count both to the best animation adventures you can watch. Sadly, with ""Madagascar 3"" it isn't the same. For me it's a very big disappointment.The reason why I didn't really like ""Madagascar 3"" is that it's just too crazy, it's just too colorful, too much unrealistic moments, too much of everything. The female enemy is nothing but awful as well. The circus scenes are wonderfully edited, but again, just too much. I can go on with this, but I don't really have time for it.So, you can surely watch it once if you've already seen the first two films, but don't expect a masterpiece. The technical aspects are fulfilled flawlessly again, but the story is just dumb - can't say it in another way. Four out of ten points in my opinion.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
An underrated fantastic 3rd chapter,"So everyone tells this is the ""worst of the series"" so I watched this on low expectation but oh my god were the reviews wrong. This is THE best Madagascar film by a long shot. I laughed more in this 1 film than I did with the first 2 COMBINED. The first and second acts are descent but the funny moments make it good. But what makes this scale so much higher than the first 2 for me is the final or 3rd act. The final circus performance is legit very cool with hilarious humor still in tact. I enjoyed it so much that I was straight up clapping how awesome and sick it was. But of course DuBois is just absolutely hilarious and easily the best of the 3. If this had emotions this actually had the chance to be a 10/10. Overall is this the worst? Nah this is by far the best of the series with hilarious humor, really likable new characters especially Stefano, the best villain and this actually fixed some of the problems the first 2 had

"Packed with problems, but whizzes by far too fast to care","A distinct lack of charm and originality have never been criticisms to inspire a studio to scrap a billion dollar franchise in favour of doing something a little more worthwhile, so Alex the lion (Ben Stiller), Marty the zebra (Chris Rock), Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer) and Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) return four years after their detour to Africa for another continent-spanning adventure, this time in Europe. This third entry into the hugely successful franchise packs so much colour, noise and incident into its 90 minute running time that the issues with the first two films - which are still present here - are reduced to a mere afterthought. To my utter surprise, Europe's Most Wanted is actually quite fun.Bored with Africa and longing for their home in New York, the anthropomorphic foursome take sail to Monte Carlo, where the penguins and primates have already made themselves at home. An incident in a casino leads to a vicious, game-hunting animal control worker named Chantal DuBois (Frances McDormand) chasing them across the city. As the authorities close in, the group make a break for it by hopping on a circus train, where they are met with resistance by a bitter, once-famous performer Vitaly the Siberian tiger (Bryan Cranston), but welcomed by the doe-eyed jaguar Gia (Jessica Chastain) and the optimistic sea lion Stefano (Martin Short). With the circus lacking inspiration with a tired act, Alex and co. come up with a plan to reinvigorate the show as they tour Europe, in the hope of making enough money to get them home.Making up for the blocky, uninspired animation of the previous movies, Madagascar 3 is a feast for the eyes, really coming to life during the physics-defying, laser-filled circus shows. The script is slightly more sophisticated, which is possibly due to the involvement of Noah Baumbach, yet the characters still need to compensate for the lack of actual jokes by shouting nonsense or falling over. As for the newcomers, they are infinitely more engaging than the stock long- lost family members from part 2, with Cranston clearly revelling in the chance to do a ridiculous Russian accent, and Chastain purring it up as the love interest. However, the biggest impression is left by a character who doesn't speak at all; a giant female bear (the growls are performed by Frank Welker) who forms a weird romantic relationship with King Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen) in the movie's most endearing transgressive move. The narrative is packed with problems, but the whole thing whizzes by far too fast to care.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Europe's Most Wanted,"This one is excellent. It's regarded as the best of the Trilogy. And I very much agree with this statement. The Villain is the best out of the three movies, it also has shed-loads of humour and spirit. The restaurant scene at the start is rather funny, and the film starts of quick. The Villain is trying to track our Animals down, but luckily they escape via a train line, which leads to some funny scenes. I love that we are then introduced to a circus, the circus which has many animals performing tricks. Which shares the magic of the first 2, in regards to colour, effects and some light-hearted campy fun. What sets Madagascar 2 and 3 apart from the first film is it's ability to handle dark storytelling with a lighter tone, also whilst giving us character development. Which 2 and 3 do that better. But Madagascar 3 is the best of the bunch for me, it's honestly the best paced and the most entertaining, whilst having a fun Villain, and a much better story then the first. Europe's most Wanted gets a 7/10 by me.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Last chapter of a fine trilogy,"This is the third and final (by now) chapter of the Madagascar franchise, and it's good as his predecessors.Here Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman are ''stuck'' in Africa, and then Alex has a nightmare where all his friends are old, but soon he wakes up and remembers that is his birthday, and has the idea to go to Monte Carlo and get the penguins, but they are soon discovered by a French animal catcher named Captain Chantal DuBois that wants to kill Alex for his head on the wall, but when they defeat her, the plane falls on the ground and the quartet joins a travelling circus direct to the Usa.And they soon befriend a Russian tiger named Vitaly, a female Jaguar, a Italian sea lion named Stefano and few other animals. They perform in Rome, Saragoza, and then New York, and the circus animals help the quartet in knocking off forever Captain DuBois, sending her on a ship to Madagascar.The first Madagascar movie was great (and I wrote a long review about it), the second was good and this is also well made.The animation is good as always, the soundtrack nice to hear at (with the catchy song AFRO CIRCUS) and the actors are all good, especially Ben Stiller as Alex, Martin Short as Stefano and Oscar winner Frances McDormand as the villain Chantal DuBois.I recommend this movie to the fans of the trilogy, but (ALERT) you can't see this if you didn't saw the first and the second chapter!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Lost the plot,"Having enjoyed the first two movies, my family settled into this one anticipating enjoyment, certainly reviews here indicate that the movie is worthwhile.The film starts where it left off, but then 5 minutes into it, the movie just lost the plot.

I felt it took advantage of the audience by using previous frivolities and injecting them with steriods to the point of nonsense and not in a good way.It is a terrible film.

Animation and 3D Dazzle but Madagascar 3 Is For the Kids,"For some film trilogies, the third time is rarely the charm. But for viewers beyond 9th Grade {Ages 15 and older}, Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted has little.Picking up where we left off in Escape 2 Africa, Alex the Lion {Ben Stiller}, Marty the Zebra {Chris Rock, acting like an annoying party guest at times}, Gloria the Hippo {Jada Pinkett Smith}, Melman the Giraffe {David Schwimmer} and King Julien, the Lemur {Sacha Baron Cohen} decides to return home this time to the Central Park Zoo. But first, they attempt to pick up their fellow friends, the Penguins and the Monkeys in France's Monte Carlo.The plan soon goes into danger mode when the animals are being chased by Captain Chantel DuBois {Frances Macdormand}. To hide, the animals then runaway with a group of circus animals including Stefano the Italian Sea Lion {Martin Short}, Vitaly the Tiger {Bryan Cranston} and Gia the Jaguar {Jessica Chastain, soon to star in Broadway's The Heiress this fall}. Soon, the zoo folks buy the circus and use it as their journey home from Europe to New York, while avoiding being caught by DuBois.Directors and DreamWorks Animation veterans Eric Darnell, Tom McGrath and Conrad Vernon handles the gimmicks for the 3D version amazingly well and the animation look rich and colorful enough. My favorite moment is this film is when the once- lousy circus gets its magic back in a sparking sequence set to Katy Perry's Firework.But the film's big problem is blamed on Darnell and Noah Baumbach's script. It plays at an elementary school level and doesn't deliver much big laughs as the previous films. For the record, I laughed three or four times during the first 30 minutes and chuckled towards the end.Even the Monte Carlo chase sequence in the film plays like a rehash from three different films.Remember a van flying to land on a building? {See Speed}. Remember a person standing on top of a moving piece of transportation {See Back to the Future: Part II}. Remember a villain holding on a rope to catch the heroes, then falling? {See Chicken Run}.The voice actors including Schwimmer, Cohen, Chaston, Smith and Short are really acting through the motions here. Cranston is miscast here in a role that should have worked better with Nick Nolte. I'm not sure if Stiller is feeling right at home with Alex or taking it forcefully. But Macdormand brings in a just-for-the-paycheck performance as Dubois. I didn't get win over by the captain's Edith Piaf- like song when she rounds up her fellow injured officers. I even didn't understand what she was singing about.Kids will gobble this so-so taste more than parents, whichever version it is {2D or 3D}. Grownups without kids may want to sit towards the nearest exit just in case.But I just don't know how the world is going to react to Madagascar 4 {if it happens}.Rating: **1/2Parent Advice: Rated PG for some mild action and rude humor. Suitable for ages 4 and up. Maybe parents or grownups could drop off their kids at the film and instead see Moonrise Kingdom, Prometheus, Rock of Ages, or That's My Boy for themselves {depending by the movie theater they're visiting}.",,Anonymous,Animation

Huge jumps in the storyline beggar belief and the over indulgent set pieces - however colourful - do nothing to distract us from the fact that this is vacuous nonsense.

It's the most extreme Madagascar movie, as it involves scenes such as a car chase through Monte Carlo with an atomic reactor, a woman that can run through walls (kinda like Juggernaut from the X-Men franchise) and a rope that chains together the characters, while driving through cars, walls and flying in the air. Like, holy crap!Some characters I feel are just there because they were in the previous movies. Like King Julien (the I Like to Move It-guy). He's in the movie throughout most of its entirety, but he never does anything to change the plot, other than having a side-story about his relationship with a bear on a tricycle.Overall, Madagascar 3 is a fun time for the whole family.

Madagascar 3: My Least Wanted,"If I was a toddler, I would have been amazed at the frenzy of colours splashing across the screen. Unfortunately I'm now in my 30's and need more than a bright colour palette to appease the child hiding somewhere within.What I like most about animated films is their ability to usually cater for both adults and children (at times the animated films even feel like an adult movie hidden within a computer generated environment). Madagascar 3 felt more ""just for the easily entertained"". To be blatantly honest, the film is really not that funny despite the amount of talent involved.King Julian is one of my all-time favourite animated characters, but the King Julian I fell in love with in Mad 1 and 2 disappeared in screen time and stripped down to a form of his lesser self in this instalment, being replaced by the less likable Stefano who's not just a blubber of a sealion, but also a blubbering mess.If you prefer a visual overload without any sort of narrative depth or comedy anyone over five can enjoy, then this is the movie for you.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

Pretty weak and anti-French,"The animals we've gotten to know in the previous two movies continue their quest to get home to NY in this third installment of the very profitable movie franchise. This time they buy a circus in order to impress an American promoter enough to book them in NY, thus taking them home for good.First of all, having recently watched Pixar's Brave, I am bound to say that Madagascar 3 feels inferior in almost every aspect. Whereas Pixar usually deliver a touching and well-worked screenplay, the story here is confusing and morally ambiguous. Are circus animals traveling around the world performing tricks really OK? Many feel that it's wrong, but the movie happily ignores this rather complex moral issue.It is also obvious that the screenwriter has not forgotten or forgiven France opposing the American war efforts of the early 2000s, as the story takes a turn to Monte Carlo for no other purpose than to introduce the ridiculous French antagonist, and add to that a Freedom Fries-joke that feels incredibly dated.To sum it all up, this movie has a pretty weak plot and its aim is pretty obvious - to milk more money from the franchise.

Once again, the lion Alex (Ben Stiller), the zebra Marty (Chris Rock), the hippo Gloria (Zada Pinkett Smith), and giraffe Melman (David Schwimmer) lead the gang as they yearn to leave the savanna of Africa to the vibrancy of the city. In this quest, they cross paths with a dysfunctional circus and see this as their chance to carve a path across the pond to America. The third time is the charm as Madagascar 3 has a mix of adventure, love, and fellowship in a cute tale of coming home. Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted is the perfect family movie and seeing it in 3D makes for an out of this world odyssey.By Dr. Wilson Trivino",,Anonymous,Animation
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted got a few laughs from me though I was also pretty underwhelmed,"Just watched this computer-animated movie with my movie theatre-working friend. While both he and I laughed at many parts of it, it was in different places. And since there wasn't a crowded audience in the screening room, whatever laughs I heard from others were mostly scattered too. Still, I appreciated whatever stuff I thought was funny particularly when something that went over many under-12s heads was said or done. And while part of me did enjoy the movie what with many great 3-D images involving chases, I still felt a little underwhelmed as things seemed to be really frantic even when things seemed to slow down. In summation, if you were a fan of the first two, Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted is worth a look. Just make sure not to have too much expectations of endless laughter...",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Its time it wrapped up before it spoils to be the great animation it already is,"Never expected MADAGASCAR to become a trilogy. It's not that the animated picture wasn't great however it didn't seem that Alex, Marty, Melman and Gloria had it in them to go this far. They have and I am certain the fans are glad.Alex (Stiller) as usual will never rest until he goes back to the Central Park zoo. Much like the previous installments once again this is a tale of their journey back home. The awesome foursome has been in Africa for too long and the heats getting to all four of them. Since there is no signs of the penguins returning to take them back to New York they decide to find the penguins themselves. The last known location of the feathered friends is the Monte Carlo Casino and that's where our favorite talking animals are headed. One may think that once they are away from the Savanna of Africa they would be safe. It seems like the grasslands are much safer than Monaco. No animal is safe with Captain Chantel Dubois and her trusty scooter. Alex and his friends need to get out of Europe and head to New York while dodging Captain Chantel and the only way to do so is by buying a circus and making some new friends.Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath team up for the 3rd consecutive installment of the trilogy. The positive aspect of this is that the originality will remain the same and the fans would very much feel like nothing has changed. However where do we draw the line in being true to the beginning whilst still reinventing ourselves? Darnell and McGrath may survive MADAGASCAR 3: EUROPE'S MOST WANTED but if they ever decide to return things need to re-evaluated by DreamWorks Animation since things are starting to get pretty stale with all the characters. Marty (Chris Rock), Melman (Schwimmer) and Julien (Cohen) have been the funny guys all journey through since 2005. The penguins have been the tactical team and Gloria (Smith) has always been the mother figure and the occasional romantic.MADAGASCAR 3: EUROPES MOST WANTED is funny as it has always been thanks to the introduction to a few new characters as well and it keeps the trilogy still alive. This is the one department that the folks at DreamWorks do things right. The ability to get the same stellar cast onboard every single time has made the animation stay afloat. One does need to emphasize on the talents of Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer, Sasha Baron Cohen and Cedric the Entertainer. These boys rock the boat so hard it's hard not to be impressed and to love the characters for it. One may say that King Juliens jokes are getting old, but one cannot stop them from laughing out loud at Cohens voicing.Lastly as it has always been and it always will be in the future as well DreamWorks Animation clearly has outdone them and raised the bar in the creative wings. This motion picture is by far the most vibrant one in the trilogy and also has been released in 3D. I am no fan of the technology but still if I am ever given a choice to sit in for a 3D movie I will go for an animation rather than a motion picture.Not a bad way to spend an evening and if you want to watch make sure you try your best to watch in HD or Blu Ray, the animations are to die for.TITLE: MADAGASCAR 3: EUROPES MOST WANTED DIRECTED BY: Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath STARRING: BEN STILLER, CHRIS ROCK, David SCHWIMMER, JADA PINKETT SMITH, SACHA BARON COHEN and CEDRIC THE ENTERTAINER RATED: PG13 RATING: 06/10 RUNTIME: 93 MINUTES",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Surprisingly good and fun.,"Having not been the biggest Madagascar movies fan, this third movie came as a bit as a surprise to me. It was much better and more fun than basically the two previous installments combined.Thing I mostly disliked about the previous two movies, was that they felt rushed and had two much jumping around and bright colors in it. It didn't seemed all that worried about telling a fun story or having impressive looking animations in them. They thought that simple, childish actions and comedy would be enough to draw in a big crowd. And I guess they were right about it but it didn't exactly made them good movies to watch, at least not to me.This third movie feels far more well thought out. Everything was written far better and all of the comedy was being much more clever and got executed better in the movie. I can even actually actually say that most of the comedy and gags really hits and the movie had me smiling and laughing, basically the whole time.It also definitely makes all of the characters work out as much better ones. In the previous movies they all had something annoying to them as well but that's all truly gone in this film! They are all simply amusing and the movie introduces a whole bunch of new fun characters as well this time. This also has as a result that there is no time and room for any distracting side-plots, featuring either Marty (Chris Rock), Melman (David Schwimmer) or Gloria Jada Pinkett Smith. It makes the movie feel more balanced and focused, since there aren't really too many distractions from its main story this time around.But even though that the story story is far better written, I really can't say that the movie is being anything too brilliant with its actual story. It's all being some incredibly formulaic stuff but at least they knew how to make things fun and the story really doesn't feel that important for the movie at all. The story leaves plenty of room and opportunities for fun and gags, involving all of the characters, new and old ones.Also the animations seemed to be more smooth, as if they decided to spend some more money and/or to put some more time into the making of this movie this time. Some great choices, that helped me to finally truly love a Madagascar movie and made me interested in actually seeing more Madagascar movies now. I most definitely would rather want to see another Madagascar movie than a new Shrek, that's for sure!A really fun movie to watch, I'm surprised to say.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Third time isn't the charm here...,"Remember poor old Quasimodo trudging around Notre Dame. lamenting about ""THE BELLS, THE BELLS!""|? I was like that during the majority of this film, hands on my ears chanting ""THE NOISE, THE NOISE!!"" Everyone involved in this production needs a serious dose of Ritalin, as nearly every scene is in-your-face screaming and shouting, while extracts from pop songs blare away meaninglessly in the background and chaos reigns on screen, to no great effect. Proof positive that you can have all the pandemonium and hubris you want, but they're no match for good old fashioned storytelling and appealing characters, both of which are in short supply here.I was no great fan of the two prequels to this, but both were better than this. In fact, if you liked them, you'll probably love this... Since it takes all the things I hated in the first couple of entries, and multiplies them. So, you have even more shrill, hyperactive running about trying to pass off as humour, tons more jokes so weak they make Walter The Softy look like He-Man, and plenty more of a stupid plot which I couldn't have given tuppence about. Yes, there is a new vaguely amusing female hunter bad 'guy' whose bizarre antics provoke a few smiles, and the megalomaniac band of penguins are always a delight. But the meagre good points are sucked in like a bottomless quagmire by the litany of flaws, until the whole thing just stinks.PLEASE no fourth one.

Not too bad,"The first movie was a huge surprise to me and I found it hilarious! But after seeing the second movie, I had grown tired of the ""heroes"" of the series. The lion just keeps complaining, nag nag nag.... pffff, the giraffe has nothing special besides being sick all the time, and as for the other two, I have no idea what makes them so special (eat the zebra and get it over with). But there were always funny bits with the penguins and the lemurs. So I was very curious about this third movie. They have introduced some new characters (thank God!), and they have a lot of screen time. Whenever the old cast is on screen, they do what they always do, nag nag, complain, wanna go home, nag nag. And of course you know how this is going to end... So, was it bad... no, not really. There are a lot of funny bits (none like in the first one).

Inoffensive and good,"I'm personally biased towards Madagascar as it was a film I grew up watching. Played some video games, loved the MOVE IT MOVE IT song and the penguins are my FAVOURITE. Especially their tv series imo.Madagascar 3 has a typical movie formula which is fine and expected. The animation though not my favourite, still holds itself up. Interesting circus characters and direction for the gang to head in, nice way to tie up the trilogy. The voice cast still as iconic as they are, still works great after all these yearsIts everything I expected from a Madagascar film, at this point I'm either watching it for comedy or its just great for the family.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Third Times the Charm!,"A kids movie is usually a reviewer's worst nightmare, not for the movie, but instead the audience. The constant chattering from kids, the excessive screaming and crying, and perhaps worst of all sitting behind a couple of adolescent's who think it's the best thing in the world to kick your chair are all annoying distractions. However, I decided to face this annoyance and review the latest kids flick Madagascar 3 on this beautiful Sunday. What were my thoughts on this movie? Read on to find out.With some of the recent disappointments I've seen this summer, I was thinking this sequel was a safe bet after seeing the trailers. For those who haven't seen the trailers, here is a quick summary. The crazy animal quartet of Alex (Ben Stiller), Marty (Chris Rock), Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melman (David Schwimmer) are tired of Africa where they traveled to in the last film. Their destination is none other than the central park zoo, but they must first head to Monte Carlo to pick up the penguins and the chimps that have the only plane. As expected, things don't go as planned and the gang is soon chased by an elite animal hunter named Captain Dubois (Frances McDormand) and her silent posse. In an attempt to elude her, they hitch a ride on a circus train, which is home to an energetic seal named Stefano (Martin Short), an aspiring Jaguar star Gia (Jessica Chastain) and a Tiger with an attitude named Vitaly (Bryan Cranston). What will happen to the gang?No surprise this movie was a safe bet, but at the same time was perhaps one of the most fun animated movies I've ever seen. What started out as a mirror of the trailers for the first ten minutes became a wild ride of fun, humor, and balance that kept me entertained. However, once the chase began the pace picked up and the surprises began to flood in. One major surprise was how well the chase scene was done and the clever use of penguin ingenuity. Although Dubois' moves were a little over eccentric and silly at points, it was still exciting and perhaps the best chase scene since the Italian Job. Another surprise came from the multiple stories embedded in this film. The main story like always is for Alex and the gang to get home, but within the main tale lie stories of passion, dreams, pride, and unity that connect all of the characters together. There are also a couple of love stories in the movie as well, one that is cute, the other more funny/ridiculous than anything else, both entertaining. All of these stories, mixed in with some diverse comedy, were very entertaining and I felt that many audience members will love.The other major strength of this movie is the animation. As I've said before, DreamWorks animation team knows how to make digital art come to life. Throughout the entire movie the movements of the animals were smooth, flowing, and well edited that impressed me once more. Even the lip work of the animals seemed to mimic the human way of speaking that is seldom seen in animation. Yet this movie also had something the other two didn't have, and that was being shot in 3-D. Although I didn't see it in 3-D, there were various shots that one could easily tell were meant to pop out at you, most likely to add another level of entertainment for the kids. While most of the 3-D seemed to involve things flying out at the audience, there were a few scenes and sequences I thought would be fantastic in 3-D adding more depth, color, and pizazz to what was already a good scene. The soundtrack for the film may have also helped with the entertainment values, especially one of the best uses of Katy Perry's Firework song, even though I had heard it three times in the same movie. Another thing I really enjoyed was that this was a fun, feel good movie that manages to give you an energy boost on some level.Despite how much I enjoyed it though, there are a few weak things to mention that may or may not be important to you. Perhaps one of the biggest weak areas is the lack of Mort, Maurice, and the penguin humor. Although they had some show stealing moments, fans of these characters will be a little disappointed to see how little their humor they have. Instead they shifted more of the focus on the new circus animals, in particular Stefano. My next warning is for those who are not a fan of Martin Short comedy as the movie is filled with his constant screaming and anxiety filled dialog that was humorous for me at some points, but at some points annoying. Perhaps a third thing to mention is how much the team focused on kiddy comedy than adult and kid comedy. Unlike Shrek or even the first Madagascar, this film didn't have the well-disguised adult humor and instead was more about juvenile bonking on the heads, and mindless screaming. As I'm sure you can guess though, the movie is very predictable and at points shallow, but that is what most kids' movies are these days.Madagascar 3 is definitely one movie I suggest you head to the theaters to see. Although you can guess what is going to happen, the animation and visual effects of the movie combined with the fun soundtrack are sure to keep you entertained. If you are looking for a film to see with a group of friends, a church group, or even just to take your kid to see this is the movie for you. Although not the most unique, it is still very entertaining and worthy of attention. My scores for this movie are: Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.5 Tune in next week for more reviews.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
They got rid of the animals? Good.,"'Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted (2012)' takes the franchise to a place it really didn't need to go. One of the worst things it does, in terms of being a third entry in a pre-existing series, is totally undercut the events of its predecessor. Here, the focal four are, essentially, grouped into a single character with the same wants and needs that Alex has had since the first movie; they strangely undergo the same arc that Alex himself underwent in the gang's second outing. Why does Marty want to go back to the zoo when he was the one whose desire to leave it kicked off the events of the first film? That's always been Alex's desire, one which he lets go of in the second film after finding his ancestral home and literal family. Even the others in the group surely should have found more value in their natural environment of Africa than in a travelling circus, right? Plus, the characters lack most of the traits they had in prior outings. I mean, Alex should surely regard himself as a performer considering that was pretty much his entire personality in the previous films, yet he initially lies his way into the circus and is worried when asked to perform for it; Marty has no worries about being regarded as unique, his whole deal in the previous film, and (as I mentioned) he actually wants to go back to the very place he desired to escape; Gloria's relationship with Melman is barely mentioned (probably because it's a bit odd), when the realisation that love was always right next to her was her whole deal in film number two (she also never even mentions the breeding program again, which initially kicked off her quest for love); and, heck, Melman isn't even a hypochondriac anymore, a trait that was his defining characteristic prior to this outing. It's really weird, to be honest, and reeks of an out-of-ideas producer going ""fuck it, they're going to join the circus!"" The movie is very strange and inconsistent in its aesthetics and style of humour, too. It leaves you scratching your head on more than one occasion. What's that scene all about where the villain, a literal animal-killing psychopath, sings 'Non, Je ne regrette rien'? Why can that same villain run through walls without even flinching? Why do Mort and Maurice literally disappear during the second act? Why is a conflict established wherein the group can't decide who should be its leader only to be dropped one or two scenes later? Why does King Julien have a romance with a non-speaking, motorbike-riding circus bear? Come to think of it, why do the filmmakers have a bizarre obsession with interspecies relationships? Why does the tiger's act consist of him oiling up and leaping through a flaming cock-ring when almost every scene he's in establishes him as an incredibly proficient knife-thrower? Why is the flaming cock-ring even a thing to begin with? How do the gang get to Monaco from Africa (something that wouldn't be bothersome if the rest of the plot didn't revolve around them trying to cross a similar distance in order to get home)? Where is Skipper's bobble-headed wife nowhere to be seen? Why does Katy Perry's 'Firework' play unironically twice? Why is the circus act so oddly psychedelic and how can the group afford to put it on after the penguins blow all their cash? Why are there still circus animals performing in 2012? Why is this presented as a positive thing instead of an abuse of animal rights? And, for the love of God, why isn't the monkey who can talk the 'head' of the person they're pretending to be by standing on each other's shoulders, a person who's inexplicably fashioned as the King of Versailles*? None of these questions have satisfying answers. Everything just feels so haphazard and rushed. It's redundant, too, as I mentioned; it leaves things in a similar position to the prior film but in a much less natural way. Having said all that, the piece isn't terrible. It has a few highlights, for sure. It's occasionally quite funny (though clearly the least humorous of the three) and it's typically rather visually pleasing. It also moves at a clip, so fast that you don't really have time to care all that much about its plethora of issues. Still, there is a sense that it's sort of subpar overall. It's kind of bad, to be honest, but it leaves you feeling pretty ambivalent. In a strange way, it's just as difficult to dislike as it is to like. Ultimately, it feels like a TV movie with a feature film sheen. It's fine. 5/10*I've just had it pointed out to me that the monkey who can speak can only speak to other animals, just like the other speaking characters. I guess it does make sense for him to be on the bottom, as it enables communication with other characters hidden under the dress.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Great Animation, Poor Story","In Madagascar 3, Alex the lion, Marty the Zebra, Gloria the Hippo, and Melman the Giraffe are back still trying to find their way back to the New York City Zoo. They join a circus that promises of traveling to America. The circus adds Vitaly the tiger, Gia the jaguar, Stefano the sea-lion, and Sonya the performing bear to the cast. The gang helps to reinvent the run down circus along the way. As they travel through Europe, Captain Dubois of animal control is chasing them.The imagery in this movie is spectacular. I really enjoyed the big circus scene. The circus acts are fun and fresh and great to watch. The storyline however, is not as good. I found the plot to be a little jumpy and full of little sideshows that don't relate much to the central goal of the characters trying to get back to America. I find the love affair between King Julian and the bike riding bear to be a little strange and unsettling. Although the Penguins take a backseat in this movie, there are plenty of jokes to go around. A few jokes are truly funny, but for the majority of them I can't say I found them to be funny at all. I was rather disappointed that the main character Alex lies to the other characters, especially Gia, to protect himself and to convince them he is something other then what he really is. It is nice to see that the gang, new and old, stick together and help each other. But overall in the end, Madagascar 3 leaves me feeling let down and confused.",,Anonymous,Animation
An interesting conclusion to an alright trilogy,"Madagascar is one of several Dreamworks franchices that's just alright. The first film was undeniably a hit in 2005. It had pretty solid cast of celebrities, had a good amount of comic relief thanks to Sacha Baron Cohen's talent as well as the penguins shenanigans, and would be lucky enough to have a memorable theme: ""I like to move it"".Madagascar 2 came out not too long after in 2008 and I remember feeling slightly dissapointed by it. It felt like there were too many plot conflicts which made the movie feel like a bit of a downer. On top of that the animation was kind of lagging behind other animated films at the time. So when I heard there would be a third movie, and it's trailers seemed to be focused on Melvin's ""polkadot afro circus"", I did not have high hopes.Madagascar 3 however turns out to be suprisingly decent though. For starters, the pacing is fortunately much faster. Barely any time is spent explaining how the cast gets to Europe, which was a relief because I thought Madagascar 2 spent way too much time introducing the cast to their new enviornment. In this movie, characters move from one place to the next in Europe without much exposition. This movie feels a bit like a parody of heist movies in general, which gave it a pretty fun vibe.Also, the animation is much improved from the previous films. The European locations actually look pretty detailed and the action sequences showcase these settings well. The new animal characters are also a pretty welcome adition too, although they aren't very memorable. I thought the villain in this movie was a bit over-the-top though and too slapstick.Overall this movie was a lot better than I expected. I honestly thought the franchise lost it's relevancy in 2012, but it's box office would say otherwise. This doesn't make the franchise Pixar-tier, but it was definitely a step in the right direction to revitalizing it.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"The worst in the trilogy, but nothenless it live up.","What stands out the most are the penguins, which is undoubtedly their best appearance so far, with millions of situations in which they shine in entertaining and adrenaline-pumping scenes, and honoring the name of the film (Europe Most Wanted), added to the antagonist ""DuBois"" who is easily the best villain of the entire series, far above the fossas, the old woman and Makunga. The movie itself, like the previous ones, has an entertaining, interesting story and as always, full of clever jokes and funny situations. What makes me put it below the previous ones is that there are many more stuffed situations this time, like the romance between King Julien and the bear. I also feel like the first act was ... honestly ... pretty bad actually. Without anything interesting and with a very cheap excuse to start the conflict.It's still a lot of fun to watch, and that really surprises me. It aged well, and I recommend it, especially if you liked the previous ones.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A little edgy for a kid's movie, but pretty good for a threequel.","I was surprised about this one - normally by the time you hit movie number three, the same story has been taken, chewed and spat out in much less appetizing form - but this movie was actually entertaining! Yeah, so the plot is pretty thin - the movie more than makes up for it with engaging visuals, fun characters and Captain DuBois, the franchise's newest villain. This is McDormand at her best. The over-the-top animal catcher has it all - from a tough-as-nails attitude to the ability to sing songs that leave everyone with smudged mascara (you have to see it to believe it). Cranston's Russian tiger is a complex character in a simple film, and Martin Short's sea lion could elicit a chuckle from the crustiest of moviegoers. The main characters don't really do anything we didn't see in the trailers - surprise! Gloria and Melman love the circus! - but Marty's circus Afro song is still a memorable part of the movie. And finally, kids will be rolling on the floor when Kin Julian falls in love with tricycle-riding bear Sonya, but Alex and Gia's romance will charm adults with a simple, heartfelt message - home is where the heart is.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Fine Third Instalment,This is an alright third instalment film for all viewers to watch. There was some room of improvement for the crew to create this film better.

They did not exactly fully committed nor connected to the storyline nor to their respective characters. This third instalment reveals to viewers what teamwork can really do for everyone.

"Surprising how high this is rated. It's watchable, but not as good as the 1st two","It's not bad, but not exactly good either. Doesn't stick to the tone of the first two parts - makes things over the top and inconsistent. So it's off track from 1 and 2, but not in the way that it's exploring new territory... in sharp contrast with the Ice Age series - which built on the stories, remained consistent, and the stories, implausible as it were, broke new grounds in terms of plot...At the same time, it is linked to the earlier stories such that it cannot stand alone. From the get go, the plot and the characters are brought out as if everyone knows and remembers the characters and their adventures... It'd be difficult for a new-comer to grasp the story.The only plus over the preceding movies is that the animation has gotten better. But that was bound to happen anyway. But it's not 'unenjoyable'. It has its moments. Overall, it is watchable. But I preferred the first two.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Animation's Least Wanted Foursome Returns,"Out of morbid curiosity I sat down and watched Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted (2012). I had only seen the first Madagascar (2005) which I didn't like at all. The animation was awkward, the story just wasn't that interesting, the characters were annoying and the primary lessons was ""don't eat your friends."" This time around it seemed the makers wanted their public to gleefully swallow more absurd notions than a vegetarian lion. Hippos and giraffes can apparently fall in love; as can bears and lemurs, lions and cheetahs. Whatever floats your boat I suppose.The plot revolves around the same four animals, Alex the lion (Ben Stiller), Marty the zebra (Chris Rock), Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett-Smith) and Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer). This time the film starts in Africa as they await the arrival of the penguins (animals who also left the zoo from the first movie) to take them back to the zoo.Apparently in the movie I didn't see Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa (2008), the penguins had created a crude aircraft that could fly to Monte Carlo but didn't bring the main characters for some unknown reason. Fearing they were abandoned, the four, along with their lemur compatriots, make their arduous journey to Monte Carlo, which meant they would have had to walk through the thick jungles of central Africa then trek across the world's largest desert, then swim the width of the Mediterranean. But hey why focus on that when with one screen dissolve they're there! Convenient.The foursome manage to sneak into a Monte Carlo casino where the penguins and their monkey friends are winning it big. Things get hairy. The fuzz is called and we are introduced to our main villain Captain DuBois (Frances McDormand) a psychotic, seemingly unstoppable animal control agent. From there the movie just throws everything including the kitchen sink at you in fast procession. A nuclear reactor, a flying machine, an Edith Piaf song that can cure broken bones, a flying circus with a new glut of characters is introduced Jesus movie! Can't you slow down enough to explain anything? Now don't be thinking I have a lack of imagination here because I don't personally believe a hippo can fit through an air-duct. All I'm saying is if you want to violate the laws of physics that much you should keep it consistent. Why don't the animals simply swim to New York? Why don't they use the nuclear reactor they just happen to have to go back in time before they ever left? Why not break into the CERN Hadron collider in Geneva and make their particle mass resemble that of an electron then travel to New York near the speed of light? They're in the neighborhood after all.In conclusion, just don't waste your time with Europe's Most Wanted. If you have kids and care about their future, don't expose them to this dreck. If you do, you might as well get used to raising a child who thinks all complex problems can be solved by acrobatics and a Katy Perry song.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",2.0,Anonymous,Animation

As with the second film, I think all of the characters get a bit more of a chance to shine in their roles throughout this film.I'm not overly keen on the introduction of a human animal catcher as the main enemy, but it doesn't hamper the fun, so I'll let it slide and she was cleverly set up.I think most of my titters can be attributed to King Julian or the Penguins, but Circus-Afro-Circus-Afro always puts a smile on my face!I will have to remember that this is just as important to the trilogy as the other two for next Christmas when I watch them all again.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Bad excuse of a sequel,"Already a very unremarkable franchise, this sequel just buries everything deeper in the mud with its far-fetched, bogus and ridiculous action set pieces and lazy dialog. A truly juvenile and infantile animated film that should be avoided by all adults that are looking for an intelligent animated film like any of the Toy Story films. Poor voice-over work by the all-star cast, and the AFRO CIRCUS song gets old quickly. There are some striking and beautiful animation sequences, but they get lost among all the nonsense. It is sad to see that such an empty story and wrong-headed situations are being turned into feature films like this one. A true misfire.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
See it in 3D for sure!,"I took my 5 year old to see Madagascar 3 and he really enjoyed it. The film is pretty much along the lines of the first two with Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman trying to find a way to get to their true home at the zoo in the Big Apple. The film is a fast paced 90 minutes and the jokes come pretty rapid fire. There's enough laughter for both kids and adults and some cute visual gags.Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted. The best thing that Madagascar achieves is that it out does it's trailer and is most definitely in league with the first two installments of the trilogy. Some are saying this is the best of the three, but Bruno Wang disagrees. I feel pretty strongly that the first Madagascar stands as the best.In Madagascar 3, the gang, Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock), Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) and Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), while still in Africa, decide that they are no longer going to wait for the penguins, who have gone to Monte Carlo with jewels to gamble. The four main characters travel to Monte Carlo and get discovered where they then begin the chase across Europe to try and escape Captain Chantel DuBois (Frances McDormand). In the process of trying to hide out, the main characters join a run down traveling circus where they ultimately help the circus to reinvent itself and earn a ticket back to New York City to put on a performance.The plot is well balanced and the new circus characters, which are the cheetah girl Gia, a Russian tiger named Vitaly and Stefano (Martin Short) as the sea lion add depth to the movie. There are even some developing relationships that come from the new mix of characters leading one to wonder if a Madagascar 4 might be in the works.As in the first 2 films, Sacha Baron Cohen plays the wacky King Julien and his repertoire of comedy stays true to the first films. In Madagascar 3, King Julien falls madly in love with a tricycle riding circus bear and some of the better jokes and sight gags come from this unusual relationship. One interesting item of note is that the circus bear is the only animal that does not actually talk. All of the other circus animals speak but the bear just growls and grunts.All in all this is a solid addition to the trilogy and it will be interesting to see if it is kept that way or if a successful outing will lead to a potential 4th. Most franchises die with a number 4 so we will see.The basic themes of friendship and sticking together through thick and thin and banding together to fight the bad guy and never giving up are all the solid story lines that offer something meaningful to the kids. The rest is just some good humor and cute sight gags and the music is modern (Katy Perry and some 90s pop) as well as the soon to be rehashed ""Afro Circus""...much like ""I Like to Move It"" will be a big hit with kids.I give this movie a Bruno Wang 4 stars out of 5. It is a fun and visually pleasing 90 minute romp. The characters are strong and the new characters add depth to the film. Definitely see the 3D version if you can...it is worth the couple extra bucks.",,Anonymous,Animation

Without going into details, they actually achieve what they set out to do from the very first film, but they have been through so much on their journey that they question whether that's what they really want.

A Circus Extravaganza Brimming with Hilarity and Heart,"The animated movie Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted is full of touching moments and nonstop chuckles.

A traveling circus is introduced, adding a new dimension to the plot and enabling spectacular sights and wild antics.

There's an Italian dorky sea lion (steals the movie), a bitter Russian tiger, quick-tempered puppies on roller skates, pop music, neon colors, the zebra flies through the rainbow, King Julian strolls The Vatican while Andrea Bocelli sounds, there's a bear on a Ducati, the villain is so evil she is like the terminator and sings Edith Piaf (would steal the movie if it weren't for the seal)...You are probably wondering how they managed to pack all this in one movie with a good plot and make it incredibly entertaining.

Madagascar goes out with a bang.,"The Madagascar trilogy has been a weird expirience meaning that the first one wasn't actually that good while both of the two sequels were so much better.The second movie is probably still the best story, but Europe's Most Wanted steals the price as the most wildly energetic and absolutely crazy one of them which I mean in the best way possible. The first one was also kind of crazy, but came off as rather noisy while this is controlled insanity in my eyes.I mean that every new character has certain characteristics like these circus animals of different nationalities and personalities and some are more fleshed out than others, but the tiger has a nice character arc to follow. Oh, and that French police woman is just hysterical! No doubt the funniest part of the movie.And the animation here is just top notch with much vibrancy in the colours and swooping camera movements all over the place in the big circus acts and what else of these crazy chase scenes they embark on.Not as heartfelt as the second movie, and to be honest, I think that the Madagascar adventure could have ended there, but Madagascar: Europe's Most Wanted wrapped it all up nicely and gave us a hell of an entertaining ride.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Embarrassing,"After seeing the first two Madagascar films, I was very excited for the third film. Sadly, it was nowhere close to my expectations. It started off well enough with the animals busting into the casino in Monte Carlo, but it's leaving the casino where the film gets bad. The villain is unbelievable and absolutely stupid. You can't wait for her to defeated, but for the wrong reasons.Then the circus animals they meet are rather boring and the tiger's story is so absolutely ridiculous it's ridiculous for even a cartoon. That really ruined the film for me. Along with the rest of the cast, he was boring and just ridiculous.It did have some good scenes in the film past breaking into the casino at Monte Carlo, though. The King Julien-Sonya romance is one of the funniest and most charming romances you'll ever see. The film is worth sitting through just for those scenes.Overall, this film is strictly for younger children. Seriously, you'd have to have the mentality of a 5 year old boy to really enjoy this film. While the film does have some words that are VERY close to swear words, I can't remember them saying actual swear words and the references to swear words will fly right over the child's head (along with the sexual innuendo). Not a fun or charming film and absolutely ridiculous, so I'll give it a 3 out of 10.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

"OK story, stimulating visuals and music, stereotypes played on","The Madagascar series feels like it is playing itself out, especially with the Penguins TV series being out there.What makes this movie fun is not the core characters. They are full of the expected dialog. While they try to provide humor, it is of the sort you've seen before (unless you are very young). The core characters are really more of the straight man. The fun in this is almost always injected by the penguins and lemurs, who pull in their off the wall, couldn't see that coming, type of actions and remarks.The music and visuals are top notch for animation. The way light is used from light sources was particularly well done for an animation of this style.In Canada, we were confused and a little offended at the penguin remark about our work ethic. In the movie a character states that in France they work 2 weeks of the year and take the rest of the year off, to which another character replies ""somebody else has the Canadian work ethic"".To set the record straight, in Canada, the minimum statutory vacation period is 2 weeks annual vacation. It is among the lowest in the world, similar to Vietnam and Guatemala. In the U.S. there is no legal standard. Many countries have 20 days of annual vacation. I can't provide the link here, but look up statutory employment leave in Wikipedia.Message to the script writer: as an American, do you take pride in the idea that other countries get more vacation time than in the U.S. (and Canada)? I'd rather have the 4 weeks off Australia has, or similar in any European nation. Life isn't work. In addition, work ethic has little to do with vacation time.

Best Comedy show of 2012 and best of the whole Madagascar series,"It's been 7 years since the first Madagascar show and without doubt, the show has constantly improve without fail. One thing which I am truly amaze is that this series could actually keep in touch with it's comedy without losing it especially since most comedy series tends to die down as it continues. A good example to give is ""Shrek"". It started all funny and nice, but as it progresses to ""Shrek 2"", comedy starts to die down and it hit rock bottom with ""Shrek the Third"". No doubt ""Shrek Forever After"" did better than ""Shrek The Third"" but overall, the whole series lose it's roots. Which is why to me, this show deserves this 10 out of 10 rating as not only did it keep to its roots, but it improves it tremendously from the first to the second one. One thing I like most about this show is the balance of both child like comedy with adult humor and also, with some dirty jokes here and there. With all this elements together, it makes the show prefect. And the romance of Gia and Alex or King Julien with the grizzly bear was indeed hilarious and interesting.

It maintained the silliness and jokes from the previous movies that can entertain young audiences and adults. With the addition of a bunch of new characters and a circus themed story Madagascar 3 simply is the best animated film released this year. The CGI effects was amazing and even were sitting in the front of the screen it was still a tremendous fun experience. Arguably the best 3D animated film we watched.For the story it's pretty wacky with the sense of comedy, family entertainment and friendship. It is filled with bright animation and charming situations. The Afro-Circus polka dot thing is still stuck in my head, it was one of the best scenes as the young crowd burst into laughter with it. The penguins are hilarious in their gimmicks and a circus bear riding a Ducati motorbike was cute. The voice cast absolutely done their part maintaining their performances for the characters we love.Overall Madagascar 3 is the best part in this series.

Bad film that will please 6 year's old kids but not adults,"This film is completely different from the first 2 Madagascar, as if it's part of another franchise. As the first 2 films are based on sweet and genuine emotive journeys lived by 4 innocent animals, this third one is totally extravagant, exaggerated, epileptic, full of non-stop surreal action.The 2 first films were of course also surreal, because animals can't think, talk and move like that, but this 3rd film is more a mix between ""Transformers"" and ""the three stooges"" than a ""Madagascar""... Too bad.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Utterly ridiculous. And it works.,"The cinematic franchise known as Madagascar is at its absolute best when the jokes are flying, the action is relentless and exaggerated, and you see more of the supporting characters as opposed to the main four. Everyone in the Milky Way knows that the penguins, Julius, and Mort provide the highest percentage of laughs on screen.So now taking a page from the playbook of Ice Age 3, the third installment stripped away all sanity and logic, removed most of the heart, and increased the speed of the entire production. So what we have here is an extremely fast-paced and random nutty funhouse that is heavy on laughs, heavy in action, and only slows down when the story picks up any sentimentality.Despite the movie moving so rapid that you don't realize there's a plot----don't worry, I will explain it to you. Alex and company are trying to find a way back to the United States before a psychotic animal hunter catches up to them. Along the way they get chased in Monte Carlo, join a circus, and befriend a group of circus animals that has seen better days. The plot is slightly original but still manages to hit all the clichés. But don't worry; it won't bother you too much.Not when Julius has an incredibly bizarre (but downright hilarious) love story.Not when the penguins and the monkeys continue to scheme, beg, borrow, deal, and build their way out of any situation.Not when Mort's big bulgy eyes and random moments continue to thrive on the big screen.And not when you are treated to action scene after action scene that breaks every single law of physics humanely possible.The staff behind Europe's Most Wanted (it's a three-director team, which is why it seems as though this movie wants to head in multiple directions) is fully aware of the power and appeal of the non-main characters---so they gave them more screen time and focused far less on the drama of going home. That being said, it still didn't feel like it's enough. Unlike the support (and their voice actors) the main characters have gone a bit stale; the writing towards them has weakened severely over the years.But as long as those penguins and lemurs continue to exist, Madagascar will remain a delight for kids and a guilty pleasure for adults. And the third time may not be the charm with the original still being the best, and although once again Madagascar mildly flounders in the third act, it's still a ridiculously dizzily entertaining movie that never overstays its welcome—even if the main characters do.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

This movie you must see,"The truth is, this movie is extremely funny, and far better than Madagascar 2. Never a dull moment while watching and every scene make you eager to see what was next. The makers went over board and decided to make the movie unrealistic to the core, Tom and Jerry style.DreamWorks Animation's CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg, confirmed in 2008 that there will be a part three to Alex and his crew's adventure, promising us that we will see them return to New York.The animation is just as good as the other installments and as usual the producers gave King Julien XIII (Sacha Baron Cohen, Borat 2006 and The Dictator 2012) his own story and this time it is a romantic one. But not only Julien had a romantic attachment.The crew is joined by bunch circus animals which they met when trying to escape from Captain Chantel DuBois, the leader of animal control in France.Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman are abandoned by the penguins and the monkeys who were trying to buy their way back to America. Alex and the crew found the penguins in Monte Carlo and started a chaos that led to the introduction of, DuBois. Their journey takes them through Europe where they find the perfect cover: a traveling circus, which they reformed.The most impressive addition and the star of the movie to me was DuBois, she was a cross between Terminator, Rambo and a Blood Hound. You will love the way she smashes through walls, but no matter how bad ass she was, the penguins were better.The lines, the screenplay and the penguins were far too much for my stomach to handle.

The reason I gave it an 8 is there is lots of gun references, look I was a kid once and everything was a gun to me so it really isn't a deal breaker, but I'm sure there are some parents that may be sensitive to it. The only other slightly iffy part was the references between the bear and king Julian, again they went right over my daughters head, but I thought it was a little close for a kids flick.

A reasonable movie with a bad script.,"This is the third ""Madagascar"" film, a sequel to the sequel, continuing the story of the four animals of the New York Zoo that went to Africa in the first two films. In this one, in an unbelievable way, they end up going to Europe where they get into trouble with Monaco's animal control before entering a travelling circus. One of the most interesting things about animated cinema is the great creative freedom it allows. However, there are plausible limits that should not be exceeded, otherwise the film will be totally absurd. ""Madagascar 3"" goes far beyond them. I recognize that it has a lot of funny moments but the script is absolutely predictable, annoying and implausible. The villain never seemed good, being a heap of clichés and francophone prejudices of remarkable bad taste. The four central characters also lose interest, especially Marty (the zebra) and Gloria (the hippo), seconded by the protagonism given to the new participants. On a technical level, it is impeccable: the animations are excellent, the voice actors (still appreciably inherited from the two previous films) do a great job and the film is visually beautiful. It has a positive thing: it goes back to the music and the songs, much despised in the previous film, but they are rather weak, the one that I liked the most was a comic imitation of ""Je ne regrette rien"", Edith Piaf's original.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

Nowhere near as good as the first two,"I loved the first two movies, but this one was just ""Eh."" Part of the problem is that it made the zoo and the circus seem like the places to be, which is kinda naive considering animals get mistreated in the circus and the zoo isn't much better. I liked part 2 because it was animals in the wild in their natural habitat. Now off of my preachy soapbox, I wasn't into any of the zoo characters minus the bear. The relationship between that bear and raccoon was entertaining, especially when she gave him the silent treatment. The lioness and the lion relationship was all right but nothing special. Nothing about this movie popped. The annoying mother behind me who felt the need to narrate the entire movie made me move in about five minutes only to sit by a girl who gasped at every single thing (I'll take the girl over the mother any day though). I didn't really laugh. I listened to silence during some of the jokes with a packed crowd. I still love Chris Rock's zebra character, Marty, but he was much quieter in this film.

""Labour laws are more lenient in France, they only work two weeks a year,"" says a chimpanzee.To hide from DuBois and her minions, the foursome, plus some new additions, blag their way into a circus group filled with has-been animal performers who are also on their way to New York. Not only is it a city named twice, but one where we are honored with two bass-pumping renditions of Katy Perry's 'Firework'.There are plenty of rambunctious characters, hilarious one-liners, love stories and the mandatory moral messages associated with the genre.The number of celebrity voices is well over a dozen including Sacha Baron Cohen, Cedric the Entertainer, Jessica Chastain and Vinnie Jones.Comedian Chris Rock as Marty outshines them all. His 'Afro Circus' remix of Julius Fucik's 'Entrance of the Gladiators' is a definite musical highlight and will play on repeat in your head way after the credits end.This year has seen and will witness plenty of blockbuster prequels and sequels (Men In Black III, Prometheus, Ice Age: Continental Drift, The Dark Knight Rises, to name a few). Madagascar 3 opened last weekend in the US to a tuneful $60.4 million, beating Prometheus, and is likely to do well in the region too as temperatures soar and audiences flock to air-conditioned theaters. You don't need to have seen the film's two predecessors to enjoy this 93-minute installment.All three are directed by Eric Darnell, who also squeezed a television series 'The Penguins of Madagascar' out of the movie.In Madagascar 3, Darnell's proved again that great writing has to accompany awe-inspiring animation to keep audiences locked. Adults will delight in subtle, witty lines more than children – Melman (Schwimmer) declares at one point that he is a doctor, a line we all know pays tribute to Schwimmer's Ross character in the Friends sitcom. Kids, meanwhile, will watch open-mouthed and in fits of laughter as Alex and his dozy pals fly through colorful skies, run from their enemies and perform in at least one spectacular psychedelic circus scene.The finale is a surprise – the perfect ending to a massively fun family film.Find all of our film and festival coverage, as well as our events and education at www.DohaFilmInstitute.com.

Love It,"Seriously the best and funniest Madagascar film so far. Great Timeline with awesome actors like Ben Stiller, Andy Richter And Chris Rock. Compared to other Madagascar films. this was the most beautiful film to watch with Full High Definition On Theaters on 3D or at home with 2D. Movie is never about and hold on to a actors, it's about animation, sound etc. team as well. I'm definitely gonna buy this movie on Blu.Ray. You should too! Can't wait for next film from Universal Studios Film Company. I recommend this film to everybody who whats movie to be full of action and of course, funny. Special Thanks To Actors and the team what made it! Keep up the good work.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Mehhhh....,"Saw it with my 4 year old son. New to the Madagascar movies, but you really didn't have to know the background as 5 minutes in this movie will get you up to speed.Overall, I wasn't to impressed (and neither was my son). It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great. Many adult oriented jokes (not nasty, just way above a kid's head), some that hit it off, and some which were just OK. My son wanted to leave after 45 minutes because he was bored (I convinced him to stay). Some nice morals in the film.However, was it worth a matinée for me and my child ($13)? I think not. I would have rather rented it at Redbox for a dollar. Even Cars 2, which I felt was more adult oriented, kept my son entertained infinitely better.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Trapeze Americano!,"The first Madagascar was great. The second? Pretty bad, in my opinion. The only thing good the second had going on for it was the music. So when I watched Most Wanted, I had very low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised! I think they knew that the second one wasn't good and strove to make the third much better, and they nailed it! I was entertained and laughed a lot. The new characters were awesome, I especially loved Jessica Chastain's character and her accent. It was also very cool to see Martin Short doing something again, I can't remember the last movie I saw with him in it!The movie is funny, the animation is brilliant, there are a lot of colors, and even the villain is hilarious.

Madagascar 3: Animal Rights' Least Wanted,"I don't get why did Alex the African lion, Marty the plains zebra, Melman the giraffe of some subspecies, Gloria the common hippopotamus, Penguins the Adelie penguins, the monkeys (which are NOT monkeys despite their names, but apes and are of the species, common chimpanzees), the lemurs (again, not monkeys, this time, these are prosimian primates), etc decided to stay at the circus? Circuses are far worse for the animals and welfare than zoos and safari parks. Circuses have not even tried to evolve the welfare and continued their barbaric and cruel acts towards the non-human animals just for the sake of quote-on-quote ""for kids"", unlike zoos and safari parks, which have progressed the laws of animal welfare and conditions. Zoos and safari parks are not just for people to look at, but zoos and safari parks exists to protect the threatened and endangered species in case the ones in the wild go extinct, so if it weren't for zoos or safari parks, many iconic animals like elephants, lions, giraffes, lemurs, etc would not be here today. This movie teaches a bad moral about circuses and lie to children into thinking that circuses are better than zoos and safari parks. Where is this world coming to?! At least the first two films showed great plot, character, aftermaths, but this third movie? No. It just spread straight up lies about the circuses when, in reality, circuses are bad for the wild animals and must be banned. If you want to see wild animals, just take a trek into the wilderness, visit a zoo/safari park, or even own a non-dangerous wild animal as a pet (as long as it didn't came from the wild from illegal pet trade, and as long as the wild animal as a pet is properly cared for), but never EVER go to the circuses with elephants and such.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

The use of luminous colours in several scenes have never been used in the previous movies. 'Trippy 'is the way to put it.

There must be a negative character, an insidious anti-hero. His task is to intrigue, that is, plan, implement something, try to outwit, deceive the heroes.

Probably not really Europe's most wanted,"So our heroes have escaped and living free in their native African habitat; however, they long to return to their cramped, damp enclosures in Manhattan's Central Park Zoo where they can stand on concrete and have peanuts hurled at them by children visiting the city. Um...look just go with this premise, alright? OK, the only way to return to New York, despite the fact that the penguins can build their own boats and airplanes, is to save a dying Italian circus. Um...look, again, just go with the premise. For adults, if you can suspend your disbelief and go with the silly plot you get...well, not much in return. Voice work by Stiller, Schwimmer and Rock involves them basically playing themselves with some effort at vocal demonstrability to punch up a thin script. Like ""Tintin"", the strategy employed here is to keep the action moving at a frenetic pace as filler for old-fashioned concepts like dialog and story. Anyway, younger children will be delighted that the animators use all 64 colors in their big Crayola box and by multiple dance sequence. Older children and adults will be distracted by questions as to why Gia, the female leopard character has human boobs much like the eleven-foot cat people in ""Avatar"" and why the Captain Chantal DuBois character is drawn with near obscene pulchritude?

They has made it!!! They were able to make this installment a much better movie with tighter storyline, emotion, and a great new additional cast! I actually watch this in 2d, that was a mistake. The colours mashing with the cinematic action sequence was superb. Simply put, Madagascar 3 had definitely blow the first two out of the water!

What happened to Madagascar?,"As a child my favorite animated movie out was ""Madagascar"" I absolutely loved the humor and the gorgeous animating (which stands to this day) from Dreamworks Animation Studios. Then the sequel which was in my opinion even better, with so much character background and development throughout it was an animated masterpiece. Every character was well played and enjoyable to say the least. I was about 15 years old when I first heard Madagascar 3 was being released and I was excited to revisit my childhoods favorite characters. Man was I wrong! Madagascar 3 just didn't feel the same. It was the same characters as before which I appreciated and the introduction to characters was good too. Animation was gorgeous as always also. The problem that I have with this film is the writers. What were they thinking? The story is so separate and different and unrelated to the previous two films which were great. The story winds the characters to end up travelling with a travelling circus of animals that are touring Europe. From this point on the story goes downhill. It decides to develop the characters from this circus and cover their back stories and why they are what they are like. Which in my opinion takes up to much time throughout the movie and totally spoils it. As for the ""Bad Guy"" or ""enemy"" in this film I would say is what ruined this film. The protagonist is a female Russian police officer who decides to hunt down all of the main characters and kill them. Alright then?..I found her character quite dark, sadistic and very annoying to say the least. Although there are a few factors that in my opinion ruin the "" Madagascar"" franchise the main characters are still lovable and have great character. If you haven't seen this film and have seen the first two then probably don't watch this. Children who aren't bothered by films that have a very different feel to the first two will enjoy this none the less.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Hilarious Movie for All Ages,"Madagascar is one of those movies excellent movies that Hollywood can make because it is truly perfect for all ages. The jokes are there, the visual effects are there, and the timing is almost perfect. Everyone is back in fighting form, the lion, the zebra, the giraffe and the hippo. Of course, let's not forget my personal favorite, the Penguins, who were the best part of the previous two and stole this show as well. When I left the theater there was clapping from young and old alike because it was just a fun ride.I saw this movie in 2D so I can't tell you if the 3D is worth it or not.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Dumbed down,"I liked the first 'Madagascar' film; but the third in the series doesn't match it's predecessor, and for a surprising reason: it doesn't make sense. You might think that this is a strange criticism of a film about a bunch of talking animals, but the skill of the first movie, as with many of the best animations, was in placing comic absurdity within a set of very human parameters. 'Europe's Most Wanted', however, puts the emphasis on high velocity action scenes, and tells a story where the world of its characters is totally unconstrained: anything can happen as long as it makes for a spectacular sequence. As a result, the film seems much closer to movies like 'Ice Age' than to Pixar's frequently outstanding output: one for the kids, but without the depths that have made many recent animated movies (includng its own ancestor) something special. However, the train-spotter in me was pleasantly surprised to see quite how accurately the film portrayed not just the tourist sites of Europe, but even Rome's Termini station.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wildly Entertaining Three-quel!,"To be honest, the third addition to the Madagascar series didn't do me justice after DreamWorks released the trailers. But being a fan of the series on a whole, I decided to check this film out. It turned out there's nothing to worry about because this film was just as entertaining as the first two films and is delightfully funny. There are some wonderful new characters here such as Vitaly and that evil animal control woman. The animation itself is beautiful and more sharper.Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted has Alex and the crew still stuck in Africa. While trying to find the penguins, they crash a party in Monte Carlo attracting the attention of the animal control lady and her posse. Now in order to escape their clutches, they join a circus in hopes for them to get back to America.Our favorite voice cast returns for the sequel and still provide exceptional voicework. We here Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Sacha Baren Cohen. There are some new voices her that do swell such as Frances McDormand and Bryan Cranston.Overall, this is a very good three-quell and it's a worthy addition into the series. Like the previous two, it's a bit silly. But if you like them, you should like this. Kids will definitely be entertained here and so will adults. I know I was entertained because it has an interesting story and lots of laughs. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"This beast has grown real old, real fast.","As someone who really liked the first two Madagascar movies, this one was just flat out stale. While not without merits, the movie suffers from an overabundance of characters, both old and new. Some of these characters are more entertaining than others, but it just makes it hard to stay focused on any one of them. On top of that, the movie is rushed, and the humor is inconsistent. King Julien, a comedic gem in the previous movies, is played up to be such an irritating idiot. Even the penguins have grown old. It's still occasionally entertaining, and it looks great as always, but this beast needs to make way for the next franchise.**1/2/ *****",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Third one is a topper,"Far too many sequels fall short of the original. This is one series where ""III"" outdoes the first two. This one has heart, has a good story, has brilliant animation (about 95% of the final credits to to Indian animators).It has a suitably villainous villain (""Capitane Dubois""), who has one of the best scenes in the movie: she sings the Edith Piaf blockbuster ""Non, je ne regrette rien"". (We saw her the other day in ""Moonlight Kingdom"").The interplay between the Bear and Julien is marvelous. The animation is superb.There's a bit of artistic license in getting the stars from Africa to Monaco, but we can overlook that.There are many outside references (and in-jokes, most of which I probably missed). One is when the circus is rehearsing, and one of them talks about ""this Canadian group"" - that's the Cirque du Soleil.I wasn't expecting much (remembering the first two, and considering what usually happens to sequels), but this is one of the year's best.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Well I couldn't get pass the fail in logic and just get disappointed,"Disappointing? I wouldn't say so but I went in with a bit too high expectation I guess given the fact that I've watched the first 2 installment of the Madagascar 3 and I freaking love Madagascar 2. The show is so short. The story wasn't that fantastic. I get the feeling that Madagascar 3 is just to tie up all the loose end and show everybody a happy ending. And I found of the supposedly ""funny"" parts were dumb. But again I'm looking at this from an adult point of view, which yeah maybe not be that suitable for a 3D cartoon show. However, that's because Madagascar 2 did cater for that without losing its younger audience. I somehow felt that they didn't really put a lot of thought into this and just go all out make something damn epic because it's the finale. I can still forgive the giraffe and hippo dancing on a tight rope but which f-ing tiger can jump through a key hole while holding a zebra? Come on! I know it's cartoon this is ridiculous even for cartoon.But on a positive note, the show is light-hearted and does make you smile and enjoy the fun. If you ignore all the stupidity, and just go in and relax your brain. Madagascar 3 serves you well. So yes despite the fact that I don't rate it so high, it's still not really a waste of money to watch.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Why don't they just swim to New York,"This movie is a caricature of what we enjoyed in the first part of the franchise. The most notable thing is that the plot is extremely fragile - it is holding up only due to crutches and does not follow it's own logic. The most stupid event happens after a few minutes after the beginning, when the viewer is shown that the animals are capable of moving from Africa to Europe, but not able to move from Africa to North America. It doesn't make any sense.Some of the episodes are completely insane and psychodelic, in others the animals give unconvincing talks, which may seem adequate only to someone who is watching the movie without sound. Furthermore, there are too many of additional characters, which are outlined too poorly. The music is dumb and unmemorable - the authors just borrowed a couple of meager pop-songs.In conclusion, the picture as a whole is not cohesive - it is falling apart torn by lack of logic and creativity. The plot doesn't have a main idea, is awful to the point of being hard to guess at every episode is it the ending of the film or the beginning.

The perfect holiday flick.,"Dreamworks' second largest series manages to achieve what its biggest money-maker (hint: big green ogre) couldn't: a threequel that keeps the franchise's standard high.

Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller) and his mates depart Africa for New York, but not before going via Europe with a travelling circus and gaining the attention of the malevolent animal control Captain Chantel DuBois (Frances McDormand). From its wonderful Monte Carlo opening act to its grandstand New York climax, the action sequences are superbly constructed and tremendously exciting; the predictably sharp animation is the icing on the cake.

An animated odyssey,"The films of the Madagascar franchise link together in a way rarely seen in the new age of cinema. Sequels tend to usually take place ""x"" amount of years after their predecessor, but here, it seems that each film picks up not long after the first previous one ends. I recommend to parents that if they find nothing to do on a specific day, then watching all three films of the Madagascar franchise in a row (since they're all relatively simple, fast watches at no more than eighty minutes a film) would be an ideal exercise.Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted is an unlikely sequel because, like its predecessor, Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, the film improves from its original, a rather kinetic and unusually rambunctious animated film. After rewatching both films to prepare myself for this excursion, I was very surprised at my reactions towards both. I haven't seen each film in their entirety since both of their theatrical release weekends, and my views on each film sort of swapped. When I originally watched them, I found the original Madagascar to be a smooth and satisfying picture, while I sort of gave the second film the colder shoulder. My views have directly changed, and I think the opposite of both pictures.The third film provides us with some of the same things we've seen prior to this outing, but also adds some new elements with confidence. Our heroes have been through so much, that if you've seen the first two films, it's hard not to feel some sympathy while watching this one. Alex the lion (voiced by Ben Stiller), Marty the zebra (Chris Rock), Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer) open the film, still stranded in the sunlit fields of Africa awaiting the return of the four penguins and the two monkeys who took off to Monte Carlo in another junkyard plane to visit the luxurious casinos. They make the simple, painless trip to Monte Carlo to try and recover them to make it home to their zoo in New York City.Once there, they make a big spectacle at a casino, similar to how they created ruckus at Grand Central Station in the original film, and the animals, monkeys, penguins, and King Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen) along with his two sidekicks, Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer) and Mort (Andy Richter) immediately capture the attention of the Monaco Animal Control officer Captain Chantel DuBois (Frances McDormand). After breathlessly chasing them through the streets of London, the heroes manage to escape in a car-turned-plane to France, where the four zoo animals manage to hitch a ride with a traveling circus.Bear with me here, as I'm having a truly difficult time summarizing this coherently. The four wind up purchasing the deed to the circus, and then realize that it's a rundown hack of an event, with has-been acts and a stubborn lion named Vitaly (Bryan Cranston), whose act of jumping through rings as small as an engagement band cost him his luscious fur coat and left him with a morose outlook on life. The four learn that if they manage to get an American sponsor to invest in the circus, they could potentially return home to New York City as an act.This then spawns a frenetic and rambunctious journey through all formulas of animated films, from heart, to chaos, to adventure, to sentimentality, to ruckus, etc. While the original film seemed concerned with bringing manic sensibilities to the screen and the second film the sentimental and somewhat saddening side of the screenplay to light, Madagascar 3 seems determined to blend the two personalities. As convoluted and as desperate as it sounds, it actually makes for a very convincing ride.Probably the most entertaining part is during the latter half of the second act when the animals put on a beautifully choreographed sound-and-light show in London to the music of Katy Perry's infectiously over-played anthem ""Firework."" While this perhaps isn't the most coherent animated film in a long time, being very sketchy, jumbled, and very, very springy in its narrative, it has its heart in the right place, and, let's face it, these characters, by the end of this movie, come off as likable scamps. Perhaps it's because I grew up with them, but even to a cynic, they manage to summon a smile to my face. For a series once reliant so heavily on hyperactive instincts and bathroom humor, it has matured and came of age nicely. Hopefully, so have most of the film's original fans.Voiced by: Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett Smith, David Schwimmer, Sacha Baron Cohen, Cedric the Entertainer, Andy Richter, Frances McDormand, Bryan Cranston, Jessica Chastain, and Martin Short.

Fantastic Animation! 3D Exceptional,"What do you get when you take a traveling circus, add in zoo animals, penguins and some lemurs? You get another hit movie from Dreamworks Animation – Madagascar 3 – Europe's Most Wanted. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Julianna No one, age 12, reviews the film below: Video review: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJ6nuOSOsMYThis movie takes off where the last film left us, with Alex (voiced by Ben Stiller), Marty (voiced by Chris Rock), Melman (voiced by David Schwimmer) and Gloria (voiced by Jada Pinkett Smith) trying to get home to the Central Park Zoo. Written by Eric Darnell and Noah Baumbach and directed by Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath, this animated hit, has a great message that it passes along in this film. In my opinion, the message of this film is that the journey is often more fulfilling than getting to your destination, particularly when you are with the ones you love. Or in other words, if you are with the ones you love then it doesn't matter where you are, that place is home. The four main characters start off in Africa trying to figure out how to meet up with the penguins and get back on track in getting back to the Central Park Zoo. They end up finding the penguins, but their journey is just getting started as they head off across Europe trying to not only get home, but to not be captured by the villainous Captain Dubois (voiced by Frances McDormand). They find the perfect cover in avoiding the Captain in joining a traveling circus. The addition of the circus allows for the introduction of many new characters, one of which is my favorite character, Stefano, who is a horn blowing seal. Stefano is very nice, happy character, but admittedly is not very smart. This goofiness only adds to how cute he is. And while Stefano, may not be that smart, it's his brilliant idea that may save the circus and all his new friends who are trying to get back to their beloved zoo. One of my favorite scenes is the Afro Circus scene, where Marty tries to blend in with the circus, donning a rainbow colored wig and polka dots on his body. He performs the ""Afro Circus"" song that I am sure everyone has seen in the trailers. My other favorite scene is when King Julien (voiced by Sasha Baron Cohen) meets his true love, in the form of a giant, tricycle riding bear. The animation is fantastic in this film, and while 3D doesn't always work for me, the 3D was exceptional, particularly in the climactic scenes towards the end of the movie.

After checking out ""Madagascar 3 - The Wanted"", the impression remained that staying at home and watching three episodes followed by the adventures of the tuxedo birds would be better than going to the cinema and accompanying this new cinematic adventure. Four years after Madagascar 2 (2008), the trilogy started in 2005 is completed with Madagascar 3: The Wanted, a film in which, as in the two previous features, the plot serves only as an excuse for a series of gags and jokes with the four main characters - a lion, a zebra, a giraffe and a hippo - and their adorable supporting characters. The three films are absurdly similar, and the only prominent element that changes from one to the other is the setting where the story unfolds: if in the original the quartet fled the New York Zoo and ventured into the most cosmopolitan city in the world, in the second it happened, but instead of the Big Apple we had the heart of Africa. Now it is the turn of the Old Continent, and with that the space has opened up to all possible clichés in relation to Europeans and their customs and traditions.The New York Zoo's four friends, Alex (Ben Stiller's voice in the original), Marty (Chris Rock), Melman (David Schwimmer) and Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith), decide to leave where they are in Africa to go after the penguins and King Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen), who left for Monte Carlo (!) at the end of the previous film and never returned. Alex does not want to grow old in Africa and he misses the cage in which he lived, his ""real"" home, but in order to return, he needs the plane fixed by the smart birds that do not fly.Cut the scene and we see the lion, the zebra, the giraffe and the hippopotamus - with masks and snorkels - on the Mediterranean coast, planning the invasion of the casino where their cronies will certainly be. Don't try to understand how they got there, just accept it (but it didn't hurt to invent something in the script, right?). What follows is a frantic and destructive flight from the principality, following the obsessive Captain of the Animal Police, Chantel DuBois (Frances McDormand), who wants because Alex wants his head hanging on his wall, along with several others dark trophies of this nature. After this first chase, our heroes end up joining a traveling circus on wheels (on a train), under the promise that he would end up performing in New York. The circus life allows several new characters to be introduced, with emphasis on the Siberian tiger Vitaly (Bryan Cranston), the jaguar Gia (Jessica Chastain) and the sea lion Stefano (Martin Short).The new feature, directed by six hands by Eric Darnell, Tom McGrath and Conrad Vernon, not only ignores all the evolution of the protagonists in past chapters, but it does so to tell a dull story that cripples previous plots. The most shocking of all is that the script was written by Darnell, co-creator of ""Madagascar"", and Noah Baumbach, a frequent contributor to Wes Anderson and writer of films such as ""The Life Acquatic with Steve Zizou"", ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" and""The Squid and the Wale "". But, for them, silly jokes, mainly physical ones, will make fun of this trip in Europe, which in certain moments gains psychedelic tones in the main presentation of the circus. Adopting the child's imaginary vision of the thing, the show is colorful, lively and very well directed, making us adults see that whole show in the same way that little ones see it, like a dream.The main quartet enters the scene again basically to make new versions of embarrassing situations previously explored, sending away all the growth they had experienced up to that point. Alex, for example, goes back to trying to find his place in the world and faces a new alpha male with whom he accidentally competes. Marty has another fight with his lion friend, Melman again has to deal with his insecurities with Gloria helping him to overcome his fears. At times, the impression remains that the only thing that changed from the second chapter to this one was the scenery and the poor quality of the jokes. Even the structure of the story is repeated, with very few changes, with the animals arriving, winning new friends, doing nonsense and redeeming themselves later.Nor does the circus present us with very interesting figures. The tiger Vitaly who lost her willpower, the tigress Gia, who apparently needs a man to help her find her way, and a sea lion with a heart bigger than her intelligence. This excess of characters on rare occasions turns into good interactions between them, with the film depending almost exclusively on penguins and lemurs, in completely isolated moments, to make them laugh. The villain DuBois deserves a negative highlight. Boring and having his posture à la T-1000 when chasing Alex incessantly as his only characteristic, the character still manages to insult a French icon by making a terrible and completely unnecessary interpretation of ""Non, Je Regrette Rien"", music by Edith Piaf, for motivate your French companions. We never know why the hell she wants the lion's head so much for her collection or her motivation to hate animals so much that she becomes a psychopath (the only explanation given is that she has only one blank space in her collection of stuffed ones - that one). Destined for the lion! And for that reason she will not give up on pursuing Alex and his companions, even if for that he has to travel all over Europe) .... Anyway, a very weak antagonist.But, despite the writers' effort to innovate, Madagascar 3 looks like reheated coffee with soled cake. The freshness and inventiveness of the series are gone and, in its places, we have more exaggerations and more frenzy. The situations are repeated to exhaustion: there is a spectacular escape followed by some moments of peace, broken by you guessed it, another spectacular escape. Not even the explosive setup of the show in London and the climax already in Central Park presents anything that is more than easily forgettable fun. As if that were not enough, even the priceless penguins and the exaggerated lemur king do not help the plot. With the profusion of new characters and the need to create bombastic moments every five minutes, there is little emphasis on them and, even when they are focused, the jokes are eternal, as is the case of Julien's novel with a huge bear of pink tutu. It's nice the first time, ok the second time, but, for the eighth time, the game is diluted and completely loses the impact and even the reason for being. In fact, this romantic couple is very reminiscent, in its strangeness, of the Donkey with the female dragon in Shrek, that is, it is an idea shamelessly reused by Dreamworks itself.Expanding the look beyond the African savannas, the three directors (supposedly, three thinking heads) show little inspiration to explore European localities, limited to registering tourist spots that, unrelated to the context of the narrative, are expendable. To the directors, just put the animals in the urban jungles to the rhythm of a relatively exciting soundtrack, with songs by Katy Perry and LMFAO, as well as songs by Edith Piaf, the aesthetic inspiration of the villain Chantel DuBois. Finally, what about the nefarious and capitalist use of 3D, which justifies the more expensive ticket just to throw objects at the viewer or to project Melman's neck.On the other hand, finding in the circus the rescue dreamed of by New York animals, the narrative unexpectedly and intelligently closes the trilogy - a term I thought carefully before using it - and the mind-boggling persecution finally culminates in the touching discovery of the animals where they belong from, which involves overcoming complacency and the bars that cage and distort the real desires and aspirations of each one. Here, the script, until then relatively lazy and taking advantage of the constant action to hide its flaws, surprises by presenting a beautiful message about moving forward and leaving the past behind. In this journey of self-knowledge that the characters went through over three films, adopting this universal theme discourse in the end ended up delivering something more in a film that was expected to be just fun and just.However, Madagascar 3 shows that the franchise, which has never been one of the best, has weakened considerably. His characters lost strength and became repetitive. To make matters worse, in this third adventure the script is almost put aside. The action throws everyone from side to side until half of the film and it is only when they arrive at the circus that a thread of history begins, with the entry of new characters. Needing to enforce the 3D effect, the film seems much more focused on flying juggles, which reinforce the three-dimensional effect of ""jumping in the eyes"", than on being funny or amusing.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
if you are an ardent fan of Madagascar series and the third part is like icing on the cake,"Madagascar 3 : Europe's Most Wanted was a fun-filled joy ride that was superb , hilarious , entertaining , exciting which was better than the previous two partsAlex , Marty , Gloria and Melman wanted to go back to New York Zoo where they came from and in between meets a circus group where each character is trying to re-invent themselves and save the circus from shutting down.Now I have been an ardent fan of Madagascar series and the third part is like icing on the cake. Not only the animation works wonder here , but even the characters are so lovable that you would remember them after you have left the theater and this where Madagascar leaves a solid impression. Madagascar 3 has new exuberant characters with each identity of its own adding colours to already famous franchises. Screenplay is good. Dialogues are hilarious. Animation is spell-binding with awesome 3D effects. All the characters have been very written so well right from penguins till king Julian .Ben Stiller , Jade Pinket Smith , David Scwimmer and Chris Rock as are usual superb with their voices. Rest of the star cast have done justice to their role. Few scenes like the chasing scenes or the circus scene where performs well have been shot righteously.A nice family watch and impressive animation and thorough entertainment. This one is sure to be enjoyed with your family. Very Good 4 /5",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Beautiful animation, amazing 3D and full of energy","This is by far my favorite film of the Madagascar series.It is insanely fast and very energetic. Very often movies have a great opening scene and then they settle into a slower pace or opt for a more grounded feel. In this movie every scene is snappy, every character is over the top, everything is always theatrical and it is fun beginning to end.It is clever and it clearly makes a decision not to be heavy, not even for a moment. There is no moralizing and it totally disregards (even animation) ""reality"" for more fun, more stunning animation or more stunning 3D. It has a great tone and the lemur / bear on tricycle love story is just one of many great little extras that make you smile from beginning to end of this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A little confused,I'm so in love with the penguins but where the is Alex's family?!,8.0,Anonymous,Animation
This one is epic and the plot is so smooth. The soundtrack was also great.,"This movie is just another add- on to Dream Works' array of masterpieces. The plot is epic smooth and comedic and the new characters were all awesome and hyperbolic. Voice actors and actresses were also working so great and just perfectly fit their respective roles and the European scene could be felt in anywhere in the scene (except on the latter part). The most loved character perhaps, would be Captain Chantel DuBois, a French police woman possessing that super hyperbolic character. The circus characters were also playful and the entire film would fictionally drive you to European scenes. Also, Fireworks by my Katy is a perfect soundtrack of the film. Some action were mild though and the other ""some"" possesses rude humor but I don't think so this should be rated PG :)",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Running the circuit,"The penguins and monkeys construct a flying machine only to venture out to Europe, where they indulge into a Monaco grifting binge at casinos. Alex (Ben Stiller), Marty (Chris Rock), Melman (David Schwimmer) and Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith) left behind still dream about returning to the Big Apple, hence inexplicably plan to catch up with their friends going ape on European soil. After swimming across the Mediterranean in true cartoonish fashion, the quartet plus King Julien and his entourage, happen upon the ingenious penguin / monkey brigade, but cause havoc in the meantime. This causes sinister French animal catcher Captain Chantel DuBois (Frances McDormand), dreaming of capturing the head of the ultimate prize: a lion, to be called into action. After a courageous escape the expanded group of animals catch a ride with a decrepit circus full of various high-flying, hoop-jumping animals.A much improved outing than the somewhat contrived first sequel, does a pretty decent balancing act on a high sky tightrope, where dramatic elements hold together the whole act comprising of new characters and the exposition of the best from the old animal crew. Naturally penguins, distinguished chimps and ego-maniacal lemurs get they fair share of screen time, but they are enhanced by a selection of great circus mammals, starting from a Russian tiger capable of the impossible (literally) and ending with belligerent little pooches, each with their nice character quirks. Meanwhile the supposed foursome which make up the heroes of the franchise take a back seat in proceedings. Thankfully, as Alex lacks any true impression, while Chris Rock's frantic exuberance as Marty is mostly just achingly irritating. Melman and Gloria as generally likable, but almost invisible with no true impact on the story, apart from them working out a circus act together.Nonetheless this crazy and chaotic sequel is a far cry from its tired predecessor, inflaming life into characters and highlighting its strongest traits with a no-holds-barred approach. All in all the film is a wacky pleasure to behold, despite the apparently flimsy narrative to follow, more working out like random goofs and gags, which fit together to create a grand picture heading to a big final prank. Thankfully the script manages to never overwork the premise or overuse their most intriguing characters. Managing to avoid a simple rehash (as in ""Madagascar 2"") this part invigorated interest in the franchise with a host of new animals sure to endear themselves to the public and probably increasing the shelf life by at least one more movie venture into the universe and more Penguins series to boot. The story itself, despite being somewhat basic and predictable (dealing with recognisable issues of friendship and trust), holds the proceedings together, despite the rampant wildness of infectious humour, which is sure to imbue an honest chuckle more often than not. Definitely a movie which is sure to entertain both young and old, albeit moments of laughter are sure to differ depending on age groups.Surprisingly must say I enjoyed the movie much more than the original and is a rare example of a movie, which manages to focus on what works and remolding what doesn't to deliver an improvement on both the original and its sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
This should be the most wanted Madagascar movie!,"Rarely do sequels top their predecessors. This movie is unbelievably superior to both, part 1 & 2 in so many ways, that I'm even ready to forgive them for diverging from the events of part 2 without much explanation & creating some plot holes. The visuals were outstanding, all the characters were in their best form, the storytelling was moving, and the score & soundtrack by Hans Zimmer added to the stars of the show. I'm thoroughly surprised & satisfied with this ending.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
triumph of visuals,"No doubt that it is best of the madagascar series.. More funnier,more colourful and just above in everything than original movies. Must say,the visual effects are fantastic and magnificent for a animated movie. Shinning and shimmering set of pieces are just too good. voice acting is just over the top,everybody did a great job. the gags,punches,jokes and slapstick really entertains us. The only weakness is its silliness and stupidity of script and how all the animals do the things they just can't do,but its fine because it is a animated movie for kids. but the story could have been better its really simple and predictable. in spite of not-so-good writing it is the most entertaining in the series and dazzling enough to take us on a bumpy ride with full of fun. Just switch off your brain,don't think what's happening and how is it happening and Enjoy the visually impressive and funniest animated flick of the year",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Circus Of Laughter,"Firstly, ""Ta Ta Ta Tadada Circus, Ta TA TA tadada Afro, Circus Afro ,Circus Afro, Polka dot Polka dot AFRO"" That tune just stayed in my head for days even after watching the movie! That should tell you how much fun the movie was... Right from the word Go, The movie starts up with a Festival of laughter, and if you don't manage to laugh at the Humor set up by the writers of the 3rd (and hopefully not the last)installment of this franchise, You really have absolutely no sense of humor. PERIOD! From the Silly Seriousness of the penguins, to the Efforts to lead the troupe by Alex, or Marty, well Just being Marty, this is one Movie that i can keep watching for years to come..",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""So, you run away with the circus. What a cliche.""","Alex, Marty, Melman, and Gloria, accompanied by the Penguins, join a traveling circus, hoping to return home to the New York Zoo. The third part of ""Madagascar"" brings a lot of new characters whose charisma does not lag behind the original four. Feel-good ocean's-eleven-mission-impossible-action romantic comedy with a horror atmosphere in one scene and lots of flashy colors and crazy fun in all the others. Witty, emotional, and extremely entertaining. By far the best in the franchise.9/10Alex: The Colosseum, the original theater in the round, Marty. You know, my ancestors used to perform here.

Excellent animated feature!! The best Madagascar!!,"This is by one word AMAZING! The animation is just flawless, music is once again composed by one and only Hans Zimmer! Usually the third, fourth and the fifth sequels are bad but this one is better than the first two! It has a lot of 3-D effects so its a must watch in 3-D... The story is kinda weird. One moment they are in Africa but the next moment they are in Monte Carlo (they swam there) and they are being hunted by an crazy policewoman who wants to kill them. Jokes are very funny there are many moments where you will laugh out loud so whole cinema can hear you!
