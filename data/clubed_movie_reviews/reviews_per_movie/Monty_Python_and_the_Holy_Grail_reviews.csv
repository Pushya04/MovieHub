"""I am your king."" ""Well, I didn't vote for you.""","Monty Python (or John Cleese, Michael Palin, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam, Graham Chapman and Eric Idle) brought their brilliant wit and smart humour to theatrical audiences back in 1975 with this nice little gem. If you have never seen Monty Python before it will either change your life and how you look at comedy or you will scratch your head and wonder what is so funny.In this farcical story King Arthur (to me a brilliant performance and played extremely straight by Graham Chapman) armed with his Knights of the Round Table is on his search for the Holy Grail.They come face to face with deadly black knights, killer rabbits and lonely lustful nuns to name a few.There really isn't a low point in the film as the laughs keep coming and ridiculous characters keep showing up. My favourite scenes are King Arthur's sword fight with the black knight (John Cleese), meeting the Knights Who Say Ni! lead by Michael Palin and dealing with the bridgekeeper (Terry Gilliam) of the Bridge of Death.While this is a film from Python about one thing that being King Arthur's quest for the Holy Grail it still to me has the soul of sketch comedy due to silly characters that show up for generally one scene and then you move onto the next character. Which to me is completely fine. I think this group may have been the absolute best at sketch comedy.Last night my fiancee, my sister, my niece and I went and saw this at a theatre, but it was very interactive. They gave you two halves of coconuts and lines to shout out to the screen. If you are a fan of Monty Python or this film it is not just highly recommended it is a must for those people.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Monty Python at their best,"In the Realm of King Arthur, the Monty Python team set out on a quest to recruit the best Knights in the kingdom and find the Holy Grail.This is Classic Python Mayhem, where we encounter Killer rabbits, Knights who go Nee! and Horny Nuns who lure the unsuspecting in with there Grail Shaped Beacon.The Cast all give Typically Hilarious Performances, bringing another must see to the Python Loving Audience.If You Like Monty Python, you'll love it, if you don't then stay away.If you've never seen Monty Python before then give it a try, yes it's dated but its still great fun.9/10Also see, The Life Of Brian and The Meaning of Life",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Before Watching: Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975),"""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" (1975) is a genius piece of British comedy. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:This movie is absolute nuts. First some cautions, though - there is some gore and blood (although so over-the-top is comedic), a few scenes which might be classified as religiously offensive, and a longer scene which is highly sexually suggestive. All these things can be uncomfortable for people that are sensitive to the respective categories and should in that case be taken into account.As for the rest of the movie, it is insane. Humor is usually created when there is a plot-twist that deviates from one's expectations, and in that sense, this movie is nothing but humor. Its sole purpose is to make sure the viewer never stands steady and comfortable in what to expect, and that this the only expectation one can have. If quirky yet brilliant and genius humor like this is appreciated, Monty Python and the Holy Grail is an absolute feast, and make sure to watch the Special Editions that features the short ""Dentist On the Job.""My personal grade: a hilarious 8/10.

the ultimate nonsense comedy,"Well, this is unquestionably one of the funniest movies ever made. The first time a saw it I laughed to tears and this is the only time that counts. The first time you get the best experience. I really envy those who haven't seen it yet.From the opening scene to the sudden ending this one won't let you leave the room. Especially the opening scene: ""Are you trying to say that coconuts migrate"" or when John Cleese trying to be Tarzan, hanging on the rope said: ""Can somebody give me a push."" An absolute masterpiece.Considering the low budget that the creators of the movie had at their disposal would probably make ""The Holy Grail"" the best movie in this genre-silly nonsense kind of stuff. It shows the great creativity and acting capabilities of the Monty Python crew. It comes to say that a movie can be made with a little bit of money - a great movie. 10 out of 10",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
WHAT is the capital of Assyria? I don't know that!,"I do know, however, that Monty Python and the Holy Grail is one of the funniest movies ever made. Let's face it, if the Python hadn't showed up in 1969, someone would have created them by now, or the world would be a much sadder place. Alongside Life of Brian, which is the sextet's masterpiece, Holy Grail is an excellent start if you want to get addicted to their surreal humor.As suggested in the title, the film deals with the Arthurian stories, freely reinterpreted by the Python ensemble: after recruiting his knights, including Sir Lancelot (John Cleese), Sir Robin (Eric Idle), Sir Bedevere (Terry Jones) and Sir Galahad (Michael Palin), King Arthur (Graham Chapman) embarks on a mission from God (also Chapman, voice only though): to seek and find the Holy Grail. No need to say, the journey is going to be perilous, but also hilarious, our heroes doing their ""best"" to screw everything up.As in Life of Brian, there are so many good bits choosing just one or two feels reductive and disrespectful, given the material. It's pure comedy gold from start to finish, a non-stop gag marathon: from the mock Scandinavian subtitles in the opening credits to the argument about swallows, from the Killer Rabbit to the Black Knight and the jaw-dropping epilogue, you will keep grinning like never before (if you're unfamiliar with these comedians, that is). Actually, after some serious thinking I can select two particular sequences as particularly memorable: the Knights who say ""Ni!"" and the Bridge of Death. The rest of the film is ace too, but those two scenes are the ones I can't stop thinking of fondly whenever the movie is mentioned.Oh, and let's not forget Terry Gilliam's vital contribution: he doesn't appear that much as an actor (his Bridgekeeper is absolute genius, though), but he compensates that with the remarkable animations used to depict part of this epic adventure. Speaking of epic, this picture has one of the most brilliant tag-lines in comedy history, if not film history in general.Oh yes, the world wouldn't be quite the same without the Monty Python. Even the most miserable person on the planet will laugh like a lunatic after viewing any of their films.P.S. Ni!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
They could grab it by the husk.....,"King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table set out on a quest to find the Holy Grail...as told to do so by a cartoon God that lives in the clouds...Easily the most hilarious and original comedy ever made, Monty Python and the Holy Grail claims it's undisputed throne through insanely ridiculous situations and characters that will very likely never be duplicated. Pure comedic genius that doesn't go stale with age or decades of competition having been released. Simply seeing the way comedy films are made today, this film will very likely have a long reign before anything can even hold a candle to it. An absolute belly-laugh fest that never lets up.Only the cast of Monty Python could have pulled this film off, with each actor playing many different characters...all hilarious! The genius in the actors' lines themselves are truly to be admired. The comedic style of talking in circles is one technique that most comedies do not try to do, simply because they can't compete with the genius of this film, which uses it flawlessly. Those that do try usually fall flat on their faces. Two particularly excellent examples of this can be seen in the beginning scene, in which the characters discuss the origins of coconuts.....and the other when Lancelot breaks into the swamp castle to save the ""damsel in distress."" This is merely one technique that the cast has perfected to conjure up laughs consistently throughout the entire film. The only way that I can imagine that someone might not like this film is if they simply do not enjoy it's type of humor. Too bad for them.Another hilarious technique used in the film is the use of comedy in the background. From people slamming cats against poles for no apparent reason, to people filling up baskets with mud in the fields....all very strange and hilarious at the same time. It's also simply amazing that all of the characters are played by the same group of actors, which shows the great range all of them have. Some are simply unrecognizable from one character to the other and it sometimes takes a good eye to pick them out, which makes it fun. And I don't want to ruin it for anyone, but this film takes some turns that no sane person could see coming.Ridiculous characters in ridiculous situations equals ridiculous laughter.The epitome of all-star comedy that will no doubt continue to stand the test of time. Kudos to Gilliam and the rest of the Python crew. If you haven't seen it yet, make it your first priority in life!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Wonderful movie!,"This is such a great film that a professor of mine actually used it in a Medieval Civilization class as extra credit. This was not because the movie was so historically accurate, but because the movie was so much funnier when we applied what we learned in her class to it! It was really hard to pick only 10 funny lines!To anyone that watched it once and didn't quite get it or got frustrated the first time, here is a tip: Catch it on DVD with the subtitles or closed-captioning on. That way you will be sure to catch all of the French insults and the other one-liners that fly by so fast! I don't recommend doing that with kids in the room - my 7-year-old picked up a couple of words on the screen that he had missed previously...Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
It stands the test of time.,"Whether you love it or hate it, Monty Python is forever etched into British comedy history and this edition of the filmic Python exploits has stood the test of time, just.The thing with Monty Python is that it's very random. The bizarreness and variedness of the humour is really something to behold and there are numerous examples in this film alone which backs this up. Whether it's a completely random and insane discussion-come-argument about swallows to a really scathing, surreal attack on how the English dealt with the 'black death' or the 'plague' or whatever killer virus' were going around back then, in the carefree manner that is shown. It can be a joy to behold.With this film, we are instantly thrown into a world of confusion as the 'projectionist' actually loads up the wrong film to begin with. From here, you know something's up as no other film that I've ever seen or heard of has a beginning like this and you know that this is going to be different. Once the real film has started, the dialogue in the early scenes superbly juxtaposes the setting in 900 odd B.C. as political arguments and, as I've mentioned, discussions about migratory birds pop up. It feels like an extra long episode of a comic, sketch TV programme which has no real plot, but is just a montage of jokes and hilarious situations the characters find themselves in and this isn't a bad thing. The great thing about this is, is that the early situations and exchanges work as a flame for us, the moths, and it sets the stage very well; drawing us into the world of humour on show. Since no one around now knows exactly what happened in the time of the films setting, no one can argue whether any of this would really happen. Were minstrels who followed people/knights around that annoying? What did knights guarding the turrets of castles actually do/talk about to pass the time? Swallows maybe? Effective little scenarios like this make you wonder and it just adds to the genius of the writing.One of the early scenes has to be one of the funniest in films entire one hundred year plus history. This is the fight scene between Arthur and the black knight. Following on from a good fight scene, the black knight delivers some of the funniest lines in the most funniest of ways following his own decapitation. The line: 'All right, we'll call it a draw.' has me in stitches just thinking about it.One quarrel I have with the film is the animated sequences. Now, they look terribly dated and really aren't that funny. Fortunately, they only last a few seconds (most of them) and don't distract you too much but why even bother to have them in the first place? The titles in-between the knight's own separate stories are fine but little things like the 'artist suddenly having a heart attack' just insult the viewer. Not good, unfortunately.I think most people would have a problem with the characters who talk to the screen, breaking the 'fourth wall', something which was stamped out of narrative film-making decades ago. I had a minor frustration with this as although it only happened twice from memory, it spoilt what was a perfectly good/funny scene. The incident in the castle full of young girls is the one which immediately springs to mind as she starts talking to the audience. In an analytical sense, this is actually supposed to add to the experience in the sense that it's all theatre anyway and this film shouldn't be taken seriously. It's fun and farcical and that's all that matters. I didn't let it get away with it when it came to the rating, though.This film's great to watch alone, especially if you've not seen it either before or for a very long time. If you've never experienced Python before, then this is a great appetiser and remember  there are two other films and plenty of TV series' as-well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"With some ups and downs, still really good","The first 20 minutes are comedy gold, with typical Python intelligence, which means smarts combined with pure silliness in surgical precision, elevating the whole.After that, the movie has 60 minutes of ups and downs, not always overcoming the lack of budget, sometimes overusing the ""breaking the fourth wall"" joke, or just focusing in a less funny joke just a bit too long.Still, overall, it's impossible to say the quality isn't good, because for every bad segment, with get an opposite amazing one.

an acquired taste...,"All my life I've heard how funny Monty Python and the Holy Grail was but I had never seen it. Being in college, a group of my friends all wanted to watch it so I decided to join, excited to finally see this movie for which I've heard so much praise. I could see how people find the movie funny but I could not get into it. I kept wanting to leave but was determined to see it through to its end... and actually, I'm glad I did because the ending ""credits"" where it's several minutes of music playing to a black screen was the only thing that made me laugh from the movie. I respect the movie because it so widely loved so I'm not trying to bash it, yet I definitely think, as with any sort of humor, it is not for everyone. There are countless types of humor: dry, sarcastic, physical, nonsense, political etc. and everyone has their own taste as to which they prefer. With a movie like Monty Python, which has a very certain type of humor attached to it, there are bound to be those who dislike it. I only leave this comment to let those of you who have not yet seen the movie hear a ""different"" sort of opinion, as nearly all of the comments here highly praise the movie.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
You'll love it or hate it,"Monty Python will always be loved or hated depending on your personality. And this is Monty Python at its typical best. If you like daft jokes, killer fluffy animals, bad accents and intelligent discussions that will most likely go over your head the first time round, then you will love The Holy Grail.The jokes vary from obvious visual puns (coconut halves to represent horses) and audio puns (""I am Roger the Shrubber"") to more subtle and intelligent jokes (""I thought we were an autonomous collective"" / the Witch-burning scene). The greatest thing about the Holy Grail is that there's something for everyone. No one is left out.What many don't realise is the sophisticated intelligence behind the jokes that many of later generations don't understand (back in the Life of Brian - Romani Ite Domun - which wouldn't have such impact on the youngsters who never had to suffer through Latin classes) such as the witch burning scene, where it was true that any means possible was used to warp the natural and legal laws to create the desired result i.e. one less warty woman in the village, and how the mish-mash of Celtic tribes were suddenly forced to become a diplomacy (""Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony!""). It always reminds me of Blackadder - how so many great jokes were wasted by bad timing or bad judgement on the audience's vocabulary.And for those who can't keep up with historical jokes, there's the Black Knight, Tim, and Zoot to keep you occupied. They sure as hell make me laugh.So if you like daft humour, go for it! But promise to check out the subtle jokes as well. It's worth the effort, and you'll learn a little about history too.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Pure Lunacy,"Well, if you want original humor, meaning something different than what you normally see - this is your ticket. The above statement was true 30 years ago, and still holds. It's just silly, far-out humor.It's not all winners, no comedy is, but there are enough of them, and enough classic bizarre scenes that it's always a hoot to re-visit this film from time to time. The only problem I have with it are the cheap shots in gives - in typical 1970s fashion - of anything Biblical. But, it's not that bad and most of the film is pretty innocent.It's pretty much one ludicrous scene after another. I mean, where else do you see a knight fighting on after his legs are chopped off, then his arms?!! Or a killer rabbit? It was almost like watching a Marx Brothers film 40 years later with '70s irreverence.Don't let the PG rating fool you. This would be an easy PG-13 today with all the blood, some cursing and the violence. I know some young kids, however - nice kids, too - who love this film as much as adults, so it can't be too offensive.If I had to describe this movie in one word it would be ""lunacy.""",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
An example of why British humor is much smarter than ours.,"This is how to make a comedy. Laughs can be found throughout, and the 4th wall falls apart throughout the film without any actors chewing the scenery. The movie from the first scene, and on is great. The acting is wonderful. Everybody in the cast delivers the jokes hilariously. Also the the actors never seem to overact at all. There are a few jokes that go on for to long, but it is aware of this. If only another comedy that doesn't deserve to have its name mentioned (cough Disaster Movie cough) was self-aware that the jokes it had were to long. It really is a shame that British people can say that they have awesome comedies like this, and we have a lot of awful comedies like (sigh) Disaster Movie. This film is a work of genius.4 stars out of 4",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
The most memorable comedy of all time,"Name another context where the line ""your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries"" is funny. If it's not John Cleese as the taunting Frenchman or said in that very same obnoxiously fake French accent, it's about as funny as missing tea time.""The Holy Grail,"" far and away the greatest comedic work of the Monty Python gang of Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, John Cleese, Michael Palin and Terry Gilliam is a masterful example of the power of improvisational humor and satire. It is also testament that nonsense, when executed properly, is brilliance.No comedy can even touch what King Arthur and the knights of the round table's divinely charged quest for the Holy Grail does. Whether it is a rant about various forms of government, a tragically flawed scientific logic for burning witches or knights who keep sacred words like ""Ni"" and demand shrubberies, just about everything in the film is memorable, quotable or at least highly enjoyed by those with bad recall abilities.The Middle Ages is perfect fodder for Monty Python, mixing a definite sense of history with tales of fantasy -- the ideal balance for satire and nonsensical fun. But truly, comedy is about timing and execution and no one does it better. The subtleties of ""I'm not dead yet"" and ""i'm getting better"" are examples. Delivered in another way they could miss the mark entirely, but the Python crew gets just about anything to be funny. A definite improvisational element keeps the scenes fresh and all the more hilarious.""Holy Grail"" nails joke after joke and only lacks a satisfying end. Still, the sheer comedic genius of the rest of the film is so good that the whole unit is meaningless. You don't walk away thinking it's a bad ending, you start quoting the taunting Frenchman, or the leader of the nights who say ""Ni!"" or the Black Knight. That's what makes the film a true classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Classic British Humor!,"As we all know, the Brits have fantastic humor.

This was one I came to late, I was in my 20s before I watched this film for the first time, but boy do I wish I had seen it earlier in life. The comedy in the film is perfect for me, and every line is delivered with the perfect amount of sarcasm and wit. To some this may seem too stupid or silly, but I think it's borderline brilliant. The film has way too many jokes and gags to choose a favorite but to me some of the best are the black night at the bridge, the French, and of course the ""huge tracks of land"" quotes 🤣🤣🤣 I don't want to really give much detail about what the this movie is about because it's just an experience you have to enjoy for yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

The ending that all this is really just a fantasy (so to speak) about a fantasy saga actually is quite funny. Is does end abruptly, but even that is fine in the context of a wacky movie.

Another hilarious comedy from the Pythons!,"After the brilliant Life of Brian, I was looking forward to watching Monty Python and the Holy Grail. And I loved it, I don't think it is quite as good as Life of Brian, but it is definitely one of the better Monty Python comedies for sheer hilarity and fun. The story like Life of Brian isn't the strongest component but this is in no way a criticism and yes the special effects are cheesy but perhaps that was the intention. My only problem with the film was that the ending is a little flat, but that is a minor criticism compared to how much I loved this film. The script is irreverent and highly quotable, and the soundtrack is even funnier. As a comedy it is wonderfully inventive, that debunks the Dark Ages and legends of chivalry through King Arthur, The Black Knight, God and the ""knights who say ni"". Comedy highlights include the trial with Connie Booth's witch and the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch sequence. Even the sets are quite well designed and authentic. And the acting is simply wonderful, John Cleese, Terry Jones(the encounter with Dennis's mother was hilarious), Graham Chapman, Terry Gilliam, Michael Palin and Eric Idle perfectly live up to their exceptional talents.

Warning-you could laugh yourself to death,"You really could laugh yourself to death watching this movie. It is nothing but hilarious. Monty Python keeps pounding and pounding you with gag after gag, and lead you down a road, but suddenly its a bridge, no, its an ocean. One of the things that really makes this hilarious is the grand spectacle that dazzles you with attention to grand sound effects, and then the next scene may be purposely cheap sets, all to make you laugh yourself to death. There is crude humor, and what I think can fairly be described as dark humor-you might not think its funny to see an animal with big teeth rip several knights to death, or a knight have his arms and legs cut off, but Monty Python will make you laugh at it. I personally think they're akin to Marx Brothers comedy, or Mel Brooks-hilarious with likable people in outrageous situations.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Absurd humor, or the hard life of king Arthur","Humor on an absurd, abstract, and partly cult, level set in the the Middle Ages. Monty Python's first film gives birth to the famous Knights of Ni, the Castle of Aargh, the Capital of Assyria, Just a fleshwound and other unforgettable little masterpieces. Some less famous but equally hilarious jokes only wait to be discovered on second viewing.Filmed without any substantial budget, Monty Python and the Quest for the Holy Grail features a number of jokes that were born out of poverty, the most famous are the 'horses'. Perhaps(?) unintended but also comical is the dialogue alternating between lines as in medieval literature and normal talk. The basic ingredients are quests, knights, castles, dangers, tests and temptations, animation, and a little bit of witchcraft. Less unorthodox and anachronistic ingredients are of course also present. A few jokes may seem vaguely reminiscent of obscure earlier work, for those who know the Flying Circus series by heart.Basically the stories narrate the hard times for King Arthur as the England of that time with it many strange inhabitants doesn't seem fit for his rule. First he has to find the knights for his round table. Next God grants him the Quest, but it is far from easy and the knights split up. Following some ridiculous separate adventures, their paths come together once again when they find an enchanter who has a lead to the grail. Nothing turns out the way you'd expect, and even after the dangerous bridge of death Arthur is not free of trouble. The ending is rather odd and once again mainly due to lack of money.Made in 1975, its appeal still has not diminished even though the idea behind the humor has been copied many times (with less success). Given the poor circumstances in which the Monty Python team made this film (complete lack of funds, no experience in movie industry, use national castles denied shortly before filming began, a drunk Graham Chapman), I for one regard it as their best film.Note - many interesting facts about the jokes, the locations, the cast and such are too detailed to list here, but can be found on the DVD.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Now watch this movie or I shall taunt you for a second time!,"I will preface this by saying that while I'm not a big Monty Python fan, when they get it right, it is brilliant. The show had some great sketches, but some were just bizarre and incomprehensible. The movie is 100% on the mark, starting from the titles with subtitles to its off the wall ending.It would be a disservice to explain the movie and the great scenes in this review. But a few things to note.First, when you take into account that this film was done in 1974, most medieval movies of the time were glamorous set pieces with handsome knights and beautiful princesses. The Pythons skewered this notion completely: Arthur and his knights were commonplace blokes, and the sets were in some muggy, ugly areas. This may have been a budgetary issue, but interestingly enough, they probably depicted medieval England more authentically than even films nowadays.Second, the amount of times the fourth wall is broken are numerous, and just goes to shows how dementedly hilarious the movie gets, but yet still holds the story well.That said, if you have never seen Monty Python (who hasn't?), this is a whole different level of comedy--yes, silly is about right, but not in the crude ""Paul Blart"" or ""Larry the Cable Guy"" type of silly, but at the same time, not the cerebral ""Dr. Strangelove"" type of silliness.Must watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Sublime silliness,"Silly boys. Those Monty Python chaps send up the King Arthur legend as only they could. Silliness from beginning to end. But silliness can be brilliant you know. And there is some truly inspired stuff in this movie. It's a farcical parody in which the laughs come fast and furious. You've got a three-headed knight. You've got a knight who just won't quit, no matter how many ""flesh wounds"" you inflict upon him. You have knights who sing about that silly place known as Camelot. And of course you have knights who say ""Ni!"" You have snooty, condescending French persons and their flying livestock. You have rabbits, both Trojan and killer. You have a unique use for coconuts and the question of whether coconuts can migrate. All of this surrounding the main plot, the quest for the Holy Grail. Oh who are we kidding, there really is no plot. The movie just careens from one gag to the next.The movie is brilliantly performed by the Pythons, each of whom takes on multiple roles. Graham Chapman, playing King Arthur, is the glue that holds everything together. All the nonsense revolves around him. Chapman is the straight man, if this movie could be said to have such a thing. Everyone else gets to be gleefully silly while Chapman's Arthur is a little more restrained as he focuses on his noble quest. But Chapman is as funny as any of the others. Arthur's Knights of the Round Table meanwhile are a quirky, eclectic bunch and each provides plenty of laughs as they go off in their own directions seeking the Grail. And for as good as they are portraying their respective Knights it is in the other characters they also play that the Pythons perhaps shine brightest. How can you not love John Cleese's Taunting French Guard? Michael Palin is great as the peasant Dennis who bemoans the class system and questions Arthur's legitimacy. Palin also plays the King of Swamp Castle and Terry Jones does great as heir to the swamp Prince Herbert. Among other things Eric Idle is a great dead collector, shrubber and monk. Terry Gilliam has comparatively little screen time but makes his own contributions with his great animation as well as co-directing the whole thing with Jones. No small task pulling all this film's wonderful nonsense together so Gilliam and Jones have to be given a great deal of credit for their directing work. The movie is really let down only by its ending. It's jarring and abrupt, the Pythons pulling the rug out from beneath their audience. It's typical Python though. But this last bit of silliness doesn't really work. For all the great stuff that came before the movie deserved a better conclusion than this. But a misstep right at the end isn't going to detract too much from the overall experience. This movie is funny, brilliant and thoroughly enjoyable from the opening credits all the way to the end. Well near the end anyway. Easy to see why this is one of the most beloved comedies ever.

Peasants who know social politics, animal kingdom studies plus a king arthur who seems to be a total idiot yet always getting by with great ""moves"". The ""inocence"" of people in king arthur's time is replaced with cunning remarks and stunning situations. You can recognize many stuff in this movie from children books and history movies, but it's all modified to give it a really laughing sense.I won't say much more because i do not wish to be a spoiler, yet i say that if you like non-sense laughing stuff and especially the monthy python's then movie is definitely for you, otherwise do stay away or you'll spent everything else but a nice time.What's the airspeed velocity of a swallow? - what do you mean, African or European?i give it 10 cause i've never laughed so much in my life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
I know I am the minority.... I am very disappointed,"I just finished watching this movie and was extremely disappointed. I had previously seen The Life Of Brian and The Meaning Of Life (which in my opinion were bad and worse, respectively), and although this is the highlight of the series, I am not impressed. Maybe I just don't get British humour (well really, it's not about ""not getting it"", it's more about just not finding it funny), but I don't find this movie entirely funny. Maybe others do, and kudos to them! But this doesn't entertain me. I'm not saying I didn't laugh though. There were humorous and hilarious parts, but I was hyped up and expecting a gut busting movie, so I was disappointed. The coconuts were humorous (funny the first time, then it became tedious), I laughed my ass off when John Cleese decapitated an entire wedding party, and when he in turn was decapitated (albeit in an earlier scene). I also thought the Killer rabbit was extremely hilarious, and the bridge was funny too. Also, the logic of the witch burning was amusing. But 10 minutes of funny from a 1 and a half hour movie isn't too good, especially since I heard this movie is a comedy classic. This is one of the reasons I have mixed feelings about Dogma as well. There are some friggin' hilarious parts, but some boring parts as well (I understand they are moving the plot along, and respect that). However, I just enjoy Dogma more. Back to The Holy Grail. I just am so underwhelmed. I'm trying really hard to like Monty Python, but I just can't. However, the movie is not bad. It has it's moments, and for that it gets.......6/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

I used to think this was the funniest movie ever made.,"Being brought up on Python going to see this movie on its original release was one of the highlights of my movie going childhood. For many years I thought 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' was the funniest movie ever made. Now over twenty five years later repetition and familiarity may not have ruined the movie completely but they have spoiled my enjoyment somewhat. Even so it's still a comedy classic and I envy anyone who is watching it for the first time. Python (Cleese, Chapman, Palin, Jones, Idle and Gilliam) were on top form throughout, and apart from one or two less successful bits it's hilarious stuff, and arguably their most consistent movie. (I still think their TV work was their best, the non-linear sketch format suiting their style more than extended pieces). Python bores can quote this verbatim but don't let them put you off. This is one wacked out romp full of fun and surprises, and still has more laughs than 90% of today's so-called comedies. Highly recommended.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Old but gold,"Monty Python and the Holy Grail is the very definition of ""old but gold"". This is a comedy that I've watched several times and it especially grew on me during my latest watch with me being a bit older and being able to understand some of the jokes that went over my younger head.I love this movie, but don't get me wrong I think a lot of people won't. The humour is straight up insane. I'd describe it as a combination of satire and surreal humour (also known as absurdist humour according to wikipedia). Some won't like it at all and at some points it doesn't hit home all the way or gets a bit boring when a joke drags on for too long but most of the time I find the movie hilarious as I like that sort of humour.I am having a hard time explaining it but you'll understand why if you watch the movie. I think everyone should at least give it a try. Watch the opening 10-15 minutes which are a pretty good representation of what the movie is going to be like and then decide whether to watch it or not. I liked it a lot and I highly recommend it if you are into satire and absurd comedy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Probably one of the funniest British films of all time,"I remember watching this 1975 British comedy film for the first time on DVD when I was a teenager. I thought I found it very entertaining and also hilarious especially the French taunter (played by John Cleese as we know) himself. The French taunter always cracks me up! He's probably the funniest Monty Python character I have ever seen. It's probably one of the best British films of all time.

A film which was an unusual but true life changing experience for me,When the Monty Python programmes started on British TV in the late 1960's I tuned into the humour from the first second and what made them that little bit more amusing was that my dad just didn't get any of it. We both laughed at other comedians or comedy films but the Monty Python experience was not one that appealed to him. I highly recommend anyone watch this film because you will find out whether you find it funny or not and from my point of view I hope you find it as highly amusing as I do. I cannot adequately describe the film itself its just the Monty Python experience in full flow and firing on all cylinders. I have watched the film numerous times and it still presses all my buttons where humour is concerned. This particular piece of cinematic brilliance had a life changing effect on me and although their will be many out there that will be doubtful or incredulous I myself have no doubts about how significant this film was for me. At the time the Monty Python team in my opinion were a groundbreaking new broom in comedy and set the standard which very few aspiring comedians have been able to match let alone emulate.

High rating should come with a warning label,"Don't get me wrong, I understand how this film is considered humorous and well put together for its meager budget, but it being crowned one of the top movies ever made I find myself with my jaw dropped.How is this movie any different from the other purposely stupid comedies like Dumb and Dumber? People who find a liking to Monty Python think that those who don't like it just don't get the humor because it's too intelligent for them. Actually, on the contrary, they do get it and they just don't think it's funny. Monty Python is dumb humor, per se, and there's nothing really unique about it except its setting.If this movie deserves to be in the top 250 of comedy so do films like Dumb and Dumber, Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle do as well ... and i'm dead serious. The only reason this film is bumped so high is the thousands of those akin to nerd culture who for some reason highly value the movie come here and give it a 10/10.It's too silly and hollow to be given such a high status. It belongs to a certain group of moviegoers and, quite honestly the majority of people find no pleasure in this type of entertainment. To call it genius or the funniest movie ever made is exaggeration. It's good, but it isn't great; I honestly don't think it was filmed with the intention of making cinematic history.If that's one thing that makes it great, then you can treat it that way. But as far as I'm concerned, the high rating for this film is very misleading. It should come with a warning label:ACQUIRED TASTE.6/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
It grows on you- it's one of the most delightful exercises in the ridiculous in cinema history,"For years I did not watch or listen to Monty Python, and in retrospect I can't entirely remember why. I remember seeing a couple of scenes from ""The Holy Grail"" on television when I was younger (the notorious 'black knight' scene and the harem of girls in the castle) and not finding it uproarious as I might have expected. Maybe I'm just not into British comedy, I thought ignorantly. Then I finally gave into it, as I got to be a big fan of Terry Gilliam's films, and discovered as well that John Cleese is one of the funniest people to ever come out of Britain. Life of Brian was surprisingly witty and fun as it dug its claws into a subject of some controversy. Then I went on to this film, and it took two times to watch the film until I found it to definitely be a truly masterful effort in the delirious.The first time some of the jokes and gags and puns and visuals flew over my head, but as an emotional experience (if one could call it that) was immediate- many of the parts were funny as hell, even if I didn't think the whole was. The second time around everything fit, I laughed harder at the jokes I laughed at before, and I was officially a fan of the movie. Like another comedy classic than came out a year previous to Holy Grail, Blazing Saddles, the whole story is rather inconsequential when it comes to the set-pieces and actors in the various roles. King Arthur and the knights see a strange, God-like figure in the sky (my biggest laugh the first time around, one of many genius illustrations from Gilliam) who tells them to find the Holy Grail. So off they go, and encounter a plethora of trials and tribulations along the way.In fact, the whole film is an act of stream-of-consciousness (as was the television show, Flying Circus) where the animated bits are instrumental in taking the shape of the story, or 'skits' in the film. My personal favorites were the 'black knight', the knights who say 'ni', the 'killer rabbit' (one of the great comedy surprises I have had recently), and the boy who ""just wants to...sing!"". But even when a weaker bit might come along, it may be a bit that doesn't lack the fine visual detail and look provided by Gilliam and Terry Jones, or with some form of wit (i.e. I didn't find the ""bring out your dead"" scene as extraordinary, but I wouldn't doubt it's original).Although many say that Monty Python and the Holy Grail, which starts and ends with total disregard (and fitfully so) for all logical rules in storytelling, that it's one of the funniest films ever made (which it very well could be), I feel only very slightly reserved in recommending it to anyone. If you're in the mood for a bloody, moody, very low-budget dip into medieval satire by five of Britain's most talented writer/actors (not to mention to 'token' American), it's for you. But it may prove too silly, and maybe too sporadic, to work as a whole. One thing that I can say without a doubt, however, is that it serves as an audacious move in post-modern comedy. To put it another way, Monty Python (not just this film but the TV show, movies, and albums) were a major influence on the guys who do South Park. It's crude, odd fun practically by necessity- you know what you're getting right when ""Dentist on the Job"" is just 'accidentally dropped in before the movie even starts!

Very silly yet brilliant,"Like so many pleasures in life, the typical Monty Python fare is a bit of an acquired taste. Their comedy series, ""Flying Circus,"" had many funny moments, but I would estimate that 70% of it was just very silly stuff that was so outlandish and off the wall that it didn't have much of a wide appeal.Holy Grail had more than its share of silliness as well, but it seemed that the troupe really had outdone themselves here with clever and original material. Some of the bits were so outrageously funny that I must have nearly split my sides laughing at the first viewing with a few friends. And they hurt afterwards as well, so I was apparently not the only one who loved this type of humor.In typical Pythonesque fashion, much of the humor here is black comedy, with bits of gore sprinkled throughout. There was no swearing or nudity that I recall, which is odd for a comedy, instead there was a great deal of violence. It's almost a bit of a satire on the tendency for media outlets to be bastardized for nudity or sexuality, while extreme violence is often viewed as fine for all audiences.What it really amounted to was the Pythons making light of the oft untouchable British legend of the immortal King Arthur. There are so many quotable lines and bits of clever dialog that I could probably see the movie a hundred more times and still be heartily amused.

Irreverent and often sidesplitting nonsense comedy/satire of Middle Age movies that will probably like to nutty humor fans , including many Political and Social comments . Both John Cleese and Terry Gilliam performed all their stunts during the duel between Black and Green Knight , they both had to learn to manage big and heavy swords and to do some acrobatics, though never being recognizable, wearing both heavy armors and full helmets . The French tactic of pelting Arthur and his knights with livestock echoes the relatively modern legend of a medieval siege of the fortified southern French town of Carcassonne ; said to have been near starvation, the townspeople used the last of their food to pelt the besieging army to convince them, suffering likewise, that the town was well stocked with food and that the siege was hopeless. Adequate production design , he interiors of Camelot and Swamp Castle, and exteriors of Castle Anthrax, French Castle and the opening castle were all shot at Doune Castle . Recently-rebuilt Castle Stalker was used for the Castle Aarrgg ; however the Scottish Department of the Environment withdrew permission for the Pythons to shoot within their castles, saying that the film's script would be ""incompatible with the history and fabric"" of the castles . The flick was imaginatively directed by Terry Gilliam , an expert on wonderful , surreal atmospheres such as Baron Munchausen , Twelve monkeys , Time bandits , Brazil , Fisher king , Jabberwocky and Heath Leger's last film : Doctor Parnasus . The film might be described as an extraordinary Medieval fantasy full of imagination and color . Six cast members played various characters such as Graham Chapman , John Cleese , Terry Gilliam , Eric Idle , Terry Jones and Michael Palin who plays the most characters , 12 .

"""zany madcap humour""","Arthur, King of the Britons, who doesn't have a horse and instead bangs coconuts together to fool his subjects into thinking he has, decides to amass a rag-bag of knights to his Round Table - the daredevil Lancelot, the pure Galahad, the foolish Bedevere, the cowardly Robin.  God (in wonderful cartoon form) then challenges him to find the Holy Grail - cue the split stories as each knight has their own 'adventure' whilst trying to locate the precious relic.This being Python it is obviously going to be very silly.  The Knights Who Say 'Ni!' are one of the highlights, as is the exceptionally camp prince (Terry Jones) who is in a tall tower waiting to be rescued, the killer bunny rabbit, and Sir Robin's band of minstrels.  Graham Chapman plays Arthur in a quasi-Shakespearean fashion which at least makes the character memorable, and there are neat cameos from the likes of Connie Booth and Carol Cleveland, both honorary Pythons from the BBC TV series.It isn't a perfect movie and isn't consistently funny - however as a send-up of historical epics it does the job very well.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

One of the few truly great comedies all the way through,"King Arthur and his knights try to find the Holy Grail in the midst of very peculiar circumstances.Forget (if you ever knew) the Holy Grail was invented by a fiction writer named Cretien de Troyes in the 1190s, that the word ""grail"" comes from a word known locally on Troyes, and it wasn't originally a cup (that attribution came from Cistercian monks in the next century trying to draw parallels to the recently invented Grail to the Eucharist). In fact, the second person ever to write a Grail book (again in the 1190s) called it a stone.I'd never heard the word Grail when this movie came out. I only knew, in early high school, I and a close group of friends were maniacs for the brand new (in America) ""Monty Python's Flying Circus.""It was ages before I knew what a Grail was, but I howled all through the movie (as did everyone else in the theatre) and still do, though then the Grail was to me then no more than a ""McGuffin,"" like secret papers, etc.I have watched this movie sparingly during the intervening half-century because I don't want to dilute it. But every time I return to it I'm reaffirmed in my belief it's among the top dozen (perhaps half-dozen) comedies ever.Monty Python humor is a specialized admixture of college-boy showing-off (most of the group went to Oxford or Cambridge) and pure, unadulterated silliness. If you don't like or understand either, you might do well to stay away.It's called ""dated"" by some critics, but utter goofiness can't be dated. What they probably mean is that subsequent lesser humorists have robbed Monty Python blind (Kenneth Branagh even had the audacity to steal the coconut shell bit for a Shakespeare movie!)If you don't like or can't comprehend the lopsided Monty Python universe, stick with something more straightforward.

Great fun with some classic comedy moments,"The Monty Python crew do the legend of King Arthur.The Holy Grail packs a fair punch considering it's budget, largely thanks to the comic talents of the Pythons who are very funny in most scenes of dialogue and sight gags.It is best not have expectations of a coherent plot as it is a feature length spoof comedy.

Monty python review ! contains minor story elements!,"! Please do note that this critic contains minor story elements, read to your own risk (read last sentence for final review without spoilers) !Monty Python and the Holy Grail by is a comedic movie written by Graham Chapman that presents the heroic adventures of Arthur, King of the Britons, and his knights of the roundtable in their quest to find, you guessed it, the Holy Grail. We will talk about the acting in the film and the highlight of the film: the comedy. For starters, the actors were able to act out the entire movie with hilarious scenes without breaking character once. They kept their character in order throughout the movie without changing the vocal expressions used from each one of the characters and played them remarkably well, we can witness the acting during the tale of Arthur (Graham Chapman) and Bedevere (Terry Jones). Now, about the comedy, I believe it is fair to say that most of those who watched the movie would say the film is a comedic masterpiece. And fair to say they are mostly right; the comical aspect of this movie is what makes Monty python and the holy grail well... Monty python and the holy grail! The comedy is actually well researched in this movie and used to its full potential so much that it gets absurd, if watched carefully. You can see hidden jokes about the jokes made in the movie 10 minutes ago and even breach the fourth wall from the movie itself. Although, in some parts of the movie, the comedy does get shallow like in the intermissions between the knight's tales, where animated childish jokes ruin the great humor presented throughout the film.Out of it all, it's a great movie, the acting is great for the style of movie it is, and the humor is the selling point in this movie. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

There is no question that the Python team were talented comedians; that this film was excellent in its time and that its influences are still being felt today.

I think The Life of Brian is still a great piece of comedy and can be enjoyed as much today as it could 20 years ago but not The Holy Grail. Having watched nearly every episode of sitcoms such as Fawlty Towers, Only Fools and Horses and Blackadder before the film I can see that these shows have built on the comedy of The Holy Grail and are finer works because of it. But having seen these before the film I found the humour old fashioned, outdated and *gasp* predictable, something which would not be true when it was released. People have claimed that young people today do not 'get' comedies such as this but I would say that humour has evolved and now slicker, more sophisticated comedies have left dinosaurs such as this little more than reference points in comedy history.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

A wonderfully funny comedic spectacle,"The Holy Grail is probably one of the funniest movies I have ever watched. It's satirical tones are just hilarious, from the title sequences to the cut scenes, it just makes it such an enjoyable movie to watch. From the ""she's a witch"" to ""bring out the dead"". It just makes me laugh so much. The cut scenes are the funniest, and the narration make it so hilarious. Monty Python really knows what he is doing. Another hilarious scene is the fight between Sir Arthur and the Knight where he says ""it's just a flesh wound"", I thought that was just perfect movie history. Overall I give this movie a well deserved rating.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A  Unique and Original Comedy Classic,"In spite of Viet Nam, Watergate and gas shortages the 70's was a period of superb film humor. Giants like Woody Allen and Mel Brooks were in their prime and British export Monty Python had established a beach front on American television. When the Python's released their first feature length film audiences expected waves of absurdity and ""silliness"". They received more.Based (or spring boarded) on the Arthurian legend of the quest for the Holy Grail, Monty Python and the Holy Grail is screamingly hilarious from its opening credits to its final scene. Coconuts, killer rabbits, flying cows and holy hand grenades fill the landscape as the Python troupe immerse themselves in multiple roles, skewering legend and establishment with their surreal brand of humor. They all shine individually but Cleese as dimwitted Lancelot, Tim the Enchanter, a witch burner and a castle guard with an ""outrageous French accent"" is most memorable for me. There is also the creative collage animation of Terry Gilliam which fits seamlessly into the zaniness of the location footage by transitioning without a break in storyline or humor from one knight's adventure to the next.In addition to its abundance of original non-stop laughs, attention to detail in ambiance and composition (Gilliam directed the camera work, Terry Jones the actors) gives Grail an impressive look. Castles, forests, a Viking Ship are photographed in epic style giving the film a high gloss while at the same time heightening the comic absurdity.I was a year out of college when Grail was released. I had no steady job and no prospects but I saw this film eight times in that year (a personal record to this day) and that alone made it a very good year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Pull the other one!,"Proof, yet again, that the biggest budget will get you nothing but fancy effects.  The script is the most important part, and this one sizzles.

There is physical comedy, musical comedy ""It's only a model"". And of course it wouldn't be a Monty Python movie without ripping ""society"" a new butt.  ""Oh, King, eh?  Very nice.""

One of the pinnacles of British humour.,"This was my first contact with Monty Python, which I already knew famously, and I loved the movie. It is quite simply one of the high points of British humour. The film is easy enough to understand, parodying the Arthurian legends surrounding the quest for the Grail, but the story is just a pretext for successive jokes, each one better than the last.I don't know the group of comedians very well, but I do know a number of great British comedy actors here, starting with John Clease, Terry Jones, Graham Chapman, Terry Gilliam, Michael Palin and Eric Idle. They are very good individually, but priceless together.The film has several moments worth mentioning, starting perhaps with the witch trial, and then moving on to the fight with the black knight or the knights who say Ni. It's not a very long film, but it's really worth seeing every comic situation. The dialogues are full of hilarious moments. The ending, however, is a little less strong than expected, which does not take away from the film any of its merit.Technically, it's not a remarkable film. There is no concern here with historical accuracy or rigorous recreation of the Middle Ages, nor does the film ask for it. We have stage costumes and props, obviously fake but functional, and interesting sets, in castles and in some reasonably well chosen places. There are some special effects and visuals, but they aren't notable. Be that as it may, it's a comedy that remains fresh despite the decades that have passed since its debut.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Still one of the best comedies of all time,"Even some 30 years after it's release this still seems very fresh. Monty Python was classic comedy and this was the best Python film.

Great CLASSIC Movie,"Sorry that mattymatt4ever doesn't get it, he prolly just SAW the movie when he wrote his review in 2001. You have to understand the movie in CONTEXT, when it was filmed, 1975. It was a low budget film as Python had not hit full popularity in the USA yet. And you couldn't get away with as much as you can NOW in movies.You have to understand what they did was to slap the King Arthur myth right in the puss (""strange women lying in ponds is no means for a democratic system of gvt""), and they were really the 1st ones to do it.And Python tends to keep re-working things in in subtle ways .. the whole swallow conversation at the beginning, later reference to it with Sir Bedevere letting lose a pigeon with something tied to its leg, to the bridge of death where Arthur's knowledge of swallows gets him across the bridge.If you don't like slapstick, combined with sharp wit and a little hint of sex .. then you won't get Python .. and IMHO your life is that much smaller because of it.NI!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Almost painfully good.,"This is one of about three films that I have absolutely nothing bad to say about. The acting is superb, the plot and writing are masterful, and the effects (as usual for the pythons) just connect with me on some level that makes them seem perfect. What i'm about to say may well be cliché'd, but I don't care. The low budget actually improves the film, it adds to the charm the rest of the film exudes so well. There are two reasons I can think of for anyone to not like this film.1) Not being English and not getting our humour. 2) Being a fool.Neither of these detract from the film's perfection. In fact it's probably better than not everyone loves the film; it prevents it from stagnating. To anyone not familiar with the pythons or British humour in general I wholeheartedly recommend this film - you'll never watch anything else.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

The humor is Monty Pythons trade mark, and let's not forget, that even if we've seen crazy humor in other movies, Monty Python invented it. The movie is simply stuffed with classics like swallows with migrating coconuts, the black knight, brave sir Robin, the killer rabbit and the knights who say NI!The holy grail is one of a few movies made by MP, and is by far the best. I'd say ""Life of Brian"" is almost as good, though not as crazy, but ""Meaning of Life"" is nowhere near. This, however, doesn't make MPatHG any worse, so straight 10 from me!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Narrowly beats Life of Brian as the finest British comedy,"There are faults with this film, the cinematography is far from ideal, in parts it is poorly lit, the camera angles are poor and the sound is not great. However, the Pythons' were given peanuts or should that be coconuts to make Holy Grail so this can be forgiven. And the ending is week, but again they had university students working for 4 pounds a day and they simply ran out of cash to film the intended battle sequence.Despite its shortcomings, in my humble opinion, this is an almost perfect comedy. The Python team - John Cleese, Eric Idle, Graham Chapman, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam and Michael Palin were some of the finest writer/performers of their generation. Each of them went on to be a success in their own right.Cleese is widely regarded as the best writer of his era; Gilliam has made a series of weird and wonderful films;  Jones a writer, director and TV historian; Palin an award winning actor, and numerous TV travelogues; Idle did the Rutles and many other films; Chapman was less successful after Python but continued to act and write before his death from cancer. So for such people to be together in a project is unusual, much like the Beatles in that regard.I digress. Holy Grail has many wonderful moments: The Black Knight, the Witch, the French Taunter, Sir Galahad, the Bridge of Death. Holy Grail is less a plot-driven film more a series of sketches on a Medieval theme but purely brilliant nonetheless.Many cite Life of Brian as the best Python film but for me it seems too clean, too polished for a Python production. As a keen fan of the original TV series, Holy Grail is more true to the Python experience of the BBC  - crude, imperfect genius.  All the obvious pennypinching only makes it funnier - the use of coconuts in place of horses for one.If you are thinking of seeing/renting/buying this film, let me assure you it will be one of the finest cinematic purchases you will ever make.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

your mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries,"""Fetchez la vache!"" is the cry heard from the Frenchman as he taunts the silly English knnnnnnnigits. The Holy Grail is truly a comical masterpiece. With its frequent references to bodily functions and inappropriate sounds, it is full of teenage guy humour, which is fabulously funny. I know you're probably saying ""get on with it!"" but the humour is much too prominent a thing to simply gloss over.During the film, there are many incidents of elderly women beating carpets with felines. The enchanter, Tim, sounds like Billy Connelly and is referred to as the ""manky Scot"".The film is full of wonderful quotable material, which ranges from the Black Knight's swearing to the French taunting. The special features on the DVD are a great opportunity to make a prize idiot of yourself, which includes singing along to the Monk's Chant and striking your forehead with the DVD box. You can also watch parts of the film in Lego and Japanese, which again creates the opportunity for amusing subtitles. The Holy Grail is definitely one to watch.

"a great film, a brillant send-up of medieval movies and lore","The first feature-length film from Monty Python, the quintet of physically and verbally gymnastic British sketch comics, is not only widely considered their funniest, but one of the funniest films ever committed to celluloid. Known for abruptly ending TV skits mid-stream with the segue ""And now for something completely different"" -- due both to their distaste for writing endings and their ADD giddiness to move onward -- the troupe finds uncharacteristic continuity here, examining one fertile topic from each of its absurd angles. Yet the movie is still comprised of distinct segments, any of which could serve as a favorite for fans who want to recite the choicest dialogue and make converts of the uninitiated. But for five minutes of sheer uncontrollable hysterics, one need only watch the scene in which Graham Chapman steadily lops the limbs from a foolishly determined knight, who continues issuing taunts even after he's been totally neutralized. Irritated more than threatened, Chapman's King Arthur keeps hacking at the prating cripple just to shut him up -- it's the only sane reaction in this ridiculous world full of delusional windbags. Chapman is a wonderful constant as the frustrated straight man, and his colleagues lob one demented set piece after another ""in his general direction."" The temptation is to enumerate these clever interludes, but a catapulted cow really needs to be seen to be appreciated. The only time Monty Python and the Holy Grail stumbles is at its sudden ending, a cop-out that's pure Python.

A Hard Day's Knight,"I can't think of another film where I was actually laughing over the inanimate title credits. As an old codger who always brings up the subtitles on anything he watches, I really did think there was something wrong with them here before the penny dropped.So I was on board with the humour straight away which continued with my first sight of Graham Chapman and Terry Gilliam as good King Arthur and his trusty assistant Patsy clip-clopping their horseless way around the countryside trying to muster the future Knights Of The Round Table. Eventually, but not before a titanic duel with the doesn't-know-when-he's-beaten Black Knight, he succeeds in this and following a piece of divine, animated heavenly intervention, the merry band are tasked with finding the Holy Grail.On this wafer-thin premise, the Pythons stitch together set-piece sketches of varying hilarity from Arthur's encounter with some proletarian peasantry, a discussion of the relative migratory capabilities of the African and European swallow, and of course the group's stand-off with the all-powerful Knights who say ""Ni"".On the separate knights' quests you can fairly easily trace the authorship of the pieces, as we see Michael Palin's Sir Gawain the Chaste unwilling rescue from a castle full of siren-like comely nuns, John Cleese's Sir Lancelot and his bull-in-a-china-shop rescue of what he thinks is a damsel in distress at a wedding and Eric Idle's less than valorous mission as the the brave and bold Sir Robin. There are also the bonuses of Gilliam's sometimes vulgar animations and the late Neil Innes's humorous songs.Making a virtue of the necessity of an obviously low budget, by rarely filming interior shots, doubling and tripling up role-playing from scene to scene and just the simple expediency of not wishing to pay for what you'd think would be a casting essential of a group of horses, I laughed loud and often throughout the whole ninety minutes running time.Yes, there's a little bit of casual sexism and one or two mildly stereotypical gay references too but these aren't over-offensive in my view and didn't stop my enjoyment of what I saw.As a fan of the group, for me, it was just great to see them all getting along so well, riffing off each other and producing such a hilarious comedy in the process.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

I fart in your general direction!,"One of my favorite comedies, and Monty Python's best and most irreverent movie is Monty Python and the Holy Grail. The Monty Python troop made three films and had a television series that challenged the status quo by dealing with religion, class welfare, politics and dead parrots. There humor seems as fresh and rebellious today as when it was aired. Sometimes their humor was forced -- some scenes in The Meaning of Lif(e) ; however, Monty Python and the Holy Grail has the perfect mix of antitoletarism, irreverence and silly sots.Speaking of silly sots, the cast of this film -- including Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin -- would later take Hollywood like a fierce Killer Rabbit. The kind that lops off men's 'eds' with fangs three-feet long. Monty Python never quite made the mainstream in America; nevertheless, its actors (and directors) did.Monty Python and the Holy Grail remains a cult favorite amongst geeky young males who play Magic in comic book shops. Many of these men grow up to be comic writers or shrubbery salesmen. These comic writers find many ways to allude (or just plain mention) many scenes in this movie. Examples are the Simpsons, the now defunct Freaks and Geeks and the title of Scorcese's Bringing Out the Dead. However, there is more to this film than fanatical fans. It is the antithesis to The Rocky Horror Picture Show, it is a cult movie that is actually good.Reviews on movies like this one are difficult to write because the charm and essence of the film are in its characters and insane skits. Recapping the plot does nothing to convey the essence of the film unless you write it in an irreverent or silly manner. Since I am beyond that type of blasphemous writing, I should either plod on or quit and do my laundry.I would rather do my laundry later, so I will go on.This film was loosely based on King Arthur and the Holy Grail. I am also sure this film was loosely based on a script. Though the plot is chaotic and the cast few, the movie is funny and witty. My only disagreement with the movie is the forced ending. That is only a scratch, a mere flesh wound to this brilliant comedy -- a fanatical farce that is one of my favorite movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

The Black Knight is a psychopathic serial killer.  The mud people are Fir Bolg members of an Anarchist commune (or is it Socialist?  Anarcho-Syndicalist?) and the Knights are riding along Hadrian's Wall.Even later in life now, as a Celtic scholar, I'm again impressed by their knowledge of myth and history, and by how well they not only satirize, but further illuminate, The Matter of Britain.This film should be required viewing for all classes in Celtic Studies, World Mythology, Marxist Thought in the 20th Century, Folklore, The Applied Sciences, Astronomy, Folk Dancing, Fencing, Witch Hunting, Archery, Shrubbery, Moose Hunting, Religious History and Anarcho-Syndicalist Communes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Here we get British comedy at it's best with Python's weird mix of animation, live action, and interaction with the audience of some sort.  There are many memorable scenes which could be viewed again and again and still be funny. This is what makes this a classic comedy in every sense.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
What the heck did I just see.,"I think this movie put me through shock at how cheesy, corny, stupid, unfunny and how completely pointless it was. What is up with these stupid comedies. I could barely watch the whole movie but still it was very hard for me to watch considering how I have a sick sense of humor. This film just was really not all that funny to me though seriously. Everybody says that this movie is hilarious and it's entertaining well to be honest it's nether. This movie to my opinion is on my top 10 of worst films. This film of course is number 4 on the list because it managed to make me laugh once and only once. People say this movie is good so I will recommend this film to little kids. But other than that I just can not see why this is so funny. I rate this film a 1 out of 10 purely because it doesn't deserve an 8 because I wasted my money on this film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Too funny for words,"Monty Python and the Holy Grail is, in my opinion, the funniest movie ever made.  But there is no real reason why it is so funny.  The skits are not that wierd, and the popular satire is not very evident.  In all honesty, I don't know.  But even now, thirty years after it came out, I still find myself howling with laughter.  It's a dry sort of humor, but it's amazing. Monty Python and the Holy Grail is THE classic comedy.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A constant laugh :-),"This is a very funny movie, woven together by a large number of skits that finally gives a very strange ending. The Monty Pythons really make the most of the absurd and you are constantly thinking: ""Did I miss something?"", and that (apart from other things) makes you want to watch it over and over again. The Plot: King Arthur, king of the Britons is collecting knights to join his court at the Castle Camelot, when all of a sudden, his is given a task by God. He has to find the Holy Grail. This task involves a mysterious Wizard that some call Tim. There is also the Holy Handgranade of Antioc. Other key parts are played by a Shrubber, a furry white rabbit and a cartoonist who suffers a heart-attack. The eating of minstrels is also a source of enjoyment. The completely crazy sense of humor associated with the Monty Pythons is evident in the movie. If you like this movie, you will probably also enjoy ""Eric the Viking"" as well as ""Life of Brian"", both with Monty Python. Funniest moment: The Crossing of the Bridge of Death. Oh, and when the Black Knight wont give up. Oh, and when the furry little rabbit turns out to be quite nasty. And so on, and so on... You must see it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Exceptional, strange, funny and absurd movie of Monty Python...","When I first saw this, I must admit I was a tiny bit skeptic to a low-budget movie starring John Cleese. I had seen Clockwise before I saw this movie, and I had a bad experience with that one. When that's been said, I must say I still laugh when I think of the scenes in this movie.The opening is one of the most special opening scenes I have ever seen. I saw this movie along with the rest of my class, and I'm pretty sure they didn't know what on earth that was going on. Our teacher said nothing of what kind of movie this was, so everyone thought it was serious until about 2 minutes into the opening scene. From there on, everyone knew that it would be an absurd, though funny movie. Since there are so many strange and silly obstacles, and so incredibly absurd humor, this movie is one strange, though extremely funny way of picturing the knights of the round table.The acting is this movie is also flawless. The characters act silly and ignorant, funny and gullible, everything expected from a Monty Python movie. Now, I haven't seen very many Monty Python movies or series, but I have seen Life of Brian, Meaning of life and Monthy Python and the holy grail. These are what I mean to be his best movies.A glittering 10 out of 10 from me. A must-see for Monty Python fans and those who hasn't seen it 20 times...",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

But instead of a story about knights and princesses, I got one of the most amazing comedies I had ever watched. There are so many jokes from this movie that stuck with me after just one sitting, and I have watched it many times since.The unique, absurd humor of Monty Python might not be for everyone, but it instantly became a favorite for me, and I rented many more works from them after watching the Holy Grail. An epic movie, that every person must watch once in their lives, even if it is just to figure out whether they want to delve deeper in the crazy world of Monty Python.Also, on the DVD release extras, there was a song from the movie reenacted with LEGO figurines, and a 'documentary' for coconuts, make sure to look for those when you pick up the movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A Masterpiece.,"Monty Python takes a bit of getting used to, as their comedy company is somewhat of an acquired taste for most Americans who aren't accustomed to the dry British wit featured in these movies. However, they are absolute geniuses of comedy, as is demonstrated here in their first full-length feature film, ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail."" There are excellent and memorable lines, hilarious dialog, and intentionally cheesy acting, combined to give you the laugh of the Dark Ages.King Arthur and his lowest-budgeted knights set off on their legendary quest for the Holy Grail. What they find, instead, is series of mishaps, antics, and outright hilariously idiotic stumbling-blocks.I highly suggest seeing this on the Special Edition DVD (KILLER RABBIT-ON!). There are added features you will undoubtedly enjoy.""I...fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father...smelt...of...ELDERBERRIES ~!

worth the wait in gold,"Way too often when I ask people their favorite movies...one of these three flicks is offered.....Spaceballs...Shawshank Redemption or Monty Python and the Holy Grail.I've always considered these movies over- rated and thus avoided seeing them while simultaneously readjusting downward my opinion of the cinematic tastes of those recommending the flicks.I only avoided Shawshank for a few months. I've got to admit it was pretty good when I finally saw it and if I would have waited a few more months it probably would have been better and if I had waited a few years it probably would have been great. I waited twenty years to see Spaceballs and when it was finally forced upon me I watched it with an attempted open mind but kept comparing the flick unfavorably to other Brooks films like Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, High Anxiety, Silent Movie,and The Producers. I came away with the reinforced bias that Mel lost his touch after Silent Movie. I held out for almost thirty years on Monty Python. Then to my alarm my twelve year old daughter Mary told me that Monty Python was the funniest movie she had ever seen. I like Mary's taste and when I told her that I had never seen Holy Grail, she was surprised and encouraged me to rent the DVD which I did. I played it last night and yup, I loved it. Truly an original film. We laughed and now everybody is walking around going ""neeth"" etc. Of the three Grail is the best, Redemption second and Spaceballs a distant third.

Torture,First thing I want to ask is ... how can anyone give this an 8.4 rating !!!!! I watched this movie when I saw its rating. But sorry to say the movie was hopeless. There was no humour in this movie. The entire ambiance in the movie looked gloomy. The attempts at humours were pathetic and even a 4 year old kid would write better comic scenes. It was the most boring movie I have ever watched. What were these people thinking when they made this movie ? This definitely not the 'epitome' of English comedy. Only thing it was good at was that I had a nice nap when I was half way though the movie. The remaining half gave me a nice sleep in the night. Don't even bring its DVD on rent.If I had to describe this movie in one word it would be 'nonsense'. (I had a stronger word but I refrained myself from saying it),1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

While they were coming back from Camolot, God speaks to them and tells them to find the Holy Grail. Though trial and tribulation, 2 of the 5 made it to the location of the grail.

I hated this the first time too.,"I saw there were a couple people that watched this once and hated it. When I first watched it, I was about 17.  My younger brother was watching it and just cracking up.  I thought it was boring and never even bothered to watch all of it.  What is weird is that I even liked the flying circus and watched it all the time, but this movie was just, ""BLAH""A few years later I was in a remote area for a year (Yosemite National Park) and there was nothing to do at night except watch TV if you had one.  One night the local bar had a ""Locals Only"" party and the Holy Grail was the feature. ""DAMN, not that again"" I thought.  But I got there and everyone was hysterical and reciting the entire movie.  I think something I missed before finaly stuck and I realized what a great movie this was.  If you saw it once and hated it, find a bunch of friends that liked it, get a big party going and have a blast. That might show you what it is all about.  Although it is good when you are alone, it is soo much better with friends.Yes I do now own this on VHS along with other python movies but when I got a DVD player, this was the one I bought.

"""Is that an African swallow?""","I love this film and slightly prefer it to the Life of Brian (which is hilarious) I only saw this for the first time last year and was so glad i finally got to see it after many years of wanting to.The Pythons have such a unique style of comedy that at the time was groundbreaking, it's not as shocking or controversial by today's standards but the point is they weren't afraid to take risks or not do something for fear of looking stupid.Set in legendary King Arthur's England, King Arthur (played brilliantly by Graham Chapman) and his knights set upon a quest to find the holy grail. The quest takes them to the most ludicrous places (like the castle Anthrax) and they face the most bizarre situations (the bridge of death to name but one) and meet some peculiar characters including the Knights of Ni.The acting is great with Chapman as King Arthur and the other pythons playing many small roles, each very talented and individually skilled. There are many laughs, my favourite part being the conversation about the migrating swallows. I really enjoyed this film and think more young people should see it, it is one of the few films labelled as a comedy that actually makes me laugh.Although it is over thirty years old, it doesn't feel dated to me, it has a contemporary feel to it and i think it will still be popular in thirty years time. This is in my opinion the best film they have done; 'Life of Brian' is a close second but wasn't too impressed with 'the meaning of life'.Anyways a must see and deservedly in the top 250.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Hilarious and perfectly constructed,"Watching this for the first time in at least ten years, it became screamingly obvious to me which sections were directed by Terry Gilliam and which were directed by Terry Jones. Jones tends to set up his camera from afar, capturing all of the actors in a single shot and letting them perform. Gilliam pieces his parts together from many smaller parts, individually gathered with more interesting angles and compositions. They both have their charms, and they end up working really well as a whole because while the visual aesthetic may be different between the two directors, there's a common comedic approach that crosses that visual barrier and comes together as a whole and hilarious experience.While the experience is a whole, it's obviously built from smaller parts that stem from a group of comedians more in tune with the formula of sketch comedy. The intelligent approach was to use a story (the quest for the Holy Grail) which lent itself to branching off in a few different directions for a time, allowing isolated bits of comedy, before bringing it all back to one conclusion.The movie is largely broken into three sections. The first is Arthur building his team (which really only accounts for his finding of Bedivere, everyone else gets summarized). The second is the knights going off in different directions to look for the grail. The third brings them all back to finish out the adventure (with the group getting smaller by the second for different reasons).What makes the movie work, though, is the comedy. The comedy stems from the funny dialogue but also from the contrast between the serious look of the material against the inherent silliness of the comedy. Terry Gilliam called it ""laughing at castles"". They had to film very cheaply, and one of the cheapest ways to film is to simply go outside. Living in a country as verdant and richly foliaged as England, while also populated with castles that have stood there for hundreds of years. Just going there gave the film instant production values that they could never get close to replicated on sets. It's the contrast there that's the source of much of the comedy.Graham Chapman plays Arthur very seriously for most of the film, offering only scattered moments of befuddlement at the most ridiculous of circumstances. He's the straight man, and his reactions are mostly the source of his own comedy. Terry Jones plays Bedivere as a nebbish knight who should probably not be in armor while being very sure of his grasp of the most advanced scientific knowledge. John Cleese is Lancelot, a mindlessly brave hero who runs into every situation ready to deal with it using his sword. Michael Palin is Galahad, the purest of the pure. Eric Idle plays Sir Robin, the most cowardly of the cowards. The characters aren't deep. They're meant as personifications of specific types that the Pythons use to direct jokes at, and it works exceedingly well.I think it's most obvious in the middle section, when the knights split up, to see where the humor comes from. Robin the coward is faced with certain death. Galahad the pure is faced with certain temptation. Lancelot the brave is put in a situation where his bravery is wildly out of place. They're the sorts of adventures heroes defined by singular traits go on in straight adventure tales, but here everything's turned on their heads. Robin doesn't become brave, he remains cowardly, running away. Galahad decides that a little bit of temptation will be fine (only to be bravely saved by the brave Sir Lancelot at the last second). Lancelot is so blinded by his need for adventure that he murders half a wedding party to get to a waifish young prince who doesn't really need the rescuing he desires.It's the contrasts and the inherent silliness that makes the film. That extends even further to the presence of the French, everything animated, the knights who say Ni, and the movie's ending.Oh, the ending. I think it's perfect. In a movie built on setting expectations of a retelling of the Arthurian legend upside down, setting up a giant battle (with an army that appears out of nowhere) only to have it end with Arthur and Bedivere carried away in a modern police paddy wagon is great. It's the exact sort of undermining of expectations that the movie has embraced from beginning to that very end.So, it's a patchwork that is designed to work as a patchwork. It's tightly crafted humor at the hands of two surprisingly firm directorial hands (each in their first attempts) with varying styles that merge together really well. It's beautiful to look at, using the most out of their location shooting. It's fast at a quick 90 minutes, and it's consistently funny throughout. You don't need me to tell you, but this is a greatly crafted comedy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
What do you mean? African or European Swallow?,"Growing up, I probably watched this movie over 20 times with my friends. Though we didn't understand much of what was going on, we knew that it was hilarious. Now as an adult, I showed this movie to my 8-year-old son and he (like 8-year-old me) could not stop laughing.Between the coconut clacking Patsy, the black knight, the holy hand grenade and the Knights who say Ni, there is plenty to keep a kid entertained. As an adult, it was the jam-packed dialogue and hilarious banter that kept me laughing. The conversations regarding swallows, supreme executive power, hamsters and elderberries, and what makes a witch (among countless others), are why Monty Python and the Holy Grail is legendary.The scenes are memorable, the dialogue is endlessly quotable and the absurdity is top tier.Best Character: Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir Lancelot

Funniest Movie Ever. Period. End of Story.,"Few movies in the history of movies inspire its fans to memorize every scene, every bit of dialogue, every microscopic nuance to be brought out later at social gatherings. Such is Monty Python and the Holy Grail.The Pythoners once said in an interview that when they wrote their characters, their scripts, it was NEVER about what they thought would make millions of people laugh. It was about what made the six of THEM laugh, and that is a fitting testament to Python's genius.John Cleese once commented that the British are a people who are desperate to be made fun of. When many people think of England, the first images most people the world over conjure up are either the horrible weather or the stuffed shirts that make up the aristocracy. The best British comedies through the years. Python, Benny Hill and the Black Adder series, to name a few, were all made immortal because they railed against the stiff, boring world they grew up in by displaying the wacky irreverence that made even the status quo laugh.The Knights Who Say ""Nee!"" The French Taunter. The Castle Anthrax. The Rabbit. Lancelot's stint at Swamp Castle. ""Bring Out Your Dead."" The Bridge Keeper. You mention these things to people, and they instantly know what you mean, even if the name of the movie hasn't even come up! But even the smaller bits are worthy of remembrance: The Opening Credits. The Coconuts. The Witch Trial. Sir Robin's Minstrels. The old man clapping on the dungeon wall. The 10-second (PSYCH!) intermission. The Holy Hand Grenade. And the aptly named Sir-Not-Appearing-In-This-Film. The list goes on and on. Every second of this movie belongs in the Comedy Hall of Fame.I'd bet that his film is on more people's Top 10 Funniest Movies of All Time than any other. It has become a standard in the industry.""Strange women lying in ponds..."" ""Bet you're gay!"" ""No I'm not..."" ""I got better..."" ""...silly English Knnnnnnniggets"" ""Run Away! Run Away!""

My favourite comedy ever!,"What does it take a film to be immortalized? What moves audiences and critics alike to carve a special place in history for them? James Cameron would argue that it's innovation in special effects; Francis Ford Coppola and Peter Jackson would have you know it's the depth of a story and its epic development through trilogies; Orson Welles was quite sure it was a film's ability to perform above its time and deal with perennial topics. They would all be correct, and their respective films have triumphed and remain must-sees to the world at large. But what would be Monty Python's answer to the above questions? How would the members of this perfect English troupe deal with the pure genius of their films and the depth of their comedy? They'd stand by the fact that, um, a good deal of moose, coconut-carrying African swallows, cheeky revolutionary peasants, 'Ni'-saying knights, Broadway-style numbers and a famous historian are the key to a great, pitch-perfect comedy that stands the test of time...and you know what? Even through their silliness, they'd be correct.Monty Python is a group of English thespians composed of Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones and Michael Palin. Just to read their names together makes the reader raise his/her eyebrow in amusement, for their household names, synonyms of pure comedy. Monty Python gave England its laughs with their satirical, modern and outrageous humour reminiscent of Peter Cook, Harold Pinter and Samuel Beckett, and the few feature films they made together caused such uproar around the world that they're now considered utter classics by critics, film associations, cults, universities and families. ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"", possibly their most iconic film, is my personal favourite.The plot follows King Arthur, who has only just retrieved Excalibur from its stony perch and has been informed by the Lady of the Lake that he's to become the greatest king ever. He now travels through the entire country searching for brave, wise, gallant knights who'd like to join him at his round table at Camelot. Sounds quite epic and historical, doesn't it? Well, it's anything but. The film is hilariously nonsensical, too outrageous to be believed, silly at its core; it constantly strays from the plot to present different ridiculous sketches of the knights, it presents events that are not only unbelievable but preposterous...it is, in short, a farce of what comedies and epics have come to be. But unlike other silly movies like ""Scary Movie"", the film's parody is pure genius and manages to make heavy political, religious and cultural statements throughout, and the silliness is actually uproarious. I laugh every single minute of it, and younger audiences will find that, even if THEY'RE not doing so, the wit and intelligence underlying the ridiculous events astonish them. Audiences of every age and generation have found this to be a comic gem to be treasured.The film begins with THE wittiest opening credits I've seen to date. They're shown upon a black screen featuring ominous, dramatic music and Swedish subtitles. Through the course of the credits roll, the subtitles no longer translate what is being written in English but give out the weirdest, most non-sensical statements about moose; soon after the credits stop and a disclaimer announces that those responsible for the stupid subtitles have been sacked. The subtitles resume, and once again the disclaimer appears saying that those responsible for sacking have been sacked too. More credits appear, like ""Moose special effects,"" ""Moose trainers,"" ""Miss Avery's moose"", ""No moose have been harmed in the making of this film,"" etc...to the point where a third disclaimer appears saying that everyone responsible for the credits has been sacked and a new set of people have been quickly rounded up to finish the credit sequence, which grows sillier and sillier to the very end. The opening credits foretell the silliness of the film aptly, for the remaining hour and forty minutes is a wild and crazy romp that will have you in awe. Never (and I mean NEVER) has a film been simultaneously silly and profound like this.I can't name any particular scene to exemplify the film's genius. I rather have the reader rent or buy the film and be treated to its wonder without any warning of the surprises in store. There's epic fight scenes, outrageous musical numbers, heavy parody, controversial political and religious statements, interwoven modern scenes, some animation and, well, just about the best screen writing and acting I've ever seen. So...What DOES it take for a film to be immortalized? The answer is pure and simple: it needs to be the inspired work of geniuses, and Monty Python lives up to those standards.Please, if you know what's best for you, SEE THIS FILM!

Requires abit of intelligence,"This movie is hilarious yet the comedy is the type that requires a person has a fair bit of intelligence to understand what exactly the joke is.

Stick to the simple comedy that requires no thinking.

Nearly Dead Already,"I was smack in the center of the target demographic for this film 25 years ago. I thought it was liberated, sacrilegious, self-referential, anarchic, all the things we liked.Seeing it now, only a few parts are funny. I suspect they are all written by Cleese: the bit about swallows and coconuts, the two episodes with the French guard, and the skit concerning anarchy. These are precious.The rest is getting worse with each passing day. The problem is that so much of their humor depended on being outrageously, either with the unexpected or the taboo.

"High, No Low, No High, No Low, Comedy","Let me see. How does one respond to this. There are sight gags galore. The king pretends to ride a horse, while coconut shells are struck together to simulate hoofbeats. This is just the start. Soon an involved discussion about a swallow's ability to transport the said shells ensues. The Pythons then work their ways through the countryside, searching for the Holy Grail. Like most knights, they fall victim at times to temptation. They are also beset on by cows fired from catapults and a man-eating rabbit. they more I write, the more stupid it all sounds.

Of curse, there are also contemporary non-sequiters, including the movie's ending. This is without a doubt one of the silliest movies ever made. Don't ask me to explain it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Still a classic to this day!!,"The only sad thing about The Holy Grail is that they didn't make another one! Sadly, I see that there are many reviews that are 1 star. I just don't get it. Or maybe, they didn't get it. Several reviews remarked that ""it looked cheap"", or it was ""silly"", and that there was ""poor acting"". The only thing I can figure is that these reviewers must be under the age of 13, or at least have the IQ of someone under thirteen. You do need to have studied a bit of English history or at least watched one of the many King Arthur movies made in the past 50 years. Do high school kids read the Canterbury Tales anymore? But if you're under 12 or limit your movie watching to ""kick in the crotch"" comedy, this might be a little over your head. What are kids learning about in History nowadays? I only ask because neither my 17 year old nephew or any of his friends found this movie funny. They just stared at it like they didn't understand WHY it was funny! Maybe the dumbing down of our education system is really happening after all. Anyway, if you know anything about the story of King Arthur then you will find this movie extremely funny!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

The Thin Line Between Stupid and Genius,"Monty Python and the Holy Grail shows to us how thin is the line that divides a movie from being stupid and being genius and a landmark of comedy genre. Even though conservative critics might rather rate negatively a movie featuring coconuts instead of horses, the standard movie-lover will find this as a hilarious chill out.I haven't watched the other Monty Python movies, but no film I have seen compares to this. Scary Movies may come to mind, but not even the first two are comparable to Monty Python's language and situation gags.The story is basically that of King Arthur and three of the knights of the round table going through numerous adventures as they seek for the cup from which Jesus drank on the Last Supper.It is to jot down that this movie contains a lot of language and British humor, which may not be suitable to the audience which finds laughter on stupid falls or hits in the head or other parts.As a conclusion, I think that although you do not end up liking the movie, you still would appreciate to have seen how a movie with low budget is exactly done.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

The best Monty Python film.,"Monty Python and the Holy Grail tells the story of King Arthur and his knights of the round table as they head out on a quest to find the Holy Grail. This is based on a real Arthurian legend, but made hilariously absurd by the Monty Python group. This is Monty Python's best film because it is non stop funny, and its twist on the legend of King Arthur makes a great base for a film.The reason I find Monty Python funny is because their humour is so random, and so absurd, that you can't help but laugh at how ridiculous and how stupid some of it is. What I like about this film in particular, is that it can't even make it through the opening credits without goofing off with subtitles at the bottom of the screen. Then, as the movie actually starts, it manages to look like a serious King Arthur film for all of five seconds before we notice that King Arthur is not riding a horse, but he's skipping along as a lackey behind him clacks too coconuts together making the sound of hooves. Then, the verbal humour starts. This movie has some truly hilarious characters that will make you fall to the floor laughing. There's Sir Robin, the Not-Quite-As-Brave-As-Sir-Lancelot, who everyone thinks is the bravest of all the knights when in fact, he's afraid of the smallest of things. Then there's the Knights Who Say NI, a group of knights that scare all who see them by screaming the word NI over and over. Possibly the funniest scene in the movie is where the knights of the round table are attacked by the fiercest monster in all the world...A fluffy white bunny.What makes the movie even better is that it was made on a very small budget, so in some scenes, animation has to take over because they just couldn't afford to do the scene in live action, but they manage to cover this up by making the animation scenes absolutely hilarious. The Monty Python group are true comic geniuses, and this is their best work. I recommend this movie to everyone that likes a good laugh.8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
The Magnificent Quest for the Holy Grail,"Many people enjoy the most hilarious movie of all time, Monty Python and the Holy Grail. The directors (Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones), did a great job directing this movie and putting things all together. The things that really put the movie in the top of the charts is the content, actors, and the special effects and animation put into the movie. Everybody loves the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail.First of all, what makes this movie spectacular is the content of the movie itself. The directors and the writers of the movie really put a lot of time and effort to make sure that this movie is the best of the best. This movie starts off with King Arthur, King of the Britons, on a quest to search for knights to join him in his quest for Camelot. After that, once King Arthur has found his loyal knights they found Camelot. However, besides staying in Camelot, which they decide not to do with literally a song and a dance, they are talked to by God. God tells them that they are now on a quest for the Holy Grail, a chalice used by Christ at the Last Supper. This, the knights are now off on an asinine mission to find the hidden Holy Grail. His story is the best that it could for a movie that is a comedy.Furthermore, the second stupendous thing about this movie is the actors that play the roles in this whimsical movie. The actors in the movie: Graham Chapman, John Clesse, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, Michael Pain, etc., do a fantastic job in the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail. One unbelievable thing that astonishes me is that all of the actors have a abounding amount of roles to play in the movie. There is one example when the actor Graham Chapman (King Arthur, Voice of God, Middle Head, and Hiccoughing Guard) had a scene where he is talking to himself. To demonstrate, Graham starts out as God saying, ""What are you doing now?"" and then Graham comes in again as King Arthur and says, ""Averting our eyes, oh Lord."" Accordingly, God says back to him again and says, ""Well, don't. It's just like those miserable psalms, always so depressing. Now knock it off!"" This is just one of the plentiful examples how Monty Python and the Holy Grail is the most preeminent movie of all of history.Conversely, some people may not agree with me on the matter. Some people would even go even to a ridiculous accusation that the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail is deficient. Well I am here to tell you otherwise. I am just pointing out that the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail has gotten many incredibly amazing reviews by critics and also that it received a 95% from the critics running the rating website ""Rotten Tomatoes"". The Monty Python and the Holy Grail is and will continue to be the most unsurpassed comedy forever.Moreover, the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a prevailing movie because of the special effects and the animation incorporated into certain parts of the movie. The directors of the movie knew exactly when to use the skill of animation to make the movie more interesting without making you think that it complete animation. It is also extremely well written because the directors and movie editors give a nice twist in style of the movie by adding the animations in the different parts of the movie. There is one part of the animation scenes that I believe to very clever; it was a very eye-catching part of the movie. It was when the knights are being chased by the animated monster in the cave and the way they made it go away is by saying that the animator had a fatal heart attack was very clever idea. This is just one of the many examples on how the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail is the best comedy ever made.There are many reasons for everybody to go out and see the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Some of the copious reasons to go see the movie include the content, actors, and the special effects and animation put into the movie. If you you are a comedy lover or a Monty Python fan then I encourage you to go and see this movie. If you are not one of these people and are somebody that thinks that the Monty Python is intolerable or you are just someone who dislikes comedy I embolden you to go and see the Month Python and the Holy Grail.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

"""What, behind the rabbit?""","The second feature film vehicle for the legendary Monty Python comedy troupe wasn't always terribly funny for this viewer, but it has enough memorably hilarious lines and moments to make it very pleasant viewing. The boys are in their element here, knowing full well that often the best ""no-brainer"" laughs actually require a fair amount of intelligence. Along the way there are many verbal and visual gags, some of which go on a bit long. But there's always another good laugh in store. The movie is deliberately episodic, giving each main character a chance in the spotlight, and allowing each troupe member to show off his comedic chops. There are some delicious jokes that remind you that you're watching a movie, including the time honoured tradition of breaking the fourth wall. There are hysterically over the top gore gags, animated interludes, and the occasional brief musical bit.The story has King Arthur (Graham Chapman) recruiting good men to be part of the court of Camelot, among them Sir Bedevere (Terry Jones), Sir Galahad the Pure (Michael Palin), Sir Lancelot the Brave (John Cleese), and Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir-Lancelot (Eric Idle). God then tasks Arthur and his merry band with retrieving the Holy Grail, causing them to have many misadventures as they deal with countless quirky individuals, such as the Knights Who Say NI!Among the personal favourite moments for this viewer were the goofy and gruesome fight with the Black Knight (Cleese), the instances of taunting from French soldiers (""Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!""), the episode with the fair maidens of Castle Anthrax, and of course the show stopping confrontation with one of the most deadly beasts known to man. Adding to the entertainment factor is the use of music, which is majestic rather than comical.The ending to this is uproarious, and does send the audience away with a smile. All in all, ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" is engaging stuff that is preferable to some of the comedies of the modern era.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

'Holy Grail' on the other hand pushed the limits for silliness too far that it was not at all funny. ...............

King Arthur and his knights from a whole other side.,"There's a new form of testing our English skills at our school. It's a watch and listen-test. You get to see an English documentary or something (no subtitles of course!) and you have to answer question about what you see and hear. My English teacher had the most brilliant plan to practise for one of these tests: We were going to watch The Holy Grail. The reactions were different. A few got a grin on their face, that didn't go away until the film was ended. Others looked bored or annoyed. Monty Python's humour is really particular. I myself was one of the smiling kids: I enjoyed it from the ""wrong subtitles"" at the beginning, until the last step of Arthur and his brave knights. Most people had never seen the film before and were immediately bored when the coconut-conversation came up. As I said, the humour is typical, but it's totally my kind of humour. The film is so ridiculous (think about flesh eating rabbits, never ending conversations about coconuts and a knight, who still lives and wants to fight after he got his arms and legs cut off) it's just very very very funny. I especially love the Brave Sir Robin song and the witch trial. Anyway, when I came out of the classroom (still grinning of course) I had the feeling this was the best class I ever had.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

An Origin of Comedy,"A revelation of comedy in the 20th century was of course the surge of Monty Python and its inexplicable style of comedy in the most chaotic, primitive of manners to hit the height of legendary status and still be appreciated in the modern world today.A comedic send-up of the grim circumstances of the Middle Ages as told through the story of King Arthur and framed by a modern-day murder investigation. When the mythical king of the Britons leads his knights on a quest for the Holy Grail, they face a wide array of horrors, including a persistent Black Knight, a three-headed giant, a cadre of shrubbery-challenged knights, the perilous Castle Anthrax, a killer rabbit, a house of virgins, and a handful of rude Frenchmen.John Cleese is the star of what very much seems like a show, intricate comedic sketches compiled into 90 minutes. The English actor encapsulates the enthusiasm of his role and provided his audience with memorable moments of genius. The film is naturally a comedy with a fantastical premise medieval Britain in a much more diluted version of Vikings and war. This design and unrivalled format is the reason to why The Holy Grail lives on 46 years later, its sophisticated yet animated picture makes for excellent viewing as well as the fun that the actors share on screen.There is no doubt that Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones' production is very much a Holy Grail and when Led Zeppelin, Genesis and Pink Floyd all helped out budget the film, sometimes I do think... man, I wish I was there (when the film was first released).",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

'Tis But A Masterpiece,"Monty Python And The Holy Grail is one of the few comedies that are funny before it even starts. Starting in the opening credits there are already several jokes that clearly show the purpose of the film, to make you laugh. The film is very successful at doing this as it has you laughing from beginning to end. The members of Monty Python are considered by many to be some of the best comedians ever and this film is an excellent of why. Monty Python And The Holy Grail is an amazing comedy that is still hilarious 44 years after its release making it a comedy masterpiece.
Monty Python And The Holy Grail is about King Arthur and several knights who go on a quest to find the holy grail. At first King Arthur builds a group of knights for his holy quest. On their hilarious quest they run into several foes such as the French, a deadly rabbit, the bridge of death and several more. All along their quest they will have you laughing at all the comedic conversations and battles.
Arthur, King of the Britons (Graham Chapman) is a king who leads his knights on a quest for the holy grail. His fellow knights Sir Lancelot the Brave (John Cleese), Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir-Lancelot (Eric Idle), Sir Bedevere the Wise (Terry Jones) and Sir Galahad the Pure (Michael Palin) help Arthur defeat (or run away from) many foes on their quest for the grail. The members of the cast work really well together to make this film a work of art that keeps you laughing until the very end. The film is directed by Gilliam and Jones who proved that they can make an amazing film stand the test of time.
The film is an amazing example of how to use music and sound to add humor or intensity to a scene. The costumes and film locations really make the film feel like it takes place in 10th century England. The music before an action scene always fits well with the story. The sound effects, like the use of coconuts to make the sound of a horse, find a way to add humor to every scene. The script is a big reason the film is as good as it is because it is humorous and tells the story wonderfully. The camerawork and effects work seamlessly to make hilarious action scenes that look pretty real.
One scene that exemplifies why Monty Python And The Holy Grail is an amazing film is the ""Deadly Rabbit of Caerbannog"" scene. In this scene good camera work and effects make the battle between the knights and the bunny intense. This is compounded by the sound effects of the bunny's attacks to make the bunny a surprisingly scary foe. At the same time the dialogue between the characters makes a bloody action scene more into a comedy. This scene is a work of art because it is both an intense action scene and hilarious at the same time.
Monty Python And The Holy Grail isn't a perfect film though. It's biggest flaw is the fact that it is over 40 years old. The age definitely shows with the lack of modern special effects and low camera quality. If you like to watch films because of their jaw-dropping special effects and super high definition video then this film isn't for you. However, if you can get over the films obvious age then you will enjoy the comedic masterpiece that is Monty Python And The Holy Grail.
The Monty Python group has made many more films and television broadcasts than just Monty Python And The Holy Grail. Monty Python is a british comedy group that made it big with the BBC series Monty Python's Flying Circus. This series is much different work than the film Monty Python And The Holy Grail because it's a TV series spanning forty five episodes instead of a 92 minute film. The change in format however made little difference in Monty Python's ability to make amazing comedies as after their BBC series ended they made several great films.
With Monty Python's work in films like Monty Python And The Holy Grail they have cemented themselves as one of the most influential comedy groups. Graham Chapman's stellar performance as King Arthur alongside the rest of the cast drives the film forward while the great sound and visual effects take care of the rest. Everything in Monty Python And The Holy Grail fits together perfectly to make the film a real comedy masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

I thought I was watching a different movie!,"This is a silly comedy starring the Monty Python troop, where they play King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, embarking on a journey in search of the Holy Grail while encountering silly obstacles.At first, I thought I was watching a different movie, but the gag during the opening credits really caught me by surprise and sent me laughing out loud, very eager to know what the movie holds.The plot starts out slow from the beginning but slowly picks up steam as the movie approaches the middle, from the King and his Knights' Holy Grail search to the comical bloody sword fights and funny witch hunts. There are a smack of slapstick comedy here and there, but it is the dialog and human interaction that will make you chuckle. You also need to suspend reality and let your imagination run wild to enjoy the film.The special effects, how ever low budget they were, were done pretty well; the cinematography and color were also good; and the acting was OK - a little wooden at times. It was nice to see John Cleese in it - the only actor I recognize in the movie.Overall, it is a worthy comedy. I've seen funnier things, though.

Funny in a British Way,"I think that Monty Python is very amusing. This movie in particular is a triumph of the particular style that has kept Python famous for decades. The ending is a bit pathetic (but origional) and there are a couple sequences that are basically filler but when combined with the Black Knight Sequence, the Dead Cart scene, the whole swallows/coconuts thing and the amusing credits, this movie is great. I personally think it is a worthwhile film because the average movie budget in the UK is sixpence and the entire continent has only four fields of culture: 1)Douglas Adams (Deceased :( ) 2)Terry Pratchett 3)Monty Python 4)Ozzy OsbourneWorking in these conditions makes The Holy Grail a  Masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Too good.,"I have had the privilege to see this film upwards of 200 times, and every single time, it somehow gets funnier. Not my all-time favourite film, but CERTAINLY my favourite comedy, this film heads the list (along with Animal House, There's Something About Mary, Dumb and Dumber, and Ghostbusters) as being, single-handedly, the most quotable movie ever created. I viewed a comment from another person stating you they didn't like this film, along with Caddyshack and another classic film whose name I can't remember. Yea, buddy, you are a part of a SMAAAAAAALL minority. Out of the thousand people I know, 2 of them ""somewhat dislike"" this movie, and I assure you it is because they never gave it a chance. Now, I am not pointing fingers that people who don't like it have no sense of humour...but it's making me think...What this film does is it tears-apart the King Arthur legend with such dry wit and scathing (but mostly clean) British humour, that it takes a leap above any comedy ever produced (although it is unbelievably low-budget). Sure, it's bloody, but FAKE BLOODY. This right away makes it hilarious. Complete with plenty of hilarious ""Gillianimation,"" an enchanter named ""Tim,"" Knights who say ""Nee!"", and a cute-but-deadly killer rabbit, this film is anything but normal and nothing but hilarious. I don't care WHO you are; you laugh at something. This here is one comedy that is nothing like any else...that pushes the envelope in a time when it was unheard...that is a vacation from normality and for 2 hours allows the viewer to believe, ""Hey, it's okay to be weird."" See this, for it truly is a classic.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
The silliest of Python movies,"Holy Grail is easily the silliest of all the Python movies, save And Now For Something Completely Different which isn't really a movie at all but a series of some of the better sketches from the Flying Circus. Of course saying that Holy Grail is silly certainly isn't insulting it in any way, it may be the funniest Python movie ever made, although the humor isn't for everyone. The pure randomness and all out impossibility of everything that happens is what makes it so funny, this is definatly present in their other films but generally not to the degree that is seen in Holy Grail. I have a hard time deciding whether Holy Grail or Life of Brian is the better movie, while Holy Grail tends to get more overall laughs, Life of Brian's jokes seem more intelligent and well thought out. I would say that Holy Grail is better for a first time viewing, but Life of Brian tends to be funnier over repeat viewings.  Both movies are simply fantastic and nothing made nowadays can come close to rivaling the all out hillarity that was Python.I don't know how you people can not like the ending to Holy Grail, in my oppinion it fit in so perfectly with the rest of the movie. You guys love other odd quips of the same sort such as the holy hand grenade, the animator suddenly dying to kill off a monster, the black knight and cocconuts being used in place of horses yet a completely random and unexpected ending doesn't sit right with you? That just seems strange to me. Personally, I think having a big budget, flashy fight scene at the end would've made the movie seem stale and unoriginal, it simply wouldn't fall in with the style of the rest of the film. They needed to put in something that would make audiences say ""What the hell was that all about?"" at the end at that's exactly what they did.While the members of Python have now gone their seperate ways you can still see the same type of wackiness coming up in newer movies they've contributed to. I would say the most prominant would be the films Terry Gilliam has directed, most of them aren't meant to be funny but the aching attention to detail he puts into his strange, chaotic sets will often remind you of something out of Python. The best examples would be Brazil and to a lesser extent Twelve Monkeys, both strange, fantastic movies, even though they're not particularly funny.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
a classic,"Monty Python, famous British acting troupe, does good. If you like irreverent humor, The Flying Circus series, or any of the single actors, you will LOVE this movie. We own it. There was no question of whether to buy it. We have the DVD collection which has quite a bit of the movie's history included. We enjoy the extras almost as much as the movie itself. The plot was hilarious, the comic timing incredible, and the direction stunningly fabulous. My son (12) loves the movie. We skip over a certain part, where Sir Galahad has his little adventure, for my son. Other than that, it's pretty ""clean"" as far as Monty Python goes. Go over the list of actors and you'll see just how low-budget this film was. And for all that, it still is an incredible movie. If you like this one, check out The Life of Brian and The Meaning of Life. (Make sure you read the summaries first. These are more irreverent to my way of thinking and my son has not seen them yet.)

Funny Monty Python Style,"Monty Python has been known for doing comedy in their own style and this one is no exception.

From ""the knights who say NI"" to the ""killer rabbit"" and to the silly animations that's typical for this comedy group. It can sometimes get tiresome because there is NON-STOP comedy in this, but still there are some jokes that are forever to be stuck in your head!

It is a silly slapstick type of humor, but words do not express what the movie is like. It is an experience on must have for themself. Whether or not you will enjoy its a whole different story because Monty Python is an acquired taste, where it is either loved or hated by the viewer, there is almost no middle ground.

English comedy classic,"Surely this film is overrated in that it's been tagged with 'greatness' as one of John Cleese and the gang's most prominent works.

This is the inside humor of a bunch of guys who love to make sketches, and they make a movie. Hopefully, you're on their side and get the humor either from a cultural pov (you are British/Irish) or you fancy it because it's such an 'essential' comedy that sticks out.

The film does have a few dud gags, in particular the tale of Sir Lancelot, but these are far outnumbered by the good (""Allo daffy English Kniggits and Messeur Arthur King who has the brain of a duck you know!""). Despite its self-deprecating tagline, this film feels like an epic, especially since it was made for less than the cost to cater a modern Hollywood film, and is beautifully shot. Perhaps the most innocent and sweet-natured of the Python's films, it still features a liberal amount of sensless murder and bleakness, particularly near the beginning and end. It is still the most addictive of their films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
The Holy Grail of comedy,"If you're a fan of 'Python' you'll love this (in fact you'll probably already have watched and enjoyed it). If you don't like Python, but consider yourself to be a generally humorous person then you should watch it, too. Only people with absolutely no sense of humour should steer clear of this.It (loosely) follows Graham Chapman as King Arthur as he's charged (by none other than God himself) with his holy task of locating the Holy Grail. To help him he's aided in typical style by the rest of the Pythons, cunningly disguised as various Knights (not to mention practically everyone else they meet).And it's funny. That's the bottom line. I know it does look a little on the cheap side (the film was partially-funded by the band Pink Floyd if you're interested). But don't let the cheapness of the production put you off. I find that it's part of its charm. In fact, seeing blatantly false limbs severed in ridiculous amounts of fake blood.Yes, it's kind of 'off-the-wall' humour that you should already know comes with the Pythons. If you haven't seen it and like comedy, do give it a watch. It's probably also good to watch with friends. Seriously they don't make 'em like they used to. Awesome.

Best Comedy Ever (Including the ending),Almost everyone seems to like this movie but very few people enjoy the ending. I thought it was a great ending that fits right in with how the Python's did most of their sketches on the show......no real ending. How else would they end it....a big fight scene and a happy ending? That's not a good ending either and it's not a Python ending.,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Pure comic genius!!!,"The first time I saw Monty Python and the Holy Grail was in fifth grade, the last day my class was learning about the middle ages, and this was before I ever knew what Monty Python really was. This is a classic comedy! Probably one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen! It's definitely one of my favorites, the humor is rather crazy (Then again, Monty Python humor is very silly), but it's ingenious and I loved it! The six actors were really good, (not to mention they played most of the roles in this movie), and the entire story was simply a satire of King Arthur's Quest and the middle ages in general. I liked the killer rabbit, the ""obviously"" fake visual effects (throwing a stuffed rabbit at an actors head, blood looking like orange juice etc.) and their idea of pretending to ride horses and the use of coconuts. If you like British humor, then you will probably like this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Pure comedy. A couple of  spoilers but only scratches the surface of a classic.,"I think the best way to sum up this film is the advertisement: ""Makes Ben Hur look like an Epic"". The problem is that 'Ben Hur' is an Epic. But you'll scratch your head wondering if 'Ben Hur' is actually an Epic. Of course, it is one of the Epics of the 20th Century.Confusing, but watch 'Monty Pyton and The Holy Grail' and you'll be entertained. The King of England (in the dangerous times of the Dark Ages) is called Arthur and his Knights (carefully selected by him) are charged by God to search for the Holy Grail. Of course, they never actually find The Grail, and they never were going to find The Grail in the first place. That is the beauty of the film. I think maybe they suggested that a film has to have a plot to succeed, and they made a mockery of that. You don't have to. Or maybe the French got there first.I like the scene when John Cleese, acting as Sir Lancelot, attacks Swamp Castle. Beforehand, he reads a note from (what he thinks to be) a fair maiden being trapped into an enforced marriage. So he goes to save her. He massacres everyone in sight.Another good bit is when Sir Robin has to stop his minstrels singing about how brave he is and how he wouldn't mind suffering a horrible death confronting enemies, and he's probably thinking 'I'm not that brave'.Anyway, only two classic examples out of the whole film. Enjoy.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"Fortunately for me this was a rather short visit to the surreal land of Monty Python, and though it does have it's moments, I was really quite unimpressed by their Arthurian antics. We start with Graham Chapman's King Arthur gadding about England tying to recruit some suitably worthy individuals to sit at his round table. Task complete, he gets a sign from God that they must undertake the most holy of quests - and find the Cup of Christ. It now falls to the other three - Cleese, Idle and Gilliam - to dress up in suits of armour and seek the grail amongst the innuendo-ridden kingdom. Along the way they encounter the Black Knight, a castle full of sex-starved maidens, some monks - indeed just about everyone you might expect from mediaeval society before a really annoying denouement with the ""Knights of Ni"" - all they want is a little garden, or two... All but fifty years on, it's probably not really fair to look at this with 2024 eyes, but this was my first time of seeing it and I was really left thinking - why didn't the police get involved earlier? It's not that the jokes don't work, well not all of them, anyway - it's that they so labour the punchline. It's as if someone took a thirty minute sketch show and decided to pad it out for an extra hour. Less could certainly have been more. There are a few fun cameos - Carol Cleveland's ""Zoot"" and Connie Booth's witch stand out, but otherwise I felt a bit like I was the victim of some very dated hype. I didn't hate it, but really - what was all the fuss about?",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
So weird but so hilarious,"This is one of the best, but most bizarre comedies you'll ever see. The Monty Python team take you back 900 years to ancient Britain. We embark on a quest with King Arthur and his Knights to find the legendary Holy Grail. What follows is a hilarious adventure involving spoilt stuck-up princes, gory sword fights, wild untamed monsters and shrubberies.Is the plot the most complicated and thought provoking you'll ever see? No. Do the special effects blow you away? No. Could a dead fly have written a better plot line? Yes. So you're probably thinking, why am I giving this ten stars after typing all that? It's because the special effects are low-budget because they're meant to be - I mean, they could have used at least one horse. But it wouldn't be as funny if they did. The plot is so bizarre and ridiculous because if it wasn't, it wouldn't make Monty Python and The Holy Grail the masterpiece it is today. Not many British films get so much attention as this one.

Bloody Awful!,"I just don't get it. I'm a hard core Fawlty Towers fan and a Brit, but I find nothing funny about this film. The  rabbit scene near the end of the movie was the only thing that made me chuckle.Michael Palin was wonderful in his travel documentaries ""Around the World in 80 Days"" and ""Pole to Pole"", and John Cleese was perfect as Basil Fawlty, but put these two in a Monty Python film and you get no return on the investment. I have a wicked sense of humour and I have tried and tried to find something funny in all of the Python films, but I have yet to have a real good laugh.I wonder sometimes if there's an ""emperor's clothes"" type of mentality surrounding these movies; I'll pretend to like it so as I'll belong to the ""I get it club"". The humour in this movie is not intelligent - I work as a high school teacher and I am certain that the ""knuckle head"" students in my class would completely enjoy this film. Sure, the movie is full of jokes with historical relevance: feudalism, pre-enlightenment science, etc., but these don't make for an ""intelligent"" film - simple childish humour. In the same way as I don't find junior high school toilet jokes funny anymore, I think I have left it too late to appreciate the humour of the Holy Grail.I rented this movie completely on the recommendations of the user's comments on this site - a complete waste of money. Your $3.50 would be better spent on some Fawlty Towers re-runs.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A fun and silly comedy,"Monty Python and the Holy Grail is one of the most loved and famous comedy titles of all time. It is very funny with a pretty strange sense of humor. One of the earliest jokes in the movie was in the beginning credits with the moose in the captions. That was pretty funny. Then they said that llamas made the movie, which also made me laugh. Then in the beginning of the movie when a man and King Authur are talking about sparrows and coconuts, the man says ""Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?"", which cracked me up. Then in the scene with the dead people, one of the conversations was: Man 1: How do you know he's a king? Man 2: Because he hasn't got s*** all over him. (Keep in mind, these were poor villagers talking.)That was also hilarious. There were many, many more strange and funny moments in this movie. Some were the Black Knight, The cartoon monster, the taunting French men, and many many more.However, many jokes were flawed. Some jokes weren't clever, but just very silly. Others had a very long build-up for a joke that wasn't even very funny to begin with. Then, they repeat some jokes. For example, the ""No he's not dead yet, Oh no! He died!"" joke, was heard three times.Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a funny movie, but those with a different sense of humor may enjoy it more.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Brilliance,"Where to begin...Like Elvis and the Beatles, this film set the precedence for comedy in so many ways. Y'know, in some ways, it may have been ahead of its time (which is a comment toward the casts comedic brilliance). I say this because not a heck of a lot of movies are funny anymore. Anyway, back to the flick at hand... It takes vast intelligence to intermix silliness and intellect, the way Monty Python has. You watch the thing, know that it's ridiculous, but at the same time understand how much intelligence it took to pull it off. Some of the jokes are so deep, you need to cross reference an encyclopedia to get them. Besides that, their parody acting is unmatched. Completely believable - which is, of course what makes it so funny. Thanks Monty Python!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Fun start to Finish,"In this modern world of bad movies we have several hundred classics which made it through that are worth remembering. This is one of those films. A+ Film for ladies who want to understand their man. Boys love this film.

From the start it's a scene by scene extravaganza of gags, sketches and coconuts that will leave even the most hardened heart warmed with British Cheekiness. As many of you know Monty Pythons Flying Circus was a big British hit in the late 60's and early 70's before the Python troupe made their trip into film. This is their first attempt, Holy Grail and it's their best. There's not a man upon this planet who should die without knowing of Roger the Shrubber and the Knights who say Knee. There are some questionable moral dilemmas placed before Arthur and his Knights on their quest for the Grail. All in all, one of the best films to come out of the mid 70's and one of the most influential comedies of all time.

"""Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelt of elderberries.""","Oh, boy. Here we go again. What is it with films that are so beloved and well-liked ending up being the complete opposite for me? This film was practically a waste of time. You can tell that its purpose is to make you nearly die from laughter because of how outrageous and silly it is, and it couldn't even succeed at accomplishing a simple task like that.I almost feel like persecution is bound to come my way for the rest of eternity for thinking that this film was hardly funny, let alone hilarious: and overrated, and that it was a waste of time. Of course, that's hyperbole, but probably not false. This film has over 530,000 votes on IMDb, and its average rating is 8.2/10. That's ridiculous. I've probably broken the law by having this opinion; I could get arrested. Will I have to become a hermit, secluded from civilization? They'll come for me.Exaggerations aside, it's true that this film didn't strike me as that likable. It seemed borderline stupid most of the time. Not in a good way, of course. I didn't find it to be that entertaining.Overall, I was almost bored. But there was a bright spot or two. I thought the individual stories of Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-As-Sir-Lancelot, Galahad the Pure, and Lancelot the Brave were good. I only laughed during the one with the latter, the whole scene with making sure the Prince doesn't leave the room; that's the only time I laughed at the film. The other individual stories were good, though.On top of that, I thought doing the closing credits at the beginning was a surprising gag. That was the first time I'd seen that one. And I'll give credit where credit is due regarding that. But as far as the main twist is concerned (and to my surprise, its reveal was earlier than I was expecting) didn't have the impact intended for it to have.When this film was released, that sort of thing was probably unheard-of. Not anymore. And I've already watched Blazing Saddles, so that novelty is gone. Wow, what a twist. Yay. Who cares. I probably wouldn't either way.At first, my initial intention was to give this film a 7/10 rating simply because of those elements. But I changed my mind. This film, as a whole, was too underwhelming. Those elements don't come close to making it a 7/10. I appreciate them, of course; otherwise, this film would've been even worse. The entirety matters more: and it didn't deliver.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A Mixed Bag of Geeky Splendors,"There is no plot, it basically functions as a low-budget spoof of Le Morte D'Arthur. Some of the gags are funny some are not, but this is undeniably the best thing Monty Python ever produced.Best gags:The Black Knight is extremely funny and iconic for good reason.
The bridge scene is clever and hilarious.
The Camelot song is stupid but it will make you laugh and it is funny to watch.
The killer rabbit scene is so ridiculous it can't help but be funny.
The encounter with the cartoon monster is a good 4th wall break.
The witch trial is pretty funny.
The insulting French knight is an accurate spoof of French knights.
The Knights who say 'Ni' are funny out of sheer stupidity.Worst gags:There were some scenes that went on that just weren't funny at all.

The actors in this film are fantastic as many of them are forced to play many different roles. The stand-out performance in this is Graham Chapman.

A Python Laugh Riot-9.5/10 stars:,"I was at an open house and I got bored so I was invited to watch TV in the house. They had Netflix, so I skimmed through the menus for a movie. Searching through ""Classics"" I found Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I hadn't seen it in maybe 5 years, so I put it on. And it's funnier now than it was before!Holy Grail is the first of 3 Monty Python movies(The latter ones being The Life of Brian and The Meaning of Life), and it follows King Arthur and his men on a quest from God to seek the Holy Grail, the cup Jesus drank from at the Last Supper. However, their divine quest has many bumps on the way, but they won't give up until the cup is found!This is considered to be one of the greatest comedies ever made, and rightfully so. There are many scenes that are not only hilarious but also quite iconic. Take a scene where a random woman is falsely accused of being a witch and setenced to burning at the stake. Or a scene where a knight is dismemebered with a sword and attempts to fight back with his arms and legs missing. And then there is arguably the most famous scene, in which Arthur and his men are taunted by John Cleese as a French Man.The jokes come from left and right and many land, though some pass by if you are not so keen on the Medieval Era jokes. I also found that the first few jokes did not work for me-like a subtitle joke in the opening credits. This is why I gave the movie a 9.5 and not a 10. Even still, Holy Grail is a laugh riot that is sure to pick up a lower mood.Aside from the funny scenes, Holy Grail contains some iconic quotes as well, ones like: "" 'Tis just a flesh wound!"", ""Bring out your dead!"", ""Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of Elderberries!"", the list could go on. These quotes and aforementioned scenes show how this movie has affected culture just 45 years later.In fact, if you have seen the Christian animated series Veggie Tales, you can see how this movie has influenced the show. This is because the creator, Phil Vischer, considers this to be one of favorite movies of all time. In his first video: Where's God When I'm S-Scared, there is a reference to the ""Not the curtains lad"" scene from this movie. And in Josh and the Big Wall, the French Man scene is parodied throughout.As I have said, I am giving this a 9.5 and not a 10 because the first few jokes didn't land. That may not be the case for you, and if so, more power to you. I don't think this minor bump is worth that much in the long run- the laughs, skits, and story all make up for it throughout. If you love comedies, consider this a must see classic!I also should mention that 2 brothers, about 8 years old if I had to guess, came in the middle of the movie. I got nervous due to the fake looking but graphic violence, and I was also considerate of the language(S**t was said before, but in their presence only God's name was taken in vain.) Luckily, they didn't seem to mind the violence and many jokes went over their heads(They found the 3 question scene funny though!) Besides, they also spent most of the time on their tablets.There was a scene where someone mentions wanting oral sex. I can't remember if the kids were present then, but if they were they didn't ask what that was or anything. I asked Quora if I should have seen that with them and most of them said it proabaly went over their heads anyway. Still, consider this if you are watching with kids around, or for parental guidance for your child. My personal suggestion is 10 and up, depending on the child.Monty Python and the Holy Grail is most certainly one of the greatest comedies of all time, and fans of classic movies and comedies should see this one.

Hands Down One of the Funniest Movies Ever,"When it comes to comedies, they tend to be hit-or-miss movies. The sense of humor that goes into comedies reaches some audiences while others find it distasteful. That being said, it can be safely said that Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a comedy for virtually everyone. It is even a good experience for children since there is really only one suggestive scene and it is very brief.Nearly every scene in this film is comic gold and very quotable. Who can forget the black night remarking ""'tis but a flesh wound,"" the holy hand grenade, or even the opening scene (are you suggesting coconuts migrate)? Even great historical allusions are made for humor, such as a reference to the idea of the Trojan horse.The film also has a great sense of self-awareness and is very meta. The narrator comments on the animator at one point, a woman dressed in white refers to the script of the film, and the characters refer to specific scenes from earlier in the film. This is all in good fun and its self-awareness is primarily meant to add to the humor rather than commenting on art in general which more ""serious"" meta texts tend to do.However, this is a strange film when you take into account that from time to time in the film historians appear to briefly comment on the time period and are disregarded the next second as well as other people that are clearly not from the medieval time period becoming involved in the film. This aspect causes the film to end very strangely and abruptly. Monty Python and the Holy Grail would be stronger if it had a more definitive conclusion than the one it does.Filled with comedic gold, Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a very enjoyable experience.3.5/4.0",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975),"Hilarious. Raunchy. Odd. Ridiculous. Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a movie that was introduced to me in an advanced English class in high school (the ""end of senior year/last day of class) treat""). I could not believe I had never heard of this fantastic movie! The twists and quirks DO NOT END. Ever tried to straighten out a slinky? Perfect parallel comparison to The Holy Grail. There are spoofs on and references to: religion, peasants, Robin Hood, Camelot, King Arthur, knights in general, and enchanters. This is a movie I have watched four times since that day in high school, and twice since I bought it for my boyfriend, Andrew, as a birthday gift (yesterday). The movies I can stand to watch twice are rare and few between. Monty Python and the Holy Grail, however, I could watch twice in one sitting (with an intermission, of course ;) ).

An inspired piece of nonsensical British comedy,"Just tonight, my older brother and I watched Monty Python and the Holy Grail for the second time ever, at a friend's house. I first watched it just last year, and my brother first watched it several years ago. And I gotta say, it's an inspired nonsensical British comedy!Written and performed by stellar British comedy troupe Monty Python (Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin), the movie is a glorious parody of the legend of King Arthur and his quest for the Holy Grail. As such, it's loaded with mounds of clever and funny jokes and gags that it really leans into. In particular, there's the material involving the obnoxious French soldiers who mock King Arthur and his men. This actually served as direct inspiration for the French Peas from one of me and my brother's childhood video series, VeggieTales, specifically their role in Josh and the Big Wall. There's so many other jokes you could point out! The whole movie's just one self-aware joke after another. And the acting's pretty great from everybody, too!!In addition, the music is great! The score was done by De Wolfe Music, and it really helps to accentuate the comedy. The songs by Neil Innes are wittily written as well. It's all terrific!Everything considered, Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a funny and inventive piece of nonsensical comedy, and it's total self-awareness of how little sense it makes just makes it all the more delicious. Highly recommended!!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Watch This,"This film is the most well-rounded, unbelievably funny films throughout history. The film is a timeless classic for a few reasons: the hilarious plot, the great directing, and the stupendous acting. This film's success in plot can not be measured in any way that would do it justice. The initial scene that introduces the viewer to the film is simply unforgettable. The film can owe part of its success to the great directing style that was essential to the film. Also the film would never have seen such praise if it were not for the brilliant cast that depicted their character so vibrantly. In conclusion, the film was in every way superior to the scale used to even rank films. This film was not only a success, it blew that out of the water.

Funny Start,"The movie looses its mojo a bit after 30 mins or so. It's clever, just like the Life of Brian. Also, you feel that all punches Monthy Python take are as deep as possible. Brits understand that the rest of the world is stupid. As a result, dishonest British shows don't punch as deep as they could. Not necessary. Let's retain this bit and that bit of our pride. Monthy Python are never ashamed of calling things out. Which is why it works. At least the first 30 mins do. From there on, you would have to call out school uniforms, Germanic James Bonds, and possessing half of the US legally. That would have kept the full 90 mins funny. It's never irritating, though.

SP Monty Python Review,"Monty Python is a funny old school low budget movie. But never judge a movie by its cover, even though it is a low budget movie it can still bring great laughers to audiences. Gory scenes and some sexual content can be bad or good. If your teenager see's it watch them react to all the cheesy effects and old school humor. If your the person that likes a good graphic action movie i recommend you to NOT see it. If you're the person that likes a good laugh in front of a 1970's comedy. Either way, it will probably bring a hint of a smile to your face. Sometimes you can already see that its going to be a laugh out loud comedy, if your that type of person. This would be a perfect movie for a Sunday night, movie night. Grab some popcorn and watch the laughs begin.Silver Patriot Reviews",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Zany and Fun; a Bit Overwhelming,"""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" is a cult comedy classic from the British comedy troupe Monty Python, who were famous at this point for hosting a sketch comedy show on British television. The group comprised of John Cleese, Michael Palin, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Graham Chapman, and Terry Jones. While I think ""The Holy Grail"" is certainly a funny movie, I don't think it's their best. I personally prefer ""Life of Brian"" for its religious satire, but I think ""The Holy Grail"" is more fondly remembered by most people for the amount of pop culture influence it carries and its fourth wall-breaking gags.The main problem I have with Monty Python's first picture is just the overall zaniness of the plot is a little overwhelming at times. Individual scenes are excellent, and Python always excelled at doing little bits that never exceeded five minutes in length. The problem is that this is a ninety minute motion picture, and I feel like the scenes seem cobbled together and all over the place. One moment we're watching the Knights of the Round Table give a musical number, then we have French soldiers hurling cows at our heroes, then we get fourth wall stuff with a modern day historian filming a documentary getting run in with a sword. It all feels a little disjointed.It's still very funny, but I feel like it lacks the focus and scope of ""Life of Brian."" The ending is also super underwhelming. Apparently it was supposed to be much more epic at one point but they had to come up with what they gave us due to budget and time. Kind of a let down.""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" is a good laugh, and it's definitely one of the great comedy films from the 1970s. Watch it for the pop culture relevance, enjoy it for its silliness and lightheartedness. If you enjoy this, I suggest checking out the aforementioned ""Life of Brian"" and also Mel Brooks's ""Blazing Saddles"", which has a similar sort of ending but ends up a lot funnier and a lot more epic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

New perspective,"The saga of King Arthur and his knight companions is one the best know mythic cycles around the world. The Arthurian Cycle is for many people the traditional image of the chivalry world, where proud knight would go around the land seeking to defend the righteous, slay some dragons and save beautiful maidens in the name of a good/righteous king. But the most famous quest of this cycle is perhaps also one of the most unknown, as the greatest quest that the Round Table took part was the quest for the Holy Grail, one of the three holy relics of Christianity. Is a serious tale that speaks a lot of bravery, disappointment and mostly about Christian virtue and the worth of a pious life.
On this masterpiece of movie, we see a complete new view of this classical world purely with one mentality: being hilarious! From small jokes only understood by fans of the cycle to generic jokes that will make you fall on your behinds laughing. Perhaps one of the most striking features for me is the fact that it was not made by foreigner, but by the greatest British comedian group (Monty Python).

Python Silliness Still Holds Up in Special Two-Disc Set,"With the opening of Mike Nichols' and Eric Idle's ""Spamalot"" on Broadway last month, it's a good time to revisit the 1975 comedy classic that inspired the musical. Thirty years have elapsed since its original release, but it is still a movie that veers wildly back and forth between hilariously inventive and downright silly. If you can hold on tight, it's a worthwhile ride. Almost arbitrarily about a band of adventurers looking for the famed Holy Grail, the movie is just an excuse to create a nonsensical world steeped in medieval history and comically ironic violence. Directed by Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, it is typical Monty Python fare, which means a lot of clever wordplay and elaborate sight gags with big payoffs. The story begins with King Arthur and his page Patsy galloping on their invisible horses with their clapping coconut half-shells, as they search for worthy knights to take back to Camelot. From there, we meet a cast of characters that only makes sense in Python-land: an increasingly armless and legless Black Knight with a chip on his shoulder, a big Trojan Horse-like wooden rabbit, some disrespectful Frenchmen, castle-bound nymphomaniac maidens, the knights who dare to say ""Ni!"", a pedantic historian in the present day and even God, who seems rather impatient with the befuddled knights as He explains their quest for the Holy Grail. Amid these disparate elements, the film holds together as a clever satire on blind pious ignorance and the unquestioning acceptance of organized religion. The pacing gets sluggish toward the end, but the conclusion is riotous and just in time.Well packaged, the two-disc set has several extras. The main menu on the first disc is funny in itself with an option for the hard of hearing. There are two alternative commentary tracks. The first is newer and features Idle, John Cleese and Michael Palin; the second was recorded much earlier with Gilliam and Jones. Both are informative but only fitfully funny since they defer to the movie. The second disc has ""Mindless Sing-Alongs!"", where three scenes are taken from the film and subtitled so that once can sing along to the amusing ""Knights of the Round Table"" (which inspired the Broadway show title, ""We dine well here in Camelot, we eat ham and jam and spam a lot.""), ""Sir Robin"" or chant along in ""Monk's Chant"". There is a hysterical little ""educational"" short entitled ""How to Use Your Coconut"" and two scenes dubbed in Japanese. But the highlight is a 45-minute documentary called ""The Quest for the Holy Grail Locations,"" in which Jones and Palin explore the various film locations with humor and a sense of deserved nostalgia. Other features include a mock interview with the cast done during the filming, a Lego version of ""The ""Knights of the Round Table"" song and various sundry features suitable primarily for a Pythonite. For non-Pythonites, the film is still worth a look at a comedy that only looks better with all the witless dreck produced now.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

I came to this film expecting to see a real fantastic middle-age ambientated movie, what I got was one extremely absurd comedy that kept me laughting constantly. The final result is an spectacular motion picture, that utilices every resource it has to creat a joke: the low budget serves for the writing of the coconaut scene and the animation makes up very entertaining short transitions that, I assure you, at least will make you smile. The nihilism, political debate and satirical representations of god and religion not only make for good acts but also for good implicit social critiques.In simple words: the film is a masterpiece of comedy, whose influence has transcendent decades being even referenced and studied directly in the present.

The Pre-Cursor to The Life Of Brian,"I don't know enough about English History to understand all of the jokes in this film, but suffice to say that it is entertaining and funny, but not as good as The Life of Brian (little us).  Whereas Brian concentrates on a historical story that I can relate to strongly, this does the same but with English History.  The Python's run the same kind of spin on a famous yarn, pointing out how ridiculous the concept of The Holy Grail (and hence, the English Church) is.What does work is the appearance, to me, that they are producing a performance that would fit onto a stage and turning it into a film, which is one of the strongest points of this film.Ultimately, it isn't funny enough to be a great film, but if you've not seen this or The Life of Brian I would recommend both to ascertain just what the Python's were trying to achieve.

"""In God's name, show me the grail!""","Can I commit heresy by making a small confession? I don't find Monty Python very funny. Neither is Black Adder, and Sgt.Pepper isn't the greatest album ever made.Python is commendable, of course. The sketch show was interesting, and made innovative use of the television format. (I would say groundbreaking but I've seen Spike Milligan's ""Q""). Yet funny? Python has always struck me as the very worst kind of undergraduate humour, the sort of indulgent ""comedy"" that's uncool to dislike in any University.In reality, of course, I suspect the somewhat obvious sight gags and formula juxtapositions are liked by a very small minority. But the ultimate in Emperor's New Clothes causes black t-shirted, Wilde-quoting students to break into peer-pleasing hysterics at a knight who goes ""ni!"" A worry is that if you don't laugh then you'll be called ""thick"" or told that you just ""don't get it"". But I do get it, and it's nowhere near as clever as it pretends to be. The repetitive jokes (Knights on pretend horseback; ironic detachment to death; characters who talk too much), coupled with the attempt at a singular narrative make Holy Grail an exercise in tedium.It doesn't help matters that the six members of the group aren't exactly natural comedians. John Cleese, the supposed comic genius of the team is possibly the least funny. I mean, he's too posh, surely? Posh people aren't funny, that's the rule. Seeing middle-class boy Cleese bullying foreigners and the working classes in the overrated Fawlty Towers inexplicably amuses many. Michael Palin would be a straight man in any other troupe, and is far more suited to travelogues. Terry Gilliam, arguably the most talented and a hugely important director, would be the first to admit he's not that hot as a performer. And Graham Chapman, the tall camp one, must get bored playing the same character all the time. That leaves Eric Idle and co-director Terry Jones as the only members who can genuinely raise a smile.I was amazed to find that this is regarded on the IMDb as the strongest Python film, as I have seen a lot better. Holy Grail is symptomatic of every flaw in the series, with hardly a single joke coming off. Even Gilliam's surrealist animation is lacking here, and the songs are a chore to sit through. The few good gags involve a Trojan rabbit which the knights forget to hide in; Neil Innes singing the uncomplimentary tale of Sir Robin; a copyright disclaimer signed by Richard Nixon, and a Yorkshireman King. However, the only part that made me laugh out loud was the truly hilarious killer rabbit. Five funny jokes. 85 minutes. Oh dear. 4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975) Film Review,"Monty Python and the Holy Grail is my favourite comedy of all time. I laugh every single time I see it, and find something new that I didn't notice before. I strongly urge you to see it even if you're not a Python fan.The movie is directed by Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam. Before this film was released, Monty Python was a television series called 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' and a lot of the movie did feel sort of like a collection of skits from the show. That isn't really a flaw, but I thought I should address it in this review. Normally in a review, you have to explain the basic plot of the movie you're talking about to fill the reader in. But the thing with this film is that there really isn't one. Its more like a collection of scenes that are loosely tied together, like it was an episode of Flying Circus. There is still a plot, King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table have to find the Holy Grail for God, but in the middle the movie sort of forgets that and just does its own thing for a bit. Then in the third act it picks up the story again. Again, this isn't a bad thing because the movie is so damn strange that you hardly notice it. Speaking of funny, this is, in my opinion, the best comedy ever made. All of the actors play off each other really well, Its extremely well written, it has tons of verbal and visual gags that make me laugh almost every time I see it, and, well... its just funny! Some of it does seem slightly dated and you can see that they had a very low budget, but I think it just adds to the charm and strangeness of the film. Its also a great satire of all of the big budget epics of the 50's and 60's.In conclusion, I think Monty Python and the Holy Grail is the best comedy of all time. Its strange, funny and everything else that you want from a comedy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Have you seen Monty Python and the Holy Grail Yet?,"This movie is definitely one of my greatest influences as a director and writer of movies and its just a great movie.

I actually saw at somebody else's house but know i own the two disc special edition DVD (not so great in itself but i only bought it for the movie.The only other movies that make me laugh that much are Mel Brooks movies which have a very similar humor to them.There are plenty of other movies that people will say ""This is the best comedy ever"" i always think there always wrong but i don't argue with them and i say ""Have you seen Monty Pyton and the Holy Grail Yet""",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Britsh Comedy at its Best,"There is no doubt in my mind this is the Pythons best movie. I think the fact that they had such a small budget and were left to make the movie on there own just adds to it being simply amazing. You need to have a pretty strange sense of humour to truly appreciate a Python film. And if you do you will be in love with the movie as soon as it starts. I'm not a movie critique therefore I can't say what they did wrong and how they could have done it better. But on the other hand I don't think I would, this movie is British comedy at its best. And it proves that the Pythons are comedy legends who have created a true masterpiece.If you want to have a good laugh see this movie, you won't regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
It's a busy life in Camelot...,"Ah! A shining beacon (yes, a Grail-shaped beacon) of pure comedic genius. Far and away the funniest film I have so far been privileged to see. The problem with most comedies is that, no matter how amusing they may be on the first viewing, on subsequent showings they rapidly pall. Not so with the Holy Grail. I find that I get just as much fun out of anticipating each classic scene as I do out of watching it. I've lost count of the number of times I've seen this movie. If you possess any sense of humour at all you owe it to yourself to see this film at least once before you die. Oh, and the ending is NOT crap. It's perfectly in keeping with what has gone before. And make sure you get a version that retains the cheesy music at the end. Everyone should have to sit through that once. ;)",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Overrated stupidity,"Monty Python and the Holy Grail(1975)Review: There is not much to say about this movie. This is a very stupid and lame movie. The comedy at times (a lot) is forced and the delivery is poor. I hate the knights who say NI. That was funny for about three seconds. However when our hero Arthur deals with the Black Knight, things get funny. The scene alone is a hoot with the best lines in the movie. The Black Knight's reactions are priceless. The scene with Sir Robin was okay although came off as a mildy amusing scene. The ending on the other hand is horrid. I could not believe how bad the ending was. Even my brother who liked this agreed that the ending sucked. Of all the ways this could have ended, this was the worst way.The Last Word: At the risk of being unpopular, I won't let that sway my review. This was merely a lame movie. A lot of this was stupid. There are some funny scenes here, not much but some. Being in the top 250, a lot of you seem to enjoy this. I just did not care for this.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Well...,"What did i just watch? Like seriously this movie is the most low budget, pathetic, most nonsense and unpretentious movie i have ever watched. However, these are perhaps the reasons why it has become so popular. This movie doesn't want to be taken seriously, and that's exactly what you should do when you watch it. Prepare yourself for an objectively poor low-budget comedy, not for a cinematic masterpiece. You are going in to watch this movie in order to have a good time and enjoy the incredibly original and hilarious comedic moments. This is a comedy in the purest sense of the word, and it it supposed to be that way. That is what makes it special, the sheer joy you get by watching nonsense moments happen in a nonsense cinematic universe. This movie isn't great, it doesn't have great acting, great cinematography, a great message, or a great story. But it is so fun, so enjoyable, so idiotic, that you are gonna find yourself loving this movie. Now i am giving this 8/10 rating on account that this movie lacks a lot in cinematic quality and aspects that make a movie great, but in its own special way, Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a classic, and perhaps the best comedy i have ever watched.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Everything about this movie works,"1. There's nothing I can say about The Holy Grail that hasn't been said. This isn't a movie to analyse, it's a movie to just sit and soak up how wonderfully funny it is. Every moment spent figuring out why it is funny is a moment you could spend quoting the lines or just clutching your stomach as your gasp for air through your laughter.2. A low budget is what makes this movie. Half the best jokes (intentionally or not) come from the fact that the film's budget was low - coconuts for horses, poor visual effects, the rabbit, the animator having a fatal heart attack - its all good!3. The screenplay knows just how to drop in the most incredibly unexpected characters. Dennis the politically astute peasant, the soldiers who get bogged down discussing logistics of swallow airspeed velocity, the extremely forward women of Castle Anthrax and the effeminate Prince Herbert are just some of the hilarious characters who you would never expect to show up in a movie in this genre.4. The addition of the Holy Hand Grenade goes to show that it isn't just characters that bemuse and amuse.5. The amount of effort put into the film is still incredible. How many rewrites would they need for the Knights Who Say Ni scene to ensure the word ""it"" wasn't used? The ""he's not allowed to enter the room"" skit in Swamp Castle is something you'd expect from Abbott and Costello.6. The insults are amongst the best ever written. Anything said by the French Knight (played by John Cleese) is enough to have you crying with laughter.7. Come to think of it, anything Cleese does is hilarious. Whether he's Lancelot, so brave that he attacks a castle with his sword; the French Knight who gets a sick pleasure taunting Arthur; a famous Enchanter whose name Cleese forgot and so just ad-libbed ""Tim""; a peasant who was turned into a newt and got better or the Black Knight who is so deranged in his single-minded guarding of a random bridge that he allows Arthur to chop him to pieces before he gives up, he will provide the best lines in the film.8. Don't want to sell the rest of the cast short. Graham Chapman's angry frustration at people who don't act the way they should in a fantasy-epic is always hilarious. Terry Jones' high- pitched Bedivere and Michael Palin's Galahad are funny caricatures that are hilarious in their total lack of resemblance to the historical characters. Terry Gilliam is amusing as Patsy and the Old Man from Scene 24, among others. Eric Idle comes close to stealing the show, especially in the guise of Sir Robin, the Not Quite So Brave as Sir Lancelot.9. Terry Gilliam's animations often add a lot of amusement to the film, especially his rendition of God and the Monster of Aaaaarghhhhh. Some of the cutaways are so funny in their own right you don't even care that it just cutaway from the adventures of Arthur and his knights.10. The subplot of the murdered historian is strange, but given how the film ends I couldn't imagine any other way to end it. It just comes off as so appropriate for this low-budget, meta spoof of Arthurian legend.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Makes all other comedies obsolete.,"Imagine you are watching a movie with Robin Williams. Is your favorite thing the story, or his amazing goofiness that seems only a man of his pedigree can pull off? If it is the goofiness, you need to see Monty Python and the Holy Grail.

Add the six smartest minds in comedy not named John Landis and you have Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I am a smart light bulb, but after I watched Monty Python and the Holy Grail, it felt like my IQ dropped at least 5 points.

I am sorry to say but there are people that do dislike the humor... but they are the ones that you see putting down the good and overrating the bad now aren't they(click on their names to see what they hate or like). But I find this humor just right. Not to dry like 'Napolean Dynamite'(which I HATED!), not to dark like 'Beeteljuice', and not to crazy(and it is still crazy)like 'Airplane!'. And the fact that it is a combo of all of these genres of comedy and more is why it deserved to be up here as #49.Plus taking something as sacred and holy such as the last cup Jesus drank of and spoofing it all as much as all the knights tales made is hilarious. And most the humor is that type of humor that you just can't but at least giggle at. The silliness is amazing.*Spoilers*The Knights that say ""NI""(pronounced like ""knee""). I mean honestly... thats just crazy. Then the most famous part, the black knight battle, in which the black knight continues to fight until he has no more limbs. And yet he still wishes to fight. And then there is my personal favorite, the killer rabbit whoms't rips faces off.*End of spoilers*There is so much more to laugh at in this movie that allows it to be on this list.

Reading that might make you think that I hate the movie, but that is exactly why it is a funny and well known movie to everyone.Nothing really happens in the movie other than the Knights of the Round Table looking for the Holy Grail, while in the process random things happen to throw you off and make you laugh until you are on the ground in pain. I still remember that night at my cousins, after drinking 10 cans of coke and I would not stop laughing. ""We are the knights that say NI"" was the funniest part in the whole movie and made me laugh the hardest. Like whats so random is why NI? Such as random word, but that's why that is funny.

Python--an acquired taste,"While Python may be an acquired taste for most, I had no problems with this film. I may be a little on the bias side though. I have been a Monty Python fan for about fifteen of my twenty years on this planet. The movie is by far one of my favorites, along with all the other Python flicks. If you are looking for something to suit your taste for the Arthurian legend...well I am sorry the name of King Arther and the use of Camelot, a very silly place, is just about as far as you will get. If you can get past that there is a great, and funny, movie waiting to split your sides, and insult your intelligence. So for a good time all you need is a TV, VCR, and someone who appreciates Monty Python as much as you do. Word to the wise, if you decide to watch this movie with someone who has never seen Monty Python before...be prepared for the usual questions of ""what was that?"", ""Why did he do that?"", and of course the dreaded, ""Now that is just stupid!"".

A Comedy Legend; I Love It,"I've noticed that Monty Python is one of the most polarizing franchises I've encountered. A lot of people I know either love it or hate it, with few falling somewhere in between. I consider myself a casual fan. I've seen some of the television series, and I absolutely love HOLY GRAIL. For the record, I've never seen LIFE OF BRIAN and I've only seen bits and pieces of MEANING OF LIFE (and it didn't grab me the same way HOLY GRAIL did). Honestly, the first time I saw this movie I didn't really care for it. Absurdist humor hadn't really been my thing at the time, but the movie grew on me. Next thing I knew, I was buying my own copy, watching it multiple times, and planning on seeking out the rest of the Monty Python films. What's the movie about? It's all right there in the title: the story of the Holy Grail as seen through the eyes of some of the funniest men to come out of Britain. King Arthur (Graham Chapman) is tasked by God to search the lands for the mystical Holy Grail. Aiding him in his quest are Sir Lancelot the Brave, Sir Bedevere, Sir Galahad the Pure, and Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir-Lancelot, and their quest will take them to the far reaches of the land where they will encounter beautiful maidens, dangerous evils, and, well, the French. The whole movie is as if a Monty Python sketch was extended to a feature runtime, but unlike an SNL skit receiving the same treatment, it works.This movie is hilarious. That's all there is to it. I've watched it a half dozen times and it never gets old. It ages perfectly, too. It may have been made in the mid-70s, but the fact that it's meant to be a goofy low-budget comedy means that aging special effects don't mean a thing as long as it continues to make people laugh. Even people who haven't seen the movie have probably heard its dialogue quoted ad nauseam (""'Tis but a scratch!"") or would recognize the Knights Who Say Ni! Skip around the lawn while clacking a couple of empty coconut shells and most people will get the joke, while the rest will probably just think you've lost your mind. MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL is a classic at the pinnacle of many top ten lists for favorite comedies. Terry Gilliam, John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin are comedic geniuses. You've got to give them serious credit for being able to put together such a hilarious film while at the same time doing 99% of the speaking roles in the films themselves. There isn't a whole lot I can say about this movie short of showering it with love. Anyone who's a fan of the most absurd British humor will (or more likely already have) fallen in love with this movie.

Obviously not all the jokes are thought-provoking, some of them are just plain stupid, which is great because it goes well with the film as a whole. We follow the Knights on their quest for the Holy Grail as they fight the French, battle against temptation, fight an evil rabbit, encounter the black knight, and the knights that say ""Ni"".

No it's too perilous. Bet your gay' the story bounds along jumping from one madscap situation to another.  The french knights 'taunting' of the English had me falling from my chair in laughter and Michael Palin's face as a yokel demanding a witch to be burned asking 'does it hurt' brought me to tears.Althought the ending is a bit abrupt I have seen this film well over 50 times now and yet each bit is as funny as the first time.,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Like the television series, it's a pretty low-budget film, but the humour makes up for it. I would not call it a classic, but I would consider parts of this film to be funny while others go beyond 'funny' (or what I consider 'funny' to be.)

Worthy of the Title 'Holy',"Oh, don't get me wrong. This wasn't the greatest movie of all time, but it was excellent. I find the British brand of dry humour to be a superior one. I realize that there are plenty of people who would rather sit back and watch Adam Sandler, but this is classic. You have, in essence, possibly the most famous British legend of all time and the masters of the trade (the Pythons), and out of it you get a wild excursion filled with corny jokes and lame surprises, but presented in such an excellent way that you ADORE the film by the time it's done.True, the Pythons did a lot of other works, but this is their masterpiece (in my opinion anyway). So if you didn't watch it, or didn't like it, I strongly urge you to watch it again. There is nothing better than sitting down with a bag of popcorn and enjoying the spoof of a guy to prissy to clean his own gauntlets. So enjoy yourself.

The funniest of the Monty Python movies.,"Monty Python and the Holy Grail is silly. It's amazingly silly. In fact, it must be amongst the silliest films ever made, if not THE silliest film ever made. If you like silly, you won't be disappointed.The film sees the Python team attacking the legend of the search for the holy grail by the knights of Camelot, and includes lots of jokes featuring animals. If the mere mention of a badger, a sloth, a llama, a carp or a fruit bat gets you giggling, you won't be disappointed.It also gets laughs from such random nonsense as shrubberies, French soldiers, coconuts, a three-headed knight, and confusion between the numbers 3 and 5, while an indefatigable black knight who loses all his limbs and a killer rabbit add moments of cartoonish gore.With so much lunacy packed into an hour and a half, this is Python at its most entertaining (so much funnier than the over-rated Life of Brian).",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Absolutely Hilarious,"This movie is one of the funniest movies ever made. The combination of the low budget, one liners, and opening subtitles make it hilarious. If you're looking for a quiet, brainy, subtle comedy, this may not be for you. But if you want a laugh out loud, wet your pants, make your flatmates think there's something seriously wrong with you kind of comedy, you want to see this movie.See it for the opening subtitles alone. Two minutes in, you're already lying on the floor laughing hysterically.It tells the tale of King Arthur and his knights on their quest for the holy grail. Sort of. That's the general outline, anyway. There's not actually all that much in the searching for the grail, but that's not terribly important. In place of a good solid plot, you get the best one liners and physical comedy in the history of the world. I think it's a good trade off, personally.This movie has everything you could ever desire in a movie. It has action, adventure, comedy, and almost romance. Mostly comedy, though.All in all, this is an awesome movie. I've seen it probably fifty times, and I jump at an opportunity to see it again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Faded and not replaced,"There is indeed a lot in this film to bring it to cult status. The Holy Hand Grenade, Shrewberry and Knight that say Ni are so weird, beyond any measure that they have had no equivalent. It is wonderful that a film made with such a low budget could survive for so many years, but for me it just did not work, sorry.I also approached it with high expectations, I mean at 35 I only remembered watching it once when I was 8, and had only vague memories of it. Is it a matter of mood? Humour gone stale or repeated too often as ""a film they watched and they remember as great?"". Possibly. Some old films are better as memories than for what they are. For their cult status, once built, cannot be completely destroyed.Holy Grail is possibly one of them. Oh it still has its charm, especially its absurdity and the ""we had no budget, and we did better than you with a big one"". The Monty Python put a lot of talent there, and are still making a living out of those crazy years but 30 years on (yes, 30 years on), the comedy effect they achieve, which was such a breakthrough, has faded away, at least for a ""first time"" viewer of 2000. I do not mean something has come to replace it, except maybe Wayne's World, and this is probably the saddest conclusion. Nothing has really replaced the weird Monty Python. So watch this, enjoy it with all its faded absurd humour and hope the next laugh-out-loud film will come within your lifetime.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Octagenarian Dada,"What the Pythons did goes back to Dada in the 1910's—against logic and bourgeois complacency, for irrationality, chaos and the absurd as by-roads to unconscious inspiration. In this film, usually accepted as one of their best, they rail helter skelter against authority, masculine heroism, sexual hypocrisy, the chastity of romantic legend.Some of the skits work, the coconuts, duck, French siege. It's funny when it is, precisely because it's non-sense, a shrubbery of very smalls rocks. More often, it's just silly. The more of logic that is applied to explain say, coconuts in Britain, the more ludicrous logic appears to be, we recognize the truth of this in our own irrational world.But the overall film fails for my taste.It had two competing directors in Jones and Gilliam, this may account for some of it. But mostly, it is poor cinematic storytelling, one skit after the other. Even surrealism benefits from some overall framework for the experience, something to be directed to beyond reason.At the time, this wasn't as clear as it is now. The Czechs were still making movies in this disconnected vein, Svankmajer to this day. Late 60's Godard, more famously. All those things were very much in the counter-culture air in the 1970's.So as with most things of the era, this is fun for a while, fun but stale.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"If this isn't funny, nothing is.  Stands test of time.","The Holy Grail is not only the epitome of a funny, silly movie but also it actually stands the test of time. Maybe it was made in 1975 but even today people regularly quote from it and use scene clips from it to express points and relevant humor. Besides, how could a movie based on a time period centuries earlier ever become obsolete? The movie opens up with my favorite scene where a peasant with chutzpah, who seems to know too much about politics for a peasant, argues with a king and points out details the king finds valid but very inconvenient. It then goes on and on making fun of various customs of the day-actually mocking many true practices of the time (just as other Python movies do). You can tell the movie was written with a decent grasp of education in history even though it is low budget in implementing it. But it does not stop there-the movie isn't satisfied with only making fun of history so it proceeds to make fun of itself.I won't spoil it for you although you likely already saw it. But let me just say this: if you want to make it to the end, forget any sense of logic or reason before you watch it and study all you can about European and African swallows and cocoanuts.

One of the greatest comedies ever made,"This is one of those films that I can't believe I had never seen before now. Also on this list are the likes of It's A Wonderful Life and The Great Escape, but they will be seen all in good time. It's a shame I had waited so long to be honest, as it is quite possibly the most hilarious and brilliant comedy I've ever seen. There's not much to say about Monty Python that hasn't already been said, but it is well known that the group (John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam, Michael Palin) were revolutionaries in the art of comedy, combining a number of elements to create an overall surreal and ingenious sense of humour.The film is based loosely on the legend of King Arthur (Chapman) and the Knights of the Round Table. Arthur is on a quest to find the Holy Grail, and with his fellow Knights, encounters a number of dangerous and ridiculous obstacles along the way. These include a castle guarded by French knights with 'outrageous accents', the Black Knight, the Knights Who Say Ni, the Three-Headed Giant, the Rabbit of Caebannog, and the Beast of Arrrrrrggggghhhhh.Whereas Life of Brian was a very intelligent and quite biting satire on religion, Holy Grail is pretty much just an excuse to be extremely silly. From the opening scene, where Arthur arrives pretending to ride on his imaginary horse while his squire bangs two coconuts together to make a galloping noise, you know that the film is not going to play by any comedy rules, and is certainly not afraid of being just plain weird. It plays out in an episodic structure, much like The Flying Circus, but the team are clearly at their most comfortable here and are certainly no slouches when it comes to comedy set-pieces. My favourite would probably be the famous Black Knight, who when Arthur has hacked three of his limbs in a brilliantly gruesome manner, is still trying to fight (""'tis but a scratch!"").The comedy comes from all angles - word-play, visual gags, surrealism, post-modernism, blink-or-you'll-miss-it background gags, and simply pulling silly faces - and they come thick and fast, and include more laughs per minute that most comedies will be lucky to muster in 90 minutes. This is simply a brilliant film, and will forever remain amongst the greatest comedies ever created.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Yeah, I'm Gonne Get A Lot of Down Votes...","I don't see the genius.Let's just get this clear first... I was born in 1995. That makes me 18 years old. I don't hate this movie one bit, but I do think the humor has aged. I don't laugh as hard because Monty Python humor has influenced every other comedy out there, and thus it's like I've seen it before. I'm sure in 1975 everything in this film would have been out of nowhere and nonsense. After seeing a movie like Anchorman, it's hard to say I laughed as much because Anchorman is so much more out there. It outdoes this film.But regardless, I appreciate this film, as I appreciate Monty Python, because I know it did a lot for comedy. Without it, there'd probably be no Anchorman as we know it.GOODThe WRITING is good. Even for a nonsense comedy, it creates some likable characters and interesting scenarios. JOKES ARE PROPERLY SET-UP and even though the film essentially uses the set-up-punchline by scene formula rather than focusing heavily on a story, everything feels relevant enough (unlike a 100 Hundred Ways to Die in the West or whatever that movie was called).The ACTING is great. Not much to say, but you never feel like your watching an actor.While the COMEDY is aged from what I saw, it still had some very funny moments. And I'm sure if I saw the film drunk or with friends, I would laugh a lot more.BADThe only bad thing about this very influential film is that the COMEDY HAS AGED. Movies like Anchorman have outdone it, at least for my generation.VERDICT8/10It's a well-made low-budget film that's had a noticeable impact on comedy. While I can't enjoy it like someone who lived in the 70's, I still found it funny at some points and perhaps some others would even find it funnier than I did. Maybe it's just not my type of comedy. Either way, I won't deny this film deserves every bit of praise it gets. It just won't get a 10/10 from me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

"""Holy Grail"" as medicine","When I was a teenager my Mom taught me an invaluable lesson: whenever you're down and depressed, or in a bad mood, put on a funny movie or TV show; it won't ""get you"" at first but eventually it will put a smile on your face. And, boy, was she right, and there's no better cure for a case of the blues than ""Holy Grail.""Years ago, I was in a real depressed funk about a breakup with my girlfriend. I mean, I was devastated. Not caring about anything in the world at the time(I think we've all been there and know that ""great"" feeling), I decided to heed my Mom's advice and played my tape of ""Holy Grail."" But nothing was making me laugh at all, until about an hour into the film. And you know what scene finally ""got me?"" They're about to start the wedding at Swamp Castle, and Launcelot begins his mad dash to save(what he thinks) is a fair maiden. And they show the same clip of him running towards the castle, with the dramatic drumroll, but he never gets any closer. It's the same clip, over & over! We all know the scene; I don't need to describe it. Like many of you, I've seen the movie countless times, but for some reason I found that more scene more hilarious than ever before. I rewound the tape and watched the movie again from the beginning, and was laughing my ass off as usual. I was still in the funk, but the movie provided a temporary respite, and a giant leap towards getting over the breakup.To make someone laugh in that situation, a movie must be just incredibly funny. You guys have all made great posts about this fantastic film, and I just wanted to add my two cents.It is truly a masterpiece, and if you are ever depressed for any reason, put it on.

The best Monty Python movie,"The Holy Grail is the first feature film from Monty Python, the British sketch show comics who had become famous in the late 60's / early 70's with their BBC TV series. It tells the story of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table in their quest for the Holy Grail. But to be honest, the story is merely a thread in which they link a series of funny set-pieces together. For me, this is the funniest movie they ever made. To be honest, there really are far too many amusing moments to list them but needless to say they combine cleverness with stupid humour and the tone is consistently absurd. But if I was forced to names the scene that cracks me up the most I would have to pick the one that introduces us to Brave Sir Robin – the singing of his sarcastic minstrel makes me roar with laughter every time. This character is actually a bit unusual though, in that he is not performed by any of the Pythons because the vast majority of the other roles are covered by the team of John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin, with Graham Chapman mainly playing the central King Arthur role in a very funny straight-man performance. Terry Gilliam appears in minor roles but is most notable for providing several of his distinctive animations. In summary, this is a very funny movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Fractured Fantasy,"The King Arthur legend is no doubt one of my favorite fantasies and throughout the years there have been multiple interpretations of the legend in the visual medium, so good and some bad but all the same that legend like so many other stories has lived on even to this day. I was even fascinated with the concept of lost/undiscovered relics and the Holy Grail of course is one of them, let alone on a side note I'm a Christian. Parodies comedies are another thing I really love and when I heard that there was a parody on this legend, I had to check it out and I wasn't disappointed. This film is one of my favorite comedies, parodies in the sub genre, but also one of my favorite films in general. On a side note this was the film that got me into the ""Monty Python Flying Circus"" skit show which at the time I never heard about.There's really not much to say, this is one of those parodies that are done right like in most parodies it takes a story and turns it upside down and on it's head, while the characters all play it straight all unaware their in a parody. The whole flying circus ensemble are all in the film and they all as usual do a great job at making us laugh let alone, the fact they all play multiple roles in the movie.Both the verbal and visual jokes are just fraking hilarious. Though I wouldn't say everyone of them are hits, like that whole verbal joke on swallows I always thought was boring but that's me. But that's what you get with most comedies and parodies, it's the ones that hit that count the most. Like in their skit show, each of the jokes are hilarious because of how smart or strange they really are; let alone how the film isn't afraid to go the extra mile sometimes with it's blood and violence which was revolutionary for it's time, it's now common in shows like ""South Park"".There are so many scenes that are just memorable that I don't want to give them all away. From the introduction of the Holy Hand Grenade it's pretty much a verbal and visual joke going together, from the fact the item has a biblical passage, let alone it even exists in the Christian faith at all. But of course my favorite scene is The Tale of Sir Lancelot, where we see Lancelot battling. Well OK, I wouldn't really call it a battle, it was more of a slaughter as we see Lance is just constantly killing everyone in the castle not even stopping to take a breath, what makes it really hilarious is the fact that no one is putting up any resistance they've all practically set themselves up to be killed. I even love that swashbucking music which makes the sequence both exciting and all the more hilarious because it reflects just how crazy things really are.I love how in a way the film itself is a character, from it's fourth wall breaking to just how aware of how low budget the film is made. Like the whole pretend horse thing which is hilarious because you easily see the person making the film is a complete money grubber that he didn't want to shell the money to buy real horses. Though all the same it's just hilarious how the actors for pretend horses still perform really well, as if they really are on horses. Let alone the ending which cracks me up because it's a payoff to a really strange subplot that's been going on, the subplot seemed like another episode from some procedural show. You could say it's if the procedural shows like ""CSI"", ""NCIS"", or any other you can think of ever crossed over with a fantasy story which when you think about is kinda a crazy but cool concept.This film like the legend of the grail is ageless.Rating: 4 stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

So warning don't watch this or any other movie over 3 times in a single day but even if you do you'll still love it(though not as much as me cause you might feel like an overworked directer) I extremely highly recommend this movie for anyone who likes to laugh their brains out.

Not your ordinary flesh wound,"Greetings again from the darkness.  I just attended the theatrical re-release with my 17 year old son, and must say I am glad I did. Originally released when I was in high school, today's teenage generation NEEDS to see this movie to discover that comedy does not necessarily involve the spewing of four letter words.  An amazing combination of sight gags and crackling dialogue, one can't resist many outbursts of laughter.  Yes, there is a little blood ... ridiculously staged by today's standards, but it is all in good fun.  Many levels on which to review the movie, but all I want to say is, drag your teenagers to this movie.  They will be better off having seen it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Disgusting movie. If you want to throw up voluntarily, watch this movie!","I didn't expect much when starting to watch this movie. I was told it was a funny movie. The fact is, it is not funny at all, it's disgusting. After 15 minutes watching it, I felt I want to vomit. I got dizzy. The jokes were so bad and stupid. The words can't be understood easily. some scenes were violent and horrible. I regret watching it. It is a very low intelligent movie. It was made with low taste of jokes. I don't recommend to watch this movie, especially children. There were some violent scenes that were made funny (but not funny at all!!) as if they were jokes. This could potentially give children wrong views. I wish such movie would never be made ever again.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
This is like a school play...,"Just saw this movie. I find it unbelievable that this is rated as high as it is. The kind of humour that is portrayed is almost schoolboyish (in fact some of the parodies at my school were better, imo). Mouthing absurd insults, making faces - come on...I know there are a few one-liners which are good, but the whole movie doesn't go down well at all. Absurdity does not a comedy make.In hindsight it maybe that appreciation of a comedy is very specific to the culture and the individual.

Ha! hA! HA!,"Funny movie, very funny movie. I tend to compare this type of comedy in the same likes as ""The Naked Gun"" and ""Airplane!"". Being completely honest, I think ""Airplane!"" is superior to this film and find that this movie is a tad overrated. I mean, what about ""Life of Brian""?

Monty Python and The Murderous Rabbit👍,"Let's make something clear. This movie is not for everyone. It's many things that you may not understand of the religious metaphorical humor. But if you understand it, and accept everything they say in the movie, it's just so funny. No one make movies like that anymore... That is so sad, because this is just one of the most classic and iconic comedy movies ever. King Arthur is making a team to make the biggest kingdom and also to find the Holy Grail, as God told them to do. That's the plot, not so complicated, but they are showing many terrible things from the middle age, in a funny way. They are showing in this movie the stupidity of humans and what we have done wrong. That is the biggest moral in the movie, that is showed very well. The music was rememberable and good, great actors and the movie was built and made in a very good well. 100% funny, very funny, you can almost laugh over the whole movie, while you are watching. A complete nonsense, that make sense in the same way. Recommend it very much. One of the best comedies ever made!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Again I am part of the small minority,"I was under the assumption that this movie, or one of the ""Monty Python"" movies, was on AFI's list of funniest comedies of all time.  This is probably the movie, since I also see it as Number 53 on the IMDB favorites list.  Why?  Beats me.Now, I have only seen glimpses of the classic ""Monty Python"" show.  I think most of the actors involved have real talent.  I've seen Eric Idle, John Cleese and Michael Palin in other movies and TV shows, and think they are all very talented comedians who are capable of making me laugh hysterically. I don't know if the show is any funnier than this movie, but I hope it is. But now that I saw this movie, I'm not too enthusiastic about checking out the show.I didn't think ""This is Spinal Tap"" or ""Caddyshack""--two gloriously acclaimed comedies that are also on the AFI list--were all that brilliant either.  Again, I am part of the minority.  With those two films, I received angry emails by people saying that the humor flew over my head and I should watch those films again to see if I missed something.  Well, in the case of ""MP and the Holy Grail,"" what the hell did I miss???!!!  Let me see:  we have a Knight that says ""Ni"" and a rabbit that bites people's heads off. Wow!  Subtle!  If those gags flew over my head, then it was for the right reasons.  And worse of all, each gag is stretched out to the point where you just want to punch these actors out.  So you have a lame gag, equipped with a lame setup and lame punchline--let's just rub salt on a wound and repeat it over and over again!  Maybe ""Monty Python"" is an acquired taste.  Maybe I have to watch several episodes of the show to get adjusted to the humor. There has to be some reason why it became one of the most memorable sketch comedies shows, worldwide.  But that still doesn't guarantee I will eventually find humor in these goofy gags.I don't like to stereotype British comedy, because there are in fact some that I find quite funny.  And their humor is not always bland as a certain number of (American) viewers say it is.  I've seen episodes of ""Mr. Bean"" with Rowan Atkinson, and think it is one of the funniest shows I've ever seen.  I also like Atkinson's other show ""The Thin Blue Line"" and ""Keeping Up Appearances"" (I forgot the name of the actress who stars on the show). But the humor in this movie is as bland as bland can get.  Why build a series of elaborate set pieces when all you're going to have are a bunch of characters doing lame VERBAL gags?  Throughout the film, I couldn't help but ponder, ""If only Mel Brooks would've written the script...God, it could've been so much funnier!""  What we have are comedic angles of the tales of such warriors as King Arthur and Robin Hood, and not one satirical jab came to mind?  I'm still a firm believer that there should be a certain element of truth to every joke.  Some good examples are in Mel Brooks' ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" when Cary Elwes (playing Robin Hood) says, ""I'm the only Robin Hood who can speak with an English accent"" and when the Chief of Nottingham is portrayed as the Chief of Rottingham.And who came up with the decision to show lots of blood?  I know the violence looks fake, but come on!  This is a comedy!  Again, rubbing salt on a wound.I thought the film was lame from the get-go, from the minute they started that running gag involving King Arthur pretending to ride up to the castle on a horse by having his peasant bang coconut shells together to make it sound like a horse trotting.  But as the film goes along, it gets more and more annoying.  It's only ninety minutes long, but it felt like an eternity. ""Braveheart"" would feel shorter in comparison (because that happens to be a great movie).For those who are fans of the ""Monty Python"" series, you might want to argue my opinions.  And I'm sure you'd probably take my criticisms for granted. But I'm not going to pretend to laugh and pretend I enjoyed the film thoroughly to go along with the bandwagon.  For those who think I'm a comedic snob, I'll tell you what I think is funny.  ""My Cousin Vinny"" is funny.  ""The Big Lebowski"" is funny.  ""Analyze This"" is funny.  Those are only a few of the comedies I find hilarious.  I can go on and on.  If I don't find these boring, repetitive gags funny, then so be it.

one of the greatest comedies ever,"i have discovered that either people love this movie, or hate it. most of the people who hate it find it incredibly random. Of course, it is incredibly random, which is the whole point that makes it hilarious. I mean, come on. the Holy Hand-grenade? The Three-headed Knight? The random historian sub-sub-plot?? It's just good fun. And, it's not like other comedies where you watch it once or twice and get bored with it. It's a classic. You can watch it again and again, and still find it just as amusing. (although, it really is sad when you and your friends can act out entire scenes from the movie because you've seen it so many times...like me..) And the special edition DVD offers it in Japanese. Now, what true Monty Python fan could resist watching this classic in Japanese?? it's just adds to the hilarity of the film. Anyway, to sum this up, unless you're a incredibly random person who enjoys watching offbeat comedies (like me!!) then, you probably won't like this.

Perhaps the funniest movie ever made,"What sets this movie apart from many others is the way it combines slap-stick style antics with very clever dialogue.

To find it he and his knights will have to pit their wits and strength against all manner of foe, including the Black Knight, the Knights who say Ni, the Rabbit of Caerbannog, the Legendary Black Beast of Aaargh, The Bridge-keeper of the Bridge of Death, and some pesky, trash-talking French soldiers who seem to thwart them at every turn.One of the funniest movies ever made (if not THE funniest).

Classic comedy for the ages,"Greetings. If you are actually reading a review for Monty Python's Holy Grail, you are either newly returned from a 50 year coma or are recovering from a serious moose attack and have nothing better to do. If you've been in a coma for half a century it would stand to reason you have a lot to catch up on, and surely Monty Python is a wise use of your time. For the moose-afflicted, I wish you a speedy recovery.Monty Python is a simple test to determine compatibility with someone. ""Python"" is a brand of quirky British whit and comedic timing that is a style unto itself. If your sense of humor finds Monty Python funny then you have an immediate kinship with others of similar taste.The Holy Grail is hilarious from start to finish, and fans of this movie have easily viewed it dozens of times. The dialogue is ridiculous and full of memorable character exchanges between Arthur and the mud peasants, Arthur and the Dark Knight, Arthur and the Frenchmen, and on and on and on.Visually this movie is filled with practical effects, filmed on location in rustic locations and interlaced with trademark Monty Python stop-motion animated scene transitions.And if you ever find yourself confronted with a rabid moose, stand perfectly still. They can't see you if you don't move. Alternatively, feel free to run. Really it'll be your call. I mean, you're the one in the woods with a rabid moose so whether or not you recall some nitwit's advice from an online movie review will be something to tell the grandkids.

I've never laughed at anything so much before,"When I sat down to much this film I had already seen Life of Brian and thought that that was absolutely brilliant, so I expected Hoil Grail to be quite funny, but not in the same league as Life of Brian. How wrong I was.Everyone talks about Life of Brian being the funniest film of all time by a country mile; however I laughed a lot more at this film and I think that the controversy of Life of Brian means that not many people notice how funny and brilliant this film is. I think that Life of Brian is cleverer and there probably are more funny bits in Life of Brian, but I only laugh at the seriously funny things and I very rarely laugh more than once at sitcoms. So Holy Grail has more seriously funny bits in it and in virtually every scene had me in stitches.See this film because Monty Python is the funniest thing ever, as well as Fawlty Towers (but Fawlty Towers was written by Python John Cleese).",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Not just funny, but intelligent","I first saw this movie in a theater in its first run. There was not a big audience and those that were there, didn't really seem to be ""getting"" it. On the other hand, I was quite literally rolling in the aisle as I fell out of my seat laughing. (And to fall onto one of the filthiest floor in creation, you have to be REALLY laughing hard.)One reviewer -- one of the VERY few low scorers -- thought that the humor was ""dated"" and that humor has ""evolved"". Really? A casual skimming of TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, etc., turns up a descent into the Idiocratic ""Ow... my balls"", Benny Hill-like silliness, or obtuse locker room sexual innuendo, to enumerate just a few. The funniest of today's comics are all derivative of Python in some respect.Python's jokes are seldom just ""funny"" -- that's just the visible tip of the knife. I've come to think of this (and Life of Brian) as one of the great contributions to absurdist theater -- as significant as Ionesco, Beckett, Camus. Of course, to analyze humor destroys the laugh -- it's the quantum mechanics of lunacy. However, in the Holy Grail, the philosophy is there for the taking. The laughter is the spoonful -- or bucketful of sugar -- to help the medicine go down.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

And the plot, just like ""Life of Brian"", was fun to follow and it was one of those rare movies where I HAD to have something to eat with it. (I do that for every movie i'm excited to watch or is just very interesting).There was honestly no wrongs about this. It didn't drag anywhere, it didn't ever get too boring.

I both realized this when watching this movie, and realized how classic myth and history is basically set-up for any Python comedic twist.The folk-singing Sir Robin crew and the virtuous Gallahad scenes are classic, as well as the brief/blunt God the Father (or is it Jesus) opening up the slide-doors cloud to give Arthur his mission.It is hard not to laugh at anything Python, and ""Holy Grail"" definitely provides them.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Although the film had a low budget, the cinematography was not bad. The blend of live-action and animation added to the comedic factor.

Monty Python and The Holy Grail (1975),"This was weird experience but hilarious. Aw man what a great way to start fantasy month with this medieval dark comedy. I don't know much about the Python group but Terry Gilliam the director I've heard about from two other films of his I wish to see like Time Bandits and The Brothers Grimm. King Arthur, accompanied by his squire, recruits his Knights of the Round Table, including Sir Bedevere the Wise, Sir Lancelot the Brave, Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-As-Sir-Lancelot and Sir Galahad the Pure. They receive a message from God to go on a quest for the Holy Grail. Throughout their quest more silliness ensues. The beginning of the film when King Arthur is looking for knights to recruit is maybe my favorite part of the film. But as they are then given their quest I find myself laughing more and more. It's a relevant comedy with lines like ""Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. If I went around saying I was an emperor, just because some moistened bint lobbed a scimitar at me, they'd put me away!"" The taunting French guard was also super hilarious. The directors are great I had only heard of one which I mentioned earlier was Terry Gilliam. Terry Jones, he did two of Python Movies Life of Brian and Meaning of Life. They have a great comedic style. This film is just completely off its rockers. Monty Python and The Holy Grail, is probably the best comedy I have ever seen.

The king of the ridiculous,"""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" is a low-budget, ridiculous, hopelessly anachronistic ride that will still leave you laughing until your insides hurt.

In addition to all this, the movie also features amusing dialogue, witty one-liners, and a fair amount of meta-commentary.While the episodic structure of the film and ""random"" humor may well put some viewers off the movie, overall, it succeeds wonderfully at its intent: to be an absurd, funny, and at times surprisingly intelligent comedy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
a well known classic,"It's a must for British humor lovers. Since its the Monty Python we are talking about, it taks time to get into that kind of humor but whenever you are in take good care of your stomach because it's going to hurt a lot. Prases from this movie had enter everywhere which only prove its classic status but beware if you're not used to British humor.I'm saying that because I sent once my brother to watch the film and he returned desapointed but after we sat again together he almost fell to the floor :)Conclusion: You must see it even if to find one this is not your style or just to know what other people talking about.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Truly one of the greatest comedies .,"And now my son has seen this twice with me and has begun driving his mother nuts with Holy Grail quotes. This movie is so good it transcends generations with ease. 30 plus years later you can still find t-shirts, posters, ringtones, and geeks who know every line.And yet it was done on the teeniest of budgets, not even enough money to rent horses. They actually had to borrow money from a couple of rock bands that were fans of Flying Circus.If that doesn't make the Python gang the greatest comedy group of all time, I don't know what ever could.If there is actually anyone out there that has not seen this movie..

Bad Ending and still ...,"... I just love it. Despite the ending! It is so weird, that I couldn't explain it to you, so you have to watch it. But just don't let it ruin the whole movie for you. It didn't ruin the movie for me although I was disturbed, to say the least.Monty Python (humour) is well known, through their TV series ""Flying Circus"". The series has all the main players that are involved in this picture too. And it is a movie, other than Meaning of Life, which was a sketch show.If you know Pythons than you know what you're up for, if not you might not actually like what you see. Although most people do as is evidently through the voting here at IMDb.com!

A Summary in so many words would have to be.... NI,"Monty Python and the Holy Grail is an overall great movie directed by Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, starring the usual suspects in a Monty Python film such as Graham Champman, and John Cleese. In this film we find ourselves following our main character King Arthur (Graham Chapman) as he gathers his knights of the round table to embark on a quest to find the Holy Grail. The actors in this film defiantly DO NOT live up to any historical depiction of any king or knight that may have ever existed, but this is what we have come to love and expect out of the Monty Python crew. The style and theme of this film can only be described as cheap in the best sort of way. One would assume that in medieval times travel would mostly be done on horses, well Monty Python does not disappoint. No expense was speared when collecting the coconuts used to produce hoof sounds throughout the movie. That's right there are no horses in this movie, just men acting as if they were on horses while another man follows them around with coconuts. In conclusion I would have to say that following these men around on their adventure is definitely time well spent. I'll be watching this movie over and over, and will be getting just as much enjoyment out of it the hundredth time as I did the first.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Surreal Fun,"A mad film nearly as good as their Life of Brian. I remember walking into a local cinema as a teen and thinking that's different. If only more mad stuff like this one was made now in this humourless age. I think we in the 70's made fun of ourselves and things in general more. Less easily offended. I digress. This has it all-the killer rabbit,the Black Knight who won't give in, the Holy hand grenade,the filthy French not to forget Sir Not appearing in this film. Or Tim the Enchanter. Just watched it again this morning and pined for the happier day's of the 70's. This came out when i was 13. Bloody hell i'm old.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
The Definitive Monty Python Film,"King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table are in search of the Holy Grail. Along the way, they must face off against killer rabbits, lonely women and the police.As the film is over thirty years old and has been sen by millions, there's little need to write another praising review. But let's just say this: Monty Python knows humor. Or, perhaps, knew humor. Some may debate about which film of theirs was the best -- some prefer ""Life of Brian"" or ""The Meaning of Life"" -- but I don't think any fan dislikes ""Holy Grail"", and I would say it's the best film to introduce to a Python virgin.Sure, British humor isn't the same as American humor. And modern humor isn't the same as humor in the 1970s. But this doesn't mean one is better than the other -- there's a timeless quality to ""Holy Grail"". I was first exposed to it in my youth, maybe fifteen years ago or more... and it was already a classic.That's all I'll say. No trying to push this film on anyone... it's probably one you've already seen or have been told to see. It stands as one of the few comedies in IMDb's top 250, and with good reason -- this film hits home like no other comedy can.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"A flick to make you say ""Ni!""","I've watched it about 10 million times since 1976 and I still love it. I can quote the dialogue verbatim. I really think it's the funniest film ever made, with the Mel Brooks flicks running a close second. It does a send-up of a lot of things -- academia, medieval legends, historical events. Amazing how those six guys do all those parts. The two best scenes were the fight between Arthur and the Black Knight (""You yellow b**tard! Come back here and get what's coming to you. I'll bite your legs off."") and the clash with the French (""I wave my private parts at your auntie, you cheesy-loving second hand electric donkey-bottom biters.""). The other Python flicks (except for the abysmally awful ""Jabberwocky"") were good, but fell way short of ""Holy Grail."" Now I've just learned ""Holy Grail"" is being made into a musical. Oh, man. I'll be a basket case if I can't get to that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Quest for the Holy Grail of Movies,"Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a comedic parody of the classic Arthurian legends by Monty Python. It is a great movie that is extremely funny.
 Monty Python and the Holy Grail focuses most of the story on King Arthur and his quest for the holy grail. It takes place in Britain. The movie makes jokes of many things including British-French relations and the mystical tales in the Arthurian legends. Monty Python and the Holy Grail takes place during Medieval Europe. 
 While not visually impressive it is not bad looking and has it's own unique style of showing, what looks like animated medieval murals during transitions. My favorite bit is about the Holy Hand-grenade of Antioch. King Arthur uses the grenade to kill a vicious man eating monster, a rabbit, and they explain how to use it in about five different ways.

One of the greatest comedies ever,"The Black Knight. The Trojan Rabbit. The taunting Frenchman. The Witch Trial. The philosopher peasant. And the list goes on and on. This film showcases the Python's amazing imagination.Some may claim that ""Airplane"" or ""Blazing Saddles"" is funnier. Let me highlight one scene that elevates Monty Python's humor over all others. We start out with King Arthur and his servant Patsy ""riding"" over the plains. As they crest the hill, the sound of the horses is revealed to be Patsy simply banging two coconuts together to create the sound. Now, most comedians (Mel Brooks, the Zuckerman brothers) would've stopped there with that visual gag. The Python's brilliance lies in what they do next. King Arthur get's into an argument with another man over the coconuts. Where did King Arthur get the coconuts? How could they arrive in Britain? The conversation is even funnier than the visual sight gag.The funniest film ever made.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Comedy masterpiece,"Probably the most well-known work of the British comedy troupe Monty Python, next to Life of Brian. It has endured for almost three decades now and is still considered to be one of the best comedies ever made. And for a good reason. Everything that made Monty Python great is present in this film, their first full-length feature film: the absurd situations, the clever wordplays, the willingness to stretch joke as far as needed, the hilariously incompetent characters, the nonplussed deliveries, the whole package.What separates this film from many modern comedies is its intelligence and poise. Certainly some of the humour is a touch lowbrow and/or silly, but some of it is extremely intelligent and depends on the viewer being able to follow the situation and the dialogues. I also enjoy how they've managed to reach the feel of Arthurian times through costuming and illustrations. Most of the humour is also patently absurd. And yet it all fits together strangely well. One of the hallmarks of British comedy is stoic delivery. The characters never think they're saying something funny, rather they just happen to live in this bizarre world. There's never a sense of winking at the audience with this group, which is much better in my opinion.This is my favourite comedy film by far. It's very quotable, every single joke makes me at least crack a smile, the whole story is strangely compelling and as a whole it's just a blast to sit through every now and then. A beloved classic for a reason. See it. Arthur, your king, compels you!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"""She turned me into a newt! I got better.""","A surreal, comedic parody of the Arthurian legend, of the Knights of the Round Table, and their quest for the Holy Grail, Monty Pyhon's first genuine movie (And Now For Something Completly Different was essentially just a collection of the classic sketch series, best sketches, refilmed for the big screen), amounts to nothing more than a series of hilarious comedy set pieces, strung together by its plot which is wholly incidental. Right from the beginning, even the opening credits fall victim to the team's trademark craziness. Graham Chapman heads the cast, as the idealistic King Arthur, who is accompanied by his trusted squire, Patsy, (Terry Gilliam) recruits a small army of Knights which include (John Cleese) Sir. Bedevere the wise (Terry Jones), the chaste Sir Galahad the pure, the over-zealous Sir Lancelot the brave,(John Cleese), and the cowardly Sir. Robin the-not-quite-so-brave (Eric Idle). Ultimately going their separate ways in the hopes of finding it, for what means God only knows (quite literally as it's the almighty who sends them on their merry way to find it), and in doing so they encounter a number of off the wall mishaps and misadventures.The movie is quintessential Monty Python, at its most silly, and there is none more than Camelot, with Arthur not wanting to go there, as it ""'tis a silly place"". The laugh's come thick and fast, with the exasperated monarch meeting two infuriating anarcho-syndicalist peasants, the deranged Black Knight with delusions of grandeur, and the Knights who say Ni. His loyal knights fair not much better. Michael Palin's Sir Galahad happening across a convent full of sexually frustrated young women led by Zoot and her twin sister Dingo, played by Python mainstay Carole Cleveland who is in fine form. As was part and parcel of the Python format, with the team stepping, into several sporadic roles, Terry Jones being superbly wet, as the effeminate Prince Herbert in desperate need of rescuing from an arranged marriage by his overbearing father, the King of Swamp Castle, played by Michael Palin. While John Cleese is in hilariously manic form as an abusive french knight, and effecting a Scottish accent to play Tim the Enchanter, giving an ""eccentric performance"" into the bargain.From a ferocious man-eating Rabbit to the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, it's knowingly ridiculous, and chock full of memorable lines, that along with the sketch series ""nudge nudge, wink, say no more"" and ""This is an ex-parrot""have become endlessly quotable, and become part and deeply ingrained in British Pop-Culture. However, as with anything Pythonesque, The Holy Grail is an acquired taste, and won't appeal to everyone due to the surreal avant-garde nature of its offbeat humuor, but for fans of the classic sketch series, it will be a source of extreme enjoyment. It may lack the stinging satire of Life of Brian and The Meaning of Life but makes up for its lack of this with its abundance of inspired lunacy which is knowingly quirky. Although it's something of a surprise, and thankfully so that the movie, like Life of Brian, didn't fall victim to the feverous backlash and controversy it received from religious groups and a certain Mary Whitehouse due to its amusingly contentious portrayal of God as a grumpy, pompous, blowhard. The Holy Grail is the epitome of off-the-wall British comedy at it's finest.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

excellent movie,"I love the holy grail. the first time i seen the movie i didn't really understand it but when i actually got around to watching the movie i found the weird humor funny and not over drawn. the humor in the movie is what brings the movie together. from the first battle (""it's just a scratch"") to the taunting from the french soldiers, then the knights who say Ni! i think it that movie is for people that have a weird sense of humor. It's definitely not a movie that u invite your family over to watch but yet a movie that u watch with your friends when u have nothing better to do and need a good laugh. i think that the movie is great, and believe it or not there are other people out there to that have never heard of the movie but are willing to sit down and watch it. it's a low budget movie but i think that that's what also makes the movie so good. me and my friend at work enact senses from the movie at work just to lighten the mood at a stressful work environment. i def. recommend this movie",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Not as good as Life of Brian, but worth watching","This Monty Python film is great, partly because it works on several levels; it works as a straight up typical Monty Python movie(which in itself ensures hilarity) and as a spoof of many of the old ""medieval times"" based films. The plot is pretty good, and less disjointed than that of other Monty Python creations, so if you're looking for a linear time line based film, then this might interest you. The plot does move along a little slowly, though, even for a Monty Python film(slower than Life of Brian, for example), and the film suffers a little under that. The jokes and sight gags make up for it, but it still does seem a little slow, especially on repeated viewings. The acting is good, as it typically is with Monty Python films. I can't really comment on the characters, but I guess they pretty much stay in character all through the film. The humor is good, but not as great as it is in Life of Brian, though that may be because I've seen it too many times. I don't know, I just wasn't really laughing at any point when I saw this. I knew that it was funny, and a few of the gags do stick in my mind as amusing, but when watching it I couldn't even muster up a slight chuckle. In fact, about an hour into the film, I was getting tired with the film, and hoped that it would end soon. I don't dislike the film, nor do I have anything against the humor, I just think I've grown tired with it. When it's not new and in-your-face anymore, it just loses impact, I guess. The film has plenty of entertaining sequences, and the gags and jokes are mostly quite good. It even has a few very memorable scenes, such as the the Black Knight scene, and the witch scene. The dialog is as sharp as the Python's dialog usually are, and there is more good dialog than there is in Life of Brian. All in all, a good Monty Python film, but just slightly inferior to Life of Brian. I recommend it to any fan of Monty Python, and fans of dark and silly humor in general. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
The Greatest pure comedy.,"No movie has even has or will even be as funny as Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Mostly because no film will ever commit to comedy as Monty Python and the Holy Grail has. Need and example well the third act end not in special but in a running joke that most people wouldn't give a second though. Monty Python and the Holy Grail is British humor at its absolute best. What we have here is an historical document of inestimable value, describing in no uncertain terms the terrible and beautiful times before AIDS. It's still the Holy Grail of crazy comedy. Nobody ever placed brilliance in the service of silliness quite the way the Python gang did. Monty Python and the Holy Grail is stuffed with both.

This movie BLOWS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is one of the worst movies ever, and it should not exist. The reason I watched it, is because I love comedy, and this movie is rated as one of the best comedies of all time, by several different sources. However, it is extremely boring, and not funny at all. One black knight scene in a forest is SOMEWHAT funny, but that's IT. Three or four minutes of funniness is not enough to carry the whole movie.For the record, I've noticed that I'm not alone, and there are MANY people here who strongly dislike this movie. I thought most of them did a good job at explaining WHY they don't like the movie.After all, it's not FAIR to say that a movie is bad, without explaining WHY... Yet, even though most of the people who gave this movie a bad rating, did a GOOD JOB at explaining why, their reviews STILL received a low percentage of being considered ""helpful."" This is probably because the people who DO enjoy this movie came here and rated those reviews as ""not helpful,"" just because they disagree with ANY negative opinions of this horrible dumb movie.So what I've decided to do, is give the movie a perfect rating (10 out of 10), even though it SUCKS! That way, its score will remain high, which will cause MORE people to watch the movie, and see for THEMSELVES how awful it is.In other words, since most people don't even RESPECT these (negative but ""honest"") reviews as being helpful, my advice is for everyone to see this movie for their self. That way, the AWARENESS will be raised, of how terrible it is, and maybe it can FINALLY shake off its over-rated status, not necessarily on this website, but in the minds of the PEOPLE.Remember, I didn't just say the movie was bad... I actually told you WHY it's bad, in my first paragraph (which, again is: because it attempts to be a comedy, even though it's not funny at all). But I know people are STILL going to consider my review to be ""not helpful."" I'm guessing that ZERO out of 100 people will find it helpful, and I really don't CARE!

"Best comedy ever?  Pretty much, yeah","I was fascinated into seeing this movie if only because of the sheer number of times it was quoted. I think it's somewhere between ""The Princess Bride"" (my favorite movie) and ""Star Wars"" in terms of the most terms that came from it. It's appropriately mentioned in Weird Al Yankovic's ""White And Nerdy"" and I remember kids in school talking about it. The weirdest thing is that I saw so many clips of this movie online that I had practically come close to seeing the whole thing. And you know what? Even with all those clips seen, this still was something I could not pass a single second of.What else is there to say about it? Every joke is just timed fantastically. It is a film which has withstood the test of time. I'm fairly certain it's the highest rated comedy on the entire Internet Movie Database. I still think it ranks second to ""Airplane!"" in terms of how funny it is. You can't get enough of this film. What's amazing is that every single joke just builds upon itself over and over until it finally finishes. This certainly seemed like a long film, if only because they were able to cram so many hilarious moments in this. You really have to think to get everything. This would have been the first movie to have a scene after the credits (the first is ""The Muppet Movie""), but it's just music where the credits should be. That's because the people making the credits were fired! Every single line is quotable. You have to pay attention to every little detail. Even if you've heard tons of quotes and scenes from this movie, you STILL have to see the whole thing to truly get the experience. Every single character in this movie is unforgettable. It's not just the Black Knight. You don't miss him because there's so many other one scene characters that are so wonderful. It's a film that truly reflects what you're thinking. In this one scene, I remember thinking that it was kind of pointless. Then the woman turned to me and asked if it should have been kept in. She read my frigging mind! I simply can not believe that Leonard Maltin gave this movie two and a half stars. How can anyone not like this?! Just when you think they've stopped with a certain joke, they pummel in more and more in a funnier manner.I lost count of how many times that one guy tried to sing. He DID eventually sing, but we didn't get to see it. Everything just escalates in the most wonderful way possible and it does manage to have a coherent story. I'm not the biggest ""Monty Python"" fan, but you can call me one after watching this. It's so wonderful description can't do it any justice.

The Holy Grail belongs unfortunately to the first sphere. (and suggesting to watch Space Balls instead of it, as I read in another comment, is not a solution: it is pure silliness as well!)Monty Python (so as Mel Brooks, who seems to have forgotten it ) knew very well how to make people laughing with surrealism, so they are not to blame for this forgivable and forgettable little sin.What is to blame is that we should have forgotten it, and on the contrary I found with surprise that this bad film ( I won't add about it anything more than the many not-satisfied comments say ) is underlined and appreciated.Of course I remain convinced about this thing: Monty Python knew how to make people laughing, and they surely ( in their own ) still know it: that's the reason why if they saw their movie now, I'm sure they would not laugh at all!",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Can nonsense be any funnier? Ni!,"I was in high school when I first saw ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"", so you can imagine how many times we'd describe a woman with huge . . . tracts of land. The movie sent me into a fit of giggles then and it's done so on every viewing since. Is the infantile subject matter the reason for the Grail's easy accessibility? ""Like of Brian"" possibly better shows the troupe's anarchy-fueled wit, but this is where they push it to the point of lunacy. Silly beyond belief, and I love every bit.We can all agree it's the most iconic of their movies. Everybody knows Monty Python by this movie: the Black Knight (""just a flesh wound""), the coconuts, the Knights who say ""NI!"", the rabbit.

Had me laughing for days,"Monty Python and the Holy Grail is one of the Monty Python's comedy troupe's most successful ventures. The film is absolutely hilarious from its ridiculous music numbers to its abstract animations. Scenes like the Knights who Say Ni and Tis but a scratch have become comedy legend.I very much see Monty Python and the Holy Grail as the movie continuation of Flying Circus. Rather than being a film in its own right, it is more a collection of stand-alone sketches and vignettes. Whilst this doesn't make the film bad, I think it can be confusing for first-time viewers.

I didn't even know the name of the movie at the time till I got to college and we rented it. I recognized it right away.

OMG this movie was so horrible!,"Everyone has been raging about how bad ass funny this movie was. Well I finally saw it the other day, and ugh, I had to turn it off halfway through.First of all, it appears shot on 16mm, with all the production value of a community college student film (zooms included).The jokes fall horribly flat. They kept using that ""coconuts for horses"" bit that got tired after about 2 minutes. The killer rabbit scene looked like some sort of slasher movie, way out of the realm of silly comedy. There are scenes with a lot of fog, which give the feel of a foreboding atmosphere, like a Braveheart like battle is about to break out, but this doesn't belong too well in a comedy flick.If you want to be entertained, watch Family Guy and Drawn Together instead.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

There are parts of this movie that are kind of boring, but it's still a good watch, especially the Camelot dancing scene.

Truly no other comedy has ever been able to do that for me.Incredible performances by the crew of Monty Python add to the wonderful humor of the entire thing, from the very first scene until the end.There is not one aspect of this movie that is not hilarious -- the ""horses,"" coconuts, the stupidity of the nights, the intelligent peasants who work at nothing, the satire of the Salem Witch Hunts, the wonderful cartoons, and who can ever forget the fearsome Knights Who Say Ni?  TIM the Enchanter, the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, the Great Beastly Rabbit?Anyone who can sit through this movie with a straight face must be blind deaf and dumb.

The Godfather of Parodies!,"I decided to start my challenge one day earlier, and what a movie to begin with!Monty Python and the Holy Grail is considered to be one of the greatest comedies of all time, and for a good reason.This low-budget film didn't just age well, but it sounds like it has been released 10 or maybe even 8 years ago, except it really makes you laugh out loud.This is how irony should be used, this is how breaking-the-fourth-wall should be done, and this is a Self-reflexive film that keeps being inventive and challenging throughout its running time.While its sharpness has been considerably blunted at some times, I was intrigued and hooked at every second of the movie.I didn't find the ending was rushed, rather I found it reasonably funny, if not completely satisfying.I'm really surprised at how Terry Gilliam take advantage of almost every silly situation or gag to reuse it later in the movie. He's a real genius!Simply, Monty Python and the Holy Grail is the godfather of parody films!(8.5/10)",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Amazing how this low-budget film still holds up!,"I just rewatched this movie and I can't believe how well it stands up to today's big budget, special effects laden galas.  I guess it just goes to show that good writers & actor/comedians make up for a low budget.  Of course director Terry Gilliam went on to bigger budget and special effects laden galas.  But this first effort is still quite remarkable both in the zany & irreverent storyline as well as the hilarious performances from the Monty Python crew.  Even with the surprise ending (according to Gilliam the money had run out so they had little choice but a quick finish) the comedy still holds up well and will hopefully continue down the years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Quite Possibly the Funniest Movie Ever Made,"For those of you who do not understand the unique, weird, and sometimes morbid Monty Python humor, do not see this movie. You are obviously not intelligent enough to see that you're not SUPPOSED to understand it. That is what makes it so funny. Completely random, irrelevant humor (e.g. the Knights Who Say 'Nee!', the castle Arrrgh, the political-minded peasants) makes this film stand above all others in terms of funniness.My God, how can a single group of men be this funny?

It's not dead yet!!  Hysterical fun,"When I first heard about this movie I balked.  Holy Grail?  It sounded like a bad Indiana Jones ripoff.  However, within the first 15 minutes I was on the floor laughing and holding my sides.  This movie has it all: violence, missing limbs, a chorus line of knights in full armor, bad french impersonators (with outraaaaageous accents!), violence towards cats, and a little sex (oral).If you like great battle scenes see BraveHeart or Episode I.  There's no great battles here.  In fact the fighters keep going while spewing blood and missing appendages without even noticing.  If you want romance then watch Casablanca.  This has a castle (The Castle Anthrax no less) with 5 score young blondes and brunettes who set out after the chaste Sir Gallahad.  If you like drama see Gone With the Wind...the most drama you'll find here is the cannibalistic consumption of some rather annoying minstrels, a terrifying construction paper monster, and an animator suffering a fatal heart attack.  If you want an intelligent flick, then rent Pi...the most intellectual stretching you'll find here is the mind taxing ""Gorge of Eternal Peril"" in which unfortunate souls must answer mind wrenching questions like ""What is your favorite color?""If you just want some good fun then this is the movie for you.

Comedic gold...,"It is difficult to comment on/review a comedy flick without being almost exclusively subjective; such is the nature of comedy. Some people just don't 'get' certain comedy acts. In terms of a classic comedy-fest such as MONTY PYTHON, I find it hard to believe that people still don't get comedies that are as irreverent and intelligent as MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL. Even almost 35 years after its release, the jokes remain fresh, and while they won't bring about the same spurts of laughter they do on first viewing, the viewer will undoubtedly chuckle at various instances, out of sheer admiration.The concept of such funny and gifted comedians such as John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, and Michael Palin (all playing multiple roles) spoofing British history/legend is simply hilarious, and their thick British accent just add to the humour.There are numerous sketches in MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL that will live long in the memory, and many have seen the film enough to be able to quote these scenes, line for line.MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL is comedic genius. Simple as that. 8/10. 3 stars (out of 4). It is difficult to give movies of comedic nature any higher than 3 stars due to their subjectivity. Should enter my Top 300 at 283.

You know how I really realized how cool this film was?  I studied in the Loire region (in France) my sophomore year of college.  One of our earlier group excursions was to a medieval castle called Chinon.  As we climbed up the tower and reached the lookout point someone from my group whispered, ""Fetchez la vache!""

The Monty Python group made a number of productions, several of which I own, but the rest pale in comparison to this masterpiece. I view this as a collection of superb individual skits that happen to form a ""story."" Each is so insanely hysterical that I can hardly believe that anyone had it in their mind to create it. From the banter between the French and the ""silly English kanigits,"" the rational of the ""scientists,"" to the mind boggling use of coconuts to simulate the sounds of a horse and other low-budget props make this movie an absolute classic.
