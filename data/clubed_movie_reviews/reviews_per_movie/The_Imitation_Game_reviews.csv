That 'The Imitation Game' was so acclaimed is hardly an enigma at all,"Alan Turing was a fascinating, complex person who deserves to be better known to the world. Likewise his story is important and deserves to be told rather than forgotten. Had high hopes for 'The Imitation Game', after hearing so many good things about it, and it ended up being one of my favourite films of 2014.That 'The Imitation Game' is historically inaccurate and has distortions didn't offend me as much as some reviewers, biographical dramas are notorious for this so it's come to be expected by me (not that that is meant to be an excuse). All that was wanted was a film that made me think, moved me, was well made and well acted. 'The Imitation Game' was all those things and more.It isn't perfect, the political elements are on the preachy side and there are a few strands that could have gone into more detail, Turing's sexuality should have gotten into more depth than it was.However, 'The Imitation Game' is exceptionally well made. It's immaculately photographed and has some of the best production design of its best, especially in the costumes. The direction allows the film to be absorbing, while the music score is often hauntingly beautiful and never intrusive.In terms of the script, 'The Imitation Game' does a wonderful job in provoking thought and providing emotional impact and nuances and fleshes the characters out with remarkable complexity. What could have been potentially dry treatment of the subject matter turned out to be fascinating, thrilling and very moving.Benedict Cumberbatch gives his best performance of a very solid career, an outstanding portrayal that won't be forgotten for years to come. Keira Knightley is a sympathetic confidante and Charles Dance is excellent as always as his superior. The supporting cast are without complaint.Overall, wonderful film and its acclaim is a long way from an enigma. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The Turing Test,"Alan Turing, Mathematician, Logician, Wartime Codebreaker and father of Computer Science. A great British Hero. A great hero in the fight against prejudice.This film tackles themes of prejudice against the feminine, against homosexuality and more generally against anyone who is different. How? By simply pointing out, using the example of Alan Turing and his colossal achievements, that it takes someone different to do something amazing.And an amazing story it is, packaged in a beautifully tight screenplay without a wasted scene, that keeps the audience fully engaged throughout. All the cast are on top form, in orbit around a stellar performance by Benedict Cumberbatch that layers humour, complexity, sexuality and the palpable frustration of a brilliant mind not quite able to communicate with his fellow humans.A film that depicts a man who perhaps fails the test he invented, that is now named after him. The Turing Test. Can he fool you that he is a real human being and not a super intelligent machine? The stress of playing that Imitation Game is set into every micro twitch of the central character.Should you go see it? No special effects. No interstellar spaceships. Why not wait for the download?Go see it! Because otherwise you would be missing the chance to see a most remarkable film, performed to perfection. A film about a story that matters, about events that changed history and simply about a man without whom you might not even be able to read this review on your Turing machine.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Compelling and Enthralling from start to finish.,"Truly excellent film and definitely Ocsar worthy material for both the film and the actors. The entire cast are amazing.As Cumberbatch says near the start of the film ""are you paying attention"". You should pay attention, Alan Turing deserves your attention, his story deserves to be told.I went to see this at the London Film Festival last week and I am going to be one of the first ones in the cue to see it when it comes out next month. It is an excellently paced and executed script that has you gripped from beginning to end. The whole audience were laughing and applauding and crying in places, including the man next to me who had to borrow a hankie from his wife.The film switches between the drive of the team of code breakers to solve the Enigma code, young Alan Turing and the events after the war that destroyed his life.It is truly heartbreaking in places, and Benedict Cumberbatch's performance as Alan Turing is outstanding. He really deserves an Oscar nomination for his performance.It has been a very, VERY long time since I enjoyed a film so much, that when I came out of the Cinema I wanted to turn right round and go back in and watch it again. A lovely script that had you switching back and forwards between tears and laughter.I know some wanted a more in depth and in detail look at Alan Turing's life and have commented frequently that this does no focus enough on his sexuality or the events after the war.In this case I think less is more, this film highlights the man and the mind. It shows us the genius that was destroyed by a society that was seriously homophobic. It brings to life the man behind the facts and we laugh at his interactions with his fellow code breakers and cheer as he proves his theories and our hearts break as we watch him try to cope after his court case.One of the best films I have seen in a long time. Go and see judge for yourself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Morten Tyldum's espionage thriller about Alan Turing is purely sensational with a performance for the ages by Benedict Cumberbatch...,"It took a little over 24 hours before I weighed in on my official thoughts on Morten Tyldum's The Imitation Game from The Weinstein Company. My initial reaction upon leaving the screening room was it was astonishing, a magnificent achievement that stands tall as one of the year's best movies. As the film continues to settle within my cinematic soul, this very well could be the best film of the year, anchored by a career best performance from the amazing Benedict Cumberbatch.Full disclosure, I'm fairly oblivious to European history and the heroes that had a hand in one of the deadliest wars in history. I've heard the name Alan Turing from high school and college but either didn't care enough to learn or have no recollection of his contributions. Minutes following the screening, Amazon.com got $15.82 from my bank account in order to read ""Alan Turing: The Enigma,"" the book in which screenwriter Graham Moore based the story upon. Telling the story of Alan Turing, a mathematician who in 1939 led a pioneer in cracking one of the most difficult codes in history. His contributions paved the way for essentially the way we exist now. However, Turing, who is a homosexual, has to wrestle with his secret in order to keep his status and his work years later.Masterfully told and encompassing an emotional complexity, Tyldum's film is both engrossing and disturbing. It has genius aspirations in which it wants to exist in the cinematic world. It's an impeccable thriller, taut and brilliant, exploring the horrors of war along with the choices that doom mankind for all eternity. Tyldum is methodical and precise in which he decides to unravel the story, Turing is one of the fallen heroes of our history and his story stands as one of the most tragic. Screenwriter Moore crafts a murky, dark, yet totally enjoyable spy film that stands taller than any James Bond film ever released. It's a sure-fire Oscar contender for several Academy Awards including Best Picture. They should feel so lucky to have the gumption to choose something this methodical and majestic.Benedict Cumberbatch continues to climb the ladder as one of the best actors working today. After impressive performances August: Osage County, 12 Years a Slave, and TV's ""Sherlock,"" this is the role that will make him a bonafide movie star. Oscar-winner or not, this will be looked upon like the greats such as Gene Hackman in The French Connection or any legendary 70's movie that you love today. Cumberbatch hones in on all of Turing's character flaws and good qualities that make him a real person. He constructs him from the toes up, inflicting mannerisms and behaviors that all ring true. He stimulates all the sensual beats that keep us fixated on a performance. I can't help but go back to someone like Joaquin Phoenix in The Master, who delivered a construction of epic proportions. Though based on a real person, the talented Cumberbatch ignites his own masterpiece performance. He follows the demons of Turing down to his bones. Unsure, arrogant, and dismissive to the world around him, Turing shows only what he must, what he chooses, and every once in a while, we get a front seat to his soul. Thank you Cumberbatch.The rest of the cast is completely on their game. It's probably a contender for the SAG Ensemble prize. Academy Award nominee Keira Knightley, as the feisty and fiery Joan Clark, is as loose and comfortable as I've ever seen her. She wears Joan like an old coat from the back of the closet. Remembering it fondly and seeing that it fits just perfect. She has all the things that make up an Oscar nominee; a scene that will likely bring you to tears, plenty of scenes that play as the comic relief in a dark tale, and being simply charming in every part of the film.I don't know when it's going to happen but the world needs to make Matthew Goode a mega-star. In his brief time on-screen, Goode makes his mark, becoming essentially a co-anchor with Knightley of the supporting players, showcasing a reason to give this guy his own leading role sooner rather than later. As our resident sleazy authority figure, Charles Dance shows that he's still got it. Mark Strong and Allen Leech also deliver memorable, fascinating scenes, both getting an opportunity to shine.Technical merits are no shortage of excellence on display. Oscar- winning Editor William Goldenberg (Argo) shows that tension is his second language. Cutting the film to perfection, and forcing your heart into throat, this espionage thriller succeeds for general audiences because of Goldenberg's efforts. It's something that anyone can seek out and get fully immersed into. Alexandre Desplat tacks another impressive composition to his already thick resume. With films like The Grand Budapest Hotel already in his arsenal, I assume this to be another Oscar citation in his future. Shot by the talented Oscar Faura, responsible for painting the canvas that was J.A. Bayona's The Impossible, he utilizes the standard brilliance of capturing a moment. Knows when to pull back and get close. Let's not forget the Production and Costume Design by Maria Djurkovic and Sammy Sheldon Differ. Those two will surely be mentioned for the rest of the film year.The Imitation Game is assertive and makes a serious claim as one of the best spy thrillers ever made. There are sub plots that all resonate and never feel forced. This will not only keep your tension level at a fever pitch but could leave you in tears to walk home with. It's a complete realistic view at the spy game that stands as one of the best films of the year and a performance for the ages from Benedict Cumberbatch. A captivating achievement that I'll likely remember for some time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
An Eminently Well-Made Biopic,"Brilliant adaptation of the story of Bletchley Park and the cryptanalysis team, ran by Alan Turing, that cracked the code of the German Enigma Machine during World War II. Featuring an outstanding starring performance from Benedict Cumberbatch as war hero Turning and supporting acts from a brilliant cast including Keira Knightley, Charles Dance and Mark Strong, 'The Imitation Game' is a powerful and eminently well-made biopic that illuminates the facts whilst respecting the story it is based upon. The English-language debut of 'Headhunters' director Morten Tyldum, this British World War II thriller is a highly conventional story about humanity that creates a fascinating character, anchored by a hypnotically complex performance.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Hello Best Picture frontrunner. Consider me satisfied.,"There is something appropriately mechanical about The Imitation Game. It has a theatrical rhythm and attention to detail that ticks like a clock. That's not to say that it's necessarily overly dry and hard to connect to, this biopic of the extraordinary and tragic mathematician and inventor of the digital computer, Alan Turing, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, is emotionally engaging and utterly endearing. With a slick exquisite script and an eclectic ensemble strong enough to deliver, it's an accessible film that although may feel familiar, is thoroughly refreshing, bringing laughter, tears and thrills. It will undeniably be a huge contender at the big awards this season, perhaps going all the way.Director Morten Tyldum's film follows Turing's journey to break the Enigma Code, the form in which the Germans communicated during WWII to conduct surprise attacks. He attempts it by building the first computer, a passion project of his that was frequently criticized for devoting so much Government time and money. He deals with a social ineptitude while also accepting his own homosexuality, which lead to unforgivable persecution and depression that caused Turing to take his own life. The film focuses on his life achievements rather than his demise, though it does explore that part of his life, if not illustrate it as much as it could have done.It's easy to root for Turing, even if his arrogance and standoffishness repel the other characters. Benedict Cumberbatch is a real crowd pleaser here. I've only seen him in short supporting roles such as last year's August: Osage County and 12 Years A Slave and I'm certainly quite impressed, if not quite as astounded. There's a very rehearsed quality about his performance, similar to Anne Hathaway's Oscar winning turn in Les Miserables. Every stutter and nuance feels perfectly placed rather than organic. But this isn't necessarily a turn off, it fits the tone of the film. He could go all the way to the Oscar but it depends on buzz and the competition.The highlight of the film is the writing by Graham Moore, adapted from Andrew Hodges novel 'Alan Turing: The Enigma.' It's not groundbreaking, but it has the right ingredients and the perfect recipe. Even if somehow it's the only film's nomination, it's still a frontrunner for the win in Adapted Screenplay. This will be a film known for 'ticking boxes,' but it does it in a way that all films should. It's economical without ever feeling like it's rushing or only scratching the surface. It constantly pummels the characters with adversity, presenting heart-wrenching moral dilemmas, particularly for Keira Knightley's Joan Clarke. It turns something complicated and bleak quite lighthearted, especially with the casual approach to war outside of moments of justified despair.Knightley will certainly get awards attention for her fine supporting role as Turing's counterpart. Her role may not be as meaty, lacking the highs and lows Cumberbatch has, but she makes the most of her relative sparing use, becoming the heart of the film. Thanks to her, their relationship is completely believable, given that Turing is a man who struggles with connecting to people, and the way she manages the choices her character is set upon is dealt with deft conviction. Charles Dance, Mark Strong and especially Matthew Goode are commanding side presences who bolster the film's charm. The titular 'imitation game' is essentially the Replicant test from Blade Runner, something Turing has practiced on himself. However, all the characters are human here, if with a confidence you only find in the movies.Instead of a linear structure, the film chooses flashbacks to flesh out the full story of Turing. It does seem a little extraneous to go back to school with him, but fortunately the focus of their objectives and the performances of the young actors make them worthwhile, as well as showing the origin of something that changed the world as we know it. The scale is further expanded with newsreel footage and scenes of the world at war, even if the special effects are relatively primitive compared to what can be achieved these days though that doesn't hold the film back as such. It's very easy to get suckered into films that convince you that you're watching one man change the world and The Imitation Game achieves that effortlessly.Although it's dense in character and plot, The Imitation Game flashes more on the surface than it has to offer beneath. Kinetic energy in the editing brings an instant gratification, especially in the edge of your seat sequences. There are liberties with the tone for such a somber event and protagonist that most likely doesn't reflect the honest emotions involved, but obviously it's easier to digest for audience. I was unsure at first, but then it had me under its spell. This also may be Alexandre Desplat's best bet at finally winning an Oscar. It adds to that whimsical cinematic tone, almost reminiscent on his work on Harry Potter sans the magic. It will certainly be warmly embraced in the mainstream. The film is poignant, but not powerful. Entertaining, but not enlightening.I'm content calling this the Best Picture frontrunner until further notice. The film feels like a combination of Argo, with the secrets and the camaraderie of the unit, and The King's Speech, with its Britishness and charming partnerships. It depends whether the Academy fall for the ambition of Christopher Nolan's Interstellar or the Chariots of Fire + The Bridge on the River Kwai formula of Angelina Jolie's Unbroken. Either way, The Imitation Game will belong amongst the most deserving winners, but the test of time remains to be seen. It's not like it'll be alone in that group. Nevertheless, with Queen Elizabeth II's pardon for Turing last year, there's never been a better time to educate the masses on his legacy that we use everyday.8/10edit: guess it isn't. Oh well. Boyhood and Birdman are better anyway.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
An instant classic,"A movie which oozes Britishness from every frame, The Imitation Game is an instant classic. Wartime Britain is depicted vividly, if a little caricatured, with an autumnal palette and a jaunty air.A true story, sympathetically told, with good performances all round and a stand-out Turing from the indefatigable Mr Cumberbatch. The young Turing is also extremely well realised by Alex Lawther.Meandering through Alan Turing's life since school until shortly before his death, the script demands your attention and regularly makes you smile.Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Well-made, but enragingly inaccurate","Let me start this review off by saying that the movie is mostly good. Cumberbatch has been able to show his acting skills and Knightley is great in her supporting role. The historical inaccuracies, however, are unforgivable.It is completely understandable that a movie based on a true story has to, in part, fictionalise some events, in order to be more exciting or moving. But what the filmmakers failed to understand, in this case, is just how extraordinary Turing's life was. Does one really need to distort the life of the man who created modern computer science as we know it and who was one of the most impactful people in the second world war?This movie is filled with inaccuracies from beginning to end. For example, Joan Clark wasn't hired with a crossword on a newspaper, the machine was never called ""Christopher"", Turing never hid his sexual orientation and there never was any reciprocal love with his friend Christopher Morcom. Many others can be found on the IMDb page. Most of these mistakes are relatively minor by themselves, but the sheer number of them feels manipulative in the extreme.The most blatant one, however, is the depiction of Turing as lacking social skills. In fact, most people who had the opportunity of working with him regarded him as a sociable man with a good sense of humour. Why did they have to portray him according to the typical Hollywoodian cliché of the mathematician? If, for any reason, a filmmaker believes that a socially inept protagonist is more compelling, then they should tell a fictional story, instead of abusing an actual lived experience to push a stereotypical image.I will give ""The Imitation Game"" credit for telling an important story and, if you want to see a well-crafted drama set during the second world war, watch this movie, by all means. But if you'd like to discover more about Turing's life, please just read more about him. To think that Turing's impact hasn't been recognised for decades and what made him known to a wide audience is a woefully inaccurate movie is saddening. Sorry Alan, you deserved better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The best British movie I've saw in a long time!,"I went to see this movie at a screening. I have to admit, I went into this movie not knowing anything about Alan Turing and Enigma, but I love movies based on true events; especially those about the history of our country.Despite not knowing anything about Mr. Turing or the events of his life, as soon as I left the movie theater, I went home and looked him up and spent the next few hours learning of his life, everything he did for this country and the invention of what we now call 'the computer'.I want to start by saying that Benedict Cumberbatch in this movie is outstanding. He plays Alan Turing perfectly; his accent, his movements and just the way he plays the character on screen is beautiful. I can honestly say that this is the performance of his career!The movie focuses on different aspects of his life: it shows him and his team trying to break Enigma, it shows Young Turing during his time at boarding school, and the events after the war.There's a quote at the beginning of the movie: ""are you paying attention?"". Throughout the movie, that's what I did. It's all that I could do because the story and the acting kept my eyes glued to the screen and I couldn't take them away. It's emotional, it's exciting and it is truly heartbreaking in some moments. It was a very comedic movie, too. There were some scenes that had me in fits of laughter and that's what makes it a beautiful script; despite the movie being based on the darkest days of World War 2, they added comedy into it which brought the movie alive.I remember getting home and after researching Alan's life, I wanted to go back to the cinema and watch the movie again. It's rarely that happens to me but when this comes out in November, I will be straight to the cinema and purchasing a ticket to watch it.I've heard reviewers mentioning that this film doesn't focus enough on Turing's homosexuality. Now, be that as it may, it focus' enough on the subject. Remember: this movie is about his mind, about the man himself. He was a genius!This is the best British movie that I've saw in a long time, and it's probably one of the best movies that I've ever had the pleasure of watching, period.I would recommend going to watch this movie when it comes out because it will take you into the world of Mr. Turing and the struggles and successes he made in his short life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Fine acting but an highly inaccurate story,"The story of the breaking of the German ciphers during WWII is a significant one, deserving of an accurate telling. The story of Alan Turing, a key member of the team that developed the methods and machines that broke those ciphers is an important one, also deserving of an accurate telling.""The Imitation Game"" is neither of these films. The story told by this film is watchable, Cumberbatch renders Turing sympathetically and, somewhat to my surprise, Knightley takes the thinly written role of Joan Clarke and turns it into something with a fair bit of heft. However, this film's story takes such liberties with the facts that it really cannot be recommended. This is *not* how the German ciphers were broken and it is not even a reasonable depiction of Turing's life, particularly so when it comes to the atrocious way he was treated after the war.You will not find Harold Keen or Gordon Welchman in this film, the writers preferring to insinuate that Turing was wholly responsible for the design and building of the bombe machines (except that Hugh Alexander is credited with the idea for improving their working that was actually Welchman's). However, you will find a Soviet spy in Turing's hut when in fact he did not work there. I could go on and list other inaccuracies.If you are unaware of the stories of Enigma and Turing, you may find this a quite interesting film to watch. If you are aware of these stories I think you may find it difficult to swallow the gross misrepresentations of both.I consider that filmmakers, when depicting real people or events, have a responsibility to tell the truth and not distort things simply for dramatic effect. When this responsibility is ignored the filmmakers have decided to, in effect, spread lies in the name of entertainment. ""The Imitation Game"" may be entertaining but it makes this dismal mistake and cannot be recommended.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Excellent,"This is THE movie for anyone who wants to learn about the birth of all modern computing and cryptography. It also provides a deep commentary on the ignorance of people who hate those who do not fit in. I wish the film could have gone into more detail about Alan Turing after the war when his deepest personal struggles were in full force. However, for a theatrical film it would have been far too long. This film illustrates how far we have come as a society in terms of accepting gay and lesbians and their contributions to society. I will not spoil the film but for the cypherpunks out there you will be a little uneasy if you compare the MI-6 tactics to those of today's NSA and other three letter agencies that spy on our every digital move. All in all a brilliant film with great actors that will move your hearts and minds.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Brilliant performance,"Whenever I watch films where it's based on a true story, I typically tend to not delve into the story itself and watch the film for its main purpose. Entertainment. I thought I'd quickly whack this in here, because I saw some negative reviews because it was a little bit inaccurate.The film itself I thought was brilliant. It was a wonderful performance from Benedict (never used that word to describe acting before which speaks volumes) and he carried the film in the parts where not a lot was going on.The plot itself was interesting and kept you in suspense throughout and it had great characters that were all likeable and kept you invested throughout!My only real problem I had was that when they finally figured out the code, the film kind of dragged. All tension was gone from the film and you're left with 20 mins or so of just wrapping up stuff and dragging scenes on that didn't need to be, so I got a touch bored towards the end. But other than that it was a really enjoyable watch and for someone who wasn't really familiar with the true story I found it educational also, which is a nice bonus.But yeah, it's definitely a film I'd recommend. 8/10 from me!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Disappointingly inaccurate,"Good film, would have been an excellent film. However the shockingly re-writing of history and the glaring movement from fact to fiction rather took the edge off it for me.Might as well have changed the character names as well. Should have had the disclaimer any resemblance to actual events and persons very slim.At the end of the film you have the feeling that the film has been adapted to fulfil clichés. The computer is re named christopher and we are meant to think that this is representing Alan Turing lost love!Why, oh why could it not have been closer to reality. At the end of the day it leaves you with the slight feeling that you have been conned.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
An Imitation of LIFE... One of the Most Outrageous Cases of Injustice Ever Brought to the Screen,"In a Perfect World...Nothing Like what occurs in Imitation Game could have ever happened. As this review is being written, the Presentation of this year´s Oscars is but a scant couple of hours away!It is very easy to understand why Benedict Cumberbatch is one of the front-runners for Best Actor. As Alan Turing, a Cambridge professor who was anything but SIMPATICO, the British actor manages to inspire a great deal of audience empathy for a character who, had he been represented by a different actor, probably would not have been able to establish such a solid viewer connection!....Now, under no circumstances, does my review purport to claim the film is 100% accurate as to every detail depicted! Of course not! Any cinematic endeavor is, by definition, a dramatazation of the events.Certainly... IMITATION is no exception! It is a story that is INSPIRED by real events. Not intended to be taken in as a DOCUMENTARY!As to the lead character´s faults or his sexuality, almost anyone who sees this film would testify as to its rather low key presentation and that is definitely rather discreet, by 21st Century standards!

After all, isn´t that the essence of what CINEMA is SUPPOSED to be all about???10**********... A truly rewarding and outstanding Film!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The Ingenious Genius,"This is a story about a saviour. An un-sung hero of World War II; Alan Turing, a genius British mathematician who secretly worked tirelessly to decode the German 'Enigma' code within the now famous Hut 8 of Bletchley Park. Remarkably, his breakthroughs in cryptography and technological achievements are still realized today in the form of 'Turing Machines' – to me and you, these are now called computers.We first meet Alan after the events of World War II within the confines of an interrogation room, here accused of the then indecency of his homosexuality. It is here we are transported into Alan's world, where when questioned about his work at Bletchley Park does he oblige, peeling back the seemingly cold-blooded, narcissistic veneer with a detailed narrative on his work, leading a team of linguists, mathematicians and problem solvers.Alan's clinical, precise and unrelenting witty focus to achieve the impossible begins to alienate his team mates and superiors, which ultimately creates a rift in support of Alan's grand plans to build a cutting-edge machine to help decipher the infamous German code. It is here we see the real Alan – the exposed Alan, in which his absolute genius forgoes his interpersonal skill set. This is a challenge in itself for Alan to embark upon, and it's a real heart- warming treat to watch how his relationships develop with his peers to an ultimate conclusion of sacrifice, friendship and mutual respect. Benedict Cumberbatch ultimately lays bare the man that Alan Turing was; a real man of warmth and soul that the numerous writings and texts after Alan's death in 1954, fails to capture.For a man who struggles with his words of affection toward others, we observe his capacity for compassion when he meets fellow mathematician Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley), who herself is struggling with social hierarchy and her place as a woman in the 1940s on Alan's secretive team. It is not long before we see the genius of her work as she proves not only to play a pivotal role in the collaboration to break the 'Enigma' but she also provides Alan with moral guidance and support through his time working alongside her at Bletchley Park.It is apparent by the film's sombre conclusion that the somewhat brief and seemingly convenient engagement to Joan actually had a profound impact in Alan's life. Kiera Knightley's portrayal of Joan Clarke is certainly her most refreshingly spunky performance of late, bringing emotional weight to the tale of Alan Turing. She is essentially the yin to his yang and not for Alan's choice of sexuality (itself illegal in the mid-1900s), would they be the perfect team and companion for one another. It's delightful but ultimately fateful to watch on screen as the story begins to unfold and race towards its conclusion.It is fitting that the breakthrough in cracking the German's code comes courtesy of an epiphany of love – sometimes love makes us do things we don't always intend.It is emotionally trying to see the eventual outcome of Alan and his teams' work at Bletchley Park be ultimately foreshadowed by the politics and implications of Alan's homosexuality.Based on the book; Alan Turing: The Enigma, by Andrew Hodges, Director Morten Tyldum makes his English language debut here with none of the frantic mania that came with Headhunters, but with a more structured and methodical approach that flits between Alan's youth, middle-age and his work during World War II.The screenplay by Graham Moore is crafted with beautiful complexity and precision, gleefully layering in key events from Alan's life, compounding the reality of his tragic end – the relentless bullying at boarding school, his fondness of a fellow student that ultimately ends in tragedy, the constant pressure of hundreds if not thousands of lives lost every day, the discovery of a Russian double agent embedded within Hut 8, all whilst bearing the weight of the consequences of his sexuality, itself the focus of an investigation after the fact in the 1950s in an attempt by a keen detective (played by Rory Kinnear) to act on a Policeman's hunch, after investigating a reported break-in of Alan's place of residence.The simple but terrific score by Alexandre Desplat elevates the emotive narrative; and compounds into reality, the harsh realisation of war.The Imitation Game is the perfect platform in which to showcase the true acting chops of Benedict Cumberbatch in a performance that will remain very memorable indeed and a highlight of his career – a front runner for the Best Actor gong for sure. The best of British cast, including Kiera Knightly, Mark Strong and Charles Dance all prove to be very able in their supportive roles, not forgetting Alex Lawther in his breakthrough role of young Alan Turing also doing fine work here.Whilst not absolute perfection on all accounts – some pacing issues mid-way through; and jarring usage of CGI depicting sequences on the front line aside, this is clearly a passion project of everyone involved, and one that I can firmly say that without a doubt was very interesting, surprising and emotionally engaging to watch. If this film brings the story of Alan Turing (and rightfully so) to the masses, then I'm in full support.

The Enigmatic Man,"The British Official Secrets act prevented me as a kid growing up about Alan Turing. I would certainly have liked to know about him in my formative years on many levels. Over a 100 years after his birth he's a role model for gay geeks everywhere, but in his lifetime he would not have been known beyond his field of Mathematics.Benedict Cumberbatch plays the enigmatic man Alan Turing who many consider the founder of computer science. He was also a tortured gay man in those days when sodomy laws were strictly enforced. A respected professor of Mathematics he volunteers for the war effort. Not satisfied with how codebreaking efforts were going he goes right to the top and the sheer brass and effrontery persuade Winston Churchill to put this man in charge.I doubt Winston Churchill knew much more about what Alan Turing was talking about than I would now. But sometimes genius will out in just the way it's presented. I only wish we had gotten to see Churchill's reaction to Turing's now famous letter.As we well know now with what has been declassified how Turing and his picked crew broke the Nazi code and with some well used and specific intelligence at propitious moments we were able to win the war in Europe. Part of that crew is Keira Knightley who wins a battle for feminism to be accepted in this all male bastion.Keira and Ben's scenes have some real emotion to them. He confesses he's gay and she would still like to marry him as fascinated as she is by his sheer intellect. Cumberbatch made the right decision as so many gay men today still make the wrong one. He decides that marriage will just spread the heartache he has in not being able to live openly and proudly with whom he loves. For her role Keira Knightley got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress.When different players play the same individual at different stages of life I've thought that some recognition is due. In flashback scenes to Turing's prep school days we see the understated but beautifully played romantic involvement of Alex Lawther as young Turing and Jack Bannon as Christopher Morcum. Those two juveniles are nothing short of magnificent in what they do with the part. Young Morcum's death while still in prep school was a secret heartache he carried for the rest of his life.The Imitation Game got several other Oscar nominations including Best Picture and took home one Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. The saddest thing about Alan Turing is that he's one of a handful of people who ever existed of whom it could be said he bent the course of history and in his life he could receive no recognition for it. In fact we do see what did happen to him post World War II. Now his nation and the world can appreciate him for what he was and what he did.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
This movie was masterfully done.,"Great film about a not so well known part of WWII, Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent. I really liked this movie. it was pretty interesting to watch. One of the best movies I have ever seen.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Great acting,"What the film lacks in my opinion is a seriously constructed drama. Although the film carries a certain amount of tragedy, somehow I couldn't managed to get deeper convened with the characters and complications they experiencing on a daily basis. Maybe it's because of the large number of one-dimensional characters. I'm not entirely sure. Although the script has some glitches, what definitely sells this movie and makes it worth a multiple of view is the brilliant performance of Benedict Cumberbatch. This brilliant British actor amazes us in the role of a brilliant but tortured genius. Because of him all the other elements of the film gets thrown in the background. The spectrum of emotions he gives is great, Benedict contribute so much that the film raises because of him a whole new level.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Good but fanciful story, missed opportunity","Alan Turing was a real genius, but he did not design by himself a machine to break the Nazi Enigma message encoding machine during WWII.Some things in the film are correct, and others are wildly fanciful and even insulting to the memory of the people at Bletchley park and elsewhere who made breaking Enigma possible.The film remains very good, engaging, well acted and full of suspense and drama. I feel a great opportunity was lost, though, to tell the real story of this codebreaking effort, which heroically and decisively shortened the war considerably without firing a single shot.For this, read a book. A great one: ""Alan Turing, the Enigma"" is very good.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Perhaps the best biopic you will ever see,"During World War II, the Nazis used a complex coded communication method that reset every 24 hours, making it seemingly impossible to decode. Alan Turing, a socially-handicapped Cambridge professor and legitimate genius, led a team of brilliant mathematicians whose mission was to crack the code and win the war. The Imitation Game is sure to become a classic in the coming years, as it's one of the best biopics you will ever see.Benedict Cumberbatch (BBC's Sherlock) knocks it out of the park with his highest profile leading role to date. He earned an academy award nomination for his focused, at times funny, sympathetic, and tragic portrayal of Alan Turing. The Cambridge professor may have gone on to become the father of computer science, but that doesn't mean he was easy to get along with, or even likable. His unconventional methods and behavior drew the ire of his fellow mathematicians, in addition to the stern and intimidating Commander Dennison (Charles Dance, Game of Thrones). Eventually, he tempers his arrogance and wins over his colleagues (the commander excluded), who (contrary to his initial belief) provide invaluable assistance in breaking the Nazi code and winning the war. Turing's time at Bletchley Park is fraught with conspiracy, agonizing decisions, betrayals, secrets, and the end of his story is sure to leave the audience legitimately heartbroken.To give each member of the supporting cast individual praise would take up too much space in this review, but it's safe to say that all cast members, especially Turing and his friends/colleagues, have excellent chemistry and are each given ample time to shine. Aside from Charles Dance, the most notable supporting roles come from Allen Leech (Downton Abbey) and Kiera Knightley (Pirates of the Caribbean). Leech nails his first major film role as John Cairncross, a mathematician on Turing's team who shows his loyalty to him right off the bat and sympathy for his struggles. The feisty Joan Clarke is seemingly the best of both worlds (a genius and socially adept), but Knightley's portrayal, while delightful, may not quite convince the audience she had a double first in mathematics at Cambridge.Despite covering a complex and intellectual topic, the film gracefully glides between the main story and two other plots. Thanks to its Oscar-nominated editing, The Imitation Game keeps audiences equally invested in the main story, Turing's troubled time at boarding school, and when he's under investigation for ""indecency"" (the term used when homosexuality was illegal) a few years after the end of World War II.The Imitation Game is possibly the best film of 2014. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The true review,"This film is incredible I couldn't fault anything about it the acting was absolutely amazing from the whole cast, Benedict Cumberbatch acts so well which takes the film to a whole other emotional level . The story of Alun Turing and the other cryptographers was told incredibly well, as previously mentioned I can't fault this film however I did rate it a 8.5 because generally that's what I rate these sorts of films but it doesn't mean this film isn't amazing and it doesn't mean you shouldn't watch it, however the ending leaves you with a sort of melancholy feeling you know like the feeling you have after reading a really good book and then you realise it's over you've read all of the pages you could and I gues in this case you've watched all of the frames of a true story that couldn't turn out in any other way but you wish it could for one character in particular, I won't spoil any more than that.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Sometimes it is the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.,"Sometimes it is the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine. This statement is made three times during the film at the most poignant times in it. This is a well crafted film and though the film is essentially based on Alan Turing it doesn't overshadow the fact that Alan Turing cracked the Enigma code with a small team that helped win the war. It is also difficult to imagine that once upon a time in history to be a homosexual was a death sentence and it highlights also that woman were not allowed to go for or to do what was considered a mans job. I go to the cinema to be entertained, thrilled, shocked try and guess the ending to a thriller or to be educated. The film accomplishes most of that; but its the revelation that one of the Worlds greatest mathematicians and greatest minds at the time whose commitment to breaking Enigma and pioneered the modern age of the computer was treated so appalling in the end and it is a story that must be told and it is told here without patronising its audience. And Joan Clarke (played by Kiera Knightley maybe not as convincingly as the rest of the ensemble cast ) highlights just how hard it was for a woman with intelligence and Alan Turing's' vision to establish herself as an equal- Today it is almost incomprehensible that we would treat people with such disdain and so callously because of their sexual orientation or indeed women as badly - although women are still not treated as equal in some quarters-",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Conventional Treatment,"The Imitation Game is half a historical movie that takes place in the agency side of WWII and half a biography of Alan Turing. The movie introduces with a mission that sets up a plan of building a technology to crack a code while the rest is basically a study of what kind of a man Turing truly is. While both sides are quite gripping in its own distinct interest, the movie rather picks some conventional choices in its storytelling, making it sort of underwhelming and predictable, but its skilled direction and a terrific performance by Benedict Cumberbatch surpasses that fact, thankfully made most of it worth it.The first hour focuses on how they would break the Enigma code, while it teases some flashbacks where Turing learned his encoding skills. It normally tells this story as a mission out of luck, with a team who are only given little chance to succeed. But there is some sense of complexity on their task, like how the government doubts their promise, or how difficult for Turing to get along with his colleagues, etc. And it structures these scenes pretty well, but how the film resolves each of these events does often feel breezy. The next step of the story is the persecution of Turing's sexuality, which completely shifts the theme. It went from an argument of never underestimating one's capabilities in spite of his alienated attitude, to a sentiment about being tolerant with homosexuals. Both of them tell a good message, but the last one just randomly becomes the entire center of the film.It just lacks enough concentration, the movie just moves and changes too soon before it actually becomes engaging. Fortunately, it's still a decently crafted film. The pacing is consistently handled, there is also a strong production work. Looking around the structure is simply stunning. The actors did what they have to do, the best of them is obviously Cumberbatch who instantly makes the character interesting while you may also get connected with his eventual personal troubles. He's backed up well with Matthew Goode and Keira Knightley, even though there isn't much about their characters, same with other solid supporting like Mark Strong and Charles Dance who are mostly at the background.The Imitation Game still holds a fascinating story which remains itself as a good film. It just needs more depth; it needs more breathing for suspense at their mission, as well as it needs more exploration at the sudden shift of Turing's deeper character study. The film just easily jumps into the conventional celebration of the man's work and its effects to the war. But even with all of the contrivance, it's still easy to follow how this historical moment happened, even though its storytelling is not as groundbreaking as Turing's achievement. But to be sure, it clearly didn't rob enough of what makes it interesting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A bit overrated,"First of all, you may notice that I am french, so if you want to criticize my review, please do so on the content, and not on grammatical errors or how I write. I am not a movie critic, and my writing style is not the best, but I just love watching movies and criticizing stuff.So I watched The Imitation Game two days ago and I must say, it wasn't bad at all. The problem is, it wasn't great either. I went into this movie with high expectations, because of it's great reception and its 8 academy awards nominations, and I believe this was the biggest reason for which I found this movie to be disappointing. Now don't get me wrong, the movie was objectively really good, and I loved the fact that thanks to this movie, one of my favorite underrated scientist of all time would finally get some more recognition, but maybe the fact that I knew Alan Turing beforehand ruined the experience for me. I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatch, and when I heard he would be playing Alan Turing, I was really excited. And boy did he disappoint me. His acting looked stiff and during the entire movie, I had the impression I was watching the 1950 version of Sheldon Cooper from The Big Bang Theory, which really upset me. I can imagine that Alan Turing could have been this anti-social stuttering genius, but to me, it looked like the director wanted to turn him into this lovable dorky thats-just-how-he-is unconventional idiot/genius just to make the crowds love him, and it apparently worked. Cumberbatch's inconsistent stuttering and expressionless face made the fist 80% of the movie borderline unbearable to me. The music didn't make it better, quite the contrary. It had nothing special, and at some points seemed rather out of place. I caught myself regularly checking how much longer this movie was since it seemed to have no end. HOWEVER, I gave this movie a 7 out of 10 because even though I was really upset seeing Keira Knightley (I didn't like her as an actress) she actually surprised me. Her acting was impeccable and natural, and actually made me like her a lot more. The second point I wanted to praise was the ending. Now I am not going to spoil anything, but Cumberbatch's performance at the end turned from meh to marvelous. He was so convincing that he got me to completely tear up.Even though the ending was great, I did not like this movie. But I can imagine that people would like it, since (I repeat myself) it is objectively a great movie, even though I feel it is a bit overrated. I have the greatest admiration for Alan Turing and his work, so I am quite happy that the movie got such a large audience and so, that this genius finally got the recognition he deserved.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Very good film... but.,"As some reviews all ready have very thoroughly explained, this movie takes HUGE liberties when it comes to altering the true story. Personally, I don't really understand why. Allan Turing was still a mathematical genius, a hero and a very intresting person, well worthy to have his story told, without them also changing history so much. I don't understand, what's so wrong about the truth? Also, they dumbed down to movie plenty, I think. At least once they could have given some sort of explanation on how the machine actually works. Other than that, it was still a good film and I enjoyed it, much credit to Cumberbatch performance but it was also a nice picture in many other aspect and an interesting story to be told. And an important story to be told also. I just got a bit dissapointed when I looked up some actual facts afterwards and understood that much of the story for the film had been altered or completely made up. Still, in its essence, I believe it still holds true in many ways.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Predictable and dull,"Cumberbatch played Alan Turing well, but I felt he was given almost same persona as he plays in Sherlock. His mannerisms were almost identical. This is where most of the 'laughs' in the film come from and as I had seen Sherlock before hand 70% felt like dull repeats.The fact that nobody was friends with him just reminded me of Sherlock - this was not true in real life. Secondary, the plot was almost identical to every other movie about a genius - Turring was played as unrecognized and an oddball. The plot also felt too smooth edged, all the twists were predictable and the events were too coincidental to be believable. The spy subplot was unnecessary and added nothing to the story. This may sound pedantic, but some parts seemed out of place for the historical setting: the detective's too modern haircut and lines such as ""ohh my gosh"" which really brought me out of the story. Finally, the ending scene was unnecessary and should have cut straight to the ending lines. Speaking of which, the last line inferred that the two things mentioned were linked, but they were in fact months apart. This is an example of the film's unreasonable twisting of facts in order to give the plot and conclusion this type of film needed. Should you wish to find out the real story of Alan Turing I suggest you google it as this film is not very accurate and unfairly stereotypes Turring.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Superb plot,"Amazing biopic and outstanding cast with Benedict Cumberbatch leading the race. He demonstrates in this piece why he is one of the greatest actors of his generation. Great pace and the film does not let up until the final moments. Both captivating and heart-rending. Definitely an award worthy film. The way the film tackles the different themes of sex, morality, ethics and patriotism left me interrogating myself. The dialogue is taut and the action constrained but very intentional and the actors really do an amazing job of guiding us along the story. Each character was very distinct with their own motivations and truths (and this is not necessarily a universal concept). I applaud writer and director alike for the singular vision that was brought to the fore.

The day Cumberbatch came of age.,"The British Government essentially killed Alan Turing.The man who invented what we now consider the 'computer' and he may have saved 14 million people from death because of his contribution, sorry vast contribution, to the foreshortening of the Second World War through his invention of the Enigma code breaking machine. Churchill thought so.But, the trouble is, you see, Alan Turing was a homosexual. And the British Government (like many today did not like homosexuals). Homosexuals in the post war years were lepers of society. So the British Government chemically castrated him.Alan Turing was most likely also a sufferer of Aspergers Syndrome.He was, in every sense of the word, a genius.He was not a likable man because to make real, substantial change sometimes eschews popularity. He was not popular.It's a dream role for an actor of substance. That actor is Benedict Cumberbatch.At the time of writing Cumberbatch has seven movies in production, new episodes of the BBC's Sherlock and a couple of episodes of The Hollow Crown as Richard III as work in progress. It would seem reasonable to assume from this that he is a man in demand.Why?Because he is a brilliant actor. And this is his time. This is most certainly his movie. Yes, he has good support from Keira Knightley, Allen Leech, Matthew Goode and especially Mark Strong, as his 'boss'. Charles Dance moves on from his movie idol roles into the baddie spotlight and carries it off effortlessly. But make no mistake. This is ALL about Benedict Cumberbatch.Biopics are often easy meat because they can be imitation games.But who knew Turing?In Cumberbatch's hands he's a clean sheet and as the movie develops he progresses from a no name to an absolute hero.Who cares about Alan Turing? At the start; maybe only the informed. By the end; we all do. It builds to a highly emotional climax that is handled with great skill by breaking Norwegian director Morgan Tyldum. You probably don't know his work. I don't I'm afraid; but I'm keen to.This is great cinema. Please go see it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Illuminating overlay,"What an absolutely riveting watch this is! There is some superb acting in this imagined story giving an explanation of Turing's role in the code-breaking efforts at the secret Bletchley Park. Even Cumberbatch's bright blue eyes give us a story - pinched pupil's at the moment he 'separates' from Joan Clarke (Knightley), for example. Thankfully, Knightley gives us a better performance than she has done for some time, though, some dialogue could have been better formulated. I might also quibble with the less than believable hat-less and cap-less characters at times - Charles Dance's luminous white bonce should often have been under a hat and, there should have been more Brylcream in evidence. But, hey, this is a really engaging film. Motives, scenes and quotes quite likely filched from other stories are used to set the scene - and set the scene they really do. We don't necessarily have to believe them though. Turing is, in this presentation, given an Asperger-like tic - well, true or not, it helps this particular story along very well.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Can you crack the code?  ""Bme uif Ptdbs hpft up...""","Few injustices in the world have equalled that meted out to Alan Turing. Where would the world be today without him? He can justly be considered to be the father of modern computing, and yet as a homosexual he was prosecuted for gross indecency, chemically castrated and his genius thrown away by a seemingly uncaring and ungrateful nation that drove him to early suicide. (God bless Her Majesty, for giving Turing an official posthumous pardon last Christmas).Such is the distressing true(ish) story told in ""The Imitation Game"" starring the omnipresent Benedict Cumberbatch. The film largely centres on his contribution to the war effort at Bletchley Park in decrypting encoded German communications through the Enigma machine – a fearsomely complex device for randomising messages. I say ""true(ish)"" since having done a bit more digging into the background on this, the Imitation Game is not quite the story it purports to be. There is a muttered line by Cumberbatch about the ""contribution of the Poles"", but in reality it seems that the early Enigma machines were actually first cracked by some of the leading Polish mathematicians (notably Jerzy Rozycki, Henryk Zygalski and Marian Rejewski). The Bletchley Park team only came in to assist when the German's added a new layer of complexity to the machines. Never let the facts get in the way of a good story though: this simplification of the story probably helps a lot.Turing is portrayed – no doubt fairly accurately – as a spiky, anti-social and generally unlikable individual, despised by his co-workers until such time as his genius starts to earn him respect. His comrade in the Bletchley Park branch of 'Asperger's Anonymous' is the equally spiky mathematician Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley), who he recognises an intellectual kin-ship with. Their rather unorthodox relationship, given his sexual orientation, forms another key element of the film.Flashing backwards and forwards (without warning) between three time periods: Turing's unhappy school-days; the Bletchley Park war years; and his dogged pursuit by a 50's cop (Rory Kinnear), a story that you might expect to be a fairly dry biopic zips along with enormous vim. Whilst this is a film that many critics will turn their noses up at as a 'crowd-pleaser', you can guarantee that it is one that will make the BBC Bank Holiday film schedules regularly for the next 50 years! On the acting side, the cast is excellent. Cumberbatch must be a strong candidate for at least a BAFTA if not an Oscar for his portrayal of Turing. There must always have been a danger with this casting of him flipping into ""Sherlock"" mode, given the similarity of the characters, and yet you rarely equate the two performances which is quite a trick to pull off. Knightley is also excellent in a 'terribly British' role. Charles Dance, Mark Strong (a 'goody' for once!) and Downton's Allen Leech all deliver excellent supporting performances. But particularly effective is Matthew Goode (""A Single Man"", ""Stoker"" but perhaps best known to TV viewers as Finn Polmar in ""The Good Wife"") who is a magnetic big-screen performer and who should be getting more leading actor roles.Also outstanding is young Alex Lawther as Turing the schoolboy who delivers a memorable performance in a challenging role bringing to mind the screen presence of Haley Joel Osment in ""The Sixth Sense"": a young man to watch for the future.The decidedly non-English director is Norwegian-born Morten Tyldum, who directed the outstandingly black but entertaining ""Headhunters"" back in 2011.Also likely for BAFTA recognition is the Art Direction in this film (Production Design by Maria Djurkovic), which paints a nicely nostalgic vision of war-time Britain, and the costume design by Sammy Sheldon. The effective music score is once again by Alexandre Desplat – - does that man ever sleep? By the way, the title – ""The Imitation Game"" – comes from a famous paper that Turing wrote in 1950 and refers to what is now known as the ""Turing Test"" – the test to see if a user can distinguish whether the 'person' they are communicating with is human or machine. (This has a nice double meaning in the film given that Turing is imitating being a heterosexual for legal reasons). In many ways in chronicling the history of gay rights in the UK, this film makes a nice 'prequel' to another of this year's great films ""Pride"" – whilst Turing's prosecution for gross indecency was in 1952, the last public prosecution of this type was in 1967 with Pride being set only 18 years later. We live in more civilised times, thank God.You can tell that we are rapidly approaching the awards season again by the quality of the films on offer. This is a great watch, particularly for a slightly more mature audience that values acting, story and emotion over bangs and special effects.

A Biopic that Didn't Quite Work for Me,"We saw The Imitation Game on opening night and for some reason it was quite an underwhelming experience. Maybe we were on an euphoric high after back to back solid films and our expectations were sky high. I do recognized aspects of it which were exceptional but they couldn't cover what I thought was a very safety glove affair with not much depth, especially for Alan Turing later years. So I didn't want to write anything unless someone does firstBenedict Cumberbatch is marvelous to watch. In all his noteworthy roles, he plays these savant type characters with a serious lack of social etiquette coupled with arrogance. Here he essentially plays the same but with a difference - he is a human computer with a secret. His brilliant performance rightfully deserves an Oscar nomination.I like how the story is framed and with added context from his childhood years. But as most biopics go, this one doesn't set the genre alight. The plot simply plays it too obvious and the central focus is held tightly only on the human calculator, so much so that all the rest of the characters feel peripheral. At times, because of the homosexual secret and the reverence for Turing, the story seems to play it too safe. For instance, I find Turing later years nearing his suicide feel too vague and everything feels so touch and go. I mean I don't need to see Turing having sex, but it would help to illustrate vividly the shameful period in English history when homosexuality is a terrible crime and how these 'criminals' are inhumanely treated by the government is worst than the homosexual act itself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Fascinating in many ways and surprisingly humorous,"The Imitation Game is a must-see. Perfect for those interested in history, technology, social conventions affecting groups (women, gay people, those with autism) and the struggles of visionaries way ahead of their time.I knew a bit about Turing from computer science studies, but was eager to learn more. While The Imitation Game does take some artistic license in dealing with the facts, it more than makes up for it by delivering an intense, thrilling and surprisingly funny drama with a tragic ending.The story covers the historical aspects of Turing's work and includes some glimpses of his earlier years in a beautiful, engrossing way, thanks to a stellar performance by Alex Lawther. Benedict Cumberbatch gives his best performance yet as the adult Turing, and the rest of the cast is excellent as well.

Not sure how to rate this - Turing probably could,"Going in - as an AI major, nonetheless - I was pleasantly surprised somebody actually dug up significant money to make a film about such a niche subject. Having actually seen it, I'm a bit torn.The good news: ""The Imitation Game"" is a well-meaning biopic about a great, complex man most people haven't heard about but absolutely should. It's highly recommended if you have a passing interest in either computers or WW II.The bad news: the film has been considerably dumbed down to make it suitable for mass consumption, leading to far-fetched dramatic setups, nonsensical science, forced dialog and a simplistic rendering of pretty much all of its characters. Knightley and Goode have little to work with, and Cumberbatch fails to fully tap into his inner nerd: Turing's social awkwardness is never real, and neither are his autistic mannerisms.

Possibly the best British movie of the year,"The Imitation Game has Benedict Cumberbatch playing Alan Turing. The film shows various different points of Turing's life: His difficult school life, his triumphs during the war and his conviction for his homosexuality after the war. The film drifts through these various timelines in a non linear way and paints a brilliant portrait of Turing. His conviction following the war could have been focused on more and Keira Knightly is a bit jarring, but TIG is unshaken by its flaws and emerges a triumphant and deeply moving historical drama. Like many Oscar baiting movies it's all about the acting. Benedict Cumberbatch is absolutely outstanding as Turing and as far as I'm concerned he's the best actor Oscar front runner for 2014. Everyone else is good as well, and Keira Knightly isn't totally unbearable. The acting is what makes the film and the film might be less memorable without Benedict, but the other elements of the film are well done too.Although the script uses a line to do with people others think nothing of doing something extraordinary a bit too often, otherwise it's a sensitive, moving and well written character study. All 3 of the parts from Turing's life are very well done. The part about his school life is very powerful and sad; the war part is suspenseful and fascinating while the final part revolving around his decline following the war is incredibly moving. The direction is very good as well and injects the film with real tension and power. TIG is in general told, directed and acted excellently and it's a very interesting and moving film. It's certainly not the feel good film of the year, but it is one of the best films of the year. It also doesn't feel like it's being made just to get awards and doesn't have that off putting Oscar baiting vibe to it. Even better than Nolan's Interstellar, TIG is an extraordinary movie and really deserves to be seen. And the best actor Oscar goes too....9/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Ignoring Important Facts Makes For A Better Film,"This is a film that garnered instant acclaim on its release . You can understand why because it is engineered as award bait . Perhaps conscious of this by the time the Oscars came about the film and the buzz about it seemed too have disappeared slightly even though on the big night it picked up one of the more prestigious awards for best adapted screenplay . I did have reservations before I watched THE IMITATION GAME . Alan Turing was of course a homosexual in an era when homosexuality was outlawed so I jumped to the conclusion we'd be watching some grief whoring PC bio-pic where the subtext gets all shouty and ranting that see how a nasty society treated a gay man who defeated Nazi Germany single handed . On top of that as ENIGMA showed from a few years back the premise doesn't lend itself to cinematic storytelling and despite being a work of fiction with a James Bond subplot shoehorned in that particular film ended up being very boring so I didn't have any great hopes for TIGWhat the film does superbly is painting Turing as an uber-geeky eccentric outsider . I've no idea what the real Alan Turing was like as a person but as the stereotypical view of a genius who knows the square root of everything while knowing nothing about social interaction Cumberbatch is vey good here . He was in the running as the eleventh DOCTOR WHO and watching him here you get the taste of what he'd be like as an alien genius in a performance that never seems forced in anyway . What the screenplay deserves great credit for is that any unpopularity wartime Britain had for Turing wasn't down to a homophobic society but entirely down to Turing lacking any social tools and the possibility that he might be a Soviet double agent when the Soviets still had a neutrality pact with Nazi Germany . Turing's homosexuality is addressed of course but this is a small part of the story . Best of all the film explains the impossible task of breaking Nazi codes that in theory would take 20,000 yearsWhere the film does fall down is in overstatement . Breaking the enigma codes was only a very small factor in the defeat of Nazi Germany and quite often the allied leadership had to ignore the information since they didn't want to the Nazis to realise their codes had been broken . That said the one campaign of the war that terrified Winston Churchill was the U-boat campaign so this is valid . What possibly isn't so valid is the overdone clash between the enigma team and Denniston . Again I've got to put my hand up and say I haven't researched the real life story but people on this page claim to have and this is entirely fictional . I tend to agree and much of this interaction doesn't ring true and seems to be included to have an obstacle in the way of the protagonist .There is of course the constant criticism of nearly British film you've seen in the last couple of decades and that is the look of the production seems more in keeping with high budget television than cinemaI found myself enjoying THE IMITATION GAME more than I expected . It has a strong cast on top of their game and the story which on paper doesn't seem all that interesting did hold my attention . That said one gets the feeling that much of this is done by playing hard and loose with facts to make a better film and John Ford was always saying ""Print the legend"". Treat it as entertainment rather than a fly on the wall documentary and you won't go wrong",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Exemplary film-making,"THE IMITATION GAME is an excellent piece of cinema that proves that there's still an audience for mature, thought-provoking drama. This is British cinema at its finest: superbly written and acted, which tells a series of historical events in an involving way that covers the broad spectrum of cinema.I love the background of spying and code-breaking so this film's subject matter was right up my street. Alan Turing is a portrayed as a tragic genius character, and Benedict Cumberbatch - although not one of my favourite actors - is perfect in the part. He delivers a character full of quirky mannerisms, whose sheer resistance to normality and likability makes him likable in himself.The two-hour running time flies past and every scene involved in the film adds to something. Norwegian director Morten Tyldum, who previously made the equally fantastic HEADHUNTERS, shows himself to be a powerful film-making force. The supporting cast are also great, in particular an irascible Charles Dance, MI6 head Mark Strong (thankfully not typecast as a baddie), and Matthew Goode (WATCHMEN) and Allen Leech (ROME) as Turing's companions. By turns moving, gripping, exciting, and heartbreaking, THE IMITATION GAME is a cinematic tour-de-force.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A bore,"A biopic of Alan Turing, the father of modern computers. He spent WWII inventing a machine to decode the infamous Nazi Enigma machine. He was a closeted homosexual and probably had Aspergers Syndrome, as he had a very difficult time communicating to the people around him. He's played by Benedict Cumberbatch, and it's the sort of performance that wins actors awards - not to demean him, because he's very good. Keira Knightley provides a needed sense of warmth to the film as a brilliant mathematician who helps him break the code. This film was decent, but, to be frank, I was a little bored throughout a lot of it. I don't like how the script is structured (it intersperses flashbacks to his childhood and to a post-war time near his death in the mid-50s). The filmmaking is very pedestrian.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
One big lie,Shameful how the actual story is distorted to attribute achievements of other people to Turing. Certainly he would not have wanted that. He had own achievements and a movie about those could be made. Why so much fake? Just sad.,1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Gripping and moving with brilliant acting,"It does not surprise me that this film has been so well received by audiences. With the intertwining story lines of how the British mathematicians are going to break Germany's Enigma code and the challenges Turing faces as a gay man in the 1940s, it strikes a good balance as a gripping thriller that's not an action film and a moving drama that's not a depressing tragedy. The characters were very well thought through, each with unique qualities giving you an idea of what they are like without needing to give much information. No doubt this was helped by the excellent acting from the entire cast. Although Benedict Cumberbatch does a very good job in delivering the complex personality of Alan Turing, for me the more noteworthy performance was Keira Knightley's in what is probably her best one yet. In other films, her performances lack depth at times and it can feel like you're watching the same person again but with this one it is not the case. You actually forget that it is her playing this intelligent and captivating character. The brilliant performances of Alex Lawther as the young Turing and Mark Strong are also worth mentioning considering their smaller yet significant parts.The film is let down a little by the flow of the story and rapid movements from scene to scene. This may have been a conscious choice to give a mechanic feel to a film about a mathematical mind but it does make the story a bit hard to follow at times. This is not of much significance though as the film delivers in all other areas, not the least of which is the ending. It is hard to get endings right and is often the point at which films disappoint. That's not the case with this one, it's spot on. Don't miss this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
This is a incredible movie,"I don't know exactly one word to describe him, I mean both the character and the actor. Aran Turing, the famous code breaker, I heard about him before, I know he did something big, but I don't know he has such a beautiful mind, and I can't believe he died because of such a ridicules reason. And the actor, Benedict Cumberbatch, he is incredible, he bring this man to us so perfectly, so real, I cried during the last few scenes. I come to watch this movie because of Benedict, I'm a big fun of him, and I had to say, I'm a little bit mix up in the beginning, Aran and Sherlock, they are both genius, they both love challenges, and also they are been played by the same actor. But after the whole movie, I realize they are different, and I know Benedict better. The Imitation Game deserve the prize it owned. Personally, I highly recommended to watch this amazing movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Brilliant,"If nothing else, this film perfectly illustrates what ignorant scum the pigs are (pigs = police). Or how stupid people (the majority) fear the intelligent.

Sensational,"I must be honest, I was in two minds about going to see this movie, as over the years, I have been to see many movies that are based on actual events, only to be left feeling let down and frustrated. I needn't have worried, as The Imitation Game delivers on all fronts. It's a movie that I could easily see again and again and spot something different each time.It's strange, but I knew nothing about the pioneering mathematician, logician and cryptanalyst Alan Turin, but was aware of the enigma code and the efforts to try and break it. Benedict Cumberbatch is a sensation as Turin, bringing a realism and believability that is often lacking in movies of this nature. I found myself feeling his every emotion as he battles his own demons, the many obstacles that present themselves and the people that want him to fail.I wasn't convinced by Keira Knightley in the role of Joan Clark, a woman with more on her mind than just helping Turin break the enigma code. I just couldn't embrace as her as usual in this role and I can't put my finger on why that is. I thought the computer was a joy to watch, churning away, searching for the elusive answers that could ultimately shorten the bloodiest war in history. The Imitation Game takes you away from the fighting, the bombs and chaos of the battlefield and tells a fascinating story of a small groups covert efforts to break the Nazis enigma code.Their chances of success are slim at best with the odds heavily stacked in the Nazis favour.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Game On!,"This film is highly recommended.This year we have witnessed the rebirth of the bio-pic, films that are based on real life people and their ""based-on-a-true"" story genre. Most have been very sincere and earnest undertakings, telling those life stories with varying results from the superb to the overwrought. The Imitation Game falls into the former category and is one of the best films of the year.In Morten Tyldum's film, we follow the life of British mathematician and genius Alan Turing, a major force who, along with a team of similarly-minded decoders from Bletchley Park, help to end WWII by decrypting the Germans' top-secret messages called the Enigma Code. This hero fall from grace is the crux of this history lesson and makes for some powerful drama. That Turing also suffers from Asperger's Syndrome, stressing odd behavioral tics, strange mannerisms, and distancing him from others, plus carrying with him an illegal love that dare not speak its name, this solemn character has more than his share of hardships to overcome. That he is played by the resourceful and talented Benedict Cumberbatch only makes the film all the more watchable.Cumberbatch gives an astonishing performance. The actor zeroes in on his character's eccentricities in his stammers and hesitated speech patterns. His down-turned look and sudden glances add to Turing's many foibles in the most subtle of ways. Keira Knightley plays Joan Clarke, a smart no-nonsense British working girl who befriends Alan makes him become more human. Knightley brings an authenticity and poignancy to her role. Their final heartbreaking scene together has so much more impact due to their natural chemistry together and the nuanced acting choices these gifted performers bring to these two mismatched loving friends. The entire ensemble deserve kudos for their fine support: Matthew Goode, Rory Kinnear, Allan Leech, Matthew Beard, Charles Dance (a perfect foe), and Mark Strong. Alex Lawther as a young Alan Turing and Jack Bannon as his friend, Christopher round out this glorious cast.Director Tyldum crafts a fine film and keeps the exposition to a minimum with effective use of war montages to visualize the era. He paces the film well and builds tension with the emotional and numerical parameters that are set within the limited technology that these crypt-analysts dealt with on a daily basis.The literate screenplay by Graham Moore tells its story without pandering to its audience. It expects moviegoers to pay attention to the quick-witted dialog and clever exchanges between all of its well drawn characters. The film structure bounces from Turing's childhood to his life after the war and the time-line becomes a tad disconcerting. Alan's private illicit life appears to be downplayed as to be non-existent, a decision that contradicts the film's tragic ending.The Imitation Game is a timeless and engrossing film that shows the dedication and sacrifice of one man's obsession to do the right thing when all the wrong things finally overwhelm and destroy his own life. Turing's final days will always remain an enigma to the world, that a man who gave so much of himself was given so little respect and love in return. At least this film is a well deserved testament to a great man. GRADE: A-",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Thinking Differently,"Greetings again from the darkness. This year's holiday movie season has presented us with three very different war-based films - each a potential Oscar contender, and each with its own life lesson. Norwegian director Morten Tyldum (the excellent Headhunters, 2011) brings Andrew Hodges' biographical book to the screen in the form of the remarkable and true story of Alan Turing, the man credited by many (including Winston Churchill) for helping win WWII.Alan Turing was a brilliant mathematician and cryptoanalyst. He was also homosexual. Celebrated for his work in helping Great Britain crack the German's ""Enigma"" messages, he was also persecuted (through chemical castration) for his homosexuality. His suicide at age 41 (1954) was the likely result of his ""treatment"" during an era when such ""unacceptable"" behavior overshadowed any and all mental genius.The film utilizes Turing's 1951 police interrogation by a sympathetic and curious detective (Rory Kinnear) as a framing device for the three significant time periods of his life. We see Turing as a bullied schoolboy (played by Alex Lawther) discovering the early signs of his own brilliance, as well as his first love. Most significantly, we witness Turing's work with the Hut 8 team at Bletchley Park as they worked on complex code-breaking; and finally we see the remnants of a broken man, bathed in solitude and work, who has no real place in society.Benedict Cumberbatch gives an astounding performance as Alan Turing. We cannot take our eyes off of him, despite his Asperger's-type social awkwardness. Cumberbatch manages to expertly capture each extreme emotion that befalls Turing, not the least of which is the frustration of the genius, when lesser minds are unable to follow his vision. Some of the best scenes are of Turing's confrontations with a Royal Navy Commander (perfectly played by Charles Dance), and of course, the critical moments with the other members of his code-breaking team (including Matthew Goode and Keira Knightley).There are so many aspects to Turing's story: his impact on ending the war, how society treats true genius, his isolated childhood and final years, the extreme lack of civil rights for homosexuals of the time, and how his work on ""Christopher"" led to the development of computers. The second half of the film certainly presents the moral quandary, and the performance of Cumberbatch as a tortured genius overpowers any clichés that might creep in. Alexandre Desplat's piano and strings score is a nice compliment without ever becoming overbearing, and the use of actual war newsreels adds just enough reminder of what the mission was for this group of geeks (today's terminology).",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A pale imitation,"This film is almost a carbon copy of A Beautiful Mind, told about a different person: a tortured genius, a love interest played by a notable actress, doubters in more senior positions and a summary of their life's work.This doesn't mean that The Imitation Game is a bad film (by all accounts, there are good elements), but it seems like a wasted opportunity to not properly explore the brilliance and tragedy of Alan Turing's life, particularly when given a leading man of Benedict Cumberbatch's calibre.The plot is formulaic - audiences know his name, most will know his crowning achievement, so the movie merely fills in the middle of Turing's story. This results in few instances of cinematic inspiration, and too often witty one-liners or snappy conversations à la Sherlock Holmes take the spotlight off the subject.It also leans on the crutch of occasional shots of war to retain disinterested viewers, a trope that requires A) competent CGI, and B) a reason to show this. Neither is present here, making these shots seem crammed in, as well as breaking any tension (try to create drama with planes that look animated in the 90s).Cumberbatch is, as per his standard, fairly note-perfect (although I do believe Turing's awkwardness was embellished somewhat), and some of the rest of the ensemble (Rory Kinnear and Charles Dance) do their best to follow suit. I found Keira Knightley to be a bit bland, a crime as much her fault as the script's.Visually it does look good, as these larger-budget period dramas tend to, but I was mostly impressed with the visualisation of Turing's machine than anything else, and little was to be seen of any cinematography outside the norm.All in all, I think the biggest failing of this film was its shying away from tackling Turing's life on a larger scale. The end of Turing is a tragic story, but something that deserves to be told on the big screen.The Imitation Game does a bad job of bringing this issue (and its severity) to light, instead devoting all of its time to the wartime story. This shows not only a failing from the production to honour him properly, but a lack of ambition from those who chose to tell his story.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
functional historical drama lands a couple of solid punches,"As the war starts, mathmatician professor Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) arrives at Bletchley Park under the militarist Commander Denniston (Charles Dance) to break the German Enigma code. He is joined by math student Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley) and chess genius Hugh Alexander (Matthew Goode). Stewart Menzies (Mark Strong) is from the secret MI6. The movie also takes place in 1927 with Alan as a student and Christopher Morcom as his only friend and love. In 1951, police detective Robert Nock (Rory Kinnear) investigates Alan for being a Soviet spy but discovers that he's only guilty of homosexuality.The first half of the movie is a rather traditional historical drama. Cumberbatch is impeccable. Knightley is too much of a starlet. Of course, Denniston is a military blowhard. Turing's homosexuality is limited. It all has the feel of a sanitized docudrama. Then the movie starts landing some solid punches. I love the Hugh Alexander character. Alan and Christopher's relationship is pretty compelling. There is nothing physical but they do use the word love. Menzies is another great character. Alan's confession to detective Nock is riveting and poignant. It's missing his suicide scene. This vehicle started out functional with a couple of squeaky wheels and then it makes a few great turns.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Great Story,"This is one movie I really enjoyed. Someone once said, the best stories are written by life. And this is one excellent movie based on a true story. I have not known much about Benedict Cumberbatch before this movie, neither was I a fan, but I am sure now. He performed the character of Alan Turing so beautifully, he was an excellent choice. I can't wait to see what is next for him. I loved the chemistry and the friendship between him and Keira Knightly. Keira Knightly as Joan was awesome, I love a good strong female character, and she give an great performance as Joan. I enjoyed the surroundings and the carefully chosen cinematography.

Satisfactory but way too overrated,"Alan Turing, a man who is a hero of WW2 and someone whose technological achievements are still felt today. The Imitation Game is a movie about that man and what specifically he did during the war in regards to the Enigma machine and how he and his team managed to override the system so that the allies could essentially know what the next attack was and when. I found the film interesting but my word is this overrated, the kind of movie that is typical run of the mill Oscar bait and a piece that although could be well acted, really doesn't deserve all the praise it gets. Now OK this movie is far from bad, far from being poor really but it's only an alright film and really nothing that jumped out as different or new. Sure the story of Turing is important I agree but it didn't have to be so much like a Hollywood made movie that is way too full of over the top drama.The story is set into three time pieces, Turing's time at school, Turing during the War, and Turing before and shortly after being arrested on claims of being a soviet spy. The story really tries to tug at the heart quite often I mean it has it's moments of excitement and fun but a lot of the time it doesn't know whether it wants to thrill you or make you cry. The times it does know what its doing are when Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing is on the screen and usually in a scene where he has to really fight for his views, not only does Cumberbatch act it out well but also those scenes are the most beautiful. Cast such as Keira Knightley are OK and I liked the addition of Mark Strong although he is definitely not seen enough.Director Morten Tyldum I felt was pretty average really, his vision is not properly set out from what I could see and with him at the helm the movie suffers from the over dramatics I mentioned. Graham Moore adapts the movie from the book ""Alan Turing: The Enigma"" by Andrew Hodges but although he won an Academy Award for his work in writing it, it is far from award winning stuff in my opinion. The script is full of things we have all seen before, we know roughly how it will end (well the WW2 part anyway) and the dealings with the disgusting attitudes toward homosexuality in the day are not actually explored enough to make us feel as bad as we could do for Turing (although Cumberbatch goes a long way to make us so).Now if you go into watching this movie only thinking that you will find it great then scratch that because I and from what I have seen many others also find this your same old kind of story. The plot is fun at times but too slow to begin, the acting is not all good and although cast like Cumberbatch maybe deserve nominations for awards, I disagree with some other things this movie was nominated or won throughout the world. That said the movie is enjoyable, my review maybe seems a bit on the negative side but in truth the movie is satisfactory, enough is made of the typical plot to make this acceptable and sort of likable biopic of Alan Turing.So overall I would recommend it but not to everyone, if you like your stories that play out like this then go and see it, you may really enjoy yourself but I can't see why this is considered so great or incredible. So yes Alan Turing a true unsung legend of World War II and someone who should be remembered by the generations that will come as someone who not only helped win the war, but also saved possibly millions of lives too.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
beautiful performance by Benedict Cumberbatch,"Benedict Cumberbatch is codebreaker Alan Turing in ""The Imitation Game,"" a 2014 film based on the true story of Alan Turing, a mathematical genius and the father of the modern computer.The first review on this site complained that the movie is historically inaccurate. Most biopics and films about famous events are historically inaccurate. Films say, ""Based on a true story,"" not ""an absolute factual true story."" Events are moved or telescoped, characters are combined, etc. because it's a movie, not a book that lists facts. The idea is to become interested in the subject and go home and read about it.Detractors of this film, some of whom haven't seen it, state over and over that the Poles broke the Enigma code. This has nothing to do with the movie. The Poles broke the code, but NO ONE HAD EVER BROKEN THE German NAVAL CODE. Turing built his machine -- which looked like the one in the film, by the way, to break that code. You'll notice that everything discussed had to do with vessels, convoys, ships, etc.""The Imitation Game"" is not about a machine. Also World War II, being one of our larger wars, was certainly not won by one man, but by the work of many, including the early work of the Poles, who are honored at Bletchley Park just as Alan Turing is honored.This is the story of literally a tortured genius, isolated, very much in his own head, antisocial, but a man who believed in his own abilities. He goes to work trying to break the German code; the codes are reset daily, which means if you can't break the code in a day, all your work is for nothing, and the next day, you start over. The idea was to get the code broken in a matter of minutes instead of hours using the machine.Turing is not easily accepted by his coworkers (Matthew Goode, Allen Leech, Matthew Beard) but gets along well with Joan (Keira Knightley), who urges him to be a little friendlier because ""you're going to need ""all the help you can get."" They have to fight to continue their work, since it's not happening fast enough for the government.It's been said Benedict Cumberbatch plays the role of a brilliant eccentric well, but this character is the complete opposite of Sherlock, though their minds might work similarly. It's a passionate, intense performance. He is perfect as the socially inept Turing, a true nerd, a bullied schoolboy who had but one friend growing up. His portrayal is heartbreaking.Let's hope we've improved as a people and, because of sexual proclivities are less likely to crucify someone who has made a tremendous contribution to the world. Genius takes many forms, and as Turing's friend Christopher says, ""Sometimes it is the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Review - The Imitation Game,"I think that this movie was a really good one, it was a really different war movie if you compare to other war movies. What makes it an even better movie is that it is based on a true story, the story of Alan Turing. He was a mathematician/scientist who studied the enigma code during the second world war. The actor who played Alan Turing was Benedict Cumberbatch, and I think that he played Alan Turing great, he really made the impression of watching Alan Turing. The combination of drama and war always works out in these kinds of movies. Almost all of the war movies, especially world war ll movies, have some kind of drama in them to make it more interesting to look at. The movie had a really good beginning and ending. Why this movie made it special to me was that the movie didn't have a lot of action (which I like) but the movie was more fitting and better without action even though it was a story about the World War ll. The ending of the movie was really special. And the same thing happened in the real life of Alan Turing. The movie had a lot of details and feelings, which made the movie really good. I would rate this movie a 7 out of 10 because of all the details and how good the acting and the plot was.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Outstanding,This has to be one of the best films of this or any other year. It features a performance from Benedict Cumberbatch that will surely win him an Oscar. He is supported by an outstanding cast and a story line that if it were not true would be hard to believe! As a tribute to Alan Turing this fine film fits the bill. The story will be familiar to most but still manages to have a few twists and turns along the way as Turing's personality clashes with those above and below him. Benedict Cumberbatch presents Turing as someone who is just too intelligent for normal society. His obsession with cracking the code leads to tension within his team and a lack of support from those above him. His sexuality is touched upon at the end of the film and his post-war years viewed from 2014 seem to be from another different world of social acceptability. A must see film!,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"The Imitation Game is a near perfect biopic on Alan Turing, an unsung World War II hero and the father of modern computers.","Not many people knew who Alan Turing was, other than the fact that he was the father of modern computing and related artificial intelligence. As a biopic centered on Turing's crucial years, The Imitation Game is a stirring film behind his genius and why he remained an unsung World War II hero until recently.Set between 1939 and 1945, but flanked by plot arcs set in the early 1920s and 1950s, Norwegian director Morten Tyldum gives us a glimpse into three phases in Turing's life, where each phase reveals a little more about who he was, what he did, and how he helped end World War II by as early as four years. The central aspect has Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) working with British Intelligence as a code breaker in London's Bletchley Park, the UK's Government Code and Cypher School. His job is to break and decipher what the Allies referred to as the unbreakable Enigma Code – Germany's highly encrypted radio transmissions that allowed the Nazi war machine superior naval and aerial assault on vulnerable Allied positions. Assigned to a small group of code breakers including one female, Joan Clarke (Kiera Knightley), Turing is initially an outcast due to his reclusive and eccentric nature. With time running out, Turing eventually finds favour in his MI6 supervising officer Stewart Menzies (Mark Strong) whose connections with Prime Minister Winston Churchill lands him enough resources to build a machine that has half a chance at breaking the Enigma code.That World War II ended in Allied victory is retrospective of the final push between the Allied forces and Hitler's Third Reich. While cinema history is studded with countless war and action films encompassing this era, The Imitation Game, on the other hand, is not a war film and not a single bullet is fired by any of the characters. It is still a period piece and one that had to be told for at least two important reasons. In adapting from mathematician Andre Hodges' 1983 book Alan Turing: The Enigma, Debut screenwriter Graham Moore saves these reasons for the final thirty minutes of the story, thus limiting the story to a mere countdown spy-thriller, albeit well told in the hands of the director. After saving as many as 14 million lives, why wasn't Alan Turing a decorated hero? What were the real reasons leading up to his eventual suicide in 1954? And why was his memory granted posthumous honour but only in 2013? The answers are there, some of them shocking, but a little too late in the film which itself is about a story that is told a little too late.Understandably, Turing's work within the supposedly non-existent MI6 was classified until recently. The fact that this film was made after the declassification of his contribution makes sense. That being said, the final reveal feels restrained and panders towards social commentary rather than taking the time to venerate a war hero. But if you overlook flaws in the story, including a hokey 'Eureka' scene when they finally break the code, The Imitation Game is still a good film with several tense moments; one of which is the juncture the team arrives at when they break the code. It's a startling moment in the film literally illustrating the power of knowledge as godly.Thematically similar to the Academy Award winning A Beautiful Mind, with as many glowing reviews and the possibility of a parallel Oscar run, I conquer that The Imitation Game is well made and very well acted for a period piece. Cumberbatch anchors his role with absolute virtuoso in portraying Turing as an unlikable and egotistical individual with superior intelligence, while ultimately exposing his vulnerability as a misunderstood introvert. Together with Knightley, they make formidable pairing depicting interpersonal relationships that are equally charming and tragic. It is indeed a tragic story considering what Turing could have achieved for humanity, only to be utterly disregarded by what is supposedly modern civilization.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"A remarkable movie - but not to be taken as a documentary, nor even as the only way to tell this story","This is one remarkable movie.Yes, the story of the breaking of the enigma machine codes is a fascinating one, though, as one reviewer points out, this movie really doesn't get into the details of how that was achieved - details that most of us, myself included, could probably not have understood. And the tale of Turing, the man who led the team that cracked Enigma and thereby helped to save millions of lives by bringing WW II to an earlier end but then was persecuted under England's anti-gay laws, is a truly sad one. Again, though, it appears that the movie fabricates some details to make the tale particularly moving. But neither of those two historical events makes this the remarkable movie that it most certainly is.Rather, it's the same stuff that has made for great movies from the beginning: 1) a brilliant script that never plays down to the audience, but always keeps us interested 2) first-rate directing that knows how to bring such a script to effective life 3) first-rate acting that makes us forget we are watching actors and makes us believe we are watching real people going through real situations.This movie held my interest from the beginning and never let it go. I feel safe in recommending it to anyone who enjoys a really good movie.I see that some of the reviews on here talk about the differences between Turing and the breaking of the Enigma codes as presented in this movie and the historical truth. That's interesting, certainly, because this movie very much makes us want to know more about both, but it has nothing to do with the quality of this feature film. If I may make an extreme comparison, the real Medieval prince of Denmark, son of King Hamlet, bore very little resemblance to Shakespeare's masterful creation, yet we don't fault the play *Hamlet* because of that. This movie, like Shakespeare's play, takes aspects of certain historical events and characters and creates a remarkable and deeply moving story from them. It never pretends to be a documentary, and therefore should not be faulted for not being historically accurate.At the recommendation of one of the other reviewers on here, I have since watched the BBC TV movie *Breaking the Code* (1996) about Turing. Again the script is very good, and the performance by the actor who portrays Turing, Derek Jacobi, first rate. The presentations of Turing are VERY different, however. Jacobi's Turing is far less anti-social, and the BBC movie centers far more on the persecution of Turing for his homosexuality in the 1950s than on the breaking of the codes during the war. The presentation of Turing is far more sympathetic. I confess that I found *The Imitation Game* to be more engaging, however.Since Milos Forman's *Amadeus* was on TV the other night, I was also reminded of how similar the framing device in *The Imitation Game* is to the one used in that masterpiece. Once again the body of the movie consists of developments of scenes mentioned by the main character to an interrogator (a police man, a confessing priest) through whose reactions to the unfolding story we are given a key as to how to perceive it ourselves. The police interrogator's face, at the end, when he says that he cannot pass judgment on what Turing has told him reminded me of the thoroughly devastated priest who is left speechless after hearing Salieri's presentation of his battle with God.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Never let truth spoil you a good story,"What is truly amazing for this film is that it is based on a real story. Really this Cambridge professor helped Britain win the war by cracking a code? He really saved millions of people? And nobody knew about it for 50 years, and he ended up killing himself after having been forced to chemical castration because of homosexuality? And we're talking of the founding father of Computer science? If I hadn't heard of Turing before, I would have a hard time believing this is a real story.So this movie is brilliant because the story of Alan Turing is unbelievable. There's something intriguing about secret services, all these Top Secret files that few people in the world know about. Because we don't know what they say, we can expand our imagination limitlessly when wondering what do they actually say. As far as we are concerned, they might entirely change the way we conceive history. And this fact, the idea that Turing died without ever being recognized on his contribution in WWII because it was Top Secret, it's what makes you sit on the edge of the chair when watching this movie.The problem is that, when you do a little research, you find out that the movie takes HUGE creative freedoms when it comes to truthfully depicting the story. It creates struggles where they never existed, completely alters the nature of Turing's work at Blechley Work, and makes Turing meet people who in the movie blackmail him but that he actually never met (to just name a few...). All of this to give more drama to the story. And they succeed on it.Then yes, of course, Benedict Cumberbatch pulls out an amazing performance. The role of a compulsive genius allows him to show all his potential. The portrayal of Turing as a complete asocial allows the script to have a couple of very funny dialogues, that actually make you laugh. And Keira Knightley is not bad, but I bet the real life woman was not as beautiful.What makes this movie not perfect? It's actually full of common places. The one cheesy tagline that is repeated two or three times across the movie. The sudden realization that owes itself to a completely unrelated comment but requires the hero to run back to his workplace. The cliché dramatic pauses before an important line. Tywin Lannister acting as Tywin Lannister, but with WWII uniform. Little things that, overall, don't spoil the movie that much. It's still very much worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The Underrated Story of Alan Turning,so going into this movie i wasn't really expecting much. I was expecting an Oscar buzz movie set in the world war era and thought i was going to find this movie boring. But to my surprise i was wrong because this is a great movie. The story is based around a man named Alan Turing and what his part was in the war. Alan is kind of a outcast and is sort of the odd one out and is played brilliantly by Benedict Cumberbatch. I really bought him as this character and he definitely brought something to this movie. In Fact all the acting in this movie was fantastic. There was not a single bad performance. The movie revolves around turning and his team trying to crack the enigma code however also touches on other subjects in turnings life which i will not spoil but i will say that is was a pleasant surprise that this was in the movie. However i felt that they could of spent a little more time with certain things in turnings life and the ending did feel a bit quick. Overall i thought that this film was great and i say that you should check it out. 8/10,7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Absolutely Wonderful *some minor spoilers*,"Having seen majority of films from last year (except for Birdman), I can safely say that The Imitation Game is the best film I have watched in past one year, it's that damn good. In fact it was so good that I did a bit of research, surely a film this good can't be historically accurate and I found out it isn't which is OK. This is how films need to be, use a bit of creative license and make your product interesting while not compromising the spirit of the film. Not every film can be like Raging Bull (my personal favorite) historically accurate and be an excellent film on top of it, but they can try to be like Amadeus wherein facts are changed but the end product is so much better than a boring accurate movie (how mediocre was last year's winner 12 years a slave? I almost slept through that) . Now that we got that out of the way The Imitation Game is the first on screen adaptation of Alan Turing the father of computer and it's about time this man got his due. Alan Turing and his comrades played a crucial role in decoding the Nazi code Enigma, there is of course so much more to the story but The Imitation Game plays out like an old school spy movie, each character has layers of secrets which are unraveled during the course of the film. The film isn't just satisfied with giving you the breaking of the code but it also provides for interesting themes, Turing hiding his homosexuality which could have severe consequences at that time, caring for Joan a brilliant woman whom he got engaged to despite his sexual orientation so he wouldn't lose her, a double agent among friends, childhood love and how that concept influenced Turing's machine, interesting moral angles and some truly deplorable decisions and even some A.I. talks, this film has so much going for it.The actors are great Cumberbatch gives a career best performance, ensemble cast is excellent as well. It's nice to see Matthew Goode get roles, a talented actor who never gets his due. This film has my vote when it comes to the Academy awards I hope this wins the best picture. I am going to watch this movie in the theaters for a second time which I haven't done since 2013's Her.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A worthy film for a remarkable man,"(70%) A handsomely made, decently paced, informative war-time intelligence drama headlined with one of the best performances of the year. Cumberbatch is truly brilliant here, and I am now officially a fully fledged fan of his, while Keira Knightley continues the throw away the shackles of the dreadful Pirates of the Caribbean sequels. There are numerous quite gripping scenes, more than a few touching parts, and by the end an annoyed biting feeling to the way in which Alan Turing's was treated after everything he had done for so many people. It may not be a 100% must watch, but as far as catch if you can movies go, this is one of the finest of the year.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Best of the current ""batch"" of big-screen bios","You have to wonder if the executives at the Biography Channel are getting nervous.The industry, known over decades for its ""binge themes"" or beating an idea to death, has brought out three blockbuster bios this year so far.As fate would have it, I saw this one last, and can offer these comments:* as I said in other reviews, all biographies by their nature tend to bend the rules of film. You are no longer making entertainment, you are also educating and you are paying tribute to a man or woman who deserves it (or else what is the purpose?). That's a lot of balls to juggle at once* of the three this was the most engrossing. Add to that fact that, of the three, this was only non-original story (I have seen other bios of Truring) so that leaves us with a paradox -- how can the least original be the most interesting?* the answer of course goes back to basics. Writing and acting. The writing is sharp, and it stays that way. The acting is to die for. Cumberbatch throws his Holmes mojo out the window and creates a Truring so memorable it will, I think, become the definitive one. And Keira Knightly (playing younger) has always had those big ""quizzacle"" eyes to work with, but, in my view, never had a script (about ciphers and puzzles) which gave her so much elbow room to make use of them.Good fun.((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

Benedict Cumberbatch Triumphs With An Exceptional Performance...,"Based on late British mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst and pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing, 'The Imitation Game' is an engaging biopic, that re-tells a true-story with conviction. But the best thing about the film, is Benedict Cumberbatch, who portrays Turing, without missing a beat.'The Imitation Game' Synopsis: During World War II, mathematician Alan Turing tries to crack the enigma code with help from fellow mathematicians.'The Imitation Game' engages you at most times, but a slowly paced first-hour, does get to you after a point. The sequences in the film's not-so-happening first-hour, hardly offer much power. Its the second-hour, however, when this biopic gathers momentum & blows you over with a heartbreaking, yet captivating culmination.Graham Moore's Screenplay, which is loosely Adapted by Andrew Hodges's Biography: Alan Turing: The Enigma, starts off on a slow note, but pushes itself to great heights later-on. Morten Tyldum's Direction is dignified. He has handled this important biopic, with style. Óscar Faura's Cinematography is sharp. William Goldenberg's Editing offers quality. Production Design is outstanding.Performance-Wise: Cumberbatch is pure genius, a fearless, versatile actor! He delivers an unforgettable turn as the late mathematical god. Right from the very beginning to the very last scene of the film, Cumberbatch leads 'The Imitation Game'. He deserves an Oscar-Nod for his wonderful work here. Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke, has been far more compelling before. She's fine, nonetheless. Matthew Goode as Hugh Alexander, is in very good form. Mark Strong as Maj. Gen. Stewart Menzies & Charles Dance as Cdr. Alastair Denniston, are stellar.On the whole, Above everything else, 'The Imitation Game' showcases the undeniable talent of Cumberbatch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

The Human Differences set aside,"Rather recently I have read a periodical in a technical text, albeit outdated, it pointed out an interesting point. We do all believe that nature is surely most efficient and flawless system to be ever created- what a common misconception- even function such as photosynthesis wastes more than it produces. Similar thing happens with natural selection- inequalities forming mutations during the DNA synthesis are the only thing that drives the evolution- if not a copy mistake we would've barely moved further than a small microbe. On the other hand, such mutations, are not widely acceptable by the nature- nature eliminates everything that is different- be it a frog without a leg, or leopard with white socks- and here comes the inefficiency. If nature wants to improve by making mistakes, why does it want to erase them short while later?The Imitation Game doesn't address this process, but on borderline, you can see it. That is if you pay attention, which we are strongly advised in the opening minutes, same as information that in the end, after hearing the story, we're to make a decision- is our unlikely hero Alan Turing a human or a machie, a mistake in the system or its key note?To arrive to the conclusion (with clever use of non-chronological time lapses), we are to burrow into mind of Alan Turing, most acclaimed mathematician of recent century (albeit awarded for his doing in 2013), a professor at Cambridge, and an unique personality. This story is a biopic, it depicts on his life and his doings, most notable being a huge part of Enigma cracking. Of course disarming of the German Device goes to many names and countries- Poland for starting it, being the pioneers and inventors of the first machine; the governments keeping it a secret; soviets having a go- but, this being movie about Turing, his actions make for a highlight.I, being an introverted person, struggling to form a simple sentence or participate in any social activity- could understand the frustration of Alan. I know I speak different, I know that sometimes it looks like I don't feel things, it's not my fault, you take it for granted as you can do it, while I struggle keeping end with end and your giggling is not helping. Not all people are going to accept you, it is natural selection, some will praise you and cheer at your successes, some will just wait till you trip- it's life, it's natural some people are more primitive than other.Turing is a person hard to like- arrogant, autistic genius- that would surely sneer at your idiocies and confusingly gape at any remark. With a squeaky accent and intervals in speech he makes for a poor companion, if not Joan, a revolutionary only-woman on the team, played by Kiera Knightley, the entire film would've surely end up being an one-man show. And I know, either way, that the lead actor (Ben. C.) would've managed to hold it up, his performance is strong (maybe not worthy a win, but surely a nomination) but it trips at times, the accent sometimes feels inconsistent, and his role differs just slightly from pieces that made his milestones. The strongest thing about Ben, is that he can play clever (god bless, in real life he's all but smart), it has to be clear and fast voice going well with the Victorian triangular face. Greatest talent of this freshly-emerged A-list actor is that he can take arrogant and unlikable into a passable, charismatic pals. We don't get offended when he insults the public, we laugh and respect him. That's a rare thing. (Although, I really don't want him to get an Oscar, Sherlock production is slow as it is). There's no member of cast that doesn't do a good job.The movie is accompanied by a great score, fine script and cinematography. It's two hour run might drag, although this is due to compact location of story rather than the plot (which has no dull point and is tense from start to finish). The lack of context on Enigma can anger some, and I've heard that there are some historical inconsistencies (but I don't know the first thing about history, so cannot comment).Other notes:-I did not read the biography or watched too much source material to comment on their accuracy. I cannot say how accurate thing is without reading at least 3 different accounts; how can you judge without having strong points of evidence?-Felt little like A Beautiful Mind-The copper coil wire was funny, especially when you know what happened recently-It takes place in Manchester, at Manchester University with alumni of Lead Actor. Manchester should be chuffed. It is not really.-Cumberbatch has low chances of beating other Oscar candidates- he's not only genius this year- but then again, I cannot say without watching-People laughed, frequently.-Some people cried, I personally felt sad too.Watchability 8/10 (I would eagerly put it back on) Overall 76/90* 85%*(originality to the source is not being counted)",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Cumberbatch is the crown jewel of this well-crafted biopic,"Biopics have become so commonplace today that they often lack the prestige they carried 10-20 years ago. So when one stands out, it deserves an extra bit of recognition and praise, and ""The Imitation Game"" is one such film, commanded by a fascinating performance from Benedict Cumberbatch.The ""Sherlock"" and ""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" star plays mathematician Alan Turing, the wrongfully disgraced father of the modern day computer and a war hero, the extent of which remained classified until the '90s. Turing was a total genius and a recluse, whom many theorize may have had some degree of Asperger's syndrome. However, his reputation was marred most for being a convicted homosexual, as private sexual acts between men were deemed criminal in England until the late '60s.Turing shares many traits with the character that shot Cumberbatch to fame, Sherlock Holmes, another savant-like character devoid of social manners who puts work ahead of relationships. The difference, however, is the BBC series employs those quirks for kicks, whereas ""The Imitation Game"" is a thoughtfully constructed portrait of a deeply misunderstood individual.Although the film opens with Turing's arrest in 1951, it uses this to frame the core of the story – Turing's work for British Intelligence during World War II, when he helped crack the German Enigma code and swing the balance of the war into the Allies' favor. It also flashes back to Turing's schoolboy days, which help to explain more of his behavior during his time at Bletchley trying to build a machine to decrypt the Enigma messages.The beautiful thing about Cumberbatch's performance is that it's multi-dimensional – we see Turing's social struggles, his genius, his unlikable qualities and his tenderness. His performance generates a powerful empathy and understanding of who Turing was and how he struggled through the world and his life. These characteristics live in balance, without any exaggeration. Neither his social ""quirks"" nor his sexuality define this portrayal, yet they are crucial to it.Cumberbatch might be the primary focus, but he doesn't tower over the supporting cast, which includes strong performances from Matthew Goode, Mark Strong, Charles Dance (""Game of Thrones"") and especially Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke, Turing's closest friend whose intelligence in ways dwarfed his own. Joan could've easily been reduced to very little, but Knightley gets good stuff to work with and as always, she brings strength and independence to her character.Still, the film's crowning achievement is Cumberbatch's performance, though much credit for his success in the role belongs to rookie screenwriter Graham Moore, who carefully selects the moments that best encompass Turing's multi-faceted identity and ultimately help us to understand him. And of course director Morten Tyldum deserves props for really giving Cumberbatch the time and space to thrive.""The Imitation Game"" is also rather impressively paced for a biopic. At two hours long, it rarely drags, nicely interweaving the 1951 arrest story line with the main code-breaking plot and the flashbacks. Perhaps this credit belongs to the fact that Tyldum (""Headhunters"") established himself as a director by making thrillers and editor William Goldenberg (""Argo,"" ""Zero Dark Thirty"") has made his career on similarly suspenseful films.The only place ""Imitation Game"" seems to trip up a bit is thematically. Its notions of humans vs. machines as it relates to Turing are a little bold and don't quite land the way Moore intends, but the portrayal of Turing has enough emotional resonance to carry the film from simply being very good and missing something to excellent.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Cumberbatch is at His Finest,"Let me start off with praising Benedict Cumberbatch. Cumberbatch has easily given his best performance and definitely in my top three favorite performances this year (along with Michael Keaton and J.K. Simmons). There were times where I didn't like him cause he was an asshole. Then the more we get into the film and see his character react well with his colleagues, I really start liking him more and more. Eventually, I just felt heart broken with what has happened to him (I won't spoil it but it is truly is disgusting). Keira Knightley also did a fantastic job. I usually enjoy her performances but I don't see her that often so it is refreshing.The story overall is well done also. Morten Tyldum did a good job on its direction and kept me fascinated through the entire movie. My only gripe is that in the movie there are time jumps. There will be flashback, present, and future scenes. Eventually the movie does sort of get jumbled up, confusing where we are in the story. The future scenes were maybe 10 years later after dealing with Enigma but Cumberbatch really looked the same age, if the makeup crew did something to make him look older that could have helped, but it was hard to notice.This movie is definitely a well-made film. Cumberbatch's performance is definitely one of my favorite performances this year. The cast and dialogue is well done to where it seems so real and I forget that it's all scripted. It's just shocking to know what people would do to those if they find those people were homosexual. It's just that the time skips got jumbled; confusing what time frame we're in. Despite that, The Imitation Game is definitely a movie that is one of my favorites this year. I do plan on seeing this again and will buy it on Blu Ray.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Exceptional life and great movie,"This movie is about the man (and the team) who found a way to break an unbreakable code machine ""Enigma"". If I can make a comparison, it would be: ""beautiful mind"". Both main characters were exceptionally intelligent and both have a mental condition that will not make you like them immediately. However, this summary won't do justice to the injustice of how homosexuals were (and in some countries still are) treated.Firstly the acting: Mr Cumberbatch gives his Academy Award card. The supporting actors do a great job next to this absolutely fantastic performance. Secondly, in the beginning the dialogs are due to the lack of ""social polish"", very funny. There was a lot of laughter in the cinema.The twist is something you have to see for yourself. Truth become a very interesting concept during this journey. I wonder how much it will take from a person that is not aiming to gain power to actually have the power over life and death. Of course nobody knows how WOII would have turned out but one can assume that these people changed the lives of millions. This man changed the lives of even more people due to his pursuit of a thinking machine ... I write on one of his great great grand-children-machines.Would I want to be Turing? Guess he didn't want to be him either but in the ""eyes of history his life was a privilege"". Please read don't read it as a statement but as a starting point for contemplation.It's a 9 rate now, as I only give a 10 when it keeps inspiring me in time. This is a potential 10, ranking next to Ghandi and Lawrence of Arabia. It depends how often I am going to re- see/listen to it one for inspiration ... not because it's positive message but because of it's complexity in human nature.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A Homosexual Mind,"A WWII influenced atmosphere. Protagonist, a young mathematical genius, sociopathic and emotionally restrained. Great promise and struggle with underachievement. A popular and charismatic rival who later becomes a friend. A woman who starts as a follower but later moves to the center of the protagonist's attention. A major revelation thanks to flirting with girls in a bar. A final breakthrough and the major success. Turn to the worse, the dark times and the dark secrets. Loneliness and impotence, with the only friend living inside your head. Acceptance of own fate. And finally a widespread recognition and a legacy that's hard to overestimate.It's funny how similar the stories can sometimes be. Is it because the filmmakers simply want to use the same instruments? Or because the people on whose lives those movies are based, brilliant but controversial, are bound by their fate to pass through such hardships to fulfil their destiny and find regard for their achievements? One can hardly tell. And maybe we shouldn't even dig deep into it, leaving it stay as a magic of the cinematographic art.As for 'The Imitation Game' itself, it is a very solid movie, gritty and dramatic, just as a life of Alan Turing itself, whose work made a huge influence on the course of the World War II, helping save millions of lives, but who ended up prosecuted in his own country for something that is now considered, if not a norm then, at least, a matter of one's private business. And while it may sometimes feel that the movies covering the WWII period are too aplenty already and that the filmmakers should move on and look for some fresher and more burning topics, films like 'The Imitation Game' allow us to see a whole epoch via the eyes of a single man, feel not only the world as it was but also what it was for real people to be a part of it, to live in it.But despite having an Oscar-winning screenplay, this film would not be what it is without the people who act it out. Benedict Cumberbatch may be hugely overrated and overpraised, but here he proved to have enough spirit, emotional charge and diversity to be really considered a great actor. Keira Knightley deserves the similar regard for portraying her character, but one has already come to expect that ability to make a teeth-clenching delivery of characters of any complexity from her. And although you can clearly see that she's not a young girl anymore, it seems that maturity only enriches her acting talents.Maybe 'The Imitation Game' is not an all-time masterpiece for which the last year would be remembered, but it's still pretty much worth watching. Even though it's about mathematicians, it's not school-boring, and after watching it you might even find more value in the everyday things that surround you, like having no government control over your intimate life or having digital gadgets that do not occupy a whole room or take forever to load a web page or play back a song.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Interesting and pretty good drama based on Alan Turing's life , magnificently played by Benedict Cumberbatch","In 1951, two cops called Nock (Rory Kinnear) and Staehl (Tom Goodman) , investigate mathematician Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) following an apparent break-in at his home. During an interrogation by Nock, Turing tells of his time working at Bletchley Park during the Second World War. In 1927, young Turing, unfortunately bullied at boarding school, develops a friendship with Christopher Morcom, who sparks his interest in cryptography. Turing develops romantic feelings for him, but later on , things go wrong . When Britain declares war on Germany in 1939, Turing travels to Bletchley Park. Under the direction of Commander Alastair Denniston (Charles Dance) , he joins the brilliant cryptography team formed by Hugh Alexander, John Cairncross Allen Leech , Peter Hilton (Matthew Beard) , Keith Furman (Goodman) and Charles Richards (Jack Tarlton), who attempt to decrypt the Enigma machine that the Nazis use to send coded messages. The true enigma was the man who cracked the code . Behind every code is an enigma .Unlock the secret, win the war .An enjoyable biopic based on the real life story of legendary cryptanalyst Alan Turing, the movie portrays the nail-biting race against time by Turing and his expert team of code-breakers at Britain's top-secret Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, during the darkest days of World War II. Main cast and support cast are frankly well . Main starring Benedict Cumberbatch is terrific along with Kiera Knightley . They are well accompanied by a very good support cast as Matthew Goode , Rory Kinnear , Allen Leech , Matthew Beard , Charles Dance and Mark Strong playing Stewart Menzies, who is the basis for Ian Fleming 's boss ""M"" in James Bond series . It contains a rousing and sensitive musical score by Alexandre Desplat . As well as colorful and evocative cinematography by Oscar Faura . The motion picture was well directed by Morten Tyldum .Adding more remarks to his biography , these are as follows: Alan Mathison Turing (1912 - 7 1954) was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist.Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. Despite these accomplishments, he was not fully recognised in his home country during his lifetime, due to his homosexuality, and because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act. During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. In fact , Winston Churchill stated that the Bletchley Park codebreakers made the single greatest contribution in Britain's war effort. For a time he led Hut 8, the section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic, and in so doing helped win the war.Due to the problems of counterfactual history, it's hard to estimate what effect Ultra intelligence had on the war, but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over 14 million lives.After the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine, which was one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948, Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s. However , Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts; the Labouchere Amendment of 1885 had mandated that ""gross indecency"" was a criminal offence in the UK , as he accepted chemical castration treatment to avoid prison punishment . Rating : 7.5/10 . Better than average . Well worth Watching",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Flawed genius, flawed movie","This is not the first movie to investigate the Bletchley Park team that cracked the Nazi Enigma code and hastened Germany's defeat. This version puts a lot more meat on the bones of the code-breakers' story and, more importantly, gives mathematician Alan Turing the full credit for his role as creator of the Ultra machine that finally broke the code. We now know that Turing is part parent, part midwife, to today's PCs and iPads and Smartphones.We also know that Turing was a homosexual in an era when gays were prosecuted and cruelly punished, although the writer and director of THE IMITATION GAME seem to be unsure about how far to go in exploring this side of Turing's fatally (as it would prove) flawed genius. Flashbacks to his boarding school days show geeky Alan clumsily and inarticulately in love with a fellow pupil, but his great love in the Bletchley Park period is Joan (Keira Knightley), the only female on the team. Benedict Cumberbatch perfectly catches the adult Alan's equally clumsy courtship of Joan, whom he loves but does not desire.The moral dilemma the Bletchley Park team - and the government - faced once they had broken the German code is chillingly presented but the movie's fatal flaw, for me, was in declaring Turing's homosexuality (and its terrible consequences) but not exploring it in any depth. We see the postwar police doggedly building a case against him, but we get few clues as to the kind of gay man he was. Perhaps Benedict was OK about playing gay but didn't want to fully ""do"" gay?What the Turing movie needed, I think, were a couple of the scenes like Gary Oldman had in PRICK UP YOUR EARS, candidly but not not too explicitly showing Joe Orton's naughty weakness for cottaging and rent boys. THE IMITATION GAME is a visual feast with well-judged performances from the entire cast, but it settles for being a Merchant Ivory-style period piece with (as the poster proclaims) more than one enigma at its centre. This is not the definitive biography of Alan Turing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

"This is why we speak English, not German",Alan Turing is the unsung hero of WWII. His genius and determination saved an estimated over 2 million lives and ended the war at least two years early. Amazing movie with a very tragic end on how this man was treated.,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The Lonely Genius,"A cursory read of Alan Turing's biography proves that the basic points of this film are factual. That some details have been tinkered with for cinematic appeal is possible. Turing was historically significant because he built a computer that broke the Nazi code, which helped win WWII. The script blends these events with Turing's personal life.Despite his genius brain, Turing nevertheless suffered as a gay man in a homophobic era, which brought loneliness and run-ins with the cops. With acquaintances he could be socially awkward, eccentric, arrogant, and humorously quirky.The script's non-linear structure makes for difficult viewing at times. Constant flashbacks to, and returns from, three different eras in Turing's life render unnecessary confusion. The first half is a bit boring, but drama picks up in the second half. The script conveys a realistic view of Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley). Most of the supporting characters come across as a bit nebulous.Appropriate for the historical era, the film uses 35mm format wherein grain structure is obvious. In Turing's later years, desaturated colors dominate, to convey a gray, sad tone; brighter colors and more contrast highlight his younger years. B&W archival clips show actual WWII scenes. Editing and production design compliment the cinematography. The nondescript piano score is okay but too loud in some scenes. Overall casting and acting are acceptable; Cumberbatch gives a credible performance.Significant historical content and release dates suggest that the producers intended for ""The Imitation Game"" to be Oscar bait. The film is a recent addition to a list of culturally relevant films meant to confer on Hollywood a sense of legitimacy. Fine film aside, Hollywood's motives here reek of self-congratulatory prestige.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
This is a movie not a documentary,"First of all I want to say I really liked this movie ,Benedict cumberbatches acting in this is amazing .

Somethings not right,"This is NOT a well made film. Number one - the dialogue is stilted. Number two the actors are wooden. The glowing reviews must have been posted by relatives and close friends of the actors because there is no way this rates 8.1. Add to that, the editing is sloppy, with quick breaks to flashbacks and even quicker breaks returning to the central story. All this with a lack of continuity of the four segments, present 1951, childhood at school, prewar, wartime, then no resolution to any of these parts. Then as to the ending - was there a reason for the assumed reconciliation? Benedict must be replaying Sherlock in this role, using the same facial expressions and quizzical looks. I watched intently to the bitter end and wondered why had I done so?",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Too inaccurate!,"At first I gave it an 8, then I moved it down to 4 when I found out how historically inaccurate it is.I know many people differ from me, but I am opposed to taking ""artistic license"" when they're simultaneously presenting the movie as based on a true story. Alan Turing's life is interesting enough not to have to resort to making things up.The following are, in my opinion, some of the more egregious inaccuracies (taken from Wikipedia):Naming the Enigma-breaking machine ""Christopher"" after Turing's childhood friend and suggesting that Turing was the only cryptographer working on it with others not helping or opposed. In actuality, this electromechanical machine was called 'Victory' and it was a collaborative, not individual, effort. It was a British Bombe machine, which was partly inspired by a design by the Polish cryptanalyst Marian Rejewski. Rejewski designed a machine in 1938 called bomba kryptologiczna which exploited a weakness in German operating procedures that was corrected in 1940. A new machine with a different strategy was designed by Turing (with a key contribution from mathematician Gordon Welchman, unmentioned in the film) in 1940. More than 200 British Bombes were built under the supervision of Harold Keen of the British Tabulating Machine Company.Showing a scene where the Hut 8 team decides not to use broken codes to stop a German raid on a convoy that the brother of one of the code breakers (Peter Hilton) is serving on, in order to hide the fact they have broken the code. In reality, Hilton had no such brother, and decisions about when and whether to use data from Ultra intelligence were made at much higher administrative levels.The depiction of the recruitment of Joan Clarke as a result of an examination after solving a crossword puzzle in a newspaper. In reality Joan Clarke was recruited by her former academic supervisor, Gordon Welchman, to the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS)Exaggerating Turing's social difficulties to the point of depicting him having Asperger syndrome or otherwise being on the autism spectrum. While a few writers and researchers have tried to assign such a retrospective diagnosis to Turing,[106] and it is true that he had his share of eccentricities, the Asperger's-like traits portrayed in the film – an intellectual snob with no friends, no sense of how to work cooperatively with others, and no understanding of humour – bear little relationship to the actual adult Turing, who had friends, was viewed as having a sense of humour, and had good working relationships with his colleagues.Scenes about Turing's childhood friend, including the manner in which Turing learned of Morcom's illness and death.Suggesting that the chemical castration that Turing was forced to undergo made him unable to think clearly or do any work. Despite physical weakness and changes in Turing's body including gynecomastia, at that time he was doing innovative work on mathematical biology, inspired by the very changes his body was undergoing due to chemical castration.Stating outright that Turing committed suicide after a year of hormone treatment. In reality, the nature of Turing's death is a matter of considerable debate. The chemical castration period ended fourteen months before his death. The official inquest into his death ruled that he had committed suicide by consuming a cyanide-laced apple. Turing biographer Andrew Hodges believes the death was indeed a suicide, re-enacting the poisoned apple from Snow White, Turing's favourite fairy tale, with some deliberate ambiguity included to permit Turing's mother to interpret it as an accident. However Jack Copeland, an editor of volumes of Turing's work and Director of the Turing Archive for the History of Computing, has suggested that Turing's death may have been accidental, caused by the cyanide fumes produced by an experiment in his spare room, and that the coroner's investigation was poorly conducted.Showing Turing interacting with Stewart Menzies, head of the British Secret Intelligence Service. There are no records showing they interacted at all during Turing's time at Bletchley Park.Including an espionage subplot involving Turing working with John Cairncross. Turing and Cairncross worked in different areas of Bletchley Park and there is no evidence they ever met.[88][89] Historian Von Tunzelmann was angered by this subplot (which suggests that Turing was for a while blackmailed into not revealing Cairncross as a spy lest his homosexuality be revealed), writing that ""Creative licence is one thing, but slandering a great man's reputation – while buying into the nasty 1950s prejudice that gay men automatically constituted a security risk – is quite another.""",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Best score 2014/2015.,"A masterpiece that fits the life of a true hero that Alan Turing was. Remarkable performance by Benedict Cumberbatch which should have been crowned with an Oscar, in my opinion. But for me the best thing about the movie is the the score by Alexandre Desplat. Moving, beautiful and just perfectly sending shivers down your spine in every moment of the film, without being intrusive. Never bought an OST before but after i saw The Imitation Game, i did. Just watch this moving Drama/Biography and sink into it, with the great tunes of Alexandre Desplat. The only thing why i gave 9/10 points and not 10/10 is Keira Knightly. She played the role good, but in my opinion not good enough or let's say not as memorable as Benedict Cumberbatch did. So a bit overrated for me. But all in all a must-see in every aspect.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Benedict Cumberbatch gives possibly the performance of his career,"The Imitation Game is a historical thriller starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley, based on the life of code-breaker Alan Turing. I found it very suspenseful and the subject matter was fascinating too. Benedict Cumberbatch gives possibly the performance of his career.Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a brilliant but socially awkward mathematician recruited by British Top Secret Intelligence to help crack Enigma, an extremely cryptic code created by the Nazi military during World War II. Enigma is considered impossible to decipher but Alan, along with his team of code-breakers, believe it can be solved, not necessarily by a lone human, but with a machine.Benedict Cumberbatch was fantastic in this movie. He really channels the way he plays Sherlock Holmes from Sherlock into his portrayal of Alan Turing. Keira Knightly was great as well as one of Turing's code-breakers Joan Clarke.I rate it 8.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
One of the Best of 2014,"This and The Grand Budapest Hotel, I believe, were two of the best movies of 2014. Ironically both films were scored by the same composer. Kudos to him.The acting and screen writing to this movie was impeccable. Great, great, great is all I can say about those aspects of the film.All the actors were superb especially Benedict Cumberbatch who I believe should have won the Academy Award for his performance. I am looking forward to the next season of Sherlock.I also enjoyed the acting and roles played by Mark Strong and Charles Dance. I first came across Dance in The Jewel in the Crown and thought he would go far but alas such was not the case.. As to Mark Strong, what can you say? He is one of the best actors around.The only let down related to Keira Knightley - her over the top accent and that ugly, repulsive hair colour. Why on earth did they give her that shade of hair colour for the movie? It was distracting to me.This movie is great. By all means see it. You will not be let down.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
NOT a documentary,"I saw this film hoping for a full account of how the team at Bletchley Park broke Enigma. What I got instead was a bravura performance by Dominic Cumberbatch of Alan Turing as a man of unique mathematical skills but completely inept at almost everything else. Presumably he was on the Asperger's spectrum, although that condition was not identified until long after Turing's death. Of course, his life had to telescoped to fit into the format of single film leading to a number factual inaccuracies many of which are listed in the Message Board below, but beware of spoilers.In addition to these, I suspect the depiction of the Commanding Officer should be viewed as a depiction of the type of forces officer who was completely unable to come to terms with the behaviuor of the academics who made the whole thing work.To my surprise, Turning's relationship with Joan Clarke (Kiera Knightly) appears to be accurate and not an attempt to bring in a love interest. Clarke's sex limited her role in breaking Enigma. Remember, 1940 was a time when the RAF was desperate for experienced pilots, but women who'd been flying for years were not allowed a combat role and we and were limited to ferrying new, unarmed, planes from the factories to airfields role.One other thing that disappointed me was the failure to differentiate between the Bomb (that was partly mechanical and had lots of wheels) and Colossus, built by a Post Office engineer to Turing's design that used valves, was entirely electrical, programmable, and the ancestor of modern computers.But, as I indicated at the start, this is not a documentary, it is a superb depiction of a genius.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Turing deserves much better!,"This movie is supposedly based on a true story, it says so right upfront. So that's a give-away straight off. It's mostly fiction.Set in the wartime Bletchley Park of screenwriter Graham Moore's imagination it's also supposed to be based on the factual account ""Alan Turing: The Enigma"" by Andrew Hodges (you'll see that claim in tiny print right at the end of the closing credits) which relates Turing's life and involvement with the breaking of Enigma. Anyone who has read that book will know that this movie bears little resemblance to that specific book (nor indeed to any other book on the subject), and I would even doubt that anyone involved with this production has actually read it, and that includes Graham Moore.Although names remain as in real life, also bearing little resemblance to reality are the characterisations of most others who were involved in the real events. Some of the main personnel who should have been included are missing, and events have been added that never happened, nor ever could have happened. The scene of the alleged breakthrough in the reading of Enigma traffic is totally absurd, as was the inclusion in the movie of the character of John Cairncross. Yes the latter was at Bletchley, but at a different time and in a different area, and would have been totally divorced from the events covered in this movie.It would seem that at the moment Cumberbatch can do no wrong, and his portrayal of Turing was precisely how the producers wanted him to play it, but it was most definitely nothing like the real Alan Turing whatsoever. And couldn't the producers have picked someone who actually looked like Turing? Likewise a look-alike to play Joan Clarke?As a fictional movie in its own right it was reasonable, but if anyone believes that it's an account of the true events then they'd be advised to do further research on the subject. There's hardly a line in the screenplay which would stand up to scrutiny. It's as false as the movie U-571, and equally as misleading on what really happened.I believe that Turing is one of Moore's heroes. I can only conclude by saying that (imo) he has given him a very unworthy epitaph. Given the service Turing gave to his country, the world, and to science in general, he deserves a much better epitaph than this pot-boiler of a movie.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"""The Imitation Game"" fully utilizes the medium of film to nearly perfect effect.","""The Imitation Game"" is an OriginalThe only complaint I have about ""The Imitation Game"" is the title of the movie. It's off-putting and doesn't give prospective viewers any idea what the film is about. ""The Imitation Game"" was the name of a mind-game the protagonist, math genius Alan Turing, played to learn about people. But the movie isn't about that game. It's about breaking the Nazi Germany Enigma code and the struggles Turing and his team go through to solve the code. Better names for the movie would be:""Breaking the Nazi Code"" (or just ""Breaking the Code"" which would have a double meaning for the film) ""Decoding the Nazi War Machine"" ""Beating Nazis at its Code Game"" ""Nerds Take Down the Nazis"" ""Take that Enigma!"" ""No more Heil to Hitler""Okay, some of those were serious, others not. The truth is, this is an excellent film, what great films can be, and I am worried the title will keep away viewers.It is a historical costume drama, and the English are often very good at that. The acting is superb, especially Cumberbatch. There are few false notes. That is to the acting and also an excellent script. The writers were able to propel the drama with the dialogue and put in some humour that allows us to learn about the characters along the way. No scene was added just to be dramatic; they all had duel purposes whether telling us about the relationships of the characters or demonstrating their struggles while continuing to lay out the plot.Of course the sets, edits and lighting were excellent; they had the budget to pull it off. The musical score is good and seldom noticed; the director didn't need to employ over-wrought music to force us have emotions. The drama spoke for itself.""The Imitation Game"" was able to do what ""The Theory of Everything"" struggled with. First, there are three different time periods in ""The Imitation Game"" and the edits and transition back and forth between those periods are nearly flawlessly. ""Theory"" struggles with that. Also, ""Imitation"" showed us different aspects of Turing's life, personal, scientific, work, as parts of a whole without leaving us with nagging, unanswered questions. ""Theory"" was not nearly as good at that. Both films have stellar acting and plenty of nerd appeal, but if you can see only one, see ""Imitation."" It is a much more human film where the emotion didn't play as false. Both are worth watching.Rating: Pay full price, see it twice.This may be the first time I have given a non-documentary full ratings. One of best aspects of the film is that war is not glorified while the need to defeat Hitler was made imperative. The film doesn't shy away from the British government's bigotry (and that of many people), hypocrisy and the tough choices the people who broke the Enigma code had to face. The film doesn't wallow in the tragedy like an after-school special, but it shows the warts and ugliness Turing had to face in mid-century England while breaking the ""impossible"" puzzle of Enigma.Peace, Tex Shelters",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Brilliant Benedict Cumberbatch,"To me this movies is one of the sure Oscar nominees for this year.I will try to be short so that I don't give any spoilers. The Imitation Game is a truly heartbreaking and mindblowing movie.First I want to bow to Benedict Cumberbatch who introduces us the character of Alan Turing in a brilliant way. His performance is intense, powerful, sad, funny, heartbreaking... actually I can use so many words to describe it and none of them would be enough.The plot is centered around the World War Two, where a group of young scientists try to break the German machine ""Enigma"". When you look at it this way it seems like another military movie (and there are a lot of them in the past years). But The Imitation Game is so much more. The movie shows us the immensity of human mind and the stupidity that comes when people refuse to recognize it.Morten Tyldum makes an outstanding movie filled with humor, wittiness, compassion, sadness and admiration to the human mind.I rate it with 10 stars and recommend it to all of you who want to see and intelligent movie with clever dialogues and deep, meaningful plot.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

"Great movie, worth a watch","""The Imitation Game"" is based on the true story of a mathematician and genius, Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch). This story catches your attention from the very start, in intriguing circumstances we meet Turing. We are led to the past to the start of the war, Turing is brought before Commander Dennison (Charles Dance) for an interview for a secret group of intelligence. Intelligence being the most important thing, they are to solve Enigma; the Germans unique encryption device with 159 million million possibilities of settings that changes daily. Throughout this superb thriller we see the struggle against the clock, one day to crack it before it resets all while people die at the hands of the enemy. This movie is gripping and will have your attention from the off.There is a reason why Benedict Cumberbatch is constantly on demand and is one of the best actors in Britain and perhaps the business. He is brilliant, he captures Turing so magnificently. Turing intelligence and social dispositions as well as his calculating and cold character. Benedict is very good, but one actor alone does not make a good movie, his role is well supported by Keira Knightly, Matthew Goode, Mark Strong and Allen Leech (Downton Abbey), who all put in great performances to compliment and emphasise the main messages in this movie.For me this movie heavily shows people breaking the moulds to which they are supposedly bound and we see a true insight into the social workings of mid 20th century Britain, and in particular Alan Turing who was in fact a homosexual. This movie leads to an emotional end but with lessons for us all.

This is one 'Game' you cannot miss.,"The Imitation game is based on the life of an unsung war hero of the World War II. And therein lies the brilliance in its story. It tells the story of a man who had to face great odds right from childhood, and go on to script history, and then eventually face even tougher hardships, never having been truly applauded for the tremendous impact he has had on the world as we know it.So, with a story itself so exciting and humbling, the direction and acting are meticulous. Benedict Cumberbatch grows on you as a character as the movie wears on. He perfectly captures the emotion and behaviour of Alan Turing. The movie is well-paced and has its moments of humour. Keira Knightley too was effective in her role, as were the rest of the cast.The movie also effectively portrays another facet of the war- that of the mental and physical trials of the men and women who were the brains behind the counter- intelligence forces of Britain. The background score adds to the atmosphere of the movie. Ultimately, the movie succeeds in Cumberbatch's acting prowess and the sheer brilliance of the man he portrays. Had the story been fictional, the movie would not have been as impacting. The very fact that this an integral yet little known fact of world history, elevates the movie to another level. There are several other themes apart from war that are well explored and contemplated in this movie, which is a necessary inspection in this time and age.Do watch it for that singularly exceptional man called Alan Turing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

"Take It as a Tale of an Amazing Man, Even Though it May Have Some Suspect History","This is the story of Allen Turing, who really existed. He is the mathematical genius who was engaged to try to break the German code ""Enigma"" during World War II. He is autistic and humorless, totally insensitive, with no regard for social interaction. He is driven by the task at hand and feels other things are superfluous. He is also under the gun from a commandeer who he insulted and who would love to be rid of him. Had his colleagues not reluctantly come to his aid when he was under attack, he would never have been able to do the work he did. He has one other problem. He is homosexual and at this time this is illegal and would get him drummed out of service and probably imprisoned. There are flashbacks of his youth, made horrible by his peers. It shows his relationship with Christopher, a boy whom he loves, the one person who gives him his due and his respect. Something terrible occurs after a school vacation, and Alan is left alone. The acting is quite incredible. Benedict Cumberbatch is turning into a major actor (to the chagrin of the ""Sherlock"" fans). Keira Knightly does a nice job as the female foil, who even agrees to marriage with Alan (although it is utterly doomed by his own admission). One of the stars is an amazing computer that Alan puts his life and heart into, designed to break the aforementioned code. It spins and clicks. For many, this was the first real modern computer (for all you abacus fans, I don't mean to be disrespectful). This is the story of another genius (keep in mind the current film about Stephen Hawking) who experiences heartbreak at every turn, whose peers hate but tolerate him. It's the story of a society that devalues a man because of the way he was born, that dismisses his accomplishments. There are two really emotional scenes. One is when he throws himself in front of his computer (which is named after his friend Christopher) as the military Philistines start to destroy it. And a scene with the headmaster of his school when Alan must say he barely knew the boy whom he loved. See this. One of the best films of 2014.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

And Enigma is the most difficult problem in the world.""The Imitation Game is about a true life story of the English cryptanalyst, mathematician and logician Alan Turing. During WWII the Turing led a group of code breakers at a top secret facility in Bletchley Park during the darkest days of the war in order to crack the German's Enigma code.Well it's settled, British films have completely change for the usual stick in the mood, low budget film. Oscar season after Oscar season, British films always make the nominations for Best Picture or Best Actor. Of course this movie got the big nominations and I so glad this got a lot of nominations from the Oscars, because this movie was pretty incredible.Now we have seen Cumberbatch in pretty much everything now: Sc-Fi, TV shows, animated films, drama, comedy, action and good god this guy is everywhere. Benedict Cumberbatch in this movie almost brought me into tears with his excellent performance as Alan Turning. Benedict is always good at playing these smart-ass genius that's always higher than anyone else, well in this it's a lot different. Yeah he starts off a bit unlikable how he shows off that he's the smart guy in the room, but after a while it changes and I actually felt sorry for this guy when you get to know his past and his secret that he tries to hind for all of his life. Benedict Cumberbatch played this guy so beautifully well that I think this is by far his best performances in his career.Keira Knightley has well dose a brilliant job playing her character in this film. Now I'm going to get some hate for this but I never liked Keira Knightley has a actress. She never locked on to me and she never won me over. I don't think She's a awful actress or anything like that I just never got into her as a actress, but in this film she dose do good as a supporting character that's really important to the story. Good work Knightley.The film is directed spot on and this is the first Morten Tyldum film that I've watched from him, yeah he did some other films in the past but I never going to watch them (Just being honest) He got the drama right, he got the relationship between Benedict and Knightley right and I think this director is going to go off and do some (I'm predicting here) some fantastic work of movies in the future.The writing has well is the soul of this movie. The director is the heart of the film, the actors are the veins of this movie. The writing to me perfectly got the main character pain and deep inside torture of he his secret of being gay and you know back then he would be sent to prison for that, so you really feel the hard work on not just solving the Enigma code but to hind who he truly is.For issues I haven't really got much to be honest. But is this a film that I will watch again and again, no not really. You may watch this loads of times more than me but to me this isn't a re-watchable film to me.But Overall The Imitation Game is brilliantly well done film with fantastic performances and a good story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Moving & Fascinating True Story -- Underwhelming Film,"To preface this review, I should mention that prestige biopics, Oscar season dramas and other true-story films of this ilk are not exactly the kind of film I hold in highest regard. Not to sound too snobby, but I'd rather watch a David Lynch or Coen brothers movie over a period piece any day of the week. That being said, when a film like The Imitation Game actually does impress me, that means it must be doing something right. I think this film is very much worth seeing — and that there's a lot to admire here — even if it's not the most artistic or unique movie of the year.Benedict Cumberbatch is the standout element here. His performance, which is backed up strongly by costar's Keira Knightley, transcends the somewhat generic filmmaking and bland direction, and helps to give it more genuinely likable and interesting qualities overall. Cumberbatch gives this material his all, and his performance is nuanced and believable; he's even able to deliver some of the clunkier dialog gracefully.The Imitation Game is lucky in that it's a legitimately fascinating true story. It's a war story about a less glorified, less talked about aspect of warfare, and the portrayal of Alan Turing and the role he played in winning World War II makes for a compelling account. Yes, the movie does feel slightly Oscar-baity at times, and it goes through many of the motions that a film of its genre is expected to go through, but the history is rich and important enough that it does elevate the less impressive aspects of the piece.While it may owe the majority of its quality to Cumberbatch and the source true story, The Imitation Game is a well made and respectfully told tribute to Alan Turing, and an interesting, at times stirring, biopic that is worth the price of admission. The ending in particular is very emotional and hard-hitting, and because of the fact that Turing never received proper recognition, it's important to know this story — even if the film itself is little more than a vehicle for just that. It's worth a trip to the cinema this Oscar season.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Kind Of Insulting To The Hero...And The Viewer,"Benedict Cumberbatch is pretty good throughout but it seems he gets the best lines of Graham Moore's oh-so-witty screenplay early on; after that it's simply a run-of-the-mill Weinstein Brothers presentation, burnished with the usual prettiness that makes it nothing more than Oscar chum. (In fact, it's a perfect example on how the politics of Oscar campaigns trivialize the whole thing.) The film concerns itself with the tortured life of Alan Turing, whose machine eventually cracked the ""unbreakable"" Nazi Enigma code. Moore writes him as a compilation of idiosyncrasies and throws everything together into a blur that appears to be Asperger's Syndrome mixed with childhood trauma and homosexuality--it all seems so easy to diagnose that very little of it ultimately rings true, and when Moore tries to develop Turing's emotional growth midway through, you know the jig is up as to what the film expects you to feel. It's kind of an insult to Turing to simplify him so easily and to the viewer for not being respected enough to deal with complexity. There's a fair amount of suspense generated (what will be the ""aha"" moment that allows Turing and his group of math whizzes to crack the code?) but a dull Soviet spy subplot clutters the overall feel of the second half. With Keira Knightly, who specializes in period pieces in which she generates zero interest. The director is Morten Tyldum, also showing very little in the way of differentiation. Recommended only for Cumberbatch's performance, which keeps you engaged through his puppy-dog expressions; if the script gave him more opportunities to be as much fun as he is the beginning, the film would have been far more successful.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Horribly inaccurate.  Do not use as factual information,"There is a strong urge for me to create this spoiler-free review. Let me preface this. I'm a theoretical computer scientist, so somebody who does work in a very related area that was founded by Turing's work (use it almost daily). For a film that boasts that it is ""based on a true story"", it is a travesty to portray such a well- documented persons' life and the events related to this movie so inaccurately. The liberties taken by the film are so dishonest that nobody should use this as a factual story. Turing wasn't so simple to lay out, his papers are a testament to this.If you want to get to know the actual story, get the actual biography the film is based off of, or even better (like I do), read his actual papers. I own most of them myself in collections from the 40's-50's.Go into this film to enjoy the acting, DO NOT use this as a real- true story tale. It has been demonstrated to be very inaccurate from the history of the Enigma to overshadowing Turing's most important contributions with emotional pleas that Turing held more as self-convictions than anything. He was a brilliant scientist, but this film just was so annoying as the inaccuracies got in the way.To make this blunt: This is the Patch Adams to films about mathematics and war. Totally inaccurate.I give it 1/10 because the acting is great, for what they're attempting to do. Truth-telling makes or breaks it for me, a computer scientist. If you're a young computer scientist or interested in this subject, get a more reliable source. Not this film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Fine story,"There are plenty of movies taking place during WW2, but this one definitely shows a different face of the war. It was interesting to see the story of the Enigma and go through Alan Turing's life.
The movie won an Oscar for its screenplay, which was actually really good and managed to keep me focused during the entire movie, although some may say that the plot is far from reality.
The actors had strong performance, with Benedict Cumberbatch being the one to really put out a great acting and really build a strong character.
I was not a fan of the effects, scenes or editing of the movie, but it is fine since the film was a highly acting-screenplay focused movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

"Excellent job, Cumberbatch!","The Imitation Game follows a history of the journey of a man called Alan Turing during the World War II in discovering a machine called ""Christopher"" that now would be called ""computers"". Alan Turing, played by Benedict Cumberbatch himself is a so-called genius student graduating from Cambridge, who then applied for a ""secret job"" for the government in order to win the war against Germany.He is one of some interns that got in, including a single, smart and pretty woman, Jean Clarke, played by Keira Knightley. Alan Turing found a chemistry with her, being able to talk to her the most than the other interns, but not in a romantic way. To make long story short, The British finally won the war because of the help of ""Christopher"" and in the end, they were asked to destroy it.Indeed Benedict Cumberbatch did a stunning performance playing an anti- social and odd prodigy in the film. Keira Knightley's appearance as a supporting artist was also quite well. The Imitation Game is a biography film that is able to capture its audience in such a perfect pace. It has the capability to make audience to feel it is just a mere movie, rather than a history-biography movie.Although there are some conversations I didn't agree to be very interesting, but overall it is a story that changes your perspective to see the ""odd"" ones. Truly, ""sometimes it is the people who no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Good movie but story not true.,"True Enigma code crackers were Jerzy Różycki, Marian Rejewski, Henryk Zygalski. They were Polish mathematicians and did that as early as of 1933 then handed over their discovery to British and French. Rejewski reconstructed Enigma machine that Polish intelligence intercepted. Zygalski made perforated sheets also known as Zygalski sheets required to reverse engineer Enigmas settings. Finally Różycki was the person who found mathematical methods to crack the code, first so called cyclometer for earlier Enigma version, later cryptographic bomb for new Enigma version (wrongly attributed to Alan Turing). There was a condition, after WWII British were obliged to acknowledge, who made the discovery. British scientist do so but English language mass media denies this fact for pure gain, and for sake of sales in this movie's case.

A good movie,"The Imitation Game is an excellent film. It tells the story of Alan Turing, a brilliant mathematician who broke the German code during World War II. It provides a fascinating insight into Turing's life and his pivotal role in the war effort. It is also a beautifully made film, with excellent performances by Benedict Cumberpatch and Keira Knightly. It is definitely a film to watch. The Imitation game is also a masterpiece of storytelling. It keeps the story moving at an intense pace, and it is full of twists and turns that keep the watcher engaged. The acting is superb, with a compelling performance by Benedict Cumberpatch as Turing. The Imitation Game is a thought-provoking and emotional film that will leave you with a deeper understanding of the importance of compassion, tolerance, and friendship. The Imitation Game is also a film about humanity and compassion. Turing's story is a heartfelt story of a genius whose ideas were shunned by society and a man whose sexual orientation led to his persecution. The film is a testament to the power of compassion and the value of tolerance. It is a film that speaks to our humanity and the importance of treating others with respect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A great story told through brilliant acting but a little confusing.,"Based on a true story, Turing is known as the man who broke the Engima code and saved years of more warfare. I hadn't known of his story and the connection he had with the war before, but I had heard of his name. So based on my limited knowledge, I found this movie quite interesting and compelling.With that said, I feel that the story was presented a little messily. It shows three points in time of Turing's life and though the one of his childhood is easily distinguishable as the past, I did not follow that they were showing two other points in his life; the time when he was working on the code, and the present. Perhaps I wasn't paying enough attention, but it really wasn't clear. This could also be because the British tend to have more subtle ways (for example in their humour), thus their films are more subtle as well.The acting was pretty brilliant. Benedict Cumberbatch whom I know from Sherlock but have never actually seen the show, was tremendous. His character is somewhat devoid of sympathy, and Cumberbatch shows that well, but at times when his character gets really emotional, that was when he was best. It was completely riveting. Knightley, Goode and Strong were great too. Strong has a natural talent to play a character that you cannot trust (not that he did in this movie), but his face just gives off that vibe. The chemistry between the characters were solid too.Also, I did not really understand some parts of the film. The thing with the Enigma code and machine kind of flew past my head at times. It wasn't that confusing but at the point of Eureka!, they were moving too fast for me to catch on. In addition, the conflict between Turing and John did not go into much detail and kind of just left it hanging.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Turing deserves a better legacy than this.,"It is Turing for Dummies. I am reminded of the Al Jolson story where they neglected to mention two of his four wives in his bio pic. The Poles made a huge initial contribution to tackling the Enigma problem. This film not only largely ignores that, but creates the impression Enigma was all that happened and Turing was running the whole show. The reality is a complex, compelling and far more thrilling story involving a collection of very clever people. There is no mention of Tommy Flowers. Tommy who? And what of the Lorenz traffic? What of Max Newman and John Tiltman. His team reverse engineered Lorenz without ever seeing one. It was an astounding intellectual exercise. Turing was a genius, one of many at Bletchley. I think he deserves better than this twaddle by numbers. I am surprised they didn't include a montage and a group of Bletchley staff walking in slow motion in front of a series of exploding Enigma machines. It is puerile lazy dross.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

The cinematography during the machine segments was engrossing, and the performances tied it all together. Cumberbatch portrays the complex genius superbly, with Knightley delivering an incredible performance as well.

a powerful portrait of a unique individual,"Alan Turing is an adroit mathematician and cryptanalyst who's given his most difficult assignment yet. In late 1930s England, he's recruited at Bletchley Park to join a team of analysts attempting to decipher Enigma, a seemingly unbreakable Nazi code that could help turn the tide of the war. The film chronicles Turing's dedication (arguably obsession) with his work, as well as the many trials and tribulations of his personal life. A compelling, insightful, at times painful portrait of one of the most brilliant minds of his generation with startling revelations, as well as a vivid sense of the time and place. Benedict Cumberbatch gives a powerful, heartbreaking performance in the lead, and is aided by a worthy supporting cast. ***",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
More than just a film about breaking the Enigma code,"The Imitation Game (2014) was directed by Morten Tyldum. The film is about a remarkable achievement--the breaking of the German naval Enigma code, considered by everyone to be unbreakable.Most of the events depicted in the film are historical facts--as I learned from Wikipedia after seeing the movie. (However, don't read the Wikipedia article first, because it may ruin the film if you do.)A mathematical genius named Alan Turing, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, broke the Enigma code by essentially inventing the computer. There was a woman named Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley) to whom Turing proposed. Social prejudice kept her from being a formal part of the code-breaking team, but she worked on the code with Turing informally.)We learn early in the movie that Turing was gay, and it appears obvious-- although not stated--that he had a condition somewhere along the autism spectrum.The film begins in media res--in 1951, when the police are investigating a break-in in Turing's home. That means that most of the scenes--Turing at school, and Turing working to break the code--are shown in flashback. This technique works, especially because the young actor playing Turing as a boy is excellent.How the break-in relates to the eventual outcome of the film wasn't at all clear to me. There was, indeed, a causal relationship, but if it was spelled out, I missed it. That's another matter that the Wikipedia article will clarify.I thought the acting in the movie was excellent, and the tension about breaking the Enigma code was almost palpable, even though we know that the code was broken. Sometimes director Tyldum is a little heavy-hand in telling us how important it was to intercept German messages. We see the code-breaking team staring glumly at another failed attempt, and then we see German tanks, or planes, or ships on the attack. Not exactly subtle.This isn't a great film, but I think it's definitely worth seeing. We saw it at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY, but it will work well on DVD.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Great movie, great lie.","This is excellent movie which presents a complete lie how enigma code was broken.

Too bad it so historically inaccurate (or maybe not giving credit where credit's due),"It is a good movie. Well paced, and so on and so forth... Unfortunately, there is almost no mention of Polish mathematicians who provided French and British Intelligence with all their documentation on cracking Enigma, plus ""home-made"" enigma machines. Let's see what really happened...German military texts enciphered on the Enigma machine were first broken by the Polish Cipher Bureau, beginning in December 1932. This success was a result of efforts by three Polish cryptologists, Marian Rejewski, Jerzy Różycki and Henryk Zygalski, working for Polish military intelligence. Rejewski ""reverse-engineered"" the device, using theoretical mathematics and material supplied by French military intelligence. Subsequently the three mathematicians designed mechanical devices for breaking Enigma ciphers, including the cryptologic bomb. From 1938 onwards, additional complexity was repeatedly added to the Enigma machines, making decryption more difficult and necessitating larger numbers of equipment and personnel—more than the Poles could readily produce.On 25 July 1939, in Warsaw, the Poles initiated French and British military intelligence representatives into their Enigma-decryption techniques and equipment, including Zygalski sheets and the cryptologic bomb, and promised each delegation a Polish- reconstructed Enigma. The demonstration represented a vital basis for the later British continuation and effort.During the war, British cryptologists decrypted a vast number of messages enciphered on Enigma. The intelligence gleaned from this source, codenamed ""Ultra"" by the British, was a substantial aid to the Allied war effort.So for purely entertaining value 9/10 but historical accuracy 3/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

No matter who you were and what you did - homosexuality was a big crime. Also being an ambitious woman so difficult in society then. We have come a long way with miles to go ahead. I feel sad for Turing's state-mandated hormonal treatment and subsequent alleged suicide.

The Enigma puzzle and the enigmatic genius.,"There is a film called 'Enigma' (2001), which is an action-adventure romp about code-breaking. It is a good film, worth watching, but perhaps a somewhat over-dramatised, and fictionalized, version of real-life events. 'The Imitation Game', whilst also using dramatic license, still retains much that is true, with few changes, to tell us a true story from World War II. It had remained secret until 1974. Film also puts centre-stage, Alan Turing, who played such a crucial part. As such therefore, this film, whilst having less action, is more down-to-earth and serious, and truthful, and thus is the better film.The film opens with some very good early scenes, that convey well the upheaval caused by the outbreak of the war. The crowd scenes are nothing new, but as time goes by, it must be harder to get the period details correct. The opening scenes, have that authenticity, as well as conveying the great social upheaval of the war. Not so much exciting, but rather impactful and panoramic. Good filming!Also seen in these early scenes is Londoner Benedict Cumberbatch, playing mathematician Alan Turing heading off for an interview. These early scenes, set the style for the rest of the film. Those fans of the TV comedy series 'The Big Bang Theory', featuring Jim Parsons as the obsessed socially-awkward genius Dr. Sheldon Cooper, will know what to expect, and will enjoy the comic similarities. Throughout much of this otherwise serious film, the tone is lightened by the behaviour of Alan Turing. Mr Cumberbatch may be playing a 'Cooper'-type character, but his portrayal is serious, and also so convincing, that we are utterly convinced that he is not playing, but is in fact, Alan Turing. The character is complex, the acting is of the very finest.Another fine performance is given by Keira Knightley playing the leading-female role of real-life character Joan Clarke. This is the third cinema release this year, in which this reviewer has seen Miss Knightley. Previously she played the wife of 'Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit' and later the talented Miss Knightley gave a delicate and exquisite performance in the musically-themed 'Begin Again'. Whilst that was good, her performance here in 'The Imitation Game' is arguably even better. Both Miss Knighley and Mr Cumberbatch play characters trapped by social-conventions. They convince us of the reality of their situation, and a great plot, and great writing, show us the impact, reality, and resolution, of those said situations.There is a good supporting cast, with strong performances from Charles Dance and Mark Strong. Matthew Goode, Rory Kinnear, and Allen Leech also gave good performances. It was good too, to see brief appearances by Steven Waddington, and Tuppence Middleton. It's always good to see Miss Middleton, as I have now, also for the third time this year. A brief appearance earlier in 'A Long Way Down', was followed by 'The Love Punch'. After her earlier lighter films, it is nice to see her get a small part in a serious film. Last, but by no means least, young Alex Lawther gives a performance that is truly outstanding. His role is an essential part of the film, and he plays his character so that it fits seamlessly into the rest of the film.My one gripe with this film, is it's non-chronological style. I am not a fan of this style, but although I can see why it was done, I still think it unnecessary. It delivers some exposition and a nice little understanding of an element of the story, but in reality, it is not essential. Chronology would still deliver the same impact. I assume the film-makers wished to concentrate on the life of Alan Turing rather than the Enigma story. The film title suggests this and refers partially to his AI test of computer v human.Alan Turing made an important contribution to science with his machines, one that is our legacy still in the computer-age present-day. There is now a museum, that is open to the public at Bletchley Park. The film glamourized the life led then. In reality, people worked long hours, girls collapsed from overwork, no talking was the rule.It is estimated that their work shortened the war by 2-4 years. War-time British Prime-Minister Winston Churchill said 'Ultra' was of the utmost importance in winning the war. The work started by Alan Turing eventually morphed from WWII Bletchley to GCHQ. Alan Turing was awarded an OBE in 1945 for his work. However his work remained secret. He wrote two papers; one on probability, the other on statistics of repetitions, both only released in 2012, they were that important, and thus that secret.This film does not require it's viewers to be scientists. The science part is easily explained and understood. What we have here is an exciting film about scientists going about their work. It was an exciting time. It was war-time. The logic of war is shown in the choices made and the decisions taken.'The Imitation Game' is rated in the UK as 12A for what are described as moderate sex-references. It is not a kids film. The subject-matter is serious. Whilst not an action film, this film does have scenes that show the reality of war.Many ordinary people made great sacrifices, and worked very hard in their roles during WWII. Brilliant minds, like those of Alan Turing, also fought the war in their own most effective way. It was a time summed up best by Winston Churchill, when he said on the 18th of June 1940 ""... if the British Commonwealth and Empire lasts for a thousand years, men will say, 'This was their finest hour.'""This film tells the true story of John Turing, and other scientists. Their story was secret for many years. This great film salutes him, and them. As do we. 9/10.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Sometimes it's the people who no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.,"I Was highly excited about The Imitation Game. Being a student in the field of Computer Science, I try not to miss biopics like this one. Overall it was a very good inspiring experience yet I must say it has quite many flaws. Maybe my expectations were too high. Anyways, have my utmost respect to Alan Turing whose work has been immensely influential in the field of computation and algorithms. Graham Moore's screenplay (adapted from 'Alan Turing : The Engima"") boosted by mesmerizing performance by Benedict Cumberbatch does great justice portraying the character of Alan Turing on the screen.The Imitation Game captures Alan Turing's life at three different stages. 1928-When Turing was in school, 1940-when he starts working at Bletchley park to crack the enigma and 1951-police investigation a robbery at Turing's place. While the part I was most excited about was the cracking of the enigma, which is an encryption device used by Germans for war-related communication during WWII. Turing with help of other mathematicians and experts at Bletchely Park like Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley) and Hugh Alexander (Matthew Goode) build the ""Bombe"", the machine for decryption of German messages so that English would know location of German attacks and plan accordingly. The film though kind highlights Turing a bit too much as if he did it all single handed but he indeed was the mastermind behind the implementation. The childhood part shows Turing's relation with his only good friend Cristopher among gangs of bullies. While the house robbery part of 1951 is where Turing gives account of all the events through his life as narrated in the film when he his being interrogated by the police. There is lot switching back and forth in the timeline of events, which wasn't necessary feeling like a poor trying- to-be-smart effort. There was a lot of potential with the enigma- cracking in the script to genuinely render smartness, unfortunately they only scratch the surface of it. I wished there was more math and actual computational terminology involved.Despite the main core of the film being the actual cracking of the enigma, the back and forth switches kind of kill the intensity and thrill. Also it made the narration lack focus. Keeping those things aside, it does not fail to imprint the glorious achievements of Turing in our minds. Benedict Cumberbatch has given an award-worthy performance in the tough race of outstanding actors in 2014. Keira Knightley was also surprisingly great and delightful to watch. The production design is top notch encapsulating the WWII time ideally. Alexandre Desplat's score is beautiful as most of his works. I was slightly disappointing having too high expectations, overall The Imitation Game is a thrilling,inspiring,charismatic but over- dramatized biopic.RATING: [3/5]",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A film carried by the strength of an actor and the intelligence of a writer,"The Imitation Game concerns Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch), an often unsung but wholly important figure of World War II, who worked as one of several code-breakers for Britain's secret Government Code and Cypher School. The men were a gaggle of mathematicians and linguists, who spent hours evaluating secret naval messages sent by the German's Enigma-software. Over three-thousand codes were sent through Enigma a day, and despite pervasive, around-the-clock work, the code was deemed ""unbreakable."" The Imitation Game follows Turing, an humble but ambitious man who worked to construct a machine to decode Enigma, as well as Turing's frequently abusive childhood, his relationship with Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley), a fellow-codebreaker, his other group members, and his personal recognition of his own homosexuality in a time when homosexuals were being charged with gross indecency.Alan Turing's story may be largely unknown by many people, but at least he has the honor of being played by Benedict Cumberbatch, one of the finest leading male actors working today. Much like his work in the now forgotten Fifth Estate last year, Cumberbatch is the stitching that holds The Imitation Game together, and makes the film more interesting than a film about code-breaking would suggest. He is meticulous in his portrayal of Turing, right down to mimicking his anxiousness and his often antisocial behavior, which would lead to him creating the Turing-Machine. Cumberbatch has always been an intriguing actor simply because he is eloquent and unpredictable in how he wants to approach the characters he plays, yet consistent in being a convincing screen-presence.Cumberbatch's acting ability is so strong he often distracts from some of The Imitation Game's lesser elements, such as the rather formulaic structure of the film, which cycles through flashbacks to tell stories in a vaguely disjointed manner. The film suffers from occasionally telling a remarkable story with either an indifference to the narrative structure or a foreseeable chronological timeline. Admittedly, however, screenwriter Graham Moore has quite the challenge at hand with The Imitation Game, as the material here isn't compelling in the traditional sense, and it's hard to concoct a great deal of suspense from a gaggle of guys trying to solve a cryptic message in one specific location. Because of this, Moore wisely decides to invite intrigue into the story rather than suspense, providing background to how Turing and company did their work and the meticulous process involved with cracking even a basic German message.In addition, The Imitation Game proves it's more of a thought-provoking, contemplative picture than anything when it shows off some of the year's most lackluster CGI in some of its action sequences. It's hard to place too much of an emphasis on the quality of the film's special effects, being that, again, the film is more about revealing the nature of the job of a code-cracker than anything else. However, the film features CGI that begs to be validated, as it almost looks as if the film was modeling itself after sequences taken from films over a decade old.Once again, though, it doesn't matter, for most people who will see The Imitation Game won't even bat an eye; they'll be too busy being completely amazed and captivated by the work of Cumberbatch and his ability to take a strange, off-kilter, but genius character and turn him into a human being through just a couple of scenes. Cumberbatch establishes Turing as not just an incredible man, but as a human, insecure, vulnerable, and unsure of himself when it comes to anything that doesn't involve his ability to create in just a few sequences, making most of the film centered on him and his issues for almost the entirety of its runtime. For an actor to not only be the foundation of a film, but the reason for the film's exceptional quality almost all around, sharing much of the glory with Moore, who competently structures the film around Turing as a human and works to make the film about the mystery of cracking the code, is quite the achievement.Starring: Benedict Cumberbatch, Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, Mark Strong, and Charles Dance.

Compelling story marred by an overly melodramatic approach !!!!,"The positives are Benedict Cumberbatch (of course) and a non-linear screenplay which is innovative(for a biopic).The film made me aware of a great man whose unbelievable achievements and gifts to mankind I was completely unaware of(as were most viewers).But the problem with the film for me is the style of storytelling and direction. In order to make this a film suitable for everyone in the family,the director almost completely took off all the hard edges of the storyline which made the film look like a TV film. There are too many clichéd characters like the ones played by Charles Dance,Keira Knightley,etc. It reminded me of ""A Beautiful Mind"" although that was a much better film. It is just too melodramatic and abundant with Hollywood clichés almost reminiscent of The King's Speech.It is still a good film, but I expected much more from a movie that has been lauded by so many critics. However, its sappy,sugarcoated nature will make it a contender at the Oscars.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"UK Actors Rule in Film and TV, The Imitation Game is no Exception","The Imitation Game was a very good movie. I like UK films and UK actors. They hone their craft well. For drama nothing beats their abilities. Perhaps it comes from their extensive education, theater and TV background before moving on to film. However, when I think of the great movies and TV shows coming out of Hollywood today most of the actors seem to be of UK origin. I'm thinking David Oyelowo in Selma, Eddie Redmayne in The Theory of Everything, Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage in the Hobbit, Rosamund Pike in Gone Girl, Rachel Weisz in Interstellar, Sam Heughan, Caitriona Balfe, Tobias Menzies and Graham McTavish from Outlander just to list a few this season that blew me away.In The Imitation Game, we get several great UK actors as well: Benedict Cumberbatch does a fabulous job as Alan Turing. He plays the introverted yet flawed genius of Alan Turning to perfection. I feel not enough credit is going to Keira Knightley who played Joan Clarke the only woman on the team, her character was a genius in her own right who would not have been taken seriously except for Turning. Keira has the ability to transform herself into whatever role she's asked to take on, and this one is no exception. She is what makes Turing's character understandable and likable. If not for his relationship with her, Benedict would not have a vehicle to show his vulnerable side in this movie, and it is that side which we come to relate to the terrible tragedy of his life. Other actors of note in The Imitation game were, Matthew Goode as Hugh Alexander, Matthew plays the charming, handsome, likable man on the team who balances the performance by Cumberbatch and I thought Alex Lawther as the young Alan Turing turned in a great performance and gave you an understanding as to why Turning became like he was.The movie plot was well done, interesting story line. As a mathematician and computer scientist I knew of Turning's contribution to the field of computational mathematics and computer science. I, like many, probably knew little about his life, his involvement in the WWII, nor his homosexuality and what the government of the day did to him because of it. It was indeed an enlighten story from many aspects. We see how people of difference not only make amazing contributions to our society if allowed to, but also how governments make life and death choices every day some for the good of mankind, some bad because of the prejudices of the times. I think this story has many lessons for all of us. I strongly recommend this film. It's a must see for all this season.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Now in my top 10 of all time,"Its a fabulous movie. Enormously well crafted. Full of emotional moments, gravitas, humor.

Do yourself a favor and learn more about the man who set the foundation for the modern-day computer  and a significant contributor to ending a World War.,"It's officially that time of year — we hear the Oscar nominations and quickly schedule time to catch up on the nominated actors, screenwriters, directors and movies before February 22. There are always some surprises and some let downs  and I automatically assumed The Imitation Game would be in the ""let down"" category. My favorite work of Benedict Cumberbatch is limited to a Jimmy Kimmel ""Mean Tweets"" sketch (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y1iErgBrDQ)  and that's about it. Simply put, I avoided this movie until absolutely necessary because I assumed it would be boring and pretentious.And you know what happens when you assume right?Yes my friends — I was WRONG. Very wrong. This is one of the best movies of 2014 and very much deserves The Academy praise.Go see it.I know, I know. It's another WWII movie. And it's British accents. And it's not starring (insert favorite Hollywood crush here). Go. This movie is about so much more than a WWII strategy that experts say ended the war at least 2 years earlier than if it didn't happen (2 years of lives saved!) It's about so much more than a genius that had zero social skills. It's so much more than seeing some of your Downton Abbey characters NOT talk about Matthew (inside joke for you Downton fans).In 114 minutes The Imitation Game provides a fascinating history lesson on newly released classified WWII history. (FYI – some stretching of history of course for the silver screen  after you see the movie check out this article -- http://www.wired.com/2014/11/imitation- game-secrets/ -- sharing some ""secrets"" from the screenwriter.) In 114 minutes you also learn about the man that inspired the work of great geniuses we know today — Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, etc. Alan Turning, played by Cumberbatch, is truly the founder of modern-day computers. While there are many outstanding people that took his work to create the computer, tablets and phones we use today, he started with the blank sheet of paper knowing ""a smart machine"" could be possible. His name needs to be included in our conversations about technology.If you are an Apple geek, you may already know the (rumored) connection between Turning / Apple's logo / Steve Jobs. Just google ""Steve Jobs Alan Turning"" and you'll see the pages upon pages of articles over the years suggesting that Apple's 'bitten apple' logo was honoring the death of Alan Turning. Jobs said ""God we wish it was"" in response. A CNN article from 2011 (http://www.cnn.com/2011/10/06/opinion/apple-logo/) goes through some of the rumors and reactions from what Jobs called an urban legend. No one but Steve (and Woz perhaps?) really know.I'd like to believe Jobs & Turning are smiling down on all of us as we silence our iPhones to learn about this great strategy of WWII history through the eyes of The Imitation Game. If you enjoy your computer, your smart phone, your tablet — do yourself a favor and learn more about the man who set the foundation for these life-changing machines  and a significant contributor to ending a World War.

private and public battles,"The heroic and the tragic tale of Alan Turing has long been Britain's (not-so) secret shame, a wrong that has recently been righted by representations such as The Imitation Game. Benedict Cumberbatch gives an award-bait performance in bringing Turing's odd genius to life. All the cast are convincing, with Mark Strong as an MI6 agent being especially charismatic. The period is solidly evoked by the stand-up production design, and the script, while slightly too expositional, manages to straddle three time periods in Turing's life, noting how the imperative to conceal his homosexuality crippled him socially. Technically the film maintains a high standard, though there is nothing outstanding in the direction. The cracking of the Enigma Code is arguably the greatest achievement of the British war effort. The personal cost to the man we have to thank is a stunning tale, especially given the secrecy it has been cloaked in for most of the 20th century. In sum, this is a very good biopic that entertains, informs and does justice to Turing's legacy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Contemporary themes in a historic spy thriller,"This excellent movie will finally put an overdue spotlight on Alan Turing, OBE, and his historic work during World War II. The Imitation Game is an interesting story, especially relevant because it's based on intelligence information kept secret for decades post World War II. Adding to the intrigue, the history and the superb performances by Benedict Cumberbatch, who portrays the British mathematician Alan Turing and a brilliant cast, the movie also confronts the controversial issue of the cruel, archaic and now illegal practice of treating homosexuality. This movie will be studied and discussed for many years because of the social themes entwined in the plot. Highly recommended viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A poor depiction,"Perhaps this is one of the most surprising films of 2014, because it has left me a great disappointment. I heard of the name of AlanTuring the first time around 5 years ago when reading a book named The Code Book by Simon Singh. This book dedicates a whole chapter to a encrypting machine called Enigma, including some of achievements of breaking down it done by Polish decryption experts in the period just prior to WWII, and achievements from the legendary Bletchley Park in Britain during WWII. Alan Turing is the most prominent figure at that time, no doubt. I also learnt about Turing afterward, and has taken some liking to him since then, a short-lived genius.And Turing in The Imitation Game is quite different. It's a Turing who is dramatized terribly in a movie which is dramatized even more. To the extent of phoniness. Turing (the character in the movie) is described as a super-hero who engages in the most intellectually quintessential place of Britain at that time. Ignore the fact that the movie depicts Turing mistakenly and exaggeratedly, just mention the logic behind the plot. The story of Turing (the character) and his partners' achievements is similar to a tale of being hinted by some god in a summer night. So right in the beginning Turing (the character) rushes into sketching a machine which would be used to break down the Enigma, while during the movie progress there are no suggestions for us to know what is based upon or who he is inherited from in order to create that machine. There is only a mention of Polish in an early scene in the movie as smugglers who slipped the Enigma machine into Britain. And afterward, Turing (the character) and his partners act as God, just do it and achieve it.The movie is overstated and inflated dramatically from the plot to dialogs, which easily arouse viewers' emotion, as a line in the movie spoken by Turing (the character), ""it's because it feels good"". But for me, also copying another line right after (spoken by Turing the character too): sometimes I can't enjoy what supposedly feels good, I have to think what is logical, which really and truly feels good.About a mathematics genius, an alleged father of computer science and artificial intelligence, the movie just delivers some hollow feelings. Alan Turing, I would meet you only through words and books.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Cumberbatch is terrific but the film itself is a jumbled piece of storytelling,"Alan Turning, the man, the legend...he single handedly built the world's first computer and helped win WWII for the Allies due to his discoveries only to be sought out as a spy when in reality the only double life he was leading was that of a homosexual. The Imitation Game chronicles his discovery and his ultimate medical torture as British Parliament tries to ""rid him"" of his homosexuality. This is a heart wrenching biopic that really is a mere showcase of how good Benedict Cumberbatch is as an actor. Despite this very talented showcase, The Imitation Game achieves very little during its two hour runtime other than letting us know, sometimes a bit too heavily, that Cumberbatch is an amazing actor. Working from Graham Moore's impeccable BlackList script, Morten Tyldum tries to make this film more of an espionage thriller but it couldn't be further from that. The Imitation Game is a character study and straight biopic that falls into the well treaded clichés that make up the genre. The story is slow moving, and extremely jumbled as it jumps from 1951 to 1939 a little too often, making it very hard to end up caring about each storyline in their own rights. While I commend Tyldum's work here with his actors, he misses the mark in telling this engaging story. Instead, he throws most of the load on Cumberbatch. Any other actor would have probably crumbled under such pressure but Cumberbatch rises to not only give the performance of his career but the performance of a decade. Cumberbatch as Turning isn't very likable, but he is articulate, shy and extremely intelligent and Cumberbatch uses that to his advantage. His performance as Turning is somber, articulate and intelligent, much like the man he is portraying. It is a marvelous performance that makes the film worth watching based solely on that. The supporting cast is decent here, Kiera Knightley is very good in this film as she plays Joan Clarke, a woman that tries desperately to get close to Turning throughout the course of the 1939 storyline. Other actors include Matthew Goode, Charles Dance and Mark Strong. Each of them are decent in their roles but pale in comparison to Cumberbatch. Overall, while The Imitation Game may have one of the best performances of the year in it, it doesn't make up for its jumbled narrative.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A Worthy Celebration of Geniuses,"The secrets behind the true victors of World War II were only divulged not too long ago (interestingly enough, it's hard to come by the exact date of the reveal). This tale is about Alan Turing, a brilliant mathematician who went on to break the Nazis' enigma code and help win the war. Now, there's always that one Oscar-bait film every year that I like much more than I expected. Unlike the rubbish biopics like The Theory of Everything, The Imitation Game actually celebrates the genius. It doesn't try to sentimentally conclude that there's a genius in everyone (because there's frankly not)—not another inspiring story about how everyone can achieve monumental achievements just like Stephen Hawking and Alan Turing. It was very clear from the beginning that Turing wasn't ""normal""—that he deviated from other people for a reason. Normality usually never ends with a tremendous legacy; it's the people who were ignored or unappreciated during their lifetime—the people who were condemned; the people who really didn't care about expectations and general rules—that eventually reach glory. In this case, it takes fifty years for Turing's vast accomplishments to finally be disclosed to the public—let the countless biographic novels and films about him now come.Benedict Cumberbatch's sheer charisma never appears to end as he, once again, encapsulates another sort of personality—the socially inept loner whose solely logical mind and utter arrogance centers on one goal, one total passion of his: the sizable computing machine he's building to crack the impossibly indecipherable German messages. (Keep in mind I've never seen the Sherlock series; so, I'm totally new to this refreshing side of Cumberbatch after seeing him portray a frighteningly menacing villain in last year's Star Trek sequel.) This might sound like typical Oscar-bait material, but it sometimes also largely depends on the particular film's execution. Take 2010's The King's Speech, for instance; what could've easily been another Oscar- checklisting inspirational narrative ended up transcending its material with absolutely believable and natural characters and performances that suck you in beyond any failures in the story's quality and lack of inventiveness.Again, unlike The Theory of Everything (which I have a feeling I'll be knocking down more and more as this review proceeds), we don't hear a lot of that soapy, Lifetime music that shadows the emotional moments. Alexandre Desplat's score here is incredibly emotional without the help of some manipulative, weeping piano notes. The music takes more of the tone of a grand, majestic story, or occasionally perhaps something that makes it feel more like a spy thriller rather than a standard soap opera. Another admirable trait of the film that further defied my expectations was the integrity that stayed with Turing's character to the bitter end; he never loses his conceit or eccentric personality. That clichéd Hollywood arc of character development (the distant bigot suddenly becomes a compassionate benefactor a la Dallas Buyer's Club) thankfully can't be found here. Right from the get-go, Graham Moore's impeccably sharp screenplay wastes no time in shaping these characters, especially Turing, himself, who's given a few humorous scenes to profoundly introduce himself to the audience. Kiera Knightley plays opposite Cumberbatch as an intelligent, dignified woman in the midst of a male- concentrated environment in a male-dominated time period. The dynamic between Cumberbatch and Knightley's Joan Clarke is sweet and amusing; there's no need for a traditional romantic interest/shallow plot line since this relationship is strictly platonic (and Turing, of course, is homosexual anyway).The complexity and intricateness of the heavily mathematical, scientific code-breaking concept of The Imitation Game is satisfyingly condensed so that the plot doesn't continue with frustrating convolution that of which frequently hinders many spy thrillers. Personally, a great screenplay can always simplify complicated ideas to the extent that it still feels natural and realistic. With all that being said, the script does tend to deliver some of the film's themes quite heavy-handedly in moments to the point of that sappiness that's become a staple of Oscar-bait biopics. Reciting the same line several times throughout the picture as to persist that thematic idea (""Sometimes, it is the people who no one imagines anything of, who do the things that no one can imagine"") usually doesn't work, impacting with a mawkish taste rather than with sincerity.On another note, while I appreciated the inclusion of the disarmingly tragic conclusion to Turing's story, it seemingly glossed over it all as if in a rush to avoid a lingering gloomy mood to close on. The Imitation Game, regardless, is fully effective in its shuffling of undoubtedly significant subjects, including topical mentions of homosexual ostracism (and worse, punishment) and the important technological advancements of mankind—the capability of the human mind and the lengths of its imagination—and how much that has all reshaped our worldfrom then to now. Most of all, as the credits roll and the beautiful score surfaces, your eyes water for the men and women that lived in stress and died without recognition or appreciation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

"Fascinating story, well told, well acted and worth seeing","OK, so it's not 100% accurate, but if you go to see just about any WWII Hollywood movie, the Americans won the war singlehandedly. This movie is about one scientist who was credited by no less an authority than Winston Churchill as the man who made the single greatest contribution to winning the war. It's well worth seeing. Benedict Cumberbatch channels a similar character to the one he played as Sherlock Holmes in the British TV mini series. There are a couple of very unsubtle suggestions that he was on the Autistic/Asbergers spectrum - firstly in his very literal responses in his interview for Bletchley Park, and inability to look the interviewer in the eye. Then if you missed those clues, an even less subtle separation of food colours on his plate. It's an easy device to explain single minded, focused genius used in a growing number of movies recently (think Social Network). Keira.Knightley is convincing in her role, as are the other supporting actors. The switching back and forth between 3 different timelines got slightly annoying after a while. But these are minor quibbles. If you want historical accuracy, read a book or watch a YouTube documentary on Turing or the Enigma team.

Excellent Performances and Strong Story,"The Imitation Game (2014)**** (out of 4)Excellent mixture of drama and thriller takes place during WWII where mathematician Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) is hired by the British government to try and break Hitler's enigma code, which could lead to the war ending. Throughout the drama of trying to break the code, Turing begins a relationship with a co-worker (Keira Knightley) while trying to keep his homosexuality a secret.THE IMITATION GAME is without question one of the best movies of the year and it works on so many levels. It's rather sad to think that Turing wasn't better known or respected during his short life time and it's even sadder when one realizes why he didn't live very long. I'm not going to spoil any of these true-story events but I think what I respected most about this picture is that it managed to give a strong message without having to preach. More on that in a bit but the film also contains some of the best drama you're going to see and some incredible performances that bring it all together.Cumberbatch turns in one of the strongest performances of his career in a very challenging role. The Turing character is one you hate at times. Egotistical. Mean-spirited. Caring. A mad genius if you will. There's so much going on with this character and his brain is racing a mile a second yet Cumberbatch manages to keep all of this stuff under control and give a very memorable performance. What was so remarkable about it is that he's playing a genius and he really makes you feel as if you're watching the real guy and seeing these events unfold in front of your eyes. There's a sequence towards the end of the film where we see Turing crumbling and just the look in Cumberbatch's eyes are unforgettable. Knightley turns in another terrific performance proving why she's one of the best actresses out there. Matthew Goode, Matthew Beard, Rory Kinnear and Tom Goodman-Hill are all wonderful as well.Director Morten Tyldum does a wonderful job at taking the various aspects of the story and making them all work. The screenplay jumps around from the events in WWII to Turing's childhood and then his later years. The subplot dealing with a detective trying to break Turing is extremely well-balanced with the rest of the film. Usually when films jump around like this you can lose certain bits of tension but that never happens here. Even more impressive is the wonderful music score, the excellent cinematography and some wonderful costumes. On a technical level the film is quite flawless and even the CGI isn't bad looking even though it's rarely used.Getting back to the preaching, it's rather sad to see what happened to Turing and there's certainly a political and social message here. A lot of films really would have beaten the viewer over the head but instead this film just lets it sink in that this brilliant man was cut short for the dumbest of reasons. It's rather sad to think of what could have been with this genius and the film makes you think of that. THE IMITATION GAME is certainly one of the year's strongest films.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The Imitation Game,"Whilst I did enjoy this telling of the wartime efforts of the British code-breakers at Bletchley Park, I think I prefer Sir Derek Jacobi's 1996 interpretation of the achievements of Alan Turing, the brilliant mathematician who led a team of enigmatic individuals who broke the Nazi ""Enigma"" code. Benedict Cumberbatch is really just reprising his BBC ""Sherlock"" characterisation - even down to the pensive hand gestures. The story is told from quite an interesting retrospection after the pretty unlikeable Turing has been apprehended by the police for what I suppose we'd call ""lewd behaviour"" nowadays and is being questioned by Rory Kinnear (""Detective Nock""). Indeed, I found all the characterisations to be a bit shallow - Charles Dance, Keira Knightley and Matthew Goode just lacked oomph, I thought. Fascinating story , though - beautifully well presented.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A MUST See to understand the reason we live free,"Based upon a true storyDuring WWII math genius Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) leads a team of cryptologists to crack the German codes from the Enigma machine. Cracking of these German codes helped shorten WWII and saved millions of lives.It is more than a shame that the Academy could not see that there were 2-movies (the other one being the Theory of Everything) that were equally deserving of an Oscar for Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Director and Best anything else. The Imitation Game is wholly important because of Turing's building a machine that could decode Enigma, and, of course, the importance of Stephen Hawking's brilliance in science theories. What's wrong with having 2-movies share Oscars? Nothing. So there!There are 2-stories in here. One dealing with decoding the Enigma machine and the other having to do with his homosexuality which was a crime. in England. It was just talked about. We see nothing uncomfortable within. Too many critics are complaining that this was not presented in a more open way. The real story here is the impact and decoding of Enigma and the effects on the whole world.Detective Nock (Rory Kinnear) a local police detective believed there was something wrong with Turing when he investigated a break-in at Turing's house. The detective could not find anything in Turing's background including anything military, and suspected that he was a German spy. In the end Turing was charged with indecent exposure and agreed to Chemical Castration instead of going to jail. We see flashbacks to when Alan Turing was a student at a boy's school and meeting Christopher. Later Turing names his decoding machine Christopher.The whole production is first rate and Cumberbatch does an excellent job portraying Turning. The whole cast performed well enough to have this movie win Oscars (note plural). Notables included Mark Strong, Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, and Charles Dance.Still the most important thing about this is the ENIGMA STORY itself. What happened during that time whether it concerned the Polish who were the first to decode Enigma or Turing's participation this must be HIT HOME: We live the way we do because of what happened during that time by all those involved. End of story. A great line by Joan Clark (Knightley) to Turning: ""the world is an infinitely better place because of what you did."" So true.Since every time we get a ""True Story"" we really never know the whole truth about certain aspects. That is why those still interested in Alan Turing and Enigma should go to Wikipedia to learn more. And maybe those who do that will get a better appreciation of Alan Turing and of those who helped decode the Enigma machine.Alan Turing committed suicide in 1954 and it is believed he bit into an apple laced with cyanide. Some say that Steve Jobs used the apple (with that bite) logo in honor of Alan Turing who became instrumental in the development of computers. (10/10)Violence: Not really.

Even worse than Enigma,"If you know nothing about Alan Turing or the history of Bletchley Park, or you think ""World War II"" was a sequel to ""World War"", I suppose you might enjoy this film. However, if you are at all familiar with the history of Enigma or the life of Turing, my advice would be to give this an even wider berth than that nonsense with Dougray Scott.Why Hollywood thinks that the Enigma story is so dull that they have to dress it up this way is beyond me. I laughed out loud several times, and not at anything funny. The script piles cliché on cliché and I found the whole experience embarrassing and rather offensive. Alan Turing was a complex and difficult individual, but here he is reduced to a comical cardboard cut-out. Charles Dance chewing the scenery as a ridiculous caricature of Alistair Denniston, an even more ludicrous villain than Alan Rickman as the Sheriff of Nottingham, was too much to bear.I couldn't think what ""The Imitation Game"" reminded me of for several hours, until I realized it was the inspired 1980s Comic Strip spoof ""The Strike"", in which a miner's memoire of the 1984 miners' strike is bastardized by a Hollywood studio for ""dramatic effect"", with Al Pacino parachuted in as union leader Arthur Scargill. Sadly, ""The Imitation Game"" didn't set out to be a spoof, though the end result is as much a biopic of Alan Turing as ""Carry on Cleo"" is a biopic of Julius Caesar.There is a reason why Enigma is not on sale on DVD in the gift shop at Bletchley Park. I can't imagine they are in a great rush to clear space on the shelves for The Imitation Game either.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"A Beautiful Mind meets The Social Network, A Brilliant Masterpiece","In The Imitation game Benedict Cumberbatch plays Alan Turing, the real life man responsible for cracking the Natzi Enigma machine. The Enigma machine was a code encrypting device that helped the Natzis communicate with what was then known as an unbreakable code. Alan is called upon by the British government's MI6 along with a crack team of brilliant minds. Alan is very quirky genius who rubs everyone the wrong way. Along with the way he brings on Joan Clark (Keira Knightly) to help, when he finds her in an open invitation puzzle contest he places in a paper. Alan and his team race against time to build a machine that will eventually crack the code and help allied forces triumph over the Natzis and end World War II. I have to admit this type of movie looked like something I would normally avoid. Something about British period pieces puts me to sleep. I am not a fan of Downton Abbey, can't bring myself to find it entertaining. I am also less than a fan of Benedict Cumberbatch, I used to find him odd and off putting. How does that guy have droves of female fans? I just didn't get it. I must now go on record as saying Imitation Game is a game changer for me. This film had everything you want in a great film; brilliant insight into little know bits of history that as of recently were top secret, smart funny dialogue, heartbreaking personal drama and brilliant acting performances all around. There is a repeated quote throughout the film ""Sometimes it is the people who no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine."" I can't imagine a better performance in this role better than Cumberbatch. His social awkwardness and introverted portrayal of Alan Turing is transcendent. I am now sold on the brilliance of Cumberbatch. Together he and Keira Knightly make cinematic magic in transporting us to a very important and little know piece of world history. Without Alan Turing there would not be the modern computer we enjoy today. Plus we might all be speaking German. This movie at its roots is about communication. The coded, encrypted way we communicate as society. Most wars and disagreements stem from a lack of one side or another to communicating clearly. There is a lot to learn in the message of this film. The Imitation Game is nominated for best picture and acting nods for both Cumberbatch and Knightly, and rightfully so. This movie is a must see film of 2014.If you enjoyed this review, please check out my blog at yourturntopick.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A remarkable take on Alan Turing's life,"In different ways whether we are aware of it, computers have influenced a lot on the way how we live in this world. As a person who have been at some point interested with computers, I have come across a person named ""Turing"" alongside with ""von Neumann"", ""Pascal"", etc. He's one of the brilliant minds in the history of computers. Mix this person with the themes of war such as cryptography, the Nazis, and ""top-secret"" operations, will lead to an interesting topic to talk about; topic that is usually made into ""B"" movies. You can have it at the ""Imitation Game"", but then in one of the unusual cases, we encounter here a film that is more than a thrilling ""B"" movie with similar theme.We get to know ""Enigma"", a machine built by Germans to encrypt and decrypt secret codes. The codes when decrypted by the Allied forces will greatly increase their chance to win the war against the Nazis, who dominated Europe during the second World War. If you are thinking that war between humans and machines is something futuristic, this film shows us that it has already happened in the middle of the 20th century. It happened, as the way how the film put it, between the brilliant minds of Britain and a German machine; and this led to a question: how can humans beat a powerful machine? Turing's answer was simple: build another machine. Of course, realizing this adversary machine to beat Enigma is such a risky endeavor that will require a lot of brain resources. This is the struggle that the film tackled at its core together with the different dimensions that come alongside it.We might expect some mathematics, but then the treatment is almost the same as that of ""A Beautiful Mind"". However, this film has a more sophisticated and realistic take on telling the story of an unusual person. What is even more compelling is that it is a well-crafted mix of victory and tragedy. We get to see the impact of the war and the personal struggles of those who were tasked to solve the ""puzzle"" at Bletchley Park. Among those struggles, we get to realize that Alan Turing's life was far from the story of a victorious war hero. We get to see how harsh the society can be to those who are considered different and how somebody can lose his purpose despite the gift and achievements. We see all of this accompanied by the remarkable performances of Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley and the above average technical achievements. What can be easily recognized to be topnotch are the film's cinematography and music.It's not wholly entertaining though because it can be a bit slow at times and uninteresting. If you are looking for some engaging academic discourse about computers and war strategies, you might not get your fix because it tends to tackle the social dimension more and it can be inaccurate at times in historical details. And in the last part, it felt like there is some imbalance though since earlier we get to see its matter-of-fact and neutral treatment on the more sensitive matters.At the bottom-line, I think the film succeeds in its in-depth take on a person whose purpose in life was not fully realized amidst his/her gifts. Overall, it is a memorable film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Horrible travesty,"If you'd like to learn about Alan Turing, read Andrew Hodges' definitive biography, 'The Enigma'.Steer clear of this movie. It's filled with inaccuracies small and large. It's a complete waste of time.g.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Very enjoyable even if vastly inaccurate,"I have been very anxious to watch the Imitation Game especially since I so deeply enjoyed the book/biography on which it was supposedly based: ""Alan Turing: The Enigma"" by Andrew Hodges. The movie is overall well directed, performances are good - in some cases exceptional (see Cumberbatch as Alan Turing)- but the script deviates so much from the original story that I wish I hadn't read the book first.The movie presents the story of Alan Turing and the agonizing work of a team of coders at Bletchley Park as they try to crack the Enigma, the machine used by Nazi forces to transmit encrypted messages for the various aspects of the war operations.Alan Turing, a truly enigmatic and complex character (the movie only scratches the surface of his personality)is presented as more or less singlehandedly leading the attack to the Enigma. In reality, crucial contributions have been made by a Polish team who were already able to break the Enigma before the outbreak of the war (they handed their knowledge to French and English) and thanks to either pure luck (see German mistakes) or pure heroism (see dedicated missions to the Atlantic to retrieve Enigma machines).Alan Turing's work was indeed brilliant, following up on the insights he provided in his key scientific contribution - the universal machines - and the upgraded (compared to the Poles) ""Bombes"" machine that he helped design.The brilliance of his, and his co-workers' at Bletchley, work is diminished in the film in rather simplistic, ""hollywood"" style revelations. On the other hand his role is vastly upgraded with regards to decision-making about how to use the knowledge of the broken Enigma messages - something he never took part in. I honestly wonder what good these deviations from his true role really do.Speaking of deviations and inaccuracies, pretty much every character that appears in the film is either misplaced in time, role, story or in terms of interaction with Turing. Moreover the difficulties and importance of Hut 8 work, are significantly misrepresented - mostly confined in false power-plays, spy-hunts and melodrama, while the true pathogeneses of the British war machine are completely overlooked.Last but not least, the way the movie treats Turing being a homosexual is absolutely out of the actual framework of the period he lived in and of his own perception for it. The arrest/detective/interrogation scenes are wildly imaginative with no apparent reason - in terms of helping to build Turing's character in the film - and the insights on his teenage years are not adequately projected.Notwithstanding all the deviations mentioned above, the film does succeed in creating an engaging atmosphere and I assume that for those who never heard of the actual story before it must have a strong impact.7 out of 10 for the ""final product"" noting the immense deviation from the actual story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Well Done Drama,"The Imitation Game is the kind of film where it hits all the right notes. The script is excellent, the actors brilliant, and the directing on point. There are no real surprises to this story, but it pleases from the quality of an interesting biopic.The film is set in World War II England, and follows the story of Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch), Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley), and other code-breakers as they attempt to break the Nazi's code machine, enigma. The film starts with events from after the war, where Alan Turing is arrested from homosexual activity, and flashes back to his time during the war and his time at school as a boy.The Imitation Game reminded me of Argo in terms of the type of film it is. They are both about an event from history that most people probably haven't read too much about. And they are great stories and translate to the screen very well. The Imitation Game had a great chance for Best Picture because it did everything just right. It did not win because there were a few more daring films in the mix.Quite simply though, The Imitation Game is a well done drama.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
I'm glad that the director brought this story to light! 7/10,"Review: I quite enjoyed this movie because of its well written script, which was witty in places and the great acting from the cast. The subject matter was also interesting and quite shocking because it's not public knowledge, until now. Its about a super intelligent individual who joins the British Intelligence Agency to break a Nazi code. He also has the help from some intelligent code breakers who help him build an extraordinary machine which, eventually saves millions of life's. I loved the banter between Charles Dance and Cumberbatch at the beginning and the shocking reason to punish him for being gay, was touching. The chemistry between the characters, really worked well and the storyline had a great mixture of elements which kept the movie interesting. What also amazed me was that this is a true story which actually happened during the war against Hitler. The sad think is that Alan Turing will never get the praise that he truly deserves, just because he was gay and he sadly committed suicide at they young age of 41. Anyway, it's a great story which is portrayed well by the director and the actors and I personally think that everyone should know what this genius achieved. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Its obvious that this extremely intelligent man was way ahead of his time because he really did build the first computer which is much used today in everyone's day to day lives in a modern society. He was given the choice to either go to prison for 2 years or undergo hormonal treatment so he picked to stay out of jail but the treatment was rotting away his body. At 41, he dipped an apple in cyanide and ate it, which killed him instantly. This is not shown in the film but I'm glad that I watched the bonus footage on the DVD to learn more about the man himself. I can only imagine what he could achieve today because everyone in the world has some form of technology in there life. Anyway, as a movie, I learnt a lot about a very interesting individual and I'm glad that the director showed the different aspects of his life. Charles Dance and Mark Strong were great additions to the cast and the geniuses that were working with Alan Turing were believable and we'll acted. In all, I really enjoyed the film and I'm glad that the director brought this story to light.Budget: $14million Worldwide Gross: $200millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their deep dramas about a extremely intelligent man who builds a device to crack the Nazi Enigma machine which saved millions of life's. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Homo Propaganda,"This is textbook socialist propaganda. You're led to believe you're going to watch a movie about WWII and the breaking of the enigma code. It sounds interesting and draws you in. But once you're invested in the movie, the pushing of the homosexual agenda begins, slowly at first, and gradually increasing in intensity until it's fully unleashes a storm of brain-raping material that would make marx envious. Don't mistake this for gay-bashing. Propaganda repulses any free-thinking individual. If you're gay, you'll probably love this movie and give it rave reviews because you're bias blinds you. If you're into history, you'll probably be insulted and so you'll want to read a book.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Outstanding Cumberbatch Performance,"25 November 2014 Fiona's First Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - The Imitation Game. Benedict Cumberbatch made a shrewd move when he took on the role of Alan Turing in this film. Based on the true story of one the finest mathematical minds of his time, Turing is employed at Bletchley Park as part of a team charged with breaking the Enigma Code, and saving millions of lives. As with a lot of clever minds, he is grossly under appreciated and comes close to having the plug pulled on the whole project. Cumberbatch brings his own special qualities to what was a tortured mind, in a person persecuted not only for being more clever than those around him from a very young age, but also ultimately persecuted for his homosexuality, something that was illegal and punishable by law in his lifetime. Kiera Knightley played Joan, the only woman in an otherwise all male team and many will recognise Allen Leech, the lovely Branson from Downton Abbey as a fellow great brain in Turing's team. Another person to note is the detective, Robert Nock, played by the simply wonderful Rory Kinnear, who looks more like his father every day. This was a very watchable portrayal of the top secret events that occurred at Bletchley Park during the Second World War.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Good movie, but I would have liked a little more truth in the telling","The danger of an interesting movie based on true events is that one is likely to run to wikipedia to discover the whole story, only to discover that the whole story has very little to do with the movie.Such is the case with The Imitation Game. While there was, in fact, a genius named Alan Turing who worked on breaking the Nazi's enigma machine, but while the film was entertaining, liberties were taken that to me seem both unnecessary and disappointing.I'd say the biggest issue was the creation of an antagonist for Turing (which apparently really upset the family of the antagonist). The obtuse, hard-headed boss is nothing but a cliché, and while the writer may have felt it created a nice dramatic tension, for me it was a little annoying in the movie and very annoying when I found out it was fiction.When asked about the way the script strayed from the truth, the screenwriter compared himself with Monet. Besides being wildly egotistical, it's a false analogy. Monet was not using waterlilies to make a greater statement about politics or gay oppression, he was experimenting with colors. He wasn't touting the fact that waterlilies exist in the real world to raise interest in his paintings; he used them as a vehicle for his art. The screenwriter said that, like Monet, he wanted to give the feeling of Turing's life, but his changes seem more designed for creating a pat but effective conventional narrative rather than to create a feel.I can understand not following anyone's life exactly - life is too messy for a movie - but to me it seems if you're going to veer this much from truth you are better off just writing fiction.My advice; if you watch this movie, which is quite engrossing and well worth watching, don't look it up on wikipedia if you care about truthfulness. It will drive you nuts.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Cumberbatch proves what it means to be human,"Can machines think?""Carrots mussn touch peas. Carrots mussn touch peas. Carrots mussn touch peas."" There is a scene in the film where young Turing gets bullied. For those of you don't know the entire biography, Turing WAS machine like. He took everything literally, couldn't get jokes as pointed out in the biopic, and even worked like an automaton.Well if the entire premise of the movie is based on that thesis if machines can think, then Cumberbatch surely portrays what it means to be human. He blurs the line between acting and the real Turing in a virtuoso sfumatto which only a Sherlockian protagonist can pull out.That is the real imitation game.I mean heck if homosexual is a stigma, he makes being gay sexy.A svengali voice draws you in, in the theater, with Cumberbatch exuding a brilliant genius with gossamer narcissism not to mention deeply tortured and troubled as well forcing you to pay attention.This is perhaps the best opening monologue I have seen till Godfather and The Dark Knight.He breaks the fourth wall. And in process of doing so had a literally breakdown at the end of the film.But credit must be given to the sheer genius of the ensemble cast as well as well as a nod the young Turing brilliantly portrayed by Alex Lawther.Oscar worthy or not is a moot point.

Historically flawed and grossly unfair.,"I believe that other users have covered the many faults of this film. The only point I want to make is that if the writers wished to create a period drama set in and after WWII, they did not need to trivialise the immense contribution of one of the true geniuses for the 20th Century. Just choose an imaginary character and concentrate on his sexuality, if that's what you want to do. There is no reason to pretend that the most interesting aspect of Turing's life was that he was gay!

Best Picture of the Year,"Saw this movie last Saturday (12/27) and really enjoyed it. I really appreciated the cuts between Touring as an adult and a young man in school. Benedict Cumberbatch's performance is certainly Oscar-worthy. Lots of communication with facial gestures and silence. Mark Strong is excellent as the liaison with the other ""other service."" Very emotionally for me when a young Touring learns that his school chum Christopher is dead. I could not contain my tears of sadness and longing that Alan misses the only love he ever experienced.Keira Knightly as the ""love interest"" is also very good. She nailed the values and limitations of the 50s in Britain. Her performance is quite understated.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Good but not great.,"I saw this last Saturday and enjoyed it but I found Benedict cumberpatch's extreme emotional disconnect so extreme that it gave the entire film a flat and dull edge. The portrayal of the period was excellent and the casting was good (with a special nod to Mark Strong) but the principal performance is so tight that it seems to drain all the life from the piece. Now I realise that a certain echelon of society in these days prized the stiff upper lip but mr cumberpatch plays the buttoned down mathematical genius so devoid of anything approaching emotion that the interest drains from chunks of the film like water down a plughole. Unfortunately it's a style of performance that he is beginning to produce time and again and I begin to wonder whether he actually has much range. Three quarters of the way through I began thinking about the performance produced by 'I, Claudius' star, Derek Jacobi and wishing it was him I was watching. In the end I found this film enjoyable but dissatisfying. And as a nod to the real man, incredibly tragic.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Good True Story but.......................... part spoiler,"This was a great true story but the film has numerous irritations where they dumb down and patronize the audience. Why do film makers so often assume audience are too stupid to notice things that make no sense ? E.g. Our intrepid code breakers can just ring someone and quickly divert a convoy with 30 minutes to spare on their first successful decoded message. Sitting in a tea room discussing how important it is that the enemy has no idea codes have been broken. To emphasize this to the stupid audience, they have wounded soldiers being unloaded outside the window. No explanation where they came from? or why hurt! The acting is generally good. It is a great true story and I would have suggested they could have made a better film by being more historically accurate. Instead they have dumbed it down which spoiled much of the film for me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Bland, ineffective, an offense to it's story","A tragic true story told as generic, mundane and formulaic as possible. Alan Turing is known as a hero to some, yet here he is portrayed like a robot wearing a Benedict Cumberbatch costume that can shed tears when the screenplay allows for it. A screenplay that follows an out-dated guide on how to make an Academy Award winning film.For such an amazing story filled with inspiration and sadness, the filmmakers didn't bother to make any other aspect of the film daring, inventive or even slightly original. Almost every part of this production could have passed as a movie-of-the-week on some major television network. Even the soundtrack is bland, it's as black and white as the over-used stock war footage.A film portraying a story like this, especially it being a true story, should rip the heart out of it's audience, having them leaving the theater disgusted, heart-broken and angry. Instead, what we get here, is a film that rushes through everything, while watering it down, all to fit a family-friendly rating and a run-time of no longer than 2 hours. This leaves the film absolutely ineffective and it's audience indifferent. And that's the worse possible out-come of a film telling such an important, meaningful and provocative true story.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Should be the Oscar winner for best film of 2014,"I was like most of the people in the world; not really knowing anything about Alan Turing. I had heard the name in history classes from high school into college associated with the word Enigma. I knew, from history class, that Enigma was the code machine the Nazis used in WWII to thwart the Allies and keep their attacks a secret. I knew it had been broken but knew little about the man and the team that broke it. This film was like a fabulous history lesson...only I was there living it. If I didn't have any reason to like Benedict Cumberbatch before I have a reason to love him now. If he isn't nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for his role as Turing then I have no faith that the Academy will ever get anything right again. His performance brought me laughter, made me think and, ultimately brought me to tears. The whole world owes this tortured genius a debt of gratitude that we can never repay.

a story that needed to be told,"I had read about this film and became more curious about the story. It is told so well with flashbacks to the main characters time in school, to the 1950's, and back again to the main story. These five people broke the code used by Hilter and as reported, probably ended the war 2 yrs. earlier than if the code was not broken. This is a story of the breaking of the code and more importantly the story of Alan Turing - a very interesting and brilliant man who struggled with who he was. The performance by Benedict Cumberbatch is so good - no wonder there is Oscar talk. You see the internal struggle and learn so much more about him. Kiera Knightly is excellent as the only woman in this group - in a time when women were only allowed to be secretaries. All of the characters are well portrayed. In a year of many films made on true life people this one stands out. I hope the past history of the Academy - to not honor biographical movies - changes this next award ceremony. I will be thinking of this movie for a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"A good tale with a fine lead performance, even if it doesn't delve into details, or worry too much about historical accuracy","I watched another film about the Enigma code recently, and it reminded me that I had not yet seen this one. It is a story I was broadly aware of – not to the point of having read the book, but certainly knowing the general sweep of the events. In a way this does suit the film, because it does brush across the main events in the life of Turning, rather than really delve too deeply into specifics. So we get key childhood moments, the stresses and moral conundrums of breaking the code, and of course his horrific treatment and death due to his sexuality.With this approach the film is actually very well structured as it mixes the global and the personal, as well as combining several running time periods (in a nicely edited construction). As such it is a solid and engaging story, which manages to fold together the central impact made by Turning, the roots of some of his character, and the sad treatment of him at the (early) end of his life. Of course as with any biopic, the film runs a lot together, simplifies wherever it can, and I guess probably will bother those that know the source material / real story inside out (as these things always do). For me I am always happy for such sacrifices being done in the name of a good story, just so long as the film does a good job of telling that story (it is not a documentary, and there are plenty of sources for that). In the case of this film, I think it works, because it is well told and engaging.The lead performance from Cumberbatch is the hook that a lot of it hangs on. He is convincing in his awkward difficultness but yet genius. He is perhaps not particularly well supported by Knightley, although to be fair this is not just down to her but perhaps more to do with how generic her character is. Outside of these two, the supporting turns are solid from those such as Kinnear, Strong, Dance, Goode, Leech, and others. Production values are high throughout, and the direction manages to get a lot of tension out of people in a room thinking – which is pretty hard to deliver as a cinematic experience.All told, it is a handsomely crafted film, with a fine lead performance, and a story that, although probably greatly simplified, is well told and engaging.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Superficial and lazy,"This was fairly bad. If you choose to make a film which focuses on one character, it should really be an in-depth and detailed character study but unfortunately, I found this to be a very superficial 'made for Oscars' type film.I didn't learn anything about the Turing machine itself, for example; the engineering aspects, the design, literally no information whatsoever about how it worked was given and this was something I was really interested in. There was only one aspect of Turing's childhood included and nothing more about his life at home or university. We don't see any of his (then) illegal 'interactions' and the historical detail was fairly sparse.In terms of detail, it felt like the script was written after a brief consultation of Wikipedia.I'm a huge fan of Benedict Cumberbatch, I really am but he's not a strong actor and never has been. He's fantastic in Sherlock and Star Trek but I don't think he plays 'real' people very well. In fact, Turing, as depicted here, seems to have the exact same sense of humour as Sherlock...Keira Knightley was the biggest surprise here, she genuinely transformed herself into a completely different person yet I doubt she'll get the same recognition that Cumberbatch will. She once mentioned as her character in London Boulevard (2010), that women are often written into films purely so that the male lead actor has someone to discuss all of his problems with - for the audience to hear. That's something I now pay attention to in most films I watch and this one is no different. I think we see one scene related to her own personal life (at home with her parents) and then it's swiftly back to Cumberbatch.There's a lot of posturing, posh accents and generally interesting subject matter but unfortunately, I learned nothing about Alan Turing, nothing about the workings of the machine, and in terms of entertainment value, I would probably have got more enjoyment from reading about Turing on Wikipedia.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
One of the Best movies of ALL TIME !!!,"I do not know what to say about this movie. It is surely one of the BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME!!!!!!! Perfect in terms of script and directing.

The Imitation Game includes interesting messages regarding homosexuality and the fact that it can indeed be wonderful, inspiring and even be the cause to solve all enigmas.

A Bite from the Poisoned Apple,"This year's choice of Oscar nominated movies left me pretty unwilling to go to the movie theater. Reading the reviews on IMDb turned me even more off and some movies I may consider seeing are still not in the theaters where I live. But I felt like going to the movies again so I decided to give the Imitation Game a try, mainly because I grew up in an environment of scientists. My father was about the age of the mathematicians in this movie and he worked during and after WWII in an institute of research in Europe for the defense department. Everything the physicists, engineers and mathematicians did was top secret and only many years later did I learn what they were working on, so the movie was familiar to me in many ways.. Movie scripts which are based on true stories and then decide to change the facts in order to appeal to their more simple minded viewers, have never been my favorites. I could not get myself to go and see the movie the Theory of Everything about Stephen Hawking because I read that it is mainly a relationship story and I was more interested in his work. And I am a woman and not a scientist. I felt a little bit the same in this movie because too much emphasis was put on the fact that Turing was gay. Of course I thought it was very important to point out that at that time in history homosexuals were prosecuted no matter where they lived. So there is no need to feel superior there over the Nazis.Afterwards I read that the only female mathematician in the film was wrongly represented because she was obviously already working as a mathematician at Bletchley Park before Turing even got there, which was quite rare at that time and should not have been muddied by acting like she was just some girl doing cross words..I sometimes watch the TV series the Big Bang Theory and am amused about their portrayal of scientists. Well, that is supposed to be a comedy and while they got some traits of scientists right, they are over exaggerating like crazy by portraying them all as bumbling idiots when it comes to social graces. In the many years I have known scientists in the circle of friends of my parents, I have met no bumbling idiots. Most of them were extremely sophisticated and well informed people, who were able to hold their own in any social setting. I just cannot imagine any of them having temper tantrums like was shown in the Imitation Game . It looked to me like a continuation of the school years,which i also found exaggerated and I would have been happy without the whole school segment. I cannot remember any bullying at school when I grew up , it looks to me that this is a more modern thingI also cannot imagine that a bunch of scientists can make any military decisions like it was implied in this movie. When they showed the scene where supposedly the brother of one of the scientists was on a convoy which was going to be bombed in twenty minutes, and they were debating if they should save his life, they lost me. They also lost me when they never showed any male love interest of Turing. If there was so much emphasis put on the fact that he was a homosexual why not show him having a homosexual affair? I can understand that homosexuals at that time would enter pretend marriages, but after what I read now about Turing he had homosexual affairs quite openly.. As I learned after watching the movie it was also not true that they were the only ones to break the code. Iam getting so tired of this endless portrayal of the Germans as Uebermenschen, though of course it was amazing how such a small country could win so many battles in WWII. Compare that to the huge military force of the US losing one war after the other, it is quite impressive.I am not saying that it was a bad film, but I did not find it so spellbinding and fascinating as many other reviewers did. I would have preferred if they would have concentrated more on the process of finding the solution and the excitement of making new discoveries in science. We need more scientists and I do not think that portraying them as social outcasts helps.The most fascinating thing I read browsing through the other reviews was that Steve Job used the bitten apple symbol because of the cyanide laced apple Turing used for suicide. If that is true, that would be quite something.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Left me angry... at the fate of Alan Turing,"I know quite a bit about Alan Turing and have felt his treatment after the war was a crying disgrace but this movie serves to humanize him and it makes me even more resentful of his treatment. The film does not idolize Turing, or even paint a particularly pretty picture of his nature, none the less it does present a portrait of a complicated and very intelligent man who's contributions to the world are profound. Like Edison v Tesla, we idolize Einstein yet few have even heard of Alan Turing though his impact on our world with the invention of the programmable computer and his leadership in cracking the German enigma code leading to the defeat of the Nazi regime is probably as great any modern scientist. This is a fascinating high quality film that tells a story that needs to be told.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"A good film - a crowd-pleaser, but could have been a great film.","In the last couple of weeks, I have seen 2 biographical films. Yesterday, The Imitation Game and and previously Mr Turner. I rated Turner as a 9 out of 10 because it was, as a film, a masterpiece. It was not though a ""crowd pleaser"" i.e. full of romance, humour etc. Imitation Games by contrast is a ""crowd pleaser"" - and more on the humour in a moment. It is not a masterpiece partly because of this but mainly because it singularly failed to convey the atmosphere of those times without descending into farce. You only had to listen to the constant laughter in the cinema to realise that the director's attempts to make a dumbed-down crowd-pleaser had worked, but to the great detriment of the film. I guess he was concerned that cryptography would be dull, whereas in fact the way he explained all of that was very good and the farce elements were thus unnecessary. I have to admit that I have studied the Enigma machine and been to Bletchley as well as studying the history and current uses of cryptography so I come at this with a fair knowledge of what the film was about and of Turing himself. The story itself was reasonably accurately told and the audience have not been misled.Turing's team were sadly misrepresented by abysmal miscasting. To use Allen Leech from Downton Abbey was a bizarre decision particularly (crown-pleasing again perhaps) because he acted and spoke exactly the same is he does in that popular TV show which causes great confusion - why is Tom in this film you brain asks you! Matthew Goode was also totally out of place in every respect. In absolute contrast, that fine actor Rory Kinnear was totally believable as the detective - if he can use a Manchester accent, why cannot Leech use a different accent? Inexcuseable.But, in contrast to these failings, Cumberbatch made the part his own. Extrordinary acting of the highest calibre. There was no confusion between Turing and Sherlock. Without Cumberbatch, this film would sink but with him, it becomes a very good film indeed despite it's other problems. Other actors that turned-in fine performances included Charles Dance and surprisingly Keira Knightley.Oscar Faura's normally excellent photography was something of a disappointment - nothing wrong with it, but lacking in any sort of commitment (a real contrast to Dick Pope's in Turner). There was quite a bit of CGI used to represent scenes of devastation caused by bombing, and these were simple dreadful, lacking any realism at all - presumably they ran out of budget. Using digital instead of film might have helped here! Faura should see Pope's work on Turner to see how much better digital can be and at much less cost.Now, I said I would come on to humour. We used to laugh at stammering, at people with deformities, at people of short stature. They were set-up by directors for laughs. Thank goodness, we have all moved on from that. I say all, because Morten Tyldum has clearly not done so and believes that making laughs from people's conditions is just fine. Alan Turing's tendency to be severely logical - beyond the point of social survival - may in the end be what killed him. This can appear as a symptom of Asperger's Syndrome - a form of autism claimed to be associated with mathematicians and computer scientists. Henry O'Connell and Michael Fitzgerald suggest this might be the diagnosis warranted for Turing, in a paper published in the 'Irish Journal of Psychological Medicine'. So, Tyldum thinks it is fine to mock and encourage his audience to laugh at someone who had a condition - one that probably caused him to take his own life.Unfortunately Tyldum's lack of thought and lack of sensitivity runs right through this film from the casting, the cinematography, the dreadful CGI and ultimately the cheap crowd-pleasing. A shame that Cumberbatch could not have influenced Tyldum but clearly he did not not.All this aside, it's a good film to see - especially if you are one of the diminishing number who don't know about Turing already. If you see Cumberbatch you will have seen Turing. I hope you understand him, value his genius and that you don't laugh at him.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Brits were not the first ones to break Enigma,"I have just one comment. Why is a movie founded on a lie such a huge success and even nominated for an Oscar? Alan Turing was not the first guy to crack the code. He and others at Bletchley Park were merely the smart folks who used Polish groundbreaking cryptography methods to tackle Enigma. Turing is portrayed here as a hero and the success as solely his, all according to the sneaky writers of The Imitation Game. Did they forget to carry out a proper research or was their mission to undermine Polish part a deliberate thing? Brits often forget about their 2WW allies, ascribing all the war effort success to themselves. But hey, even 'bletchleyparkorg', the official website, says ""The Poles broke Enigma in 1932""...In 1939 with the invasion on Poland imminent the Poles reached out to Britons for help and thus Bletchley Park became the centre where cryptographers were unscrambling the code.

The Imitation Game is a lesson in back-of-the-line warfare,"First, I'd have to say this is probably the only picture I've seen recently that was more than worth the price of admission. Second, there were two aspects of it that demand positive comment and one final one that though negative and not so important, is best mentioned briefly.The first impressive thing about this movie is its beautiful construction and execution. Just as an exercise in movie-making it's a wonderful example of people with skill taking their craft seriously. The second impressive thing was the acting by Benedict Cumberbatch which if contrasted with his Sherlock Holmes on TV and his turn as Kahn in the last Star Trek movie is absolutely an unparalleled achievement in his art. What really got me was that several times I looked in his eyes on screen and could have sworn I must be seeing the real Alan Turing. This guy is the closest thing to a shoo in for the Oscar as any I've ever seen.One quibble, which I do not advocate anyone let keep them from this beautiful movie is, I'm pretty sure they've played fast and loose with the true story. But there's no denying they've done it for a good cause.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Epic WWII storytelling done right!,"This is a splendidly executed re-creation of the epic events that eventually led to Britain's almost continuous cracking of the top-secret daily machine settings of Germany's ""Enigma"" code throughout most of WWII, so that they could read and act upon the Wehrmacht's encrypted military messages. Determining those daily settings demanded the manipulation of massive amounts of mathematical data... an overwhelming task for the teams of mathematicians and cryptanalysts at the government's top-secret cypher center at Bletchley Park, north of London. The British had obtained a working copy of the German 'Enigma' machine... but it was a useless boat anchor without knowing the Germans' top-secret daily machine settings.The protagonist is Cambridge mathematician Alan Turing (brilliantly portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch), who quickly determined that a computing device must be created to deal with the massive amounts of data that had to be manipulated daily to determine that day's machine settings. The film correctly focuses upon Turing's personal contributions to create the electromechanical computing machine (the ""Bombe"") that accomplished that task, how it helped to both win and significantly shorten the war, and on the unfortunate events that led eventually to his code breaking and life-saving achievements being disregarded by the British government.IMHO, the film should've perhaps devoted more time to depict some of the fascinating wartime secrets revealed in advance by Turing's machine: such breathtaking top secrets as the locations throughout the Atlantic of Germany's U-boat wolfpacks, the German Wehrmacht's surprise invasion of The Soviet Union (22 June, 1941)... even the radio traffic of Luftwaffe fighters as they approached and shot down (actor/secret British envoy) Leslie Howard's aircraft on 1 June, 1943. It's a MUST-SEE flick--and one that you must follow attentively: missing a single line of dialogue can lead to your missing out on an important plot nuance or a gem of tongue-in-cheek humour.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Perfection,"""The Imitation Game"" may turn out to be the year's most pleasant surprise. It works both as a gripping wartime thriller, (and something seeming rather out of time from what we're used to seeing in our multiplexes in 2014), and as a fascinating biography of Alan Turing, the mathematical genius behind the breaking of the Enigma code. He's played magnificently by Benedict Cumberbatch and this is the film that is going to make him a major movie star. Cumberbatch has already established his pedigree on television, (winning this year's Emmy for ""Sherlock""), and in the theatre, (an Olivier for playing both the doctor and the monster in the National Theatre's ""Frankenstein""). Now he will almost certainly add an Oscar nomination, if not the award itself, to his tally of prizes and he is backed by a superb ensemble.As the only woman on Turing's team Keira Knightley is outstanding and there is very good work from Mark Strong, Charles Dance, Rory Kinnear, Allen Leech, Matthew Goode, Matthew Beard and Alex Lawther, superb as the young Turing. The director, perhaps surprisingly given the material, is the Norwegian Morten Tyldum, (he of ""Headhunters"" fame), and he does an exceptional job, both in building suspense and establishing atmosphere. The first-rate script, adapted from Andrew Hodges' book ""Alan Turing; The Enigma"", is by Graham Moore, (another probable Oscar nomination). Indeed, I can't really find fault with ""The Imitation Game"", (photography, production design, music etc. are all perfect). Kudos to everyone involved.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
History for the lazy,"Outdated, erroneous, inauthentic, unrealistic narratives that attempt to force the simplified telling of the fallacy of 'the chosen one', 'the one who ruled them all'.
Every area of history for no other reason than we still prefer our stories nice and linear, with clear heroes and villains.
History told for the masses does great damage, as many will view this as fact.
The truth is behind all the worlds great epochs, inventions, innovations, breakthroughs and so forth are almost exclusively the work of a group of people.

"Covered with a thin layer of gloss, but consistently thrilling and engaging","Benedict Cumberbatch seems to be making a career out of playing troubled and flawed genius's, following his huge success as Sherlock Holmes in the TV series Sherlock and the upcoming - and hugely exciting - Dr. Strange in Marvel's upcoming film based on the sorcerer supreme. His finest work so far is in The Imitation Game as code-breaker Alan Turing, the unsung war hero who helped crack the apparently unbreakable Enigma machine used by the Germans during World War II, helping to save millions of lives in the process and shaving years off the war.Turing was recognised as a prodigy from an extremely young age, and his cerebral superiority isolated him from others. He travels to Beltchley Park, where Commander Denniston (Charles Dance) interviews him as part of a recruitment process to form a cryptology team headed by chess champion Hugh Alexander (Matthew Goode), tasked to break the Enigma code. Turing gets the job through sheer intellectual brilliance, but not through his condescending personality, which instantly puts him at odds with the rigid and impatient Denniston. When he joins the team, which also consists of John Cairncross (Allen Leech) and Peter Hilton (Matthew Beard), he wastes no time in voicing his desire to work alone and dismisses the input of the others as simple time-wasting.Director Morten Tyldum and writer Graham Moore have not created a work of any great intelligence or subtlety here, and The Imitation Game plays very much by the standard biopic rule book. No great care goes into helping us understand the inner workings of the Enigma itself, or the work done by Turing and his fellow code-breakers, and the film very much relies on great acting and a fast pace. The scenes with Turing, Alexander et al hard at work has them with sleeves rolled-up and chewing pencils whilst staring at boards. We don't quite know what they're doing, but we are certainly urging them to achieve their goal, and, of course, this being a film about Turing, there's only so much of his work that can be squeezed into two hours.The Imitation Game also helps make the story relevant to the modern day. At the beginning of the film, set after the war, Turing is burgled and his flippant dismissal of the investigating Detective Nock (Rory Kinnear) puts him under suspicion. He is arrested for participating in lurid acts with a man, a crime punishable by up to two years in prison back then. It all ties in nicely with the recent official apology from Gordon Brown, then-prime minister in 2009, and his official pardon by the Queen in 2014. Flashbacks of Turing's early childhood at a boarding school and his relationship with close friend Christopher Morcom (Jack Bannon) are peppered throughout. They help gain an understanding of Turing's love of cryptology and his emerging sexuality, and these scenes are finely played by the young Alex Lawther and do in no way hinder the flow of the film.But the film's trump card is undoubtedly Cumberbatch. Although his delivery at times can border on stage-y, he has a great weight to his voice. His face exudes such intelligence and charisma that you just want to pick it apart to see what's under there. Keira Knightley too, who I haven't even mentioned yet, is a surprise revelation as Joan Clarke, a fellow prodigy puzzle-solver who, being a woman, had to be hidden away as regulations didn't permit women positions of worthy status. She is fierce and full of life, the polar opposite to the withdrawn and work-focused Turing. Yet the two develop an intriguing and entirely convincing platonic love affair, leading to their short-lived engagement in 1941. It's covered with a thin layer of gloss and a longer running time with more careful story development would have been beneficial, but The Imitation Game is consistently thrilling and engaging, bolstered by a great ensemble.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A Gay Man Saves 14 Million Lives Throughout the World,"....by shortening humanity's worst war of all time by at least two years! He may even have saved the life of my own beloved grandfather who worked in the Brooklyn (New York) Navel Yard all throughout World War 2! A military target that would have eventually been within reach of German submarines.If it wasn't for Alan Turing's genius, integrity and perseverance all of history would have been changed for the worse. Another minor footnote: He's also the father of the modern computer and one of the greatest mathematicians who ever lived.Despite being one of the giants of the 20th century, few people outside those with a passion for history or computing have ever heard of the man until now. No universities or streets are named after him. No statues or portrait honor Turing anywhere in the world all because he is gay. In fact, it took the Queen of England to the year 2013 to issue him a pardon for having consensual sex - in the privacy of his home - with another man! In 2013! That's an abomination. The Queen of England is sitting on her throne in one piece because of this man! She should have laid a wreath on his grave decades ago!I'm not ashamed to admit it, but I sobbed at the end of this movie! This is a most profound story about love! YES! LOVE! Intense, passionate love is not limited to just heterosexuals!It's also a story about sex. I was born in the 1960's and consensual sex - in the privacy of one's home - between men was legal in the State I was living in when I turned 18. But the stigma of being a sexual minority remains in way too many places – and affects me greatly in my own personal life to this very day. The pain I – and others – have suffered for being ""different"" is indescribable. This story validates my experiences and the experiences of millions of other sexual minorities – from around the world - both living and deceased.The cruelty Alan Turing experienced from his classmate is similar to what I had to endure in high school. But I was lucky; I never had to worry about having consensual sex with another man in the privacy of my own home. But in Alan Turing's case you get to see a good man who gave so incredibly much to the world be ripped apart by pure evil that was 100% legal back in the 1950's! It's so ironic too! Watch closely. The police officer breaks the law and he is the one who should be legitimately imprisoned! It's not just in the United States that police officers feel they are above the law they supposedly serve!Memo to Hollywood: This shows you know how to make great movies. Sure, you won't make billions every time, but you're gonna make a tidy profit by doing a spectacular job. Wouldn't you rather make a film people will be watching 500 years from now on another planet in another solar system then making trash, like The Hobbit trilogy, that no will care about once it leaves the theaters?One more point to ponder: Michelangelo is considered by most people to be the greatest sculptor who ever lived. He was a gay man and he lived five centuries ago - in peace - till he died at 88 (Yes 8-8). Now fast-forward to the 1950's - in what was supposedly the country that birthed modern democracy - and look what the British did to one of the greatest mathematicians that ever lived only because he is gay!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Good historical drama,"Good historical drama.The story of Alan Turing, the man who, in World War II, lead the team that cracked Germany's Enigma Code. His efforts went a long way to winning the war. The machine he developed to crack Engima was revolutionary, resulting in him being regarded as the father of computing.However, it's not all about this feat. Turing was homosexual and we see how this affects his life, especially post-WW2.Overall, a decent examination of the impact of this gifted man on society, with sub-plot on intolerance and injustice.Good performance by Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead role and by Keira Knightley. Both received Oscar nominations. Good support from Mark Strong, Charles Dance and Matthew Goode.Not a perfect movie though. Many of the details feel over- simplified and Hollywoodized. The military side, especially, is very simplistically told. This leaves the movie feeling a bit superficial and a bit too neat. Plus, for something that is one of the main plot points, his personal life seems to only get a passing mention, and only really comes to the fore towards the end.A longer movie, with a more detailed study of the man, was in order, I think.This said, what we have is very good, and surely enough to spark the curiosity of anyone with even a mild interest in history.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Based on a real story: The man's name was Alan Turing ...,"and he worked on breaking Enigma at Bletchley. There the reality ends ... apart from the great emphasis on his sexual orientation.As I am sure many people familiar with actual history have mentioned, the Enigma was broken in the early '30-s at the Polish Cipher Bureau. Turing's work concerned extending that to the enhanced Enigma introduced at the start of the war. Without the work of the Poles (which they handed over on the brink of the German invasion) the Bletchely crew was unlikely to have been able to make headway, and certainly not in time for it to be useful.In any case, Turing's most important work (compared to which Bletchley pales) is his seminal work on computability theory. His paper, together with those of Kurt Gödel produced an earthquake-like shift in understanding the foundations of mathematics and what could or could not be proved or solved.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The Imitation Game: Who Ever Loved Ordinary?,"The Imitation Game is a striking film, a masterfully made film, and a film that was cowardly in its promotion.We need films about the horrific way gay individuals, especially men, were treated in times not all that long ago. We need these films more than another burly combat film, or another edge-of-your- seat action flick, or another battle focused tall tale. I am confused by critics who say this film did not portray Turing's homosexuality enough, it is prevalent, the more steadfast theme than any other. I am left to assume many have only watched the trailers and not the entire film.This movie, represented as a war/spy/thriller type foray, is a film primarily about a genius of a man, comprised of so much more than what he was attracted to, who's life is mangled bit by bit, and finally ended, by his homosexuality. It could be seen as dancing around this point for the first third (though not a light dance, more a loud and aggressively obvious lindy hop) and then showcases it. I respect the film for its open exploration in the life of an individual who was torn down by disgusting bigotry and fear others had for those out of the ""norm"", and while I cannot help but feel the film ranked Turing's sexuality above his genius, an occasionally irksome decision, it is an understandable path on a social level, and one I deem necessary.The acting is superb, Cumberbatch is occasionally accused of playing the same role over and over and I have seen such said in relation to this film, but Alan is not a role. He was a living, breathing, fascinating individual that Cumberbatch captures with as much subtle but spot on accuracy as he could muster. Every actor in this film was well chosen, there is an easy chemistry between all involved, a refreshing change from many films.You do not have any excess of love for any of the individuals represented, Turing included, but they are profoundly human in their sufferings and their victories. This film is not one dimensional and it does not bow down to the humans that inspired it, nor does it need to. There are even surprising, if somewhat brief, moments of humour throughout, saving it from becoming droll, preachy, or alienating.There's always the big question: Does this movie have, as so many are calling it, an ""agenda""?Yes, it does. This isn't the film many people were hoping it would be, it is not action packed, it is rarely tense, but it is deeply affecting. I know without a doubt that a good percentage of individuals that went to see this film were hoping for something polar opposite from what they got, but I like to think that those individuals had their eyes opened to something arguably, at this point, more important than another film about ""taking d0wn HitLer!!11/1!"" or battlefield glory. This film is not about the war, it is about the man that strayed outside of any socially acceptable life and changed the world. It is undeniable that the focus on him could be considered cloying, but it can be forgiven in the overall picture.I recommend this movie wholeheartedly, be you a mere fan of Cumberbatch, a Turing aficionado, or just looking for a film to immerse yourself in when you have little else to do. It is not perfect, I will make no claim to that, but it grabs you. It is not overwhelmingly sad nor is it falsely happy, it is human, it will make you think, it will open your mind to a variety of things, and maybe, just maybe, in one way or another, it can help better you. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"""i don't like sandwiches""","First off, let me address the elephant in the room, for the people who scored this movie based on its absolute historical accuracy.shame on you.Yes, there is some artistic license involved, but if movies are scored on how closely they followed a story, and/or historical event, well, The last Hobbit movie would get 2/10, and ""Where Eagles Dare"", would get 0/10. You're here to remark on, and review the movie, not score it for accuracy.This is a story based around Alan Turing, who headed up the team during the war, to decode the German enigma machine. It follows the story ""loosely"", and has some events changed, to make the story fit into the time frame, and to change the pace of the story for the silver screen.The palette of emotions delivered by the actors involved, is nothing short of stunning, Cumberbatch as the quirky, almost autistic genius is fantastic, and manages to portray a character with a complete lack of social skills, that strangely enough, is extremely easy to warm to, and to empathise with, The other cast members, namely Keira Knightley, Mark Strong, and Charles dance carry off some great performances with a wonderful stoicism and British ""stiff upper lip"", that makes their sometimes cold characters, absolutely compelling to watch. The script is marvelous, and hand in hand with some great editing, the movie hits the ground running, with a frenetic pace, that's akin to a big budget action movie. The soundtrack and locations are also well above par, and just adds to the other great components, to make a great story.Cumberbatch steals the show, with the script/movie twisting around his genius, and his moral dilemmas, and social attitudes of the time, which woven into the story by some of the UK's best talent, means that you really cant take your eyes of the screen.Do yourself a favour, and go see this, its one of the rare gems in cinema nowadays, a story that is gripping, compelling, emotional, and doesn't rely on eye candy and CGI to blow your mind.If this doesn't win an academy award, then there really is no justice.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
An historical film with contemporary resonances,"What makes this such an exceptional film is the combination of a compelling narrative with an outstanding central performance. It is the true story of how the brilliant but eccentric British mathematics genius Alan Turing led a small, but exceptionally talented. team that managed to break the Germans' Enigma code which shortened the Second World War by years. Benedict Cumberbatch gives a wonderfully nuanced display as the reclusive and tortured scientist. A very creditable showing by Keira Kinighley should be acknowledged and Charles Dance and Mark Strong are always spot on.Norwegian director Morten Tyldum and American writer Graham Moore eschew straight-line plotting, deploying three alternating time-lines: Turing's time as a desperately lonely child at boarding school, his wartime service in Hut 8 at the top secret Bletchley Park decoding centre, and his post-war arrest for an act of ""gross indecency"" with another man. It seems amazing now that the British state could have convicted, and arguably sent to his death, someone who made such a phenomenal contribution to the defeat of Hitler.This is a film which, important though it is for reviving the reputation of an unlikely war hero who for so long was forgotten or maligned, speaks to us today, both because of our (fortunately) very different attitude to homosexuality now and of contemporary developments in computing and artificial intelligence/",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Turing was a genius, a difficult one (is there any who smiles and is nice?; maybe no interest in a biopic about them) who gets into the supermegasecret team (some action movie shortcomings here, with music and people running from one place to the other just to make the viewer feel all these characters always had traditional random comment-light-bulb-running back to the office moment) to crack the Nazi German Enigma code. The movie does a nice (albeit traditional) job of presenting the characters and their struggle against the code, while offering two more moments of Turing's life (back in school, when he was bullied and after the war, when it was discovered he was a homosexual). It is all very neatly done, nice interpretation and pace, etc etc.So why follow on all the steps of so many biopics from the past, as Turing was obviously a person who hadn't a conventional life?You won't regret watching the movie.

To Turing,"The most distinguishing thing is when everybody works hard on how to solve the exact code, Turing works on how to find a method to build a machine to solve all the codes forever.

It's about evaluating the algorithm and evaluating all the algorithms that can solve the problem, which is the science of analyzing the complexity of algorithms. It's a huge breakthrough on ideas, thoughts, and minds, rather than methods.It's a little pity that there is no apple at the end of the movie, which is quite an symbol of him and Apple Inc., and the whole IT industry.

The movie has three parallels: pre world war II, world war II and post the same. The scientist's role in, and his discovery during the world war is the main plot, pre world war scenes certainly adds beauty to it whereas post world war story feels rather intrusive. Even the world war footages, most of them come across a little difficult to blend with the main story and you know it is to fill time and for the feel of world war II, well probably because the fine performance by Benedict Cumberbatch makes you feel disturbed by everything else. What a fine performance by Benedict, the actor knows his character and plays it well throughout the movie. He smiles/angers/cries/walks/runs the way his character should. So yeah everything is good. Keira looked pretty with some flesh on her cheeks which she always needed. A good movie, go and watch!But there is one more thing which makes it a more than just a movie, it's a story of a great scientist, a mathematician and how he falls towards the end of his life. The singularity of his passion and his euphoria towards his work which holds true for any scientist, these movies always get to me. The last 20 minutes of the movie fill you with this immense sorrow you feel for Late Mr Alan Turing, his great mind and work, and for what he got in return. It all becomes just too sad. So yeah watch it :)",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Great Movie,"I saw this movie early in 2015 and if I see a better movie this year, I will be very surprised as The Imitation Game is brilliant.The movie stars Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead role of Alan Turing. Being from Manchester where Turing spent his later life there is obviously a strong connection. The film is mostly focused on Turing's efforts to break the German Enigma code which was a seemingly unbreakable encryption code developed by Germany in world war 2. The methods that Turing employs in his effort to try and break the code bring him into conflict with many people who prefer more traditional methods.The film is also very much about the relationship Turing has with Joan Clarke(Knightly) who he takes a shine too.Cumberbatch is brilliant in the leading role and even though he will lose out (wrongly!)on the major acting awards this year, it cannot be long before he gets rewarded.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Tries to cover too much,"The Imitation Game tells the true story of Alan Turig, a World War II British mathematician who develops a monstrous machine (now known as the computer) that ultimately helps defeat Germany. Benedict Cumberbatch is outstanding in his portrayal of Turing, whose life story has two major facets: the development of the machine and later in his life being charged for the crime of being gay. The fault in The Imitation Game is director Morten Tyldum's attempts to tell both stories. Ultimately, the story of Turig's inhumane sentence — forced to undergo painful hormonal treatment to reverse his libido — was seemingly crammed into the movie, not giving it enough justice. His story would've been better served as a 90-minute movie, focusing on the machine, or a 3-hour epic, covering his life.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Cumberbatch's greatest,"Quickie Review:In the midst of WWII Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch), a brilliant British mathematician, along with his colleagues attempt to break the Enigma code. As Turing tries to uncover Nazi secrets, he must keep his own secrets hidden in a world that does not accept his personal desires. The Imitation Game, is a deeply moving story about the people behind the scenes of a war. The great cast is vastly overshadowed by the performance given by Benedict Cumberbatch, possibly his best so far. This is a beautifully directed, written, scored, and acted film that should not be missed. It is worth all the awards buzz it has been getting.Full Review:Last time I heard of Alan Turing was a brief mention in a documentary about secret historic scientific research, which in this case is the Enigma machine decoder. I know of his contribution to the war effort and science, but as for the man himself I know very little. The fact that The Imitation Game concentrates on the man rather than the machine is what makes it all the more interesting.By far the greatest strength of the movie is Cumberbatch's portrayal of Turing. At this point does it really come as surprise that his acting is good in a movie? No, probably not. But is he exceptional beyond his norm? Most definitely yes. Turing was not exactly a likable person, he had problems communicating, often being mistaken for being rude or insensitive. Cumberbatch captures these mannerisms of Turing perfectly. He gets us to figure out what he is trying to say or mean, much the same way he is figuring out the meaning of the Enigma code. This makes it more engaging for us to watch the conversations of the characters unfold. Of course a well written dialog doesn't hurt in that aspect as well. The rest of the cast were also a great addition, especially Keira Kightley who brought a lot heart to her character. The scenes with her and Cumberbatch were some of the more emotionally impactful scenes in the film.Many would think of the battles fought by soldiers with guns when talking about a WWII movie. Even just recently we had a release called Fury. However, in The Imitation Game it's refreshing to see the contributions made by the people behind desks, back in their homes, working daily to help stop the war early. We get to see the failures, the triumphs, the burden of responsibility they bear, and the moral issues they must confront. It's fair to say that these efforts mostly go unnoticed by the public. So I appreciate that the movie sheds some light on this side of WWII. More importantly, I appreciate that the movie does not shy away from exploring the hardships Turing had to go through to hide his homosexuality. The contrast between how the LGBT are viewed back then compared to now is striking. The way that part of the story was handled really added to one of the most poignant endings to a film in recent memory.Sure I didn't mention the problems of the movie, but ultimately the negatives are not prominent enough to detract you from a beautiful story. I highly recommend this movie to anyone really, because I suspect not many people in the mainstream know of Alan Turing. It's important to see how this one person affected the world.

What Better Way is There to Learn History?,"An entertaining narrative and amazing performances by actors Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley, combined with fleshed out characters and old-fashioned epic styled cinematography, cover up minor moments of typical biopic cheesiness, making this movie highly worthwhile.I must confess that I knew very little about Alan Turing before going into this film. An incredibly fleeting preview look at who he was showed him to be a highly influential figure in the British victory in World War II, and as somebody later in life prosecuted for the then-crime of homosexual acts.Although Turing himself seemed like an interesting man to read about, I was initially slightly hesitant. Biography pictures have never been my cup of tea, and even the presence of talented actors such as Benedict Cumberbatch, Keira Knightly and Mark Strong were not enough to convince me of this film's potential quality.In the end what convinced me to see it was the mix of a good trailer, solid early reviews on the movie's quality, and the fact that the director Morten Tyldum's last movie was the very exciting, and very good, ""Headhunters"", which showed a lot of potential in him as a director.The movie does a lot well straight off the bat. It's a highly entertaining film which moves at a fast pace, as it focuses mainly on Turing and his team of code-breakers as they try to break Enigma, the Nazi military code machine. Along with the main plot the story cuts back to Turing's childhood, when he was an outcast who was picked on at school before a boy named Christopher befriended him and introduced him to the codes which would play such a large role in his life. Also featured is Turing after the war, where police are investigating a break in at his house, which ultimately leads to him being targeted as a potential homosexual. By changing the time-frames that the story is being told in, and slightly messing with chronological order, the story is made infinitely more interesting, and we get to learn far more about the man Alan Turing.Unlike failed biographical films, this movie has characters that feel genuine, and don't just feel like actors saying famous lines that the person was famous for saying. Of course, there are scenes where that does happen, but for the most part it is not a problem. The direction is top-notch throughout this whole work, and Tyldum gives the film the look of an old-school spy thriller, giving each shot an air of importance and, along with the work of the script by Graham Moore (and adapted from the book by Andrew Hodges), keeps what could be a slow and plodding story moving at a brisk pace.Although the movie gets a lot right, it does have some moments that bring it down from a potentially great movie, and keep it at just being very good. For most of the movie, the soundtrack is superb, and atmosphere building, however on some occasions it is overbearing and creates some cheesy moments. In general, melodrama proves to be the film's main problem, with a few cringe-worthy scenes that are quite typically found in the biopic genre. In these scenes, characters act far more earnestly then they most likely would in real life so as to build the tension of dramatic moments. That being said, this dramatic flair is also what makes the movie interesting, so I suppose moments like this are easily forgiven. Another small problem I had with the film is that some historical moments just feel like they were added for the sake of it, almost like they had a check-list of things to cross-off that had to be in the film so as not to bother history buffs. In a movie that already flirts dangerously with what is fact and what is fiction, some of these definitely don't feel necessary.Overall, despite some flaws, the movie works as it is incredibly entertaining with a clever narrative that shows the effect that Alan Turing had on the war. From what I hear the facts are exaggerated, but that feels understandable, and the movie still results in a smartly directed and worthwhile movie that has potential to be a genuine crowd-pleaser, in the old-fashioned meaning of the word.The lame and more cliché moments in the script perhaps keep the movie from being great, and the no-risk approach to maintaining the likability of Turing perhaps is why it just misses out on taking the movie to the next level. That in mind, I would definitely recommend this to anybody looking for a movie to go and see in cinemas. Cumberbatch and Knightley are brilliant, and I will definitely be eager to see Tyldum's next feature film.Score: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Biopic of Alan Turing - ""Father of Artificial Intelligence""","Morton Tyldum directed THE IMITATION GAME - a biopic of The ""Father of Computer Science"" - Alan Turing (1912-1954) in such a way that we are ricocheting back and forth in time beginning in 1926 and ending in 1954 focusing on ""British mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst and pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing who was a key figure in cracking Nazi Germany's naval Enigma code which helped the Allies win the Second World War, only to later be criminally prosecuted for his homosexualitywith a screenplay by Graham Moore based on the biography Alan Turing: The Enigma by Andrew Hodges"" (Wikipedia)We at first do not see Mr. Turing (a wrenching performance by Benedict Cumberbatch)- instead we hear his imperious voice - a tone meting out strictures - like a professor high atop a mountain talking to a kindergarten child, and then we see an awkward, arrogant, and if the film is to be believed young man who seems to fit the Asperger's Syndrome profile - but that late 20th C. diagnosis is debatable. Benedict Cumberbatch with a quivering upper lip, wet steamy eyes, exhibits a fierce confidence in his own ability. He is a loner - a type of loner who does not give a damn about the opinion of others because his opinion of himself is so indomitableand true.THE IMITATION GAME revolves around the depiction of a person who is ""different""- who was both an heroic and a tragic figure. It disturbingly reveals the disdain of those in authority to someone who once was indispensable to the British government's war effort and the ease with which they can be ""discarded"" once they are no longer of useeven if you worked for the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park England - having built a machine that was able to decipher daily Nazi messages which yielded German military intelligence - shortening the war by 2-4 years thereby saving millions of lives. After the war all the work decoding Enigma was wiped out of the official records as if his intense achievements had never happened. History evaporated.Turing talked about ""the imitation game""- how does one know if communication is from a human or a machine so he devised the TURING TEST: ""The Turing test is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. In the original illustrative example, a human judge engages in natural language conversations with a human and a machine designed to generate performance indistinguishable from that of a human being. The conversation is limited to a text-only channel such as a computer keyboard and screen so that the result is not dependent on the machine's ability to render words into audioAll participants are separated from one another. If the judge cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test. The test does not check the ability to give the correct answer to questions; it checks how closely each answer resembles the answer a human would give"" (Wikipedia)The movie's drama revolves around an inventive person and how he negotiates the world outside of the mind. Not only is Alan Turing a brilliant mathematician but he is also gay in a country (Britain) that prosecuted and jailed ""homosexuals"" for ""gross indecency"" (The Sexual Offenses Act of Parliament did not decriminalize sexual activity between two men until 1967,) so keeping secrets became the core of his existence, from an early age when he was the smartest schoolboy in his class and formed a deep friendship with another young man who became his only friend rescuing him from the bullying behavior of fellow classmates; that special relationship becomes a fulcrum for THE IMITATION GAME.Benedict Cumberbatch performance as Alan Turing is heartbreaking giving us insight into a man with rare ingenuity and intelligence, but unpolished and artless in his negotiations with bureaucratic officials who condescendingly impose deadlines and place other restrictions on his inquiry. Keira Knightley plays Joan Clarke, the only female member of the elite circle of mathematicians; a humanizing bridge and ""social"" teacher as well as an intellectual ally of Turing and briefly his fiancé, becoming a critical member of the team and his emotional life. She is broadminded and excited by Turing's fulgent mind - their collaboration is essential to the success of decoding Enigma.Integral contributions to society can be accomplished without reward. Often those responsible for timeless scientific advances created during periods of war/crisis that impact us all to this very day are forgotten - some intentionally so. THE IMITATION GAME tries to resurrect an extraordinary person, Alan Turing - a being who is still considered by many in the tech world to be the founder of ""Artificial Intelligence"" and his machine the forerunner of the world's first personal computer. This film is a tale of a life well-lived but shockingly crippled by the ignorance and narrow-mindedness of bigotry.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A movie to think about...,"""Sometimes it is the people no one imagines of who do the things no one can imagine."" - Christopher Morcom The Imitation Game by Morten Tyldum is a well scripted biopic about the success behind the Second World War with the help of Prof. Alan Turing and his team of the best cryptographers in Britain, portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch, Keira Knightley, Allen Leech, Matthew Goode and many more. The movie in general is about a machine developed by Turing to break Germany's Enigma machine. This machine was later developed by scientists to create the Turing Machines which is now known as computers. The Imitation Game is more than the invention of a machine. It's about acceptance. It questions the degree of acceptance that we as a society have in regard to the uniqueness in each one of us. Alan Turing is known as the father of computer science and he was homosexual. As the movie's creators say, 'It took a man with secrets to break the biggest one.' I believe if I say anything further, there is high chance that I might spoil the story for some of you. In all, it was totally worth the wait (around 1 and a half years for me), and Benedict Cumberbatch being a great actor as he always is, has done an excellent job.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Brilliant and charismatic, Benedict Cumberbatch is a master of his craft.","If there is a role of eccentric genius in near future, it will either land on Benedict Cumberbatch or be inevitably compared to his on The Imitation Game. As homage for a prestigious man, he displays acting caliber of the highest level. He dons the personality and quirks, brings out the best and also most fragile quality of a character. In no overstatement, he introduces a man on-screen and makes audience sympathizes with him as he should be appreciated in life.His role as Alan Turing is as splendid as one could hope be represented with. This probably rivals Russell Crows's performance in A Beautiful Mind. That being said, the rest of cast performs beautifully as well. Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke is wonderful. She's not flashy or extravagance in this role, instead she is deceptively bland, but has a more approachable and kind nature. Her demeanor is calming, also effective in bringing a pinch of innocence on time of war. The charming accent doesn't hurt either.Script are well done, dialogues fit the characters in less complicated way. It helps significantly since the theme is already a complex one, yet the underlying message is resoundingly clear, it need not to be deciphered. Character interaction feels authentic, from the honest troubling confession to the more awkward banter, even though some of these must have been slight exaggerated for cinema. Still, it's a nice way to convey their feelings.Pacing is meticulously done, often the movie strolls between different timelines, and manages to highlight each portion with timely fashion. The transition doesn't feel forced, it moves just the way it should naturally. It cleverly depicts Alan Turing's life, the better part and also lonely part of his time.The Imitation Game has a heavy undertaking of presenting a man's personal story, and with excellent acting and amazing script, it has done so marvelously.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
who really cracked Enigma...,"I cannot review this film because i haven't seen it but when i hear about a British mathematician who cracked Enigma code i cannot escape one sad thought... It has been more than 70 years and they still cannot recognize polish involvement into cracking Enigma.Four Polish mathematicians constructed a machine which was kind of a clone of a German machine , they cracked it and sent it ,with many obvious difficulties, to UK.And only because of this great work further cracking was possible...I bet there is not a single word mentioned about Poles like there was no word in previous English film from 2001 titled Enigma ,where funny enough the bad guy, a German spy was a Pole... But that's OK ,let them make the films showing how great they were helping to end the war, here in Poland we know how it really was ...",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The Imitation Game - Review,"I went into this movie with pretty low expectations. I'm not a mathematician. I was expecting this movie to have a bunch of mumbo jumbo about math (stuff I wouldn't understand.) I walked out of the theater feeling like I'd just watched one of the best movies of the year.Benedict Cumberbatch played Alan Turing to perfection. The way Cumberbatch moved, talked, and the way he interacted with people was extremely well done. All of the actors in the movie delivered top notch performances. I felt like everyone was believable in the roles that they were playing.The movie was very engaging. There were math problems and such that were in the movie, however, I didn't feel lost or left behind playing catch-up while these problems where being played out on screen. Also, the banter in the movie was fantastic. I loved the dialog and conversations that all of the characters had amongst each other.There was never a dull moment. I felt like there were plenty of twist and turns that kept me interested in what was happening. I was extremely invested in all of the characters and there situations. The story was also very-well crafted and paced appropriately.I feel like this movie is not just about a man trying to crack a code to stop a war; this movie is about a person dealing with life's problems while he tries to crack a code to stop a war.From the opening frame to the last shot... I was invested, I was open, I was moved, I was touched, I laughed, and I learned something new.I highly recommend this movie for movie lovers, people who love extremely well-crafted movies, well executed stories, and strong performances.I did feel like the ending was a bit rushed and a little sloppy, but that's about it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
An enthralling experience,"There are not enough words in my mind to sufficiently praise the performance of Benedict Cumberbatch in this film. He moves from unlikeable to endearing without even a hint of effort, he delivers the film's razor sharp dialogue with such deadpan that half the audience burst out laughing every few minutes. He is compelling, convincing and so genuine that Turing's fate becomes even more terrible to imagine. He will be and should be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor.If it is indeed possible to move away from Cumberbatch's performance and observe the rest of the film, there is still plenty to rave about. The film's screenplay is one of the best assets in its favour - filled with witty dialogue and plenty of enthralling scenes. The job interview between Charles Dance and Benedict Cumberbatch sets the tone for the rest of the film and is just one of many magnificent scenes. Alexander Lawther puts in a magnificently convincing performance as Turing as a child, Charles Dance is perfectly cast and endlessly entertaining, and Keira Knightley manages to hold her own in her scenes with Cumberbatch. Director Morten Tyldum has done a magnificent job creating the most emotional scenes in the film.The only tiny flaw in the film is that very little is done to depict Turing's sexuality. It feels very much like Tyldum is playing it safe by not showing any scenes in which his sexuality is demonstrated. However, this is only a minor flaw because Cumberbatch's heartbreaking performance removes any doubt that he is genuinely gay.The most heartbreaking true story I've seen since Milk , The Imitation Game is biopic cinema at its best.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
One of THE VERY BEST films of the past decade,"Most people go to a movie hoping to see what ""they anticipate or expect"" based on a published story line (example as posted on IMDb or a local newspaper) and the posted movie genre of their preference that being an action, drama, thriller, romance, comedy or other. Mrs. Shullivan and I use Friday nights as our date night, dinner and a movie. Our deal is that we alternate who gets to pick the film we are going to see. On this particular Friday night it was my turn to pick our film elixir so I chose the autobiography (slash) thriller, The Imitation Game, and what a fine elixir it was for both of us! For all the mediocre and truly bad movies we sit through, when you eventually discover a gem like The Imitation Game the movie drug hits you once again and you realize that yes, it is still worth putting on your coat, stepping out in to the cold night and putting down your hard earned cash to go to the theatre rather than wait to purchase a DVD copy for half the price a feature film, popcorn and drinks will cost you. The Imitation Game is the type of film that quite simply just keeps you intensely focused on that large screen and allows one to escape anything and everything that is happening around you as if you were sitting in an empty theatre and the film is playing to an audience of one.you.Obviously this autobiography has taken liberties with Alan Turing's actual events. To create a truly memorable film the relatively unknown screenwriter (Graham Moore) and director (Morten Tyldum) would need to utilize the 114 minutes film length to reflect not only actual events that take place over decades from mathematician's Alan Turing's academic years as an introverted and closeted homosexual but also as a mathematical genius, problem solver whose interactions with fellow classmates, military personnel and fellow code breakers would keep Alan Turing as an outcast always looking in. Benedict Cumberbatch plays Alan Turing with so much emotion and intensity that we the audience all were rooting for him to break the German's secretive code. When he eventually does break the code with his machine named (after his only friend from his school days) Christopher, Turing shows us how valuable he was to the British intelligence by realizing how effective mathematical probabilities really are in winning not the battle, but the war.This film depicts an unknown likely hero who through his efforts in building one of the very first computers saved hundreds, thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of peoples' lives with the assistance of Alan Turing's genius. Benedict Cumberbatch's performance has been rewarded with both a nomination for an Academy Award and Golden Globe nomination as Best Actor of January 2015. Whether he wins or loses these awards Mrs. Shullivan and I reward him with our gratitude for keeping our interest to continue to support the theatre box office.There are some other excellent performances as well such as by Keira Knightley who plays the only female code breaker Joan Clarke and true friend of Alan Turing, Matthew Goode who plays Hugh Alexander originally assigned as the Team Leader of the code breakers but is eventually ousted by British Intelligence in favor of Alan Turing, the quirky smart-ass unlikeable code breaker but persistent to no end in breaking the German code. Mark Strong who played Major General Chief of British Secret Intelligence Service M16 also played a very convincing role.The Imitation Game does not waste one minute of screen time. This film embodies a superb story line, wonderful cinematography, true wit when needed, and a stellar cast of actors that will be remembered for decades by their performance in The Imitation Game. As I stated at the beginning of my movie appraisal, this week was my turn to choose and the last film we saw was Mrs. Shullivan's choice and she chose a musical genre that was simply a stinker of a film. To break the mystery of Mrs. Shullivan's last (lousy) movie pick you will have to go back to my previous review under the genre ""musical"". Good luck if you choose to take the challenge and break the code.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
In Memory of The Unsung Heroes of World War II,"The Second World War is the single greatest phenomenon in the history of mankind. No other event comes even marginally close to the impact World War II had on global scale for it not only altered the political & social structure around the world but also ended up enriching the fields of art, literature, films & television with countless events, so many that even after 70 years we're still in the process of discovering entirely new things about it.Now The Imitation Game doesn't really bring anything new to the film canvas in that regard but it sheds more light on the unsung heroes whose wartime breakthroughs & contributions played a major role in changing the outcome of the last great war. The film tells the story of the legendary cryptanalyst Alan Turing & his team of code-breakers racing against time to break the Nazi Germany's Enigma-encrypted codes in order to get ahead of their enemy.Brilliantly directed by Morten Tyldum, the entire story is narrated in 3 overlapping plot lines, each covering a different stage of Turing's life, and is quite gripping when those elements align to work as one but then it also stumbles with its non-linear narration whenever it shifts from one timeline to another, which feels abrupt & intrusive. Graham Moore's screenplay wonderfully glosses over Turing's life & plays out many events in a pretty authentic manner.Coming to technical aspects, Production Design team's most notable work is the electro- mechanical bombe itself which Turing designed to decipher the Enigma-generated ciphers. Filming locations are wisely chosen to keep it as authentic as possible. Cinematography makes fine use of camera, neatly balances the colour hues & retains the image sharpness till the end. Editing is a mixed bag, while Alexandre Desplat once again delivers with a very fitting score.As far as performances go, The Imitation Game features a reliable cast in Benedict Cumberbatch, Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, Mark Strong, Charles Dance & others, and the performances are definitely one of its stronger aspects. Leading from the front is Cumberbatch who is absolutely outstanding in the role of Alan Turing, Knightley is surprisingly good as Joan Clarke & the rest of the supporting cast also chip in with vital contributions to lift the story up by a great extent.On an overall scale, The Imitation Game is an interesting portrait of an eccentric individual whose works have been highly influential in the fields of computer science & artificial intelligence, is a heartbreaking story of a misfit who never publicly received the credit for his game-changing wartime efforts, and is a biting view of one of United Kingdom's most disgraceful acts that covers how badly he was treated in the post-war era. An engaging, entertaining & satisfying flick from start to finish, this historical drama is worth a shot.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The Imitation Game,"The Imitation Game, is a masterpiece of a film that I feel so glad to have been able to see on the big screen. My last visit to the theatre, I saw The Theory of Everything, which has a fair bit in common with The Imitation Game. Both are excellent films and some of the best of 2014, they are both British films, they are both period pieces, both based on true stories and real people and they deal with main characters (Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything and Alan Turing here), who are socially awkward and have very distinct types of personalities, but at the same time, while they may be limited in their social abilities both of these men were brilliant and both have changed how we view things and life here in the 21st century. Both films are equally fascinating dealing with genius minds at work and also how these characters function and deal with everyday life with their limited social abilities and other things that would later lead to difficulties for both of them. Both stories have elements of tragedy in and to them and yet at the same time both of these films and characters we learn to respect greatly and have admiration for, even with their flaws, errors of judgement and little idiosyncrasies. With, The Theory of Everything, as I stated in my review, I knew a little bit about Stephen Hawking before I saw the film. Not a lot mind you, bur I knew who he was and a little bit here and there about him. The Imitation Game, is a different thing altogether though. My history is more than rusty and I knew nothing about Alan Turing, or what he had accomplished and the story behind his life and work before I saw this film. In a way that was too bad that I did not know such a genius mind as his and all that he had accomplished, but on the other end of the spectrum, it was probably a good thing that I didn't know anything going into this film because everything that happened during this film was a complete and total surprise to me and I had no idea how the film would turn out (besides some of the more obvious and the little history I do know), but that I had not known about was surprisingly fascinating and captivated me while thoroughly entertaining me and giving me a rich and very rewarding cinematic experience. I would imagine that most people around my age group, or younger, would probably fall into the same category knowing little about the person, or subject matter, but again that doesn't matter and it makes the film all the more an educational and fascinating experience to be had. The screenplay here which is based on a book and of course, real facts is an excellent adapted screenplay giving much historical accuracy and deep study into the events and things that plagued these brilliant minds as well as the whole world during the second world war. The screenplay is also a great character study and delves deep into what makes Alan Turing, the man he is as well as exposing his insecurities, his social awkwardness, arrogance and pride as well as his downfalls and some of the torment he has carried with him his whole life as well. He is not just a simple character that is as easy to deconstruct as my review may make it seem. This is a multi layered character and person who has so much going on with his personality, emotions and what is in his mind that he is fascinating to study and to watch and the whole thing is further enhanced by Benedict Cumberbatch's spot on and excellent portrayal of him. Cumberbatch is now a household name and a popular one after his successful show and performance in the modern day Sherlock Holmes series as well as being in numerous excellent films over the past couple of years in supporting roles and doing a great job in them and now he has his own chance to shine, and boy does he ever. Keira Knightley, is also excellent in here as well. I find that when she is given great scripts and roles such as in Atonement, Seeking a Friend for the End of the World and now this, that she is a great actress as well and needs more of these type of roles. The whole cast here is excellent and worthy of acclaim and praise as well. The attention to detail during the film's period piece setting was both accurate and appropriate and I like how different aspects of Turing's life were brought up in this film showing many different sides and aspects of his life, some of which many of you do not know about and which I will not spoil for you in this review. All in all a extremely fascinating portrayal of an interesting man with a lot to offer, but dealing with his own demons as well and also this film does an excellent job of retelling an historical event and making it both fresh and important to today's movie audiences as well. The Imitation Game is a masterpiece and one of the best films of 2014.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Good but not great telling of the story of Alan Turing,"Overrated by the critics. Cumberbatch gives a very good, but not award winning performance. Mark Strong and Charles Dance were fine as usual. The script is hackneyed and very weak. You know that the melodrama and incidents are made up to add dramatic tension. That effort fails. I'm sure that the story as presented in this film has little relation to the details of Turing's life. His parents and older Baronet Brother are never mentioned. He is shown to be a runner, but nothing about th fact that he is a word class and extreme runner is mentioned. It sounds like nitpicking, but its just an illustration of the failure to attend to details. The contributions of the others on Turing's team are given little consideration. The 1996 BBC TV film about Turing called Breaking the Code staring the great Sir Derek Jacobi is much better than this over-hyped version. Go to youtube and watch that instead.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Cumberbatch's power as an actor elevates the film,"When it comes to The Imitation Game I think that in the future I will remember this movie as a great vehicle for Benedict Cumberbatch to score an Oscar nomination (his first). There is no doubt that Cumberbatch is one of the most talented actors of his generation and in this film he finally gets the role that writes his name in movie history. Assuming he keeps up the great work he's done so far, I believe this is only the start for him.The story is of Alan Turing, a brilliant English mathematician who, along with a team of equally brilliant minds, cracked the Nazi code Enigma and ultimately played an instrumental part in winning the war for the allies. What makes him the idealized subject for a biographical film, however, is his troubled sexual orientation. Given the mentality that was a part of the world at that time, Turing's homosexuality led to him being very secretive. In the movie we get side plot lines that explore the past heartbreak that this genius man endured and also the aftermath of the war and how it took it's toll on our him.As I said before, Benedict Cumberbatch is simply brilliant in the representation of Alan Turing. The man sells insecurity, meticulousness and emotion like no other. There may, in fact, be no part that the he can't play in nothing other than astounding fashion. In his shadow, I would say that all the supporting players are on par with each other. I personally enjoyed seeing Matthew Goode and Mark Strong respectively offering different types of character in a strong manner. As far as Knightley's nominated performance goes, I feel she was solid and was a fresh female presence in an otherwise men's show.The directing and writing are mostly just above average unfortunately. And I say this because the movie was captivating enough to hold my attention, yet it was the great acting by the cast, with special consideration for the leading man, that elevated the movie . Nonetheless, The Imitation Game is a somewhat valid choice if you want to reach the surface of Turing's contributions to the world and his turbulent private life. As far as I'm concerned, I will look back and appreciate Cumberbatch's enigmatic performance in future viewings.Rating: 7,5-8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

A Biopic masterpiece,A superbly written script which keeps the viewer engrossed in the storyline from the very start. It is not only an apt tribute to war hero but also to a high caliber mathematical prodigy. The tenacity of Alan as well as the group is a lesson to be learned by all.The movie also makes the viewer sympathize with Alan's personal problems and the challenges he faces because of his homosexuality. This movies would surely help a section of the viewers to grow sympathetic towards the LGBT community and the need to give them space in our society. A must watch for people interested in biopics as well as in world war movies.,9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Unlocking the Genius Within,"""The Imitation Game"" is a compelling historical drama directed by Morten Tyldum that delves into the incredible life and achievements of Alan Turing, a brilliant mathematician and cryptanalyst. Starring Benedict Cumberbatch in a mesmerizing performance as Turing, the film offers an intriguing glimpse into the fascinating world of code-breaking during World War II.Set against the backdrop of the war, the film immerses us in the tense atmosphere of Bletchley Park, where a team of intellectuals is striving to decipher the seemingly unbreakable German Enigma machine. Turing, a socially awkward and enigmatic character, brings his unconventional thinking and unmatched intellect to the table, forever changing the course of history.One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its ability to humanize Turing and explore the complex layers of his personality. Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal is exceptional, capturing Turing's idiosyncrasies and inner struggles with great sensitivity. He brilliantly conveys Turing's intelligence, vulnerability, and the weight of his personal secrets. The supporting cast, including Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke, Matthew Goode as Hugh Alexander, and Charles Dance as Commander Denniston, delivers solid performances that complement Cumberbatch's acting prowess.The narrative unfolds through a series of flashbacks, blending the wartime events with Turing's troubled past. These flashbacks add depth to the story, revealing the emotional scars Turing carries from his childhood, particularly his tragic experiences at boarding school. They provide context for his relentless pursuit to crack the Enigma code, showcasing his unwavering determination and the price he pays for his brilliance.The film masterfully balances moments of intense suspense with poignant character development. As the team works tirelessly against the ticking clock to break the code, the audience is kept on edge, feeling the weight of the war's impending consequences. The tension is palpable, and the script skillfully highlights the moral dilemmas faced by the codebreakers, including the sacrifices they had to make to protect their nation.""The Imitation Game"" not only sheds light on Turing's intellectual genius but also highlights the injustice he endured due to his homosexuality. The film unflinchingly explores the persecution he faced during an era of extreme discrimination, where being different was considered a crime. It serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of embracing diversity and recognizing the immense contributions made by individuals who challenge societal norms.Visually, the film captures the period with great attention to detail. The cinematography beautifully captures the tension and secrecy surrounding Bletchley Park, and the production design transports viewers to the wartime era. The score by Alexandre Desplat adds depth to the emotional beats of the story, further enhancing the film's overall impact.If there is a minor flaw in ""The Imitation Game,"" it lies in the film's tendency to simplify certain historical events and characters for the sake of dramatic storytelling. While it successfully conveys the essence of Turing's story, some artistic liberties may leave purists wanting a more accurate representation of the events. However, as a cinematic experience, it remains captivating and emotionally resonant.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Amazing Storytelling,"During World War II, mathematician Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) tries to crack the enigma code with help from fellow mathematicians.Some people have complained about the accuracy of this film, particularly that the Poles are not given the credit they deserve. That is fair, but the bottom line is that you have to sacrifice 100% accuracy in order to make for a good story. And this is a very good story, full of moral ambiguity. A philosophy class could have a field day with how many ethical issues are presented: the war, hiding the code, destroying records, chemical castration...Cumberbatch did a superb job and if he was not already on people's radars, this will put him there. In a year with Eddie Redmayne doing a spot-on Stephen Hawking and an incredible buzz around Michale Keaton (for some unclear reason), this is not an Oscar year for him. But as a whole, this seems a real contender for Best Picture, or at the least Best Screenplay.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Turing as a genius,"You will probably like the film if you like all the WW2 stories, but have not read too many books about the Enigma. The film takes Turing's perspective, focusing on the person, on his ideas, on his own world that no one understands, the real genius-type.For me it was too long a bit, showing too much about the political games and less about the exact working mechanism of Christopher. Well, it's a question what is better, of course.I loved however Benedict's performance, it is a shame he had to compete with Eddie Redmayne for the Oscars, because this way he had no chance to win, with a normally extraordinary performance. It is no doubt Eddie had to win, but still. :)",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Is it true?,"I'm really waiting to watch that movie, I like Benedict Cumberbatch but I have doubts (again) if it's a true story.You can find a lot info about the truth of enigma in the web:( First part is from BBC and the second from Daily ) Bevore that I give you an example mentioned by Daily: No. 303 (""Kościuszko"") Polish Fighter Squadron (Polish: 303 Dywizjon Myśliwski ""Warszawski im. Tadeusza Kościuszki"") was one of 16 Polish squadrons in the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the Second World War. It was the highest scoring of these 16 Polish-manned RAF squadrons during the Battle of Britain. Yet Polish troops - still under the command of Poland's independent government in exile - were forbidden from taking part in official VE Day celebrations due to Britain's wish to appease Stalin.BBC 1...Prince Andrew handed over an Enigma machine taken from a captured Nazi submarine, as a ""symbol of our gratitude"". ""The Enigma codes would not have been broken if it were not for the knowledge of Polish mathematicians,"" he was quoted as saying at the start of a two-day visit.Mr Buzek said he was ""greatly satisfied"" that the UK officially recognised that Enigma was decoded by the Poles. Polish historians say three Polish mathematicians - Marian Rejewski, Jerzy Rozycki and Henryk Zygalski - broke the Enigma code in 1933. In July 1939, just before the war, Poland gave Britain and France replicas of the Enigma encoding machine, helping the Allies decipher secret Nazi messages. According to British accounts, British cryptographers cracked the code a year before war broke out. Mr Buzek asked Britain on Monday to change the Encyclopaedia Britannica entry on Enigma to credit the Poles for their role in breaking the system.2. To many, the name Bletchley Park is synonymous with code-breaking glory by the British during World War Two. After all, it was there that Englishman Alan Turing and his team of mathematicians cracked the ciphers of the Nazis' Enigma machine - a feat credited with shortening the war by two years. But now, the Polish Government has launched a campaign to highlight the important - and overlooked - role played by its nation in solving the Enigma code. In 1932, a group of cryptologists from the Polish Cipher Bureau - Marian Rejewski, Jerzy Rozycki and Henryk Zygalski - discovered three ways of deciphering Enigma readings. Seven years later, just before war broke out, the Poles handed over their knowledge of the Enigma codes, as well as Polish-built replicas of the machines, to British and French Intelligence officers near Warsaw. The rest is history - but not the complete history, as far as Senator Piotr Zientarski is concerned. 'We have a duty to remind people just what the Polish cryptologists did,' he told the Daily Telegraph. The government official said that in recognition of the trio's efforts, the upper house of Poland's parliament has passed a resolution in their honour to 'restore justice'. The resolution reads: 'In both popular literature and official information, the public was told that the breaking of the Enigma codes was due to the work of the British Intelligence services to the complete omission of the work of Polish scientists.' The Germans, who had been using the technology since the late 1920s, believed the codes were impossible to crack. Using a complicated system of rotors, the machine would encode messages before sending them via Morse code to another machine. If the receiving machine had been programmed with the same settings - one of 158 million million million combinations - the message would be deciphered. However the team of cryptologists, linguists, scientists and data analysts at Bletchley, in Buckinghamshire, led by Londoner Turing, were able to break it. At its peak, the team was cracking 6,000 encrypted German Enigma messages every day - building on the principles set out by Rejewski, Rozycki and Zygalski. Jan Rulewski, a senator from the governing Civic Platform party, said: 'This resolution restores justice. Not only did the Western Allies marginalise the achievements of Polish cryptographers but the Soviets did the same. 'They were silent about the Polish contribution to saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of troops fighting on all fronts.' The film Enigma (made in 2001), starring Kate Winslet and set at Bletchley, has also upset the Poles - it not only downplays their contribution but also, the only Pole in the film is a traitor. The resentment adds to the wider feeling in the country that their contribution to the Allies' victory has been under-appreciated. Polish troops fought in North Africa, Italy and Normandy, and took part in the Battle for Berlin. In the Battle of Britain, Polish pilots had the highest kill rates. Yet Polish troops - still under the command of Poland's independent government in exile - were forbidden from taking part in official VE Day celebrations due to Britain's wish to appease Stalin.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Cracking Enigma was probably a lot more team work than shown in this movie,"Cumberbatch pays Alan Turing, the mathematician who managed to crack the Enigma code, WITH a team of other people and then proceed to get infamously arrested for indecent exposure. The core of the movie is the cracking of Enigma with some flash back to Turing youth and flash forward to Turing last year (actually, the movie starts in the 50s and then jumps back to the war years – a completely useless editing idea).Altogether not a bad story and certainly a great Cumberbatch and Knightley interpretation. The supporting actors are also good and there is some moment of British humor to lighten the atmosphere. The only thing I find objectionable is that the movie gives the idea that Turing was the only one who actually cracked the code. The solitary genius who did it all on his own and even against his own team - with the exception of the Knightley character.All this to put Turing on an even higher pedestal and to underline that he was such as genius AND gay. Basically gay = genius in this movie. Which seems rather far-fetched, because it surely is a fact that not all gay people are geniuses, just like not all straight people are The again, the ""solitary"" hero is a concept a lot more fascinating than ""team work"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Feh!  Don't See This Movie,"So I just saw this film tonight, and I quite enjoyed it. It was interesting and engaging and entertaining and everything you'd want from a movie. I went home quite satisfied, and indeed had my interest in Alan Turing, the main character, piqued. So, when I got home, I did a little online research.Now, I know that this was a movie, and not a documentary, so I expected that there would be some liberties taken with the story, but hoped they would not be anything too significant.

This Film Should Be Required Viewing in Public Schools,"While still suffering from PTSD after having sat through ""Birdman"" the night before, I decided that surely there couldn't be any of the 2015 ""Best Picture"" nominees that could conceivably be worse than that monstrosity of a film, and so I decided to watch ""The Imitation Game"", one of the outliers for Best Picture, but also one that may stand a chance considering that its director has also been nominated for an Oscar.I couldn't have been more pleased with this movie. Granted, some of my contentment may have been due to my viewing of this film being paired with the insufferable ""Birdman"", but what I found in ""The Imitation Game"" was a genuinely intriguing story with a well written script and a well produced film, the final product of which was a wonderful movie going experience. While ""Birdman"" makes one wonder how ingratiating a ""Best Picture"" nomination should really be these days, ""The Imitation Game"" reminds us that there are still good movies being made that feature original stories that the world desperately needs to hear.A cursory summary of the film is that Benedict Cumberbatch plays the role of Alan Turing, a mathematical genius who conceives of the world's first computer during World War II. The movie then tells the story of Turing's struggle to build the machine that would help the allies decipher Nazi radio codes and thereby win the war.Cumberbatch turns out a strong performance, as does the rest of the cast. Keira Knightly is pleasing to the eye, as always, and her performance is deserving of her Best Supporting Actress nomination. Most importantly, though, is that this film conveys an important moral —namely that societal norms sometimes (especially historically) impose themselves in terrible ways with horrific consequences. Turing's story is one that the world needs to hear now, more than ever, as it struggles with LGBT rights. ""The Imitation Game"" is cinema at its finest—important narratives taking life on screen in a way that engages the audience while pleasing the viewer. 10/10 stars!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A fascinating portrait of a troubled innovator,"The life and career of mathematician Alan Turing would have always made an excellent biopic, so the success of 'The Imitation Game' in terms of its narrative shouldn't come as a surprise. This is coupled with a masterful performance from Benedict Cumberbatch as the enigmatic Turing.Though featuring little to no battle scenes in a film centered on WWII, 'The Imitation Game' rarely has any trouble depicting the high stakes facing its protagonist and his peers. Every second they toil away in their attempts to crack Nazi codes means more and more lives lost in the brutal conflict encompassing the globe.Cumberbatch portrays Turing as a brilliant if highly socially awkward innovator. He twitches and stutters constantly, with all of these seemingly insignificant physical traits and tics contributing to this depiction. As he struggles with external forces attempting to clamp down on his work, as well as his repressed homosexuality, Turing becomes, and behaves, more and more erratically. In recent years Cumberbatch has established himself as an acting powerhouse, and his role in 'The Imitation Game' will surely be added to the top of his portfolio.Many parallels are drawn between the revolutionary Nazi code-cracking computer Turing designs and Turing himself, an individual who at many points is deemed by his peers to be more machine than man. The supporting cast help strengthen this image, their unique, bubbly personalities contrasting with Turing's withdrawn nature.Like 'The Social Network, 'The Imitation Game' functions as both a terrific historical account of technological innovation, as well as a fascinating character study of the depths one will go to to ensure the survival of their work. However, unlike The Social Network's Mark Zuckerberg, who is presented largely as a Machiavellian antagonist, Alan Turing is presented as a tragic hero, a man who helped save possibly millions of lives, but was ultimately punished ruthlessly for his personal life.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Narrator, intelligence, mind","I haven't had much time for movies lately, being caught in tumultuous events in Greece and all they show about a broader game and narrative. I've had less time to write about them because I try not to write reviews about whether you should rent something or not. No one should care, least of all you.I'm primarily interested in a perception of how things come to be, the relationship between viewer and image, the mechanics of captivation of that viewer, the nature and role played in this by intuition, perception in general. And a key insight is that things must inspire their truth the way love inspires poetry and truth must be deeply felt otherwise we're only putting words together.This, it does not inspire me, it is not deeply felt in ways I'm attuned to (though it has deep feeling). It arrives at its tender insights with the canned sobriety of Oscar type films, indeed it is better than several winners of late, Argo and King's Speech come to mind, and this is almost entirely because its narrative gears align (and that Cumberbatch is great) and this is what I'd like to point out.So it begins with a narrator who capriciously muses that he's going to be in control of a narrative we're going to see and we'll have the responsibility of deciphering sense. Something has been stolen from him as the film begins, something he has kept secret for long that suspicious policemen set out to investigate. The spy narrative that follows is about the same man having to wrestle control of a narrative and decipher its sense; German communications during WWII.So when we get to the end and gears align during an interview (which incidentally is designed to align with the Turing Test) we get to note that what was stolen from him, after contributing spectacular work for the salvation of humanity (from Nazi peril), was nothing short of full expression of his work, his sexuality, his freedom. We also get to note a completely unevolved social machine that mangles difference in its cogs, the child prodigy in public school and the homosexual man in public office alike.We see how the the larger narrative is driven by illogical instinct - it's the same instinct that drives boys at school to force him under the floor, nations to senseless war and to laws that repress.And with a little discerning on our part, how it's this illogicality when it takes tangible shape around us that allows us to perfect notions and narratives, devise solutions - the ENIGMA work only possible because of rival German machines designed to confound sense, antiwar sentiment because of horrible war, acceptance because of senseless repression.And we see how the breaking of the German cipher was only possible because of human illogicality in the gears of the machine (sloppy operators, laziness of habit). And deeper yet how this illogicality extends to a game of flirting in the local pub that completely mystifies Turing; humor, love, poetry, emotion, all no less illogical than war.So as a biopic this is probably okay, though I question the decision to end it with a despondent Turing and a suicide. But I miss the more interesting kind of insight about a mind that tries to balance in a world where any attempt to force a clean narrative and logic only prevents us from skiing on the turbulence that lets us go places. This is too clean.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Could have been so much more,"At the beginning of the movie the Turing character tells us to pay attention, that he won't repeat himself, that he'll go over things fast. What a stupid way to start a movie.After WWII someone notifies some cop that there was a break-in at Turing's house. Cops arrive. Everything is in disarray. Turing tells them that nothing's missing and to get lost. He treats them like crap. One of them finds it suspicious and instead of being glad that there's no case here, he starts to look into Turing, apparently he has nothing else to do in life.Now we are taken to wartimes. Turing shows up in some commander's office to announce that he should be hired because only he can solve Enigma. That's the machine the Nazis use to code their military messages. Turing comes across as arrogant and full of himself, again, but the commander goes for it. He assembles a team to work on breaking the enigma code. Problem is there isn't just one code but that it changes every day. Turing demands 100000 pounds to build a machine that will work on the codes. The commanders laughs it off. So Turing sends a letter to Churchill himself who agrees. Now Turing is in charge of the whole operation. He fires some team members and recruits new ones via a public puzzle challenge.This gives him the opportunity to work on his pet project--a calculating machine. He keeps building it while everyone else works on code-breaking including presumably some little girl he recruited.Now for no good reason we go to Turing's youth at school. He was awkward with no social skills and obsessive-compulsive. The other boys bullied him. Except one who helped him, who gave him a code and cipher book to read. They developed a friendship and little Turing ""falls in love"" with him, whatever that may mean for a school boy.The cop in the meantime digs into Turing's life only to find--nothing. Everything is top secret. He forges papers to request his military file--it's an empty envelope. Somehow the cops find out that before the break-in Turing was with another younger man, so they call him in.Meanwhile the code-team makes no progress, until through good old-fashioned human intelligence, Turing a la Gregory House, realizes that there are some patterns in all Nazi communications, and now once they feed some of that into the machine, the manage to break the enigma code. But...Turing realizes they can't use the information because it would give away the secret to the Nazis that the Brits have succeeded. So instead he and his team provide MI6 with some probabilities so they can figure out how to use this information while keeping the Nazis in the dark.After the war it all has to be destroyed and kept a secret. And now we meet up with Turing as he's being interviewed by the cop, or rather, Turing is confessing it all to him--secrecy be damned. Turing is convicted and chooses to be chemically castrated instead of facing jail. In the end we learn his fate.The Imitation Game starts strong. The whole Enigma operation is fascinating. Turing's arrogance is entertaining. And while not very socially adept, he's a good authority figure when he's dealing with his area of expertise. His friendship with the girl is cute, but that whole story is pointless as it only aims to show that back then, there were different expectations for women--shocking news! Also pointless are the childhood scenes that tell us nothing about Turing's intelligence. Did he or didn't he stand out as a kid for his smarts? Was it evident back then that he had potential? The movie doesn't bother to tell us.Also missing are some details about the Turing machine. I assume that this thing was revolutionary at the time. Or maybe not? Another thing the movie doesn't care about. How did Turing come upon the idea of the machine? How it work? How did the input work? What does it do with it? Some more technical aspects would have made the movie much more fascinating. Instead the movie-makers focus on the homosexual aspect for some reason and try to imply that Turing's genius was because he was a homosexual, which is laughable.I was hoping the movie makers would treat the issue of homosexuality with some class and finesse, if they felt the need to address it all, instead they went completely bonkers. And ended up glorifying it, instead of the man and his genius.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
'Sometimes it is the people who no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.',"THE IMITATION GAME is brilliant on so many levels that to single out peaks is frustrating. Fist the actual history recreated by the film is brilliant. The book by Andrew Hodges who joined Graham Moore in a the intensely intelligent screenplay, the direction and weaving in and out of clips from WW II with the tension of creativity meeting science meeting personal issues by Morton Tyldum is exceptional, the courage by all involved to share the homophobia of England during this period of time and the eventual suicide of the genius who solved the Enigma due to his 'crime' of being homosexual, and last the cast – all spot on and terrific.The startling fact is that this is a true story.

The Imitation Game,"During World War II, mathematician Alan Turing tries to crack the enigma code with help from fellow mathematicians.The Imitation Game stars a brilliant bunch of British actors such as Keira Knightley, Benedict Cumberbatch, Mathew Goode, Allen Leech, Charles Dance and Mark Strong. I've already heard quite a bit about this movie so I was really eager to see it and I had the opportunity to attend a premiere of the film on Monday evening. A brilliant, brilliant, brilliant work by Benedict Cumberbatch. The man is a masterful actor, he's genuinely good in this movie; me writing those things about how amazing he is, it's almost a cliché at this point. He just nailed it and 300% deserves his Oscar nomination for best actor in a leading role. In addition to be well performed this film is also very well directed by Morten Tyldum, who is nominated for best director as well. The work he did with this film by portraying this time period in which people were actually fighting a war without ever touching any guns, it feels like their purpose is even more important than the physical combats that are going on. Moreover, Alan Turing is not the most likable person at first, a bit rude but really smart. It's complicated to understand him but through Benedict Cumberbatch performance, the script and the direction you just find yourself liking this man. This movie is not just about a man who is gay in a time period where it was literally illegal. It's largely about the struggle of hiding who you are and the difficulties that come with it. I think Cumberbatch got it right: the pain and torture it must be for someone to imitate something you're not.Overall this film looks terrific, the score and performances are excellent and the dialogue is so good that at one point you don't think at it like a dialogue anymore as you're so invested in the movie and the plot.

Emotional and tense. Historical accuracy be damned; this movie works.,"All I really knew going into ""The Imitation Game"" was that the poster made it look good, that Benedict Cumberbatch was playing the lead and that the movie was about Alan Turing, which many people consider the father of the modern computer. When I left, I was pleased with my experience not only because I ""learned things"" (I always take ""based on a true story"" with a grain of salt), but mostly I was pleased because it's a movie that got me thinking. I like turning my brain off to a dumb action movie as much as the next guy, but when a movie gets you to re-examine the world around you, that's something special. The film shows us Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) and his team of code-breakers' efforts to crack the Enigma Machine, an encoding device used by the Nazis during World War II. Turing is convinced that the previous efforts, all done by hand were more than fruitless, they were foolish. The only chance they have of cracking the codes and winning the war is to create a machine, one the likes of no one (at least no one in the 40's) has ever seen. The film follows the team's efforts as well as Turing's life before, and after the war.This movie had me thinking a lot about the geniuses we've seen throughout history. Alan Turing (at least as portrayed in this movie) is a strange man, one that does not fit in particularly well with the rest of society at his time. He doesn't react to humour well, he is easily dismissive of others if they are doing things he doesn't agree with and he's not just dedicated to his work, he's obsessed with it. People don't like him instinctively because he's weird and that's a big hurdle he has to overcome because his code-breaking machine is a very expensive piece of equipment made to be in the service of military men, who are not particularly well known for their acceptance of wild ideas. I wondered, as the film progressed, how many geniuses throughout history were similarly ostracized or misunderstood. To make something new, something that no one else has ever thought of, you have to be a little bit off your mark, because you're thinking in a different way than everybody else is, right? Many visionaries must have felt profoundly lonely in their days because of the way society reacted to their eccentricities. What I really liked about the movie is that it put me right there, in Alan Turing's shoes as he struggled day in and day out to get his machine to work, desperately trying to make it to decipher code faster, to show to others that the machine he is putting together is not a waste of time and money. I'm not particularly computer literate, but even I could see that the machine he was working on was a dynamite idea. Every time someone came in and threatened to tear it apart, every time the machine failed to perform as it was supposed to, I was on the edge of my seat. I saw something that very few people in the movie could, that this guy was a genius and that you're not necessarily going to understand what someone that thinks outside the box is doing, but if you just give them time and space, you will get results.Another aspect of the movie that I really enjoyed comes later in the movie, in Turing's life after the war. Without revealing what happens, it's one of those scenarios where you look back at people who were doing what was considered socially acceptable at the time, and you hate them. I understand that some of the behaviour at the time wasn't ""wrong"" by their standards, but I still found myself outraged and the words ""barbarians"" came to mind more than once. It got me wondering how our customs of today will be looked at in the future. Just as the generals and peers of Alan Turing dismissed him as a fool or a degenerate and we now look back and them with anger, will we be looked at by future generations as savages? The portion of the movie that dealt with the building of Turing's machine had me excited to see what would happen next. The segments that dealt with his life before and after WWII had my heart wrenching. I found myself becoming very emotional and I will admit that I cried a little bit at the end of the movie.I wrote so much about what the movie meant to me emotionally that I almost didn't leave any room to talk about the technical aspects. Firstly, there are some dynamite performances here. Benedict Cumberbatch shines as he usually does, but I also thought that some of the secondary characters were very good. I hope that when people talk about what was good in this movie, they don't forget to mention Keira Knightley (who plays an underdog, just like Turing and had me equally captivated) and Mark Strong as Maj. Gen Stewart Menzies who brings in some harsh truths about war that devastated me. I can't think of anyone that was bad, so you'll have to forgive me if I don't list everyone here. I thought the ending of the film was particularly powerful, that the movie as a whole was very exciting (even if I kind of knew where the Enigma machine thing was going) and it actually had me thinking a lot about war as a whole, about how it affects people in the service of the army in so many different ways, and seldom in a positive fashion. I really think ""The Imitation Game"" is a movie you should seek out. It's powerful, it isn't just a neat little story about the first steps towards modern-day computers, it's a lot more important than that.

Another Biopic powered by a strong lead performance from Cumberbatch,"""Sometimes it is the people who no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.""It is easy to fall in love with The Imitation Game because it is a fact-based film about a man who in Winston Churchill's words ""made the single biggest contribution to Allied victory in the war against Nazi Germany."" Alan Turing's story is one worth being portrayed on film because he played a huge role in shaping our history as one of the pioneers of modern-day computing. In school we are all taught what a huge factor the soldiers and allied forces played in winning the war after the Normandy landings, but little is known about these code breakers that were able to crack the unbreakable Enigma machine that the Germans used during the War. From the opening scene, Norwegian director Morten Tyldum (Headhunters), catches our attention and delivers a powerful (although by the books) biopic. The film isn't groundbreaking and it follows most of the genre conventions biopics do, but it does so through some great performances and a solid production design that immerses us into the decades of the 40's and 50's. The film is told in non-linear fashion beginning with how Alan began being investigated by the Brtish authorities for indecent behavior. It later goes back 10 years to when Britain was at war with Nazi Germany and where Alan Turing began working with other scholars trying to crack the enemy's communication codes. The film jumps back and forth as we also get some background information of Alan's youth where he was introduced to the world of codes and cyphering. Alan's story is fascinating and deserves a big screen adaptation as strong as this one because despite being a genius and having saved thousands of lives by shortening the war, he was disgraced and shamed for his homosexual behavior when he should've been hailed as a war hero. The film's greatest strength is the inspiring fact-based story itself.Benedict Cumberbatch has delivered several groundbreaking performances over his career, but I doubt he's been as great as he is in The Imitation Game. Cumberbatch transforms himself completely and becomes Alan Turing. He invested himself for this role and it completely payed off. He portrays the conflicting emotions and inner turmoil of his character in an authentic and realistic way. Cumberbatch and Tyldum do an amazing job of honoring a man who never received the credit he deserved during his lifetime. Cumberbatch's performance and Tyldum's attention to detail in this period drama is what stands out other than the inspiring story adapted by Graham Moore. Keira Knightley and Mark Strong both deliver solid supporting performances as well. Knightley has received a lot of praise for her role here and deservedly so, but I was most pleased with Strong's strong performance as the MI6 director, Stewart Menzies. It's hard not to enjoy this film considering its story alone is fascinating, but Tyldum does deliver a solid biopic by working with a talented cast, having an eye for period detail, and hiring Alexandre Desplat as the composer giving the already emotional and touching story more depth.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Best movie of the year, by far.","Being aware that any movie adaptation of these historic events is going to fall a little short because of Hollywood drama that always gets added, I was quite surprised how well it came out in the end. Benedict Cumberbatch was a great choice for the lead role since he is obviously very good at playing eccentric geniuses. Keira Knightley wasn't in the same league, but that doesn't mean she did a poor job.The movie is very engaging. There was no chatter, small talk, cellphone browsing or sleeping - the audience was quiet, captivated and kept in a state of suspense. That's very impressive.Trying to cover several stages in the life of Alan Turing doesn't leave enough time to tell everything that needed to be told, but since it had to fit in a commercial, cinema-friendly 114 min package, I'd say that's quite understandable. It's not a proper biography, not a spy thriller, not a proper historic movie nor a drama, it's a weird combination that lacks something in every category and yet still delivers an awesome mash-up that will suck you in and keep you interested.Highly recommended!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Tyldum Swedish boredom,"Masterfully told and encompassing an emotional complexity, Tyldum's film is both engrossing and disturbing. It has genius aspirations in which it wants to exist in the cinematic world. It's an impeccable thriller, taut and brilliant, exploring the horrors of war along with the choices that doom mankind for all eternity. Tyldum is methodical and precise in which he decides to unravel the story, Turing is one of the fallen heroes of our history and his story stands as one of the most tragic. Screenwriter Moore crafts a murky, dark, yet totally enjoyable spy film that stands taller than any James Bond film ever released. It's a sure-fire Oscar contender for several Academy Awards including Best Picture. They should feel so lucky to have the gumption to choose something this methodical and majestic.Benedict Cumberbatch continues to climb the ladder as one of the best actors working today. After impressive performances August: Osage County, 12 Years a Slave, and TV's ""Sherlock,"" this is the role that will make him a bonafide movie star. Oscar-winner or not, this will be looked upon like the greats such as Gene Hackman in The French Connection or any legendary 70's movie that you love today. Cumberbatch hones in on all of Turing's character flaws and good qualities that make him a real person. He constructs him from the toes up, inflicting mannerisms and behaviors that all ring true. He stimulates all the sensual beats that keep us fixated on a performance. I can't help but go back to someone like Joaquin Phoenix in The Master, who delivered a construction of epic proportions. Though based on a real person, the talented Cumberbatch ignites his own masterpiece performance. He follows the demons of Turing down to his bones. Unsure, arrogant, and dismissive to the world around him, Turing shows only what he must, what he chooses, and every once in a while, we get a front seat to his soul. Thank you Cumberbatch.The rest of the cast is completely on their game. It's probably a contender for the SAG Ensemble prize. Academy Award nominee Keira Knightley, as the feisty and fiery Joan Clark, is as loose and comfortable as I've ever seen her. She wears Joan like an old coat from the back of the closet. Remembering it fondly and seeing that it fits just perfect. She has all the things that make up an Oscar nominee; a scene that will likely bring you to tears, plenty of scenes that play as the comic relief in a dark tale, and being simply charming in every part of the film.I don't know when it's going to happen but the world needs to make Matthew Goode a mega- star. In his brief time on-screen, Goode makes his mark, becoming essentially a co-anchor with Knightley of the supporting players, showcasing a reason to give this guy his own leading role sooner rather than later. As our resident sleazy authority figure, Charles Dance shows that he's still got it. Mark Strong and Allen Leech also deliver memorable, fascinating scenes, both getting an opportunity to shine.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Trite romanticism,"The film's main storyline transpires during the war years. While the Allies fight the Germans, the integrity of the quasi-Justice League that Denniston has built at the GC&CS is ostensibly compromised by Turing's incessant belief that the machine he's building will break the Enigma machine. That Winston Churchill himself bankrolls Turing's project when no one else will exudes an air of fiction given the way the narrative is prone to playing such acts of wheeling and dealing for shits and giggles, but the film's faithful replica of the bombe doesn't evoke such frivolity. No one stands before this ominous, monolith-like beacon of promise, with its wall of rotating, ever-clacking drums, without quaking at the thought of what their persistence in cryptanalyzing the Enigma can mean to the war effort. Watching the subservience of the film's characters to the very machine they built, then seeing how this almost existential panic informs ""the imitation game"" that, years later, Turing plays with Nock at the police station during a battle of wills, is close to a masterstroke.An ironic masterstroke, as the unease with which the filmmakers articulate Turing's devotion to exploring the possibility of machinery showing intelligent behavior is itself The Imitation Game's only sign of intelligent life. The trajectory of cryptanalyst Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley), from her potential being squandered by her parents to her brief engagement to Turing to, finally, her friendly visit with him just prior to his suicide, is a means for the film to slavishly shore up her bona fides as both a feminist and ""fag hag."" It's a fashionable pose, and given the liberties the film takes here and elsewhere, it's surprising that it refuses to penetrate Turing's carnality and allow Cumberbatch to truly wrestle with the torment of the man's sexuality. It does, though, reduce Turing in his last days to a Gollum-like creature who regards the bombe-like contraption in his flat as a precious reminder of his childhood crush at Sherborne. In this way, this real-life genius, a eunuch even before his castration, remains an enigma, seen only through a lens of psychoanalytically trite pulp romanticism.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

A brilliant movie!,"After so many years, people still manage to find ideas or stories to tell about the second world war that feel fresh and entertaining. I watched the imitation game with a complete lack of information about anything surrounding the life of its protagonist. I had never heard of Alan Turing or his life. Of course, the fact that governments kept his achievements secret for over 50 years has a lot to do with very few people knowing about his existence. This is why, even if posthumously, true justice was made by creating this film, and this great man can now receive the praise that he so rightfully deserves.The entire movie is created, as it should, with an non-ending set of tense situations and moments. Alan Turing is a brilliant man who is hired to end the war but he has no one to help him. In fact, the very people who hire him are the ones trying to get rid of him; in a world dominated by men, his greatest help comes from a girl; but her parents do not accept where she works, so to not see her go, Alan Turing gets engaged with her. But surprise surprise, he is homosexual. Everything, absolutely everything in the movie is done in such a way for you to be kept wondering. I guess the director probably added a lot of content to the actual facts and did not follow the original story to a tee. But in cases like this, when the movie is so entertaining, I accept a little invention.All in all, a highly recommended movie, full of beautiful images, great acting, and a great real story!

Falls a bit short on a number of counts.,"With the excellent Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead role, The Imitation Game is a movie that aspires to movie greatness, but I'm sorry to say, that in my humble opinion, it falls a bit short on a number of counts.It is the story of the brilliant scientist/mathematician, Alan Turing who was the man who almost single-handedly cracked the enigma code machine in the Second World War. This remarkable feat is generally acknowledged to have shortened the war by at least two years and saved thousands upon thousands of lives.It is also the story of a man who has been credited with the invention of the modern day computer.It is also the story of the man who was a homosexual, and who was prosecuted for committing (what were then considered to be) 'illegal' acts, and who subjected himself to state administered chemical castration rather than spend time in jail.It is also the story of a man who was treated so shabbily by the country who owed him so much that at the age of 39, he killed himself.It is a difficult story to tell in a couple of hours – especially when we know nothing about the really exciting part – the details of what exactly led up to Turing breaking of the enigma code during the war. We know he was hired to lead a team and he built and used a very primitive form of computer to break the code. More than that is still secret, or the records have long since been destroyed.The film writers decided to write what they thought was a clever piece of fiction in which Turing was continually fighting his bully- boy bosses; that his resentful, fellow workers all thought he was an idiot; that he was wasting valuable funds, and was probably a Russian spy. According to the film, he was at constant at risk of being fired.All the above is fiction. Indeed, they would have us believe that that it was only after Turing wrote directly to Churchill that he was put in charge and granted the funds to build his computer. (Fiction again.)It really is a load of tosh, and Charles Dance's role as Turing's ignorant, malevolent commanding Officer is so full of 'cartoon- evil', that for all the world, he comes across as a male manifestation of Creuella Deville. One of the most outrageous fictitious story lines concerns Turing's failure to report a Soviet spy to avoid being outed as gay. It is pure Hollywood invention, as are so many of the dramatic machinations that allegedly took place at Bletchley Park.It is a pity, as although I really don't like biopics unless they are very good – this might have been an exception, but sadly it isn't. The film didn't seem to know what it wanted to do – celebrate the genius of a man who shortened the war by two years and invented the computer, or show us how gays, even war heroes, were so appallingly treated by the authorities in Britain back in the early 50's. I think it tries to do both and falls a bit flat on both countsIt is still a very watchable, entertaining movie, and Cumberbatch and Dance are always worth seeing – whatever films they are in, as is the gorgeous Keira Knightley. But I don't think Benedict quite nailed the role – maybe he tried a little too hard.It just isn't that good. Honestly – I've seen a couple of documentaries on Turing that are much better. Incidentally, it is a fact that Churchill later acknowledged Turing's massive contribution to the war effort, which shortened the war by at least two years, but no mention was made of the disgraceful way he was treated in the early 1950's because he was gay.Turing was recently pardoned by the then PM Gordon Brown for his 'crime' of being a practicing homosexual, but isn't it about time he was posthumously awarded a knighthood? After all, he is one of Britain's greatest ever heroes. If the likes of Cliff Richard, Mick Jagger and Bruce Forsyth and Angelina Jolie can become Knights and Dames of the Realm, then surely Alan Turing is equally deserving of the honour.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Great movie!!,"The Imitation Game was extremely well done. The directors managed to focus the movie on the core issue of decoding Nazi communications and help end a nefarious war waged by Hitler - all through the eyes of a scientists, not a politician, or the military, or activists, etc. Benedict Cumberbatch was brilliant as Alan Turing and so was Keira Knightley as a supporting actress. The obvious tragedy surrounding sexuality during that period of human history in Great Britain was portrayed with class and substance. This movie makes a powerful argument for tolerance and respect for professional ideas and personal choice alike. The conviction with which Turing approached his profession is truly an inspiration. Great movie!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Endearing, thoughtful, sensitive, amazing","After a whirlwind of feelings of anger, sadness, and reflection, writing a review is what i must do first.The film was downright amazing, and it's really hard for me to say that for many. The story was intriguing and meaningful. Turing was a mathematician, cryptanalyst and genius. Drawn to solving puzzles, of which the hardest was the Enigma which the Germans used to cipher their messages, he applied to the government department which aimed to crack the impossible Enigma. Being what was viewed as odd and even off- putting, he and his work in building the universal deciphering machine - what we now call the computer- is targeted by everybody.But what i expected to be tense and suspenseful as the biography of a man who struggled to decipher the Enigma code and win the war against Germany (which it was), also became something deep and personal. The character of Alan Turing was truly the heart of the movie; i began to care for the raw, sensitive character which Benedict Cumberbatch brought to life. Seemingly narcissistic but at the core a complex and lonely man (who also brought little instances of humour), he is truly one to fall for. Some characters were portrayed very shallowly - but that might ironically represent their personalities.The directing of the film was astounding. The interweaving of time periods in the life of Turing was surprisingly clean and intelligent. I always love woven narratives because i think that you gain a good sense of the character and their story; what has created them and shaped them, and this is a prime example.Having recently read up on a brief biography of Alan Turing, i am aware that the movie was in many ways factually inaccurate. However, as a great movie alone i still believe it deserves its high rating.If you are looking for a thought-provoking movie with the ability to resound with you, don't miss this one. Really. I have already decided to see it again in the cinema next week. There are so many things to love, and of course i cannot skip this quote: ""Sometimes it is the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Alan Turing Hero,"I have yet to see the new film ' The Imitation Game', but my admiration for Alan Turing goes back many years. I truly believe that his contribution to the winning of WWII in Europe was greater than that of any other single individual. I also believe that the way he was treated by the British Government, after the war, due to his being a homosexual, was absolutely disgraceful.I have recently read that there is now some question regarding his ' suicide'. Apparently he had some interest in deadly poisons and questions have arisen as to whether his death may have been accident. Of course that could provide a reasonable excuse to relieve the guilt that may be felt by the State for its appalling treatment of a true hero.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Good Acting, Good Direction, Good Movie","It's that time of year again. The time where I need to catch up with all the Oscar Nominees I have yet to see.I started with THE IMITATION GAME and am glad I did.This movie tells the true story of Alan Turing, the genius who helped to break the Enigma code by developing the first computer. He was a genius, socially inept, abrasive and...a homosexual. This ""condition"" was considered a crime in England at the time.Benedict Cumberbatch stars as Turing and is in almost every scene. Consequently, this movie will rise or fall on Cumberbatch's performance. I am happy to report that Cumberbatch more than rises to the occasion. This is, IMHO, his best acting job to date and that is saying something. Cumberbatch plays all the facets of Turing's character and develops a real person with all the good - and bad - included. His performance is one that should - and is - being recognized at award time.Abling assisting Cumberbatch is Keira Knightley, in her Academy Award nominated performance as his assistant, Joan Clarke. I've always liked Knightley as an actress and am happy to see her continued growth. Also included in this top notch cast are veteran British actors - Matthew Goode, Charles Dance and Mark Strong. They are more than able to spar with Cumberbatch.The story is told briskly by director Morten Tydlum and held my attention throughout.

An historical drama that falls into the usual traps,"It can't be stated enough: Alan Turing was (is!) a hero, and the way UK treated homosexuals back then was inhuman.And now on to the film: This is an important story that deserves to be told. The casting of Cumberbatch was perfect, as he manages to portray both the genius with social difficulties and the emotional, misunderstood outcast. The conflicting emotions in some of the scenes feels genuine, and he especially nails some of the more challenging scenes near the end.My problem with this film, however, is the (oscar winning) story. The people above Turing in the chain of command, like the character played by Charles Dance, are so one dimensional and villain-like that they completely pull you out of the movie's realism. There are other moments too (they are running of time! the police are circling in on him!) that feels exaggerated, due to this being a movie and all.

Tragic yet inspiring story of a man covering his own secrets while cracking more secrets,"The Imitation Game, based on the true story of Mathematics Genius Alan Turing, is captivating and excels on all accounts, making it a totally enjoyable movie experience and conducive to reflect on our own lives. It is the story of a man, while covering his own secret, spending all his life unlocking national secrets to save the lives of others who eventually put him in torture. His own life is an enigma. How ironic life is!Alan Turing is such a genius in mathematics and founder of the computing machine but also very awkward in social situations. He is absorbed in his own world, cracking codes since he was a teenager. He is also a philosopher with his own sets of logic – aware from a young age that people do not say what they mean but hope others will understand their symbols/codes. Being bullied at school and at work because he is different, Turing has developed tremendous resilience to resist violence while standing up for what he believes – breaking German codes and winning the war, even if that means sacrificing some people's lives.With a tightly knit script, the movie touches on three time zones – when Turing studies at a boarding school, when he works at the Bletchley Radio Factory and after the war when he teaches at university. The three periods are seamlessly intertwined and flows beautifully to highlight certain aspects of Turing which last/haunt all his life and make him unique. In a nutshell, he is a complicated person and we as audience also feel a mixture of feelings while watching his endeavor, whether professionally or personally. One easily feel really sorry and despaired, but at the same time inspired and encouraged.Benedict Cumberbatch is superb in portraying different levels of complexity in Turing's character. While others consider him arrogant and eccentric, we also see him as a single-minded, focused and smart person who just wants to break the codes and end the war. Although others consider him weird, it is exactly this quality that helps him build the decoding machine and save millions of lives by cutting the war short.Throughout the movie, there is a strong sense of suffering endured by Turing since he was a child, despite his genius in various aspects. It becomes more complicated when his sexual orientation causes him more threat. To makes his life even more intrigue, he is involved in decoding war secrets where no traces are allowed after the war. All these mysterious elements makes the film fascinating to watch.The support cast and sound track, as well as art direction, are excellent in depicting this unusual person in this extraordinary time. Alex Lawther, who plays young Turing, is magnificent with his limited screen time. His timid, sweet and shy smile, appreciative blinks as well as sad, repressed and determined denials make one's heart break. However, Keira Knightley is perhaps too attractive to playing Joan Clark, another mathematics expert who also feels like an outsider.History is ironic in a sense that we have to depend on someone abnormal to bring our lives back to normal. And yet society in general, at least back then, does not tolerant people who are seemingly different from the majority and tries to convert the outliers. However, determined, patient and focused, Turing has tremendous confidence in himself which others easily consider as narcissistic and egoistic. Perhaps one needs to do that as defense when one is so different. He probably did not realize his contribution to England as well as mankind when he was absorbed in his work. All he did was work hard in his own territory. Coincidentally Mencius the ancient Chinese philosopher says that ""If I believe in what I am doing, I will go ahead even if tens of thousands of people are against me."" I can see that in Turing. Although some people even consider Turing as a machine, judging from his deep affection for his childhood friend we can hardly call him a machine.From the real Mathematics prodigy Alan Turing to the award-winning screenwriter Graham Moore and Benedict Cumberbatch who acted out the character, we are blatantly told that it is OK to be weird and be different. All we need is to realize our potential and make good use of it. Someday, somehow, our efforts will be recognized. Perhaps if we keep it in mind, life is not that bad. Very inspirational and make you think outside the box. May we all be more open-minded coming out of this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Turing's later tragic circumstances are heartbreaking especially when it's revealed how it all ended for him.

So I'm pleasantly surprised that this was nothing like Iexpected.It's hard for me to pin down what made this a great movie for me considering my usual joys as noted above, and there was nothing clear to me that made it remarkable... but I suppose it was just a perfectly acted, perfectly balanced piece of historical drama.Of course the movie took liberties with the reality on occasion for the sake of the story, but those few calls were easily forgiven and the majority of less hypercritical viewers will not even think about it. I had already been in contact with Turing's legacy while I was studying AI as his Turing Test is used still today and the birth of the computer the all seeing eye and its negative repercussions, with its birthplace in the midst of war and the defeat of Hitler, sometimes referred to as an anti-Christ himself, all fascinated me.That's not to mention the stark difference in society at the time regarding homosexuality and how these were once prejudices enshrined in law and in the hands of regular people to enforce, and how the movie shows various relationships with pure subtlety and integrity.Intrigueing human tale that typithises our treatment of the different.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
I love this game!!,"""The Imitation Game"" is not a bio movie based on the life of infamous comedic impersonator Rich Little; even though that would have been a nifty little film. ""The Intimation Game"" however is a bio flick based on British Mathematician Alan Turing, who with his brilliant team of code-breakers at Britain's top-secret Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, tried to crack the Enigma Code to obtain German transmission during World War II; not an easy math problem, that's for sure! Unfortunately and unjustifiably, Turing was persecuted for his homosexuality which was illegal in Britain during that time. Director Morten Tyldum's breakthrough direction is one of the finest of the year. Tyldum is no dumb-dumb by putting us right in the middle of the codebreaking challenges & actions, while also masterfully presenting the complex humanistic persona of his protagonist, Alan Turing. Graham Moore also delivers solid write play on his fine screenplay delivery to ""The Imitation Game"". It is not an enigma that Benedict Cumberbatch's astounding performance as Turing broke the Academy code for a well-deserved Best Actor Oscar nomination. Keira Knightley does not completely imitate the grand performance of Cumberbatch, but the lovely Keira does shine with her supporting performance as Joan Clarke, the fellow mathematician who ends up engaged to Turing for non-conventational marital purposes. The much underrated Matthew Goode does good work once more as Hugh Alexander, who is part of Turing's dream team of codebreakers. So get on your game, and play ""The Imitation Game""; no code required, just an admission movie theatre ticket is what's needed. I loved this game!!!***** Excellent",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A movie that is driven by power packed performances.,"The Imitation Game is a biopic about mathematician, Alan Turing(Benedict Cumberbatch). During World War II, the British army led by Commander Denniston(Charles Dance) require Turing's help to crack the enigma code of the Nazis. Now, it is up to Alan Turing along with the help of fellow mathematicians, Joan Clarke(Keira Knightley), Hugh Alexander(Matthew Goode), John Cairncross(Allen Leech) & Peter Hilton(Matthew Beard) to crack the enigma code & end the war.The Imitation Game is an outstanding film. I'm really glad that the makers of the film decided to tell us this fascinating story. Alan Turing is truly an unsung hero. This movie deserves all the accolades & award nominations it has received. The performances are the highlight of the film. Benedict Cumberbatch has given the performance of a lifetime as Alan Turing. Cumberbatch's character is complex & goes through a roller-coaster of emotions throughout the film & Cumberbatch has portrayed Turing, flawlessly. Cumberbatch is so good that, in the last scene of the film, I teared up a little. Cumberbatch truly deserves his Oscar nomination. Keira Knightley is brilliant as Joan Clarke. Matthew Goode is outstanding as Hugh Alexander. Rory Kinnear is great as Detective Robert Nock. Allen Leach is good as John Cairncross. Matthew Beard is impressive as Peter Hilton. Charles Dance is excellent as Commander Denniston. Mark Strong is spectacular as Stewart Menzies. The Imitation Game is a must watch. Go for it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Philosopher Bethana Sullivan Reviews _The Imitation Game_,"Upfront let me say that Alan Turing exists in my memory bank in a minimalist way, meaning I know the broad outline of his story but not the details.I volunteered to attend the preview of the movie 'The Imitation Game' at the behest of Dan Mackay which led me to believe it must have some link or meaning or significance to the gay world, specifically to homosexual politics as lesbianism is an almost forgotten word in the story of gay politics.Much like the world at large right now, lesbian women have become more hidden and more silent: albeit to be fair, the stories of Reatheh and Jian are changing that for straight women at least. ...Read full review at http://wayves.ca/node/257",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Fine Movie; Distorted History,"Film-fan me loved ""The Imitation Game."" The me who knows something about World War II felt that ""The Imitation Game"" was a bit of an unfortunate farce.Aesthetically ""The Imitation Game"" is like a hundred other movies about British people dressed in attractive but muted woolens who march about speaking about God and country and occasionally dropping their civilized masks and giving play to their violence or their lust. We've seen all this before: the vintage clothing, the vintage cars, the vintage architecture, the golden lamplight on vintage interiors. We've seen it on Masterpiece Theater and Merchant Ivory and Jane Austen films and Downtown Abbey which I've never watched but which I feel as if I have watched.""The Imitation Game"" is also like a lot of bio pics.""The Imitation Game"" treats very complicated subject matter: the breaking of an unbreakable code. I wanted the movie to tell me something about this topic that I didn't already know. The film just puts an enigma machine on a table and has a bunch of smart characters stare at it and announce that it can produce one hundred fifty followed by eighteen zeroes variations. Okay, but how? Give me something technical. The movie never trusts its audience, or its own storytelling skills, enough even to scratch the surface of the nuts and bolts of code-breaking.Benedict Cumberbatch gives a fine performance as the film's version of Alan Turing, the British mathematician who helped to decode Germany's Enigma during WW II. In the film, Turing displays symptoms of Asperger's. He doesn't get jokes and he has few friends. Everyone is mean to him. He lives an isolated life with only one significant human companion, his school chum Christopher. Turing is awkward and superior with his fellow codebreakers, and they hate him. He is light years more advanced than they. If only they could appreciate his brilliance! Turing is regarded with suspicion by his superiors. They almost arrest him. They break into and search his home. Again, this all feels hackneyed.Enter Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley). Joan is a gifted code-breaker. Like Turing, she too faces difficulties because of others' ignorance and prejudice. People don't realize that a woman can be a worthy code- breaker and they keep her back and put her down.Joan encourages Turing to overcome his Asperger's symptoms and to befriend his coworkers. He does so.A casual comment by a secretary, that each German message ends with the words ""Heil Hitler,"" leads Turing to have the Aha moment that breaks Enigma. His jubilation is short-lived. He realizes that he can't rescue an English ship because if he does so, the Germans will realize that the English have broken their code. Turing devises a mathematical method to determine when to use information gathered from breaking the code, and when not to.Two other timelines are intertwined with the WW II timeline. We are shown Turing's schooldays. He interacts with Christopher, his schoolboy crush and only friend. Christopher departs from his life and Turing is heartbroken. The headmaster of the school is cold in breaking this news to young Turing. Poor little Turing must bear this hard news all by himself.In the other timeline, also interwoven randomly into the WW II timeline, Turing is interrogated in the early 1950s for ""gross indecency"" – homosexuality. Turing undergoes chemical castration. This affects his ability to think. He can't even do a simple crossword puzzle in the newspaper. He is a broken man. The film insists that his death was a suicide. Some, including Turing's mother, are not so sure of that.I was moved by the film. The scenes of little schoolboy Turing are very poignant; it's always hard to watch children suffer. Cumberbatch is a very competent actor and he plays intellectual intelligence well, which is a rare accomplishment. Not many actors could look as smart as Cumberbatch does. He is convincing as someone with Asperger's.The me who knows and cares something about accuracy in a film ""based on a true story"" about WW II was very disappointed with this movie.""The Imitation Game"" erases the significant contribution of Polish war heroes and Polish mathematicians to the breaking of Enigma. Like Turing, the Poles were also cruelly and ignominiously betrayed by the very Brits they helped: from Churchill consciously lying about who committed the Katyn massacre to Churchill handing the Poles to Stalin at Yalta to Brits like Stephen Fry insisting that Polish Catholics caused the Holocaust.It was ideologically convenient for Brits to shaft the Poles, and the Brits did exactly that. ""The Imitation Game"" erases the Poles because the film wants Turing to be a lone genius and a lone, martyred homosexual. As it happens, during WW II, there were plenty of opportunities for heroism and martyrdom; Turing did not monopolize the supply.Turing was treated kindly by the headmaster around the Christopher incident, and Turing remained in contact with Christopher's family. Turing proposed to Joan Clarke because he liked her – he even told her he loved her – not to keep her in the code-breaking program. He tried to re-start their relationship years later. Turing could be funny and charming in real life. Etc.The filmmakers wanted to create an image of Turing as an isolated genius, unappreciated by anyone, and persecuted because of his homosexuality. In fact Turing was part of a team of other geniuses, and he was open about being gay. I wish the film had been able to tell us more about how a relatively privileged man had been so ill-treated. His working class lover was not chemically castrated, for example. ""The Imitation Game,"" though, is not really interested in probing complex facts, or in saying anything new.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Another great endlessly effective mind.,The movie is good and the performance is charming by Benedict that you feel he broke another Enigma which was Alan's character. The music is very good written and added to the value of the scenes. However the direction was average and the story really didn't present that historical incident well and focused more in Alan's sexuality. Also it was predictable and had no worries watching it knowing that it will happen and they will break the Enigma code and that was the challenge to make you doubt that it will happen and present the suffering and work done to achieve it and focusing on it's result and on the war too and it's effect on it. The characters were very full of stories and feelings that could have been used instead of having unnecessary scenes and focusing on how to present the smartness of Alan's mind not telling us he is a smart and has a different attitude than others and you know that it will work in the end. Also small Alan was different than the big one that I felt the small one was performing another Alan with a mental disorder.Also Keira's character wasn't powerful or had any difficult scenes to present her well. However the movie is full of good scenes with performance and music and irresistible to watch.,7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Decent, but full of basic movie clichés and twists","The movie feels like a educational movie for a film making class 101. From the basic plot twists like:""He's fired, take him away!"" - ""No!""To the quotes that are repeated throughout the film at very predictable and cheesy moments:1. ""Sometimes it is the people who no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.""2. ""Do you know why people like violence? It is because it feels good. Humans find violence deeply satisfying. But remove the satisfaction, and the act becomes... hollow.""The performance of Cumberbatch ranges from alright to very strong at times, but his character seems like a mix of Sherlock and Sheldon Cooper from ""The Big Bang Theory"", including the same jokes about his social awkwardness. Then the film has 3 plot lines running in parallel with his school years, the world war and the ""present"" after the world war. The school storyline seems kind of bland and only serves one purpose in the end, which I won't spoil. The performance by the kid is also quite good, I actually liked him even more by Cumberbatch.So sure, if this is one of your first movies you ever saw as a grown up, it might be a good movie. But, it's surely won't be remembered in 10 years as a performance of a decade or anything. If I wouldn't be familiar with computer science I probably would give this movie a 7, but with the many inaccuracies regarding the technical aspects or the statements they make I can give him only a 6.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Calculated emotionless boredom,"I'm sorry to say this (or am I...!) but I think most of the people here who found this movie less than masterpiece have concentrated too much on ""historical inaccuracies"". They can be annoying of course, but in my opinion e.g. ""Mutiny On The Bounty"" (1935) or ""They Died With Their Boots On"" (1941) are the best and most entertaining b/w-movies ever made while what comes to historical facts being almost pure fiction from start to finish.My problem with this film is the same I have with nearly all British productions (despite a Norwegian director): every dramatic or humorous scene feels too predictable and calculated. How, frinstance, it is possible that these super-geniuses (along with their supervisors) can't understand the importance of keeping their successful code-breaking a secret from the enemy? And as if they wouldn't had discussed about the matter since the day one?On top of the above mentioned, and while Benedict Cumberbatch acts flawlessly, the main character's totally alienating obscurity and antisocial manners made me utterly uninterested about his endeavours. Not to mention his homosexuality which demolished all the excitement and affection of his relationship with Keira Knightley too. I just didn't care how he's gonna end up a slightest bit, and when this happens it obviously ruins movie experience like nothing else.

Breaking the Enigma and making computers at the same time.,"From a thrilling opening to a tearful ending The Imitation Game is a must. A different take on World War 2 history. Alan Turing is now a loner and independent nobody who must work against the odds,NAZI'sand allies to solve the unbreakable Enigma code that posed a threat to the Allies.A drift from true WW2 events surrounding the characters particularly Turing himself adds to the story and making it feel more ""up against the odds"" but some of the changes were unnecessary some which were a little cheesy to be honest but had a minimal affect on the film.The Imitation Game is paced incredibly well and shows a good portion of his homosexual lifestyle and his fight to keep it his secret so that he may be accepted as part of a homophobic society where punishment could include chemical castration.The opening sequence one of my personal favourites since The Shawshank Redemption sets up a thrilling WW2 masterpiece but this is more than just a war flick its a story of family, hope, struggle, struggle and acceptance that will ensure tearing up to many.Ratng: A+ Comment: A masterpiece for the ages.

Movies not just entertains you, it helps you learn, motivate and inspire. How many of us have heard about Alan Turing ? Thanks to the wonderful script and direction, The Imitation Game gives a utter truth behind the great personality.The Imitation Game tells the story of Alan Turing, the first person to create a computer with the help of which he cracks the enigma code during the World War II.From the director of Headhunters, Morten Tyldum gives you a story never heard and told before. You might have heard about the father of computer revolution- Steve Jobs but have you heard about Alan Turing ? He was a mathematician , ultra-marathon runner, scientist and inventor. It also shows the sad story of his later life and how he succumbs to it. The film is an upright entertainment right from the beginning. There is not a scene to loose with tight script and powerful acting. Art direction and cinematography adds to the charm making it more versatile. Full marks to Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley for pulling all the strings together. There is no doubt about who would have been the best person suited for the role of Alan Turing and with impeccable acting skills, Benedict Cumberbatch deserves a thumbs up.

A touching epic,"This film tells the life of Alan Turing, the mathematical genius who cracked the unbreakable code used by Nazi Germany in World War II.""The Imitation Game"" shows how socially inept Alan Turing is, and I think the script depicts this autistic aspect very well. The emergence of Joan in the film is such a gift, because she cares for Alan unconditionally, without asking for any return. I was deeply touched by her selfless sacrifice she offered Alan when Alan told her the secret. The thriller aspect of the film is very good too. The film successfully shows how there's so much at stake to crack the code, which seems impossible. The ending is so sad and moving. It's so sad that Alan Turing had to face such a horrible fate. To think that he died without any recognition of the tremendous achievement brings tears to my eyes. I really enjoyed watching it.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

History distorted for modern propaganda,"The portrayal of the cryptographic effort is fine enough, but the impression one gets from this overly-romanticised movie is that without Alan Turing's invention of what we are told was the precursor to the computer World War II would not have been won, and that his orientation was responsible for his genius, and therefore both must be held high. That is historical bunkum. The truth is that the machine he invented, which was called the Bombe, was an electromechanical device that was created to crack the Enigma codes, which indeed it did, but the far more complicated Lorenz codes were cracked by Colossus, which really was an electronic computer, and was far superior to the Bombes, and it was it that was the true precursor to the modern computer, It was invented by Tommy Flowers, whose genius surpassed that of Alan Turing, because he managed it without access to an actual Lorenz machine, unlike Turing who was provided with an Enigma machine. Flowers just worked out how the Lorenz worked from a 4000- character mistake made by a German operator. Enter 'bombe and Colossus' into Google and read the Wikipedia article to get the facts straight. Turing had some input into the Colossus machine (ultimately there were ten of them at Bletchley), but to pretend that he was all-important in the winning of the war is an overwrought notion of events wilfully twisted to make a point consistent with fashionable present-day propaganda. We would have won the war without Turing; with most of the world against him Hitler's over-reached lusts were unsustainable; and there were other people of genius. Victory might have taken longer and killed many fewer people, although we cannot know that for sure despite the claim made in this film , but there were many clever minds and strategies from many people that gave the Allies victory (the invention of radar, is one of many examples). If any one person at Bletchley is to be singled out above all others it should be Tommy Flowers, not Alan Turing. Turing was a genius and valuable, yes, but Flowers surpassed him. But Hollywood cannot make out of him a politically-correct song-and-dance-act to the tune of current ephemeral memes.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
159 Million With 18 Zeros,"You always think of war heroes as the ones who fight with guns and tanks. They even had a holiday named after them. But truly the word hero is much broader than that. There are so many heroes that go unnoticed for years until there is a movie made about them. I really had no idea the type of effort that people went through in order to crack the unbreakable code. Benedict Cumberbatch gives an extraordinary performance as, Alan Turing, the leader of the mathematicians who absolutely changed the war for the better.Cumberbatch is a revelation as Turing. We all know he is capable of grabbing our attention in whatever role he's in, but I did question his ability to lead an entire Oscar bait film. Well, I think that question can be put to rest. There is so much range to his performance that will surely make him a great Doctor Strange. But the supporting cast is also terrific. Charles Dance brought an undeniable presence to one of Turing's bosses. Matthew Goode won me over, as I was never a huge fan of his. But Keira Knightley gave what was probably her best performance of her career. It takes two charismatic leads to tackle the roles of Alan and Joan. These people were unbelievably intelligent, but I also appreciate the film touching on some of their flaws.I had no idea the amount of odds that were stacked up against them to crack the enigma code. The film said that it's worth 20 million years worth of data settings, and they have to crack it in 20 minutes. They only had a certain amount of time before the Germans would change the code and then all of their work goes to waste. Not only do they have to be intelligent but they have to be mentally stable under these pressures. I guess it really is the people you don't imagine doing the unimaginable things. I may have botched that quote, but the premise is the same.Alexandre Desplat had a terrific score, that is probably the only score this year that I wouldn't argue winning over Interstellar. I'm still humming the beautiful theme hours later. It contributed to the heartbreaking reality that was illegal to be homosexual during this time. Much like Selma, this film opened my eyes to the unimaginable things that humans did, and are capable of. I cant believe that he was given drugs in order to treat his ""illness"". The only real problem with the movie is that tries to give several special effects scenes that are a little too ambitious for a lower budget film. But Alan Turing is one of the true heroes of the war and saved over 14 million lives and shortened the war over 2 years.

Smart storytelling for a compelling story,"It took me a couple days after watching the film to start writing this review. I didn't know why it took me so long but since I generally don't rush these things it didn't worry me. Writing a review I always try to be original, use my own words, share my own opinion, and try to make memorable with a couple of paragraphs. The Imitation Game is an interesting film with a great cast and brilliant performances but I'll get into that later.Watching the film the narrative jumped out at me and I couldn't pin point why. It starts off with the declaration of war and progressively goes back and forth from 1945 to the 1950s with little flashbacks on Alan Turing's boyhood peppering the narrative. No matter the time periods the constant in all this is Turing, it is his story after all. I guess, I didn't understand why the story was told that way. I mean it's a compelling story, so to me the flash- forwards to the 1950s - his post WWII life - are almost obsolete. The boyhood aspect of the flashbacks were important and interesting because they helped understand how complex Alan Turing was and gave him depth, as for the flash-forwards I had no clue.Of course, the movie would have felt a bit boring without the flash- forwards but it wouldn't have hurt it. Then it occurred to me that without them the British Government looks seriously bad. The man saved 14 Millions of lives - like they've reminded us in the film - but they still prosecuted him for consensual homosexual sex, sorry I meant ""public indecency"". I am baffled by this, I am no LGBT activist but injustice still rattles me. Maybe more so because if this war Hero's ""kink"" was little girls, I get the sense that he, somehow, would have eluded prosecution. And that investigator, who looks consumed by shame and guilt, once he realized what he's done, does not shake my belief that things would have gone differently for Turing if it was anything other than homosexuality. I may have gotten too far with this but you get my point.As for the movie, it has all the cultural aspects of this era, by which I mean misogyny and homophobia, no seriously it's also funny, riddled with humor like most British movies are and it is because of Cumberbatch's portrayal of Turing. The loner, introverted, socially awkward genius makes for comedy gold. Turing's interactions with people around him and their reactions to his ""uniqueness"" made me laugh throughout the film. This might sound like Sherlock, also brilliantly portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch, but I did not once felt like he was playing the same character although, I'll admit that the two are alike. Which brings me to the immense talent that Cumberbatch showed in The Imitation Game, he not only portrayed a similar character to the one that internationally brought him to stardom but he did it with enough flair and finesse to give Alan Turing a voice and singularity.Unlike some biopic about great men, the supporting cast in The Imitation Game was strong and memorable, they all had their moments that gave them layers and also elevated the film. Among those people, is Keira Knightley, on who I had lost hope a long time ago, she showed skills and cunning in this movie for a character that easily could have felt flat and forgettable. She's borderline fag hag but with a good script and some acting skills she did well. The same skills - why do I feel like it's an insult to them? - are shown by the talented Charles Dance, Matthew Goode, Mark Strong, Allen Leech, Matthew Beard & of course Alex Lawther.Morten Tyldum delivered a culturally relevant, fun dramatic film. This man knows how to get you emotionally involved and takes you smoothly through one of the great injustice of our time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Imitation of Life,"The Imitation Game follows in a recent tradition of both British-based historical dramas intended to invoke sympathy and knowledge about incidents or individuals previously unknown or under-appreciated to the general public. Like The King's Speech, The Iron Lady or The Theory of Everything, it has gained much critical acclaim, but it also leaves one feeling rather empty at the end of it all; you sit there and ask ""Is that all they can invoke in us?"" In the case of Alan Turing, portrayed here as a most eccentric mathematical genius attempting to crack impossible German military codes during World War II, there seems to be more emphasis on him and his hang-ups rather than his work. Of course, there are scenes discussing his attempts to fund and build an enormous electromechanical device capable of searching through innumerable possibilities of coded words in order to deduce what was more likely being used and what could be discarded. Thus, the possible codes are highlighted, allowing the Allies to use such information against the enemy.If this sounds somewhat technical, that is because much of the dialogue here is filled with cryptological jargon, a language only understandable to those involved with such activities or otherwise interested in the usage of code-breaking as a tool to win the war. Such an idea is understandable and relatable, yet the film utilizes it only as a plot device, nothing more. Perhaps this is because the filmmakers felt too much technical language would turn audiences off, but it seems more likely they simply underestimate those interested in Turing's accomplishments. The man himself is reduced to another recent pattern of so many films: the antisocial yet brilliant genius capable of winning over adversaries through his work despite any effort to relate to others on a strictly human level. In some ways, this pattern exposes studios' belief in audiences wanting to see people who they believe are a type of ubermenschen, super-beings capable of thinking and acting beyond our middling, common understanding.This is certainly how Turing is portrayed here, despite Benedict Cumberbatch throwing himself completely into the role. As affable an actor as in work today, Cumberbatch nevertheless gets caught up in Turing's supposed speech handicaps and nervous ticks without using them to explore the darker aspects of Turing's personality. His homosexuality, made such an issue in the trailers and advertisement of the picture, was in fact simply another aspect of his life he attempted to privatize only for it to become his undoing. Any connection between his attraction to men and his attraction to complex puzzles seems rather stretching, although the film makes attempts to do so. In particular, the name of Turing's ground-breaking machine which is used to break German codes is 'Christopher,' who is shown in flashbacks to be a boyhood crush from school and died when Turing was still young. Such a fabrication only exposes the film's desire to create something that never was; this movie has its own impossible codes that remain just that.Despite all this, Cumberbatch is capable of creating enormous sympathy for this rather cold, unfeeling man who nevertheless somehow (through plot contrivance) manages to surround himself with die-hard supporters, including the brilliant Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley) who Turing proposes to though it seems he may be attracted to her in some way. Again, this is merely used for plot extension, and despite there being no disrespect towards Clarke as a woman capable of holding her own against the male-dominated cryptography section at Bletchley Park, it causes one to question just what was the true nature of this peculiar yet symbiotic relationship. The movie never bothers to answer.Perhaps, the questions not answered cannot be. Much of Turing's work was hidden by the British government until a few years ago due to its highly-classified nature, which only underlines just how far-reaching his ideas became. The movie ends with several title cards telling us what became of Turing; the final one saying that 'Turing machines' are known better today as computers. Whatever truth this statement holds still allows us little access to understanding just what exactly motivated Turing in his work. In this film, he does it simply because he is good at it and he seems unqualified for any other work. Such a simplification is hardly ever the truth, and indeed there are many other aspects of the film which have come under fire for either emphasizing the unimportant or otherwise completely misappropriating various facts to the wrong individuals. Specifically, Turing was not as autistic or antisocial as this film leads us to believe, which only goes to show how certain aspects of one's life often become the true motivation to make a film about someone and their achievements. It's not enough that Turing accomplished so much; he has to have done it through personal shortcomings which otherwise would have caused one of us 'normal' people to falter. How can we, then, sympathize with an ubermensch?",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A movie that both teaches and entertains,"Plain and simple The Initiation Game is a movie that needs to be watched, not only is it superbly acted and keeps you interested all the way through it tells a story so few really know about, myself included.I came out of the theatre with a deep appreciation for a type of movie that is being made less and less, one that doesn't rely on special effects and mass amounts of blood and gore ( don't get me wrong I do like those movies as well).This movie truly relied on a fantastic script and superb acting nothing more and the results are memorable. My gauge for how much I like a movie is would I watch it again and my answer for this movie is a emphatic yes.Birdman won the Oscar for best picture over this, I can't believe it but then again that is just my opinion. My advice to Hollywood is to stop looking in on yourself so much and take the blinders off, there are so many interesting stories out there that need to be told and all you do is re-hash the same old same old.

Politics, intrigue and the complexity of fitting within the geopolitical world of war. It also make a more subtle point that the real reason the Allies won the war was that they knew the German play book.

About cryptology,I always enjoy movies more when they are based on real life events. And this one certainly falls into that category. Following all the steps the code breakers had to do to crack the enigma code was pleasant to watch. They are the inventors of our actual computers. Without them I would probably not be typing this right now. Thanks to Alan Turing (played beautifully by Benedict Cumberbatch) and his team science took a big leap. Maybe the story is not 100% accurate about all the cryptologists it still remains a good movie to watch. All the actors gave good performances and the storyline was easy to follow. I can't imagine that anyone would not be entertained with this movie.,8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"""The Imitation Game"" trumps its rival","""The Imitation Game"" and ""The Theory of Everything"" are two uncannily similar movies. They both tell astonishing tales of genius scientists, their monumental achievements and equally monumental hardships. They both feature excellent lead actors who give career-defining, Oscar-worthy performances. However, in almost every aspect, ""The Imitation Game"" is just slightly better.Cumberbatch completely disappears into the role of Alan Turing, a genius mathematician who shortened World War II by two years by cracking the Germans' Enigma code along with a team of scientists. It would have been easy, and cliché, to spend a large amount of time on Turing's struggle with homosexuality, for which he was convicted in the early 1950s. But one of the biggest virtues of ""The Imitation Game"" is that it portrays Turing's attitude to his sexuality exactly as it was: he never struggled with it, he simply accepted it for what it was. He was wholly devoted to his cause, and anything which stood in his way he would remove, to the point of marrying his team's only female member despite his homosexuality, because her parents would otherwise have ordered her to return to them.Because the movie is a biopic, it is inherently flawed. The reasons for this are that biopics tend to focus so much on the acting and the story that they neglect such things as soundtrack, cinematography, and script. These things are usually rushed and therefore imperfect. However, as biopics go, this is a good one.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Motivational, Realistic, Liberal, & Extraordinary","The Imitation Game movies is a long journey of breaking the encoded messages by using Enigma, which is a machine used by the Germans, to encrypt the secret messages. It was developed in the end of the World War I; later on the Germans used it in the World War II. To me, the movie is not about showing the negative use of the technology; instead, it evaluates the appropriate level of such an enormous technology. Besides, the movie gives a brief overview on the outstanding works and unbelievable achievements of Alan Turing, who can be termed as father of computer too, because his exceptional thinking of providing ability to machines to think like humans, might has given birth to the idea of computer, partially. Honestly, I am not the one who can judge every movie, but this movie is really an exceptional piece. It plays a vital role in introducing technology, pain, happiness, fear, craziness, conspiracy, realism, burning desire, and enthusiasm. Whatever it was, the movie just enhanced my perception about several things that happen in daily life. Eventually, if you have a burning desire, then you can achieve anything whether it decoding Enigma or inventing its competitor.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

"Reducing the actual Alan Turing to a bumbling social failure, to garner viewer empathy","Not particularly true to original events nor true to Alan Turing Character. Farcical but big budget movie with excellent actors make it for a great viewing nonetheless. Reducing the actual Alan Turing to a bumbling social failure, to garner viewer empathy was a main theme of movie, but actual truth Turing was a charmer and socially apt personality.Where the movie shines is showing Turing for his concept of coming up with a thinking machine, or Machine intelligence. A machine that can be re programmed. This later develops into what is know as the Computer. In the digital age it was renamed Artificial intelligence. The unsung hero of science and WWII finally finds the spotlight in global cinema, albeit in the form of a sobering social miscreant. Nor does it end their, the movie failed to show the social class and woman status correctly. Turing developed the machine and outline it theoretically the machine was build by mechanics not Turing himself because it was deemed of lower status to meddle with mechanics and get your hands dirty, the upper class social norm of the time in England. The machines was run and maintained by the woman, and it gave out a lot of heat.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Captivating!,"Where do i begin. if you told me what this movie was about id would pass it over in a second. it sounds very boring. Watch 10 minutes and you are hooked.lets start off with the cast. Bededict Camberbatch has been a favourite of mine since he become popular in America with star trek into darkness. In this movie hes basically Dr Sheldon Cooper: a self proclaimed genius who condescends and pisses everyone off. Another great addition to the cast are Charles dance aka Tywin Lannister from game of thrones; one of the few television dramatic series ever made that is worth watching. icing on the cake was that moment when Mathew Goode graced the screen. the first time I've seen him in since he portrayed Adrien Veight in the best movie of all time ""watchmen"".the main story is the nerds at study but there are some bitching ww2 war scenes thrown in so we don't doze. I was hoping for no annoying romantic interest to ruin the movie then in walks Keira Knightly, shes hotter than a microwave so we let her stay. the scenes with Tywin and Kahn are the best they really play off each other well. mark strong was great too. the code breaking theme, the cold war music and the drab 40s clothing really remind me of ""a beautiful mind"" but in a good way.maybe not a film you will watch over and over but its cute and worth a go.good game",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Misleading,"I enjoyed this movie, but was disturbed by all the inaccuracies. Turing was always upfront about his sexual preferences. His teenage relationship with Christopher was never as intense as portrayed, and he learned of his friend's death along with the other boys. All the stuff about the name of his enigma breaking machine, his interaction with his temporary fiancée, and most of his time with the enigma team was mistaken. Especially annoying was the nonsense about being suspected of treason. What an insult, that this British hero was ever accused of being a spy. Finally, notice how cavalier the screenwriters were about his pardon. Pardoned for what? Being gay? His conviction and that of many, many others should have been expunged. Nonetheless the lead actor is superb in the role, and the story is engaging, so I'll give it a lukewarm pass.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Excellent Movie - Life & Death Depending on Intellect vs,Societies Ignorance's Endangering Freedom from Tyranny","Excellent Movie - Ignore the Few Bad Review's!One star ratings are from our lovely ""Foaming at The Mouth - Agenda Driven - Radical Right Wing - Evangelicals"" who hate anything that has a gay person in it; much less exposing how horribly ignorant society was towards women as well. They still are deluded into thinking the 50's was all a ""Leave It To Beaver"" paradise for all in society as they forget the atrocities to blacks, Italian's, gays, women, Jew's, disabled, Latinos (sure I missed many more who were abused by such mindsets they espouse then and even this day). As well the poverty and the openly embracing of hate and many more ignorance's that they clinch still to this day to. If they were not so dangerous and holding society back I would pity them, alas they are as big a threat as any fanatic is regardless of who or what they believe. So one star people keep your bigoted hate in your place of worship and in your petty party politics of control devising ways to abuse others you so endeavor so hard; we are moving forward with or without you in the USA.Movie has a solid cast of characters with great cinematography and well balanced story that keeps you interested in the film and its characters as it takes back to the WWII era in England and see the underlying efforts to win the war and unlikely people behind the scenes that made such happen.The movie was excellent in showing the bravery of unsung hero's and how the war was won through brains and how many went unnoted and even suffered scorn by those ignorant to their true selfless actions for the war effort. How our ignorance could of and likely cost us more death than was necessary because we judged by superficial bigoted means and not by character and persons abilities.Movie pointed out indirectly how even then, women were still seen as property with little say in their lives if they were to be of virtue and have any hope of social status. How that even in adulthood that they must blindly obey thy parents or have a husband to answer to and permiss them their very activities. How pre and during WWII women were limited career wise; regardless of talents and education. That is unless they were able to lie and deceive the gatekeepers of who could and could not succeed and prosper on their own merits; regardless of gender, skin color and sexual orientation.We also see how allowing society to sub-come to ignorant views and bigoted perceptions not only can destroy innocent people; but how such leaves upon society so many potential needless loss of life because such ignorance cost them the talent and skills another had to offer humanity. I wonder how much we have lost unknowingly do to the ignorant and bigoted people who demand and self proclaim they know what is best for everyone including others they know not and who preach freedom as long as the freedom is their liking and under their control.Movie has a great direct story and many underlying life lessons some to this day still refuse to accept and wish to drag society back into there 1st century thinking's!

Or maybe a comparison to the Sherlock Holmes movies by Guy Ritchie would be closer, just without the action.

Beautiful story and completely engaging - tho rushed and seemingly dramatized at end,"The Imitation Game is everything you would expect from The Weinsteing Company: a beautiful film of a story from a distinct viewpoint with stellar performances by its actors.The Imitation Game is a film about the little known story of brilliant mathematician and logician Alan Turing during the Second World War.World War II is heavily underway and the British forces lay siege against the German military. Lives are being lost and there is no end in sight for the war. British secret intelligence hope to decrypt encoded communications from Nazi led Germany in order to gain leverage in the war. The code they use, the enigma code, is unbreakable. One needs to know the precise settings to read the encrypted messages and they change every day at 6am – with 159million-million-million potential enigma settings each morning.The Royal British Army decides to hire cryptographers, mathematicians and logicians straight from university in the hopes that their superior intellect could beat enigma. Alan Turing, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, is among those and the prodigious mathematician leads the fervent effort against the unbreakable enigma.As a film, The Imitation Game is remarkable, beautiful and poignant. The plot is harmoniously multifaceted, simultaneously telling the story of young Turing, the war efforts against the Germans and enigma, and the tragic conclusion to Turing's tale. The inherent cohesion within The Imitation Game is solely thanks to director Morten Tyldum. It is only with a clear vision that so many unique vantage points of one man's life could converge into this miraculous narrative. Further, Tyldum's film progresses at a fast pace to capture the viewer's engagement and attention despite the dense intellectual subject material. This effect is facilitated by a captivating score by Alexandre Desplat.The character role of Turing we find in Cumberbatch is not a new portrayal for the actor but it is the most delicate of his career. Cumberbatch brings the potentially off-putting personality of a genius with a superior aptitude for his craft and couples it with the social awkwardness of an emotionally strained man and levels it off at a less antagonistic and more endearingly realistic man.The Weinstein Company's The Imitation Game is just what you would expect from an Academy Award nominated film. It is breathtaking to watch but there are some points of improvement. The narrative seems unnecessarily dramatized and historically inaccurate, especially in regard to the double agent espionage subplot involving Turing.Further, the conclusion as a whole seems a bit rushed.

"Great Hollywood fashioned important story, but mixed emotions","Great story well played out in Hollywood fashion. Beautifully made and well acted - worth a few awards I'm sure, but didn't quite live up to the billing I'm afraid. I think maybe the Hollywood treatment didn't jive with the meek, uncomfortable, genius of Turing (expertly portrayed by Cumberbatch).I'd seen an earlier, much lower budget movie about Turing called Codebreaker over a year ago. Plus I had heard a little about Turing, the Enigma code and had been carrying a story of my own relating to the consequences of the code breaking for many years.How important was Turing ? Some have claimed his part in the real story is overstated. But to me, I feel he could be very important. My education, my career and now my centre of expertise directly relate to his work. But, also perhaps my life, my family and my homeland.I don't feel people still quite understand what Turing and others managed to do, how creative he/they were and what we take for granted today in many facets of life, we potentially owe to him and his contemporaries.But I'm still bothered by the fact the he never enjoyed the attention, praise and love he deserved. It is shocking how recent this inhumane law existed. What joy would he have today to see the power of what is at our fingertips.My reaction wasn't one of inspiration, but one more of sadness. I felt rather lonely walking home.I did read a number of reviews on IMDb and adjusted this review slightly to take into consideration that the code breaking was in reality not just the creation of Alan Turing, but a number of brilliant men and women who worked behind the scenes.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

I believed the producers were trying to point out the fact that being difference is what matters. Ordinary things is boring and wont bring any changes.Benedict did a fine job as Alan, from being a curious over the head thinker (like he always does in Sherlock) to an insecure man. Oh! The young Alan did a great job especially that scene where he tries to hide his tears upon receiving the sad news about Christopher form the headmaster. All the characters were well played and the scenery of the movie is spot on specifically for the WW period.What's more striking about the movie is the indication of the way homosexuals are being treated back then.

Good but it could have been much better,"This film is based on the life of Alan Turing (played by Benedict Cumberbatch), an Englishman who headed a team that decrypted the Nazis' Enigma code during World War II. Through flashback and flash-forward, three time periods are exposed: Turing's childhood in a boarding school in the 1920s, the war period, and his post-war life beginning in 1951 after he had been convicted for being sexually involved with another man.""The Imitation Game"" is successful in recreating time periods long gone. The middle war-time section is the one that is given the most time and it is rightfully filled with excitement. After reading Wikipedia's comments on the film, however, it seems that many liberties were taken to embellish the historical truth for dramatic purposes. While this works most of the time in film, it is questionable in this case - not only for the large number of changes but also because at least one posthumous reputation has been harmed.I believe the film would have been more effective with a different time structure. The rare early flashbacks were perfect and complete. Young actor Alex Lawther (young Turing) is very powerful in a scene in which he is given bad news while his face shows how well trained he already is in upholding a stiff upper lip.I believe that the other two sections should have been linear and included the time period between them. It would have been intriguing to see the transition from post-war glory to adjusting to regular life as well as the terrible times during and after Turing's conviction. This last section included a very moving scene that was well acted between Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley who played Joan Clarke, the lone female on the team of cryptanalysts (whose story might also make a fine film).Sadly, this last period of the film had such a limited time, it felt more like an extended footnote. It deserved more emphasis. There might have been more genuine drama if the middle section had less embellishments and the later section exposed more of the real drama - the heartbreaking irony that a national (and international) hero was prosecuted by a cruel law unfairly relating to private conduct.Cumberbatch's best acting is in this last section. In the middle portion, he does a fine job as someone who is work-obsessed and emotionally withdrawn but this later section clearly shows a man who is broken and heavily medicated. There is also little evidence in the movie that show's Turing's homosexuality aside from various comments. In exposing more of the post-war period, Cumberbatch's performance would have been elevated from one that is very good to one that would have been outstanding.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

"If you've never heard of Alan Turing, this is the film for you","Version I saw: UK cinema releaseActors: 7/10Plot/script: 7/10Photography/visual style: 7/10Music/score: 6/10Overall: 7/10I came into 'The Imitation Game' knowing quite a bit about Alan Turing. He comes into conversations about science, mathematics, history and civil rights. I had seen the 1996 BBC drama 'Breaking the Code' starring Derek Jacobi, as had Benedict Cumberbatch, who has said in interviews that Jacobi's performance of the role influenced his own. For this version though, the focus is more on the effects of Turing's autism on his life than of his speech impediment.This is Cumberbatch's forte: characters who are right all the time, about everything, but communicate poorly. He's got the charisma to be likable even while behaving (on the face of it) badly toward people. In fact, he heads a cast featuring Mark Strong, Keira Knightley and Charles Dance, all doing the exact types of performances at which they excel.Turning this kind of story into a drama faces an obstacle that doing maths and breaking codes in rooms is not inherently cinematic, but the screenplay does a good job of getting around this by various means. Graham Moore's script is excellent in many regards. Also, I would like to point out some great location scouting and set dressing.My only hesitation is that... Maybe I am wrong, but I don't think The Imitation Game adds much to the knowledge of even a fairly educated layman. There's very little new information here, and some questions I had remained unanswered. It covers the basics in an engaging, dramatic, insightful way, but if you are coming to this to expand your knowledge of Turing, you might want to look elsewhere instead.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

history,"In a letter to Georgi Parvanov, President of Microsoft Bill Gates officially recognized the merits of John Atanasov for the opening of the first computer and its role in development of the information society. The letter was delivered to the Bulgarian head of state vice president Pete Hayes, sent by the head of Microsoft's celebrations of the 100th anniversary of the birth of John Atanasov.After experiments with various available at this time calculating devices Atanasov first introduced the concept of ""analog computer"". In 1936, together with Glenn Murphy colleague atomic physicist, create a small analog calculator for study of the geometry of surfaces, which they call ""Laplasiometar"". Atanasoff found that it has the same shortcomings as all other analog devices - accuracy depends on the work of other parts of the machine.

It should be built on the basis of electronic elements to consider with binary numbers instead of decimal worn long and there is a separate from the CPU memory that is regenerative (with capacitors) [2]. Furthermore physicist and mathematician Atanasov is a highly qualified expert in electronic equipment, which helps to design specific circuit solutions. To build the machine Atanasov need technical assistance, which shares with his friend Harold Anderson, also a professor of physics in college. His latest recommended one of his best students - Clifford Berry (Clifford E. Berry, 1918-1963).In March 1939 the University awarded him $ 650 and Atanasoff and Berry began working as the installation of the machine is carried out in the basement of the physics lab. For a few months they create and refine a prototype of a computing machine, later called the Atanasoff-Berry computer or ABC (English: Atanasoff-Berry Computer). Atanasov plans to record in memory and automatically, a series of commands in the process of calculation, т.е. use software [2].In December 1940 Atanasov first met John Mauchly at the conference and expressed his interest due to the machine and its working principle Mauchly invited guests in Ames.

"Decent film, poor movie-making practice. Waste of source material.","Should you watch, is the question.I say; if you've never heard of ""Turing"" or the ""Enigma machine"", have little to no interest in the source material, rather are just out for a Hollywood tale of olds with a lime and ginger twist - this film simply, as a previous reviewer so eloquently put, ""Ticks all the boxes"". That being said, though well crafted, the film shies away from its underlying historical events in favor of some very generic Hollywood storytelling.To be clear, I'm not at all referring to historical inaccuracies prominent throughout. I'm quite OK with those. But rather that in its adaptation, naturally occurring insights inherent to the historical events were thoroughly overwritten. A tale of intellectual pursuits, dedication, hard work and cooperation was replaced with yet another tale of exceptionalism. Not to say Turing was not exceptional, rather, that since his true virtues could not be easily dramatized, any and all facts were blundered into a chaos that is somewhat irrespective of the real events and people.Though in itself a decent movie, in its disloyal depiction of historical events the film fails to respect its source material, and would have perhaps more appropriately been labeled fiction inspired by real events (much like Song of ice and fire, to name an example).",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Exploring an Enigma,"Norwegian director Morten Tyldum's English-language debut ""The Imitation Game"" is the type of movie that seems custom built for awards recognition. This classy historical drama explores the life and contributions of a man whose impact would not be acknowledged until many years after his tragic & untimely death. That man was Alan Turing, a mathematician who played a key role in breaking Germany's ""Enigma"" code during World War II.The screenplay is loosely based on a biography of Turing and, from what I understand, it isn't shy about bending the truth for dramatic effect. Personally, I don't find this to be a problem because the story is compellingly told and none of the fabrications or exaggerations strike me as being unreasonable in the name of entertainment. If you're only interested in stringent historical accuracy then you probably shouldn't be watching movies to begin with. That being said, for what it's worth, the screenplay was rewarded with an Oscar, which was surprisingly the only major award that the film received.The cast is comprised of a fine group of British thespians, with Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead role. Cumberbatch is always good but this might be his best performance to date. Also notable was Keira Knightley in an Oscar-nominated supporting role. The rest of the cast is a model of professionalism and features the likes of Mark Strong, Matthew Goode & Charles Dance.From a production standpoint, the movie does an excellent job of recreating its period setting, from sets to costuming. Morten Tyldum's direction is nicely handled and the movie also sports a score from Alexandre Desplat (one of two Oscar-nominated scores from Desplat in that particular year). Overall, certainly a prestige picture whose individual components all show considerable care and attention.Although ""Birdman"" & ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" hogged most of the awards recognition for 2014, I think that ""The Imitation Game"" is right up there with them. Sure, it may play fast and loose with the facts but it sheds light on an important subject, all the while giving us a fresh perspective on World War II. I certainly don't have any reservations in recommending it, though you've been warned about what I feel are justified liberties taken with the truth for dramatic effect.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Not bad but leaves out,"The film maker really wanted to make a film decrying poor treatment of homosexuals but had to get the good stuff in about the incredible contribution Turing made to the war effort and his brilliant, kooky, iconoclastic mind. But he began with the 1951 investigation into his homosexuality and then drifted back into the war, came back again to the investigation, finally went back to the great war intrigue story of him breaking the Enigma code against all odds, but kept going forward to the darn police investigating his sexuality as if it mattered to the breaking of the code...which it didn't. Finally, before the true code story was finished -- namely how he helped them ingeniously use the information from the code breaking to help the war effort without tipping off the Nazi's that they'd broken the code is simply stated as an afterthought. He had a huge part in that and it was dropped so we had to go back to the police investigation that eventually led to his needless torment and his sad suicide (which also was referenced). Could have been a great movie. Wasn't. Too bad the film makers agenda got in the way of his story telling.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A brilliant film about a brilliant mind.,"This film is based on the life of Alan Turing, the father of the modern computer. He is a truly remarkable character, responsible for the era of technology in which we live and one of the most brilliant people of the 20th century. This film focuses mainly on Turing's effort, during the Second World War, to decipher the secret codes of German military communications, hitherto undecipherable. The film, however, also addresses the issue surrounding Turing's homosexuality.As it was a period film based on a book, I was already expecting some mishaps to the true story, and it was unsurprisingly that I read some reviews where it was mentioned. But I am not the best person to evaluate this because I do not know the figure of Alan Turing in detail, nor did I dedicate myself to read that book to see if it shares the same flaws. But yes, I admit such possibilities and, given that it is a period film based on a true story, this is something that I personally penalize. I am one of those people who understand that, in these cases, freedom of creation must be well demarcated. Another thing I would like to understand better is whether the book, like the film, takes Turing's suicide for granted, since there were serious doubts about it at the time. Aside from these reservations, I had no major problems with the script that, without giving too much detail, sweeps the scientist's life very close to death, making use of the flashback to visit and present situations from the past.Morten Tyldum ensures effective and competent management. He is a director I didn't know yet and who has been circulating more on television, but he did a good job. Benedict Cumberbatch, whom I only remembered seeing play secondary roles and the villain of ""Star Trek Into Darkness"", had his opportunity to show value and did not disappoint. He was devastating in the main role, complex and psychologically challenging character. The work paid off well, and although I haven't seen many of the films he came in after this one, seeing his filmography here on the website is enough to see how much his career has benefited and grown. Next to her is Keira Knightley, a veteran of period films, with an already solid career. Rory Kinnear, Matthew Goode and Charles Dance also did a good job.Technically, there is little to say about this film. The filming and photography work was well done but the exquisite editing and post-production effort, with all those flashbacks, stands out particularly. The soundtrack, by Alexandre Desplat, is to be congratulated and remains a little in the ear after the film ends. The sets and costumes are excellent and I think they are faithful enough to the period portrayed.Oscar winner (Best Adapted Screenplay) was nominated for Best Film, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, Best Edition, Best Soundtrack and Best Production Design. Not being a perfect film, I think it was relatively close to that.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

The Imitation Game weighs the perfect balance between personal and professional life.,"Watched this movie nothing short of 3 times now. It screams excellence from the story-telling, to the narrative set at hand, and even the acting. Although the movie is a little older now and the age does show, this movie is how you tell an Alan Turing story.Starting at what I believe is the most impressive aspect of the movie, the acting. I believe Benedict Cumberbatch's acting of portraying a socially undeveloped and neurodivergent Alan Turing as beautiful. From the physical twitches to the fringe and tense voice, it doesn't sell short.The supporting cast around Benedict Cumberbatch wasn't awful either. The co-stars, Matthew Goode and Keira Knightley do their job and really bring out the performance in each other. Matthew Goode has the natural swagger of Hugh Alexander, while Keira Knightley portrays a sense of non-belonging as a woman of science in the 40s.The narrative set at hand is rather dull at first glance. It's a story about scientists - and the movie doesn't sell anything more than that. They aren't in an active war zone, and you won't see fighting as other movies may portray. But they build their own suspense worthy of even the best action movies. The race against time, multiple personalities and great minds clashing in pursuit of a common goal. That's what makes this movie so suspenseful at every waking moment.The Imitation Game captures every aspect of what makes a movie like this good. They overlap multiple engaging characters with complex and trivial storylines that even at some times, don't make sense to the watcher until further explained. That's a common theme in this movie. I've never watched a movie that I've felt so emotionally attached to until I watched this movie.All in all, the movie is worth a watch. While the history genre remains niche and may not be for everyone, I've personally always been a sucker for ""based on true stories"" movies. It's a movie that even if you don't enjoy, will leave you with a feeling of empathy for Alan Turing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Sometimes it's the very people who no one imagines anything of who do the things no one can imagine,"The Imitation Game, a movie about Alan Turing, is far from the typical biopic.The one thing that immediately stands out are the three different timelines and how it manages to hold a nice balance between them.In 1928, a young Alan is a victim of bullying from his classmates but also discovers his homosexual nature. That is the shortest part, but it's essential in establishing Alan's background.In 1939 he joins a task force assigned to crack the Enigma code used by the Germans. Solving the puzzle is far from the only challenge he faces. He has a hard time cooperating with his colleagues, who he views as inferior, not to mention his ""boss"" can't stand him and wants to get rid of him. On the bright side, he meets Joan Clarke. It's not a romance in the traditional sense, but they form a touching relationship that provides much needed comfort to Alan and helps him in many ways, social and scientific. This part combines the thrill of racing against the clock (thanks to good editing images of war are used to show how it progresses and the situation is getting more and more desperate), the politcal games and conspiracies, a couple of comedic moments and of course a more human, emotional element that is based on the aforementioned relationship between Alan and Joan.In 1951 his dark secret is revealed. Instead of being honoured as a war hero, he is ridiculed and forced to choose between prison and chemical castration. This is by far the saddest and most painful part of the movie.Benedict Cumberbatch proves once again he is at the top of his game portraying brilliant, socially incompetent, arrogant yet melancholic figures.The movie delivers a powerful message regarding tolerance and prejudice that is best summed up in its catchphrase: ""Sometimes it's the very people who no one imagines anything of who do the things no one can imagine"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Good Movie: If you ignore 'based on a true story' aspects,"The movie is well shot and the story is decent enough. If you are interested in watching a movie that has solid acting with a relatively interesting script then you will likely enjoy the movie.Unfortunately, if you are interested in the historical facts of either Alan Turing or even anything that occurred during his time at Bletchley Park then you may be disappointed.The truth is that on completion of the movie you realize you actually were never even told a single thing about how the Enigma machine works, you would believe that Alan Turing broke the code single-handedly, and you may even think that Cryptography requires merely exceptional skills at solving crosswords, which is of course ridiculous. Consider that at no time is even the most basic of Cipher explained.In Summary, if you want to watch a decent movie and you don't care if the historical facts are accurate and that no technical details are ever explained then you will likely enjoy the movie.If you expect accurate history and you are interested in the real events / how the machine worked perhaps for example, you will be disappointed.That should summarize clearly, though I could elaborate further toward the negative in the technical / historical aspects; however, i assume most will enjoy the movie as is.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A disappointing telling of a great man and his greatest creation,"There have been plenty movies throughout the cinematic age of war and it's heroes, most of them pay homage to the heroes that defeated armies with their guns and ammunition and occasionally you will get the film that shows the one soldier who stood up and protected his war buddies on the field but how often do you get a film that goes behind all that action and still till this day has done more for mankind and its fight against those that wish to bring it down in one way or another, more than any cape wearing, hammer throwing, green giant or super human possible and best of all this person actually existed.The year is 1951, two police officers are at Alan Turing's a Cambridge Mathematician's home investigating a break and enter whilst during their interrogation Alan begins telling his story of back when he worked in Bletchley Park. Bletchley Park was the United Kingdom's central site of the Government Code and Cypher School. The film then flashes back to Alan's childhood in 1927 where he is a young boy who is given a code cracking book from his friend Christopher, a romantic friendship is formed between the two boys until the day Christopher doesn't come back to school. 1939 World War II, Alan travels to Bletchley Park, where, working under Commander Alastair Denniston, he joins the cryptography team of Hugh Alexander, John Cairncross, Peter Hilton, Keith Furman, and Charles Richards. The team are trying to crack the ciphers the Enigma machine uses, the Nazis use Enigma daily to send out orders but every night at midnight the code changes its the teams job to decipher these codes giving the allies the much needed break they require to get ahead in this war. Alan is a real pain to work with and despises his colleagues who feel exactly the same toward him. He works alone designing the machine that will decipher Enigma. Alan approaches Denniston to fund construction of the machine but is denied, Alan not giving in decides he will go to the top and writes to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, who then puts him Alan in charge of the team and also gives the funds to finish the machine. Turing fires Furman and Richards and to find their replacements puts a really difficult crossword in newspapers. Joan Clarke, surpasses all expectations and ends up on the team but due to her parents other arrangement about her newly found employment need to be arranged. Unfortunately in 1952 Alan is disgraced and sent to prison for the most disgusting reason imaginable I will not give away here...The story of Alan Turing and how he and his machine broke the unbreakable code was a real let down for me, Once the credits began to roll the only things going through my head was what I would have done differently had I directed the film myself, I really expected so much more and I'm more than surprised that such an amazing event in history was dealt with so placidly. According to the biography the film was based on a lot of the film was ""pampered"" to make it a lot more glamorous than it was in reality especially the relation between Alan and his fiancé Joan, Alan as a human was a lot more than the mad scientist as portrayed but I don't think that was the actors fault more the direction he was given. So if you take away the truth of the film and facts you are left with something that is somewhat entertaining for at least half an hour.In all things though there are the bad and there is the good what was fantastic about the film was the actors, I personally feel they did an amazing job. Benedict Cumberbatch (Star Trek, Sherlock) plays Alan Turing and he did a brilliant job at bringing his character to life, apparently the family of the real Alan Turing were amazed at how well Benedict portrayed their family member which really says a lot in my book. Keira Knightley (Pirates of the Caribbean saga, Domino) plays Joan Clarke, Matthew Goode who also wrote the screenplay (Match point, Watchmen) plays Hugh Alexander, Allen Leech (Downton Abbey, Rome) plays John Cairncross, Matthew Beard (One Day, The Riot Club) plays Peter Hilton and Charles Dance (Dracula Untold, Game of Thrones) plays Commander Denniston. I think without all these amazing actors this film would have failed in what it delivered. Morten Tyldum (Headhunters, Fallen Angels) directed the film and for me I can't help feeling if the film was directed by someone with a lot more experience and know how would have delivered a five star film. One thing he did do right though was using Alexandre Desplat to organise the soundtrack and score for the film, the other amazing aspect of the film.The Imitation Game was long and at times boring due to drab scenes and a very disorientated time line, there was a very important part of Alan's life that was only slightly touched, I'm not saying the film had to be LGBT themed but if that's who the man was then surely the film should have had a lot more about who he was emotionally and not just mentally.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Benedict Cumberbatch does a great job as Turing and the supporting cast (especially Charles Dance as the baddie) is convincing.The story is where it falls a little short for me. I would've loved a either a bit more on the actual problem solving part of ""Christopher"" (the machine cracking the Nazi code) and/or have a bit more on the implementation of it's capabilities during the war. As in ""Oppenheimer"", the ""personal"" segments were the ones where the film lost a little steam and it impeded the pacing a little.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"A Very well oiled machine, fueled by Benedict Cumberbatch","I'm not huge on biopics. To me they often feel like big budget documentaries with better actors. I'm not a fan of the genre because the movies within it rarely take any chances, they play it safe. I am a fan, however of those films within the genre that take chances: Amadeus, Schindler's List and now The Imitation Game.Although not as good as Amadeus or Schindler's List, this film is an amazingly well crafted story, intriguing and with a very important message. Above all stands out Benedict Cumberbatch's Alan Turing, maybe his best performance yet, one for the ages. Nearly every actor is great, especially Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley, surprisingly delivers a pretty solid performance as well.The things I didn't like about the movie are that there are one or two ""clever British movie"" clichés in there, which I didn't love. Just little things in the dialogue particularly at the beginning of the movie just felt kind of forced. Also, the movie feels like it just ends, pretty abruptly. It seems as if a third act is missing, or at least cut in half, missing the story behind Turing's years after the war.But overall, The Imitation Game is informative, well directed and acted and has earned a new spot in my heart as a biopic that doesn't play it safe, but ultimately scores.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Breaking the code,"This film is supposedly based on the life of Alan Turing (adapted from a biography of his life.) A pioneer in computer science, mathematician and cryptologist. During the war Turing was part of a team involved in breaking the Enigma Code.The character of Alan Turing tends to pop up in other novels and films usually in the periphery such as the Robert Harris fictional novel Enigma.The real Alan Turing's story had a tragic ending as he was arrested for homosexuality in the 1950s when it was illegal and he committed suicide.Over the years pressure have been placed to rehabilitate Turing's name. There is a road in Manchester named after him, his work in the field of computers and code-breaking in World War 2 eventually led to a posthumous pardon.The Imitation Game cast Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing and right from the early scenes we see our modern day Sherlock playing a genius like he was another Sherlock Holmes. Clever, insufferable, a loner, arrogant.I thought I would let that slide but the script which won the best adapted screenplay Oscar was I am afraid a ham-fisted clunker. It was determined to make the story uninteresting, dull and blah blah blah predictable.It is also probably far away from the actual true story. Just when you thought it was getting better it goes back to its default bad mode.For example when they do crack the code, the team start fighting and arguing and then one of them has a brother who just happens to be on a ship in the Atlantic which might get attacked.Then there is the communist double agent, but hold on there was a double agent in the fictional novel Enigma. It looks like that was added for dramatic effect.Then there is the ludicrous scene where the Commander and his cronies forcibly start to attack the code breaking machine having no idea what it does and wants to go back to manual code breaking when we have been already told that would take millions of years to succeed.It might had helped if it was explained to the audience how the code breaking machine worked.The real Turing also had a stutter which in this film is portrayed as being very mild. I much prefer Derek Jacobi's interpretation of Turing in the play and film, Breaking the Code where the stutter was more pronounced.The film is just clichéd rubbish and I was genuinely disappointed as to how poor it was. It got nominated for a Best Picture Oscar which is very much undeserved.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

I could feel the sympathy she has for Turing just from her eyes alone. Her struggles of being a women in the industry, the anger she has for the mistreatment, just so excellent.

Movie: The Imitation Game,"Based on a true story of Alan Turing, Morten Tyldum's Oscar-nominated movie The Imitation Game, depicted Turing's life during World War II as Alan Turing tried to crack the enigma code with the help from fellow mathematicians.The Imitation Game was vibrant and lively, engaging its audiences on three levels: The fascinating way the Nazis managed to outsmart the rest of the world until Turing came along, how his giant computer worked, and what happened to him in the end, when the truth about him was finally revealed.However, the movie had been criticized for inaccuracy, and historians claimed that Turing wasn't a socially awkward, fragile man as depicted in the movie, but rather a brave and courageous man. But still, I enjoyed the movie because it held the interest of the audience through several dramatic qualities.The lead actor and actress Benedict Cumberbatch, and Keira Knightley, did a fine job, even though he was perhaps too well fixed in the minds of the audience now as another peculiar genius, Sherlock Holmes.87/100",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

However, he is terrible with people - preferring to be alone, yet needing help to work on the project.Enter Keira Knightly as Joan Collins (think that was her name). She demonstrates her math skills too, and Turing starts breaking out of his shell and interacts with people much better.There is a great cat-and-mouse game between various levels of the British govt, which was fascinating to learn about. There was also various games played within his team, and these add to the drama as they are revealed.In the end, I found it very sad to learn that the British govt was as stuffy as they were.

But that didn't stop me from watching the movie and empathizing with all the people involved and the events depicted.In addition, in order to really understand whether this is true and accurate, it is necessary to delve into the historical sources, but in my opinion, without even delving into them and without researching anything, you can imagine how this once went.In my opinion, this plot and the idea of the film itself was very comprehensible and interesting, because after every action I was interested in watching and wondering what would happen next, because the actors participated here, who depicted everything so really and quite accurately, demonstrated the actions and told everything.The only thing that I didn't like very much and in my opinion made the movie more boring is the very beginning and the end of the movie, because both of these parts dragged on, although they could have been shortened and explained more clearly, so that the audience would be more interested in this story from the beginning . When watching the beginning of the film, I did not immediately understand this story, but after watching it, everything became more clear.I give this a 7/10, because the plotting of the story and the actions really interested me, but as I said, I didn't really understand the beginning or the end of the movie, because it dragged on and got boring for me. But since I haven't delved so much into history and according to other comments, I don't know if this movie is close to the truth or not, it even took me to further thoughts and feelings.I would recommend watching this movie to everyone who is interested in history and its events.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

"A disjointed and incomplete story of WWII code breakers, spies, and mathematical geniuses","The Imitation Game is a movie about code breaking, intrigue and personal sexuality that should resonate with some moviegoers of today. It brings to the forefront themes not fully explored and presented in most WWII movies. Artistically, the movie is told in a rather disjointed manner with bits and pieces of emotional drama. So, it is up to the spectator to create his or her own sense of the story as scenes come and go. The lead character, Alan Turing -- played by Benedict Cumberbatch -- is portrayed in a way that his personality might come across as being somewhat conflicted and troubled by his own circumstances, which -- unfairly -- is not a full reflection of his true character or own circumstances near the end of his life. Moreover, the movie tries to portrait him as a war hero, tech pioneer, social martyr, or troubled man in an incomplete and unconvincing manner. It is true that code breakers including Alan Turing played a decisive role during WWII, but others also made lasting contributions in so many ways during those terrible years. The movie's focus is more about the character's personal life than the events and circumstances that affected his society at the time, which was markedly totalitarian in the impositions of social norms. The movie has certainly gained considerable appreciation in certain circles of society, which routinely invoke and promote earthly (sometimes hollow) co-existence as the ultimate and indisputable way (and purpose) of life regardless of others' philosophical underpinnings or endless desire for the pursuit of universal truth. Therefore, we should expect more movies with similar themes as the informal debate about the ultimate purpose of life continues to unfold implicitly or explicitly in an already highly accessible art-driven medium.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Loved it!,This was such a good movie. I've had this movie on my to be watched list for a long time before watching it and the reason that drew me to watching it was Keira Knightly and Benedict Cumberbatch.I personally do not know of Alan Turings history nor did I read it up prior to watching the movie. I have heard of his name so it was nice to go into the movie with no knowledge of him and then conducting research after. It really showed the atrocities that people faced by the war and allowed me to see how it affected people.The acting by the actors was carried out quite well and very believable. Cumberbatch played Turing well and it suited him to play the role. It was a good mix of his invention as well as aspects of his personal life.If you are watching the movie with kids be aware that there is the theme of homosexuality and it is mentioned briefly which can be awkward but it is not entirely the main focus.I quite enjoyed the movie.

"Solid Film, Perhaps Just a Tad Bit Overrated","The Imitation Game has all the bells and whistles usually needed to create a successful blockbuster: strong lead actors giving strong lead performances, a script based on the fascinating accomplishments of Alan Turing, and a soundtrack scored by Alexandre Desplat (also known for his work on The Grand Budapest Hotel, Isle of Dogs, and Zero Dark Thirty).As many have noted, there is an emphasis on Turing's homosexuality which many seem to take issue with as being overbearing and taking away time that might have been better utilized on other aspects of who he is. And while I don't necessarily disagree with those reviewers, it did not bother me or take away from the brilliant story that is being told here.It's a good film.

Completely Brilliant,"Despite the few historical inaccuracies, this film is absolutely splendid. Mostly the little things that were historically inaccurate are there only to further along the plot in a cinema-friendly way for audiences who will be largely unfamiliar with the story. From the start, a viewer might think that they were watching another episode of Sherlock, since Mr. Cumberbatch is essentially just playing another socially awkward genius. But very quickly his performance separates itself from Sherlock entirely, and you see a very different sort of man, full of tragedy and longing as much as intelligence. His performance was exceptional and this film is vastly underrated. Keira Knightley demonstrated beautifully that she has grown as an actress since her Pirates days, and she was a great compliment to Cumberbatch's character. Some of the scenes that depict bomb dropping were created in a way that seemed out of place with the film, they were strangely animated. The last 20 minutes of the film will have anyone with a soul weeping.

Cumberbatch Holds Down the Fort,"A typically impressive leading performance by Benedict Cumberbatch ties together both the successful and the looser elements of the story. Overall, The Imitation Game can't escape coming off as distractingly historically inaccurate, which ultimately leads to a bitter aftertaste once the novelty of viewing another well acted biographical drama wears off. The character of Alan Turing himself is only paid arguably just homage, as he's portrayed with borderline Asperger Syndrome to keep with Cumberbatch's socially awkward genius typecast. That being said, the sacrifices in terms of history pay off in terms of drama, as viewers can feel the tension wanting to be portrayed by the crew in a more personal manner than if what historically happened was actually presented on screen. All in all, it's a recommendable drama, though not one of the best that 2014 had to offer overall.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

A fine example of how to tell a true story,"When you are watching a film that is based on a true story which you know nothing about it's a very different experience to watching one you know a lot about. I personally knew almost nothing about the work of Alan Turing and the effect he had on the second World War and from that stand-point I found it to be a fantastic film. I've been told by a reliable source (and also read a lot on IMDb message board threads) that a lot of facts/events in the film were falsified or altered for artistic purposes. While this is a bit of shame I think people need to keep in mind the difference between a movie and a documentary. As long as nothing major or character defining is changed I see no harm in changes that simply make the film more entertaining and enjoyable. This was the number one problem I had with fellow Best Picture nominee at the Academy Awards this year 'Selma'. Give me this over that any day.Benedict Cumberbatch has been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Lead Role for his performance in 'The Imitation Game'. From what I'm told he absolutely perfected the character of Turing. Turing looks like he would have been a fun character to portray. He certainly seems to have been an unusual man. The saying, ""There's a fine line between genius and insanity"" comes immediately to mind when speaking of him. A very fine performance but I can't see him taking the award home sadly, it was a very strong category this year.Speaking of strong categories, Best Supporting Actress was quite the opposite. Patricia Arquette is almost certain to take the award home for 'Boyhood' without almost any competition at all. Every other performance in the category has been about as bland as you could imagine and Keira Knightly in 'The Imitation Game' is no exception. That's not to say she's bad or anything of the sort. She's just simply nothing memorable or even a stand-out in the film. I kept thinking she must have an amazing final scene coming up that's going to blow me away, but no, it just never came.I suspect the only thing holding this back from taking a real crack at winning Best Picture is the small controversy marring it over ""historical inaccuracies"". Those aside it really is a well put together and moving film that gives a great insight into the genius that Turing was. What happened to him and his treatment by the courts was nothing short of a travesty. I absolutely loved Cumberbatch's quote regarding Turing's recent Royal Pardon, ""The only person who should be pardoning anybody is him (Turing)."" Sums the whole thing up perfectly. A very fine film, about a very fine man.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
the mind of a genius.,"This film takes the viewer inside the mind of a genius. In this case the genius is in the area of mathematical probability and a fascination with codes and patterns. Alan Turing has been hailed as the father of modern computer science. This film tells his story, and that of a major allied victory during WWII, that victory being the dismantling of the German Enigma code system, considered unbreakable.As a whole, the film works well. Benedict Cumberbatch does an outstanding job in taking the viewer into the mind of Alan Turing. Very Spocklike in his devotion to the job at hand, his portrayal of the eccentricities and oddities which put Turing at odds with his colleagues was excellent. Very much the loner in the middle of these geeks, Turing sets about solving the problem with the very efficiency of the machine he creates.**spoiler alert**I had a couple of problems historically. After the ENIGMA code is cracked, Turing advises not to tell anyone of the impending danger to a British cargo convoy directly in the path of German U boats because it would be a tipoff to the Germans that the code had been broken. This has been alleged, but NEVER Proved. The film implies that this incident was true. IN reality, the alleged decision not to go with critical information at the outset was Winston Churchill's. I am not sure why this movie put that incident in, but it did provide some drama as one of Turing's colleagues has a brother serving on one of the convoy ships.Secondly, the Poles actually had broken the enigma code, but it was a comparatively crude setup, Turing's machine made the process more efficient.The film was a nail biter all the way though. We see the typical set up of genius versus the system with the system going by the book, and in so doing trying to handcuff Turing all the way. Such was the way in part with Oppenheimer and the powers that be in developing the atomic bomb across the pond in America.By all accounts, Cumberbatch perfectly portrayed all the parts of this troubled genius, even to his personal life.Well worth seeing along with Fat Man and Little Boy for an accurate portrayal of genius on both sides of the Atlantic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

The story of Alan Turing is truly spectacular,"The story of Alan Turing is such a spectacular one, that even an unspectacular film like the Imitation Game is nothing short of compelling. The period detail is convincing and tech aspects of the film are top notch - all very well done by director Morten Tyldum, making his first English language film. There are some dramatic liberties of course, most of which work fine on screen - a major exception being a scene involving a member of Turing's team dramatically pleading for his brother's life on-board a naval vessel. Cumberbatch does a decent enough job as Turing and while he is committed to the role, when the man is stressed - Cumberbatch does some phony tics and speech mannerisms that come across as acting with a capital A. Knightley and Goode make the most of their roles and Dance does what he can with his one note and mostly antagonist role.

You need a good compelling story, the Production ability to make the story, a good Director, the ability of the actors to make the scenes believable; from the cinematography, to the soundtrack, etc.One of the things that I left out, is writing.The writing in this movie is what I found to be lacking. The acting by Benedict Cumberbatch was superb, the story matter in itself was enough to make a great movie.All the makings of a good story. You have one of the original Fathers of the computer, whose machine he designed helped win the war for the Allies, coupled with his tragic death due to the fact he was a homosexual, its a story to tell.However, this movie is not written well. I would rather the story had been written linearly, with no flashbacks. Even the flashback at the beginning would have been fine, if they had told the story linearly from there on out, but they didn'tThe flashback to his teen years and his first crush went nowhere and added nothing to the movie. Neither were the flashbacks to the police officer trying to ""solve a mystery"" that in real life wasn't a mystery. (Turing called the police in real life to report the robbery and then he naively admitted to the police his homosexual affair)The whole police matter could have waited till the end of the movie. I can understand wanting that to be significant in explaining Turings eventual suicide, but it wasn't.They also never explained(unless I missed it) all the scenes of him running. Turns out Alan Turing was quite the marathon runner, but that is never explained.I know that 2 hours of people sitting around doing math and trying to solve enigmas would be a boring movie, so they added drama and took some artistic liberties to fill around the specter of war and the race against time.I really liked the material, thought it was sad, yet very interesting movie, but it could have had a much better script",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Nomination. Nomination everywhere!,"Nomination. Nomination everywhere for ""The imitation game"" and Benedict Cumberbatch! So I was very curious of watching one of the more discussed film of this season. This movie half-surprised me, and half-thrill me. I was quite bipolar indeed. For the first stage I thought I was looking a particularly dramatic episode of The big bang theory. The connotation of the character as a cold genius unrelated with social norms, without humor and so on it's very in fashion in this period. Keira Knightley in addiction was very similar to herself: I like her but in my opinion there is a gap between her and a real star. She is always charming, and convincing but something misses! The secondary character are not characterized very well: they seem to change behavior without a individual development. The second part of the movie is better than the first. The rhythm of the movie becomes faster and the focus move on the drama of the War. The theme of Turing homosexuality was what I like most, maybe because unexpected. This part of the character was debated very well, as one of the characteristics of the character, not the only one.

Cumberbatch steals the show,"The recipient of 8 Academy Award nominations at this year's ceremony and the winner of the Best Adapted Screenplay category, Norway born director Morten Tyldum, who finds himself about as far away from his breakout thriller Headhunters as you could imagine, tells the true life story of mathematical genius and one of World War 2's key players Alan Turing in an assured manner that is however, to by the numbers to breakout into classic territory.With a typically strong and charismatic performance from everyone's favourite Sherlock Benedict Cumberbatch and with a real life story that is almost stranger than fiction, The Imitation Game is a film that is eminently watchable from its first frame to the last but once all is said and done there is worryingly little to bring your mind back to what you've just seen, which with a story like this shouldn't be the case.Tyldum directs in a visually impressive manner but with little true originality and even though his surrounded himself with ever wonderful composer Alexandre Desplat and solid D.O.P Oscar Faura, he can't make the Imitation Game break the shackles that tie it to the unshakeable feeling that this is a glorified TV movie, not a standout big production event. Tyldum and screenwriter Graham Moore try to shun these TV like qualities with a narrative that flashes forward and flashes back and never allows things to get to stagnant but it's not enough to elevate the film completely, with Cumberbatch coming to the rescue in this matter.In an ensemble that never gets to really shine, wasted Matthew Goode and I don't know how Oscar nominated Keira Knightly try their hardest but don't make much of an impression, Cumberbatch shines in one of his first truly lead big screen roles. His Turing is not likable in the normal sense but the man was far from normal himself. Cumberbatch plays the line between neurosis and humanity perfectly and it's a deservedly lauded turn by him.It would've been nice to get more of a feel for the greater ramifications of what Turing's invention meant to the overall picture of World War 2 and while Turing is an intriguing figure, the Imitation Game could've benefited from a more rounded supporting cast, but the Imitation Game never outstays its welcome and is a sufficiently produced snapshot of one of the Wars most important events and also one of the most important technological advancements of the last 100 years.3 and a half apple treats out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check into -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Good, but with a serious flaw","The Imitation game, by Morten Tyldum and with Benedict Cumberbatch starring as Alan Turing is an incredibly good movie. A movie that anyone interested in war-time-history ought to see.And ought to see not only once, but twice and maybe even three times.When that is stated, it does have serious flaw.Alan Turing's creation of ""Christopher"" - the machine that was used to break the Enigma Code, did so because he was an incredibly good mathematician, a sincere genius with mental connections that most of will never have.He didn't however, manage to create this machine because he was a homosexual. And that is the explicit message I get, after watching this film. When that is said, I don't think that homosexuals are in any way worse that any other of us, nor are they less worth. But their sexual preferences doesn't produce intelligence or genius. Their sexual choices merely makes them different.I've had several friends through the years that have chosen a homosexual life-style. One of them committed suicide, sorry to say. He was an overtly creative human being. And as said above, neither less or more worth than any of us. Just a human being - like us, struggling with his demons.When will people start raising homosexuals to something it is not? Don't they realize that they by this makes more problem for those that suffer from it, just as The Imitation Game actually will cause problems for an unknown number of homosexuals.Because of this, I cannot give more than 7. The movie was destroyed by its own propaganda. That's sad.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
War computing,"The story about Enigma has been told before. Also in the pictures. It doesn't stop it from being fascinating, but reality was probably more interesting than all film melodramas.This is one of them. It's not just about breaking the German codes, it's also much about homosexuality during a time when it was sociably unacceptable.But this film just tells. It doesn't give us any soul insights, which wasn't to be expected, since this is quite mainstream. England during wartime is shown in a rather competent way, but it stops there. And the exciting story about breaking Enigma is told once again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"A powerful story, but not a powerful film","No suspense felt, boredom at times. Alan Turing's real story holds the potential of a great drama that could more accurately and powerfully reflect his story, the consequences of his actions in history of humanity and technology.

Better than what i thought,I stumbled upon it on T.V. i did not really care about the movie when it first released and the prime reason for that is that i did not knew Allan at that time .. the movie dos not have a huge impact on you not like the theory of every thing and comparing Benedict performance with Eddie i can totally understand why Eddie got the Oscar Eddie really immersed himself in the role while Benedict was lame and did not make any effort .. i loved the scene when they cracked the code it was very thrilling,7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Not enough science,"This is a good flick. But if you are like me you started skipping the interpersonal stuff about halfway through. It would have been such a better flick if the gay agenda wasn't being pushed so hard. Okay, he was a sweet kid who fell in love with an older student. I can't help but wonder how he would have turned out in a school that wasn't all- boys. Some nice young girl might have taken him under her wing, and the rest of his life wouldn't have needed to be hidden. In either case, the interpersonal stuff was just in the way.Much more about the reasoning involved and the particulars of the development of his 'machine' would have made this so much better a motivating movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

"Disappointing: 'Enigma', 2001 is better...","I've just watched a movie on Netflix... 'The Imitation Game'... It is a well-produced, well-acted film about Bletchley Park, Alan Turing, and Enigma...
and it has so much propaganda in it, it makes me sick.
It's OK with Alan Turing inventing 'the Bomb', as his machine was called. And his struggles to build it.
But it goes downhill fast when it tries to claim that it helped the Soviets to win the war, as well as the Western Allies. The Soviets didn't need BP. they had their own espionage network right inside the 3rd Reich, inside its military-industrial complex. Where even BP couldn't penetrate.
It was called 'The Red Orchestra', and they knew every detail of German plans for Barbarossa from the beginning of the invasion to the Battle of Kursk.But as with everything else, the West tries to steal all the glory for 'winning the war' and seeks to ignore that the Red Army defeated 80% of the Wehrmacht on the Russian front. They have done this indirectly with The imitation Game.
This is never acknowledged or recognised in Western official historiography of WW2.
I regard The Imitation Game. as thinly veiled revisionist telling of WW2 with the centre at BP apparently giving the Soviets information they would not otherwise have had. Shame on them, those so-called Western Allies... The same as are anti-Russia and anti-China now.
And no I wouldn't recommend the Imitation Game. The earlier movie 'Enigma' made in 2001 is a much more enjoyable and non-propagandist film. The Imitation Game just shows how anti-Russian things have become in 20 yrs.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
One of the greatest emotional experiences I have the pleasure of witnessing,"Based on a true story, ""The Imitation Game"" tells the story of Alan Turing. A man bent on decrypting a secret Nazi code known only as ""The Enigma Machine"". He would eventually become the man responsible for fathering Turing Machines, or today, we call them computers. ""The Imitation Game"" ends up being one of the most emotionally drawing and best told stories of any movie I've seen.""The Imitation Game"" is one of the few films that I can call absolutely flawless. I constantly try to observe movies for what they do right and what they do wrong. Sometimes it improves the experience, sometimes it hurts it. I tend to try to immerse myself in the world to get a better feeling of what I am watching. During this movie, my immersion brought me one of the most emotional experiences that I have witnessed from a movie. I found myself interested 100% of the time, and could get a taste of the emotion that truly went into this film. I was laughing, I was feeling remorse, and there were moments where I was actually tearing up. The only other movie I have watched that made my physically shed tears was ""Marley and Me"", meaning that this film tries it's best to make your heart wrench. And it's one of the greatest feelings for a critic such as myself to experience. To feel actually emotion towards a film, to sit there in your seat and say to yourself ""Oh my god."" It goes to show that the movie was made with care, and that it was done perfectly.Now if you are a fan of comedy, then this movie also has its fair share of laughs. Ranging from intriguing and creative humor, to moments where a character is standing there awkwardly while others stare at him like ""What the hell did he just say?"" The movie has a great balance between ""Oh, man! Drama!"" and ""LOL!"" Which is always a wonderful thing to have. Trying to balance multiple emotions in a film can be a tough thing to do, and this movie did it perfectly.One did get an interesting feeling throughout this movie though. I felt like this movie took a lot of what the BBC can throw at you. Benedict Cumberbatch (as Alan Turing) had a very similar personality to Sherlock Holmes (also Benedict Cumberbatch) in the BBC series ""Sherlock"". But the depiction of Alan Turing also felt similar to the depiction of Vincent Van Gogh in series 5 of the popular BBC series ""Doctor Who"". As well as other series' from the BBC. It felt like a strongly created experience with content that I'm very familiar with, and I loved that. And even if I wasn't familiar with that sort of content, I still would have loved it!""The Imitation Game"" is no doubt one of the greatest movies I have seen. It's the most emotionally jerking film I have ever had the pleasure of watching. The entire time I was watching, I was completely absorbed in the experience. ""The Imitation Game"", honestly, had nothing wrong with it. The plot was great, the characters were PERFECTLY casted, it never ceased to keep me intrigued and amazed. It is easily one of the best film experiences I have had in my entire life. This movie is not something to miss. And if you do miss it, I pity you.Final Review Score: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Absolutely Brilliant,"Basically, I love movies that have ""based on true story"" label in it.Now, about this movie. I'm totally amazed and surprised that there was a mathematician behind World War 2 and he was also the man who actually 'fight' Hitler in a different way.He's so smart. I even didn't understand what he was saying in the whole movie. *laughs*Well, about the fact that he's gay... it's not surprise me because there are a lot of famous people who actually gay during that period. The punishment that his country gave to him was too cruel (considering the fact that he was the one who made England won the war).You guys must watch this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Fine acting but an highly inaccurate story,"This was a somewhat enjoyable watch but I thought the movie was deeply flawed in its core. First off, though the general story is true I doubted much of its historical accuracy. Also its characterization of Turing was quite unbelievable. Was he a genius? Of course, we can clearly see that. But was he a flawless machine of a human himself? No. His colleagues were even made out to be completely incompetent dunces as well. Turing's character was portrayed as a cocky self absorbed man which he may well have been, but a lot of the dialogue and humor in the movie seemed out of place and very unlikely. I'm sure a lot of this has been completely dramatized and romanticized, even down to the simple aesthetics of his creation. Cumberbatch is highly praised for his role which was a good performance but failed in some areas. One in particular that I saw was his awkwardness. He was supposed have extreme difficulty reading people which at times he tried to act like that yet at other times he was witty and socially connected which goes completely contrary to that personality.The film leaves the audience with some implied or outright stated conclusions that did not sit well with me at all. The first was that World War II can be diminished down to a conflict being run by ""a half a dozen crossword enthusiasts in Southern England."" The writers acted like these few people single-handedly ended the war. This is just utterly ridiculous. It was also claimed that Turing saved 14 million lives and ended the war early by two years. That is something that you cannot possibly put a number to. There is no doubt that they achieved something remarkable and were an immense help to the war effort, but think of everyone who was involved in this and especially the men who died on the battlefields (which they conveniently avoided throughout the film even the short scenes of the war they only showed machines, airplanes, tanks and no human lives). It was really a slap in the face and a disrespect to the honor of those who fought, not to mention countless others. Having all of the information from the Axis forces would do no good if there wasn't anyone to act on it.Another idea that they insinuated was that if you are incredibly talented at something you are above reproach or that no one can ever rightly cast judgement on you. Part of that I think was their small push of their own opinions on homosexuality. I think they were trying to implant their own views on the subject as a way of subtle under-the-radar propaganda. I am not saying that Turing wasn't unfairly treated in the end, but they make him out to be a flawless god-like man who could do no wrong just because of his intelligence. The film really avoided the subject of him and his inner demons, not to say that that should have been their main focus.His demise in the end was also very unclearly presented. A robbery, a forbidden relationship, and the other events surrounding it were spattered throughout with no real explicit telling of the facts. It was just another problem near the end that made this movie not nearly what it is cracked up to be.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
