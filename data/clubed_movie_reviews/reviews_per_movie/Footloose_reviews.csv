Unfair reputation.,"Prior to seeing this movie, all I had heard suggested that I was better off not watching it unless it was to ridicule. I looked at my uncle dancing round his living room to some of its music and asked myself if anybody expected me to take that seriously. It's got a place in movie history even for the title song alone, though, so I decided I couldn't live with myself unless I gave it a chance. It was definitely worth it.The style is reminiscent of a whole host of other '80's teen flicks, but only a handful are better. Most of the cast do great things with their roles. Kevin Bacon actually manages to make the clichéd concept seem kinda cool, here showcasing an easy charm that was to become the hallmark of much of his later work. Crucially, the music is actually pretty good too! (Even if I am torn between wanting to cringe and dance when I hear the theme!)On reflection it's no cheesier than something like ""All the Right Moves"" (which has a great cast doing their best but suffers from a plodding story) In fact, it's miles better! At least the music in ""Footloose"" gave the makers a viable way to pep things up whenever the story begins to flag. This film is much, MUCH better than I had been led to believe, so give it a chance if you ain't seen it yet but thought you knew the score. Chances are, you don't...",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Sure it's silly but it's an 80s teen musical,"Teenager Ren (Kevin Bacon) moves to a small mid Western town with his mom after his parents divorce. It seems the Reverend Moore (John Lithgow), of the town's only church, has totally banned rock and roll music from the entire town. He has a daughter named Ariel (Lori Singer) who is basically a hell-raiser--yet loves her father. Rem decides to stop the ban and bring the town back to life.OK--we're not dealing with reality here at ALL! A town banning rock music entirely is ridiculous and the town only has ONE church? And the game of chicken using tractors was just silly. And don't get me started on how Bacon, Singer, Chris Penn and Sarah Jessica Parker look WAY too old to be high school students--Singer was THIRTY when she did this! And how the heck did all the kids from the town learn how to dance so quickly? But, as a no brain musical, this does work.The opening sequence alone is great (it shows various feet dancing to the title tune). Also the acting helps a lot. Bacon is just great--he doesn't take the movie too seriously and gives out a very good performance. He also has a big dance number (to a song called ""Never"") which is him and THREE different stuntman doing the more unrealistic moves. Singer is too old for her role but she tries. Penn is pretty good as Bacon's best friend--his learning how to dance sequence is a highlight. Parker did this before she was known and she's not bad. Lithgow and Wiest are just great as the Reverend and his wife--Wiest has a great scene where she calmly tells him off and Lithgow (wisely) does not play the Reverend as a one-note character. You see him trying to understand his daughter and slowly realizing that music isn't bad.So--this is no ""Singin in the Rain"" but for a 1980s teen musical it's lots of fun. Great songs too. Just turn off your brain and enjoy!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Great 80s Flick!,"Small town America where dancing is banned. New kid in town conquers high school, catches the eye of the preacher's daughter and attempts to plan a school dance.Such fantastic music! Kenny Loggins in his prime!!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Silly, but lighthearted caper","""Footloose"" is a fun and very lighthearted motion picture that promises a good time and delivers.The film has a simple, if unlikely, plotline.  Streetsmart but gentle teenager Ren MacCormack(Kevin Bacon) arrives from the big city with his mother in the backwater town of Bomont.  Enrolling at the local high school, he is appalled to discover the town's adults have imposed a law on ""public dancing"" and rock music, as enforced and practiced by the local preacher(John Lithgow).  Ren quickly sets about changing things, falling in love with the preacher's daughter Ariel (Lori Singer) in the process.The story is a little unlikely yet it is perfectly suitable for the teenaged audience at which it is pitched.  The script takes some time to explore its simple theme - dancing and rock music, and what they symbolise for young people.  Three scenes help to lay this out.  The first sees Ren dancing by himself in a barn; the town meeting where Ren presents his case to the townspeople and explains to them the meaning of the dance; and the final prom sequence in which the teens of Bomont revel in their newfound liberation.As the leading man, Kevin Bacon carries off his role very well.  Ren isn't really a macho hero revelling in coolness, he's a down-to-earth young man trying to the right thing by his peers.  His romance with Lori Singer's character Ariel is formulaic but perfectly inoffensive.The film could have perhaps done with a little more nastiness to fully contrast against Ren's earnest intentions.  Even Ariel's brutish boyfriend(Jim Young) fails to inject much tension in this respect and the final fistfight between him and Ren comes across as being a bit lame.John Lithgow's characterisation is very good but it is a little too subtle. As the town Reverend and preacher of all things pure and holy, his extreme views come across not so much as puritanical, just merely uptight.  The change that eventually occurs in his attitudes is hinted at very early on. The result is that he is nowhere near is frightening or intimidating a character as he could have been.  At the same time his troubled relationships with his rebellious daughter and quiet wife(Dianne Wiest) are very well written and acted.  In these scenes he excels and his character's development seems very natural.On the technical side, the film is well-shot and the gloriously Eighties soundtrack complements the proceedings very well, bringing the necessary exhuberance and bounce to the whole movie.Whilst ""Footloose"" is certainly no masterpiece, it succeeds in being a lighthearted knockabout caper, and as such is a very enjoyable movie.",,Anonymous,Music
Gotta Cut Loose for Kevin Bacon,"Aw, come on IMDb'ers, why the low rating? Where's your sense of loyalty? I can't hear that Kenny Loggins title song and see those pairs of dancing feet during the opening credits without sitting down to watch this whole movie. And even if it's largely to make fun of it, I still love it for old times' sake.Kevin Bacon is the tough city kid stuck in some podunk Midwest town where dancing has been outlawed. John Lithgow is the preacher who serves as Bacon's arch nemesis; Lori Singer is the preacher's daughter who has a hankering for the new dangerous kid. Dianne Wiest is the reasonable mom who acts as referee between dad and daughter. The whole thing is sillier than an episode of ""Laugh-In,"" but many of the actors (particularly Lithgow, Wiest and Bacon) are good enough to actually sell the material. And come on, admit it, you know you like the music.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A very love it/hate it film- to me it isn't great but can definitely see the appeal,"'Footloose', despite being an enormous hit back in the 80s, seems to be a very divisive love it/hate it film critically now.This reviewer neither loves or hates 'Footloose', from personal opinion it falls short of being great but the immense appeal is definitely understandable.Its biggest weak point is the story. Conceptually it's daft, and further hampered by laying it on too thick with the ridiculousness (the drug scene and the basic concept) and over-sentimentality (the Reverend's somewhat tacky reform that didn't really ring true compared to how his character was written in general). Ren's dance routine in the abandoned warehouse was far too randomly placed, coming at an unrealistically weird point in the film.Lori Singer being too old didn't bother me as much as it did other reviewers, but the overacting, constantly looking as if she was trying too hard, was less forgivable. The script is uneven, sometimes it's humorously light-hearted and feel good and there is a laudable attempt at providing depth with some more mature themes but too much of it is also cheesy and flimsy.However, the songs are toe-tappingly great, especially the title song ""Footloose"" and ""Let's Hear it for the Boy"". The dancing is spirited, and apart from that one scene with Ren the choreography and dance numbers are finger-snappingly infectious. 'Footloose' is a good-looking film too, beautifully shot and smartly photographed with some inventive visuals in the title song, while the direction is solid enough and the pacing sharp and energetic constantly.Singer aside, the cast are simply terrific, with Kevin Bacon in the role that made him a star making for a good free-spirited lead and the sadly late Chris Penn proving that he had the talent to make it bigger than he did. Dianne Wiest doesn't seem capable of giving a bad performance, while John Lithgow is effectively subtle and wisely reigns in in a role that could easily have been the opposite.Overall, falls short of being a great film but the appeal is definitely understandable, because there are a lot of good elements that outweigh the still quite big flaws. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Great musical of the 1980's!!,"This drama/musical tells the story of young man who moves into a very religious community . The young man is played by Kevin Bacon. He finds out that the local preacher does not allow any music, dancing , fun in his town. Eventually with the help of some friends, he manages to talk the citizens to allow the teens to have a dance. This movie also stars John Lithgow from 3rd Rock from the Sun!!Footloose has awesome sound track , is full of great songs!!!This is one great musical along with Grease in the 1970's!!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Jump Back!,"Ah, yes, I did travel back to the 80's this morning watching the film Footloose starring then new comer, Kevin Bacon. The funny thing is that I performed Footloose in my high school, it's now like 5 years later and I realized when I bought this film yesterday that I had never seen the movie. I figured since it was so cheap for 5 bucks on DVD, I'd buy it for fun and I watched it this morning. Footloose is an absolute blast of a movie that I'm sure that anyone could get into. Yes, it's a bit of a time capsule, but it's still all in good fun. I liked how this wasn't necessarily your typical musical, it just had an awesome soundtrack with the movie. The story is just so much fun and original, you just fall in love with Ren McCormick from the start.Ren is a new guy from the big city of Chicago coming into a small town and now this small town has banished dancing since a big accident that happened years ago that killed several teens after a dance, there were drugs and alcohol involved, so naturally these folks think that it's all apart of dancing. But Ren's getting a hard time from everyone because of his fun loving nature, but he makes friends with a wanna be cow boy, Willard. Soon he also becomes the preacher's rebellious daughter, Ariel's love interest. He wants the kids to have fun though and wants a big dance thrown for the town and must convince them to cut their foot loose.Footloose is just a fun movie that I'm sure you'll have fun with. It's charming, it's funny, it's just a blast to watch, and it's an 80's classic. The acting was actually pretty good, we have a great cast that looked like they enjoyed themselves. Of course we'll always question how the kids just managed the skills of dancing, you'll see what I mean when you watch it, but it's all good. I would highly recommend this film, it's a fun one to watch. Kevin Bacon is totally cool and a must see for Footloose.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Kick off your Sunday shoes.,"'Footloose (1984)' very much follows in the footsteps of 'Flashdance (1983)', designed specifically to trap teens in a cycle of pop songs and popcorn as the film sells the soundtrack and the soundtrack sells the film. Unlike that earlier piece, though, this actually seems to have had some effort put into its narrative. The story is set around the overtly religious residents of a small town who believe rock music, dancing and, even, certain books to be the work of the devil. It focuses on a transfer student who tries to rally against the system and legalise dancing - because, yes, dancing is literally illegal - so that he can host an end-of-year prom. The set-up is promising, a tried-and-tested 'young against old'/ 'boy against the system' sort of thing, but it isn't really capitalised on. The meat-and-potatoes of the picture doesn't start until far too late, meaning that the movie only really picks up towards its final movement. It's not bad but it's all rather basic, with simple characterisations and no real sense of elapsing time. It doesn't feel like a high-school movie. It doesn't feel like a dance movie, either, because there are actually only a few proper dancing sequences (including a montage that may just be the most singularly eighties thing I've ever seen). The segments in which John Lithgow's reverend has to contend with the fact that his daughter is growing up are probably the most engaging, even if they aren't exactly deep and don't really entertain. As a whole, the film is just fine. It has a few enjoyable moments but it's typically a rather passive experience. There are a number of genuinely great songs on its soundtrack, which are easily the best thing about the entire affair. It's just a shame that the film itself can't live up to these. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Jon Monsarrat review:  underrated teen flick,"OK, maybe I'm giving in to nostalgia here but I rented ""Footloose"" recently and thought it was great. Yes, it's definitely a teen flick, similar to ""Dirty Dancing"", and aging a little now.But the music is great and the plot and themes do as much for me as ""Grease"" ever did. As teen movies go, it is somewhat original and interesting.Who should see this film:-- Teens with nothing better to do on a rainy day-- People reliving the 1980s, you won't be disappointed tosee this one againI'll give Footloose a 9 out of 10 because it cheered me up on a day I needed it.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"""Let's Hear It For The Boy""","Based on a true incident that happened in a small Oklahoma town, young Kevin Bacon arrives at a small town in one of the reddest parts of the USA. This small town is positively crimson because they've actually outlawed dancing except maybe in the privacy of your own home.This extreme and probably unconstitutional law started when a few years ago Reverend John Lithgow and Dianne Weist's son was killed after one of these dances. Lithgow himself is not an extremist, but he's letting some of the more extreme rednecks in the town to start in on book burning. As Robert Preston said in The Music Man, ""Gotta keep the young ones moral after school"".Of course Bacon takes up with Lori Singer who is Lithgow and Weist's other child when he arrives and she's quite the wild child. But his standing up to her old man impresses her like none of the other young men in the town.Footloose has a nice liberal message about the excesses of religious zeal which is certainly pertinent for today. But it's the musical score in the film that really makes it special, one of the best scores of the Eighties. The title song and Let's Hear It For The Boy both received Oscar nominations for Best Original Song.This film proved to be Kevin Bacon's breakout role as an actor. Although he never was quite leading man material as his subsequent career has proved, he's certainly had staying power in playing a nice variety of roles of both good and bad and mixed individuals. No question here he's the good guy outsider. Best scene for me is him teaching Christopher Penn how to dance to Let's Hear It For The Boy.A film quite ground in the Eighties, Footloose still has much relevance for today's audience.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

DRAMA/ MUSICALI used to like this film, when I was like, a lot younger, but since then, after watching it again after many years, suddenly feels extremely simplistic, tame and self indulgent, despite the catchy soundtrack, has Kevin Bacon as a rebellious teenager, Ren MacCormack against the towns strict rules, especially against dancing and rock n' roll music etc...May be better appreciated by people who're anti-conservative, but for the rest of us, it's way too long with it's point seen a mile away, way before the film is even over.

A must see for all lovers of 80s and cheese,"This charming, cheese-tastic 80s teen flick is packed full of great songs. The soundtrack alone is enough to make it worth a watch. But on top of the fabulous soundtrack, the story is surprisingly good and its actually well acted. Lori Singer's character is rather intriguing and her progression throughout the film is possibly the best thing about this film, despite Kevin Bacon obviously getting all the credit as the main character, Ren. Chris Penn is an exceptional supporting actor and this film really does not deserve some of the hatred it gets. It's almost 'cool to hate'. As long as you're not expecting too much and just want a fabulously 80s, uplifting, feel-good film, then you can't go too far wrong with footloose.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Great, Fun 80s Film","A city teenager (Kevin Bacon) moves to a small town where rock music and dancing have been banned, and his rebellious spirit shakes up the populace.There is really no need to review a film that everyone has already seen, but I will just say this: it is rightfully a classic. Great characters, great actors, great story, great dance moves. The soundtrack alone makes the movie worth watching.Two things of note: one, Chris Penn was really thin and physically fit when he appeared in this film. What the heck happened? Two, why is Ariel supposed to be desirable? She is full of herself, far too head-strong, and openly flaunts her infidelity. There is nothing admirable in her character... surely Ren could do better.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Guaranteed to lift you up,"A film of enormous charm. It's about dancing but unlike many films about dancing it doesn't take itself seriously. It's loose-limbed and goofy and it lifts you up. It's set in a high school in a small mid-western town where dancing has been banned; (it reminds me of a joke I heard here in Ulster; 'Why do Free Presbyterians disapprove of making love standing up?' 'It might lead to dancing').Kevin Bacon is the new kid in town who wants the ban lifted. Indeed, this boy seems to live to dance and he's immensely likable. He uses his killer smile to great effect. In this movie the dancing is integral to the plot and it evolves from it naturally and, for once, the director Herbert Ross takes things easy. As well as Bacon, the film has Lori Singer, (the obligatory love interest), and John Lithgow and Dianne Wiest as her parents. He's the bible-thumper who thinks that dancing is sinful and Wiest, with her wan, other-worldly smile, is the wife who doesn't as well as a very young Chris Penn as the over-weight farm boy Bacon teaches to dance in a wonderful sequence choreographed to Denise Williams' 'Let's hear it for the boy'",8.0,Anonymous,Music

It makes me feel like dancing,"EVERYBODY CUT FOOTLOOSE As we all know 1984 produced a lot of great things. One of the best was ""Footloose"". Here's my thoughts on this timeless masterpiece which I brought on DVD this week-Most good movies have a great opening and Footloose is no exception. A bunch of feet dancing showcasing the great footwear of the 80's to the soundtrack song ""Footloose"". Immediately gets you in -Kevin Bacon's character has one of the all-time great movie names: ""Ren McCormack"" -Funny how this is probably Kevin Bacon's greatest role, maybe only challenged by ""Flatliners"". It's amazing how so many actors never repeat their efforts of their first breakthrough movie (See Lou Diamond Phillips, Chris Rock and Madonna for starters) -Also starring in this movie is one of Hollywood's greatest lesser known brothers, Sean Penn's brother Christopher. He's way better than Dan Swayze or Charlie Murphy. -Kenny Loggins will go down as one of the greatest contributors to movie hit songs ever. Footloose's ""Footloose"" and Top Gun's ""Danger Zone"". -This is another one of those movies built around a town's overzealous pastor's. Reverand Shaw (John Lithgow) is even more intense than that guy in ""Chocolat"" -Great action scene at the start with Lori Singer car surfing (watch the slightly impossible way she gets back in the car) -Also look for the great David Hasselhoff 2 second cameo -Great scene where the Rev turns off Lor Singer's ghetto-blaster. Everyone stops talking, eating and dancing. Possibly slightly dramatic -Will (Christopher Penn) tells us several other towns have also banned dancing. How wasn't that fact used as the premise for heaps more sequels with Ren going from town to town and reviving dance? Each time he'd face a new obstacle. -Ren mentions his love for ""Men at Work"" and ""The Police"", yet he only listens in his car to bad 80's electric rock. Strange. -Weird town. Here a face off equals a tractor fight. -One of the funniest moments is when Chuck gets onto his tractor and puts ""I need a hero"" on on his ghetto-blaster. That would be awesome to do at a basketball game when you sub in. -Another great Dianne Weist performance. That girl can just capture the whole audience when she wants. Underrated actress. -""Moment I regret now""- Christopher Penn's dance sequence to ""Let's Hear It For The Boy"" (although it's a great sequence in the movie) -Kevin Bacon's speech to the council was possibly the greatest speech up until that time in cinema history. That is until Sly Stallone raised the bar with his ""If I Can Change...."" in Rocky 4. Which was then overtaken by Matthew McConaghuey's ""Can you see her..."" speech in ""A Time To Kill""",8.0,Anonymous,Music

"Entertaining flick, decent message, decent characters","""Footloose"" is a lot of fun to watch.  The main high-school characters are very likable and we sympathize with their ""oppression.""  Even the initially unsympathetic authority characters, led by the Rev. Moore (expertly portrayed by John Lithgow), are given some genuine depth in this movie. They aren't just mindless martinets.  Their beliefs are shown to have some credible foundation, although most of us wouldn't agree with them.The kids, too, are shown fairly realistically.  They are not portrayed as over-idealized defenders of artistic freedom.  They just want to have fun. And it is fun watching them have fun.  I was particularly drawn to the slightly goofy, yet faithful, secondary characters played by Chris Penn and Sarah Jessica Parker.  I thought to myself, ""Those are the kind of people I'd like to hang out with.""  The picture of adolescent friendship shown in this movie is very appealing.Sure, the plot is a tad formulaic.  But who says you can't have fun with a good formula, particularly when it presents a decent message embodied in decent characters?

At least the music was good..,".. And Kevin Bacon makes me question my sexual preference but that's about it for the positives.. Some nice dancemoves thrown in there as well but the story was really not that interesting.I liked the premise about dancing being illegal and the kids rebelling against parental authority, cool idea but the execution was rather questionable. I like 80s cheese in general but this didn't agree with me. It's comparable to Dirty Dancing and Flash Dance in terms of music and dancing but they were far superior in terms of storytelling. This one fell short. It would have worked better with an R-Rating.Not the worst movie I've seen but still I don't feel the need to see it again, once was enough.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

This was a very good movie!,"I really enjoyed watching this movie, but the one thing that irritated me was Ariel, I just DID NOT like her character, and have no idea why Ren would take an interest in her. I know that she was very pretty, but she was annoying and thought that she was the best thing in the world and she was a slut. I know that that's not even what the movie was about, it just really bothered me.I would recommend watching this movie because it is something different, but in a good way. This small town in Georgia has made dancing illegal, which we all know would probably NEVER happen. It's about this one guy who moves from a big city to this small town and fights against the court trying to make it legal again.I do live in Atlanta, Georgia, and I do know that people here don't have a strong southern accent because we live in such a big city with many different people from around the world. I do know what people sound like outside of Atlanta, and the way they sounded in the movie was not it, but it didn't bother me that much.

The Power of Music,"37 years after its original release I decided it was time I gave in and checked out Footloose. I'm glad I did because I actually kind of enjoyed it. Sure, the story is full of cliche's and progresses mostly as one would expect. I do think all of the performances are solid though and offer some likable characters. It was fun to see a very young Kevin Bacon and Sarah Jessica Parker. Pondering what really made this viewing work was in large part thanks to the music. The music, which due to the passage of so much time, has brought with it a ton of memories and nostalgia for the 1980's in general. So despite many shortcomings I have to say that I did enjoy Footloose and for anyone else who still hasn't seen it I suggest you check it out too.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Fun Teenage Rebelion Picture,"Footloose (1984)*** (out of 4)A teen (Kevin Bacon) from Chicago moves to a small city, which has been ruined by a preacher (John Lithgow) and his wife (Dianne Wiest) who have convinced everyone that dancing and rock music are sins. The teen gets in trouble for what he believes in but soon he starts to show the others what a good time can come from dancing. Yes, the story is incredibly silly and yes it's incredibly predictable but who cares when something is this fun? FOOTLOOSE is just like those drive-in films from the 1950s, the ones that tried to explain to parents why rock and roll music wouldn't turn them into evil demons. This type of film was running wild back in the 1950s and I think it works perfectly well when updated to 1984. Again, I don't blame anyone for attacking the story but those who do so are just taking it way too serious when the main goal of the movie was to have viewers just kicking back and having a good time. I think the majority of the success is due to the terrific performance from Bacon who perfectly fits the role of the outcast who tries to take on an entire community. Bacon was exceptionally believable in the part and handled everything from the dramatic scenes to the lighter ones. Even his dancing hits the high marks. Lori Singer doesn't come close to matching him but she makes for a nice supporting player in the role of the girlfriend. Lithgow is his typical entertaining self and it's nice seeing Wiest even though her role is terribly underwritten. Another big thumbs up has to go to Christopher Penn in his role of the redneck who doesn't know how to dance. Another major factor to the film's success is the terrific soundtrack including the hit title track by Kenny Loggins. I'm not sure why anyone would go into FOOTLOOSE expecting some sort of art picture. It's a fast, fun film dealing with teenagers and rock and roll. It might not be a Bergman film but it's still very entertaining and that's the most important thing.",,Anonymous,Music
"Not brilliant, but difficult not to like","Ren McCormack moves from Chicago to a small town and is bemused when he learns that dancing has been banned in the place that he now calls home. Determined to change all that, Ren pits himself against hardened preacher Reverend Shaw Moore whom views dancing in a different light and stands against the negative connotations he perceives that it will bring to the town...I've always had a bit of a soft spot for films which pit the little guy against the 'bigger guy.' This usually applies to an individual taking on a large corporation, but given the fact that most of the town were against Ren's proposal this can still apply to Footloose only in a slightly different context. The story is not exceptional and many of the characters portray the same cliched types we've seen before - although none of them were what I'd consider to be annoying which was a plus.I think what makes the film enjoyable and watchable is the sense of fun and energy that is in abundance throughout the film. Not much time goes by between scenes before we're hearing uplifting pop songs popping in and out throughout the story and many of them are 80's classics...well cheesy classics... which does help.The likes of Kevin Bacon, Lori Singer, Chris Penn and John Lithgow all put in strong performances. The rest of the supporting cast are all OK, but aren't given as much to do as the aforementioned 4 actors.Undoubtedly with this being an 80's film it is a bit cheesy at times and melding drama and cheesy music it passes through you like a stiff breeze and will likely be forgotten from your mind not long after the credits finish rolling. Yet it is upbeat, has charm and hearing those cheesy 80's tunes helps with some of the uplift. As I said in my summary, it's hardly a masterpiece, but at the same time it's a film that's difficult not to like.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Opportunity Knocks for Kevin Bacon,"Like the ""Special Collector's Edition"" DVD says, ""'Footloose' jumps with spirit, dazzling dance numbers, and an electrifying musical score.

Ren revolts with best friend Willard (Chris Penn) and the minister's daughter (Lori Singer)."" Veteran director Herbert Ross guides everyone's steps well.""Footloose"" makes a few of the mistakes ""teen"" movies make, but it still kicks up some fun. In a way cool haircut, Mr. Bacon and his stunt doubles perfectly accompany a terrific soundtrack. He and the young supporting cast have, in hindsight, the kind of chemistry casting directors can't manufacture; they're fun and unforced. Introduced like the prerequisite stupid adults, John Lithgow and Dianne Wiest get to add more depth than you'd expect. And, Mr. Penn's dance instruction is topflight.******* Footloose (2/17/84) Herbert Ross ~ Kevin Bacon, Lori Singer, John Lithgow, Chris Penn",7.0,Anonymous,Music
An anachronism... but very hard to dislike,"Maverick teenager Kevin Bacon is ready to challenge the system when he moves to Bomont, a small town where the local preacher and the town council have banned dancing and rock music. The concept is an anachronism which feels contrived from the get go; the film's heart and characters belong in the 1950s, but they have been made to look and talk like greasers circa the 1980s. If not for a heartfelt, balanced performance from John Lithgow as the preacher, and sympathetic turns from Lori Singer as his daughter, Bacon in the lead, and a wonderful Chris Penn as Bacon's new pal, the film probably wouldn't have worked at all. With its predictable plot developments, this is touch and go all along. It never quite feels like director Herbert Ross (The Goodbye Girl, California Suite) is in touch with the youth culture he tries to convey. Still, the story has a sweetness to it that makes it very hard to dislike. Kevin Bacon's speach before the town council, and the inevitable, rewarding ending are among the highlights. And there are of course lots of great 1980s dance songs for those who enjoy that.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Footloose is an iconic '80s gem, a must-see for fans of fun films from that era","I recently watched Footloose (1984) on Max. The storyline revolves around a young man moving from the city to a small Midwestern town where dancing is illegal. Together with fellow kids, they work to petition a policy change and organize a school dance.Directed by Herbert Ross (The Turning Point) and starring Kevin Bacon (Friday the 13th), John Lithgow (The Manhattan Project), Dianne Wiest (The Birdcage), Sarah Jessica Parker (Sex and the City), and Chris Penn (Reservoir Dogs).Does it get more '80s than this? The clothes, hairstyles, activities, and dialogue perfectly capture the carefree aspects of that era. The cast is brilliantly selected; Penn and Bacon are particularly entertaining. The soundtrack and dancing are brilliant, with hilarious dance training scenes. The tractor chicken game and the final showdown in the town and dancehall scenes are legendary. Impressive coming-of-age elements, parents never too old to learn, and vivid depictions of high school fun make this a must see.In conclusion, Footloose is an iconic '80s gem, a must-see for fans of fun films from that era. I would score it 7.5-8/10 and recommend watching it at least once.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
The cure-all power of dance!,"Either I missed the boat on this one, or it's really as superficial as ""Flashdance"". ""Footloose"" has that packaged-for-MTV feel to it and the rest is cartoonishly serious. I dig Lithgow, but his character's turn from pained fascist to sympathizer is awful. Between the book-burning scene and the spirited game of tractor chicken (set to ""I Need a Hero"", sheesh), this gets pretty silly. What was odd is that usually movies are able to pull off teenagers with older actors, but everyone looked way too old here.This is a soundtrack movie all the way, and Loggins is calling the shots. But I'd rather just have the album.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Music
music,"This is the first movie I ever seen in the theater I must have been 13 or 14 when this came out,, and to me it still holds up well, I haven't seen the remake,, nor do I really want to,, this soundtrack is totally amazing, I had to buy it as soon as it came out,, the music fits almost every scene in the movie,, Kevin Bacon star just took off after this movie,, Lori Singer is really beautiful and did some decent acting,, although her character I didn't care for, Chris Penn did a wonderful job,, but John Lithgow steals the show for me. a young man moves to a town where he doesn't know anybody , has to make friends, and finds out that the town has a ban on dancing because of a horrendous accident many years ago,, he has to convince to the town that times have changed . excellent picture,, I never get tired of this movie...",10.0,Anonymous,Music
loosely-woven fun,"This film has several flaws -- Lori Singer's rural accent comes and goes, mostly goes; the members of her high-school class, who've never attended so much as a lunch-hour sock hop, turn into some of the greatest dancers in middle America during the last 10 minutes -- but who cares? FOOTLOOSE is great fun, and is worth seeing. It even contains a redeeming social message about values and tolerance. Sit back and enjoy the sheer exuberance of Sarah Jessica Parker, the pre-corpulent Chris Penn, the lung-collapsing beauty of Lori Singer, and the energy and enthusiasm of Kevin Bacon. I would recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
where is Lori singer and why hasn't she done more,"I have always like this movie for its upbeat music and Kevin Bacon. But the big mystery is Lori Singer hasn't done anything since about 1995 and really nothing much since this movie. Reading her biography one can understand that she is extremely talented especially in music, but it's a shame that she didn't continue to do more feature films. She is a beautiful woman. Yeah when I watched the movie last night I saw the big snow capped mountains in two scenes and wondered what mid west town is this? Yes you could say that there is some cheese in the movie, but it is entertaining if not predictable. Watching Dirty Dancing twenty years later gives you that same feeling.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Time Has Not Been Kind To This,"I saw ""Footloose"" in the theaters in 1984. I was in high school and enjoyed. However in the years since its been released it has left a huge imprint on America. It is easy to understand why. The film itself had a huge best selling soundtrack album that not only included the title song but also classic tunes ""Let's Hear it for the boy"" and the often covered ""Holding on for A Hero"".People love this film however those who love this need to see it again. Time has not been kind. Even though the Crazy Right WIng Jerks seem to be taken over the United States today in 2017 they also had a grip on the United States in 1984 ""The Reagan Era"".In this film a teen moves to town with his mom and they live with her brother. The town seems to be ran by a jerk who is not the mayor but a Preacher on a Bully pulpit. The adults act like drones. They think the preacher was right in outlawing ""Dancing"" and ""Liquor"".Well all of that gets tested when Ren (Kevin Bacon) moves into town and decides to challenge everything that is banned.The film itself has great moments but on the whole (but even in 1984) the film is campy. Today the camp is now dated but the crazy. Keven Bacon and Lori Singer are good but the film scenes with the Reverend drag this film down! IT makes it boring. In the remake they should have had Ren of the Reverends daughter shoot him!In real life the Crazy Christians seems to have multiplied across the United States.I am sure if they read this review they will vote NO about this review being helpful, Well they can suck it!",6.0,Anonymous,Music
just fun,"obviously this is one of those teen movies where you don't expect much to happen other than the usual stuff, you know, guy meets girl, guy faces problems and then over comes them and in the end everything turns out okay and everybody's having a good time. it's the same here, though the film is kinda week and has clichés in it, still it didn't bother me and it actually made me wanna dance, which is pretty good. like i said, this film doesn't contain much, but it's good, it's fun, you might enjoy it, so i'd say it's a good choice if you wanna see something that'll distract you for a while. by the way, this is probably one of the first movies where Kevin bacon stars in it, so you can use it as a reference to compare how his movie choices have changed over the course of his career.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
fantastic my sons loves it,my 20 month old son loves footloose he first watched when he was 6 months old and now watches it 2-3 times a day its fantastic and dances every time its on and follows the steps that they perform he knows footloose is about to start as soon as the paramount picture comes up on the screen. i recently had to buy another copy of this movie as he had worn the first one out he also has a copy in his granddads van so he watch it whilst out.if there was ever a remake of this film I'm sure my son would love it just as much a the original one. i think it amazing that a film from the 80's can please a 20 month old baby it amazed me and my family and i hope he will continue to like it a long time yet,10.0,Anonymous,Music
Pretty Good,"I finally watched ""Footloose"" from 1984 and enjoyed it however I do prefer the 2011 remake. This older film seems a little dated now though I do like some of the 80's songs. Both films are largely similar. I rate this older film 6/10 and the newer one 7/10. Worth watching either if you are in the mood for something frivolous and Americana.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

"""A time to mourn and a time to dance"" - Ecclesiastes 3:4","RELEASED IN 1984 and directed by Herbert Ross, ""Footloose"" chronicles events in the small Western town of Bomont where dancing and loud music have been outlawed because of an accident that killed some kids years earlier. Preacher's daughter Ariel (Lori Singer) rebels against the legalistic measures while taking liking to a new student from Chicago, Ren (Kevin Bacon), whom her father (John Lithgow) disapproves of because he perceives Ren as a ""troublemaker"" who wants to change the town laws against dancing.Also on hand are Chris Penn as Ren's ""country boy"" pal, Willard, and Sarah Jessica Parker as Ariel's friend, Rusty. Penn's character is real fun and Sarah was a real cutie back in '84.I stayed away from this film because of Roger Ebert's scathing review and the fact that I thought the story was about some big city fop moving to a small town and dancing on the tables of the local high school, etc. I was wrong (and so was Ebert). The protagonist, Ren, is no dandy; in fact, he can kick some arse if necessary. And you never see him dancing through the halls of the high school or whatever. He's a professional-class gymnast and his dynamic solo work-out at the factory is simply a matter of blowing off steam, which is a form of healthy venting.Although I stayed away from ""Footloose,"" the film acquired a respectable following and this inspired me to finally view it. I now understand why it's so popular. ""Footloose"" has that cinematic magic that pulls you in and gives you a good time. This is just a really entertaining movie with an exceptional soundtrack of songs made for the move with no less than six top 40 hits, like the title track by Kenny Loggins and ""Holding Out for a Hero"" performed by Bonnie Tyler, plus a couple of other significant ditties, e.g. ""Bang Your Head"" by Quiet Riot.Surprisingly, ""Footloose"" also has depth and is actually moving. We understand Rev. Shaw Moore's grief, but his rigid law-ism isn't doing his people or town any good. I like how Shaw isn't made out to be the clichéd villain. This is a good man thinking he's doing the right thing for his town, and in many ways he is, but the legalistic spirit he cops is sapping the life out of him, his family, his congregants and his town. Does he have the wisdom to see his error and re-route?BOTTOM LINE: Footloose is easily the best of the Big Three 80's dance movies and actually made significantly more at the domestic box office than ""Dirty Dancing"" ($80 million compared to $65 million). It has heart, a great cast, a superb soundtrack, all-around entertainment and real-life mindfood. It's also based on a true story that occurred in Elmore City, Oklahoma. Actually, there were similar towns with the same laws throughout America (and maybe still are).THE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 47 minutes and was shot in areas 30 minutes south of Salt Lake City, on the eastern side of Utah Lake.

Who is that guy??,"Footloose is a cool movie. I remember loving it when I was younger. Now I can't really stomach the story, but always hold out for the dance scenes. It's great to watch, just for the fun of it and you look at how Chris Penn is twice the man he used to be :)I just watched it a few minutes ago and I need to know who that pop-locking dancer was at the end, he was sick!!! I just wanted to know if he stayed in dance, if he was successful with it. He was so cold, I forgot how much fun the 80's were!! Growing up in the 80's and Reaganomics wasn't all that bad, I guess. It gave us some the most colorful movies and characters which I have yet to see it's equal.Footloose is definitely great for some laughs, and Kenny Loggins' songs were awesome, he was like the 80's movie song king, I used to love him!",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Overrated and dull,"This movie could have had some serious potential but unfortunately it was just bland. The plot itself is not bad and it's actually interesting but the execution of it was pretty horrendous. A kid who moves from Chicago to a small town, that could actually be an interesting premise to build on but it just did not work.A plot should be clear and focused, in this case there was just way too much jumping around different plot points to the point where it actually became annoying. There weren't any stand out moments from the film except the warehouse dance scene which was pretty good. The other points such daring each other with tractors, jumping from one vehicle to another and standing in front of the train were honestly just dumb. While teenagers often do stupid things, there's never that much stupidity in the span of a few days.The whole plot with the reverend and his daughter is just uninteresting and it ought to have been handled differently. The film does a good job of showing character growth but it was so dull that it just didn't matter because we weren't invested in the character.The final dance scene was okay, although I wasn't too keen on the actual dancing itself. It did lack talent but that's not a major issue. For a film about dancing, there was actually very little dancing.There were certainly some great parts but I was waiting for the film to pick up and when it did, it was towards the end at which point I had simply lost interest.The good parts of the film weren't strong enough to overcome the bad and so I think this will remain a pretty dull movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
"Now a classic, all the high school kids wanted to do was dance.","Much was made in entertainment news of 2024 being the 40th anniversary of the release of ""Footloose."" There even were special reports from the Utah high school where much of the filming was done. Kevin Bacon even agreed to make an appearance at an event. So I found the DVD of the movie at my public library. My wife and I watched it last night, even enjoying the music we used to listen to.Kevin Bacon is Ren who moves to this fictional mountainous community of Beaumont (not the one in Texas). He soon figures out the local preacher has influenced the townspeople that music and dancing are dangerous and bad so they have been banned. Except, of course, calming classical music that the preacher chooses to listen to. But Ren, a gymnast and a dancer, wants to change that.As it turns out the preacher's daughter is Lori Singer as Ariel and she is the usual rebellious teenager, she has a hard time sticking to her dad's rules. She also wants to dance.Her dad, the preacher, is played well by John Lithgow who it turns out was about 37 during filming but plays a 40-something man who has been married for 20+ years.I suspect everyone knows, even those who haven't watched the whole movie, that there was in fact the restoration of ""proper"" dancing, Ren even used bible verses referencing dancing as part of his argument at the town meeting.This is a good movie and now, a classic. I am surprised that its IMDb rating is rather low. It was also fun seeing Sean Penn's younger brother, Chris Penn, who unfortunately died young at 40. Also Sarah Jessica Parker, still a bubbly teenager during filming.",,Anonymous,Music

Kevin Bacon have some hokey fun,Ren McCormack (Kevin Bacon) and his mom are new in the town of Bomont coming from Chicago. The small town is so repressive that dancing and loud music has been banned. The conservative atmosphere is stoked by the bible thumping Reverend Shaw Moore (John Lithgow) who is haunted by a personal loss. Of course the reverend's daughter Ariel (Lori Singer) is the wildest teen of them all.This teen movie is hokey and fun starting with the title song by Kenny Loggins. There is some fun cheese like Kevin Bacon dancing in the abandoned factory. But then there are also some very serious issues going on. The reason it works is Kevin Bacon. It's his boyish charm. And what ever happened to Lori Singer? She's great in this as the rebellious preacher's daughter. It's also interesting to see Sarah Jessica Parker in the best friend role.,7.0,Anonymous,Music
Good film,"Good film as he learns that Rock music and dancing have been banned in the town for some time by Reverend, Moore (Lithgow). Ren also has difficulty fitting in at first, but soon makes some friends and finds romance. Ren eventually persuades Moore and the townspeople to allow dancing and rock music for the town's offspring. Singer plays Moore's carefree daughter, Ariel who falls for Ren, the late, Penn (Reservoir Dogs) plays Ren's new pal, Willard whom he teaches to dance, Parker (Sex and the City) plays Rusty, Willard's girlfriend and Wiest (The Lost Boys) plays Moore's wife, Vi.

When Peter brought up this movie to Peter when they were on Titan. This movie was an instant staple in my legendary head,"Movie of the week continues after a classic showing of Grease.

Read my review and you'll find out.About: A fundie town pushes their sinking sand ideology while the young people want to be secular, wild and loco.Story and production: First thing I noticed was The females. In this they have huge facial, horse face structures. None of them look attractive at all. The crusty shoes at the beginning look way better. I highly question who or what these ""females"" are.They story seems very stubborn to appear. It has an unclear plot with forced behaviours. By the time you realize that there is a story, it's about allowing the youth to dance... Yup. Dancing was outlawed like faces were in 2020.The romance was sort of forced and obvious. Truth is Ray and the ""girl"" had no chemistry. Ray is a good kid while the ""girl"" is crazy and is a daughter of a fundie leader. Not a good match.The fight scene reminded me of She Hulk vs Hulk fight. Sadly, this movie did it a lot better minus no cgi and technology.Highlight: Realizing Kevin also played Sabastian Shaw in X-men First Class.The theme song was catchy too. Almost made me want to get jiggy with it.The 3rd Rock slapIs this movie worthy?: NahDo any worthless Mutts appear in this film? No. Awesome!Main Intelligence? 2. The youth are a like house flies.

Footloose,Pleasant youth musical that is entertaining from start to finish.

Footloose,"""Ren"" (Kevin Bacon) moves from the big city to a small town run by the rather puritanical preacher ""Moore"" (John Lithgow) only to find that dancing, singing - indeed just about every form of entertainment has been banished. He claims that is to protect them and their children from ungodly corrupting influences. The new boy is treated with enough circumspection before ""Ariel"" (Lori Singer) takes a shine to him, but once it's known that the daughter of the town bible-basher is having a romance with the disruptive influence, then battle lines are drawn. It's fair too say that ""Ren"" hasn't his problems to seek finding and keeping work and with the local lads who resent his cool, James Dean, style attitude. Things come to an head when he proposes at a town council meeting that the ban be lifted so that they can get a bit ""Footloose"". The drama here is as good as it's contemporaries like ""Flashdance"" (1983) and enjoyably builds on the craze that was probably started with and perpetuated by ""Fame"" (and it's ""Kids"") but the acting is all pretty mediocre, as the dialogue. It's essentially a film about a soundtrack - and there are plenty of songs here beginning with the title song then ""Let's Hear it for the Boy"" and Bonnie Tyler's ""Holding Out for a Hero"" amongst those complementing an underscore of AOR and some energetic dance moves from both Bacon and Singer. It was an huge film at the time and made many a reputation, but time has rather neutered that novelty and now it's a film I'd rather listen to than watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Worth a watch for some early 80s performances,"Not a great movie by any means but as one reviewer said - it is like an 80s musical.Some parts of the movie still hold up well and have relevance.Above all, it is worth watching for some good performances by Kevin Bacon, John Lithgow and an early look at Chris Penn and Sarah Jessica Parker. Dianne Weist is very good as well.In some ways, this is your typical 80s high school movie - which Hollywood made a million of for some reason at this time.It is really a breakout vehicle for Bacon, who handles a difficult role exceptionally well. If he fails, the movie fails. But he holds it together - not an easy job by any means.Chris Penn makes a big impression early though he has to play to the script a little bit - he has to play the supporting role to Bacon and isn't allowed to overshadow him. I think the movie would have been better if Penn was allowed to stretch his wings more and be treated as more of aj equal but that's not what the script calls for.There are some interesting political overtones that still have a lot of meaning today with parts of our history that seemed in the past having a resurgence.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

At least it's better than 'Flashdance',"Back in 1984, when 'Footloose' came out, dance movies were very popular. After the success of 1970's productions, like 'Saturday Night Fever', everyone was trying to get some in the 1980's. That's where the problem began. Every dance movie that came out, you already knew what was going to happen, what is it about, etc. And with 'Footloose', is no different.This movie tells the story of Ren McCormack (Kevin Bacon), a boy from Chicago that moves to a small town. There, while falling in love with the Reverend's daughter (Lori Singer), he finds out that there is a law against dancing in this town(!), now he tries to organize a dancing ball for his class and fights against his law. From this, you already know what's going to happen, and it's really boring. The plot is really absurd, if it was set in the 1950's, it would be believable. At least the movie has a few sub-plots, but none of them is interesting or gets your attention, they are all cliché and predictable.By in the middle of it, I kept thinking ""If this a dance movie, why a plot? What about the dancing?"". And that's where lies the problem of the movie. A dance movie with no dancing! The soundtrack is excellent with great original songs like 'Footloose' and 'Let's hear it from the boy', but you don't get to see anyone dancing in the most of the movie. Instead, what you get are bad-made dialogs and a non-believable story.The acting here is ridiculous. Kevin Bacon looks more like a gay alien and nothing else, and Lori Singer isn't beautiful at all. Thankfully, the movie has John Lithgow and Dianne Wiest, and they really saved the movie. They are both excellent as the Reverend and his wife. The other aspects aren't even worth mentioning, but Herbert Ross' directing really bothered me with close-ups of people's feet.Overral, this is a really bad dance movie. The direction bothers you, and the two leads don't act their ways out. But the nice soundtrack and original songs, as well as John Lithgow and Dianne Wiest made the movie watchable. It's better then 'Flashdance', what doesn't say much, but it's nothing compared to better dance movies, like 'Saturday Night Fever'3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Superb!,"Loosely based on events that took place in the tiny, rural farming community of Elmore City, Oklahoma... Herbert Ross's 'Footloose' is about a small town where rock-and-roll has been banned. You just can't dance over-there! Boy, It's a superb film... as a viewer, you're highly entertained!'Footloose' is an expression, of how far would you go to make a dream come true. Dean Pitchford screenplay is engaging and Ross's direction is terrific. It has some memorable moments, especially when Bacon dances his guts out or even the penultimate portions that focus on John Lithgow. The soundtrack is foot-tapping, surely 1984 grooved on it!Kevin Bacon is the soul of the film. 'Footloose' explores the dancer and actor inside him. Despite being a highly-talented personality... he has remained under-rated! Sad to know he doesn't have the fan-following that he truly deserves. A special mention to Lithgow, Lori Singer and Dianne Wiest for their flawless performances!'Footloose' is a must watch. It's entertaining, foot-tapping and the now-veteran Bacon to keep you glued. Two Thumbs Up!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Kick off your Sunday shoes!,"It wasn't until just the night after first watching Kevin Bacon's very first movie, Animal House, this past May, I first watched the movie that made him famous, Footloose. In fact, just tonight, I watched it again, and I gotta say, it's cheesy, but really enjoyable.Footloose tells the story of Ren McCormack (played by Kevin Bacon), a teenager from Chicago, who just moved to the small town of Bomont with his mother Ethel (Frances Lee McCain), to live with his aunt and uncle. Ren is appalled to quickly learn that his two favorite things in the world, those being rock music and dancing, have been outlawed in this town that he now calls home. As he tries to fit in with the locals, Ren faces an uphill battle to put an end to this injust ban. Backed by his new best friend Willard Hewitt (Christopher Penn), and rebellious teen girl Ariel Moore (Lori Singer), whom he develops a crush on, he just might be able to loosen up this town full of people with sticks up their butts, and show them that dancing is one of the best things in the world. But Ariel's killjoy father, the overly strict, influential Reverend Shaw Moore (John Lithgow), stands in the way.So yeah, you get the gist. A town where dancing is illegal, one boy wants to make a difference. Cheesy? I know. But Dean Pitchford's script manages to take this somewhat trite concept and do some pretty great things with it that make it work. There's some great, clever humor sprinkled through this movie, especially the exchange between Ren and Willard when Ren asks him about his musical tastes. The movie also showcases some exciting moments, like Ren's iconic, fuming dance in the warehouse, and the game of chicken atop tractors. And indeed, the movie also includes some heartwarming moments, particularly between Ren and Ariel.The acting is great, too! Kevin Bacon successfully elevates the new-kid-in-school archetype, by supplying Ren with a certain amount of slick charm and onscreen presence, that carried into the majority of his work afterward. That, AND he's one hell of a dancer! Lori Singer imbues Ariel with a certain spunk and defiance that fits her so well. John Lithgow is terrific as Reverend Shaw, and really helps to showcase that despite his fundamentally religious nature, he does care very deeply about his family and congregation. And Christopher Penn is pretty fun and goofy as Willard.And finally, the thing that most people would probably recognize Footloose for: the music. This movie does include a very good, tender, plaintive score by Miles Goodman (may he rest in peace), that's mostly relegated to the very lowkey scenes. But more importantly, the movie offers a fantastic mixtape of awesome 80's rock songs co-written by Pitchford specially for the movie, such as ""Holding Out for a Hero"" by Bonnie Tyler, ""Let's Hear It for the Boy"" by Deniece Williams, and for Ren's warehouse dance, ""Never"" by Moving Pictures. Special mention goes to two particularly good Kenny Loggins songs, ""I'm Free (Heaven Helps the Man)"" and of course, the title song, ""Footloose"", both of which really reflect the movie's premise.Everything considered, Footloose is inevitably dragged down by its cheesy plot, but ultimately, the writing, acting and music help to redeem it, and make it both a really good star-making role for Kevin Bacon, and a movie anybody who loves rock music, like myself, can enjoy. So, if you like 1980's teen flicks, give Footloose a chance!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Very Strange Dancing,"I wanted to see an early Kevin Bacon film to compare to his 'City on a Hill' performance. This was on Showtime so revisited it. Don't recall my reaction then but it doesn't stand the test of time, or maybe needs even more time. What is that strange dancing Bacon does? He's a gymnast but that doesn't explain his gyrations in the abandoned building. And what kids ever danced like that at the prom - don't get it. But it was fun to see Sarah Jessica Parker and Christopher Penn and Bacon in one of their early films. Bacon does have that special way of walking - John Wayne, step aside!",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Terrific 80s flick!,"This film boasts outstanding performances by Kevin Bacon and John Lithgow, a plausible plot (certainly more plausible than the plot in Flashdance!) and great 80s music! I love the fact that while the Kevin Bacon character was a rebel, he stood up for what he felt was right and did so in a non-violent way. Also the way the adults, especially the Lithgow character, were treated with sympathy and respect. I love the scene where the Kevin Bacon character teaches the Chris Penn character to dance to the tune of ""Let's Hear It For The Boy""!",,Anonymous,Music
Let's Hear It For The Boy...,"Footloose is the quintessential 80s movie! It was the very first cassette tape I ever owned as a young person. In a way, it was the soundtrack of my childhood. Watching it again for the first time since I was young was very interesting. It has a really good premise, but wasn't really flushed out that well. In true 80s fashion, it spends a long time on gratuitous musical sequences which are well done, but don't support the story that well. This forces them to smash the entire substance of the plot into the last act. I had the fortune of directing the stage musical a few years ago, and while the script has some problems, it does fully imagine the great concept in a way the movie never could. The film still holds up as a classic for several reasons. I mentioned the concept and soundtrack which are the defining factors, but it also made Kevin Bacon a huge star, introduced us to Chris Penn & Sarah Jessica Parker, and gave us a bird's eye view of exactly how talented an actor John Lithgow is. We wouldn't fully realize that until after his string of comedic turns. It would take many years for him to jump back into real drama again. In spite of it not being the perfect film, Footloose will always live in my heart as a defining moment of my childhood, and I will continue to unabashedly love it for what it is.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Good 80s film,"Good 80s film. I think the reason why it never captivated me is the music pure and simple. With musicals, one has to like the music being played because the music is as important as the overall message. Phantom of the Opera is a great example, you can't dig the story if the music doesn't grab you. The music in Footloose never got me so I didn't enjoy the musical numbers. Many musicals can be corny while still having remarkable elements to them. I do, however know that so many DID find this remarkable. I have friends who are Footloose purists. In my case, It's not that I liked it and then changed my mind, it's that I never liked it at all. The movie really bored me at times and I found a lot of it cheesy yet I could still appreciate the underlying theme of it all. I think a 7 is an appropriate rating for Footloose, I'd never rank it below average because I do not think it could be considered dreadful.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Teen Rebellion and Killer Tunes From the Heart of the '80s,"Hip teen Kevin Bacon moves from the big city to a podunk town in the sticks, where he's shocked to learn that dancing has been forbidden. The absurd legal prohibition frustrates his fellow high schoolers, but they find other ways to act out. Particularly Ariel, the preacher's daughter, a would-be angel who rebels against her ultra-conservative upbringing by sleeping around and risking her life in a string of dumb stunts. Bacon's boundless confidence and earnest manner nets him plenty of friends around the school, and the romantic attentions of Ariel, but also waves red flags in the community. Doubly so when he speaks out at a council meeting and organizes a senior prom, complete with rock music and dancing, at a grain mill just outside city limits.This one kept surprising me. It skips most traps of the silly, stereotypical '80s high school comedy and delivers an impressively thoughtful, level-headed take on the generational divide. Bacon's character is a smart, personable, even-tempered sort who has no trouble forming lasting friendships and possesses the self-assurance to call out his peers when they posture and front. He pushes his friends to grow and his opponents to think again, shows maturity in tough situations and, darn it, he really, really loves to dance. Intense, precise, balletic dancing. Especially when he's all charged up with adolescent rage in an abandoned warehouse. Even the hard line preacher / councilman (John Lithgow), driving force behind the city's anti-dance crusade, is afforded a layered, sympathetic back story. I wasn't prepared for so much impartiality in a music-driven PG comedy from the heart of the '80s.While its tempo is up, Footloose is a refreshing change of pace for an era that was flush with shallow screwball sitcoms. Though it provides an easy conflict, a catchy pop soundtrack and an embarrassment of montages, just like many of those contemporaries, its cast is less clichéd and more human. Most of the third act lingers in self-pity, an excessive drag, but it rebounds in time for the big finale and hits the credits at just the right time. Much better than I expected.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Good 80's film,"Good 80's movie. The concept is an anachronism which feels contrived from the get go; the film's heart and characters belong in the 1950s, but they have been made to look and talk like greasers circa the 1980s. If not for a heartfelt, balanced performance from John Lithgow as the preacher, and sympathetic turns from Lori Singer as his daughter, Bacon in the lead, and a wonderful Chris Penn as Bacon's new pal, the film probably wouldn't have worked at all. With its predictable plot developments, this is touch and go all along. It never quite feels like director Herbert Ross (The Goodbye Girl, California Suite) is in touch with the youth culture he tries to convey. Still, the story has a sweetness to it that makes it very hard to dislike.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

The plot is a wonderful struggle of someone who doesn't fit in meeting other people that don't necessarily fit in and attempting to make a difference in the world. Great characters and a great story make this great and all but you remember it for one reason: The Music. Footloose is not by any means a musical, but you could almost consider it one.

Idiotic rethinking of the Hollywood Musical, with old-fashioned trimmings knocking boots with music video-styled rock and roll interludes. The cast just goes through the motions, though Chris Penn's learning-to-dance montage is very cheerful (it's hearty enough to wake the audience out of its slumber). *1/2 from ****",3.0,Anonymous,Music

The Boy Who Dances Away Oppression,"There's no denying 'Footloose' left a mark. Likable dance scenes, big soundtrack and a star turn for actor Kevin Bacon. These things elevate a slightly cheesy story that has the usual tropes - boy/girl romance, spurred villain, happy go lucky ending - as part of it's package. That doesn't mean you can't admit the tale is hokey as hell.Ren McCormack (Kevin Bacon) moves from Chicago with his mom to middle of nowhere West Virginia. There he encounters a strict ban on dancing and the town authorities distaste for perverse music, literature because kids died in an car accident years ago. Ren fights this way of thinking, but also his outsider status while gaining the eye of preacher's daughter Ariel (Lori Singer). Reverend Shaw (John Lithgow) can feel, see his control slipping away in more ways than one.Lithgow is saddled with a typical adult role in an contraption of this sort, but genuine acting makes the Reverend's change, growth feel nature & organic. Bacon is the best, but that's also no shock. Given a character that thru dialog and action never makes a misstep taking up the fight with the wrong person. Dianne Wiest, Chris Penn & Sarah Jessica Parker all have earlier roles and individual moments to shine. Lastly timeless tracks from the likes of Kenny Loggins, Bonnie Tyler, Deniece Williams and Mike Reno & Ann Wilson.'Footloose' isn't great and not horrible leaving it squarely somewhere in the middle. Best not to think too deeply about it and just sit back, enjoy the Kenny Loggins tracks, launching pad for Kevin Bacon and a spread of 80's cheesiness. A Hollywood bankrupt for fresh ideas did a remake later, but no way it can surpass the breezy charms found here.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
MasterPiece!,This movie is one of the greatest films I've ever seen! I mean hey it's kind of like a chick flick but it is truly a masterpiece. It really smoked that stupid pointless remake that couldn't hold a simple storyline. This movie deserves to be looked at more seriously though because it really shows how cool it was to be a teenager in the 80s. R.I.P. to the 80's that'll never happen again. If you want to experience a nice cool breeze of the 80's that says welcome back this is the movie to see. Overall the film is always something to look back on and how classic it really is. The remake forget about it. It's just like another Psycho remake which sucks just as bad and this one's remake. I have to give this film a full 10 out of 10 because it'd be a crime not to.,,Anonymous,Music
Good 80's flick,Bacon was exceptionally believable in the part and handled everything from the dramatic scenes to the lighter ones. Even his dancing hits the high marks. Lori Singer doesn't come close to matching him but she makes for a nice supporting player in the role of the girlfriend. Lithgow is his typical entertaining self and it's nice seeing Wiest even though her role is terribly underwritten. Another big thumbs up has to go to Christopher Penn in his role of the redneck who doesn't know how to dance. Another major factor to the film's success is the terrific soundtrack including the hit title track by Kenny Loggins. I'm not sure why anyone would go into FOOTLOOSE expecting some sort of art picture.,6.0,Anonymous,Music

An Honest Review,"It's still one of my favorites and I could hardly walk when it first came out.And now it's legend, so writing a real review is almost needless. Just about everyone has seen it. It's still regarded as a classic.So I suppose the best thing to say is that it's like the Karate Kid...only with dancing rather than martial arts.Single mother and son move into a new town.
Son is an outsider that gets in trouble with the local bully.
Son starts dating the local bully's girlfriend.
Son and bully fight and...resolution.However, it goes a bit deeper in that it references several cases of high school kids actually taking on town ordinances against dancing.And Kevin Bacon is the new kid in town, so he's like the Karate Kid, but he also serves in the Pat Morita role as instructor.And the evil dojo is actually a church and the bad guy is actually a preacher and not a Karate trainer and has a very kind heart and cares a lot for his community. So the main villain isn't really evil he just has a different point of view, and unlike movies today, he is allowed to have a different point of view, to really be wrong in his beliefs, and still be portrayed as a kind and caring person.So, it's like the Karate Kid only with actual depth and much better soundtrack.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Bacon Is Served,"I wish I could say that Bacon sizzles in this ""rebellious youth"" tale, but he doesn't. There is a lot of ham on the screen and corn in the flaky dialogue.

When you are the only boy among three girls you get dragged to films like this.,"I spent the night with two of my cousins when I was young. Along with me was my sister so I got dragged to ""Footloose"" and suffice to say I was bored out of my mind! This is just not a film for a nine year old kid and not really for me now either. It is just not a movie that is going to crack my fave films of all time for obvious reasons. The main one being I like to see movies as an escape and when escaping with this film I get to go into a small town where dances and such are not allowed. What fun! Especially considering I live in Alabama in a small town I just have no urge to revisit places like this on the big or small screen. The film does star Kevin Bacon though, and he is not the typical lead in a film such as this so he adds something to the film as does John Lithgow. Though not enough as the rest of the cast is typical of a mindless flick such as this. The premise is bland, the film is bland, that song by Kenny Loggins was kind of catchy though.

The more the town represses the teens, the more they seem to want to rebel & Ren (Bacon), an outsider becomes their leader.Most people like this movie because of Kevin Bacon & the great soundtrack.

Fair dance movie...,"1st watched 7/1/2010 -- 4 out of 10 (Dir-Herbert Ross): Fair dance movie with good music and dancing but underdeveloped storyline(that should have been set in the 1950's) that ruins the whole experience. The movie is about a smalltown that abolishes dancing and a few other things after an accident on a local bridge that killed a few kids including the preacher's son. A young pup, played by Kevin Bacon(in a good role for him, actually) arrives in town from Chicago wanting to change things. The preacher is played by John Lithgow(who does a decent job), and has personal reasons for keeping the law in place. His daughter, played by Lori Singer, in some ways is trying to go against her father but in other ways is trying to reach out to him, but can't seem to since the incident. Singer is not very convincing in her role and she just doesn't match up to the other actors as far as her skill level and this weakens the film. The main problem, though, is a script that's inconsistent. The first half of the movie plays like a few MTV moments and outside of the music it's trying to introduce the distance between the characters. The last half tries to bring the characters back together and has more drama, but each half doesn't do a very good job -- although the 2nd half is better. Sure, there's a nice danceable happy ending but you really don't get a feeling like real changes were made. For a summer kids flick this did well, but for the discerning adult this movie doesn't have much appeal. Buy the soundtrack -- enjoy the music and dance to it, but don't worry with the film.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

Cut Footloose,"Footloose is probably the most overrated and least impressive eighties film I can think of it. Without the music, Kevin Bacon, and the end dance scene, there is nothing memorable or special about this one note film. I can't even put it into a genre. It's not comedy because very few moments are funny. It's not a drama because it is too goofy to be one. And it's not a musical because there is no singing. This could very well fit the ""miscellaneous"" section in any film category.Kevin Bacon plays sweet and simple Ren. Ren moves with his mother from Chicago to the small rural town of Bomont. Upon learning that things are much more uptight in the town, he also comes to discover that rock music and dancing is banned. This is because Reverend Shaw Moore (Lithgow) believes that is nothing but a troublemaking nuisance. Ariel (Singer), the Reverend's daughter, begins to catch the eye of Ren so now he has two things on his plate.The main problem is Footloose tries too hard to leave a mark on the eighties fabric and just ends up being a hodge podge of different things. For one, it's a movie that focuses on a serious issue, the banning of music. But its comical characters and poorly written script dumb it down. The film, also, breaks out into dance sessions with no explanation other than to showcase its soundtrack.The soundtrack is pleasant to listen to. It's filled with great tunes from back in the day. Including the title song by Kenny Loggins, a favorite of mine. Another thing is tries to be is an awkward love story between the Reverend's daughter and Ren. The Reverend's daughter can be sweet and sincere, but she's not the brightest bulb because she does the impossible and stands on the edge of two cars while a semi comes closer and closer. That's intelligent.Footloose is harmless because it doesn't offend anyone. No one will take anything to heart, except the fact I think this film is a case of ""talked about too much, resulting in too little."" There is enough here to sustain a movie, but everything is taken in such an awkward, one dimensional manor that it's hard to like.Some people will be able to find the humor, the drama, and the fun in Footloose and that's great. Unfortunately, because the film is such a mixture of various genres that are all done in an incomplete manor I doubt that will be an easy thing to do. I wonder if Kevin Bacon had been replaced with someone, unknown, like C. Thomas Howell and if the music had been less common, but still boasted the same topic and same name if it would've been half as popular as this is.Starring: Kevin Bacon, John Lithgow, Lori Singer, and Dianne Wiest.

Harmless 80s fun,"So dancing has been banned which makes no sense, neither does a chicken race at walking pace but that's not what your paying your money for. This is a prime slice of 80s feel good cheese and thus little thought should be given to reality. This movie did not set out to break box office records or win Oscars which granted shows although if your watching an 80s film about dancing with these expectations I suggest you stop drinking. Aside from this the part where Willard learns to dance is worthy of an academy award, without that scene I doubt I would be the great ballet dancer I am today. I find his robot particularly inspiring.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Big holes...,"The opening credits of ""Footloose"" are a blast. The camera shoots the feet of several people doing different dance steps while a catchy music plays on the back. There's a chance you miss the credits because the movement of the feet may distract you; I think that's effective. I also think the first ten minutes of the film are effective: with the camera showing different views of what's clearly a small town and then taking us to church, where Reverend Moore (John Lithgow) gives a speech about how dancing corrupts the spirit of young children.When the mass is over, we see the Reverend's beautiful daughter Ariel (Lori Singer) and her friends in a car racing tough guy Chuck's van (Jim Youngs), and unexpectedly Ariel gets out of the car through the window and stands in the middle of the two vehicles, knowing that a truck is coming from the other side. She doesn't die, but we understand the movie makes a statement: a girl is angry at her father because he is forbidding freedom among teenagers, and controls her all the time and doesn't let her live her life.This is not an unfamiliar plot line, and although it's interesting, the movie provides something more interesting yet: Ren McCormack. Played by Kevin Bacon with the enough amount of cockiness and the necessary humanity, Ren is the new guy in this little town and he's about to bring trouble because he dances well and he wants everyone to dance. However, that's as interesting as it gets.I won't tell you anything else about the plot because I believe everybody needs to experience a film in their own way and draw their own conclusions, but I have to tell you that my experience of ""Footloose"" was a disappointing one. Yes, there's good music and choreographies, and Kevin Bacon's work is risky and worthy of admiration (so is Chris Penn's as his best friend Willard), but there's absolutely nothing more.As we wait for a new song to start playing, direct Herbet Ross struggles to keep our attention and cover the big holes in Dean Pitchford's script (there are moments where this is impossible and we're stuck with excessive minutes of background music). Take any conversation, any situation; only one is enough to see how narrow-minded Pitchford's writing is. And it's not narrow-minded because the characters inhabit a narrow-minded little town: it's narrow-minded in its nature, and it makes it impossible to us to connect with any of the characters or even remember their names (try to remember the name of Ren's mother by the end of the movie). Matsan asked me one time about the name of a guy that appears a lot in the film, but it seems more an accessory than a character.After one day in school, Ren is driving the streets with a bunch of guys we don't care about. Okay, maybe we shouldn't, but the script's greatest fault is failing in the development of the one character we should at least relate to. If you think about an instant reason for Ren and his mother to be in a new town, you won't find it. And the movie provides reasons for this situation and many others, but it does it during the wrong moments. Every time an honest confession comes out of a character's mouth, we're not ready for it and we're not able to fully digest it.I felt there was a problem of connection between each scene; that everything was either moving too fast or moving in an unexpected way, like the confession. Sometimes the unexpected is good: not here.You seeSatine had feelings, she was trapped in a situation and we felt for her (this is ""Moulin Rouge!""); Roxie Hart had aspirations, dreams (this is ""Chicago""). Ren McCormack apparently has all this things too, but when the film gives him the possibility to stand by them, two times; the first one he's not convincing enough and the second one the movie skips the scene.Of course you could say it's a musical and the story is less important and not to be taken seriously and other things, and that's why I put the examples above; but this is partly. The fact is, and this can be denied because it's something patent throughout the film, that the story of ""Footloose"" and the emotions of the characters are filled with seriousness: it's the filmmakers' intention for us to take it seriously.And if that's not so, then I've seen another movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

A Good But  Severely Underrated Film,"Footloose is a good film period! I was 12 years old when Footloose came out and watched this one several times throughout my teen years. I still liked this film after re-watching it as an adult.This seems to be a movie you either hate or love with very little in-between reviews or thoughts on the movie. I think it's rated way to low on IMDb.Maybe some people really don't get the message of the movie?! There are real-life people that think all rock music should be banned - that is reality! Some people really do feel that rock music is a bad influence and want ALL OF THE YOUTH - in particular their own kids - to be influenced by other things: religion, country music and living, classical music or anything else they can come up with. And it's the same with the joy of dancing - some people find dancing to be outright vulgar and want others to stop dancing! YES this film is based on reality!Maybe the people that dislikes this film so much sides with the idea of ""NO ROCK MUSIC"" thus, hated the *idea* that Ren McCormack (Kevin Bacon) brought rock-music back to the town as well as the pleasurable activity of dancing.Maybe some people just dislike Kevin Bacon and will bash everything he does - including this movie - instead of judging each of his works by merit. (I've personally known people that dislike Bacon and has bashed him for everything).Yes folks, there still are people in the world that think that all rock music and dancing should be banned for their own reasons.

Stop being cynical and just enjoy it for what it is,"When you hear the premise of ""Footloose"", it's easy to assume that it will be filled with broad cartoon characters, but it isn't. A town where dancing is outlawed?! What kind of madness, is this? I actually found that despite the somewhat contrived premise, the movie really works as a way of showing how dancing is a liberating experience. The main cast is well developed and we can sympathize and understand who they are as they experience growth and change. The dance sequences are full of energy and will make you want to get up and imitate Kevin Bacon's fast feet, while the music and dialog are sure to make you remember what it was like to be a teen in the 80's (or just a teen in general). I also really admired the film's attempt to have its characters solve problems in an intelligent way. A lot of the teenage rebellion movies I've seen go for either a comical resolution, or an overly sappy one, but it's neither here. The rebellion consists of debate and talking, instead of vandalizing and violence. I did have a problem with a scene towards the end that doesn't follow with the non-violent approach, but otherwise I felt like it did try to make a movie about teenage rebellion that has a brain. I think it's very much a product of its time, and it works because watching it today, it is kind of dated, but in a good way, in a way that's simpler than today's overly cynical views. ""Footloose"" isn't perfect but it's a great time at the movies. (Theatrical version on the big screen, August 15, 2012)",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Great Music, Great Direction, Great Dancing","I enjoyed it in 1984 when it came out and I enjoyed it 24 years later, watching it on DVD. As soon as I finished watching the movie again, I watched it again with Kevin Bacon's commentary and then again with the commentary of the writer and producer.Most of the commentary is just of the he/she is really great variety. However, there are a couple of amazing revelations. First, Herbert Ross, the director, had to fight for Kevin Bacon against the studio. Apparently, Tom Cruise was scheduled to star, but there was a scheduling conflict. Ross forced Bacon to do a screen test and showed it to the studio execs. If they hadn't come around, he would have walked off the picture and that would have been the end of it. Fortunately, the screen test worked. The second big revelation is that Ross originally had a very low key ending with no real dancing in the final dance sequence. It was only when test audiences gave the film thumbs down that he finally agreed to shoot the upbeat final dance number. Fortunately, he was flexible enough to make the change, so we get a terrific ending and one of the greatest and most fun dance movies of all time.The chemistry between Kevin Bacon and Lori Singer is terrific and Chris Penn and Sarah Jessica Parker are both great in their sidekick, comedian roles. Diane Wiest gets lost, but John Lithgow is amazingly effective as the regressive, but intelligent preacher.Along with Grease and Dirty Dancing, this is one of the three greatest musical/dancing movies of the 1980's.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Musical with a heart!!!!!!!!!!,"If you are looking for a film with a good story then this movie has it, it also has a very good back story which you will start to understand once you start watching the movie. The movie has also got a great soundtrack which mainly consists of pop/rock from the 80's this movie will definitely get you up and dancing.Now lets move on to the main cast roles, We have Kevin Bacon who you will probably remember from Friday 13th Part one if you have see that movie. Kevin Bacon has actually been in quite a lot of good movies and i will have to say that Footloose really did suit him at the time if you want great acting, good story and one hell of a rockin soundtrack then Footloose is the one for you ENJOY!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Bacon,"I seen the play, Got the sound track. Kevin Bacon is so good. He is so good looking. He is a good dancer. Kenny Loggins is a real good song writer. I have other songs from him , from 2 other sound tracks.I like it so much that, ever time its on i watch it over and over again. I like the music that the movie had in it. This movie is fun to watch. I like it because of 1. Bacon 2. Kenny Loggins 3. its a chick movie. Most people don't like chick movies but i do. Bacon has a good person. Its in the county so not that much people knows bout the little things. Well i think that people that are into that whole faith thing will like this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
One of my favorite movies growing up,"As a toddler I remember watching Footloose every chance I got. The storyline, soundtrack and chrography are all good.

"""Almost Paradise""","The 80s is probably the best decade for dance-musicals, and teen flicks.
It never fails me.
These films really make me feel all the worlds wormth, and emotion🖤I actually downloaded the film only because of its song (Almost Paradise) -which is one of my favs-, and I watched it without any expectations... then it lighthearted me.The film has some really great actors, and undoubtedly the greatest soundtracks, and song choices.I'm just gonna give it 8 out of 10 because today I'm turnin' it loose.. footloose💗",8.0,Anonymous,Music
The best movie ever!,"This is one of my all time favourite movies. Yes its cheesy, yes its got a great eighties soundtrack and yes I have it on DVD, VIDEO and the soundtrack! I grew up loving Kevin Bacon forever, this film is just brilliant! So it may have killed his career for a few years- but he's back now and hopefully looking back at Footloose with fond memories! You can't beat the classic eighties movies, Breakfast Club, St Elmo's Fire, Ferris Bullers Day Off etc. and whoever suggested this film should be remade with Justin Timberlake should be shot! You CANNOT re-make a classic, its just wrong.Dirty Dancing 2 for example.....need I say more??!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Iconic.,Classic 80s film. Sure There is some helpings of cheese but the overall core story is excellent. Some religious groups in the USA really need to not take themselves too seriously. The movie is actually based on real events to some extent where some towns in the mid west actually banned their children from dancing. Bacon is good in the part as is John Lithgow as the towns overbearing preacher. A true time capsule of 80s culture and the soundtrack is excellent.,10.0,Anonymous,Music
I'll Sing to You of Silver Swans,How can anyone not like this? It's an 80s classic with lots of memorable lines and scenes and one of the best movie soundtracks of all time. Yes it's cheesy and even stupid at times but the cheese just adds flavor and the stupidity adds...well...yeah whatever man. Anyway this is a fun teen flick back when people pushing thirty played teenagers in movies. The way it should be damn it!

Let's hear it for the boy!,"OK, so a town where it's illegal to dance makes no sense, but everything about ""Footloose"" makes it worthwhile. The plot of course has big city boy Ren McCormick (Kevin Bacon) moving to a small town where Rev. Shaw Moore (John Lithgow) has banned dancing, and challenging this. Prior to watching this movie, I'd heard ""Let's Hear It For the Boy"" in a gym class, but I didn't know that it was used in this movie. Also starring are Lori Singer, Frances Lee McCain (the ""Gremlins"" mom), Dianne Wiest, and Chris Penn. All in all, not a masterpiece, but definitely an enjoyable movie.Banning dancing. I mean really. Even the most totalitarian societies in history allowed dancing.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Just watched Collector's Edition four times,"Why did I watch it through four times? First, I wanted to see the movie because I missed it in the 80's. Then I got caught up in all the bonus material, which was better than the movie, and told the exciting story of how the movie was made. I watched through once with Kevin Bacon's commentary and again with the commentary of the producer and the writer. Finally I went back and watched all the dance sequences again with the new knowledge I had acquired. So much fun to learn about the creative process by which this went from being one man's idea to being a cultural phenomenon. So interesting to see all the ways the film was almost scuttled, including the ""wrong ending"" the otherwise savvy director insisted on giving it, and the studio executive who said she would never, never approve of the casting of Kevin Bacon because he was not ****able enough. Imagine the movie without the final dance sequence!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A Great Energetic Movie,"I saw this movie when I was 9. I've always loved to dance, this movie made me want to do just that. In the scene when Wrenn is teaching Willard to dance, great dancing song. And of course at the end- like one of the best dancing songs of the 80's period. The movie just had great acting, a good storyline, and wonderful dancing and lots of energy! One of Kevin Bacon's best performances as an actor, thats good cuz he was young in this movie. It was just one of my favorite movies of all time. Even now when I watch it on TV, almost everyday I always get up and dance. Its such a fun movie. And its about loving something and being determined to get it. A real classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Not your typical kids vs. parents flick,"Let's first admit that this movie is not some deep drama or social commentary. It may have a good message, but it isn't shoved down your throat. In the end it is just a fun movie to watch.Having said that, this is one of my favorite movies because of that good message and, more importantly, because of the way in which it is presented. Countless movies and books have been centered on the basic theme of this movie - namely the intergenerational friction between teens and their parents. Unfortunately, most of them fall into the same trap and paint one (or both) sides as stereotypical in the extreme. Frequently this shows up by having kids that are ultra-clever battling against bumbling adults (Breakfast Club or Ferris Bueller's Day Off - both of which are enjoyable - come immediately to mind, but the list is oh so long). Usually, the kids have no apparent concrete reason to be battling the adults and the adults merely want to be obeyed because they are adults - they don't appear to have any desire to actually do what's best for the kids. In the end, these tales usually have the kids triumphing over the adults.Footloose largely avoids this. At first, it appears that the adults in town are going to turn out to be cardboard cutouts transplanted from all the other movies in the genre, but it quickly turns out that the adults are not evil, nor stupid, nor uncaring. They are genuinely trying to do what they believe is best for their kids - and they realize that they aren't infallible and that they don't have all the answers. In the end they are willing to consider change not because they are convinced the changes are necessarily right, but because they respect and trust their kids.For their part, the kids aren't rebelling just to rebel, nor are they trying to deny their parent's authority even as they struggle against it. Quite the opposite, they largely work within the bounds of the system their parents have set up in their quest to change it - and their parents. They do so because they respect and trust their parents. Furthermore, they are willing to accept defeat when it appears their best efforts didn't win the day.What this film portrays so well is that parents and their children may have different outlooks and priorities and they may come into passionate conflict as a result - but they can do so while the mutual love, trust, and respect endures.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A Great Movie to Dance to.,"I really like this movie because it has such a great soundtrack. It takes me back to my youth in the 1980's. The plot and non-musical scenes are okay to watch. The cast do a good job but the story is rather bland.  The best performannce is is given by John Lithgow as the the preacher. I love the Dvd version for the great reproduction of the songs.  If you like a movie that makes get up and Move your groove thing or want to relieve those fabulous 1980's, than get this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Great Film!,"Footloose is a pretty good film. I thought it's better than what people portray this movie to be. I know that this is not Grease, but it's better than Flashdance. I have wanted to see this film since i went on a sixth grade field trip to see a play based on this film.This film is based on a ridiculous but true story. It's about a town that has banned dancing. But the new kid in town played by an amazing Kevin Bacon is about to defy that rule and get the minister's daughter while he's at it.My favorite scene in the movie is the very beginning when we see all the shoes dance. The soundtrack is really good. I love Kenny Loggins because he performs great music. Also, RIP Chris Penn! You were good in this movie. I rate this film 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Harmless fun and lots of memories,"'Footloose' is harmless fun that brings on a wave of nostalgia any time I see it on cable. I remember seeing this movie at the local multiplex when it was new, loving the music, and loving the rebellion in the film even more. What fourteen year old ""under the thumb of oppressive authority (translation: be home by 11pm, young man!)"" wouldn't love that stuff.I remember that this was the soundtrack everyone had to have that year. And who didn't have ""Almost Paradise"" played at the school dance that year?I remember reading articles in newspapers about the success of this movie. Some said it was a return to making musicals in Hollywood, perhaps overstating and/or misunderstanding the movie's appeal.Of course, watching it now as an adult I can see that it isn't very realisitc, especially when one realizes that most of the issues in this movie would have been easily solved with one well-publicized lawsuit from the ACLU. But hey, I've always maintained that movies are built for entertainment purposes, which gives them the right to suspend reality for an hour or two!",,Anonymous,Music
A Sensitive Classic Featuring John Lithgow,"Those who have not seen this film probably think it's a frivolous teen flick about rock and roll music. Yes, like ""Star Wars"" is merely a western set in space.Speaking of ""Star Wars"", this film---though it does revolve around a conflict between those in power and those who seek freedom from their control---is not populated with characters that are purely good or absolutely evil. Thanks to some wonderful performances and a stellar script, the characters are complex and all of the main characters go through major changes.The one exception to that is the main character, Ren (Kevin Bacon), who changes little throughout. Ren is the new kid in school, a Chicago transplant who comes to an insular farming community and stirs things up. From the beginning he a representation of all that is different, which is why he is a threat to the status quo. At the end of the film, he has changed little, but he has made a significant impression on the entire town.The town authority is primarily represented by Reverend Shaw Moore (John Lithgow), who asks that all abide by biblical strictures and codes of conduct. He is equally hard on himself, considering it his duty to educate and protect the sheep in his flock. Moore's wife (Diane Wiest) is the quiet, dutiful spouse who lives to support her husband.Moore's teen daughter is Ariel (Lori Singer), the prototypical preacher's child, who rebels to demonstrate she is just one of the kids. She is a fearless risk taker who lives too close to the edge for her own good. (Ariel comes from Hebrew and means ""lion of God"")As with other cinematic outsiders, Ren eventually must confront authority in a formal fashion. (See Howard Hill in ""The Music Man"", who must defend himself before the town's council, or Jim Stark in ""Rebel Without a Cause"" who is hauled into the police department, or coach Norman Dale in ""Hoosiers"", who has to argue that he not be fired in a town meeting that takes place in a church) In a meeting of the town council, Ren argues they should overturn a law that criminalizes dancing.We learn that there are reasons for that restrictive law, but at the heart of the matter is fear. Ren argues that the costs of protecting the community can be greater than the risks they are being protected from. (As I write this, the coronavirus pandemic has a grip on the world, and some are making the same argument as Ren.)So why does this film deserve more than, say, a ""7"" besides the universal themes mentioned so far? Because the characters have depth and nuance. Lori Singer might be only a bratty teen to some viewers, but watch her as she changes throughout the film, especially when she deals with her father. Her face says more than her words. Likewise, Diane Wiest, as the preacher's wife, expresses so much in the pauses between her words, though eventually she finds the words to tell her husband that faith is about freedom, not control.Reverend Moore undergoes the greatest changes as Ren challenges their way of life, forcing him to better define his principles. Is this the same actor that plays the zany Dick Solomon on ""Third Rock from the Sun""? John Lithgow has an incredible range.All of these characters are likable. And there are others who add comedic and dramatic depth, like Chris Penn, who plays Willard, Ren's unlikely farmer sidekick, who has to learn how to dance (just a Penn did in real life for this role). And Sarah Jessica Parker as Rusty, Willard's girlfriend, whose enthusiasm helps make us believe these really are teens, though some actors are well past twenty.Dean Pitchford's script is based upon a true story. And it contains some wonderful lines. It also includes some clever commentary, like when the town's self-righteous rumor monger, Roger Dunbar, rails about filthy books and cites ""Tom Sawyer"" as a ""real classic"", not realizing that the book was banned by many librarians.Musically, the film is blessed with some real toe tappers, including the eponymous creation by Kenny Loggins. And the dancing truly is representative of the freedom and the joy music can inspire.You can enjoy this film as a bouncy teen romance. Or you can view it as a commentary on well-intentioned despotism. Either way, this is a well-constructed, enjoyable film.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Good movie with upbeat soundtrack,"""Footloose"" is the movie that jettisoned Kevin Bacon into stardom by his boyish charisma and the upbeat dance moves.PLOT: However, this is not a hackeyed musical that doesn't give the starring roles a chance to dance and/or burst into song. It's a mainly serious drama about a Chicago teen (Kevin Bacon) who moves into a town where dancing/rock music is banned, thanks to a pastor (John Lithgow, of ""Third Rock From the Sun"" fame). Infuriated, he decides to rebel and make dancing and rock music legal, when he is helped by new friend (Christopher Penn) and the pastor's rebellious daughter (Lori Singer).REVIEW: ""Footloose"" is a minor, simple story that, without the dancing and musical interludes, would probably be an unsavory and stuffy drama. But, the charming performances by Bacon and Singer (note that ""Sex and the City"" goddess Sarah Jessica Parker in a minor role as Singer's helpful friend) and the upbeat rock and dance sequences make it a light and entertaining drama/musical. It's also helped by a nice ending that the pastor finally understands why his daughter is so rebellious and decides to make things right.REASONS FOR PG RATING: Four-letter words. Graituitous male shower scene with plenty of nudity. Some violence, only mild and non-gory.RATING: **1/2 out of **** stars.",,Anonymous,Music

One word for this movie....TRIFLING!!!,"Who allowed this piece of junk to get out of the studios. What a terrible story line. Check it- a mad preacher who passes such laws to control music, taking the blame off the parents' sorry job raising these kids and placing the blame on song and dance. Well I'll tell you what, the preacher character was right to band this music- the soundtrack is awful. The dances in this movie were down right CORNY! How could you embarass yourself- no one was on beat (well, what beat- can't really dance to the music in this movie). Anyway this one of those movies I'm sure Kevin Bacon and Sarha J.P. would love to forget.... probably already have. Take this movie out back and shoot it!!! No stars for this flick.",,Anonymous,Music
Fun teen movie,"Kevin Bacon is ""Footloose"" in this 1984 film which also stars John Lithgow, Dianne Wiest, Lori Singer, and Chris Penn. Bacon is Ren, the new kid in a town that doesn't allow dancing, and he sets out to change that.That's actually about all there is to the plot, except that Ren gets involved with pretty Ariel, the daughter of the preacher (John Lithgow). Ariel likes to play chicken with things like trains and cars. In fact, all these kids have hormones, impulses, and energy that are in desperate need of an outlet.""Footloose"" has one of the best soundtracks ever, and some wonderful dancing. Despite its serious moments, it has a relentlessly upbeat and exuberant feel to it.Herb Ross directed; originally, it was supposed to be Michael Cimino. It certainly would have been a different film with him directing. Take ""Footloose"" for what it is, don't ask for ""Citizen Kane,"" and you'll love it.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
You can relate to this movie.,"This movie is a great movie.  I don't know about anybody else, but I can really relate to it.  I moved from a big city, Ft.

Smells like teen spirit,"Although I laughed very much during some of the most gymnastic dance-scenes, I still loved the film. We who grew up in the late 70this and early 80this remember a modern time, but without PCs and play stations.It was a time of music, video-arcades and fun. The soundtrack from Footloose sucks up memories from the past long forgotten.Footloose is really about breaking free from conservatism. Dance, and celebrate life. The youth sensed the time. Cold war. The economic developments. Ecological issues. The increasing pressure to succeed. Being allowed to kick loose and just have fun was a way to express ourselves.For me its a quick trip back to my youth. The only difference is that the actors are much better looking than I was. And I had only my parents to lure,not a reverend to.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Kenny Loggins Birthday is January 7th,"In all aspects of life, no matter what decade or century it is, there always is that tension and argument between the old world thinkers and the new world thinkers. You will probably always disagree about certain things with your parents, with a completely different viewpoint and likewise, your children will do the same to you. It's totally normal. Each generation learns from the mistakes from the ones before it. It's not to say that older generations are wrong. It's just a fact that there needs to be a dialogue between old and new perspectives. In the case of Footloose, this applies to the world of dance and if dancing turns teenagers into deviant drunks. So, there you have it. It is a movie about music/dancing and it is a movie about opinions and morals.In the small mid-western town of Bomont (a fictional town, in a state not mentioned in the film or in the plot), a teenager was killed five years before, while driving home after a night of dancing. The plot of this film is loosely based on events that happened in Elmore City, Oklahoma, but it was shot in parts of Utah. So, that gives you a reasonable idea of how mid-western this story is. In typical style, reminiscent of knee-jerk reactions, seen in other parts of the country, the town council of Bomont decides to put a permanent ban on dancing and rock-n-roll music inside the town limits.The film picks up five years later, when our main character, Ren McCormack (Kevin Bacon), from Chicago, along with his Mother, come into town to move in. We come to the conclusion that Ren is a tough teenager from Chicago, who can take care of himself. We also can tell he is a rebel when it comes to the policies of the small mid-western town. We also learn that he is a good dancer. Enter Ariel (Lori Singer), the female, small-town, daughter of the town's minister, who is a perfect complement to Ren's tough Chicago way of thinking. It is through her that Ren finds the strength to eventually challenge the town council about their stance on dancing.The other key part of this film is the music and dancing. This film is a drama. I would not call this a musical, because there is no singing, but it does have many scenes with a lot of dancing. The songs and the soundtrack are perfect for this film. I won't lie and say it hasn't aged or become dated, but those blemishes are minor and this movie is still just as good as it was in 1984. It was beaten up by the critics of the day. It sounds like Roger Ebert (who is one of my heroes), did not like this movie at all back in 1984. But, it was a hit with the general audiences and made a huge 80 million dollars for 1984.The strength of the soundtrack relied heavily on songs. The in-between film score was handled by Miles Goodman, but the hero of the soundtrack fell to Kenny Loggins, who's main title song ""Footloose"" (along with ""Let's Hear It for the Boy"" by Deniece Williams), hit #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and became more famous than the movie itself. You ask someone, ""when was the last time you saw Footloose""? They say, ""Maybe, ten years ago"". You ask them about the last time they heard the Footloose song? They probably would say this morning or last night. Also, other big hits were ""Almost Paradise"", a duet by Ann Wilson and Mike Reno that reached number seven on the Hot 100 and Bonnie Tyler's ""Holding Out for a Hero"".What is so powerful about this movie is the fact that all sides of the issue at hand, in this story, eventually converge to a point of agreement. Something badly missing from the real world. It's a tough road for Ren though, because the first thing he experiences in town, is pretty much, a minor assault from a police officer and a ticket just for playing Quiet Riot in the car stereo. Something unfathomable in the real world. As the story moves along we learn more about Ariel's father, the town minister (John Lithgow), and his wife (Dianne Wiest). They complement each other perfectly just like Ren and Ariel do. The turning point eventually comes from an unlikely source, when Ariel's mother steps up to challenge her husband. It is this aspect of this movie that makes this film great. It's a film that playfully tugs at the human condition and the morals that we all have to struggle with, but has a great mission and many important lessons found at the end. The film depicts that wherever you are in the political/cultural spectrum, people can change and it took a high school kid to show them the way.One other note about this movie. The acting is actually very good. You end up liking Kevin Bacon's Ren and you buy the cool Chicago kid angle. John Lithgow and Dianne Wiest are brilliant. Lithgow's power is just as strong as his compassion and Wiest shows just how much her character is devoted to her husband, even when he is wrong. Director Herbert Ross does a great job of taking all these different ingredients and along with the moral objective of the film, weaves a perfect story that everyone can enjoy.8.7 (B+ Mygrade) = 8 IMDB.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Retro-Heaven for thirty-somethings,"At the moment in Britain we are enduring a retro revival of the 80's. Pop Concerts involving Adam Ant , Howard Jones , ABC and that shining glint of quality , China Crisis will be appearing, to kick off another tour dedicated to the 80's. A time in Britain afflicted by the social/political division of Thatcherism and the decay of  long held values that only confused and discarded the generation that was brought forth  in that era of unemployment and greed.The generation that I myself come from , all wince at the events and the backward motivation of our political & social leadership. Instead we hide in that piece of muscical & cinematic period that somehow expressed our desires , our joy and our hopes.Footloose , a very popular film in 1985 , caught in some respects the mood. The need and joy of partying and dancing , to find some joy from the drab , repressive existance that our Institutions in Britain had planned for us all. Footloose , showed a moment involving the Preacher of what is percieved truth & wisdom as what it actually was ignorance and repression. How wisdom , even from the bible can be manipulated and become a weapon designed not to lift mankind closer to god , but to push that which is pure , into the very arms of evil. The book-burning scene showed the Preacher the folly & error of his ways.Kevin Bacon as the rebellious teenager held the film and Lori Singer was good as the wayward teenager , trying to break free from a Preacher Father who suffocated not only a town but also his own family with his predjudices & beliefs.Footloose had a great soundtrack for 80's lovers , music from  Australia as well as the US. Unfortunately , Kevin Bacon's Wren said his favourite band was Men at Work. None of their music was played.Some brutal ommissions and inappropriate songs & music bogged down the general mood of the film. The film however , had its desired affect for the generation I come from. We have the right to party & have a good time. Regardless of anyone or anything.",,Anonymous,Music
A great story and dance musical,"Of all dance films, ""Footloose"" ranks up there with ""Dirty Dancing."" It is a great film with an excellent Top 40 soundtrack. It was later made into a highly successful Broadway musical. But the story really makes the film a hit.Kevin Bacon is Ren McCormick, a Chicago teenager who moves with his mother to a small Midwestern town called Bomont after his father leaves. Bomont is a conservative, Bible belt community run by Reverend Shaw Moore (John Lithgow). As the new kid, Ren is seen as a rebel and has difficulty fitting in to the straight-laced ways of Bomont, including a ban on dancing. Things get complicated when he takes up with Ariel (Lori Singer), the minister's daughter. Shaw will not hear of this because Ren ""is a troublemaker."" Furthermore, Ren decides the high school should throw a dance, and the town should reverse the no-dancing law! As one can guess, this will be difficult if not impossible. Shaw Moore will do everything in his power to keep the law in place, because dancing ""is a sin."" Amidst this, wife Vi (Dianne Wiest), while supportive of her husband, feels Shaw has drifted away from the family-oriented man he once was, and longs for these days again. Throw in there a humorous subplot involving Willard (Chris Penn), who doesn't know how to dance and befriends Ren. Can Ren convince Shaw Moore and Bomont that a dance will bring not only renewed freedom of expression, but also emotional and spiritual healing?""Footloose"" is a story that could have taken place, as there are some, however few, real-life communities like Bomont. But the testament of the story rests in the lead's ability to do something different: challenge the ways of the church and the town for a chance at a better life. The soundtrack provides excellent support with Pop/Rock, R & B, and slow ballads. Combine the drama and musical genres, and you have one great story for the stage and screen.",,Anonymous,Music
A fun '80s classic,"This eighties classic is centred on Ren McCormick, a teenager from Chicago, who has moved to a small mid-west town with his mother after his parents divorced. He is shocked when he learns that the town council has banned dancing, largely at the behest of the town's minister. Many of the town's adults think dancing, along with popular music and certain books are a menace that lead youngsters to sin... it quickly becomes apparent that the teenagers, including Ariel, the minister's daughter can be fairly wild without dancing. Somewhat inevitably Ren and Ariel grow close, leading to bad feeling with the boy she was dating, and ultimately Ren leads a campaign to allow the kids to have an official school dance.One might think of this as a music/dance film but it is so much more than that. Yes there is lots of enjoyable eighties music and some fun dance scenes but really it is about the characters. Some may be a little cliché, most notably local bad boy who we just know will ultimately be put in his place by our protagonist. Other characters are deeper than expected, the minister is shown to be a good man despite his draconian views on music; we are given a reason that makes it understandable why he would feel the way he does even if we disagree with him. The actors playing the youngsters may be rather old for the characters they play but they do a good job; most obviously Kevin Bacon and Lori Singer as Ren and Ariel, but also from Chris Penn as Ren's friend Willard. Of the 'adults' John Lithgow stands out for his performance as the conflicted minister. The story is fun; as well as providing reasons for the enjoyable dance scenes, the youngsters dance amazingly well considering it is meant to be banned. Surprisingly the most memorable scene doesn't involve dancing... it involves playing chicken in tractors! Overall it may be a little cheesy but it is definitely an '80s teen classic; a must see for fans of the genre.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
This movie accomplished one thing-,"it proved that if you wait long enough, ANYTHING will make it to DVD!The whole set-up for ""Footloose"" is stupid. If you want to see a good Kevin Bacon movie, rent ""Tremors."" If you want to see an okay one, try ""Stir of Echoes."" If you want to shoot for less but not go all the way to the bottom, watch this. The very bottom is reserved, of course, for ""White Water Summer.""Spend the time you'd waste on this cheesy, 1980s-era dance film (which I think was made just to sell the soundtrack, rather than the other way around) doing something worthwhile in comparison: dig a hole, then dig another hole and fill it in with the dirt from the first hole. Repeat until you reach this film's running-time. It's immensely satisfying in comparison to watching this trash.",,Anonymous,Music
Shoes,I like the bit where the small town preacher won't allow dancing,10.0,Anonymous,Music
Fun 80s dance movie,"""Footloose"" is one of those fun movies from the 80s that has a rocking soundtrack and great dancing. The story is about a young man named Ren, played very well by Kevin Bacon, who moves from the big city to a small town where dancing is outlawed. Of course this is absolutely ludicrous to Ren, a guy who enjoys rock music and loves to dance. The law was passed after a group of kids were killed in a car accident after they had been out dancing and drinking.I liked the performance of John Lithgow as Rev. Shaw Moore, the iron-handed preacher with his rousing God-fearing speeches on morality. I had seen him at the Hollywood Bowl in ""My Fair Lady"" this past summer, and he is an excellent actor. There is Ariel, who plays Lithgow's daughter and Ren's romantic love-interest, played by Lori Singer, who secretly rebels against her father. Although, her character annoyed me a bit at the beginning for some unknown reason, she grew on me once she and Ren get to know each other. I also liked Chris Penn as Ren's friend Willard, whom he teaches how to dance.I have a problem with one scene in this movie. Early in the movie, Ariel goes off for a joyride with her friends after church and her boyfriend pulls beside them in his truck on a country road. She manages to climb out of the window as they're driving and she actually balances on both the truck and the car while they're driving side by side! Unless you're an Olympic gymnast, there's NO WAY someone could pull such a stunt. Sure, this scene is meant to show how crazy and rebellious Ariel is, but they could have done a better job in portraying her rebellion. It doesn't move the story along in any way, but despite this unrealistic scene, the rest of the movie was very enjoyable.I liked the quick editing of the dance scenes in the film, it was very much like an MTV music video would have been back in those days. I love the intro of the film with all those legs dancing, a remiscent flashback of what people wore on their feet in those days, high heels with socks, leg warmers, loafers, boots, etc. The scene at the diner where Ariel pops a tape into her stereo and all the kids get down with the music is pure fun, and even a little sexy as well.It has a good message about censorship and religious hypocrisy. During the 80s there were actually people who were rallying against the ""corruption"" of young peoples' morals because of rock music and music videos, so I'm sure this film must have hit home back then. The main message behind Ren's fight against the anti-dancing law wasn't so much about teenage rebellion, but also about the right for people to enjoy life. Without music and dancing, the world would be a dull and lifeless place.A must for 80s film fans!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Cheesy, but absolutely fun!!","Off the bat, I'll admit that 1984's Footloose is pure, thrashy 1980's silliness. And.....I'm completely down for it. The movie holds dear to my soul because it is a big part of my childhood. My sixth-grade class spent a good portion of the year learning the songs, and our class trip was to see a play based on the hit movie in the lovely town of New Hope, Pennsylvania. The music is legitimately fantastic. Pure 80's music, but absolutely delightful songs. Who can resist the urge not to start dancing when the title song performed by Kenny Loggins comes on the radio, or Deneice Williams, ""Let's Hear It for the Boy."" These songs actually went on to be nominated for Academy Awards.No matter how preposterous the plot sounds, it's actually based on a real story. In 1898, the Oklahoma town of Elmore City outlawed dancing. A pastor from a nearby town was quoted saying dancing led to alcohol which would eventually lead to death. The city made national headlines in 1980 when a junior prom was awarded to the town and the city's council overturned the law....just barely. Screenwriter Dean Pritchard became very interested in the story, and did his due diligence with his research. He also wrote the lyrics to many of the original songs. Paramount boarded the film and then Herbert Ross (Weekend at Bernie's) was hired to direct the film.Taking forth the classic theme of rebellion, the film introduces us to Ren McCormick (Kevin Bacon), a city boy who moved from Chicago to the oilfields in the middle of nowhere. He also loves to dance and listen to his rock'n'roll music. But he suffers a serious case of culture shock when he finds out they are banned in his new town. His misery is tested when he meets Ariel (Lori Singer), a very popular but troubled blonde. She is also the daughter of Reverend Shaw (John Lithgow) who came up with the law after his son died in a car crash because of the booze. The two have a troubled relationship, which is why Shaw's wife, Vi (Dianne Wiest) is the mediator. Now then Ren is in town, he is ready to rile up the town and bring back dancing!The performances are solid. Kevin Bacon is your quintessential 80's character. The hairdo, the dancing, the confident teenager and he brings forth plenty of charm as Ren. It looks like he is one amazing dancer, but fun fact! He only did some of the dances as four stunt doubles were used with Bacon. John Lithgow does well as the Bible-thumping minister who is the foil to Bacon's dancing habits. Dianne Wiest, as you may notice with all her roles, is a very soothing presence. As a normal routine for 1980's flicks, keep an eye out for future stars. Such as Sarah Jessica Parker as Ariel's friend and Chris Penn as Ren's friend.This movie may not be the best musical, but it's one of the more memorable ones. I mean who can resist the toe-tapping dance sequences or any of the music really. The movie throws an exorbitant amount of cheese at you and you have to be willing to suck in the cheese. If not, I have a feeling you may not enjoy the movie. Or you may be one of those who abhors dancing.Footloose was a major box office hit and one of the highest-grossing films of 1984. It became a cult classic considering how many people are devoted to it now. It's hard to believe this is based on a true story, but it most certainly is. The music is wonderful and never grows old. The performances are sweet. The script is cheesy, but what else can we expect from a 1980's teen musical. I certainly had a fun time!My Grade: B",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Footloose review,"This movie it set in the town where they can't listen to music. There also super churchy town. When I saw the storyline for this movie I thought it would be good. Turns out I was right this was great. The dancing and music throughout this movie was fun and well down. The church scenes were good. The romance between the two main characters were fantastic. They had a lot of chemistry together. There was lot of drama, fun, dancing, music, church, romance in this movie. It was also set in high school. I highly recommend this movie to everyone no matter the age.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"""Wanna see somethin'?""","I was a senior in high school when Footloose was released. I tripped through the hallways with everyone else singing ""Let's Hear It For The Boy"" because it was on the radio eighty-four thousand times a day. I agree with almost every other reviewer here with the exception of those few who spoke harshly. Cheesy at times? Yes! Never liked Bonnie Tyler. Issues like those can make this film make you squirm a little.However, no other film of my youth has affected me to this day as this one has. What did it? Compare... ""You think I'm small town?"" ""I think Bomont's a small town."" ""I'm going' away...I'm gonna be gone... Wanna see somethin'?"" Listen to the background music as this scene unfolds. The violin, piano and soulful rock guitar are wed beautifully. Miles Goodman adapted the score so I'm giving him credit for this still mega-emotion stirring theme music. Then, as Ren tells the town ""This is our time to dance,"" well, it still brings a tear of joy and hope. And the background music gives Kevin Bacon's character a rock to stand upon as he gives his speech. Then, there are the snowcapped mountains and sweeping farm valleys that drew me in. The kids, the story, the religious oppression (I'm truly from the Bible Belt where there are no snowcapped mountains) and most of the music all make this film one that I will watch until I'm old and gray, and no longer have the strength to say ""I'm gonna be gone."" P.S. My beloved husband won't watch this with me because he can't quit cringing at the 80's music. He's from Seattle.:)",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Classic, and the classic music and love story","""Footloose"" is a seriously confused movie that tries to do three things, and does all of them badly. It wants to tell the story of a conflict in a town, it wants to introduce some flashy teenage characters, and part of the time it wants to be a music video. It's possible that no movie with this many agendas can be good; maybe somebody should have decided, early on, exactly what the movie was supposed to be about. The film tells the story of a Chicago kid named Ren (Kevin Bacon), who has a fashionable haircut and likes to dance. The old fuddies in Bomont have imposed a total ban on rock 'n' roll and dancing. The ban is led by an uptight preacher named Shaw Moore (John Lithgow), who is still grieving because he lost a child in a car wreck five years ago. To the Reverend Moore, dancing and rock lead to booze and drugs. Ren falls in love with the preacher's daughter (Lori Singer). He also has the usual standard showdowns with the locals, including the high school bully. Ren decides what this town needs is a dance. His assignment, should he choose to accept it? As for the music video scenes: On three different occasions, the movie switches gears and goes into prepackaged MTV-type production numbers, with the fancy photography and the flashy quick cuts. These scenes may play well on TV, but they break what little reality the story has, and expose ""Footloose"" as a collection of unrelated ingredients that someone thought would be exploitable. ""Footloose"" makes one huge, inexplicable error with the Lithgow character. It sets him up as an unyielding reactionary, and then lets him change his mind 180 degrees without a word of explanation. In one scene, the preacher's daughter confronts her dad in church and announces she isn't a virgin (the movie never remembers to tell us whether she really is or not). The preacher turns livid, starts to scream, and then is interrupted by news that they're burning books down at the library. In the very next scene, the preacher is arguing against the book burners -- and before long, without any meaningful transitional scenes, he has caved in to the idea of the dance. It's cheating to set up Lithgow as the enemy and then turn him into a friend without a word of explanation. ""Footloose"" was recently brought back to life as a Broadway musical, and it is the music that truly brings this film to life. With numerous hits, including the aforementioned title song, Deniece Williams' ""Let's Hear It For The Boy,"" Mike Reno/Ann Wilson's ""Almost Paradise"" and Bonnie Tyler's ""Holding Out for a Hero"" leading the way. The music, while practically the definition of bubblegum pop, is infection, fun and memorable. Of course, in a movie such as this one the scenes often play out as something closer to music videos including the hilariously campy closing dance scenes.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
One of the Great American Cinema Entries of All Time,"Move over ""redbud"", Footloose is it. It is the epitome of American cinema. It is perfect. Beyond perfect. It is sublime.Religion? Check.Dancing? Check.Small town America? Check.Scriptural interpretation? Check.A movie shot in Utah but supposed to be in Texas or something? Check.Kevin Bacon? Check.Kenny Loggins? Check.A key reality is that this movie is about grief and unprocessed grief. Bacon plays a kid (probably should have been played by Rob Lowe) moving from the big city to a small town. He is an idiot. He goes to school on the first day with a tie. What a loser.And yet, his adherence to unorthodox values shakes up the town, kids who are desparate to experience the fullness of life (as God intended). The town as a whole has unexplored grief. They choose anger and hate and boundaries over confronting what is unprocessed.Kevin Bacon is just a tool of God. Even the pastor in the end reremembers his days as a seminary student, dancing in joy of God and with others. (See Ecclesiastes.)American cinema will be rememebered for this movie.Is it in the same cinematic universe as Dirty Dancing? I wonder.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
An irrepressible delight,"Somehow, and I don't know how, I've never seen this until now.'Footloose' is such a great movie, an all-around classic. It's unbridled fun from start to finish, even with some heavy emotional beats and important social themes at its core. The dance scenes are paramount to that bent, and yet: Nothing emphasizes the spirit of the film more than the early scene in which two farm tractors play chicken while Bonnie Tyler's ""Holding out for a hero"" blares over top.And still, too, the dance and music that is essential to the fun, and which also makes 'Footloose' a little silly, is also central to more serious undertones. Themes are laid bare very quickly of censorship, and suppressing freedoms, that precipitate still more severe acts. Yet we also get a whiff of discussion surrounding the dangers of immoderate indulgence, and youthful recklessness, that lead into some minor emotional weight, too. Similar films from the 80s have been a bit ham-fisted when inserting such morals into their otherwise boisterous stories, but both the writer and director here have worked well to ensure a natural balance between all the disparate elements.I was totally unaware until now of the fantastic cast. Kevin Bacon is the star, sure, but John Lithgow is great at playing villainous characters. It's always a pleasure to watch Dianne Wiest, whose part here possesses an understated yet strong personality. This is quite an iconic feature to mark the film debut of Sarah Jessica Parker, and I've never seen the late Chris Penn look so young before.I expected to enjoy 'Footloose,' but it was even better than I could have hoped all these years later. It's silly, but is anchored by a well-written narrative with important themes at the foundation. For the sheer irreverent playfulness at hand it may not be a total favorite for all viewers, but love it or hate it, this is unarguably a cinematic staple that everyone needs to see at least once.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

FootLoose,"Foot Loose is a film directed by Herbert Ross. It is a film in which we can see the difference of cultures and customs from one that comes from the city, to living in a small town. As mentioned in class, one can use the herocycle represented by Joseph Campbell to explain different steps in a film. To start off, this film represents the idea of not dancing. People are not allowed to dance in the town that young man moved into. He found this to be outrageous and this motivated him to do something about it. At times, of course, he thought about it twice because it could bring him problems. In the beginning of the film, one can see the separation from culture, which falls in the ""crossing the threshold into the unknown"" of the herocycle. One can see the dedication to religion, what seemed right, and what to do to be holy in this town. Throughout the film one can see trials that he faced that determined if he was accepted in this culture or not. For example, one trial that seen is when he races against another guy with trucks. This determined there braveness and manhood, it was determined by who ""chickened out"" and jumped out the truck as they came close to each other in crashing. Another part of the herocycle that I noticed was when he meets ""goddess"". This is interpreted as when he meets a love interest. He starts falling in love with the daughter of the minister of the town. This restricted him even more of his customs and his own culture. In one scene he starts recalling all the episodes he had to face when it dealt with dancing or music. He started getting upset at the customs in the town. Finally one can see the ""Intia"" in the herocycle; this is where he goes from ordinary to a hero, the turning point. He decides to make a difference and let everyone see that there is nothing evil about music or dancing. In one scene, everyone gathers for a meeting in reference to a dance show and here he perceives the role of a hero. Him being the ""new"" kid in town stands up for the class and defends the idea of dancing and the acceptance of a dance show.",,Anonymous,Music
Footloose Archetypal Review,"Archetypal is the original pattern or model from which all things of the same kind are copied or on which they are based; a model or first form (Dictionary.com). Heroes endure a process to understand themselves and other people surrounding them, including friends and family. This process is the hero cycle which is where an individual gains the courage and ability to over continuous obstacles. Footloose made in 1984 is one film which the Hero Cycle theory, created by Joseph Campbell, can be applied. The main character Ren McCormack, played by Kevin Beacon, stirs up a small town in the West, where dancing and playing modern music is illegal. By helping this town and its citizens Ren ends up finding him self and facing his own personal issues.McCormack is an insecure city boy from Chicago who moves into his uncle's house with his mother. His uncle has two daughters which Ren is expected to set a positive influence upon. His initial conflict is with the Reverend Shaw Moore, played by John Lithgow. Five years ago a group of teenagers died in a drinking and driving accident, ultimately leading up the illegalization of dancing. This is Rens ""call to adventure"" the first step of the hero cycle. Confused about this culturally stricken town he begins to the separation stage from his cultures leading to his unhappiness.The next step of the cycle Ren begins to have obstacles and trials thrown in front of him. Being an outsider and unacceptable to the community already set in place Ren has more bullies than friends. One trial is a tractor race. He wins the trial by accident but begins the initiation sequence. It represents a right of passage and also introduces him to a love interest, Arial the reverends daughter, played by Lori Singer.Another trial in the cycle which brings Ren to rock bottom is being kicked off the gymnastic team. He feels defeated and helpless completely aware of the reason for his disposal. He is being discriminated. He has a confrontation with his uncle which pushes him over the edge. Throughout the film he constantly reprimands Ren for causing trouble, saying ""you didn't cause trouble in the city"". He also blames him for his mother losing her job. The scene in which he discusses the situations at hand with his mother is an extremely important scene. His mother believes in him and offers her blessing to do what is necessary for self fulfillment.Rens attempt to save himself and the town is to throw a dance. Since dances are illegal it is up to him to introduce the idea to the town council. At the town meeting Ren is nervous but prepared to make his argument. This is the entering of the final stages of the hero cycle, the magic flight or rescue. An extremely strong point is brought up by Ren. He quotes King David, ""and they danced before the Lord"". He explains how he said there is a time to laugh, a time to weep and a time to mourn, and now is a time to dance. It's their way of celebrating life.The Reverend Shau and the council immediately say no to the idea of a dance. But an incident occurs helping the reverend to see his mistakes. Throughout the movie the constant struggle between the congregation and the reverend. This is noticeable in the fact that the reverend is always preaching higher up looking down at the congregation. The reverend needed to understand his struggle with his own selfishness to understand his wife, daughter and family the community.In the end the dance brings the town together especially Ren and the high school students, bringing children closer to the parents and the community closer as a whole. The involvement of decorating and preparation shows the positive side of a formal dance. Now that the cycle is complete Ren gained a rise in courage and better knowledge to continue to overcome future obstacles. Footloose provides incite to understand the cycle and seeing its influence in not only movies, television and literature, but in everyday life. It offers an innate appreciation for archetypal stories like the hero cycle.",,Anonymous,Music

Do games/music/activities make problems? Do the inspiring elements of teenage life make the tragedies or do the problems of the individuals do so?

read my comment for my summary on this movie,"FootlooseMusic was a big part of peoples' lives during the 1980's. Rock and Roll was first getting popular and people loved to dance to it. Some small towns viewed this new music and way of dancing to be dangerous, therefore make it illegal. Within the movie Footloose, the main character Ren, moves from big-city Chicago to a small town in the West where dancing where rock music and dancing are illegal. Ren has to deal with getting used to his new school and new rules, and without realizing it he will become this school's hero.When Ren first comes into town he meets Ariel, the daughter of the town's reverend, Reverend Shaw Moore, and develops a crush on her, despite the fact that she has a boyfriend. Ariel soon leaves her boyfriend because she wants to be with Ren. This clearly makes Ariel the love interest within this movie.Ren, Ariel, Woody and Willard to across the boarder into a different town and listen to music and dance all night. They soon realize that they need to bring this ridiculous law to an end. They decided that they should have a senior dance. Ren is brave enough to go in front of the town board and introduce this idea.Because of Ren's courage he is seen as the hero. Although he does have his inner shadow that makes him feel like he should give up, he continues to try. He explains to his mother why he wants to do this. He tells her how he felt when his father left, like it was his fault, and he just wanted to do something right for himself. So he gets the seniors to have a dance across the train tracks, where his boss (the wise man of the movie) tells him would be a good place to have it, where the police wouldn't be able to do anything about it because it wasn't their territory. His sidekick is his best friend in the town, Willard, who sticks by him and helps him out whenever he gets into fights. The antagonist of this movie can be the town board and the town's views on rock and roll music and dancing, or it can be viewed as Ariel's ex-boyfriend. Either way there was a struggle between good and bad.Footloose is a dramatic musical directed by Herbert Ross in 1984. It accurately shows the struggles some small towns went through. It also shows the social life of high school accurately when dealing with drugs, peer pressure, and teen rebellion. Overall this movie showed the typical characters that would be present in a hero story.",,Anonymous,Music

FootLoose,"The movie Footloose is a movie about teenagers who try to live their normal lives in a small town, however there is one thing, the minister who passed a law saying that you can not dance, or hear music in public or hear music at any time. He passed that law because of an accident that happen years ago, and his son got killed, because of drunk driving. However, Ren who comes from Chicago to live in that small town in the west tries to change the law. He also falls for the minister's daughter.Ren who is very passionate about is music and dancing, wants to change the rules in the new town where he moved in. When he get's angry he takes his anger out on dancing, his dancing becomes very intense. The love for music and dancing, brings the teenagers together after wards. Although it took hard work for Rent to fit in with everyone else, he got the teenagers attention to change everything. Ariel, the minister's daughter who is a rebel and has a boyfriend who does not go threw the rules also is a very jealous boyfriend. Ariel, also loves music and likes to dance, and really doesn't follow her father's rules. She automatically falls for Ren, and tries to seduce him. At the end they both end up being together. Ren tries to go against the town, and protests and gets a meeting with the whole town. He makes his points about having the freedom of dancing and playing music. At the end the minister changes his mind, and makes them have the dance for prom. I think this is a good movie to watch, to show how people have their own opinions, and how to solve problems.In conclusion , everyone in the town was finally happy to have music and dancing back, because that was just part of their everyday lives that they didn't have for a while. I think Ren who is a very brave young man, stood up for everyone else from his age, against the town. This was a great movie to watch, and I sure recommend others to watch it too.",,Anonymous,Music
a great film to swing to,"In the early days of the South,we found prejudice. People were Conservative and critical of things.

I enjoyed the dancing (Bacon and Penn were really cool)i feel that there is an issue of personal freedom that the movie brings up. I feel that freedom of expression is a basic right we need to preserve and protect. If it was a factual movie, then the director brought up issues that we see in today's society.",,Anonymous,Music

the outsider,"While watching Footloose one can see the different stages throughout the movie that occur to fulfill the 'hero' complex of the movie. The main character, Ren, seems to keep to himself being a new student in school. However, once he begins to warm up to the new people and once they begin to warm up to him he makes many friends as well as enemies. Ren is first seen as an outsider, a person who will only cause harm and nothing good would come of being friends with him. Ren appears to be a strong individual which is seen in the beginning during his first day at the new school. Ren is approached by Willard, but Ren doesn't take any crap and throws it right back at Willard. From there on out the two become friends and help each other through some of their hardships.Ren is seen as an outsider. In this small town outsiders are not taken lightly. Ren is only familiar with his old surroundings and the way he used to do things. Therefore, when he is told that he is not allowed to listen to music or dance out of his own taste he is very uneasy. This is where the hero circle begins with the 'call to adventure'. He doesn't want to give up something that makes him so happy and in his eyes is simple and innocent.Aerial soon comes into Ren's life and helps to turn it upside down for a time period. Aerial is the daughter of the preacher of the town. She is also the sister of one of the boys who died in a car accident 7 years before. It is thought throughout the town that music was a factor in the death of those youngsters. The preacher himself stated that listening to music will only influence the youngsters to drink and drive and begin to explore sexuality. This is an assumption he takes on that not only influences the entire town but puts a damper on his home life. The preacher and his wife don't get along as they used to. The preacher and his daughter are torn apart due to their different beliefs and stubborn personalities. Aerial loves music and dancing and grows to care for Ren.Ren realizes that he is not the only one who likes to dance and listen to music. Ren decides to show Aerial, Woody and Willard what they are missing. The four of them go to a dance club right outside of town. The four teenagers have a great time; they laugh and let loose and enjoy themselves. While Ren was beginning to be accepted by some there were still others who didn't want him around. One student tried to give him some drugs and while Ren was turning it down the coached walked in. Of course because Ren is the new student and looked down upon he got kicked off the gymnastics team. Of course the reasoning was because of low funding but everyone knew the real reason. This incident is the one that leads Ren down the road to a mission. He comes up with the great idea to hold a dance.The idea of Ren having a dance quickly gets around town. The preacher is angry and swears he will not let this dance happen. The dance approval has to be run by the town during a town meeting. Aerial and Woody pass out flyers and gather people to attend this meeting on behalf of the students. While the girls are rallying the troops Ren is busy teaching Willard how to dance. The scenes are shown with the two laughing and enjoying themselves without any sexual attractions occurring. When it comes time for the town meeting Ren stands up and speaks his mind about the idea. The idea is even pushed my Aerial's mother, which goes to show the differences in the home. Ren's idea doesn't make it much farther than the town meeting. Then another aspect of the hero circle occurs. Ren's boss pushes him to follow through with his thought of a dance. He tells him where to have it and talks him into it. At this point in the movie the hero circle is almost complete. It ends with the 'sharing of the gift'. The gift was prom and the views to the town that they refused to see before.In the beginning of the movie Ren is seen as nothing but bad comings, but by the end of the movie that all changes. Ren is soon accepted and able to do the things that he loves with people he likes and cares for. Ren is completes the hero circle through hardships with being accepted, accepting himself, and allowing others to see his points of view.",,Anonymous,Music
"Not a bad movie, but pointless as a remake","I was a teen when the original movie came out, and I also live near Lehi, Utah where it was filmed which made me think fondly of the movie whenever I drove by the Lehi Roller Mills. (Today it is a sprawling metropolis, resembling little of the sleepy little town like in the movie.) When I heard another pointless remake was coming out, I decided to give it the Redbox treatment instead of completely boycotting it.After watching it with my wife who had never seen the original, I was able to say, ""Not so bad, but pointless as a remake."" Most of the original music (which I still love) was recycled into something recognizable but not lovable. The scenes played out nearly identical to the original but with different actors. The whole way through it, I had the feeling that the director was watching the original on a hand-held device, then turned to the actors and said, ""I have an idea for this next scene."" If I recall correctly, even the dialog where it wasn't modernized with MP3 players (instead of cassette players) and cell phones (instead of...what the heck did we have?) was word for word.Usually remakes are for big block busters where today's technology and special effects can outshine the feeble attempts of the past and make a great story better by sucking the audience in. This movie had none of that, and in summary, became another pointless Hollywood rehash for quick cash. The only improvement I could acknowledge was a sub-plot that explained Ren's actions a little better, but it was still not an excuse to remake a classic.My advice: watch the original. It's much better.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
This version of Footloose is a pretty good remake of the original,"Full disclosure time: I saw the original 1984 version at the now-defunct Cinema 8 multiplex at the also-now defunct Bon Marche Mall (the buildings have been renovated into other places) and I remember enjoying it very much at the one time I watched it in its entirety. I had also bought the soundtrack LP album beforehand and had highly enjoyed that several times as a teenager. Then there were also videos of several of its hits like Deniece Williams' ""Let's Hear It for the Boy"", Bonnie Tyler's ""Holding Out for a Hero"", and Kenny Loggins' title song which consisted mainly of clips of Kevin Bacon's (or his dance double's) movements. So it was with all that in mind that I saw this remake with an open head. The verdict: I still had a good time though my excitement factor wasn't as overwhelming perhaps because of my fond memories of the original and some of the changes didn't seem necessary. Still, having the actor Miles Teller playing the same role done by Chris Penn nearly 30 years before in learning to dance and enjoying himself as a result was still a highlight in both versions. And former ""Dancing with the Stars"" pro Julianne Hough shows some chops in reenacting the Lori Singer role. And while Kenny Wormald won't make you forget Bacon in his iconic role, he's not too bad either. And the same goes for Dennis Quaid playing the John Lithgow part. So on that note, this version of Footloose is recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Kenny Wormald is a better dancer than actor,"The small town of Bomont imposed curfews and banned loud music and dancing after an accident killed five teenagers including Rev. Shaw Moore (Dennis Quaid)'s son. Three years later, Ren MacCormack (Kenny Wormald) moves from Boston to live with his aunt and uncle after his mother's death from leukemia. He finds the small town restrictive. He also finds reverent's daughter Ariel (Julianne Hough) rebelling against the system. He makes a friend in Willard (Miles Teller).I don't think it's a wise move to show the accident. It makes the ban more reasonable and harder to oppose. The Reverend is supposed to be overreaching and becoming unreasonable over the years. However the bigger problem has to be Kenny Wormald. He's more of a dancer than an actor. He doesn't have the charisma or the likability to lead. Julianne Hough comes off better. Although I would have prefer she has better separation between her two lives. She needs to dress down more as the preacher's daughter. This is a functional dance movie but not much else. It's also sad to see that the filmmaker can't think of ways to change up the story. This is obviously a Julianne Hough star vehicle. So it would be so much better to make her the newcomer to town and the lead of the movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
How Did It Get This High Of A Rating???,"This movie sucked big time! They remixed all of the songs from the original for no reason and it sucked so bad! I almost wanted to throw up after seeing it. The dancing is just so embarrassing and it basically craps all over the original. I'm so appalled that this movie has a rating higher than a one. It sucks so bad it should of been rated the worst remake in the history of remakes! I would much rather see somebody suffering a horrible death than ever watch this film again. I feel embarrassed to be called a human being because this film shows how stupid we all are! We let this happen and now there's no hope. If aliens come down from space and see this movie they will probably look at us as if we are the dumbest living thing on the planet! This movie is the reason an apocalypse should happen!

From a small town so enjoyed it,"The bad reviews must be city folk, I grew up in a small Alabama suburb, it has a touch of Western swing, would have liked to see more country tunes involved, not the weird remake of the original footloose lol. The dude who played Ren isn't an actor he's a dancer so he's not gonna be the best of the best, miles teller makes a great side character, of being a good ole boy which I like, the plot could have been more exciting, not banning dancing from a town seems ultimately like a fairy tale, not as good as the original, but a good remake for the small town communities, I love some cowboy boots and jeans kinda dancin!!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
If you've seen the original no need to watch this one.,"I love the original and was really excited to see this remake. I was very disappointed. They copied the original, just added cell phones and CD's and a few modern dance moves. Same soundtrack, just a hint modernized, I'm pretty sure even some of the lines were exactly the same. There was nothing creative or original about this movie.You know that feeling where you see an actor/actress in a certain role and then you see them in another movie and it's like they were told to keep the same character but the film's setting is so completely different and all you can think is 'no, this is wrong, this just doesn't work'. It's exactly what I thought while watching this film but instead of the character(s) being wrong it felt like the whole movie was wrong.I would have even accepted it if the only thing they kept was the basic concept and redesigned the rest from scratch. But they played it too safe and ended up with a copy instead of a fresh film.That said if you've never seen the original Footloose it's alright.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Is This Remake Necessary?,"The remake of the 1984 classic Footloose is not a bad movie and is actually quite fun at times, but was it necessary to remake a movie that doesn't need a remake? I mean both of these movies are very similar to each other with the exception of some very minor plot changes. The music is good to listen to as always since the Kenny Loggins hit song is still a classic. I won't lie that I had the itch to get up and dance a few times. But quality-wise, it's on par with the original and possibly maybe a little less.Craig Brewer's film is about a guy named Ren who moves to a Tennessee town and finds out dancing is illegal because of a fatal accident. He falls in love with the preacher's daughter and Ren decides to do all he can to bring dancing and rock'n'roll back in town.The acting isn't really that bad. Kenny Wormald is a decent choice to play Ren but obviously no one will beat Kevin Bacon. Julianne Hough is also decent as the preacher's daughter and Dennis Quaid makes a tough minister.Overall, this is a good film but as it's almost the same as the original even when it comes to dialogue, I can't help feeling I'm actually reviewing the original. This has some good songs and people of today's generation will probably like this more than those who grew up with the original. I rate this film 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

An all-around enjoyable movie,"I found the remake of Footloose thoroughly enjoyable. Granted, I wasn't around when the original was released and don't have the attachment to it of teens of that time, but I appreciated this movie. It may not have had the best acting as the original or carried the same weight, but it was a feel-good movie that put a smile on a my face. It had amazing dance sequences and great music that left me dancing out of the theater. Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough brought a certain airy feeling to the film that was missing from the original, and their chemistry-- especially on the dance floor--was palpable. I think that it was a perfect movie for my generation who didn't grow up watching the original.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Well Done,"I had not seen any of the Footlooses but I just watched ""Footloose"" (2011) and enjoyed it more than I thought I would. The cast is great, I really liked the leads, and the filming is good. I thought it could have used a few more good songs though. Some of the music was lackluster. I will rate this a 7/10 though, and now I have to see the 1984 version.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Not as awful as it could have been, but not overly great either","I enjoy bad movies, and enjoy bad remakes even more. So when the opportunity to get advanced passes to the atrocious looking remake of Footloose came, I pounced on them just out of the sheer will to see what kind of monstrosity Craig Brewer and company came up with. The film had gone through a number of changes, and had plenty of room to improve on the original. Sadly, I do not think there was ever any hope for it.After a horrific accident takes the lives of five high school seniors, the town of Bomont, Tennessee outlaws a number of activities for the teenage populace including dancing. Enter Ren McCormack (Kenny Wormald), a city kid and distinct outsider to the close knit Bomont townspeople. He is confused by the bans, and after making a few new friends, sets out to get them abolished.While the nostalgia factor may cloud the memories of some people, the original Footloose is really nothing more than a fun diversion packed alongside an absolutely infectious soundtrack that is still great even today. It is a fairly silly film really, but with the help of Kevin Bacon's 1984-era charm and charisma, the film remains a wildly enjoyable film. Yet somehow, in remaking the film for an audience in 2011, it seems like the filmmakers missed more than a few steps along the way.Now I will be the first to admit that this new remake does have a handful of fun scenes and astonishing dance choreography. The trailers do a good job of showing off just how great some of the dance moves are from this new cast, but what it does not let on too much is that most of these scenes come when they are replicating scenes from the original film. I basked in the glory of hearing Kenny Loggins blasting, while watching the various pairs of feet dancing to the beat. And seeing Willard (Miles Teller) learning how to dance is one of the highlights of the film, much like it is the original film. A key dance sequence late in the film is also significantly better than I could have ever predicted.But that is where the enjoyment ends.The rest of the film that surrounds these scenes is dull and lifeless, moving at a snail's pace and just going through the motions. There is very little fun to be had, and should someone venture into the film without having seen the original, they may wonder why anyone wanted to remake it in the first place. Instead of trying to improve and make the plot line less ludicrous, the filmmakers left the entire crux of the film the exact same. They merely changed a few character traits around, shuffled in some racy dialogue, and took out the tractors and added in school buses. They sucked out all the fun, and what is left seems like a mere project that was cranked out with little to no thought for what audiences may actually perceive to be enjoyable.Worse yet, the soundtrack is a totally forgettable affair. While it is the crucial element of the original film, it feels like a largely laughable affair here. I was originally intrigued at the idea of the film containing all the original songs, albeit covered by new artists. But somehow, all of the catchiness of the original tunes seems to have been stripped from these new ones. Instead, we are left with versions that have a country twang or overtly urban feel to them, and absolutely no reason to want to listen to these new versions ever again. I would be lying if I did not think the most memorable tracks in the film were the two original ones that somehow were deemed okay to fit into the film. I would register a guess that this is the influence of Brewer, who is best known for Hustle & Flow and Black Snake Moan. He has a distinctly Southern taste to his body of work, and practically forces it on this film. But in forcing this ideology, alongside two completely different genres of music, he crushes the film into submission, leaving many scenes an absolute mess.The acting in the film is even more disappointing. Dennis Quaid looks embarrassed in every scene he is in, overacting as much as he possibly can to forget that he is in the film. Andie McDowell looks like she wandered in off the wrong set, and just decided to stick around as a background character. Wormald is a poor substitute for Bacon, and is an even worse lead for a major motion picture. I realize he is a dancer first and foremost, but leaving him to carry this film was an awful decision. He looks frightened and confused for the majority of the film, and quivers through most of his lines. He lacks Ren's charm, and is never believable when he rebels against authority. You want to believe in this character, but all you will do is laugh at how staggeringly bad Wormald's performance is. Julianne Hough, the female lead, at least attempts to act. She comes close to a breakthrough in more than one instance, but she comes off a bit too amateur for her own good. She makes a great dance partner for Wormald, but for what little shred of chemistry she has, it is made totally moot when he opens his mouth.What redeems the film from being the awful travesty it should be is Teller's performance as Willard. The moment he walks on-screen, he has an energy to him that is simply unmatchable. He is the single best thing about the film, embodying the innocence, spirit and fun of Chris Penn's original performance. If you venture into this remake, see it for him and ignore the rest. You may find some remotely enjoyable experience buried in there somewhere.4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Footloose is not the original but an amazing remake,"The 2011 remake of the classic movie Footloose, is a story of a boy, named Ren, who is moving to a new town and falls in love with a girl named Ariel (Juliana Houag). Although while he's there he discovers there are laws against public dancing and decides to start a petition against the town's board to change the law. The town had shut down any and all drinking, dancing, and inappropriate behavior due to a car crash with teenagers, and while Ren (Kenny Wormland) is newer to the town he makes a lasting impression. This remake has much of the same dialog, but some differences in some of the more famous scenes such as the warehouse dance scene. Kenny Wormland is a dancer so he was able to take Ren to the next level. The movie can not compare to the original as that is what was made first and is unbeatable, but it has its differences from the original and is definitely worth the watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Deep southern fried footloose,"The new footloose is a real hodgepodge; dancing, Southern culture, love story, family, church, tragedy all sort of power-blended into with the spices of music styles of blues, country, Jack White and the footloose theme song. While perhaps brilliant in small areas, it doesn't make for a good film.I don't know if it's because I'm a guy, I found Julianna Hough's character fascinating or maybe it's because it's something the director really knows how to do well. It's basically the same character as Christia Ricci's in Black Snake Moan. The themes are all there, young confused beautiful girl that's rebelling in sexuality but meets salvation from her troubles from a man who refuses the sexual advances for something more gentlemanly. Saying that, Justin Timberlake's acting and character in Black Snake Moan was one of the most atrocious things on a major movie. The new-comer dancing Kenny Wormald fares a lot better but doesn't manage to shine. Ren played by Kenny, never really exudes rebellion nor does the chemistry with Ariel (Hough) truly sizzle. He exudes the sinuous athleticism but rarely convinces as a public orator or as a rebel or a lover. Dennis Quaid doesn't look the part of a preacher and feels way too hip to be an antagonist to dancing.For a movie with dancers in the lead, the movie is quite restrained in the dancing department. It is almost stolen by Willart (Miles Teller) who does his amateurish renditions that almost outshine Ren. There is never a real sizzling dance between Ren and Ariel except for a short one in a drive in movie field that is never given the full treatment. Even the factory solo dancing isn't cathartic and explosive enough to awe. The soundtrack that mixes blues, country, rock and with a very little pop does give the movie a distinctive feel but really detracts from dancing since the choreographers don't really become inventive with the odd soundtrack. The angst, family drama and tragedy never seem to gel with the footloose skeleton borrowed from the original movie, nor does it really gel with the dancing.While the movie is truly Brewer's footloose, the movie would have greatly benefited from either more dancing or a more introspective study of catharsis through dance by a more charismatic lead. As it is, it's an odd movie - riding on the footloose name while trying to explore themes perhaps not quite suitable to a dance movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"It did as I expected, it sucked","Like usual, I am beaten to the review page by the wannabes that made this wretched film. The studio hacks and lackeys got here and posted rave reviews first. This was lame, not that the original was all that, but did they really have to try this? Who is this Hough girl anyway, saw her on a zits commercial and it's like, ""hey all, Julianne here"" like anybody that does not watch one reality flick would know her. I promise this crap movie will not help, it is a stinker. Is it as good as the last? No where near. It is pretty much the same, Quaid turns in a good performance, as usual, but I wish he had turned this down. The rest of them, mediocre at best. Is Hollywood out of ideas? Is writing new material that hard? I think the remake era is over, please come up with something new and use real stars, not reality hacks who have long since been over their fifteen minutes.",,Anonymous,Music
Cut loose and see Footloose 2011!,"Preview screening on Monday 3 October 2011: I saw the original version of Footloose as a teenager and quite enjoyed it, particularly the music. As a result the film and its soundtrack will forever remind me of my adolescence. I would not have thought 27 years later that I would be sitting in a cinema watching a remake of it but hence I did and thoroughly enjoyed it. Quite a few of the songs from the original movie are still in this version, and while the story is still basically the same the film contains more racially diverse characters (something that was sadly lacking from the original) and a fairly snappy script. The original of course made a big star out of Kevin Bacon in the main role of Ren McCormack, and Kenny Wormald fills those shoes very well. His pretty boy looks and great dance moves will only get him so far but thankfully he can also act. Julianne Hough as the rebellious preacher's daughter looks beautiful and does an admirable job as Ariel. However it is Miles Teller as Willard, Ren's friend who cannot dance, that almost steals the movie. Willard's self deprecating hick southern character is played with much style by Teller. Dennis Quaid as Reverend Shaw Moore is suitably morose as the preacher / father in support of the ban on dancing in the little town of Boton, though I thought John Lithgow encapsulated the character better in the original. Craig Brewer who wrote and directed 2005's acclaimed Hustle and Flow has done a very good job with this remake of Footloose and the audience I saw it with seemed to thoroughly enjoy it. So cut loose and see Footloose 2011 as it is a very enjoyable and entertaining movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Suffers as much by miscasting as the original benefited by its casting,"To the same extent Ava Gardner movies lingered on her face in the 1950's and Jessica Alba movies visually caressed her abdomen in 1990's movies so does this moving on the backside of Julianne Hough. Likely this has partially to do with Craig Brewer's personal interests and a lack of other interesting images to look at in a pointless remake of the Kevin Bacon ""classic"" (assuming you grew up in the 80's). The main drag on the film grows from the lack of a Kevin Bacon-level compelling talent among the cast. When Kenny Womald utters the iconic ""let's dance"" to the camera you could picture yourself opting to sit this one out instead. When Dennis Quaid as Ariel's father and town elder finally has his change of heart, it comes as no really emotional catharsis given Quaid's earnestness and track record as the good guy leading man. Now Randy Quaid would have made an interesting and likely challenging from a product standpoint casting choice. Julianne Hough plays Ariel as more sleazy than fun-loving and her dance moves do kind of make you agree to an extent with the Reverend. As always, Andie MacDowell brings her inexcusably flat line readings to a part that could have been cut from the film with little effect. Everyone else in the film comes across as the indistinguishable chorus line from a traveling company version of the Footloose Musical. Having said all that, the movie brings some entertaining visuals although it someone screws up the soundtrack; the version of ""Holding Out for a Hero"" used her is a sacrilege of the original Bonnie Tyler version of the Jim Steinman song. In short, see the original instead; although it wasn't very good either, the music was amazing.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

"Not particularly perfect, but humorous, toe tapping, and decently told for what it is.","I got a chance to attend an advanced screening of Footloose, the remake of the 1984 original film.Boston born teenager, Ren McCormack (Kenny Wormald), leaves behind a troubled past in his old town, moving to Bomont, Tennessee, where dancing was outlawed through a notion by the local Reverend (Dennis Quaid) after a tragic car crash three years earlier. Ren decides to challenge the ban on dancing, and falls for the Reverend's daughter (Julianne Hough).Footloose is not that special of a story. Character arcs are formulaic, several actions in the film are reckless, but at least they have a decent cast to lift them above that. Dennis Quaid is great, Kenny Wormald is decent enough, and Miles Teller is a riot of hilarity as Willard (Ren's clueless friend). I also really enjoyed the dance sequences, which featured some really slick choreography.But not everything in the film works, including Julianne Hough. Her acting never really impressed me, she seems a bit too old for the role, and her character is under written.All in all, Footloose is just fine for some light entertainment.**1/2 out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Give me the original!,"I can't believe I wasted $7.50 last night to see this horrendous remake of ""Footloose,"" but I was desperate to see a movie and nothing good was playing at the $1.50 theater.

Even though I felt that the 1984 film had a lame script (and acting), I loved the score, dancing, and scenery and the movie remains one of my favorite ""guilty pleasures."" Dean Pitchford wrote this script, which is almost a carbon copy of the original movie. Most of the same songs were used but were ""updated."" The only big difference is that the two leads--Kenny and Julianna--can actually dance whereas Kevin Bacon and Lori Singer couldn't (or at least not much). I'm still fuming at wasting all my money last night and would have walked out if I had paid only $1.50. Sorry to be so harsh in this review but I was not impressed.

"Pointless for fans of the original, fun for everyone else.","I admit I went into this rehash expecting to hate it. I watched the trailer and cringed. I watched the 1984 original trailer and my heart went out to all the fans of Kevin Bacon and his classic 80s rendition of the film. I thought of how I would feel if some hack director for hire dared to remake 1985's The Breakfast Club or The Goonies or Back to the Future.Just think if 1984's Footloose can be remade in 2011, all these classics could be despoiled for 2012 audiences. That's next freaking year! So if you want to avoid this (and the unleashing of Armageddon with it), don't, whatever you do, pay to see this remake in the cinema. It will only encourage Hollywood to keep sacrificing originality at the altar of making a quick and (relatively) easy buck.That said, I have a few admissions to make: 1. I've never seen the original Footloose. Kevin Bacon is great but dancing movies just aren't my thing so it was never really on my list of missed classics that I had to watch. 2. Like I said I don't particularly like dancing films or even musicals or teen romances. So I've never seen Save the Last Dance, Honey, Stomp the Yard, You Got Served or even West Side Story. 3. I actually thoroughly enjoyed the Footloose remake.Why? Well I'm sure most of these reasons extend to the original. The dancing's great. The story (though a little ridiculous) is involving and the characters engaging. The forces of religion and the law versus the kids of the small town make for a compelling and righteous battle between order and chaos. In this age of the curtailing of civil liberties under the guise of protecting us from evil, perhaps this remake is actually rather relevant.Dennis Quaid is always very good value, no matter how poor the script but his character here is well-rounded and sympathetic even when banning dancing and public gatherings.The two leads look pretty and dance like pros and while Julianne Hough (how's that pronounced???) spends much of the film looking like she's on a modeling shoot, emotions run high in climactic conflicts with her father (Quaid).Comparing the two trailers, it looks like the remake has slavishly stuck to the original's template in terms of characters, narrative and even specific shots so this is probably another ridiculously pointless remake along the lines of Gus Van Sant's Psycho. However audiences like me who have never seen the original will no doubt be sucked in by the good story, great dancing and even better music.If your toes aren't tapping by the finale, you're either a fuming fan of the original or your feet must be nailed to the floor. It's out October 14th and is definitely worth a watch. But before you shell out please heed my warning. The Breakfast Club could be next.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Remake mistake,"The original Footloose was a little film with a debatable script and a little budget. But contrary to all expectations was quite successful across the globe and became with time a cult movie and that thanks to the infectious music, dance routines quite impressive for the time, but most of all to a brilliant casting, believable and very suitable to their roles. Same thing that happened to Dirty Dancing. So take the original cast, the music and the novelty of the dance routines away from the equation and what is left is a very forgettable film with very unmemorable music, very ordinary dance routine and with a cast that makes you miss the old one every step of the way. Who was the guy playing the main role? I can't even remember his face that much mediocre he was and what about the leading lady, with no depth what so ever, painfully bad actors both with no chemistry between them. Do we need to equal the tension between the unassuming sex appeal of Kevin Bacon in that role and the irresistibly attractive vulnerability brought to the role by Lori Singer? Was it a not intentional carrier suicide taking up roles that are so vividly embedded in people memories? Was it? Well, I feel I need to mention, the countryman friend role, that in the original was so adorably played by Chris Penn, the guy who played the same part is such a poor takeoff, a caricature and his girlfrienda bubbly full of energy Sara Jessica Parker against a very dull actress there to fill space and nothing more. Even the original father and mother role (the preacher and his wife) were far more engaging at the point that you could see their point of view and sympathize, the original roles were played by John Lithgow and Dianne Weist, (believable even as a loving couple) in this new version played by Dennis Quaid and Andy MacDowell , that I usually really like, here they fell flat unable to be convincing in their role as troubled preacher and over concern but very tender and caring father and as the effectual moderator, sweet but strong mother as it was in the original.

Other than that, there is little appeal in the film, as it shamelessly recycles almost every scene, event, and line from its original counterpart, and the ones it doesn't, it modifies for an audience that is questionably existent. If there's anything the film made me do, it made me seriously contemplate what a ""remake"" actually is and what their inherent goal is. To make the original material better? Make the story more current? Give it a stronger, more contemporary feel and look? If those questions were considered during the making of the Footloose remake, they weren't considered for very long. This is a stale, unimaginably boring picture, with its first real problem being it is trying to make an immensely dated story of music and dancing banishment current and relatable to teenagers of the present. In a time where vulgar rap by artists named ""Chief Keef,"" ""Juicy J,"" and ""Wiz Khalifa"" can be found on the iPods of teens in schools and they can get away with it, I highly doubt teens will be able to resonate with playing Kenny Loggins or Quiet Riot a bit too loud.The original Footloose at least had the benefit of being a film with a contemporary issue to its time and the appeal of its lead, Kevin Bacon. Granted watching it now is like dusting off a C-grade vinyl that barely functions, it at least had the ability to give the student body a voice and a personality as they tried to keep their freedom to play rock music (please say this out loud) alive and well. The new Footloose, however, is like that guy randomly wearing acid-washed jeans in public in 2013; random, out of place, and questionable beyond belief.The story hasn't changed at all; we center our sites on the small town of Bomont, Georgia, that has been musically silenced since reverend Shaw Moore (Dennis Quaid) pressured the city council to ban music and dancing after loud music ""resulted"" in the deaths of five teenagers driving late at night. I say ""resulted"" because the cause of death was more of teenage stupidity. The pop music blaring on the radio at the time had little effect.Ten years after this horrendous legislation, Bostonian teenager Ren McCormack (Kenny Wormald) waltzes into town and experiences a culture shock when he realizes that, hey, not only do people who live in other towns have different lifestyles than himself, but music is frowned upon in this tight-nit community. However, that doesn't stop Moore's rebellious daughter Ariel (Julianne Hough), who can often be found batting her bubbly blue eyes and shaking her bouncy backside in no mans land areas deep in the outskirts of town along with dozens of other teens.Right off the bat, Moore isn't fond of the way Ren behaves. His attitude is smarmy and purposefully instigating, and the thought that he is a teen with something to say unnerves him greatly. The remainder of the film amplifies this conflict between them, as well as trying to make a bold statement that teenagers are supposed to be reckless, dumb, and the driving force behind many mistakes.This conflict between Ren and ""the man"" leads all the way to the city council, where Ren tries to use Bible verses to sway the entire council (including Moore) to allow music and public dancing to be etched back in Bomont's society. He states that people in biblical times danced for God and Jesus, leaping and ecstatically celebrating them with the art of movement. Okay. I'm sure when Ariel is gyrating and shaking her blue-jean short-shorts in front of every guy in a vacant field she definitely has our lord and savior in mind. Same with Ren; I'm sure when he got down in the crowded saloon for line dancing or when him and several others fight the gang of bullies during a school dance at the end of the film, they all had God and Jesus in their hearts and minds. You couldn't fool a maroon with your logic.Director Craig Brewer (Black Snake Moan and Hustle and Flow - two films that wouldn't even be on the same shelf as Footloose in ANY category, list, arrangement, etc) doesn't even offer any pleasing attributes to this film stylistically, albeit some good choreography. Other than maybe a few good scenes involving a large production number and several dozen dancers, the film's redone music, contemporary atmosphere, updated production, and caricature-driven cast seems like an act of indolence, if anything. I had a hard time admiring the original Footloose, but credited it for being something of a time-staple, even if it doesn't hold up well in present time. It's hard to credit the new Footloose at all, since its very existence is perplexing.Starring: Kenny Wormald, Julianne Hough, Andie MacDowell, and Dennis Quaid.

So much better than the original,"Kenny Wormald blows Kevin Bacon away. If you're going to rate the overall story...it's lame. But the 2011 version is definitely more refined and flows together better than the original. I have both on Blu-ray and have watched each many times. I love Kevin Bacon, but he doesn't dance as well or have the athletic physique of Kenny Wormald. The dancing is better. The music, although for the most part is the same, sounds better. Even the two little girls who help Willard learn to dance are cuter and come across as better performers. It's no contest. The 2011 version is way better than the original. Watch both with the original first and the 2011 after. Decide for yourself!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Kenny Wormald & Julianne Hough will surprise you,"FOOTLOOSE (B+) The Remake of 1984's Classic had trouble from the beginning. Zac Efron quit the project & then Chace Crawford was shuffled aside along with director. I always thought Chace Crawford was a good choice and when the promos released, I hated Kenny Wormald but after watching the movie last Night, I think ""Kenny Wormald"" was indeed the best part of the movie. Playing cocky is tough because you start hating the character, but Kenny Wormald played cockiness with such an ease & confidence that you would like him to succeed in his mission for abolition of laws against dancing & music. Kenny Wormald's is a born dance and his dancing skills can easily be seen in Footloose. Besides Kenny Wormald, the second surprise is Julianne Hough as I've seen her dancing & music videos but never thought she is so pretty. Julianne Hough looked sweet & damn sexy, she completely radiates through the screen. Not only she is a fine dancer, but a fine actress too. Overall, Footloose is fun flick, with fun country music & dancing. worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Terrible...and Boring,"The previews looked terrible but I wanted to like it and thought maybe it would be fun fluff. Nope. The original, '80s version wasn't rocket science but it was fun and sweet with great music and was loved by kids and adults. My mom played the soundtrack all the time. The premise of the original was taken with a grain of salt. In the remake they try to focus on the premise by getting all dramatic and emotional which just makes the fact that dancing is outlawed outrageous and comical. Not to mention, why would they outlaw dancing for drinking and driving? That's rather far fetched. In the original both Ren and Ariel had problems...but they seemed to deal with them like any other teen, with trademark angst, so, you could identify with them and like them. In the remake they have therapy kind of anger and issues that I could not identify with and the script failed to make the characters sympathetic, so, I didn't care about them. Ren was more just angry and a bit of a jerk (though, lesser in the sense that they added much bigger jerks to this film, I suppose in an attempt to make him more likable, though, that failed), and Ariel was also angry, reckless, slutty, bratty, and made her best friend angry...what is to like about that? In the original, Kevin Bacon was cute and charming and a leader. In this one Ren is kind of dorky, has a weird Boston accent that comes in and out, brooding, and everyone in the film is angry, rebellious and breaking the law of dancing so there is no real reason for Ren to even be in this film other than to add to the mix. He doesn't stand out in anyway, he just seems like some random face in the crowd trying to get through school so he can grow up to be an angry adult who works as a mechanic or something.In the original there was a great pop soundtrack which worked and held the film together and made it fun. In this one there is country, hip hop and rock? None of it holds together as one working piece, kind of jumps you around, and doesn't give you any sense of the film. I mean, pick a freakin' theme. Just one.In the original it was just a bunch of kids who liked to dance. In this film apparently everyone in a small Southern town is a professional dancer and likes to create synchronized line dancing to '80s songs. In the original you felt for their plight because the rules put upon them were ridiculous and Ariel was reckless because she felt pent up by the rules. In this version they were doing the exact same things that got them into trouble in the first place. There was no change, it was just illegal so they weren't really pent up and acting out. Anywhere in America it is illegal for minors to drink but minors get together in field parties and house parties, anyway. And, realistically, you could get a ticket for playing your music too loud and disturbing the peace. It just depends on the cop. Also, of course if a father sees his daughter behaving in a slutty manner with some new boy he's not going to want her to see him and will probably ground her. So, the point of this films is void. In the original the point was the rules were ridiculous and the parents were over the top. In this film they're mostly just being parents.Also, Ren vandalized the placer where he works?? Not only is he an idiot but clearly he likes to 'cause trouble. He seems more like someone who is going to end up in jail than someone who is going to be a hero and make a difference in a town.Clearly this is just a film where someone was trying to profit off the 'Step Up' success and use an old, popular brand to try to draw a crowd. Why not just let the film survive on its own rather than trying to meld some weird country and hip hop world together. It just seemed forced, calculated, ridiculous and unrealistic. If most of the film seems ridiculous and unrealistic you lose the point in watching it. I really get the sense that the writers don't have much point of reference of the world other than living in Los Angeles and watched a bunch of episodes of 'Gossip Girl' so they could understand the teen plight and how they interact, then thew a country hillbilly meets Boston spin on it. Considering, in a lot of small towns the kids are still fairly innocent and polite, it would have been easy to stick to the original film rather than try to make this an 'updated' film where all kids are angry, bratty and doing pretty much everything to make a parents cringe. Why would anyone like, admire or want to be those kids?",4.0,Anonymous,Music
I really enjoyed it a lot because I was expecting so little from it!,"'FOOTLOOSE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)This is one of those movies I really enjoyed a lot because I was expecting so little from it. I never saw the original 1984 Kevin Bacon cult classic in it's entirety (although now I'd really like to) so I'm obviously not a big fan of it and had no unreasonable expectations in that way. I just expected the movie to be light pop teen fare, appealing only to an MTV ADD audience but I was pleasantly surprised. I've read this updated remake is extremely faithful to the original (many critics say too faithful). It was co-written by the original film's writer (Dean Pitchford, who also wrote most of the songs) and Craig Brewer who also directed the film (Brewer also wrote and directed such popular edgy films as 'HUSTLE & FLOW' and 'BLACK SNAKE MOAN'). I can't compare it to the original (nor should I) but this film is definitely a well made crowd pleaser.Professional dancers Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough were cast as the two leads in the film, rather than actors, and they turn in better performances than most any other young popular stars could in their place (especially the likes of Zac Effron and Chace Crawford, who were originally considered for the leading male role). Wormald plays Ren McCormack, a teen from Boston who recently lost his mother to cancer and moves in with his Aunt (Kim Dickens) and Uncle (Ray McKinnon) in the small town of Bomont Georgia. Ren, being a free spirit, clashes with the ultra-conservative town where several absurd Christian paternalistic laws were put in place three years earlier when the town's popular reverend, Shaw Moore (Dennis Quaid), lost his son (along with four of his friends) to a drunk driving accident. The harsh laws include a teen curfew as well as laws against playing rock music too loud and dancing. Shaw's daughter Ariel (Hough) is also a rebellious free spirit who's been sinking further and further into depression since the loss of her brother and absence of her father (on an emotional level). Ren and Ariel hit it off but Ren is of course seen as a virus to the town which begins a moral war.The movie is very inspiring as well as surprisingly emotionally moving in places. It's also just a great feel good movie thanks in large part to the overall craftsmanship of the film as well as the performances and crowd pleasing soundtrack. Wormald makes an impressive leading man debut and Hough is great eye candy, turning in one of the hottest performances of the year. I know it's missing the Bacon but I think Wormald could be every bit as talented an actor as Kevin (although it's way too early to really tell). Like I said I don't know how good the original was to compare it to (hopefully I soon will though) but every remake should be based solely on it's own merits anyway. This is a good film, it does everything it sets out to do in a quality way.

Never watched the original! And I recommend this one!,"Never watched the original!So after we cleared that out, Imma keep it honest.Its a light watch, modern style movie.All the reviews state the same thing, worse than the original, bad character development, no real life connections. Never used that phrase before but 'OK boomers'.To me it was nice atmosphere. A picture of a place I would hardly ever see in my lifetime.Characters were underdeveloped sadly but had great potential. On a today's scale there is a understandable relationship between the characters. More pure honest communication in the community, I presume something that is likely for a small southern town in the USA, which I very much liked.Music is way better, don't let the other reviews destroy that feeling in you just cuz they hate on 'presumably' worse version of already existing movie. Blake Shelton's Footloose is the better version in my eyes and ears.I like the actors trying, I mean I can see them struggle act cuz they aint experienced or talented, actually they are pretty much just dancers but they are trying hard and I admire that!Over all if you are looking for a deep dramatic movie... well it aint such.

Even worse than I thought,"Ok, so I grew up watching the original on VHS/DVD, so when I saw the poor reviews of this I thought they were just comparing it to the original. And, there are plenty of shots and lines from the original that they try to incorporate that just don't work.I don't even know where to start. Making Ren from Boston just because the nameless actor they chose couldn't shed his accent was just a huge swing and miss. I mean, I actually thought the accent was fake, that's how bad this whole thing was.And, I'm sorry, when are they gonna stop trying to make Julianne Hough happen?? Nothing about her is special. She's passable in roles that require singing, but that's about it (her singing isn't even good). The fact that the only movies she's headlined in have flopped MAJORLY should be an indication.And, I'm sorry, this is supposed to take place in some backwoods Utah town, where did the whole parking lot of black girls twerking to R&B/Hip Hop music come from? Especially when the next scene is line dancing to country music in some honkey tonk (where even the 1st timer Ren happens to know EVERY step of the line dance).Even though the original was fairly cheesy, it was original and from the 80's where there was such a thing as endearing cheesiness. LOL, there was literally just a line, ""Why are you dancing with another guy while you're wearing my hat?!""There were just too many scenes that were poor direct copies and too many scenes that were ridiculous derivations.

"While there are worse remakes out there, 'Footloose' suffers most from not having any point to it","Despite being an enormous hit at the time, the original 'Footloose' is somewhat of a love it/hate it film.To me, it wasn't a great film, did have issues with the story, some of the script and one dance sequence (the one in the abandoned warehouse). However, the immense appeal is definitely understandable and the original 'Footloose' still stands up as an enjoyable film for the soundtrack, dancing/choreography and the casting.While there are definitely worse remakes out there ('Psycho' and 'The Wicker Man'), 'Footloose' (2011) is still, like a fair few remakes, rather pointless.It's not all awful. The best thing about is Miles Teller, a great and instantly appealing performance that is every bit as good as Chris Penn's in the original, the only actor in the film to have that distinction. Some of the dancing is dazzlingly good, especially Willard learning how to dance. Plus the production values are beautiful.However, while the soundtrack was unforgettable and toe-tapping in the original they are forgettable here, the more contemporary and country arrangements robbing them of their catchiness and charm. The songs themselves are not bad at all, far from it, but how they're arranged are very much so. There are some great moments with the dancing, but too much of the dancing lacks the finger-snapping quality and energy of the original's choreography.'Footloose' further suffers from being too faithful, with a lot of the same material but with little to none of the nostalgic charm and fun. Nothing is done also to improve on the daftness, ridiculousness and schmaltz of the story from the original, instead those problems are actually amplified here, with lots of cheese and overwrought emotion, and hurt even further by pacing that feels like one is riding on the back of a snail.Miles Teller aside, though Ray McKinnon and Kim Dickens are also quite good but aren't in it enough, the cast just don't cut it, and neither does the very uninspired direction. Kenny Wormald is an incredible dancer but a lousy actor, a bland presence throughout and he is never sure whether to overact or underplay because the performance is a mess of both. Julianne Hough is beautiful, but doesn't have the confidence, vulnerability or charm to match.Andie McDowell feels out of place and, with the lack of engagement with her material, looks completely cost. Dennis Quaid gives a limp and sometimes over-compensated performance, and constantly looks ill at ease. There is little chemistry between the two of them as well, the dignity and gentle touch from the original's chemistry between the two characters is missed, replaced with a sense of being condemned throughout.Overall, there's worse out there but there was really not needed and the execution on its own merits is severely wanting. 3/10 Bethany Cox",3.0,Anonymous,Music
"Footloose is about more than dancing, although Kenny Wormwald certainly can do that.","Footloose is about more than dancing, although Kenny Wormwald certainly can do that. Footloose is a classic tale of tragedy and redemption, about the differences between teens and adults, about the way we see ourselves and others. Craig Brewer has managed to update this classic film without losing one iota of the feel of the original. Kenny Wormwald is excellent as Ren, the out of town boy thrust into the small country town environment. Julianne Hough plays the minister's daughter with a flair that shows some insight into the dynamics of a family dealing with the loss of a child. Dennis Quaid and Andie MacDowell were perfect choices for the minister and his wife, and Quaid adds a different perspective to the role than Lithgow's original portrayal. Ray McKinnon gives us a new look at his ability to adapt his normally more aggressive character acting to a kinder, gentler advocate, and Kim Dickens provides just the right touch as the aunt. Very appealing were the characters of Willard and Rusty, played by newcomers Miles Teller and Ziah Colon. Filmed in the small town of Acworth, Georgia, the photography and cinematography are excellent. Rated PG-13 for language, sexual content, and some violence and drug use, this is a film, with correct parental supervision, should be viewable by the entire family. Collectible?

An Okay Remake... Which Fails Slightly Because It's A Near Duplicate...,"This is pretty much a straight photocopy of the original film, though, with a few extras thrown in and a couple of new ideas.I liked the fact that the opening sequence is similar to the original. Initially, I was a little confused with the similarity but then the twist kicks in. It turns out to be the dance where the teenagers lose their lives and start the No-Dance Law. However, the parallels didn't stop at the start. Though I have to be grateful that the ""Tractor Chicken"" scene was changed out for the bus demolition derby. This added a nice bit of excitement. Though the cover of Holding Out For A Hero was atrocious.Actually, Craig Brewer's direction is crisper than the first film, though it has less iconic moments as he just duplicated them. By doing this they lose some of their power. For example, Ren's ""Dance-Angry"" scene in the abandoned barn. When Kevin Bacon did it you thought, wow, this guy is angry, look at those moves, and what attitude. Now, when Kenny Wormald does the ""Dance-Angry"", even with the added moves and different camera angles you don't get the same thoughts... you're too busy thinking of Kev - sorry Ken.This happens a few times throughout the movie. Though ""Let's Hear It For The Boy"" was a nice touch. I even preferred this version of the Reverend. Dennis Quaid gives a quieter and more controlled portrayal than John Lithgow (who was brilliant as the over-powering version). Quaid's Reverend is more fitting for this film.In fact, I liked most of this cast. Julianne Hough's Ariel is a little dirtier and more wild-child than Lori Singer's. Though Singer's and Bacon's on-screen chemistry was better and more believable. The best casting decision was Miles Teller as Willard. He fits the country-hick better than Christopher Penn did. He's also not as wooden as Penn was - a great bonus, as I didn't feel embarrassed for him when he came on-screen. I just have one question though, why did Andie MacDowell take this part. It's tiny and not that important. MacDowell doesn't bring anything to the part. Any other actress could have done better. While writing this review I realised I'd truly forgotten she'd even starred in the film - thank you IMDb for the cast list.I still prefer the original than this one, though only just. This is still a kick-ass rock-and-roll dance-to-live movie, which I found highly enjoyable. So if you like this sort of thing, give it a try - you shouldn't be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

I saw it multiple times up the theatre and on cable and got the original soundtrack on vinyl (kids--ask your parents!)and then again on CD. I was dreading this remake but it's actually pretty OK. It starts GREAT with a bunch of kids dancing very well to the title tune and basically follows the original script. Some of the dialogue is lifted verbatim from the original! Still there are plenty of changes--there are plenty of dramatic scenes that weren't in the original, the chicken game with tractors is turned into a race between four buses (!!!), some of the songs are (unwisely) replaced with rap songs and the dancing has changed. ""Holding Out for a Hero"" is heard once in the background and ""Somebody's Eyes"" was used when Willard (Miles Tenner) learns how to dance--but most of the songs from the original were left out. Also there's more swearing here and the fights between the teenagers are pretty brutal (for a PG-13). The acting isn't bad. Wormald is just an OK actor but he can really dance unlike Kevin Bacon in the original. He's a handsome guy too. Hough is beautiful as Ariel (LOVE those eyes) and she can act AND sing:) Everybody else is OK in their roles especially Quaid as the reverend.

"Despite not having a reason to actually exist, Footloose entertains and captures the charm of the original.","As a cynical movie writer, all the lines were ready to go once the chance to review Footloose finally arrived: ""It's a BLT without the Bacon"", ""1980s cheddar is already old, now molding thirty years later."", and ""(Insert rant on Hollywood remakes here)"".But damn-it, the Footloose remake doesn't suck; even if it has no reason to exist.In the hands of director Craig Brewer, Footloose manages to overcome a one note plot (which was apart of the original as well), potentially obnoxious covers of the original soundtrack, and pulls out memorable performances from each of its leads.The Footloose remake doesn't make any major changes to the plot line of the original, which essentially boils down to kids being legally prohibited to dance because of a car crash where several teenagers tragically died (they say drink responsibly in the TV ads... isn't that enough?)Apparently, an epic fail of that size just can't go unpunished by forcing everyone who wants to dance to keep those moves at home – where they belong. Despite the law, young Ren McCormack (Kenny Wormald) is determined to shake things up and get his boogie on. Along the way, he'll attempt to woo the reverend's daughter, Ariel Shaw (Julianne Hough), while also taking down the preacher man himself (Dennis Quaid) at the city council.The plot is laughable, cheesy, and amazingly Brewer manages to make it seem dramatic. No, there's never really a scene that moves past shallow, but there are moments where Hough and Wormald are able to engage in real emotions that have back-story and plausible reasoning. It's an accomplishment that should probably be awarded with an Oscar, but alas, it's not that kind of award show.Among the many triumphs of Footloose, first and foremost is the dancing. It's simply stunning to watch, and is a mixture of step by step reproducing the original dance moves, and adding a new flare as well. The music is the same combination of old and new, and doesn't miss a step (except for the fact that Kenny Loggins's original Footloose plays during the opening scene where the aforementioned teenagers crash -- an obvious and egregious mixing of separate universes).Special note should also be given to Miles Teller , who plays Willard, originally portrayed by Chris Penn. It seems blasphemous to say, but Teller is as charming as Penn was in 1984. It's once again proof that Brewer knew exactly what he was doing with this project, and each gamble paid off. Brewer didn't pull any punches (or slaps for that matter) in his attempt to update Footloose for the MTV generation err from the MTV generation.Okay, the whole MTV generation thing is confusing. Brewer achieves the update however, despite everything working against him, managing to gives the audience something between a choking laugh and a smile.OverallCasting two professional dancers in the lead roles turned out to be a winning decision in regards to dramatic elements, as well as the physical/musical ones. it's a shame that Footloose has to exist in the world, but now that it does, this reviewer is okay with it. Strip away all the years of Saturday night on TNT love for the original, and Footloose (2011) is just as exciting, cheesy, and engaging as the original (even without the Bacon).On the SideIt's nice to see Dennis Quaid in a role that he doesn't phone in. Still, he's borderline. Maybe he just Skyped it in this time.",,Anonymous,Music
Fun enough for a Saturday night at the movies. Or cheap ass Tuesday.,"Footloose is mindless entertainment with an attractive cast which is easy to watch and will have you wanting to strap on some cowboy boots and join a line dancing troupe, it really is just a fun movie that doesn't exceed any expectations but is still highly enjoyable. It is very loyal to the original film which brings to mind the question of why remake it at all? Well it has been modernized to suit todays teenagers and it still works well storyline wise.The cast is pretty good, Kenny Wormald is great to watch and is a very handsome leading man who i can't wait to watch again, mighty fine eye candy indeed, the female lead however is horrible, the character is just a detestable b**ch, i didn't like her one tiny bit, her character somewhat redeems herself towards the end but for me it was just too late, but i suppose thats not the actress's fault but still she is easily the most unlikable female character ever in a teen film.One thing i loved about this movie is it is a dance movie with a country theme, the country soundtrack is excellent, it's nice to see a mainstream film that doesn't use contemporary dance to tell the story, here it's all boot scootin' and honky tonkin'.The only thing that really disappointed me was the lack of a Kevin Bacon cameo, surely they could've written a small role for him, even just a blink and you'll miss walk on role, oh well.So if you don't ask any questions and sit back and turn off your mind this movie can be very enjoyable.

Great At What It Does,"As one of the few people on this earth who has never laid eyes upon the original 1984 ""Footloose"", I came into this version with no preconceived notions or expectations. As such, I was pleasantly surprised, although not outright blown away.For a basic plot summary, ""Footloose 2011"" is a typical ""teens vs. adults"" flick. When a car crash (after a night of partying) kills five high school seniors, their community pastor (played by Dennis Quaid) restricts future teenage rebellious behavior by controlling the town with strict laws/curfews. That is, of course, until his daughter (Julianne Hough) meets the new kid in town from Boston (Kenny Wormald) and the town gets stirred up once again.The prevailing factor in this film experience is that the movie is good at what it does. It provides everything that one expects to see, such as: incredible dancing, popular music, attractive men/women, and teen-centered plots. All those things are accomplished with aplomb.An ""added bonus"" is the quality of acting from both the youngsters and adults (especially Quaid) in the film. Though inherently a bit hokey, this movie could have diverged into pure cheeseball without such strong performances.Thus, while I can't give it an enormous star rating because it isn't an outright classic, it is very good at what it does (and if you like that kind of thing, your rating will be much higher). Three and a half stars would probably be a more exact ranking. Simply put, I had a good time watching this flick.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
this movie is awful,"Bad music (how was he inspired to do that warehouse routine to whatever that music was? I wasn't inspired to check the soundtrack list. I'm not against using ""modern"" music, but it needs to sound good and have a dance-able beat!) Julianne Hough seems to be about 30 with her cheerleader-worn voice, over-tan, and strip-pole dance moves (no, dad shouldn't be upset when he comes in the room to find me faux-effing some guy I barely know, who's a different guy than the one I've actually been effing{well, they left that kind of vague in the door-pulled-down scene, and when she was asked point-blank about it}- who appears to be around 30 as well, and she's a high-school student? 17 or 18? Nobody questioned that? potential statutory rape. Or the glossing over of her being beaten by him?) The lead WAS a brat, and I agree with another reviewer, completely unremarkable/memorable. boring! thankfully I saw it on DVD so I could fast-forward a lot, esp. the completely contrived and time-fill scene with the buses etc. on the racetrack. These kids actually WERE misbehaving! not just being screwed by over protective parents. As cheesy as much of it is, see the original instead. There can't be a spoiler because it's an almost complete remake (they barely tried to modernize it!) and because nothing happens.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Footloose,"If your foot is loose, you may have leprosy. If you have leprosy, dancing could cause your foot to fly off and kick someone in the face.Fortunately, the limbs of the youngsters in this drama have been checked for lesions.When his mother dies, Ren (Kenny Wormald) moves to a small-town to live with his relatives.Unfamiliar with the town's ban on dancing, Ren runs afoul of the reverend (Dennis Quaid), whose son was killed in a car crash after an unsanctioned soirée, and whose daughter (Julianne Hough) Ren can't stop thinking about.Intent on cutting a rug, Ren and the teens of the totalitarian township team up to lift the draconian dance laws.Though it never strays from the original's shadow, this shot-for-shot remake does do an admirable job of including soundtrack standouts.Besides, if God didn't want us to dance, why would he give us booties?

The best remake I've ever seen,"Hands down, the 2011 Footloose is the best remake I've ever seen. In the traditional definition, a story is re-filmed and re-released. There's nothing in Webster's that necessitates a fresh take, although most remakes try to put their own spin on the story. How often have you gone to see a remake and been thoroughly disappointed that scene was cut, entire characters were written out, the modern time period makes the story inaccessible, or someone in the cast tries to say his or her lines the total opposite of how the original did? In Footloose, every single thing is exactly the same as it was in 1984. You can probably count on your right hand the differences, and they're all very minor. The ""chicken"" game with the tractors is replaced by a figure-eight chase with school buses. See? Not that big a deal.The script is almost identical. ""Do you want to kiss me?"" ""Someday."" ""What's all this someday s***?"" Every song and sequence is included, and Lynne Taylor-Corbett's original choreography is faithfully stuck to. The costumes are same, too, with the white tank top, the tie on the first day of school, the burgundy tux jacket, the pink fluttery prom dress, and the ""Dance Your A** Off"" t-shirt! This is truly a remake, redoing a film for modern audiences so they can watch stars they know in roles their parents remember from thirty years earlier. Your mom talks about Kevin Bacon and Lori Singer, but you'll tell your kids about Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough. Your mom giggles incessantly and gets a lump in her throat when Chris Penn learns to dance, and you'll do the same with Miles Teller. John Lithgow and Dianne Wiest are replaced by Dennis Quaid and Andie MacDowell, whom kids today think of as ""parent-age"" instead of young and beautiful '80s stars.There's only one person I wouldn't recommend watching this movie. If you're that person who thinks a remake is only good if it changes the original and adds its own spin on it, don't rent Footloose. Wait until West Side Story comes out and have your fill. As for me, I probably won't go to the theaters to see the remake of West Side Story. I'll be too busy watching the DVD I just bought of Footloose.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Footloose (2011) - We Have to Cut Loose! ""Foot-loose""!","Although I have never seen the original ""Footloose"" with Kevin Bacon, the remake helped me quite understand the movie a lot. Before talking about the obvious plot, I would like to say that ""Footloose"" made me entertained by the dancing, the casting, and the true heart, but sometimes not the plot, which goes as follows. After a terrible teenage car crash three years ago, due to dancing and loud music, the court has decided to have dancing banned in their city. Then, some random Boston boy starts to make a change when he tries his best to bring dancing back to the city. Now, that sounds like an interesting and enjoying plot, the only problem is that it's just so unrealistic. Why would dancing be illegal for no particular reason? I have no idea, but here's what I do know, it sounds like a bad idea! But besides that, I kind of enjoyed the movie a lot. The dancing was completely entertaining, and it helped keep the movie alive. The dancing is well-choreographed, and it's staged perfectly to the theme. Kenny Wormald makes a pretty-well portrayal in the movie as Ren McCormack, the boy who tries to bring dancing alive again. I felt everything that he brought to the character, and he dances like a pro. The beautiful, butt-busting Julianne Hough does an even brilliant job in the movie playing the preacher's daughter, Ariel. She does a terrific job acting in this movie, with her full optimism and golden attitude, except in the more emotional scenes where she delivers no feeling of emotion. Dennis Quaid does brilliant work as the preacher, and Andie MacDowell does pretty good work in the movie as well. But another problem with the film was watching all the teenagers finding themselves into deep trouble, acting like complete idiots with abusive boyfriends, and crazy bus races. To me, that was completely silly. Although there's an unrealistic plot to ""Footloose"", there is a realistic, golden heart to ""Footloose"". The movie talks about cutting loose, and teenagers should be let free, and all that realistic humor. Director Craig Brewer has brought a golden touch to this movie, to be traditional to the original classic. Oh, and let's not forget the cool soundtrack, including the song of the same name as the movie that gets stuck in your head, and you don't want to let it go. ""Footloose"" maybe a movie with a plot that's too unrealistic and cliché, but the dancing, the cast, and the heartwarming moments helped me become entertained throughout the whole thing. If you like to party and cut loose, you won't be disappointed with this movie. ""Footloose"", in my review, ""non-stop rocking entertainment, but with no sense of realism"".",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Well done!,"I think there could have been more dancing, but there was a lot more than the original. If you don't know Juliana then you need to turn your TV on! She was also in Burlesque. She is a very talented dancer and I think she was the perfect person for this part. I would have liked to seen her dance with Zac Efron, but if he's going to get a big head about it, I'm glad they got Kenny Wormald instead. He did a great job. I think they could have done more with his dance scene in the warehouse. They added a few more characters and that was good. If you like musicals then you will like this. If you don't, why do you even bother going? Miles Tyler was very good. Somewhat like the original character. Adding the young girls in to teach him to dance was very cute.Overall, very entertaining.",,Anonymous,Music
horrible movie and acting,"I have not seen the original so I'm basing my opinion on just this film, and it was awful. First Julianna Hough and Kenny Wormald are horrible actors. Yes, they can dance, but giving them speaking parts equals bad idea. Second, a movie about dancing should have a great sound trak and this one was terrible. The only good song was Footloose, which of course is from the original. There's also some kind of rap/dance song in which Hough looks like a slut. I mean, she is supposed to play a high school girl, and she is wiggling all over these guys very suggestively, it's just gross and inappropriate for a movie aimed at teens. Lastly, the plot is nonexistent. It's about a town that has banned dancing. Can anyone say snooze fest.FINAL VERDICT: Not worth anyone's time.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Faithful but not upgrade,"As far as remakes go, you cannot be much more faithful than this. It takes an absolute classic movie and updates it in all aspects from music to cast. The movie hits all the same beats as the original. So as far as most of the plot it is just as good. The dancing in my opinion is more well choreographed this time but even still there doesn't seem to be that special. I do have to appreciate the fact that they kept in pretty much every iconic quote from the 9184 version. Footloose was already a 4/5 star good movie but this as a remake, while faithful, is not quite as well done (acted among other things) as that original.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Julianne Hough is just as Bad as Jessica ALba,"This film could have been an improvement on the campy original. However it failed once they cast Julianne Hough.

The wreck that was talked about in the original is shown here.Denis Quaid is not a good choice to laying the preacher. In real life he is known for being a huge drunk with stints in rehab. His own persona overwhelms his part here.In general this film was just bad from the idea of it to the casting. Julianne Hough needs to take acting classes.

A remake that's as good as the original.,"Now this is what I'm talking about! A remake made by people who obviously love the original (it's packed with nifty visual and aural tributes to the 1984 film) without being enslaved to it. From the terrific opening credit sequence on, this is non-stop entertainment - getting the guy who directed BLACK SNAKE MOAN and HUSTLE AND FLOW to reboot FOOTLOOSE was a brilliant idea, as he perfectly combines his own preoccupations (mainly having to do with his continuing examination of the American south) with the structure of the original to make a film that's both personal expression and mainstream entertainment. Everyone who's hating on this based on the teaser should keep an open mind - after all, thou shalt not judge a film by its trailer. Far from being a STEP UP retread (as many people who haven't seen it have theorized), this is a movie with a diverse range of music and a gorgeous visual style - and having the hottest chick on earth in the female lead doesn't hurt.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Totally and Utterly Disappointing!,"Last night, me and my siblings were surfing around Netflix looking for something to watch. We found the 2011 remake of Footloose and thought, ""Eh, what the heck?"" So we watched it.Biggest mistake ever.This movie is not only a pointless remake of a hallowed cinematic classic, it's just boring as a stand-alone movie. The film offered no redeeming qualities - none whatsoever. Even the dance sequences left me groaning and begging for the original (After completing the film, I went to YouTube and purged the old one out of me by watching the dance scenes from the original).In particular, Kenny Wormald as Ren was singularly a bad choice. His performance left me wishing for Kevin Bacon (who, ironically, recently appeared on the Tonight Show for a comedic reprisal of his Footloose role). At one point, my father walked by and commented, ""He looks like a ventriloquist dummy!""Julianne Hough was also terrible as Ariel. She lacked the flirty, fun, mystery revolving around the original character. Her performance was dry, and her emotions were faked.One of the worst parts about this movie was Dennis Quaid as the pastor. His performance left me literally crying in agony. I have never seen such a terrible reprisal of a role. He was dry, stereotypical, and lacked all the emotion of John Lithgow's original character.Probably one of this film's only redeeming qualities was Willard, played by Miles Teller. In his surprisingly endearing performance, Miles Teller puts forth at least a decent acting effort.Not much else good can be said about this film update. If you get the itch for a good dance movie, this is NOT the one for you. Better to find and watch the classic original and not bother",3.0,Anonymous,Music

It is more than likely harder to find a place in the US that would have an ordinance against music and dancing. But many locations maintain a noise ordinance.

"Hewing a little too slavishly close to the original, this remake is nonetheless a surprisingly character-driven drama that possesses the exuberant spirit of the 1984 classic","What's the indie director of gritty pulp fare like 'Hustle and Flow' and 'Black Snake Moan' doing at the helm of a '80s teenage movie remake? Well frankly we were not quite sure till we caught his updated version of 'Footloose', and realised that director and co-writer Craig Brewer saw something much more within the original that went beyond the regular 'Step Up', 'Stomp the Yard' and 'StreetDance' modern-day teen-dance movies.Like those films, 'Footloose' is about celebrating the spirit of youth through the freedom of movement, so expect the characters to speak passionately about how dancing isn't just a frivolous activity, or worse still an act of rebellion against authority. But while these other films were simply content to wow their audiences with some spectacular dance moves, Brewer surprisingly places story and character front and centre, using dance only as a device to either.Beginning with a toe-tapping prologue set to a hip-hop version of Kenny Loggins' title tune, Brewer and his co-writer Dean Pitchford (who was behind the 1984 original) kicks things off with a literal bang when five teenagers are killed in a road accident after a night out partying and most importantly dancing. Among the dead is the son of Rev. Shaw Moore (Dennis Quaid), a preacher in the small town of Bomont, who believes the act is a test from the Lord and exhorts the local community to put its young people under curfew and ban loud music and public dancing.Even from these opening minutes, it is clear that Brewer's writing possesses admirable finesse- and instead of the fire and brimstone we would expect from a caricatured depiction of a Southern preacher, we get the deeply personal words of Rev. Moore that ring with the agony and grief of a parent. Into this restrictive environment enters big-city kid Ren McCormick (newcomer Kenny Wormald), who has returned to stay with his aunt and uncle after burying his mother.Ren's first brush with the strictures of the town is getting fined for cranking the music in his yellow VW bug too loudly, and let's just say that his reputation with the adult townsfolk just goes downhill from there. Those familiar with the original will start noticing the similarities between Brewer's update and its source- the yellow VW for one, and also the Rev Moore's rebellious daughter Ariel (Julianne Hough) who is not quite the same after her brother's death.Exchanging tractors in the original for racecars, the modern-day Ariel still lives on the edge by dating a local racing lout Chuck (Patrick John Flueger), but is immediately drawn to Ren following a clandestine dance session at an outdoor movie theatre. Ren and Ariel's mutual attraction fuels the tension at the heart of the story, first between Ren and Chuck as romantic rivals who duke it out in a dirt-track race using modified school buses, and then later between Ren and the Rev. Moore who sees Ariel's errant ways as a result of Ren's bad influence.It takes a while for Brewer to set up these characters and their relationships, so expect the first hour- that also contains the jealous boyfriend element which kinda falls flat- to be less fleet-footed than you would expect. Nonetheless, the pace picks up considerably once Ren decides to start a petition to end the law against public dancing, which also puts him on a direct collision course with Rev. Moore. The dynamic between these two characters is especially interesting- one the father grieving over the loss of his son; and the other a son grieving over the loss of his mother- and a scene where they come to mutual understanding of their common circumstances is deeply poignant.But Brewer doesn't forget he's making a commercial product, not one of his specialty films, so he hasn't left out the obligatory comic relief that comes in the form of Ren's awkwardly shy best buddy Willard (Miles Teller). Deserving of special mention, Teller delivers a charmingly goofy performance radically different from his last appearance in 'Rabbit Hole' that is about as endearing as it gets. The hilarity is fortunate, for the dance sequences, while well integrated into the flow of the story, are quite forgettable- even the 'angry dance' replicated from the original by Ren at an abandoned warehouse after being wrongfully accused of drug possession. Choreographer Jamal Sims still makes these sequences look good on screen, but there isn't anything on display that will make you go 'wow'.Bland is also the same description that can be used with lead actor Wormald, who could very well do with a little more of the film's own advice of cutting loose. Playing Ren all too straight-laced, there is too little of the brashness and insouciance in his performance that is required of his character. Hough fares much better, the 'Dancing with the Stars' alum absolutely luminous and sexy as Ariel in clothes so tight that 'if you put a quarter in her back pocket you can tell whether it's heads or tails'. Still, Wormald and Hough have good chemistry together, both of them better dancers than they are actors.Of course, given the uncharacteristically character-driven approach Brewer has taken with the material, one wishes for better lead actors to play Ren and Ariel. Yet there is still much to enjoy about this remake of a generation's classic, which is a surprisingly solid movie with strong story and character elements. And though it is true his version veers closely to the original, it is clear that Brewer has taken great effort to craft a remake that pays homage to its source while introducing the 'Footloose' revolution to a new generation. It may not get to its feet as often as you would want it to, but its spirit of living out loud and cutting it loose is still very much alive.www.moviexclusive.com",,Anonymous,Music

The Footloose soundtrack is iconic, and they made the horrible choice of making the songs country. Footloose, Holding Out For a Hero, and Let's Here It For The Boy are all country covers, and it sounds horrible.

"Cut loose! A movie that is, unbelievably, better than the original.","You do realize that once you remake a film, there is no going back. That happened when I saw the original and remake of ""Hairspray"". My hand is somewhat going to shame, because there is a remake of ""Dirty Dancing"" coming out soon. The originals, of course, are always better. Now I realize you can't remake a 1984 classic starring Kevin Bacon called ""Footloose"", but there you go. I have seen the original and even though I found some scenes slow, the rest of the movie and the dancing scenes were terrific. For Craig Brewer, the director who made ""Hustle & Flow"" and ""Black Snake Moan"", he was a fan of this movie and he wanted to do a remake that would stay true to the original film. For it to be released during the ""Step Up"" era, who would've thunk it that the new ""Footloose"" is a genuine surprise, a remake that is unbelievably better than the original. Some has changed, but not a lot. And the remake doesn't feel slow, it just moves fast. It's simple: Start with a small town called Bomont, Georgia, where the town's council has banned public dancing, teen drinking and music. Enter a kid from Boston named Ren MacCormack (back-up dancer Kenny Wormald) who comes to Bomont in order to shake things up. He makes a friend in Willard (the scene-stealing Miles Teller in the late Chris Penn role) and the sexy and rebellious red-boots-wearing Ariel (Julianne Hough), daughter of Reverend Shaw Moore (Dennis Quaid in the John Lithgow role), girlfriend of the stuck-up Redneck Chuck Cranston (Patrick John Flueger). What Ren does is challenge the town in order to remove the law of banning public dancing and music. Only then he realizes that once you make a change, everything you know will start to change you. And there's no going back to that. The remake of ""Footloose"" does have a couple non-fatal glitches into the system, but the dancing (including the Angry Dance, the ""Let's Hear It For The Boy"" montage and the ""Footloose"" finale) are awesome and the young actors are terrific, especially Wormald and Hough. They're not Kevin Bacon or Lori Singer, but they sure hold their own and their amazing dancing abilities. Let's leave it at this, this movie made me want to cut loose.

Saw Advance Screening of Brewer's Footloose- Outstanding.,"I was not expecting a great film, to be perfectly honest. The original was fun, but silly, a big wad of bubble gum for the brain. Its plot was silly, its characters were anemically underdeveloped, but it was fun. Silly fun, but fun.Craig Brewer's remake kept the fun--- No, improved upon the fun, but featured fully developed characters that were deserving of whatever empathy the audience can give them.For the first time, you get to see what drives these characters. What makes this dance, this fight, so important to Ren? What makes Ariel the self-destructive party girl? But the biggest character improvement has to be Rev. Shaw. John Lithgow did a great job in the original, making you hate him the beginning and feel empathy for the changes he goes through along the way. But Dennis Quaid's version of the same character tugs at the heartstrings from his first moment on screen and never loses his humanity in quite the same way. Just as in the original, Ren McCormick is the McGuffin--- The thing that it's about that it's not really about. Footloose is really the story of Rev. Shaw's struggle to become a better man and better father.I cannot heap enough praise on the cast. Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough were utterly remarkable as Ren and Ariel, transforming them into characters that are easy to care about. Ariel was annoying in the original; The remake has you pleading ""Will someone please help this lost child?"" Miles Teller very nearly steals the show, as his predecessor Chris Penn did. Ziah Colon plays Ariel's friend Rusty as a character rather the prop that she was in the original. And Ray McKinnon put on a scene-stealing performance as Ren's Uncle Wes.Don't let the character development lead you to believe that the pace is slower, or that it is less fun. To the contrary, Brewer has made a very fun, fast paced movie.The true difference is this: The original film was quite content to treat its southern characters as rednecks, people to be made fun of. You don't laugh with those characters. You laugh AT them.Brewer is a Tennessean (Which is why I was lucky enough to catch this screening in Memphis) and truly loves the South. And he never allowed his characters to devolve into caricatures.If there is any justice, this will be one of the bigger films this year. I cannot recommend it highly enough. I saw an early cut--- Brewer said before the screening that there were three audio cues that were to be recut, and the closing credits were not finished.But make no mistake, I will see it again when it opens.",,Anonymous,Music

A Musical Without the Music: What's the Point?,"I was pretty disappointed with this version of Footloose. What makes Footloose such an enjoyable movie/musical is the music. Aside from a brief incorporation of the title song in the beginning, and a couple of the songs used as background music throughout the movie, this movie neglected its musical roots altogether! What a waste...There were some fun dance scenes but I found myself unable to enjoy them fully because of the blatant display of Julianne Hough's sexuality. I have some words to say to the costume designer. To be fair, her character was supposed to look and act like a slut. Still, I found that the powers at be went overboard with that depiction in this version.Kenny Wormald was a likable protagonist, Ren. His sidekick, Willard, played by Miles Teller was utterly preposterous however. I felt sorry for people who live in small towns in Georgia.

Seen 'Em Both. Love 'Em Both.,"Sure, I wasn't around for the Footloose hype (if there was ever one) of the 1980s when the original movie came out, but alas, I did see it. I have also seen the remake. And I believe them to be great movies!I just got back from the theater, actually, and found the film to be quite enjoyable! It's great fun! But not for all ages. A bit too raunchy for the little kids that want to get up and start singing.Story tells of Ren McCormick wanting to oppose the law of no dancing in the town of Boumont. The plot is a little flat throughout most of the movie, but the great cast seems to make this movie a worthwhile entertainment ride!Now, the movie doesn't have as much dancing, but I will give it that Kenny Wormald really has amazing dance moves! And Julianne Hough (known as a country singer) has some great acting chops! Especially in the scene with her Reverend dad, played by Dennis Quaid.It's a little too raunchy for parents to bring their kids to. Lots of sexual themes and language. But if anyone is looking for a film to just smile at, this is your movie!But the real talent goes to Miles Teller, the dimwitted redneck, Willard. Every line that he had, the audience in the theater would just burst out into laughter! The funniest/best scene of the movie is arguably where the girls are teaching him how to dance, and he starts to dance everywhere!Great movie! 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A trip down memory lane,"As far as remakes go this movie was purely a trip down memory lane for those of us old enough to have seen the original in it's day. This cuts as a double edge sword to the quality though. It was great and refreshing to see a movie remake that totally follows the original and introduces it to a younger audience, but it also is kind of a let down to not see a lot of updates and an original take that could have made it much more interesting. The acting was sub par at best with the exception of Julianna Hough, who was a great choice in the role originally played by Lori Singer. I give this remake 6 stars because of its nostalgia but most of the cast was a bore, the ""gymnast aspect is too dated ( in 1984 it was an OK aspect because of the Olympic hype following Mary Lou Retton's perfect 10 ). Other than that its scene by scene and almost line by lines dependence on the original just doesn't deliver in this day and age and it is rather boring to watch an entire film that you have already seen many times before.Depite its lack of an original updated take, it still is a must see at least for us that grew up on the original, and for those of us that have a crush on the All-American beauty that is Julianna Hough.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
a good remake,"I liked the film.It stayed true to the original. Dancing is well done, and not contrived. Leads look great. All the actors do a very good job. Some dance scenes remind me of (but are nothing like) the dance scene in the Breakfast Club, which helps to set the upbeat tone. It's a feel good movie.Things that let it down are: the father/daughter relationship was not so believable. The pointless fight scene at the end. And the opening outline. Too much emotional drama is layered on after the tragedy without the audience forming any bond with the characters. Also the movie is a little slow to get going.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Is the remake better?,"Well, if I hadn't seen the remake before the original I would have been more impressed with the original. Seeing them back to back the 2011 version is in my opinion a better movie. But if I had seen the original movie first, there is not enough reason for a remake. Same play, different actors. They didn't even bother with a new script, same lines with just a tweak or two.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

"In the end, producers what shouldn't be touched much and left intact what, on the contrary, needed a deep revision. At least, music and dance are great and let all funnier","It's difficult to specify how society in the 1980s faced the plot of ""Footloose"", but it leads one to believe that, at least in the second decade of the 21st century, the premise sounds quite outdated and somewhat implausible (although it was originally inspired by real circumstances): in an inner city in the United States, listening to loud music and dancing in public violates a law passed with the support of the local religious leadership - something that arouses special discomfort and anger in a young man who has just moved to the surroundings. On the other hand, it is perfectly possible to see the plot as a metaphor for the harmful advance of religion in politics and in other matters that do not concern it - and in this sense, the thematic relevance of the film in the present day is undeniable.Of course, a long distance separates the children's bans of the city of Bomont from poignant subjects that the Church insists on giving its opinion, such as abortion or gay marriage - which is evident in the scenes in which the protagonist exposes the silly motivations of his campaign for the repeal of the laws (protecting the right to enjoy one's youth and being able to promote some effective change, after dedicating oneself in vain to the mother's leukemia treatment). However, with a minimum of good will, it is possible to perceive the correctness of the script regarding the discussion, from the way in which Ren MacCormack (Kenny Wormald) exposes the accommodation of his uncle Wes (Ray McKinnon) in relation to the influence of religious conservatism in the routine from the city to the passage in which the protagonist uses excerpts from the bible itself to refute the intolerance of the city council.Adapting the story to the present day through references to the recession or more contemporary music and choreography (although several of the great songs from the original feature are present), the remake ends up inheriting from the 1984 film the silly love triangle that punctuates the dramatic arc of Ren - and both the bus race and the fight near the end, both motivated by the actions of the cartoonish villain Chuck (Patrick John Flueger), sound like events outside the central plot. And although the script rarely reaches a respectable dramatic weight, the performance of the cast is nonetheless satisfactory: dancer Kenny Wormald demonstrates commitment as an actor and, in addition to performing the dance scenes with excellence, he gives charisma to MacCormack (played in the original version by Kevin Bacon), while Julianne Hough's performance does not compromise the rebellious Ariel - and the actress even does better in the role than in her participation in the musical ""Rock of Ages - The Movie"". Finally, Dennis Quaid (""A Good Match"") lives a Reverend Shaw Moore softer than John Lithgow's original, although he expresses the intolerance, conservatism and conflicts of the subject efficiently.There are many things about the first ""Footloose"" that, seen today, it would be unreasonable to think. Twenty-something years ago, a city boy interrupting the quiet life of a repressive, repressed, highly religious town in deep America was a topic of interest with more to read between the lines than one might a priori imagine. It's not that he discovered gunpowder, but he offered it to an audience that might never have heard of it before. The boy in question was a still unknown Kevin Bacon, and his effort in the city was to overthrow the laws that subjugated his people, whose young people were even forbidden to dance. Because dancing, you know, is the devil's invention. Of course, today, this speech is very old. Fortunately, nowadays things are not as they used to be and, although nobody doubts the weight of religion in society (or its value for those who profess it), it may be more difficult to believe that the inhabitants of a western environment accept what the priest on duty tells them as an absolute and inviolable law. There will still be somewhere, yes, but of course, the ending of the first version doesn't seem to make much sense today. That's why it was really interesting to see what social element was brought in as a plot excuse this time around; like, after all, a justified mid-2011 remake of something like that. Something that, incidentally, still has thousands of fans that you have to be careful with. Be that as it may, its creators got it wrong from start to finish.And it is that they reversed things. If there is something genuine that is easily seen, whether in its time, today or a hundred years from now, it is the dances, with their simple choreographies, but effective and plausible in such a hermetic city, in addition to being extremely captivating. On the other hand, the only way to tolerate everything today is through its retro, naive, camp, or simply throwback element. Without that ingredient, ""Footloose"" would have been as indigestible as any of the other similar films at the time. And Footloose (2011) does not. Therefore, a change of premise would be necessary, a new approach. Because if you don't have it, you go from innocence to incredible, from retro to old-fashioned... And from undisciplined to retarded. It's incomprehensible that not an iota of its structure has been altered, including a boy who can't dance and Ren's final speech (about the relationship between dance and youth and the Church). On the contrary, the points that were least needed were reinforced, softening even more the final sensations: now there is a first car accident that justifies, in the easiest way, the behavior of the priest (Dennis Quaid replacing John Lithgow) and the people in general.Instead, they touched each other and much more than they feared, which worked perfectly (okay, not perfectly either, but almost). The dances by Bacon, Lori Singer, Chris Penn, Sarah Jessica Parker and company were good, already commented here that they were realistic, sounded natural, and were well implemented in the plot. When the Ren McCormack of the 1980s gets angry and goes to dance in the factory where he works, his anger, his effusion and his sweat come out. And it deforms as an improvised reaction, given that the terms improvisation and musical are mutually exclusive. In the new Footloose, none of that: the fact that breakdancing and reggaeton have done great damage to society is reflected in countless things, but one of them is the Hollywood mania for putting the two in any place that requires a couple of dance steps. And the result here is an impossible pastiche: that a redneck town (the word redneck itself sometimes sounds) in deep America does choreography and bluster of that caliber, when, moreover, its neighbors haven't danced in three years because, the law forbids it. Literally nowhere to take. As there is no way to understand that a man, however devoted to religion he may be, is still surprised that we now ""carry computers in our pockets"" or that, that, that dancing is bad. Sinful, even.In short, the makers of Footloose (2011) understood absolutely nothing about what it means to remake. Some basic changes were made, maybe to bring an atmosphere of a more current time, like putting a scene with a kind of funk dance and rap, or in the dispute scene using a racing bus instead of a tractor. What matters is that the country dance scene works in both films, there is no one who doesn't enjoy watching it. In the 2011 remake, we better understand the reasons for the city banning dancing, right in the first scene, as well as the trauma of the protagonist with the death of his mother due to leukemia. Again, what matters is that the scene in the shed also works in both films, both actors give a show of performance in the dance. In the remake, the cool thing is that the character misses a few steps and even falls to the ground. Actors Kevin Bacon and Kenny Wormald perform a choreography show, as a way to cool off and resolve their traumatic issues by dancing alone in a forgotten shed. Not to mention the fun scene where he teaches his redneck friend Willard to dance (played by Chris Penn in the original and Miles Teller in the remake).In both productions, the songs match the scenes presented and the country style was perfect for the small-town redneck style. The theme music from the original opens and closes the films in an exciting way, starting the film showing only the feet and dance steps, and later we see many scenes of well-choreographed dance. We can't forget the songs ""Footloose"" (by Kenny Loggins) and ""Let's Hear It for the Boy"" (by Deniece Williams), essential to the film's success, so much so that they were kept in the 2011 version received an Oscar nomination for best original song. The soundtrack features Tom Snow, Dean Pitchford, Kenny Loggins, Nigel Harrison, Mark Mothersbaugh, Jamshied Sharifi, Jim Steinman and Nate Archibald. This album is on the list of the definitive 200 albums in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. An album, containing the film's soundtrack, was released in stores and was eventually nominated for a Grammy.But, in the end, they changed what shouldn't be touched much and left intact what, on the contrary, needed a deep revision. And the result is an anachronistic, unreal, absurd and embarrassing monstrosity. It's not an absolute cinematic disaster, as its director Craig Brewer pulls himself out of the swamp effectively, his direct homages to the original are good, and overall, it doesn't make your eyes bleed either. There were many ways to approach the challenge of remaking an '80s movie staple like ""Footloose,"" and this, of course, was the worst option. They were lucky that the original music by Kenny Loggins still has the same strength as then, which would be worth a check out just for the unparalleled pleasure of following again the rousing theme song and the dozens of dancing feet opening and closing the feature.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
How to take away every bit of greatness!,"This is so aweful, i don't even know where to begin. How can you take such a great original and destroy all of its glamorous glory. The director did not understand the basics of making a great feature. Let alone that the story to be transported to the now time does not hold up. A town that'd forbid dancing would've been well know in the time of internet.... And the dance scenes are so not romantic and sexistic that even the sympathy for the main characters is completely lost ... Dreadful... I couldn't bare finishing it.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
"Brewer Knows How To Blend Music and Film, So...","I had HIGH expectations. Hustle and Flow is one of my favorite movies from the past few years, and Black Snake Moan was an equally enjoyable affair (although not quite as awesome). I never saw the original Footloose, so I am judging this film and story solely based on this movie (as I feel most remakes should be, regardless). The music is pretty solid for the first half, but almost entirely disappears form the second half. Willard is the best character, and provides most of the film's laughs. The writing and acting are decent and the direction is capable, but overall this just doesn't feel like a movie that needed to be made.I will say, Brewer is the only person who could pull this off and make me watch the whole thing. His blues tunes in the early parts are amazing selections, and the choreography and geography are ideal for his type of film (music/""gritty"" visual color palette ). The last dance scene is pretty damn solid, too.The biggest drawbacks were the over-the-top cheesiness of it all and the excessive runtime. This story could've easily been told in 90 minutes. Also, it is absolutely unconstitutional and I understand it has happened before (as in Elmore City), but it is unlikely that, even in a Southern religious town, anywhere in 2011 would ban dancing. The internet kind of makes the plot moot.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
The Remake is a SAD excuse!,"Anybody who says the new Footloose is better than the original needs to watch the original again! The dancing didn't keep rhythm with the music till the last song! The acting was poor and the script writing that wasn't copied from the first was awful! The directing was shotty at best! They left out parts that needed to be and added parts that didn't need to be! The choreography was horrible! The music remakes were the worst ever with one exception, Joe Nichols version of Footloose was spot on and as good as the original! Remakes are the way to attract new crowds to the original and this one along with all other remakes I have seen fell drastically short! If I had never seen the first movie and I watched this one I would never even come close to watching the original! With all that said I give the movie a 3 out of 10!!!",3.0,Anonymous,Music
I wanted to really hate this but I couldn't.,"I have always tried to fill my reviews with honesty, so let's continue in this style. I am a big fan of the original Footloose Film! There I admitted it. It is a guilty pleasure of mine. A great uplifting film with a cool soundtrack.A few years ago I found out that a remake of this great film was announced. My first thought was ""really bad idea"". The film is a classic with one of the best theme songs of all time. This wasn't going to be a re-imagining of the film in the style of The Karate Kid (2010), but a remake of the original. These rarely end up as a good idea and never equal or better the original. How could the new version possibly live up to my expectations?Before I watched the remake I listened to the soundtrack, and by listen I mean played a few seconds of all the new versions of the classic songs, and by played I mean skipped to the next song in disgust at what I was hearing with every song. It was bad. This cemented my feelings that I was going to hate the new film. With trepidation and a lot of negative thoughts I sat down to watch my new most hated movie.The film follows the same story of the big city kid having to move in with family in a small town where religion plays a big part of everyday life. After the death of a group of teenagers killed in a road accident while travelling back from a night out drinking and dancing, the town led by the local preacher declares music and dance are bad and they ban them from public use anywhere in the town. The city kid clashes with the authority and attempts to change the towns views.The new version started off well with the classic Oscar nominated song playing over the opening credits. Once it ended I expected the film to go downhill fast. But I found myself enjoying it! Not just thinking it was OK but really enjoying the film. The characters were good, the story updated and changes from the original worked well. While listening to the soundtrack and hating the new versions of the songs, hearing them in the film they fit and make sense.The new actors in the film were for the most part as good the original cast. You have veteran actors Dennis Quaid as Rev. Shaw Moore and Andie MacDowell as his wife Vi Moore, they are just as good as John Lithgow and Dianne Wiest in the original. Taking over the lead roles from Kevin Bacon as Ren MacCormack and Lori Singer as Ariel Moore are new comers Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough. They are really good and make the roles their own. The film comes to life because of these actors. However the characters of Willard previously played by the late great Chris Penn now played by Miles Teller and Rusty originally Sarah Jessica Parker now Ziah Colon, don't live up to the original. This is not to say they aren't good in the film they are, but the original actors seemed to shine and stand out more. This made the characters a lot more memorable.The film adds a new introduction and shows us the back story of the accident. This is something the original was missing and it improves the story. There are also a few tributes to the 1984 version. The best is at the end when Ren and Ariel are wearing the same outfits as characters wear in the ending to the original and the same final dance routine is used.I wanted to really hate this but I couldn't. I liked it almost as much as the original. It really is a fun film that succeeds in modernising the story. I almost rated it 9/10, however right at the very end it went wrong. The final dance routine used a new version of the song Footloose. The song is a timeless classic and the new version just doesn't hit the mark. The film makers should have used the new version in the opening credits and stuck with the original for the films climax. For this reason I give the film 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Music
NOTHING WRONG WITH THE REMAKE,"So I saw this version first and I loved it I get it 80's probably the best era ever, but Kevin is like 30 in this movie playing a teenager I cant get over that . The uncle is more in 80's version is a price the music is better in the 80's version but isnt the song Footloose supposed to be the big song? So why did they play it atleast 3 times not to mention the 80's version had no black speaking roles if no blacks at all. It's a carbon copy which is what I'd expect a remake to be. Now Kevin Bacon was a better actor but then again he was 30 compared to an actual teenager. Obviously the dancing got better in remake. Point is both versions have their pros and cons so stop hating on the remake.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

There wasn't one iota of new ideas in this entire movie.I can only imagine the lack of effort it took to bring this thing together.The acting was fine, the production values were fine too, but when you know every scene before it comes because IT IS the same - you just don't care anymore.From the scraping of his license under his chin, to the yellow bug(yes the door still sticks), to his friend ""Willard"", to Ariel's dress in the final scene, to getting unfairly caught with a joint, to listening to quiet riot, to well, you get the point.I just don't SEE the point.

I forced my wife to sit through this at my request, and now I have a pile of payback that sits a mile high... thanks a lot Footloose!34/100 Probably worth about 45/100 until you factor in the fact it just blatantly copied an entire movie scene for scene, nuance for nuance, dialog for dialog...

Footloose 2011 brings back home the Bacon!,"A terrific remake on par with the original from 1984 with Kevin Bacon. TMG generally scorns remaking good films, but this one hits the mark. It helps greatly that newbie Kenny Wormald started dancing when he was only six years old. The story is exactly the same. So is most of the music. Dennis Quaid takes the role of the father-preacher held in the original by John Lithgow and does a decent job. So why does this film work so well again? The dancing is literally off the wall great. Visit ArtandJoyofMovies.com and listen to America's No.1 radio show on movies.The Footloose story is loosely based upon the history of Elmore City, Oklahoma, not the fictional city of Bomont, Midwest Somewhere. While Elmore had banned dancing for 100 years until high school kids changed things in 1980, both 1984 and 2011 versions are based upon a ban arising from a tragic car accident after a party five years earlier.

The thought that there could be people who liked this movie makes me scared for the population of America. First off, you can't ban dancing or music. A quick search of The American Constitution would have cleared that up for you. Secondly and just as importantly, just because a movie could be remade does not mean you have to. I understand how popular the first one was and there are some people out there who don't know what a book is who will give you their money. This doesn't mean you have to remake it.

A 5.9 IMDB RATING!? SERIOUSLY!?,"NOTE: I NEVER SAW THE ORIGINAL FILM.After seeing ""Footloose,"" I already thought of a headline for my IMDB review of the film. It goes like this: ""A FUN TIME + TOUCHING YET SIMPLE STORY AND MESSAGE + CHARACTERS YOU'LL LOVE = ""FOOTLOOSE""."" However, after seeing the IMDB user rating, I changed it to ""A 5.9 IMDB RATING!? SERIOUSLY!?"". I can't believe this movie has a 5.9. Yes, we have different tastes but a movie this good does not deserve a 5.9. Here's why:FUN TIME - It's an entertaining movie. The dances at the film's start, middle and end were very energetic.TOUCHING YET SIMPLE STORY & MESSAGE - The film tells the story of the dance-loving Ren who moves into a town that prohibits teens from public dancing after a tragic accident three years prior. The town basically sees dancing as a sin. Throughout the film, you can see teens wanting to dance (like what teens do). Basically saying: ""We won't be dancing when we're older, so please let us dance."" To avoid spoilers, I suggest whoever reads this review to check out the film. NOTHING MAJOR HAPPENS. HOWEVER, you'll feel the message at the film's 3rd act.CHARACTERS YOU'LL LOVE -Everyone has courage. The teens want to dance and you can see why. The parents don't want teens to violate the law (especially the law against dancing) and you can see why (though, they overreact a bit). You'll love them because you understand them.Now, the movie is not perfect.

If they had never come out with the original footloose and this was a random movie that was made and not a remake it would have been worth watching, but knowing how great the original Footloose was this movie was abysmal. Julianne Hough, did a good job, but doesn't compare to Lori Singer, the original Arial. It seemed as if she didn't put enough effort into the character she was playing, and when they gave her a line that was word for word from the original script she tried way too hard to make it right she butchered the original line.However, Kenny Wormald did an OK job as Ren MacCormick, but he could never out shine the original actor, Kevin Bacon. Yes he is a great dancer and yes he did a good acting the part, but when it came to having the charm and problems of Ren MacCormick he was no good at making it believable. The part that really made me wanna turn away from the movie was the scene when Ren is upset and lets out his anger in dance. they ruined the scene the original scene was much more heart racing and more wow then the one in the remake most definitely. That said, another thing that made me not like the remake is the way they killed the original songs, either use the same song or a different one don't have new singers remake the song and use it! One of my favorite songs in the movie is Hero originally sung by Bonnie Tyler. In this remake they decided to make it a slow song and that was a major mistake! However, Blake Shelton's remake of Kenny Loggins Footloose was amazing! The only character i cared for was Miles Teller who played Willard. He sounded and had the same sense of humor as Chris Penn who had played the original. I think he is the only one who had actually kept me entertained and brought me back to the original. Im not even gonna go into detail of Dennis Quaid's part of Shaw. Just gonna say awful! all in all this was an OK movie but i have to say, major disappointment!",,Anonymous,Music

Insanely boring,"This movie was insanely boring, and it upset me so much that I spent my time watching it that I decided to sit down and write a 600+ word review about it. It was such a boring, joyless movie, I can't imagine the 1984 original had any joy in it at all. In the opening scene, they kill the five teenagers in a car crash over the classic Kenny Loggins song ""Footloose,"" that he wrote for the original 1984 film. Apparently Kenny was annoyed that this film had the five high schoolers killed in the same scene that his happy & positive song was playing. I completely agree; I was annoyed that they killed the five teenagers when I was enjoying the classic song I like so much. Also, I was unaware that the plot centered around the deaths of these high schoolers, so I wasn't ready for such a killjoy either. Anyway, a lot of the movie is badly choreographed, a lot of the plot points do not make sense or are unrealistic, the acting is garbage...

Why remake a perfect movie .,"I refused to watch this remake of Footloose for 12 years. How could anyone replace Kevin Bacon, Chris Penn, John Lithgow, Diane West and Sarah Jessica Parker. Lori Singer didn't do much after footloose, but she was perfect for the part. The music for the original footloose, the dancing everything was perfection. I really don't know any of the actors or actresses except for Andy, McDowell and Dennis Quaid and I love both of their works. Just not in this movie.

Let's hear it . . .,"""Our Lord is testing us."" Rev. Shaw Moore (Dennis Quaid)Footloose, 27 years later, is alive and well. It may not have the heavy-duty cast of the original (Kevin Bacon, John Lithgow, and Chris Penn to name a few), but it is updated smartly with steamier sex, tighter jeans (""If you put a quarter in her back pocket you can tell whether it's heads or tails""), and more suggestive dancing.But the melodrama of a small Georgia town (originally the Midwest) is all there and the religious anchoring, too much so for my taste. The town banned dancing three years ago after a teen-age tragic car accident, and newcomer Ren (Kenny Wormald), from Boston is destined to change attitudes toward the expression of teen-age longing and passion by dancing out his feelings. Along with him are senior high-school buddies, more diverse than ever, who may be just a little too scrubbed but are still a helluva dance group.Most notable is buddy Willard played by the talented Miles Teller with an easy Southern redneck charm and surprising neophyte dancing.If you ask an unhip critic like me, there's not enough of this dancing and too much melodrama. Updating the action with country line dancing (""white man's wet dream"") and crumping got me to hoping for more rather than less of the energetic and sexy foot work. Alas, Andie MacDowell as preacher wife Vi Moore needs her face time to be heroic and hip when more break dancing could have done the job. Even Frank Capra seems in on it as Ren gives his righteous speech in front of the town council about the freedom to dance.Let's admit that Footloose is a formula film fulfilling its obligations with good cheer, some splendid dancing, and vividly colored costumes, characters, and sets to take an '80's treasure right into 2011.Although the VW bug remains, director Craig Brewer changes for the better the original tractor chicken standoff to a school bus free for all, and he lets a couple of 10 year olds go all out with the cutest version of Let's Hear It for the Boy you'll ever hear.Let's hear it for smart revisions.",,Anonymous,Music

But Kenny Wormald did a great job too... looked great and can DANCE! It must be hard to play such an iconic character that is associated with one particular actor.My one nark is that Julianne Hough is too old to play a high-schooler.So, don't get too emotional, looking at the past through rose-tinted glasses.

Angrier with less charm,"I like remakes. I do. It seems like a compliment to say hey this is a great story let's update it so more people can enjoy it. I like the original Footloose movie. I don't like this one at all. The original was more ""we went overboard on the rules after a tragedy and now kids can't even be kids"" and what happens after. This one is ""there was a tragedy but we are going to dance anyway but be mad that our parents won't let us grind on guys in front of them while our boyfriends sit in their truck drinking."" The story doesn't work because they aren't in trouble for just being kids. They get a mild scolding for grinding on guys in front of her dad while her boyfriend sits in his truck and drinks. You don't feel the pent up angst over small town rules. It feels more like they are spoiled brats who want to drink and drive, smoke pot and grind on guys in front of their parents. When the dad says ""your behavior has been atrocious"" even my rebel self has to agree. When Ren dances at work by himself it's more destructive than letting go and being himself. The balance between letting kids being kids and rules to keep them safe gets totally lost. The original had charm and a feeling of wanting to be able to let loose that anyone can relate to. This one doesn't feel like that at all. It's just angry kids mad that there are laws. It's weird.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Footloose,"A remake of the 1984 original starring Kevin Bacon.

The movie was so good I don't want to wait 2 1/2 months, for it to officially hit theaters, to see it again.

A Nutshell Review: Footloose,"No music no life, and for some, it's no dance no life. My memory of Footloose back in the 80s when I first saw it as a young boy, was Kevin Bacon, and the nifty dance moves that he did not perform. So do we need another remake to correct that, through the casting of a proper dancer in the lead role? In many ways this film by Craig Brewer is unnecessary, being nothing other than a platform to launch or further the acting careers of the multi-talented lead cast, and to satisfy his inner geek of coming up with his own vision of one of his favourite films, but in reality I'd rather stick to the Kevin Bacon version please, even if it meant having a stunt dance double twirl around the screen. It's almost as good as the original, almost, but lacking a little bit of its own soul since it's a superficial copy at best.There's no major change to the structure of the story, set in a small town where loud music and public dancing are banned, following a tragedy involving the accident and deaths of a few high school kids after a dance party fueled by alcohol, and the knee jerk reaction to this is to outright ban such activity, obtaining the stamp of approval by the town's pastor Rev. Shaw Moore (Dennis Quaid) to impose a tight rein on morals, enforced by the cop with an attitude Herb (Jayson Warner Smith). But as we know all too well, what you ban never really stays away, as all you do is to force it underground, which the young and the rebellious would take to like fish to water.As a teenage/young adult film, themes like challenging the status quo, or authoritative figures, is never quite far off, and usually it takes an outsider to come into a closed community to shake things up a little, and wake people up from their slumber of complacency. This change agent and catalyst comes in the form of Ren MacCormack (Kenny Wormald) who following the death of his mom and the unknown whereabouts of his dad, made the trek from Boston to his relatives in Bomont, looking very must the angst-filled young man coming with plenty of family and emotional baggage and looking for any outlet he can to release pent up frustration, from a souped up Beetle, to of course, loud music and dance. Being told he can't do any of it means a set up for a rage against the system.But before that comes the romantic aspects in the form of the village bicycle, so ironically the preacher's daughter herself Ariel Moore (Julianne Hough) who parties like there's no tomorrow, and with a token red neck, race car boyfriend Chuck Cranston (Patrick John Flueger) in tow who doesn't like that Ren can dance into the heart of his woman. So begins the love triangle, and the usual plotting about having a best friend (Miles Teller) who can't dance but can do so after a training montage.In essence you'll know just what to expect since the story's basically the same, about not judging a book by his cover, where the townsfolk slowly realize that Ren's pretty much the harmless guy despite his macho exterior. I mean, the guy dances, and dances well, and Kenny Wormald has the advantage of being a professionally trained dancer to pull this role off convincingly, though it would be a stretch if one considers this film to be his calling card ala what Saturday Night Fever did for John Travolta. Having Juliianne Hough play that romantic interest also seemed like a logical choice given her career thus far, and undoubtedly these two look great together whenever they heat up the dance floor, be it improvised numbers, or conforming to the steps of a line dance.Unfortunately that's about the best parts of the film, although the dances with their stylish choreography somewhat pales in comparison in just about any big budgeted Bollywood film item number. There are some nice attempts at enriching the plot, but these remains just attempts as a number of scenes just fly by for the sake of, such as the drug incident at the library and the aftermath with the school principal, or the very fleeting non-discussion between separation of church and state, which will work as timely reminders for the religious over-zealous folks around us, that it's almost always counter-productive if one gets pushy in wanting everyone to adopt one's moral compass. Unnecessary distraction in the form of Ren's car having its hood appear and disappear also inferred scenes got shifted around because of indecision.It's a good thing nobody had the insane idea of reworking the theme song for Footloose, but given the country version covered by Blake Sheldon, I'd still say, like the film, to give me the original please, with Kenny Loggins. Strictly meant for those who haven't seen the original or the fanbase of Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough, otherwise go dig up the original.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
I was really prepared to dislike this movie.,"I was really prepared to dislike this movie. After all, the original Footloose was an iconic movie and soundtrack of the eighties, and it certainly had a big influence on me. So it surprised me when I got to liking this one more and more as it played.Oh, there were things that rankled me a bit, but not enough to destroy my enjoyment of the flick. Why have the lead guy sport a Johnny Depp 80's haircut? Not to mention he and Ariel looked somewhat older than ""17"". And he was supposed to be this fantastic, expressive dancer but I didn't see a lot to impress me. Kevin Bacon had the swagger necessary to sell what he was doing. This guy was just cocky.I was put off by the conversion to so much country-style music, and the addition of rap-type tunes. Granted, they wanted to appeal to a larger audience but it just made for a haphazard soundtrack.It was puzzling in that it was definitely a remake, with much of the exact same dialogue and some shot-for-shot and line-for-line reproductions, and even readings, of the original, so why do it? I'm a bit amazed that they even got an ""ethnic"" lookalike for Rusty, the Sarah Jessica Parker character. Dennis Quaid pouts through the entire film, except for one moment where he does flash his trademark grin.Some of the things I liked: The uncle character was the total opposite of the original, which was a nice surprise in that he actually supported Ren instead of opposing him like most of the other adults. I initially didn't like the guy who played Willard but by the end I thought he was the best character in the whole movie.So, why did I like it so much? I don't know, but I did!",8.0,Anonymous,Music

A Remake Worth Seeing,"I was completely surprised by this film. Director Craig Brewer (who also worked on the rewrite) has made an enjoyable film in the spirit of the original Footloose, with its energy and fun, and possibly even surpassed it in heart.In the remake, the characters seem more developed and real. I did not know how anyone could live up to the iconic Kevin Bacon Ren, but the writing (particularly the changes to the back-story) combined with his talent and likability make Kenny Wormald great in this role.Setting it in the South added another dimension to the film. As an urban Southerner, I found it familiar and the jokes hysterical, but if you loathe anything country and Southern, be warned that this has its fair share of that vibe.The original film has quite a bit of sex, drugs, drinking and violence, and I was curious as to how they would be handled in a remake, especially one that seemed a little more intense from the trailer. Overall, I thought the portrayals of ""risky behavior"" sent a better message than the original without coming off as hokey in the least.It will be obvious to film goers that Brewer loves Footloose and wanted to do it justice in this remake. He pays tribute and yet develops the film as well. If you give it a chance, I think you will be pleasantly surprised as well.",,Anonymous,Music

An entertaining film,"This modern remake of a cultish classic is at least as palatable as the original. The updates work well for this kind of film, which is, admittedly, a semi-musical. So I was pleasantly surprised that it was worth the price of admission, with some change back to boot.To make it enjoyable the film at least had to do the music and dancing well, which it did. The two young stars, Julianne Hough as Ariel Moore (a preacher's daughter) and an unknown for me; Kenny Wormald as Ren MacCormack, did deliver on the dance floor. Both of them are superb dancers and Hough, especially, looked great in the saloon, line dancing scene. I think part of the reason she's amazing to watch is because she looks like she's having the time of her life.But music and dancing can't be the whole movie, we hope, so there has to be dabs of acting to weld the disparate pieces together. The sparks to accomplish the welds are some fine moments by all the supporting actors. It leads off with Dennis Quaid, playing Hough's ministerial father. He's turned into an excellent actor over the years and is believable in the role. There is also Ray McKinnon as Wormald's uncle. He's an asset to the film, one of the best actors on screen that night. Miles Teller as Willard, Wormald's side-kick was surprisingly good, an engaging personality that gave some comedic relief to the rest of the proceedings. The rest of the supporting cast were assets as well; Andie MacDowell as Hough's mother. Then there was Patrick John Flueger as Chuck Cranston, the resident bad guy along with the town meanie played by Brett Rice as Roger Dunbar. Also, worth note was Ziah Colon as Rusty; Hough's friend.But the real acting surprise, and treat, was Ms. Hough. She was not only believable in just the right degree at the serious, crucial, points but solid throughout. The character she played called for a fair range of emotions and it was a genuine pleasure to watch her deliver every time. Even in the films early scenes, she looked radiant sans makeup. I appreciated the addition of those glimpses of her natural state, because as a trained artist I saw them as a great study in the structure of a classic beauty. I think she's the rare girl who looks just as beautiful without the makeup. And on top of that she can act. In this instance, she clearly outshines the female lead in the original. Hough's stunning looks are soon overshadowed in the film by the sheer talent she so effortlessly gives the audience.By Bruce L. Jones http://webpages.charter.net/bruce.jones1/",,Anonymous,Music

A decent time-passer that should appeal to its target demographic,"I haven't seen the '84 original starring Kevin Bacon, so I didn't go into this with those kind of expectations. The plot is a fairly simple teens vs. adults story, so I also wasn't expecting anything terribly deep. And, now having finished it I would say that my limited expectations of at least being entertained were met. Beyond that, FOOTLOOSE is a very clichéd teen drama that just happens to have good music and dancing sequences. The gist of the story is that a city kid, Ren McCormack (Kenny Wormald) moves in with relatives who live in the sleepy southern town of Bomont, Georgia. Three years ago, after a tragic accident took the lives of five teenagers, the town council enacted a series of ordinances that aimed to prevent what caused it. Among those was an ordinance banning public dancing for those under 18 years of age.To me, such a set up is flimsy at best but the film worked with it in a decent, if pedestrian, way. On the surface is functions as story in which the rebellious teens face off against the stubborn, over-protective adults. But, towards the end, they manage to shoehorn a message about parents learning to trust their children. Nice, but a little too late if you ask me. The most interesting aspect of the film to me was the way in which it pits small-town life and values against real-world logic. I don't feel like the film ever disrespected people who live like that, but it wasn't exactly friendly towards them either. More problematic to me was a minister (Dennis Quaid) who wants to protect his daughter (Julianne Hough) against an abusive guy, yet slaps her across the face when she starts mouthing him off. That one scene came as an unwelcome surprise to me, and something which seemed completely out of character.In terms of acting, nobody was particularly bad. Dennis Quaid and Andie MacDowell came off looking the best, but I wouldn't place what they did here among their best work. As for Julianne Hough, let's just say she shouldn't abandon her singing and dancing careers. Kenny Wormald did fine as Ren McCormack but, like every other actor playing a teenager in this film, was utterly unconvincing as such. In terms of filmmaking quality, the cinematography and choreography was fine but unspectacular. Overall, it was a decent time-passer that was fitfully entertaining. It was a little too predictable for my tastes, and also not targeted to me, but that shouldn't stop teenagers enjoying it for the frivolous piece of entertainment that it is.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

The cast is awful and the directing is just as bad!! The location they picked is also not fitting for footloose!!Just stick with the original and you will be just fine!! Let Hollywood keep trying to figure out why this remake is so pathetic and completely unnecessary! Let's hope they pull it from everything!",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Footloose: A So-So Remake,"Of course, when you talk about remakes, you instantly make comparisons to the original. The original 1984 film ""Footloose"" had a ridiculous plot and cheesy acting, but with some neat choreography and classic music, that contributed to its charm. Was a remake of ""Footloose"" necessary? I don't think so. I approached this one expecting the worst. Fortunately, the movie wasn't awful. In fact, at moments, it's quite good.Boston resident Ren McCormack moves to the small town of Bomont, where everything to the adults is religion and dancing isn't allowed. After a tragedy that occurred ten years ago, the town decided that any dancing or teenage activity is just wrong. Many teenagers are still breaking the rules, including Reverend Shaw Moore's daughter Ariel. Soon enough, Ren leads the pack in fighting to abolish the no-dancing law.This remake is almost a scene-for-scene, line-for-line adaptation (the original film's writer Dean Pitchford co-wrote the script), so that certainly sets the film slightly on the wrong track.But it should really come down to how the actors portray their characters, and there are some highlights of disappointment. Newcomer Kenny Wormald as Ren has his benefits, being a professional dancer. He sports some good choreography, especially in what I like to call ""the angry dance"" scene. However, some elements of believability are missing. At times, I didn't believe Ren's rebellious nature, unlike with Kevin Bacon's portrayal in 1984. Wormald seems afraid of his actions, which probably won't sit well with fans of the original. As for Ariel, Julianne Hough falls into Wormald's category. She is also a professional dancer, and her solo work during the film is energetic and entertaining. Her acting chops are decent, surprisingly. But the fact that she is almost 30 years old hurts her performance and makes us think her age doesn't fit the role. Dennis Quaid is still hamming it up in his movies, but actually holds back here as Ariel's father. There are some nice moments of father-daughter confrontation and Quaid's care for his family is a nice icing on the cake. Andie MacDowell's screen time as Vi Moore, Shaw's wife, is minimal. She almost disappears into the set.The best actor here is Miles Teller as Ren's buddy Willard. Teller is funny and likable, and the sequence where he finally learns to dance is nifty and enjoyable.And then there's the soundtrack, one of the film's biggest challenges. The original's music is a stand-out and still has people dancing to it. Over four songs from the original have been covered, and since director Craig Brewer (known for ""Black Snake Moan"" and ""Hustle and Flow"") has Southern roots in him, the soundtrack has a lot of country twang to it, but settles for a few hip-hop moments. One cover of ""Holding Out For A Hero"" is quirky and interesting. Blake Shelton's shot at the Kenny Loggins title classic is not bad. But then there are moments when the music falls flat. Jana Kramer's rendition of ""Let's Hear It For The Boy"" is missing the stylish 80's funk of the original. And last, we have the classic love theme ""Almost Paradise,"" originally performed by Mike Reno and Ann Wilson. Victoria Justice and Hunter Hayes try their hand at this emotional classic, and the emotion feels stripped away. What was once a wonderful and vibrant ballad has turned into a Disney track.Overall, the movie does have its strong points. The choreography is fantastic, and the acting sure isn't terrible. But the story of ""Footloose"" is dated by now and remains a fine display of an 80's guilty pleasure. This is just a carbon copy of the original that lacks some of its pizazz. The 1984 movie was cheesy to a hilt, and we love it for that. So why does the remake sometimes take itself too seriously? Pre-teens might find this one a blast. Die-hard fans of the original will be split right down the middle. But since I am a fan, Craig Brewer's ""Footloose"" could have been much worse.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Awesome,"I find that this remake of the movie is amazing. It brings the old and meets up with the new age of everything. I've seen this movie many times and even went out and bought it. I would definitely refer it to anyone and everyone. Very Very good.Plus the people they chose to star in the movie, did an phenomenal job. They couldn't have picked anyone better to play the roles in the movie. It was a great family movie to sit around and enjoy. I plan on watching this movie many many many more times. 10/10 FOR SURE! MUST WATCH! If you haven't watched, your definitely missing out. The dance scenes are well thought out and let me tell you, they do get stuck in my head! whoop!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Wonderfully entertaining!!,"I admit it, I have not seen the original. Bits and scenes, but not all of it. I really like Kenny in Center Stage: Turn it Up, so when a friend asked me to a sneak preview of Footloose I said 'sure!' Wow! I can't tell you how much I LOVE this movie. The dancing is fabulous and the acting is so much better than I had hoped for from dancers (when I see a dance movie, though, I don't care as much if the acting is sub-par as long as the choreography and dancers are great). I wasn't expecting much going into the theater, I don't know much about the story other than there would be dancing. Let me tell you, I wasn't just pleasantly surprised by this movie - I was blown away by the comedy, the choreography and the lovable characters. The music is a great mix of styles and genres (I'll be looking up the soundtrack for purchase, too). If you like dancing, rebel children or sweet love stories this movie should make you smile. I highly recommend it, and go ahead and see it in the theater - the music and dancing are great on a big screen!",,Anonymous,Music
Kenny was great as Ren but...,Lost points because of Julianne's Hough bad acting and the lack of chemistry with Kenny Wormald. I really loved all the car scenes. Some of them are better than the originals ones.,8.0,Anonymous,Music
Not that bad,"I've seen both movies, first the original and then the remake. I don't get why the remake recieved so much negativity? I know nothing competes with the original, but I liked the remake better because it was more lively and there were no drastic changes, actually it seemed way better and not so boring like the first movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Footloose 2011 same story fresh look!,"Footloose was great. I was not expecting much, just another remake of a classic 80's hit. I was pleasantly surprised,the story-line was changed to make it more current. But all the great scenes we loved in 1984 Footloose are recreated as homages to the original. It was face paced and fun. The audience was made up of several different ages groups and all of had a great time. Julianne Hough was lovely, her performance was sweet and sexy.Her performance as Ariel was touching and real. Kenny Wormald had just the right amount of bad attitude. I loved Miles Teller's performance as Willard, He played the role better than Chris Penn in the original.",,Anonymous,Music
Quite Good.,"I thought this film was very enjoyable almost as good as the original, but i wish they put more dance into it, and then it would of been absolutely awesome. This film has a feel good tone to it, i came out of the cinema smiling and dancing with my cousin. The music in this film is absolutely awesome just like the original. The acting in this film could be improved, i thought Kenny, Julianne and Dennis were awesome but some of the back characters were really cheesy, offensive or boring. The three children in the back ground are absolutely hilarious and add so much to the story line. This film is definitely Craig Brewer's best yet.I think this film definitely deserves a higher rank then 5.1 so i would give it a 7.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"OK so not a review, just wanted to point some things out to the person who reviewed above me!","obviously i can't post a review about a movie i haven't seen yet, but i wanted to just let pturner1010 know that Julianne's last name - spelled Hough - is pronounced ""Huff"". And Julianne actually IS a professional dancer (and singer too, i'm listening to her CD as i type this). I'm assuming you haven't seen ""Dancing with the Stars"", but she was one of the professionals on that show before she left the show about 2 seasons ago to work on this movie. I think she also did ""Burlesque"", but i might be wrong about that....i personally can't WAIT to see this movie. I was a fan of the original ""Footloose"", and i am a fan of Julianne Hough's work as well!!",,Anonymous,Music
Fantastic film!,"If you watch this film you will not be disappointed! Perfect movie for any event and fun for the whole family! Old version was so-so, new version gave me life! Made me feel like my life was worth living. 10/10 would recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
a so-so movie with a great soundtrack,"I must admit that I was a tad bit skeptical as I walked into the theater to see the Footloose remake. I'm a fan of the 1984 original, in which Kevin Bacon starred, and I couldn't help but wonder to myself how could the new version would stand up against the old. Upon my viewing, the answer was simple; there was no comparison.Having seen the original a countless number of times, it became quite obvious early on that the storyline was going to follow directly with the previous film. The new version even went so far as to duplicate some of the lines from the original. There was some modernization to coincide with the different eras in which the films take place; such as the kids having iPods and listening to rap, and some of the dancing was reminiscent of what could be seen in the dance film Step Up.Julianne Hough, best known for her appearances on the ABC hit reality show Dancing with the Stars, does a good job in her first leading role, as Ariel Moore. Hough's portrayal of the rebellious Ariel is a quite enjoyable. Kenny Wormald, making his acting debut, plays Ren McCormack, the new guy in town. Considering the iconic shoes of Kevin Bacon, of which Wormald has been tasked with filling, I'd say he did a serviceable job. It's difficult not to compare the performances to those that came before, so in order to give Wormald his just deserts I'd like to see him act in something using an original script and not something redone. Dennis Quaid as Reverend Shaw Moore and Andi MacDowell as Vi Moore, both do a fantastic job as Ariel's parents. Their performances were on par with the acting done by John Lithgow and Diane West, who played the same roles in the original. The one bright spot in the remade film was Miles Teller, who played Ren's best friend Willard. Teller gave one of my favorite performances in the film. Teller's Ren added a humor which made the film much more enjoyable. Teller's performance out shined the job done by his 1984 counterpart, the late Christopher Penn.Having seen a screening of the film, I'm not sure I would pay full theater price to see this; If you are on the fence about going, I say skip it. It's a movie that won't lose much in a transfer from the big screen to the small screen; therefore, wait for it to come out on DVD and get it from NetFlix or Redbox. The Soundtrack however, is definitely worth checking out. The music from the movie included some of the songs from the original film; however each song has been modernized. I really liked how the songs were different, but not to the point that you weren't able to recognize them. Save your ticket money and buy the music instead.Rating: Cvisit our site at www.twodudereview.com",,Anonymous,Music
Dancing in the Aisles,"I was fortunate to win a ticket to a screening in Westwood at the Village Theater and that theater was rocking! People were singing and dancing in the aisles. It was contagious! The story was certainly good enough to carry the movie, but the music and dancing just rage and whoever has any drawbacks on this film just doesn't know how to have a great time. This is the reason movies are made - for people to express every emotion - and this one captures youth, joy, music, fun, and of course - DANCING!!! Shake yourself up and get on down to see this, you will find your feet moving and your body swaying to the rhythm! It was more than cool, and the cast was great, each person fit the part so well. It isn't a heavy piece, but it never intended to be, it is a fun movie for all to enjoy, and again, if you can't enjoy this one, have your blood pressure checked to see of you're still living!",,Anonymous,Music
Can't Touch the Original But It's Good,"Footloose (2011)*** (out of 4)Remake of the 1984 cult classic about a small town who pretty much shuts down all alcohol, loud music and dancing after five seniors are killed in a car crash after a party. Soon a guy from Boston (Kenny Wormald) coming to town and wanting to see things changed. He ends up involved with a troubled young girl (Julianne Hough) who just happens to be the daughter of the preacher (Dennis Quaid) keeping everything under control. There's not a single frame in this remake that comes close to the appeal of the first movie but based on its own merits, this here really isn't too bad and it's entertaining enough to make it worth sitting through once but if you're unfamiliar with the Kevin Bacon version then that's definitely the one to start with. There were a few problems with this version including the fact that the film really drags at 112-minutes. The movie feels quite long at times and especially the final thirty-minutes when things turn a bit too slow. Also, you have to take into consideration that this is pretty far from original as it's basically just a straight remake, although this one here updates some of the music. Still, for the most part I found the story to be entertaining and the characters, while not as good as in the original, fun enough to make this worth sitting through. I thought Wormald did a pretty good job in the lead, although that annoying Boston accent seemed to come and go in ever scene. Hough made for a good good girl trying to be bad. Quaid was fun in his supporting role and we even get Andie McDowell playing his wife. The rest of the teens fit their roles nicely. The music here is another plus as it sticks to some old stuff as well as mixing in the new while also sampling from many genres. This remake of FOOTLOOSE certainly wasn't needed and as I said it doesn't improve on a single thing but it's still an entertaining movie.",,Anonymous,Music
"Entertaining, but not necessarily exciting","""Footloose"" is a pleasant-enough movie as it is, but I think it could have used tougher material and characters with more depth. We don't get nearly enough scenes involving the priest. Even if he is an obvious character, he still could, would and should have given the movie some juice. Ren, the character previously played by Kevin Bacon, isn't as troubled as you'd expect him to be, or as he should have been. With the title ""Footloose"", I expected something more. And I also wanted more dancing, too. The only dancing that's offered here comes during the opening titles, the last scene of the movie, and somewhere after dancing has been outlawed. If this is supposed to be a ""musical"", then the movie really falls short. I was moderately entertained, but not necessarily surprised. On another note, doesn't Ren's girlfriend remind you of Ellen Pompeo? And a little of Jennifer Aniston? **1/2 out of ****",,Anonymous,Music
Sinner Man  (Nina Simone),"Stevie Wonder (Songs in the Key of Life, 1976) remained the Music Maestro even after the King of Pop coronation (Thriller, 1983).I was 27 when the one-and-only-Kevin-Bacon danced his way into the hearts of the then-still-corny-by-proxy-pop-music-not-rap-not-as-good-as Michael Jackson's 1983 Moonwalk. Just as Michael Jackson was the Moonwalk, Kevin Bacon was Footloose - two different pleasures enjoyed at different times in our lives because music and dancing became the best of friends and the best of lovers.Stevie Wonder is The First Love. Same goes for Jennifer Holliday (And I'm Telling You), Minnie Ripperton (1981) and Mr. Robert Nesta Marley (1981).... First Love and First Dance. Michael Jackson is the First Dance. Sade reminded us ""Its Never As Good as the First Time"" taking me back to Stevie Wonder and the First Love and if one is very lucky another First Dance.Footloose (1984) is the Last Dance before the party ends.There is no point to the party of Footloose (2011), there is no sinner, man.",,Anonymous,Music
