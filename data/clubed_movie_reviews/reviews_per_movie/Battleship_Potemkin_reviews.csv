"This is a cinematic masterpiece, way ahead of its time.","There are only a handful of movies that were made on such a grand scale and made such a difference in the art of movie making.""Bronenosets Potyomkin"" is one of these movies, and it should be on anyone's list looking to learn more about the history of cinema.Grigori Aleksandrov & Sergei M. Eisenstein directed this groundbreaking film that documents the horrors taking place on a Russian battleship. When the sailors finally retaliate against their superiors, the locals embrace the them, and support them. Things get ugly when a group of soldiers are sent to the small town to take care of business.  What follows is one of the most imitated scenes in the history of cinema. Anyone who has seen ""The Untouchables"", and ""Bronenosets Potyomkin"" knows exactly what I mean.Overall I think this movie raised the bar for film making just as ""Intolerance"" did a few years earlier. If you do not mind silent films, do yourself a favor, and see ""Bronenosets Potyomkin"".If you don't like silent films..... watch ""Bronenosets Potyomkin"" anyway.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"""The time has come for us to speak out.""","On June 14 1905, during the Russian Revolution of that year, sailors aboard the Russian battleship Potemkin rebelled against their oppressive officers. Frustrated with the second-rate treatment they receive, and most particularly the maggot-infested meat that they are forced to eat, the ship's crew, led by the inspirational Bolshevik sailor Grigory Vakulinchuk (Aleksandr Antonov), decide that the time is ripe for a revolution. And so begins Sergei M. Eisenstein's rousing classic of Russian propaganda, 'Bronenosets Potyomkin / The Battleship Potemkin.'The film itself is brimming with shining examples of stunning visual imagery: the spectacles of an overthrown ship captain dangle delicately from the side rope over which he had been tossed; the body of a deceased mutineer lies peaceful upon the shore, the sign on his chest reading ""KILLED FOR A BOWL OF SOUP;"" close-up shots of the clenching fists of the hundreds of spectators who are finally fed up with the Tsarist regime; a wayward baby carriage careers down the Odessa Steps as desperate onlookers watch on with bated breath (this scene was memorably ""borrowed"" by Brian De Palma for a particularly suspenseful scene in his 'The Untouchables'); the barrels of numerous canons are ominously leveled towards the vastly-outnumbered battleship Potemkin.However, the film itself is best analysed  not as a fragmented selection of memorable scenes  but as a single film, and, indeed, every scene is hugely memorable. Though divided into five fairly-distinct chapters, the entire film flows forwards wonderfully; at no point do we find ourselves losing interest, and we are absolutely never in doubt of whose side we should be sympathetic towards.The film is often referred to as ""propaganda,"" and that is exactly what it is, but this need not carry a negative connotation. 'The Battleship Potemkin' was produced by Eisenstein with a specific purpose in mind, and it accomplishes this perfectly in every way. Planned by the Soviet Central Committee to coincide with the 20th century celebrations of the unsuccessful 1905 Revolution, 'Potemkin' was predicted to be a popular film in its home country, symbolising the revitalization of Russian arts after the Revolution. It is somewhat unfortunate, then, that Eisenstein's film failed to perform well at the Russian box-office, reportedly beaten by Allan Dwan's 1922 'Robin Hood' film in its opening week and running for just four short weeks. Luckily, despite being banned on various occasions in various countries, 'The Battleship Potemkin' fared more admirably overseas.The film also proved a successful vehicle for Eisenstein to test his theories of ""montage."" Through quick-cut editing, and distant shots of the multitudes of extras, the audience is not allowed to sympathise with any individual characters, but with the revolutionary population in general. Eisenstein does briefly break this mould, however, in a scene where Vakulinchuk flees the ship officer who is trying to kill him, and, of course, during the renowned Odessa Steps sequence, as our hearts beat in horror for the life of the unfortunate child in the tumbling baby carriage. The accompanying soundtrack to the version I watched, largely featuring the orchestral works of Dmitri Shostakovich, served wonderfully to heighten the emotional impact of such scenes.One of the greatest films of the silent era, 'The Battleship Potemkin' is a triumph of phenomenal film-making, and is a significant slice of cinematic history. The highly-exaggerated events of the film (among other things, there was never actually any violent massacre on the Odessa Steps) have so completely engrained themselves in the memory, that we're often uncertain of the true history behind the depicted events. This is a grand achievement.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A gripping story told with style and passion as well as a 'must see' piece of cinema history,"With workers striking in Russia, the crew of the battleship Potemkin feel a certain kinship for the plight of their brothers. When they are served rotting, maggot infested meat some of the crew object, only to find themselves singled out and placed in front of a firing squad. With the marines seconds away from firing the deadly shots, ordinary seaman Grigory Vakulinchuk steps into the breach and intervenes to save the men by appealing to the firing squad to ignore their orders. When the officers take their revenge and kill Vakulinchuk, all are bonded together in the struggle; a bond that reaches to the city of Odessa where the rebellion grows, leading to a bloody and historic series of events.It is hard to imagine that anybody who has seen quite a few films in the past few decades would be unaware of this film, but it is perhaps understandable that fewer have had the opportunity to actually sit down and watch. I had never seen this film before but had seen countless references to it in other films and therefore considering it an important film to at least see once. The story is based on real events and this only serves to make it more interesting but even without this context it is still an engaging story. The story doesn't have much in the way of characters but it still brings out the brutality and injustice of events and it is in this that it hooked me  surprisingly violent (implied more than modern gore) it demonising the actions and shows innocents falling at all sides in key scenes. The version I saw apparently had the original score (I'm not being snobby  modern rescores could be better for all I know) and I felt it worked very well to match and improve the film's mood; dramatic, gentle or exciting, it all works very well.The feel of the film was a surprise to me because it stood up very well viewed with my modern eyes. At one or two points the model work was very clearly model work but mostly the film is technically impressive. The masses of extras, use of ships and cities and just the way it captures such well organised chaos are all very impressive and would be even done today. What is more impressive with time though is how the film has a very strong and very clean style to it  it is not as gritty and flat as many silent films of the period that I have seen; instead it is very crisp and feels very, very professional. Of course watching it in 2004 gives me the benefit of hindsight where I can look back over many films that have referenced the images or directors who have mentioned the film in interviews; but even without this 20:20 vision it is still possible to see how well done the film is and to note how memorable much of it is  the steps and the firing squad scenes are two very impressive moments that are very memorable. The only real thing that might bug modern audiences is the acting; it isn't bad but silent acting is very different from acting with sound. Here the actors all over act and rely on their bodies to do much of their delivery  word cards just don't do the emotional job so they have to make extra effort to deliver this.Overall this is a classic film that has influenced many modern directors. The story is engaging and well worth hearing; the directing is crisp and professional, producing many scenes that linger in the memory; the music works to deliver the emotional edge that modern audiences would normally rely on acting and dialogue to deliver and the whole film is over all too quickly! An essential piece of cinema for those that claim to love the media but also a cracking good film in its own right.",,Anonymous,History
"Like Citizen Kane it's almost been TOO analyzed and cherished as a landmark, but still not without good reason","If you're a film student, or were one, or are thinking of becoming one, the name Battleship Potemkin has or will have a resonance. Sergei Eistenstein, like other silent-film pioneers like Griffith (although Eisenstein's innovations are not as commonplace as Griffith's) and Murnau, has had such an impact on the history of cinema it's of course taken for granted. The reason I bring up the film student part is because at some point, whether you'd like it or not, your film professor 9 times out of 10 will show the ""Odessa Stairs"" sequence of this film. It's hard to say if it's even the 'best' part of the film's several sequences dealing with the (at the time current) times of the Russian revolution. But it does leave the most impact, and it can be seen in many films showcasing suspense, or just plain montage (The Untouchables' climax comes to mind).Montage, which was not just Eistenstein's knack but also his life's blood early in his career, is often misused in the present cinema, or if not misused then in an improper context for the story. Sometimes montage is used now as just another device to get from point A to point B. Montage was something else for Eisenstein; he was trying to communicate in the most direct way that he could the urgency, the passion(s), and the ultimate tragedies that were in the Russian people at the time and place. Even if one doesn't see all of Eisenstein's narrative or traditional 'story' ideas to have much grounding (Kubrick has said this), one can't deny the power of seeing the ships arriving at the harbor, the people on the stairs, and the soldiers coming at them every which way with guns. Some may find it hard to believe this was done in the 20's; it has that power like the Passion of Joan of Arc to over-pass its time and remain in importance if only in terms of technique and emotion.Of course, one could go on for books (which have been written hundreds of times over, not the least of which by Eisenstein himself). On the film in and of itself, Battleship Potemkin is really more like a dramatized newsreel than a specific story in a movie. The first segment is also one of the great sequences in film, as a mutiny is plotted against the Captain and other head-ups of a certain Ship. This is detailed almost in a manipulative way, but somehow extremely effective; montage is used here as well, but in spurts of energy that capture the eye. Other times Eisenstein is more content to just let the images speak for themselves, as the soldiers grow weary without food and water. He isn't one of those directors who will try to get all sides to the story; he is, of course, very much early 20th century Russian, but he is nothing else but honest with how he sees his themes and style, and that is what wins over in the end.Some may want to check it outside of film-school, as the 'Stairs' sequence is like one of those landmarks of severe tragedy on film, displaying the ugly side of revolution. Eisenstein may not be one of the more 'accessible' silent-film directors, but if montage, detail in the frame, non-actors, and Bolshevik themes are your cup of tea, it's truly one of the must sees of a lifetime.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent piece of cinema-history,"There is something special about watching the really old films, especially when it is a film as influential as 'Bronenosets Potyomkin' ('The Battleship Potemkin'). Besides the historical value of the film I was surprised how much I really enjoyed it. Director Sergei Eisenstein takes reel events and changes them a little for this powerful film.The story begins on the battleship Potemkin where the men are served rotten meat. A sailor named Vakulinchuk (Aleksandr Antonov) steps up and after a series of events mutiny is what follows. Out of revenge an officer is able to kill Vakulinchuk. The men on the ship want to honor him and try to bring their revolution to the shore, to the city of Odessa. They place him in the harbor in a tent with a sign that says he was killed over a boil of soup. The people of Odessa sympathize with the sailors from the Potemkin and they are welcomed in their city. A massacre, in one of the most famous sequences of the cinema, is what follows on the Odessa Staircase.It is especially this great sequence that shows some real horrors, uncompromising I should add. There are images, like the slit eyeball from 'Un Chien Andalou', you will remember. The people on the staircase, troops firing at them, a crushed hand, a woman with her child shot dead, but most of all a carriage with a baby in it, rolling down the staircase. Every image is effective, showing things what few (or no) films did back then. I was amazed of how good this scene still works today; I was watching in disbelieve.On a technical scale the film is also very good. Most of the time we believe we are watching what the film wants us to see, the visuals work. Eisenstein is able to make things even more effective the way he cuts between the images. Famous for its montage, 'Bronenosets Potyomkin' sometimes seems like a choreographed sequence of presented images, with a rhythm and a tempo. I could say so much more about this film, one you should have seen if you are interested in the history of the cinema. If you do not really care you might give it a chance. It is one of the most effective silent films I can think of, still very accessible for a large audience.",10.0,Anonymous,History
One of the greatest movies ever made.,"Originally supposed to be just a part of a huge epic The Year 1905 depicting the Revolution of 1905, Potemkin is the story of the mutiny of the crew of the Potemkin in Odessa harbor. The film opens with the crew protesting maggoty meat and the captain ordering the execution of the dissidents. An uprising takes place during which the revolutionary leader is killed. This crewman is taken to the shore to lie in state. When the townspeople gather on a huge flight of steps overlooking the harbor, czarist troops appear and march down the steps breaking up the crowd. A naval squadron is sent to retake the Potemkin but at the moment when the ships come into range, their crews allow the mutineers to pass through. Eisenstein's non-historically accurate ending is open-ended thus indicating that this was the seed of the later Bolshevik revolution that would bloom in Russia. The film is broken into five parts: Men and Maggots, Drama on the Quarterdeck, An Appeal from the Dead, The Odessa Steps, and Meeting the Squadron.Eisenstein was a revolutionary artist, but at the genius level. Not wanting to make a historical drama, Eisenstein used visual texture to give the film a newsreel-look so that the viewer feels he is eavesdropping on a thrilling and politically revolutionary story. This technique is used by Pontecorvo's The Battle of Algiers.Unlike Pontecorvo, Eisenstein relied on typage, or the casting of non-professionals who had striking physical appearances. The extraordinary faces of the cast are what one remembers from Potemkin. This technique is later used by Frank Capra in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town and Meet John Doe. But in Potemkin, no one individual is cast as a hero or heroine. The story is told through a series of scenes that are combined in a special effect known as montage--the editing and selection of short segments to produce a desired effect on the viewer. D.W. Griffith also used the montage, but no one mastered it so well as Eisenstein.The artistic filming of the crew sleeping in their hammocks is complemented by the graceful swinging of tables suspended from chains in the galley. In contrast the confrontation between the crew and their officers is charged with electricity and the clenched fists of the masses demonstrate their rage with injustice.Eisenstein introduced the technique of showing an action and repeating it again but from a slightly different angle to demonstrate intensity. The breaking of a plate bearing the words ""Give Us This Day Our Daily Bread"" signifies the beginning of the end. This technique is used in Last Year at Marienbad. Also, when the ship's surgeon is tossed over the side, his pince-nez dangles from the rigging. It was these glasses that the officer used to inspect and pass the maggot-infested meat. This sequence ties the punishment to the corruption of the czarist-era.The most noted sequence in the film, and perhaps in all of film history, is The Odessa Steps. The broad expanse of the steps are filled with hundreds of extras. Rapid and dramatic violence is always suggested and not explicit yet the visual images of the deaths of a few will last in the minds of the viewer forever.The angular shots of marching boots and legs descending the steps are cleverly accentuated with long menacing shadows from a sun at the top of the steps. The pace of the sequence is deliberately varied between the marching soldiers and a few civilians who summon up courage to beg them to stop. A close up of a woman's face frozen in horror after being struck by a soldier's sword is the direct antecedent of the bank teller in Bonnie in Clyde and gives a lasting impression of the horror of the czarist regime.The death of a young mother leads to a baby carriage careening down the steps in a sequence that has been copied by Hitchcock in Foreign Correspondent, by Terry Gilliam in Brazil, and Brian DePalma in The Untouchables. This sequence is shown repeatedly from various angles thus drawing out what probably was only a five second event.Potemkin is a film that immortalizes the revolutionary spirit, celebrates it for those already committed, and propagandizes it for the unconverted. It seethes of fire and roars with the senseless injustices of the decadent czarist regime. Its greatest impact has been on film students who have borrowed and only slightly improved on techniques invented in Russia several generations ago.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Still one of the best films ever made.,"Quite a lot has been said about this film and its landmark importance in forming the language of film.  If you are interested in film history, to truly understand the innovations Eisenstein brings to the medium you might try viewing Potemkin along side most any film made before it (those of D.W. Griffith offer a good contrast).  It should be allowed that Eisenstein was not the only montage theorist and the principles of montage editing would likely have been discovered by another given time.  However, even today, few directors have approached the skill with which Eisenstein created meaning through the combination of images at such an early point in the evolution of the medium.If you are not interested in that sort of thing, Potemkin is still one of the most beautiful and moving films ever made.  You should see it, buy it, and tatoo it to your chest.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Red Army,"An epic of the Russian revolution, Battleship Potemkin, perhaps not so correctly historically, addresses the Russian revolution of 1905.

A true Masterpiece from Eisentstein,"Battleship Potemkin is a celluloid masterpiece. The direction ofEisenstein is truly a sight. The film chronicles a ship of disgruntledsailors who are tired of being mistreated by their superior officers.Eventually, the sailors finally have enough of the abuse and send theofficers packing. During this time period, there was a shortage of filmstock in the Soviet Union. The goverment wanted to get their messageout to the people so they started a National Film Company and one ofthe members was Sergei Eisenstein. The films were shot on minisculebudgets and the shortage of film stock forced Eisentein to be carefuland selective with the footage that he shot. In the end, Eisenstein hadto reuse footage in order to make a feature length picture.The most famous of the action set pieces in this film is the muchtalked about massacre on the steps. This scene was spoofed in Bananasand most recently in Brian De Palma's The Untouchables. If you want tolearn film-making, I strongly advise you to watch Battleship Potemkin.It's one of the essentials.A+",10.0,Anonymous,History
Soviet propaganda masterpiece from Sergei Eisenstein,"The movie depicts a sailors mutiny on board the titular Russian vessel in the Black Sea. After shipboard conditions deteriorate, the sailors overthrow the ship's officers (and a clergyman), setting sail for Odessa for provisions. They are greeted as heroes by the people, but a contingent of Cossack soldiers begins to massacre the celebration. The cast includes Aleksandr Antonov, Vladimir Barskiy, Grigoriy Aleksandrov, and Ivan Bobrov.Potemkin is very much a case of style over substance. The story of the mutiny is thin, and there is little to no character development. The strength of this movie lies in its technique, specifically the editing, although shot framing is also innovative and compelling. The rapid-cut montage editing makes this the closest to a modern film of any of its era, aesthetically speaking. Quickly cutting from a closeup on a sailor's face to a shot of his clenched fist, then quickly to a closeup of a scared officer's face, then the feet of the sailor as he charges forward, and finally a medium shot of the two colliding, creates a visceral charge unlike anything else in movies at the time.The justly famous ""Odessa steps"" sequence, wherein panicked townsfolk scramble down a huge set of stairs as soldiers march toward them, firing their rifles into the crowd, is still an exhilarating bit of filmmaking. One prestigious European film society named this the greatest film ever made, period. I wouldn't go that far, but it still maintains its power to affect an audience near a hundred years later.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Must See,"""Battleship"" is the best example you will see of the montage editing used by the Russians in the 1920's.

So ahead of its time.,"After reading a biography on the last Russian Tzar (Nicholas II), and his failure to secure the army's support, I decided to give this film a try.I watched it with a completely open mind, not knowing anything about it (except its reputation).These are the things that impressed me the most.1) The shots of battleships, and the soldiers used as extras. More than once I stopped to think ""if this was done in this time and place, 80% of this would have been computer-generated"".2) The Realism  in it. From the maggot-infested meat to the shot of the sailor with his candle and the legend ""Killed for a bowl of soup"", this movie makes no concessions to the PC cause (which, thankfully, hadn't been invented yet).3) The slow descent into madness of the Odessa Steps sequence. From the first shot, when the limbless man appears, you get the idea something might be wrong; since the overall shots are composed, though, you end up feeling comfortable in your surroundings. Then an amputee appears, and people start falling in dramatic poses. Still, the shots are composed... until the Cossacks appear into scene, and the incredible shot juxtapositions appear. This scene is easily worth the price of admission.4) The fact that this movie is 100% unadulterated propaganda. Then again, when Rambo fought in Afghanistan he also was having something to do with ""propaganda""; only a different kind.Overall: a film marred by a bit of a slow narrative. Nevertheless, Metropolis, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and this movie are perfect examples of inventive, edgy movies that are still remembered for their merits today. They really make modern movies look boring and repetitive.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Hey, ""Adolf"" Putin, read this!!","FILMING OF OUTDOOR events on a truly grand scale is the hallmark of this film. It is obvious that there was near unlimited budget and an autocratic and absolute control exerted by the director, Comrade Sergei Eisenstein. The filming is done in such a carefully plotted manner as to appear to be an actual newsreel documentary.THE STORY IS a retelling of a 1905 incident of rebellion and mutiny against the hierarchy of the Imperial Czarist Russian Navy. It builds its tension with use of varying camera angles, liberal doses of editing, imaginative & original lighting and boldly placed bits of shocking realism.THE FILM IS very powerful and will hold just about anyone's interest for the duration of its time on the screen. We do recommend that anyone and everyone can and should see it at least once, But we do do with just one caveat to all.THAT PRECAUTIONARY WARNING would be that we all must remember that the movie is and was intended as a propaganda piece for the likes of Joe Stalin and his comrades the USSR. Director Eisenstein definitely knew of what side his bread was buttered as he carefully crafted the telling of this 1905 incident on the Black Sea as an allegorical work. In his capable hands & clapboard, the whole situation and all of the incidents surrounding it were reduced to metaphor for the Russian Revolution and the ascent of the Communist Party.DURING THE PROCESS of telling this story, the director actually manages to make a case for the dignity of man. Now that is just bizarre and ironic; when one considers the track record of the Kremlin masters. The Communist Party has always called itself: ""The Vanguard of the People"", no matter how many of their own people that they had to kill to prove it.",10.0,Anonymous,History

This Film Is Now Obsolete.,"Sergei Eisenstein wrote Battleship Potemkin as a revolutionary propaganda film, but also used it to test his theories of ""montage"". The revolutionary Soviet filmmakers were trying out the result of film editing upon audiences, and Eisenstein endeavored to edit the film in such a way as to generate the utmost emotional reaction, so that the viewer would feel compassion for the defiant sailors and extreme dislike for their pitiless overlords. In the style of most propaganda, the characterization is clearcut and uncomplicated so that the audience could unmistakably tell with whom they should identify.In both the Soviet Union and abroad, the film stunned audiences not so much for its political message as for its violence, which was explicit by the standards of the age. The film's capability of having great bearing on political ideas by means of emotional reaction was observed by Joseph Goebbels, who said ""anyone who had no firm political conviction could become a Bolshevik after seeing the film."" This remarkable influence felt and feared by tremendously powerful and influential people is something that never happens in regard to cinema today and hasn't for at least half a century now. Do you know why? Because film is a seminal part of life now. It is a part of the media, and it is easy to overlook one movie in favor of another, or film entirely for another facet of the media, like television. When this picture emerged, it was pure, ripe, brand new, almost surreal to its spectators. Eisenstein's theory of montage has been diluted and adulterated by now to the point where it is either completely ignored or thought of as kindergarten. In 1925, who would have though that a moving picture could provoke such a reaction? Who would have thought it had the capability to change someone who watched it?Now, this film is obsolete. Film-making has advanced too far for this film to have any kind of effect on the contemporary viewer. The dialogue, as in the title cards, feel too painfully scripted, due to having no need to acknowledge during the writing how people, especially common sailors, speak. The title cards that don't represent dialogue are so self-explanatory that they make the images futile and redundant. ""Bowl of soup."" Oh, really? There are great closeups of canons, but aside from them, there is no composition, which had not been established as firmly as Eisenstein's montage theory. One shot juxtaposed with another doesn't necessarily say it all. One has to direct the forces withing a shot for a cut to serve any purpose.I have tried this picture twice. I have felt nothing. The movie's legendary moment is in the scene of the slaughter of civilians on the Odessa Steps, in which soldiers shoot a mother who is pushing a baby in a carriage, and it rolls down the steps in the midst of the escaping mass. This image has been imitated in Brazil, The Untouchables, The Godfather, Joshua and 28 Weeks Later to name a few. These are the only ones of which I can think that I myself have seen, and each one has a more exciting ""Odessa steps sequence"" rendition than the original ""Odessa steps sequence."" There is nothing wrong or flat in Eisenstein's sequence. It is well shot and well edited, and why would so many great films imprint off of an unbearably boring film? Because to the generations to which their makers belong, it still had resonance, and it left an effect upon them.

Very dated now but a very good piece of propaganda,"I first saw this film when it was shown on the BBC for the first time in the seventies. I remember it being a real event, and feeling very sophisticated as I watched it.The reality today is a very dated film that is 90% fiction, with wooden acting and unbelievable events. However, it is of interest to me as a Naval historian and researcher, and the conditions it depicts are typical of the time. Of course, the German High Fleet and the Royal Navy didn't mutiny but conditions on board their ships were similar. It is also of interest for the filming of the small sail boats that go out to the Potemkin with provisions. Hundreds of them and it is an important film record of the type of craft still being used in the 1920s.As for the rest, so much of it never happened but it is etched onto peoples minds so much that people visit Odessa expecting to see a plaque or a statue commemorating the massacre on the steps.Once you know the true history I think the film loses some of its impact but as an example of film making, of its time, it will always be studied and commented on.

Historic and great,"Odessa, 1905. The crew of the Russian battleship Potemkin mutiny against their uncaring, sadistic officers and take over the ship. The mutiny starts an uprising against the tsarist government among the people of Odessa. However, the government sends a squadron of warships to bring the crew of the Potemkin to heel. Things look grim for the crew.Directed by Sergei Eisenstein, Battleship Potemkin is not just a landmark film in history, for its cinematic innovations, but a great film full stop. Great action, empathetic characters and plot and a fantastic cliff-hanger at the end.Eisenstein's main contribution to cinematic development was 'Soviet montage theory': through clever editing, the viewer is drawn into and carried along with the scene. A great example of this in Battleship Potemkin is the soldiers vs townsfolk scene on the steps. Through dozens of mini-scenes within the main scene, the dynamism, panic and horror of the situation are conveyed to the audience.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Well worth the effort.,"Remembering that the film was both a product and a tool of the Soviet political machine, the hatred of the Tsarists is evident throughout.  It takes discontented masses and charismatic leaders to spawn a revolution. The seeds of discontent are graphically illustrated in this classic production.  The charismatic leadership is not an issue in this movie, which is not surprising since they were no less evil then the Tsarists.The story is compellingly portrayed through the rapid transition of action sequences that should please even the short attention spans common in the MTV set.  No Hollywood Pretty People in this movie, each is distinctive and right for the role.  The grime on the faces, maggots in the food... the polished brass on deck, the bloodshed on the famous steps of Odessa... the story is a visual delight, though it was hard not to smile at the obvious propaganda promoting a classless society.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Has aged somewhat, but still must see for film buffs","Sergei Eisenstein's landmark film, from 1925, alerted western audiences that something important was happening in the Soviet Union in terms of film-making (Lenin: ""Cinema to us is the most important art""). The film itself deals with the 1905 uprising of the battleship of the title, how the crew of the ship rebelled against the czarist officers when they were asked to eat rotten meat, how after the mutiny the ship landed in the port of Odessa in the Black Sea (receiving the support of the population), and how the rebellion was suppressed by troops loyal to the regime. To achieve its effects, the film used the then new technique of rapid cutting. Elected in a film congress in 1959 as the best film ever, and still considered a classic, it hasn't aged that well. There is the famous scene of the repression at the Odessa steps, repeated so many times in TV, that are famous to even those who hadn't seen the movie. Whatever its failings, every film buff should see this movie at least once. Personally, I think Eisenstein made better movies, for example, ""Alexander Nevsky"" or ""Ivan the Terrible"". It is unfortunately true that cinema ages much faster than other forms of art. For example, one can read a novel written in the 1930s without much problems, yet most movies made in that decade look terribly dated now (I think many movies made in the 60s and 70s look dated).

Vivid & Memorable,"This classic is filled with vivid images that stay in your mind after you have watched it, and there is a lot to appreciate in the way that the key scenes were set up and photographed. The visuals are so impressive that the movie's imperfections are usually not so noticeable, and they don't keep it from being a memorable film.The movie certainly deserves the praise that it gets both for the influence that it has had, and for some ideas that for the time were most creative. The famed 'Odessa Steps' sequence alone demonstrates both fine technical skill and a keen awareness of how to drive home an image to an audience. It deserves to be one of cinema's best remembered sequences. Some of the other scenes also demonstrate, to a lesser degree, the same kind of skill.It says a lot for how effective all of the visuals are that so many viewers think so highly of ""Battleship Potemkin"" despite a story that is sometimes heavy-handed, and despite characters and acting that are both rather thin. These features might simply stem from the collectivist philosophy that lies behind the story, and they are obscured most of the time by Eisenstein's unsurpassed ability to present pictures that viewers will not forget.Despite the flaws, this is a movie that most fans of silent films, and anyone interested in the history of movies, will want to see. There's nothing else in its era that's quite like it.",,Anonymous,History
"Powefull, even today","When I was going to see this, it wasn't for anything else than film history (im not a film student, just very interested) I was shocked to find out how much I actually enjoyed it.The core power of the film is how the director got the viewer involved in the story, which Eisenstein was a master at. From when the crew on the battleship start to rebel, and the massacre, its all very powerful. The shots are beautiful, and the music is great. This went right into my top 10 films of all times, its a great work of art.The most memorable thing about the film though, was the massacre scene. There was many powerful shots, like the woman with her dead son in her arms, lots of people getting killed outright, and of course, the famous baby cradle scene.If one does not find appreciation in the value of the film, it should at least be appreciated for being one of the most influential films of the 20's.",10.0,Anonymous,History
still great after all these years,"Sergei Eisenstein's most famous movie has truly withstood the test of time. The story of a mutiny aboard a warship in 1905 does have the feeling of Soviet propaganda, but does a good job showing the conditions that led to the revolt. The scene on the Odessa steps should remain seared into anyone's mind.Okay, so ""The Battleship Potemkin"" wasn't actually the first movie to use montage, but they did a great job with it here. Certainly any film history class should show this movie. It's a great historical drama (although I will admit that I don't know how accurate it is).

I'm a Film student new to IMDb,"This film is a benchmark in non-mainstream cinema history.  The use of montage represents a quantum leap from the relatively simple juxtapositions of Strike (Eisenstein's 1st film).

Tsarists are massacring citizens on the steps,"This Sergei Eisenstein silent classic from 1927 chronicles (and embellishes) the true story of the uprising of the crew of the Battleship Potemkin in 1905. Their harsh captain and weaselly doctor are forcing them to eat maggoty meat and the crew has had enough. They revolt, killing 7 of the officers including the weaselly doctor. One of their crew is pursued and killed. When they dock at Odessa, they place the dead crew member in a tent on shore. Odessa was already a hotbed of socialist activity and many people come out to see the body. The government freaks out and sends the calvary (mostly unmounted) out to quell the crowd. They open fire and mow down many on the steps. This scene is graphic, exciting and heart-wrenching as we watch women and children get brutally shot by the heartless calvary. The Potemkin leaves and is pursued by warships who mean to bring it back.This movie is like a milk-chocolate Hershey bar. Or an anti Hershey bar since how can an all-American chocolate represent a, albeit brilliant, propaganda film supporting the Bolsheviks. Let me tell you how. When Hershey's developed their milk chocolate in the early 20th century, it was a huge breakthrough for the chocolate retards (the Americans). It became huge and Hershey's got a large contract with the U.S. Military. Soldiers all had Hershey bars in their rations. This helped spread Hershey's popularity and made the American soldiers popular with kids when they entered new cities. In a way, Hershey bars served as American propaganda. For their time, they were great, but compared the excellent European chocolate, Hershey's is waxy and tastes of sour milk. This film was absolutely brilliant for its time, but silent movies are not to many people's taste these days, nor is melodrama, as we've matured and moved on to bigger things. I enjoyed the film, had I seen it in 1927, I would have given it a 9. If someone had produced this film last year, I would give it a 4. Overall, I'm giving it a 7/10, weighting the historical significance higher than the actual enjoyment of the film on today's terms.http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies",7.0,Anonymous,History
You have ever seen editing like this before!,I liked the film although it was kind of hard to figure out what's happening in the end of the film when The Potemkin had meeting with the squadron. The legendary 'Odessa Steps' -sequence was even more spectacular than I expected. The editing really had a big effect on me.  It is interesting to think the film age and then observe the modern use of camera and editing. The other thing that took my attention was the movement of camera during the 'steps'.  I wouldn't have believed earlier that there had been a camera-trolley at all (or the length of the steps)  in the 1925's Soviet. Absolutely fantastic....,9.0,Anonymous,History
"Stunning Imagery, important but still I feel a bit romanticized even for the time","It is hard for me to criticize this movie because of its importance in cinematic history. As early as 1925, filmed images of large angry, determined masses of people were I am sure few and far in between. Something we take for granted with movies of our time like Hoffa.Battleship Potemkin, though a must see for any buff or one who appreciates historical events in their context, played out to me like too much of a cliché propaganda film. Obviously I know it was meant for propaganda purposes, so I cannot fault the movie for that. And again, as early as 1925, there wasn't really a mold yet for how propaganda films should look or feel. However, there was news footage, yes even then there was short filmed, propaganda packages with a concise point.The propaganda of this movie is sometimes just too blatant for me to appreciate it cinematically. Surely, in this time, we had yet to see the horrors and failures of 20th century forced collectivism, and in recent memory was far-right imperial rule in which made the living reality for everyday working men and women, (as always, the majority of the population) a living hell. So in this context, one may try to view this as a film that broke through some kind of barrier to catch that revolutionary spirit and heart of the everyday people who may see this film.But unfortunately I felt it could've done better. It didn't achieve this exactly at a human level, or a gut connection. The heroes and villains of this seemed too cardboard for me. With every officer, and a clergyman, as stiff oppressors,not one that was sympathetic. Hardly could this be 100% realistic when we are talking of human situations.I am glad I have finally watched this film. I look forward to watching more of Eisenstein's work.",6.0,Anonymous,History

It's not going to be the sort of thing you rent to watch when your Mum comes to stay over Christmas and it's not got much chance of getting chosen on an areoplane if The Fifth Element or Planet of the Apes are available, but it deserves great credit for even competing against the modern films.The fascination comes in seeing both footage shot 80 years ago and in seeing a snap shot of post-tsarist Russia. That the latter turned so sour dulls the enthusiasm of the modern viewer but it is, nevertheless, historically fascinating. As a piece of cinema it is also powerful and impressive....I'm no expert, but you can see there is real talent at work here from the director.

"The working, collective eye","I don't recommend that you see this as a 'landmark' in film; don't merely pass through to say you did, or because it's a travelled destination for most people. Instead, come to this with fresh eyes if you can. Rarely since has a film - and film tradition - been so deeply centered within its worldview, rarely indeed is a film made of the very fabric of the world it gives voice to. Most films these days are built at random, or from random spare parts.Eisenstein had already made a more successful film before this, more reflexively about the seeing eye. So, even though there is a more rip-roaring story here, you may have to struggle a bit with how faceless appears this world to us, these days so accustomed to the paradigm of the individual hero. But Eisenstein was an architect - literally, as well as in film - and so space matters, our relationship with space through motion matters.In other words; this may have been preserved to us as a museum piece, which is an indictment of our own understanding of cinema as coming down to us by the books and lists of assorted institutions, but at the time it was part of the most deeply revolutionary film school, one that rigged trains as movie studios and sent them scurrying the countryside to film the people and show them to themselves. I mean, here was a man - Eisenstein - who studied Japanese ideograms to understand synthesized image; who discovered that editing to the beats of the human heart affected more, true or false it shows the desire to both know and reach out.Our cinematic ideas have mostly regressed into mechanical reproduction since the time when these things were first engineered. Oh, there's plenty of Eisenstein every time you open the TV, but none of it is knowing. It's merely a matter of going-through-the-motions, without the blueprint anymore.So, look at how crowds are orchestrally conducted through stark geometries, how Eisenstein dissects cinematic space with even a stationary camera. But this type of cinema meant to agitate the people, was never about a thought, it was about an action.And so with this one. There is the one hero who, although dead, calls out to the people. They rush to him, like ships around their harbor. So on board the ship there is valiant effort for brotherhood and justice, inspired revolution; portside is the motherland, cheering the effort with aplomb. And in the end there is the hero ship, itself filled with heroes, now passing through a sea corridor lined with brother ships, all cheering the one. You can imagine the people cheering at the cinema, who had been there to cheer the real thing years ago.And when I say 'the real thing' I mean the revolution 8 years before; the Potemkin event depicted here was purely fictional. Yet by the famous steps at Odessa is erected a monument to the fictional sailors, what better example of cinema shaping reality?So yes, it is a revolutionary film. We may be inclined to make fun of the notions, or worse yet dismiss off-hand because of hindsight knowledge. But this was a film celebrating a time when the world seemed like it could be new again. Then came Stalin and, ironically, vanished all these filmmakers that sung the paeans.",,Anonymous,History
"I don't give a darn that it's been said a million times before: Battleship Potemkin simply IS one of the greatest films ever made, like it or not","I did something a little daring tonight when I watched this movie. I attempted to wean myself from silent movie scores. Sure, when this film originally was distributed, a piano score was probably played with it. Oftentimes, the director would choose the score himself (Charlie Chaplin often composed the scores of his later silent films). But most of the music you hear on VHS tapes over silent films is in no way the same music that was supposed to be played when the film was first released. And, then again, there were plenty of silent films that were played without a score. I do not know the history of Potemkin's score, so I decided to watch it for the medium this piece of art was produced within - film.Soon after I turned the music off, unaided (or should I say unimpeded) by the musical interpretation of the emotions on screen, I became utterly attached to the film. Visually, it is easily one of the most stunning of all films. Eisenstein was a master of composition. The editing, possibly the cinematic technique Eisenstein is most famous for (montage), is extraordinary. The mood of this film is anger, and it stirred my passions violently.It takes a lot of effort to enjoy a silent film, especially a drama, but films like Battleship Potemkin prove that this effort is entirely worth it. Come on! You owe it to yourself to watch this film! Your education is incomplete without it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A milestone in cinematic history!,"I cannot explain how influential Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin has been during the course of the last eighty years. Eisenstein's use of montage is extraordinary, flashing from one idea to another, and back again so quickly that you don't even realize that it is happening! Based on an actual mutiny that took place in Russia in 1905, Battleship Potemkin explores revolution through splicing together powerful images in a way that can, at times, literally take your breath away. The sheer brutality of the soldiers opening fire on the civilians at the shore of Odessa is truly horrifying! The intensity of the scene is truly unforgettable. The audience witnesses the chaos that comes from social uprising; children and mothers gunned down, baby carriages falling helplessly down flights of stairs. These are the visions which will stay with anyone who sees this movie. This particular scene is quite moving and disturbingly graphic. I am not sure, though, whether it is the power of the images, or the brilliance of the order in which they were placed that makes this movie such a force. Through his use of symbolism, powerful photography, and ingenious montage, Eisenstein created one of the most important and influential films of all time!",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Slow start, but a great second half","Battleship Potemkin is really a film of two halves. The first is a bit slow and sets the scene, showing the sailors mistreatment at the hands of their officers. Where it really livens up though, is once the action switches to the Odessa steps. Here the stirring music is the perfect accompaniment to the events and as the second half progresses a strong continual beating of the drum echoes the soldiers footsteps and indeed the heartbeats of the people you are watching. It helps build the tension until the drum is even syncing with your own heat beat as you become engrossed in the events. For me this is the true master stroke and the reason that I can let the first half go and still really recommend this film.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Shatters preconceptions of silent cinema,"So, I approached this in the way I guess people might approach silent movies - as something that was going to be clunky but quite interesting. I'd seen Metropolis - I thought I knew the form.I was impressed with the way Eisenstein captured everyday events on board the Potemkin. It has none of the fierce narrative drive of later movie, leaving the director free to show whatever he wants, anything he believes to be visually arresting. The use of boiling soup as a visual metaphor for conditions on board ship is inspired.The propaganda aspects verged between odd and amusing. Make no mistake this is a communist film. the crazy priest with the wild hair showing the communist disapproval of religion. At times it verges on the unbelievable - could one cry of ""Comrades!"" really stop an entire firing squad? And then I got to the most famous sequence - The Odessa steps. And that was where all my tolerant amusement shattered and fell to pieces.The Odessa steps sequence is savage. It's brutal. Like Salvador Dali's Un chien Andalu, it remains shocking even to this day. Blood, carnage and brutality.

But what I can comment on is that I really admired how "" The Odessa Steps"" sequence was very well done.

"Historically Important, But Not a Captivating Viewing Experience","Produced to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the Russian revolution, the silent epic Battleship Potemkin serves as both a historical drama and a passionate example of Soviet-friendly propaganda. Originally plotted to depict several key moments in the 1905 uprising, the state (which funded this production) demanded a tight deadline and the film was subsequently cut down to just one symbolic episode. In that, a crew of mistreated sailors bristle at the wormy meat they're provided and, when superiors ignore their complaints, stage an uprising that ignites a fire in the hearts and minds of civilians watching from the shore.From a filmmaking perspective, there's a lot to admire here. Utilizing a huge cast of extras, director Sergei Eisenstein brings us an abundance of expertly-composed panoramas, dazzling in their size and scope. Teems of people march to join the protest, clenching their fists and raging against the oppression like an angry human sea. Potemkin's use of montage was revolutionary for the time, and its heavy reliance upon manipulative visual storytelling remains potent today. It's also an ambitious example of the limitations inherent in silent film. Melodrama abounds; a flood of overly romantic body language and postured patriotic proclamations dominate the screen. Its depiction of the mutiny at sea is long, over-edited and confusing, desperate for a narrative guiding light amidst all the chaos. The same can be said for the famous Odessa Steps sequence, a powerful and historically significant act which depicts a bloody massacre by the military. One could argue that the disorientation evident in these scenes is intentional, an accurate depiction of pandemonium in a threatened crowd. I'd agree, but that doesn't make it any easier to follow. I don't think clarity needed to be discarded in order to enable the vision.My takeaway is this: Battleship Potemkin is an essential film when viewed through the context of cinematic achievement. It raises the bar for emotional heft in the format, manages some staggering vistas that surely hit the marks its Soviet bosses were looking for, and delivers one especially dynamic scene which has stood the test of time. I can't argue the artistry, but its storytelling is simplistic, cryptic and vague. The blame for that can't be lain at the feet of this era. Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd had already published masterworks by 1925, telling brighter, more lucid stories in a much lighter genre, and they didn't need the dozen pages of dialogue cards Potemkin uses to do so. It may be important in a historical sense, and the story behind its production and distribution is fascinating, but I've lost count of how many times this one's put me to sleep.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Masterful film-making from Sergei Eisenstein,"When ""Battleship Potemkin"" was released in Moscow back in 1925 it was described by some as the greatest film of all time. While I can't claim much familiarity with films predating 1925, I expect that those people were probably right. But what's truly astonishing is how well the film stands up, even today.The film tells the story of the crew of the Russian battleship Potemkin. Fed up with poor treatment, they revolt and overthrow their superiors. However, this accomplished, they meet the inevitable resistance from the military, whom they implore to join them. Predictably, the plot & intertitles savour of propaganda but not overwhelmingly so.Easily the most impressive aspect of the film is the visual aspect. Eisenstein's direction is impeccable but his editing techniques were nothing short of revolutionary. There's a reason why this film is still considered one of the greatest films of all time by countless critics.That's not the film's only drawing point, though. Nearly as impressive is the original score by Edmund Meisel. I watched the 2005 restoration where the score was adapted by Helmut Imig and I found it to be an integral element of the picture. Though there have been other scores for the film over the years I can't imagine any better than this one.Ultimately, while ""Battleship Potemkin"" is mainly notable for pioneering influential techniques it also functions as a rousing, tense historical drama. If you're a true lover of the art of cinema there's simply no excuse for not seeing this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,History
What About The Baby Carriage!!,"Sergei Eisenstein directs this Russian masterpiece; Eisenstein is known for so many great films, however, ""Battleship Potemkin"", is his stellar accomplishment as a director!! To date, ""Battleship Potemkin"" has persistently emerged as one of the greatest movies ever made with regards to the entire history of movie making for the overall gambit of film productions worldwide!! The esoteric expression of vitriolic mutiny in this film, was articulated with a vivid clarity!! The film ""Battleship Potemkin"" depicted a grass roots recognition for the overt social and political oppression that the Soviet Union's government was subjugating the Russian people to!! The auspices for revolutionary revolt was provoked by an almost non-human approach of imperviousness when dealing with living conditions that the unfortunate Russian masses had to live under!! They (The Russian people) were the ones who ultimately endured totalitarian torture, thus, the citizens of the USSR became the aggrieved party!! Russia has always had a penchant for evoking pathos concerning the poverty laden circumstances which wind up being the end result of an edict by an utterly unmitigated and abhorrent dictatorship!! The movie audience almost felt compelled to embrace an eleemosynary sentimentality for the vast majority of the Soviet Union's proletariat's struggle for survival!! This indigent plight of the Russian people became a widespread scenario which was a demoralizing element of the Soviet Union's dictatorial status quo!! This film broke ground on the illustrative syllogism which depicted the deplorable living conditions in Russia!! The classic staircase scene marked an unprecedented précis of bedlam emanating from relentless squalor, as well as doom and despair!! Brian DiPalma (Fanous director who directed ""The Untouchables"") attempted a duplication scene of the baby carriage going down the staircase. It would stand to reason that such classic cinematic genius that ""Battleship Potemkin"" illustrated with this scene would be subject to imitations by subsequent movies; that is almost something that is inevitable!! What is so remarkable about this movie is that just because it was made when only silent pictures were around, did not mean that this film conveyed any less of a socially poignant message!! The fact that this film was silent became an aspect to ""Battleship Potemkin"" that actually enhanced this picture a great deal!!

In fact, if one were to have The Odessa Steps segment in a film today, it would be met with with the same jaw-dropping amazement as it must have been in 1925.Besides his brilliant montages, Eisenstein gives us some awesome visual moments - the parades of people walking down to the ship, the fuel of the ship curling out against the ocean sky; the sails on the water, and the dramatic way the film ends as the ship moves toward us - all breathtaking.But I am in complete amazement over The Odessa Steps segment, the entire thing, of which the massacre on the steps is a part.

Epic Propaganda,"Undoubtedly one of the most influential movies from the silent years of cinema, Sergei Eisenstein's recounting of the 1905 naval mutiny by sailors on the Potemkin has been referenced by so many other movies that you'd be forgiven for thinking that much of its power would have faded over the years. It is perhaps then a measure of the technical accomplishment of the 27-year-old director that the film looks remarkably fresh today and still possesses the ability to move modern-day viewers.The story is a deceptively simple one, focusing more on the actions of the people/proletariat as a whole than any particular individuals, and yet it is laden with a symbolism that relentlessly hammers home the propagandistic ideology of its Communist party backers. It is impossible to see the events unfold with an unbiased eye because all who fall outside of the Party's rigorously defined circle of revolutionary heroes are portrayed as weasel-like characters who stroke their waxed moustaches while caring nothing for the plight of those beneath them. No doubt there must have been an element of this at the time, but this one-sided depiction simply reinforces the impression that we are watching a none-too-subtle exercise in what can perhaps most charitably be described as occasional deviation from reality.Technically, however, the film excels. While abandoning any particularly characterisation, Eisenstein focuses on the human face of the revolution by having Eduard Tisse's camera pay close attention to the faces of the participants. He constantly uses close-ups on a wide range of characters to show us the heroic stoic features of the young sailors, the seamed faces of grieving women, the heartless smirks of ship's officers and even the hypocritical standards of the church. Eisenstein's pioneering of montage and overlapping editing is much in evidence. The first rebellious act, the smashing of a plate by a disgusted sailor is shown from different angles, giving an action that would take only an instant in real time a power and resonance that would otherwise be difficult to create. Later, when a sneering member of the bourgeoisie sneeringly heckles a woman protester, the reaction shot of a man turning around is edited so that a close-up frame is sandwiched been medium shots, giving the moment an immediacy and element of threat. It's the mark of a cinematic genius and must have been incredibly heady stuff to see back in the 1920s - it isn't difficult to see how such mastery of editing technique would have inspired a generation of movie makers.The film is packed with memorable sequences, the most intense and powerful of which is the famous Odessa Steps sequence. If ever the genius of Eisenstein was in doubt one would only have to point at this incredible sequence that still manages to excite and horrify an audience eighty years after it was filmed. While mainstream audiences might find this film difficult to watch today, true cinema aficionados will recognise it for the early masterpiece it is. It's just a shame so few of us will get the opportunity to experience its power on a full-size cinema screen",8.0,Anonymous,History
A breathe-taking and innovative film,"Silent cinema has a special delight because sometimes you can't express with dialog an idea that can be shown in a single frame. In ""Battleship Potemkin"" we find a young and inspired Eisenstein that wanted to do something for the upcoming anniversary of the October Revolution. The famous case of the rebel crew of the Potemkin and the Odessa massacre looked like the perfect plot for a director with unique vision. This film took Eisenstein to glory and to hatred. Why? Foreign film critics considered the film as a work of art (which it is) but the Russian people and politicians hated it because it gave ""a bad image"" of the USSR. After some good but forgotten films (""October"" is a nice example), Eisenstein ran away from his detractors and finished his life filming some ambitious films in Mexico and Japan. Sergei became the European version of Orson Welles: no film of his after ""Potemkin"" became as famous or recognized. Something curious happens with this movie: every time you watch it you find something new and fascinating about it. After 20 times I watched it, I realized that not only is the finest editing work in the history of cinema, is one of the greatest and spectacular war films of all time.

A sense of proportion,"I don't want to be controversial just for the sake of it, but I have to ask if this really is the classic it is supposed to be.It is often quite exciting in a purely visceral way and has some striking images and memorable sequences (the Odessa Steps being the most celebrated), but has little or no emotional depth and is rarely moving.In essence it is a piece of fairly crude Communist propaganda, so its undoubted technical merits have to be seen in the light of what it was promoting. In 1925, the worst may still have been in the future but the Leninist wind had been sown and the Stalinist whirlwind was soon to be reaped. I feel as uncomfortable praising this movie as praising Leni Riefenstal's work.As for its technical merits, have they not also been somewhat overblown? Of course, Eisenstein orchestrates images very well and any film company in the world at that time would have been happy to employ him. But as good as he was, there were many other film-makers doing similar things and sometimes doing them just as well.If this movie has had any lasting influence on cinema (which is doubtful) it is probably on second unit directors, shooting crowd scenes and action sequences, rather than on other major artists. Some of the most striking moments (the famous lion statues, for example) were pure silent cinema and within a couple of years these 'innovations' were largely redundant.The irony is that Eisenstein's own masterpiece, Ivan the Terrible, has far more in common with Dreyer's Passion of Joan of Arc than it does with this movie. Similarly, more recent Russian directors like Tarkovsky were more influenced by Ivan than by Battleship.I suspect this picture was lionised chiefly by critics and cultural pundits who were only occasional movie-goers and who were once memorably described by Andrew Sarris as 'slummers from the other arts'. In short, people who had no real idea how movies were made and had seen very few of the other movies that were crucial benchmarks for a proper evaluation of this one. They credited Eisenstein with inventing what all half-decent movie-makers had routinely been doing for a decade.Battleship Potemkin is undoubtedly of some historical interest, but it is not a great work of art (by a long stretch), it is not nearly as original or innovative as movie-illiterates have often claimed and its ultimate impact on the development of movie technique has been hugely overestimated.This movie is certainly worth watching at least once or twice on its own merits.

A Classic Soviet Propaganda Film That Influenced the Entire Western World,"Filmed throughout the year of 1925; Potemkin was first brought about when director Sergi Eisenstein was commissioned in March of 1925 to make a feature on the 20th anniversary of the beginning of the revolution in 1905. What the final script came out was a script that ran over a hundred pages in length (big for that time) and would attempt to highlight all the main actions and events that happened up to the revolution.Altogether looking at the film now it can be understandable why the film was banned from any Western countries for nearly 30 years. It's a full ahead propaganda film for the early name Soviet Union. But wonderfully made film.One of the most memorable and harrowing scenes in the film is the 'Odessa Steps' massacre. A set piece that only lengthed for at least 3 pages in the script but would become one of the most celebrated and most used sequences in the world of cinema. What makes 'The Odessa Steps' so great tho is nothing that it is shot; but the way in which the sequence is edited to together with fast cutting shots added together, which would come about being called 'Montage Editing'; the quick shots of a woman crying, of soldiers marching down the steps firing volleys into the fleeing cowards, the shot back to the woman with blood over her face then one's of soldier's feet marching gives the impression of force and power.The only problem is with the film is that it gives the impression that it lasts too long; the full version which was re-cut when it was allowed to enter Western cinema's (or even straight to video) was cut down to 63 minutes, from the 189 minute oringal (in which sadly the negative of the epic has been lost somewhere in russia and would probably never be found). The film carries on to long; into which the acting is very poor. But that can be understandble for a silent film; and especially a film of this scale.The reason for such over the top acting is how can you bring about your charcter's views or opinions in any other way. You can't with sound; because their wasn't any, you can't with continues dialogue captions, because the audience would become to anoyed for reading all the time and not watching in which is the main reason for the cinema, to show moving images that astound the audience. If the film didn't astound the audinece; then the 'Odessa Steps' scene does for film makers later on in the cinema. With films such as:Woody Allen's 'Bannas' (1971) Terry Gilliam's 'Brazil' (1985) Brain DePalma's 'The Untouchables' (1987) and even Leslie Nielson's 'Naked Gun 2 1/2 The Smell of Fear (1991)If anymore interest in the Soviet Cinema in the 1920's check out ""Strike"" as well.",8.0,Anonymous,History
An awe-inspiring film of truly grand stature,"I have only recently become aware of this film but have been more than inspired by it. It's portrayal of the heroism of Revolution is perfect and uncliched. It is a movie a million miles ahead of all other films of it's age. It boldly but sympathetically portrays the massacre of the rebellious workers and sailors and their fight.It is a touching tail of those prepared to die for that which is right and symbol of the Russian identity made only 8 years after the Revolution succeeded and 1 year after the death of Lenin. It was made in an untainted Soviet Union before the terrors of Stalinism began.This movie should be recognised as the classic that it is and one essential in film-making history. It was a joy to watch and is one of my favourite movies.It is a sublime piece of modern art, a grim portrayal of Tsarist Russia and a symbol of hope for better times.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Battleship Potemkin,"I'm never one to turn a film down, unless it's got Ben Affleck in it, then i'm always hesitant. But alas, i recently received an invite to a 1925 silent Russian film named Battle Potemkin, and once it was confirmed Ben Affleck was not in this film, i was good to go. Showing at London's Southbank, i was excited to see a silent film in the cinema, something i've never done before, and also excited to see a film called by many critics as one of the great films of the 20th century.The film is a bit of revolutionary propaganda, dealing with the plight of a rebellious set of sailors, and from the minute it begins it is clear that these sailors are the heroes of the film. What follows is five brief episodes (the films is only 70 minutes long) which charts the mutiny led by the sailors against their heinous officers. Soon enough the whole of the City (Odessa for those keeping count) revolts and in a magnificent piece of film-making (especially considering this was made 86 years ago) there is a stampede which is brutally captured and wouldn't look out of a place in a low-budget film made today. The finale of the film is a triumph and strangely uplifiting, who woulda guessed a Russian mutiny would evoke such emotion??!This film is a great way to introduce somebody to silent films, it is relatively short and moves at a great speed. One thing i loved about the lack of dialogue was the focus instead on the visual aspects of the film, as an audience member you also have more space to look at facial expressions and mannerisms without being held back by subtitles, and this is where the attachment to the film really comes alive. I would give this film an 8/10, it's different, and has certainly got me interested in silent films, now, where's that Charlie Chaplin DVD?",8.0,Anonymous,History
One of the most innovative films ever,"This is a film that I think is regarded as a classic more for its influence than for its quality or watchability. I do think it is a good film, but I've seen it ranked at or near the top of many film polls, and I don't see why. Since personally I don't rank films on their status as innovative works or on their historical importance. That's for the scholars and film historians. My take on it is this - there are gripping scenes, rather incredible use of editing and structure, and a good use of music to pump up the story. But it's also very much a propaganda film, it's very cold (despite the baby carriage), and I don't find it all that affecting. It is undeniably a film of great importance, but I don't think it's as great as the polls make it out to be. But everyone should see it at least once.",7.0,Anonymous,History
The Moment When Editing Became an Art,"In all respects that matter, this film hasn't aged a day.Sure, the story is hamfisted, but so what? It's basically a propaganda movie. I'm not watching it for depth of character. That's not the reason it has endured. Sure, it's almost dreadfully short, but so what? Films can show a lot in 69 minutes if they don't dawdle, and this film doesn't even think about dawdling.Through and through, it feels like a 20's movie, but it feels like how you want 20's movies to feel, how 20's movies have been portrayed as feeling by our nostalgia for that time as well as the Hollywood Machine itself. Most twenties movies, while charming, lack cinematic sophistication. The actors can be funny or poignant, but the effects are lacking and the camera work looks like it was done by someone who had never been to film school. Many end up feeling like half-finished films. It's hard to embrace films from that era, even films that I want to like and are interesting, such as Nosferatu or the original King Kong, because of this. I can appreciate them, but appreciation does not translate perfectly into affection.This film is different. I wouldn't go so far as to call it the best film I've ever seen, as some film critics have, but it is definitely a awe-inspiring accomplishment. It's not only astonishingly good, it's astonishingly good in a dynamic, electrifying way. The title cards don't just exist to provide information- they punctuate the story beats. Each scene flows into the next. Each part flows into the next. There are montages and elaborate wide shots and quick, clever cuts. It's better on a technical scale than most films released today.Nothing is done without a purpose though. Every shot and trick furthers some thought or feeling. It's both lean and remarkably ambitious. It does not run for three hours, but it tries and mostly succeeds to capture the emotions of the audience. Eisenstein knew what he was doing; he had to. Many of the creative technical work was his invention. When Hollywood filmmakers saw this film, they were shocked. They had never seen anything like it before.This deserves a place among the films that changed absolutely everything. Just like there is a pre-Citizen Kane era and a post-Citizen Kane era, there is a pre-Potemkin era and a post-Potemkin era. Every film buff has their favorite Potemkin shot. Mine is the long shot on the steps where the woman holding her injured son is shot by the Cossacks.Back in the day, even people who didn't know exactly what made this movie special couldn't stop thinking about it. Fundamentally, it is different from every film that was made beforehand. Even now, I can hardly think of a film that's made me care so much about a scenario I would have otherwise cared so little about.I've repeatedly said that even as an outsider from the 21st century, it's possible to tell an innovator from a copier. Even if you didn't know anything about Star Wars, it's easy to differentiate it from the works that copied off it. The original carries itself with a poise, an energy that the copiers just don't have. It's in the 'blood' of the film, if you will. This film has that. I can see myself rewatching it over and over again. It's one of the most gripping motion pictures of the 20th century.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"Innovative? Maybe.  Good Film? Good God, NO!","The version I saw was a '70's restoration that ran for 74 minutes.  I understand that originally it ran 183 minutes.  I could have chopped out another 20-30 minutes and lost none of the relevant content.  Don't take this the wrong way; I do have a long attention span and am in no way opposed to an epic.  This film is not an epic.  This film is a short that has been filled out with a lot of recycled footage.  For instance,  The Odessan populace flowing down the steps to the waterfront is about 10 minutes long but uses about 1 minute of footage looped.  This is like dead air on the radio.  The same 5 second snippet of sailors brawling during the mutiny is spliced in so many times amongst other footage that I lost count.  The acting and plot are horrible by silent film standards (think BAD melodrama). The only slightly redeeming quality in the film is the Odessa Steps massacre montage but, unless you are taking a class on film editing, AVOID THIS FILM.",2.0,Anonymous,History
Outstanding but overrated work.  Eisenstein's other work is much more interesting.,"The first time I saw Potemkin, I must have been around 12, and Ibet it was the first silent drama I'd seen, after Metropolis. I hated it.I saw it recently again, along with a couple of other Eisensteinpictures. While I felt that Strike and October were both superiorfilms, I really liked Potemkin a lot more.Now, also I understand more some of the things Eisenstein wasdoing with editing and camera work. I would like to point out, tothose who say Eisenstein invented ""montage"", that D.W. Griffithwas doing the same thing ten years earlier. Extreme close-upscame around in 1903, with films like The Gay Shoe Clerk.Tracking shots are in a huge number of films predating this film byalmost a decade (Intolerance, Cabiria). No, Eisenstein did notinvent these visual tools. Nor did he really perfect them (I doubtanyone has truly done that). What he did was try to utilize them tocreate a stirring and powerful cinematic experience, which hecertainly did.One thing I love about Eisenstein's films is his use of ""types"",really distinctive-looking actors. The citizens of Odessa lookfascinating, especially the wealthy-looking woman with the veiledhat. The ship's creepy-looking, bearded and mustachioed doctorwas very effective as an evil presence just asking to be overthrown.Eisenstein also provides us with plenty of beefy, sexy sailors,which you really can't complain about. Those opening scenes arepretty hot, if you ask me.So, overall, this is a good film. I like the acting, the camerawork,the editing. However, I wish film professors would stop showingthe Odessa steps sequence in their classes. Young students withno understanding of Soviet cinema will watch that and promptlygive up on the genre. The scene feels clumsy and disconnectedtoday, and plays on the common misperception that all silent filmwas overstated gesturing and unrealistic character decisions. Atleast they're not showing them Earth (I hope).",,Anonymous,History
A True Masterpiece,"I have now seen this film twice. I didn't care for it the first time but upon a second viewing I have grown to appreciate it. I think it is fair to call this a masterpiece in terms of political propaganda.Eisenstein's use of crowds is pretty stunning to watch. While the modern U.S audience may be frustrated with the lack of character development, I found the crowds to be particularly engaging to watch. Again, keep in mind this film has to do with the politics of the time. If one really pays attention to the film it is clear the Eisenstein really did a great job at portraying life on a ship, the Odessa steps etc. I think it is easy to classify this movie as an under- appreciated piece because of its non-narrative structure. However, no one can dispute that the Odessa steps sequence is one of the most famous in all the history of cinema. Eisenstien uses montage to really provoke the audience's emotions and it is heart wrenching to watch the small child and mother be killed. This section really brought a lot of emotion to the film and I loved it. Obviously, the music has been re-mastered but I loved what it added to the film. If you have seen this film once, then see it again because I think a second viewing will really help you understand it better.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"A Russian classic film based on the historical events, the movie tells the story of a riot at the battleship Potemkin.","In the midst of the Russian Revolution of 1905, the crew of the battleship Potemkin mutiny against the brutal, tyrannical regime of the vessel's officers. The sailors gradually complained about the conditions on the battleship, the rotten food and the mistreatment of their superiors and eventually planned a mutiny. What began as a protest strike when the crew was given rotten meat for dinner ended in a riot. The sailors raised the red flag and tried to ignite the revolution in their home port Odessa. The resulting street demonstration in Odessa brings on a police massacre. The Sensational Russian Film which is astounding all Europe !. Revolution is the only lawful, equal, effectual war. It was in Russia that this war was declared and begun.Exciting, dynamic and direct, few films can rival its ability to capture the danger, drama, uncertainty and energy of the civil war. The famous recreation, in documentary style, of the key events of the failed revolution of Kronstadt of 1905 against Tsarist oppression, reissued in 1998 in a new edition with music by Shostakovich that replaced Meisel's original soundtrack. It exemplifies, as we know well, Eisenstein's fascination with montage and the typification of non-professional actors, chosen according to their physical characteristics. A revolutionary film in full form, in political objective and in theme, its virtuoso technique remains dazzling and is at the service of a revolutionary fervor that we can still experience. This, however, is as much communist propaganda as it is artistic and, looking back after more than 90 years, there is something cold, artificial, academic, and even manipulative about the meticulous compositions, schematic characterizations and complex choreographies of the mass movement, especially on the steps of Odessa. There is no doubt that the whole is a technical tour de force, but the obsession with the forces of power, as opposed to individual experience, is ultimately oppressive.There's an overwhelming camerawork by cameraman Edward Tisse, that remains still impressive. The film is considered to be a masterpiece, but lacks the genuinely fiery passion of Eisenstein's early ¨Strike¨, not to mention the lyricism of Dovzhenko or the perky wit of Vertov. Sergei Eisenstein was the most known Russian director and writer; being especially known for his prestigious works as Ivan the Terrible part I and part II (1944), Alexander Nevsky (1938), ¡Que viva México! (1933), and Bronenosets Potemkin (1925). He was one of the founders of the world's oldest film school, VGIK in Moscow (1919), and along with Lev Kuleshov, Vsevolod Pudovkin, Aleksandr Dovzhenko, Mikhail Romm, Eduard Tisse and Anatoli Golovnya, worked out the basic methods of professional training, which produced such well-known giants as Sergei Parajanov, and Andrei Tarkovsky, and the more obscure masters Mikhail Vartanov and Artavazd Peleshian. Deemed to be the father of the cinematic montage, Eisenstein often used heavily edited sequences for emotional impact and historical propaganda, his most famous being the Odessa Steps sequence in Battleship Potemkin. In 1998, the Bank of Russia issued a pair of two-rouble coins commemorating the 100th anniversary of Eisenstein's birth. 15,000 of each coin were minted; the obverse side of each coin depicts a two-headed eagle, the Bank of Russia inscription, the denomination of the coin, and its year of minting. On the reverse of one coin is an image of Eisenstein holding a piece of film, the battleship Potemkin, as featured in Eisenstein's film, a reproduction of Eisenstein's signature, and the legend ""Serge Eisenstein 1898-1948"".

Save my baby.,"Sound: The orchestral score written for this film synchs well and helps drive the tension and energy of the film. There even is am homage to Tchaikovsky's 1812 overture by using Le Marsellaise in the score. 
90/100Technical: Poor use of the ship model. Eisenstein breaks the 180 degree plane a couple of times. The montage editing drives the pace and tension of the film. Excellent use of framing and camera angles. 
95/100Narrative: Episodic in 5 parts but it flows together. Weak ending if the film was not for propaganda use. 
100/100Acting/Character: Excellent acting for the era. Eisenstein is not afraid of using close ups of the supporting cast; great faces too. Superb use of the different ranks and groups to signify the proletariat, bourgeoisie, and the elite classes; for the propaganda use. 
95/100Did I like it: Yes, but if the ending were true to the real actions of the Soviet Union the ending would have had more bloodshed.

One good scene and a whole lotta nonsense,"I'm not going to lie, I did not enjoy this. I appreciate the importance of the film and the enormous steps it took for early cinema but wow, I was so excited for it to be over. Obviously the context of the film is incredibly important, and it is vital to note that this is a propaganda film. That being said, there aren't really characters. It's like there were just two: the people and the soldiers. The stair scene is just as legendary as it is hailed to be. Halfway through it I noticed my jaw was dropped open as much as possible. I've been watching early films lately and I must say that the violence is shocking. It's not especially graphic or even realistically performed, but the reasons they have to start fighting and the quickness of it was jarring. These soldiers just gunning down civilians was incredibly disturbing and I can't believe that that is a thing that happened, and continues to happen. There were a lot of creative angles and techniques used, absolutely. Just the way the story was told left me guessing a lot. Wasn't a lot of build-up to action, it was just suddenly inaction to action- and since I didn't know what was going on all the time, it was really confusing. Just not a format I'm used to, but I'm working on it.There were so many points where I was like ""okay, I GET IT"" like so many repetitive shots and close-ups held for far too long. There were a lot of shots that should have been cut shorter because it would continue on even after the characters were mostly out of frame. There was one scene where two people walk away and the scene keeps going until all we can see is their ankles and I was like, ""ok, what do these ankles symbolize"" Just kidding, haha, I mean I can't knock this film too much because it's truly an important part of the foundation of modern cinema, and these guys were out there with nothing but ideas and some film equipment. They didn't have film schools, they didn't have movies to watch and study, they didn't have books about filmmaking. I do appreciate this movie's contribution to film but I did not have a good time watching this film. The story didn't do it for me and the shooting style was extremely frustrating to watch. The stair scene is worth a viewing, but I don't intend to watch this again. Not sure why any government would endorse/pay for this, but I'll never pretend to understand Russia.Did I enjoy it?

Libyans dream of being this rebellious,"1925 was 86 years ago. That was when Sergei Eisenstein's 'Battleship Potemkin' was first released. Hailed then as an exemplary piece of propaganda the film continues, in the minds of many cineastes, to stand the test of time.As the opening credits rolled, I had this sort of giddy feeling, a feeling that I was experiencing history. This feeling soon faded. Most of the audience were people closer in origin to 1925 than me. That's not to say you have to be 'old' to watch and enjoy 'Battleship', but it's no coincidence that most of those lovely folk were in fact 'old'.People will debate on IMDb and elsewhere about how relevant the themes remain and how it endures as a seminal piece of film-making (it clearly inspired Brian De Palma's train station sequence in his 'The Untouchables'), but the ultimate question when judging any film is 'Is it enjoyable?' My answer is: It isn't.The episode – four, I think it was – called 'The Odessa Steps' was the only sequence I, if not enjoyed, then certainly didn't roll my eyes at. It's the scene where a vast army of Odessans rise up against the tyranny under which a sailor is killed, and are then routinely massacred by Tsarist troops. It comes on suddenly and is relentlessly violent. It's a familiar boast from directors nowadays, but it boggles the mind to think how Eisenstein controlled such frenzied scenes.Look closely at the praise and you'll see that critics only really praise this episode. Why? Is the rest of the film not as impressive to them? Can a film really be considered among the greatest based on any one scene? Of course not.If until then I had enjoyed the film, I would have felt cheated by the ending. Without spoiling it, there is a fairly effective crescendo of tension before a highly anticlimactic climax. I thought afterward that, were this story one of fiction, ending on the steps could have been a much more powerful ending. Allowing the oppressors the victory would have been the stronger condemnation of tyranny instead of the convenient real-life one Eisenstein understandably went with, given the era he made it in.Even Roger Ebert, whom many consider to be the greatest of all living critics, demonstrated not a fine balancing of opinions, but a contradiction. After praising 'Battleship' to the hilt, he ended his review by saying, 'The fact is, Potemkin doesn't really stand alone, but depends for its power upon the social situation in which it is shown... it suffers when it is seen apart from its context (just as 'The Graduate', by striking the perfect note for 1967, strikes a dated note now). It needs the right audience.'Unless you have an assignment to write on this film, don't feel compelled to see it. I can't recommend it because on this occasion I can't even say I was at least glad to have had the experience.www.scottishreview.net",5.0,Anonymous,History

Short notes on Eisenstein as a film maker,"This is an example of film making under almost unique circumstances; in many ways Eisenstein's success could be attributed to the situation under which his films were made; but this belies the fact that he was an extraordinary talent.  Potemkin contains imagery which even now is light years ahead of most standard, good film making.  His ability to draw drama is second to none; witness in particular the famous scene upon the steps which pits helpless civilians against seemingly invincible soldiers.  However beyond Eisenstein's aesthetics, it is worth noting the despair which engulfs this film; as a director he spares no emotion.  To think what audiences of the 1920's made of this film is mind boggling; by todays standards it is not only epic but virtuoso; a depth that many film makers can only aspire to. However, despite all which I have said about this film in such a brief time, it's success ultimately rests upon the fact that it is unparallelled entertainment, more excitement and earthly fear than any other film that has since followed.  Cinema, it would seem, peaked too early.",10.0,Anonymous,History

The theory witch cinema is owed to until the very today, and I can say even the most important event in cinema. from Citizen Kane, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Jurassic Park and The Lord of the Rings, you can see its trace. and yet nobody have understood the theory like Eisenstein did it itself. you can't imagine what pictures are awaiting you. he product ""Battleship Potemkin"" in 20s. in that time cinema doesn't even have sound. but the beautifulness is that even without sound there's no need for him to say what he wants. PICTURES TALK FOR THEMSELVES. you even don't see too many incoming text as you used to see in silent movies. PICTURE TALK FOR THEMSELVES. Pure Cinema. Eisenstein is a Genius. when you become more precise on shots you ask yourself: ""How did He Shot These in 1925?""

"Worth watching, but suffers from being a propaganda film","A lot of people note that director Sergei Eisenstein was ahead of his time with his 'film montage' technique, used so effectively in the massacre scene on the steps of Odessa, but it should also be noted that he captures brilliant images throughout this movie. It's certainly worth watching as a result, and is probably a must for students of film. However, what undoubtedly stirred emotions in 1925 – possibly sympathy for the communist movement, or fear of inciting revolutionary thoughts given the mutiny that takes place on the Potemkin, or squeamishness at the moments of violence (all of which contributed to the film being banned in many countries, including the Soviet Union!) – is less impactful ninety years later. It also suffers for being a propaganda film, with less nuance in its characters and plot.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"A ""Revolutionary"" Movie","The necessary prerequisite for watching this silent classic is, of course, that you understand that it's a piece of communist propaganda, produced in the Soviet Union in 1925 as Stalin was solidifying his hold on power. (In fact, I thought the actor who played Vakulinchuk - the hero of the mutineers - even looked a bit like Stalin, probably deliberately, since it wouldn't hurt Stalin's image to be associated with the movie's hero, although it is interesting that Stalin was not always a great supporter of director Sergei Eisenstein's work or of his views on communism.)The first half of the movie is very strong. Opening with a quote from Lenin glorifying revolution in general, the story begins with the crew of the Potemkin being given rotten, maggot-infested meat to eat. Along with other brutal treatment and the contempt with which they were treated by their officers, everything leads up to a mutiny by the sailors, as they turn viciously on their officers and take over the ship. One could read into this a warning about the dangers of revolution - revolutionaries can become just as vicious and oppressive toward those who used to be their oppressors, as the oppressors were in the first place! (That might be deliberate, since part of Eisenstein's problem with Stalin was founded in his belief that film-makers should have creative freedom - hardly what Stalin wanted to offer them!) The first half of the movie very effectively builds sympathy from the viewer about conditions for the Potemkin's crew, and the mutiny itself was very well portrayed. The first half would surely gain an 8/10.Unfortunately, this movie is nowhere near as strong in the second half. There are very long stretches of basically nothing from about the 35 minute mark on. In very long scenes, the people of Odessa stream to the pier to pay homage to the sailors, the people of Odessa flee from the authorities as they attempt to re-establish control and the sailors wait for what could be a titanic confrontation with ships from a Russian squadron obviously sent to get things under control. There really was very little that interested me in the second half of the movie and, of course - given the propaganda purpose of the movie - the crew of the Potemkin are portrayed in the end as glorious victors, whereas in reality they ended up having to surrender to authorities in Romania, having accomplished little except giving Eisenstein a great story that could be easily twisted into propaganda by the Soviet Union.Overall, based largely on that very strong first half, I'd give this a 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Silent Trend-Setter,"Eisenstein's film about an episode in the Russian Revolution is one of the most famous films of all time and still one which surprisingly few people have actually seen.Undoubtedly, we have here a piece of propaganda cinema: the film maker is clearly on the side of the common soldiers rebelling against their aristocratic and bourgeois officers and exploiters.  This may put some people off, but notice that this is more open and honest in its approach than many western films of the cold war era in which the outcome (who's the good guy?) is as predictable as it is here but in which the viewer is fooled into thinking that it is not.The reason Battleship Potemkin is famous is not because of the acting performances: most actors weren't even professionals and the acting is quite often outrageously over the top, although it is fair to say that this is a problem of many silent movies.  No, the reasons this is a famous film are (i) the clever use of editing, and (ii) the even cleverer use of imagery.  The perhaps most famous scene of the film shows a deserted pram hobbling down the stairs.  It is a symbol of the violence against civilians that just preceded it and in its way it is even more powerful than the actual act itself.  The film is full of such symbols, probably too many for a 1990s audience, but back then it was new and it left a deep impression on its contemporaries and it proved to be highly influential on film makers.",,Anonymous,History
Very good but lost much of its power.,"The main problem with The Battleship Potemkin is that it is a propaganda film, meant to celebrate Communism and the Soviet state it was made in. It tells of the rebellion of the crew of a battleship in Czarist Russia, which is joined by a rebellion on land by oppressed peasants.  There are no well-defined characters, and a minimal narrative.  In addition, the violence depicted has lost much of its shock value, making the film that much less potent.That said, this is still a very well-made and relatively powerful film, for what it is.  The cinematography and editing are both good-looking and eye-catching, even if some of the sequences seem to drag on for no good reason while nothing seems to happen.  The famous massacre scene makes up for lost power with technique, as faceless machinelike soldiers steadily march towards the all-too-human crowd.  Also, the climactic confrontation is laced with tension as the Potemkin sail toward the Czarist fleet, while the camera cuts from the Potemkin preparing for battle and calling upon its fellow soldiers to join them, and the approaching fleet.Many consider this to be Eisenstein's (""the king of cinema"", to some) best film. While it is very good, I would recommend his ""The Strike"" which deals with a similar event and which I found to be even more powerful.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Charlie Chaplin's favorite movie,"An unique achievement in cinema that continues to amaze even after all these years.Eisenstein didn't reinvent the reel with his film, but combined existing film-making techniques that had been used individually by other silent film directors – such as montage, tracking shots and extreme close-ups – for maximum effect in telling the story of a mutiny at sea and subsequent mayhem on land.In 1905, the armored cruiser Potemkin is returning to Odessa on the Black Sea from defeat in the Russian-Japanese war. The conditions on board are abysmal and the sailors rebel, eventually taking over the ship. The sympathetic people of Odessa help them by bringing them food, only to face a bloody reprisal from Tsarist troops in a famous but fictional sequence on the steps of the city leading down to the beach. Well, they do occasionally say that life's a beach.Eisenstein's artful editing, which in addition to illustrating his dialectical editing theory of point, counterpoint, fusion, elecits tremendous empathy for the sailors and citizens of Odessa, sparking the viewer's sense of moral outrage. This power to galvanize audiences led to the film being banned by several governments, even (shudder to think!) the Soviet Union under Stalin.Reportedly, this was Charlie Chaplin's favorite movie.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A Classic in Russian Cinema and Montage Filmmaking,"This was an excellent movie. There is a huge amount of historical significance to this film, in the realm of history and film history. The elements of montage filmmaking within this film are what makes it great. Despite the fact that it was made for a Russian audience that had endured years of political turbulence, the film holds particular elements that can also attract a younger audience, often with no knowledge of the history surrounding the film. That, is what truly makes ""Battleship Potemkin' a great film; it goes beyond the limits of language and promotes a historical quality within filmmaking. The film's narrative, which follows a traditional structure, is easy to follow, and is only interrupted by intense moments which contain elements of montage filmmaking. These elements add quite a bit to the film, showing the disjointed state of politics within Russia during this period and highlighting the traditional narrative structure. The film's altering of the actual historical ending of the revolution within Russia actually fits well with the structure of the film, but also is seem by some critics as a blatant promotion of Russian nationalism.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A silent movie that needs no words,"Im not going to go into the plot or technical brilliance of the film, that has been done by lots of other posts, just to say this film works in my opinion not least because it is a great action film,there is largely no need for dialogue since the actions and acting is largely self explanatory, the use of subtitles is minimal and only used when required to move the narrative along, the soundtrack is also vital to the film and really does help the emotional roller-coaster of revolutionary fervour that swells among the crew of the potemkin and people of odessa, hard to find fault with the story or execution although the guy who says "" kill the jews"" must be the most stupid man in all of mother Russia ! for a film to be 80 years old and still provide real entertainment and a bit of a history lesson, is a real achievement, great stuff!:)",8.0,Anonymous,History
The only one Potemkin...,"""Battleship Potemkin"" is one of the most famous movies in history and is also considered as one of the masterpieces of world cinema. In this movie we watch a protest strike that started when the crew was given rotten meat for dinner and ended in a riot. After that the sailors raised the red flag and tried to start the revolution in their home port Odessa.This movie is divided into five episodes which are:1) 'Men and Maggots', in which the sailors protest because they gave them to eat rotten meat, 2) 'Drama on the Deck', in which the sailors mutiny and their leader (Vakulinchuk) is killed, 3) 'A Dead Man Calls for Justice' in which Vakulinchuk's body is lament by the people of Odessa, 4) 'The Odessa Staircase', in which Tsarist soldiers massacre the Odessans, 5) 'The Rendezvous with the Squadron', in which after all of these the sailors cheer on the rebellious battleship and join the mutiny.Some things that we have to mention about this movie are that is based on historical events and shows us everything about the Battleship Potemkin. I liked this movie because of the direction of Sergei M. Eisenstein which I found very good and also for the music.Finally I have to say that ""Battleship Potemkin"" is fairly considered as one of the best movies in the history of cinema and I strongly recommend it to everyone who is a fan of cinema. This movie is very well divided into episodes which give us a better view about what happened back then and also make us understand better the history behind this.",7.0,Anonymous,History

An epic but overrated propaganda,"When you read that Battleship Potemkin is a propaganda movie, please be aware that this does not mean that the movie just has a revolutionary tone or a political message, like Birth of a Nation. No, it very literally is a propaganda film where one side is getting viciously vilified and the other side is being wholly victimized. There is a very clear motivational message.This is different from your average epic that has a clear villain and a clear protagonist. Such exaggeration of characters is normally done for the viewer's benefit because its gives the viewer to reason to root for the main hero and to be happy when that hero succeeds. In propaganda films it is not for the viewer's benefit and you can feel that! Propaganda films feel preachy and pushy as their purpose is not entertainment, even though they may be entertaining in the process. Such films therefore have a disgusting core, and unfortunately, for all its epic feel and cinematic genious, Battleship Potemkin is no different.It is not just propaganda but very ludicrous propaganda and on occasion misses its mark or is hilariously corny. A grown man gets slapped on the back a couple of times in his sleep and that gets him crying. It just feels awkward, like the movie is trying to look for trouble everywhere, clutching at straws.Other times, it just does not explain things well. There is a scene where the men look at an officer with contempt but does not give a reason for it. I later realised it was because the sailors were refusing to eat.Visually Battleship Potemkin is very impressive. A few confusing scenes aside, it is very good at conveying its propaganda with simple to understand messages and symbolism. It is also good at creating tension, surprise, atmosphere and just showing off some pretty maritime scenery. There are a few interesting special effects and cool camera movements during the famous stairway sequence.However, as already mentioned, it goes overboard with the its propaganda. There are other oddities too, like a gun clearly not pointing at a person and yet the person falls to the ground anyway after the gun is fired. There are also several scenes that drag on for too long, with nothing important happening, and that in a movie that is only about an hour long. If you cut out all the unnecessary bits, the movie would probably not be more than 30 minutes. It only has 3 events to show (divided into 5 parts).The best thing about this film was the music. It was not just providing the mood but also the sound effects for what was happening on screen, which was not a standard thing for silent movies at the time, and the music managed to do so without losing its flow and without stopping the music. The score has a bombastic modern feel to it of a Hans Zimmer composition but a timeless sensibility of classical music.Now, I should probably point out that, if you see the modern version of the movie, you will likely get the remastered version of the soundtrack. No doubt the original quality would have been lower.The most pleasant thing about this film is its presentation, consisting of an epic and lively soundtrack and visuals. But its story is presented awkwardly, with the political pushing being painfully obvious and with other awkwardness in the screenplay. This cannot be ignored because it directly affects what you see.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Dynamic Masterpiece,"It's sixty-six minutes of perhaps the most arresting imagery in movie history, also one of the most dynamic. Every shot includes movement of some kind, whether people, smoke, guns, or the prow of history overtaking us. There's no scene of focal conversation, let alone silent talk. Thus politics of revolt remain largely unregistered. Instead the symbolism of rotten meat force-fed to sailors sums up crumbling Tsarist rule. The revolt is told in compelling movement, crowds rushing to and fro, Tsarist forces ahead or behind. One after another, the human wave cascades, with hardly time to breathe. Surely, the Odessa Steps is one of the most memorable in all moviedom; at the same time, a common humanity is deepened-- the dead baby, the shattered eyeglasses. Yes, the 1905 revolt failed. But seed was planted taking down Tsarist rule but ten years later. No need to go on—the film's brilliance is there for all to see, and remains so though not a word is spoken. It's Eisenstein's masterpiece, an enduring one-of-a-kind.",,Anonymous,History
"Not everyone will like this, but it is a fascinating movie.....","The Battleship Potemkin is now the oldest film I have ever seen. I didn't know what I'd think of it as I had never seen a silent film before. I was amazed. Cinema owes this movie for what it has done. Some people see it as a precious collectible only to be enjoyed from time to time but it is much more. It is a dramatic and emotional experience of anguish. There are many scenes from this film which are now famous. The baby carriage rolling down the stairs in the middle of a massacre is the most famous. The whole scene is tragic, suspenseful and wonderfully filmed.Although there is little or no character development, I felt the anguish the sailors felt. I felt sorry for the people during the massacre. The plot is minimal, but that doesn't make the movie boring. I was never bored during those 75 mins.

A lesson in editing a lot of film makers should learn nowadays,"The fact that I watched this laying in bed in a Sunday night, without loosing my attention or even falling into the embrace of Morpheus, already says a lot. For starters, the soundtrack is a good way to engage you in the movie. Plotwise, it is an interesting story to contextualize the spirit of the Russian revolution. Albeit heavily propagandized, which sometimes may throw you off if you're not particularly crazy about the ideology, the plot still provides for some entertaining 75 minutes, while complementing what, to me, is the focal point of the film. The way ahead of its time editing and cinematography. It may not come to one's mind while watching the movie, but in a time when editing consisted in cutting and glueing film rolls together, it takes a tremendous amount of work to create a movie where some shots last less than a second. It is so common today, with digital film making, that it is easy to forget how big an accomplishment Battleship Potemkin is. This would, of course, be rendered forgettable if not used ingeniously by Eisenstein to immerse the viewer so deeply in the atmosphere of the story. After reading about his 5 methods of montage, it is clear how he uses every single one in the movie, and how much it serves to enhance the plot. If just watching the Massacre at Odessa scene, without over-analyzing, is already quite an experience, watching it again after knowing what's behind is even further enriching. The cinematography is good as well, particularly in scenery of the port of Odessa, with great examples of high contrast and lighting. Again, this was 1925, and, visually, it is still miles ahead of a great deal of movies I see today.I am truly never tired of watching movies from this period, where the movie industry was not dominated by one single market, and I advise anyone to watch this movie to show that not all the great things in cinema were made in Hollywood.""Killed for a plate of soup""",9.0,Anonymous,History
Early masterpiece of cinema,The Battleship Potemkin is now the oldest film I've seen and it is also the first silent film I've seen. I heard a lot of good things about this movie so I got the tape out at home and I watched it. When it ended I just thought that this was a classic masterpiece. The story is based on the real-life Russian Battleship Potemkin. You wouldn't think it but some of it was sad and disgusting. Sad being that the mother dies and the pram rolls down the stairway and disgusting being they have to eat rotten meat with maggots in it.Today it is still considered to be one of the best silent and Russian films ever made. I think that everyone should see it (if they can find it.) You will be presently surprised at how good it is. It's a must see classic. 5/5.,10.0,Anonymous,History
The Rising,"I only became aware of Battleship Potemkin when Brian De Palma's The Untouchable's was released for the cinema and critics mentioned the pram down the steps sequence and how the director borrowed it from this film.This Russian silent celebrates the Potemkin uprising of 1905 which Lenin regarded as an event that sowed the seeds of the The Russian Revolution. This is a fictionalised retelling by Sergei Eisenstein.The crew of the battleship are mutinous because of poor rations, meat infested with maggots but the officers pass it as fit for consumption. The crew will not back down so the officers throw tarpaulin over some of the rebellious crew, give them the last rites and are ordered to be shot.One of the crew members Vakulinchuk pleads to the firing squad not to fire and the firing squad does not and it leads to mutiny as the officers are overcome.The uprising in the ship travels far and wide and in the town of Odessa, Vakulinchuk who was killed in the mutiny, his body is displayed to the public. In the Odessa steps a gathering crowd are fired on by Tsarist troops where women and children are killed leading to a pram with a baby plummeting down the steps. The massacre never happened, it was made up for the film.The film is propaganda to symbolize the spirit of the Russian revolution. Sergei Eisenstein made an epic film with vast crowd sequences, montage editing techniques and is a technical accomplishment for the early days of cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Battleship Potemkin,"Battleship Potemkin, The (1925)**** (out of 4)Eisenstein's masterpiece film tells the 1905 Russian naval mutiny in five parts. It goes without saying that this is one of the greatest films ever made and one of the most beautiful as well. The most famous thing about this movie is the Odessa Steps sequence, which is clearly one of the most memorable scenes in film history but the rest of the movie never really gets the credit it deserves. I think the second part of the film with the mutiny on board the ship is just as impressive and there are some of the most suspenseful scenes in film history here. The execution sequence is incredibly suspenseful as we get closer to the sailors execution after they are put under a tarp. As for the Odessa Steps sequence, I'm really not sure I could say anything that hasn't already been said countless times. This massacre sequence is so brutal and shocking that it hasn't lost any of its impact over the past eighty-years. How Eisenstein was able to get all these extras is something remarkable on its own and it's easy to see why this film was banned in several countries because government officials thought this sequence could lead to riots. The technical beauty of this film is unlike many others as every single shot is like great poetry right on the screen.

"What's black and white and red all over? ""Battleship Potemkin""!","As is true with so many films, silent and sound both, ""Battleship Potemkin"" gains classic, indeed iconic, status very much because of the accompanying score.I have seen ""Battleship Potemkin"" several times, including a (I think) tenth-year anniversary edition with a new score, and one I remember very admiringly. (I saw it in a film class at Los Angeles Valley College.)However, on the night of 13 November 2016, Turner Classic Movies presented ""Battleship Potemkin"" with what is billed as the original 1926 score, ""newly recorded.""Magnificent!Extraordinary!The pounding beat accelerates with the action, matching perfectly with what is seen, and urging the audience into edge-of-the seat anticipation.As many times as I have seen, and been enthralled by, ""Battleship Potemkin,"" I do not remember seeing the one colorized shot. It is, yes, part of the communist propaganda, but actually adds to the drama of the movie.Bear in mind, please, that my earliest years included membership in Young Americans for Freedom, as well as a dose of common sense, so even the greatest communist propaganda finds no fertile soil in my heart or mind. But every time I see ""Battleship Potemkin"" I am tempted, however briefly, to seek out a CPUSA membership form.Director Sergei Eisenstein proclaimed his admiration of D.W. Griffith and never hesitated to credit Griffith with having taught him the art and skill of editing.""Battleship Potemkin"" uses editing in part to propagandize, but more so to advance the story.In addition to skilled and dramatic editing, Eisenstein used a brilliant moving camera, especially at The Steps (if you haven't seen this before, I don't want to give anything away, but you'll see quickly what I mean) to, again, tell the story, but to tell it in so dramatic a fashion, any thoughtful person, and even just the person seeking a movie to relax and enjoy, will be caught up and moved and excited and fascinated.Eisenstein was his own editor, and this was only his second feature film, and that he was a rare genius is immediately obvious.Bear in mind this was financed by the Soviet government, for its own purposes, so Eisenstein's huge crowds and the availability of the Soviet navy are understood, but they help make this one of the greatest movies of all time.As propaganda, ""Battleship Potemkin"" is occasionally obvious, even blatant, but as a movie, it is simply -- to repeat -- one of the greatest of all time.I cannot stress too much how strongly I recommend ""Battleship Potemkin.""Probably there are several versions around for home consumption, but do try to see the one with the enhanced original score. Composer Edmund Meisel has very little information given about him at TCM, but there is a Wikipedia article on him here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_MeiselProbably Turner Classic Movies will present this again, and I'm hoping it will be available On Demand.

The political message is questionable but technically this movie is a milestone,"The works of Dziga Vertov and Sergei Eisenstein in the early days of Soviet Union's cinema easily beats anything Hollywood published at the same time. The score is bombastic, the images are intense and the avant-garde camera shootings and runs are innovating. Even a century after its creation, the scenes on the Odessa staircase are still highly impressive.For Eisenstein, cinema was an art with many facets and his attraction montage fusions the meanings of images, words and music into a powerful and baffling piece of art. This movie works a lot with contrasts. You can see the small and dark rooms of the sailors and the big and light rooms of the tsarist officers. You can see the beautiful dishes with religious inscriptions for the rich personal on board and the foul dead meat for the sailors. You can see the sadness of a despaired woman that loses her young child that is shot in the back while you can see the pitiless army that creates an incredible bloodbath. The movie focuses on the rebellion and solidarity of a crowd and not of a single hero and already represents early Soviet ideals but the acting of many single persons is simply incredible and very close to theatre if you take a look at the expression on the faces of the actors. This movie is filled with details and close to perfection from an artistic point of view.Of course, there is a lot of symbolism in the movie and a lot of propaganda but as censorship wasn't yet as extreme as it would be during the next three decades under the tyranny of a powerful madman called Stalin this movie still portrays the opinion of Eisenstein who comes from Latvia that had been annexed by the Russian tsar. It's more a revolutionary movie than a propaganda movie and is not so far from true historic facts as it is the case for movie such as ""The Birth Of A Nation"" or ""Der Jude Süss"". Still, this slight slices of propaganda are reason enough to cut off one point from the final rating.This is a truly artistic movie that any fan of cinema should at least once see in his lifetime. If you haven't seen it yet and doubt its quality, don't hesitate any longer. Even if the political message is definitely questionable, this short flick is definitely bombastic, epic and always entertaining.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Brilliant; Seldom Equaled,"Based on actual events of 1905, silent film THE BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN concerns an Imperial Russian ship on which abominable conditions lead to a mutiny. Shocked by conditions on the ship, citizens of the port city Odessa rally to the mutineers' support--and in consequence find themselves at the mercy of Imperial forces, who attack the civilian supporters with savage force.POTEMKIN is a film in which individual characters are much less important than the groups and crowds of which they are members, and it achieves its incredible power by showing the clash of the groups and crowds in a series of extraordinarily visualized and edited sequences. Amazingly, each of these sequences manage to top the previous one, and the film actually builds in power as it moves from the mutiny to the citizen's rally to the massacre on the Odessa steps--the latter of which is among the most famous sequences in all of film history. Filming largely where the real events actually occurred, director Eisenstein's vision is extraordinary as he builds--not only from sequence to sequence but from moment to moment within each sequence--some of the most memorable images ever committed to film.To describe POTEMKIN as a great film is something of an understatement. It is an absolute essential, an absolute necessity to any one seriously interested in cinema as an art form, purely visual cinema at its most brilliant, often imitated, seldom equaled, never bested.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",10.0,Anonymous,History
One of the most influential films of all time,"When the film was made in 1925, it quickly established a film editing as one of the key elements of film language and radically changed cinema. Indeed, when we're watching this film it's hard to believe that was shot in distant 1925. However, Battleship Potemkin should not be viewed as a museum artifact. Today, as almost one hundred years ago, it calls to revolt against oppression and oppressors, and its powerful propaganda message carries the energy of not only the past but also the future revolutions.In 1918 Sergei Eisenstein left the studies of architecture and joined the Russian Revolution, where he became a revolutionary propagandist. Together with Dziga Vertov and others he developed a new cinematic language that went out to change the cinema forever. Eisenstein wanted to stir the emotions and inspire viewers of his short films, and in this way to put the new art, cinematography, in the service of the Revolution. By far the strongest and longest lasting effects achieved his feature films Strike, October and above all Battleship Potemkin which soon upon release inspired hundreds of thousands of viewers, among them hundreds of future film directors. Luis Buñuel said that this movie changed his life and decisively influenced his decision to become a film director.Historically, sailors' mutiny on the imperial Russian military ship ""Potemkin"" of June 27, foretold the first, unsuccessful, Russian revolution that erupted in October 1905, and was crushed in December that same year.During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904/05 most of the sailors of the Black Sea fleet were transferred to the Pacific, leaving ships with mostly inexperienced recruits and less capable officers. In this situation, the Central Committee of the Social Democratic Organization of the Black Sea Fleet, called ""Tsentralka"" made a decision to start preparations for the simultaneous revolt on all ships of the Black Sea Fleet. The first rebellion erupted on ""Potemkin"", when on 27 June 1905, the deputy commander of the ship threatened to shot sailors who refused to eat maggoty meat. After a short struggle sailors took control of the ship and on the same evening sailed in Odessa flying a red flag.Based on actual events.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Cinematic History!,"Battleship Potemkin might not strike people as the most entertaining film, but if you think of the storied history this film brings, it's hard to not love it. Sergei Eisenstein cultivated his theory of Soviet Montage, which has evolved into editing as we know it today. This film is a phenomenal example of beautiful and meaningful editing. The cohesive silent story is so much in part due to the editing used by Eisenstein and his crew. Like I stated earlier, this film isn't the most entertaining, but it does have some fairly entertaining moments. The beautiful editing makes the staircase scene so much more enjoyable and makes a truly immersive experience. Overall a must-watch for a cinephile, seeing as it is an integral part of cinema as we know it.",7.0,Anonymous,History
its fame was well earned,"All true cinephiles know about ""Potemkin"" and how it revolutionized cinematic techniques in editing. We all know about that insane, constantly referenced/parodied Odessa steps sequence, but do we really know WHY ""Potemkin"" is a GREAT movie? Not just an influential or famous movie, but an actually GREAT movie?Well, in my opinion, the reason that ""Potemkin"" is so great is its ability to manipulate emotions and have relentless emotional energy and thrills. In its slim 70 minute runtime, more emotional intensity has struck the audience than in most 2 hour action thrillers. This film may be communist propaganda, but its also damn good communist propaganda. I may not agree with the film's political intent, but while I'm watching it I sure do! Using the power of film and visuals, Eisenstein works as a master manipulator, pulling at every string in your body, a surging sea of pain and sorrow exploding across his forever influential screen. Who could ever forget those haunting images? The child being trampled on! The baby carriage falling! The old woman with her shot out! Blood everywhere! Tons of extras falling down these mammoth stairs. Its more thrilling than any horror film you've ever seen, and its damned brilliant if you ask me!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Technically Great but Historically Wrong!!!,"I appreciate the efforts of Sergei Eisenstein for making the important movie. The technical efforts of the crew is really sacred and especially important for cinema, but the meaningful concept of the movie is something that I don't appreciate at all. I mean it clearly support the Russian 1919 Revolution without showing any harmful aspect of it. The movie shows how Russian guards and army fought against Revolution. The movie is trying to tell us that the Revolution happened by the will of people as it only shows people, especially the poor ones as the front line's soldiers. The stairs scene is one of the most important and famous scenes in history of Cinema, but it has too many technical problem because it doesn't seem real, although we can accept the problems as there were too many limits at that era for making such scene. Anyway, I think 1919 Revolution wasn't only about poor and rich and Russian armies and guards weren't always the ones who killed people in conflicts. As we know Bolsheviks we're really cruel as they killed too many people from the past regime, especially the whole family of Tsar. As we know nowadays, that Revolution wasn't gonna help workers, farmers and poor people, it only made their lives harder.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Wow,"I was quite moved by Battleship Potemkin. I had shivers up my spine through so much of it: the firing squad scene, the plate with the religious phrase on it, the scene where the leader is hanging on a life-raft, the incredible crowd scenes, but most strikingly, the Odessa steps massacre. The nuanced performances are some of the most subtle and effective i've seen in silent films, though this is more of an action film than a straight drama, truth be told. I was surprised to find myself cheering for the revolutionaries on the Potemkin, and was in awe of the power of Eisenstein's cinema.The Odessa steps sequence is one of the finest things i've ever seen: the glorious tracking shots down the steps, the fast-paced editing, the little boy being shot, then the close-ups of his hands being trampled on by the crowd fleeing from the Cossacks, then finally the magestic moment of his mother carrying him in her arms in the pieta position, walking angrily towards the marching, descending row of Cossacks, demanding restitution. The most powerful single shot i've ever seen is the shot from behind her, carrying her boy in her arms, walking towards the ordered ranks of Cossacks, who march towards her. The famous pram down the steps is marvellously chilling, as is the woman shot through the eye of her glasses.I look forward to checking out more Eisenstein. This is my first, at time of writing, and i was very impressed.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Influential,"A film with no main character, far less a character you can identify with, and no plot in the conventional sense of the word. 'Battleship Potemkin' goes directly against the viewing habits of people used to the American style of film making. At its centre are types rather than individuals: The sailor, the officer, the student, the mother, and so on. In the climactic scene of the film - the massacre on the Odessa steps - many of these types merge to become a 'mass' of people in a way perfectly suited to Soviet ideology. The photography in this scene is stunning, with tsarist infantery mechanically moving down the steps and mechanically firing into the fleeing masses. However, there are many other impressive scenes: the hand-coloured red flag rising, scenes of naval life and ships moving in the harbour during sunset and so on. What impressed me less were the long scenes showing the people of Odessa deciding to support the mutineers of the Potemkin: In a silent film, showing persons involved in long heated discussions does not work so well (despite lots of gesticulation). 'Battleship Potemkin' is certainly one of the most influential films of all times. Is it also one of the best? Not for someone who likes films to have a proper plot, good acting and interesting individuals with interesting conflicts - someone like me, in short.",7.0,Anonymous,History
This movie is straight garbage.,"And not because it's propaganda. Because it aged like milk.The story is too drawn out. The pacing is painfully slow. 1 hour felt like 4. Jump-cuts remind of early youtube. There is a lot of vomit-inducing imagery. The actors are so bad they must have been hired off the street.The only value it has is film history one. Stay away from this movie!The Russian battleship Potemkin (romanized: Kniaz Potyomkin Tavricheskiy, ""Prince Potemkin of Taurida"") was a pre-dreadnought battleship built for the Imperial Russian Navy's Black Sea Fleet. She became famous when the crew rebelled against the officers in June 1905 (during that year's revolution), which is now viewed as a first step towards the Russian Revolution of 1917. The mutiny later formed the basis of Sergei Eisenstein's 1925 silent film Battleship Potemkin.After the mutineers sought asylum in Constanta, Romania, and after the Russians recovered the ship, her name was changed to Panteleimon. She accidentally sank a Russian submarine in 1909 and was badly damaged when she ran aground in 1911. During World War I, Panteleimon participated in the Battle of Cape Sarych in late 1914. She covered several bombardments of the Bosphorus fortifications in early 1915, including one where the ship was attacked by the Ottoman battlecruiser Yavuz Sultan Selim - Panteleimon and the other Russian pre-dreadnoughts present drove her off before she could inflict any serious damage. The ship was relegated to secondary roles after Russia's first dreadnought battleship entered service in late 1915. She was by then obsolete and was reduced to reserve in 1918 in Sevastopol.Panteleimon was captured when the Germans took Sevastopol in May 1918 and was handed over to the Allies after the Armistice in November 1918. Her engines were destroyed by the British in 1919 when they withdrew from Sevastopol to prevent the advancing Bolsheviks from using them against the White Russians. The ship was abandoned when the Whites evacuated the Crimea in 1920 and was finally scrapped by the Soviets in 1923.",2.0,Anonymous,History
Six Star Excellence,"Bronenosets Potyomkin/Battleship Potemkin(1925) was made to comemorate the twentifth anniversary of the Russian Rebellion of 1905.

applicable to even today's world issues,"Like the other features in the box set, Battleship Potemkin opens with an epigraph by communist leader Joseph Stalin about revolution being the only justifiable war, the film's rebellious undertones and convictions of equality are immediately embedded from the get go.Eisenstein's montages depicting the masses is a crown bejewelled with sparkling moments as the dust settles - only for this to be disturbed and gears changed to quick cut-away and repetitive shots to further elevate our own sympathy towards both the crowd and the sailors. The contrast of the sweeping and panning montages captures the true chaos and power of a crowd that produces feelings of claustrophobia, as well as a close bond towards the nameless faces we have come to recognise.In a way, events that shaped the noughties, such as the war on terror and the conflicts arising in the middle east over the Taliban's restriction of human rights, contain themes, dilemmas and strife that make the film's core values applicable to even today's world issues, whatever an individual's beliefs.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Where a social revolution and cinematic revolution merged.,"A study in heroics. A call to violent revolution. A propaganda piece. A work of homo erotic art. A story for the ages. A commercial success only in the west....Sergei Eisenstein's first full-length feature is all of those. It's also the movie that brought his name to international audiences, forever. Arguably, few movie directors reach that pinnacle of fame so early in life - Eisenstein being only twenty-seven when Battleship Potemkin (BP) was released. Such is artistic genius.The story, largely based upon the actual facts of history, follows no single protagonist; for Eisenstein, the working class is paramount, represented by the sailors and the people of Odessa. The visual narrative shows the sailors taking over the ship, steaming on to Odessa, gaining the support of the local population and finally venturing forth to sea again to meet the Tsar's opposing naval forces who, against the odds, did not fire a single shot in anger, allowing BP to pass through the cordon to freedom. The mutineers had won, a metaphor so strong that, at a later time, Lenin called the entire incident ""a dress rehearsal"" for the 1917 revolution.On the other hand, although some of the local Odessa population were in fact killed by Tsarist troops, the massacre on the Odessa steps - a seven minute, seminal montage of exquisite action forever copied by others - was entirely Eisenstein's fiction. Moreover, the mutineers did not truly win: after sailing through the opposing fleet, BP was eventually retaken by Russian authorities at a Romanian port on the Black Sea. Other minor aspects of the story were also changed to suit Eisenstein's creative inspirations. Good storytellers, though, never let facts hinder creativity.Of greater visual importance, I think, is the long, slow sequence of thousands of local people descending to the dockyards to file past the body of Vakulinchuk (Antonov), the valiant leader of the mutineers, who was shot to death by one of the officers. Regardless of how many turned out in reality, Eisenstein's cameras capture the mood and reality of those times with a mix of sharp, extreme close- ups and long shots of staggering complexity and a cast of thousands.I saw this movie first in 1968 or 69. Forty-five years have not dimmed the imagery I recall so vividly when I saw it again recently. It's that sort of movie. Along with Strike (1925) made soon after BP, these are cinematic icons you cannot afford to miss, especially if you consider yourself a movie aficionado.No movie ever gets a ten from this reviewer. If I could give this 9.9, I would, however. Recommended for all.April 5th, 2015.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Of Men and Maggots...,"Battleship Potemkin is by general consensus Eisenstein's masterpiece. Coming between the over-the-top action melodrama of Strike and the formalist documentary style of October, it's the most ""normal"" looking of his silent films. Rather than being overly stylised it best demonstrates how the montage technique can be used in regular cinematic storytelling.Eisenstein here takes the editing techniques he perfected in his first film Strike, and uses them to greater effect in telling the story, creating tension and staging action. Whereas the action in Strike was almost relentless, Potemkin contains moments of stillness and calmness which act as a counterpoint to the more exciting situations, making them tenser and more effective. He stretches out time to an incredible extent, sometimes even splitting sentences over two title cards. He also slows things down to give certain scenes greater consideration. The section in which Vakulinchuk's body is brought to the pier and visited by Odessa citizens has a slow tranquillity to it, which gives it an air of sadness.When Battleship Potemkin does burst into moments of action, the direction is tighter than ever. Looking at the most famous sequence  The Odessa Steps massacre  the scenes of mass panic begin before we are actually shown what is causing them. If you watch closely, you can see how well directed the crowd scenes are. It's not just a hundred or so people dashing madly down the steps, there are also for example some people confusedly trying to cut across the crowd, implying Eisenstein directed the group at the level of individuals, and took real care composing each shot.On that note, although Eisenstein's silent cinema is characterless and based around the actions of masses of people rather, he still has respect for the individual, and often uses the action or experience of one person to hammer home a message. For example, the opening sequences with the sailors becoming tense and angry all builds up to that one man smashing a plate. Later in the Odessa harbour, shots of the crowd are intercut with close-ups of fists clenching. And of course although the Odessa Steps sequence involves hundreds of people, it's the individuals that we remember most  the mother and child, the woman with the pram, the man with no legs and so on. Eisenstein also makes the impact of the set pieces all the greater by introducing us to these ""characters"" just prior to the massacre.Eisenstein's symbolism, which was rather heavy handed in Strike, is here much subtler and cleverer. It is also much more skilfully woven into the narrative. For example, when Vakulinchuk makes his first big speech, he is both literally and metaphorically waking up the other sailors. Later, the boiling soup is used as a metaphor for the sailors seething with rage. Even the title of the first part  the Men and the Maggots can be taken as a reference to the difference between the sailors (""real"" men) and the despicable officers who command them.Eisenstein is also now a little more reserved in his use of artificial cinematic techniques, such as superimpositions and lens masking. These techniques were all over the place in Strike, but here they just crop up once or twice, giving them greater impact when they do appear. It also shows more confidence in his own direction  he doesn't have to rely on cinematic trickery to hold the audience's attention anymore.Eisenstein's silent pictures are arguably the most totally cinematic of their era. By taking the possibilities of the editing process to their extremes, he follows on from D.W. Griffith to further cut cinema free from its ties to theatre and literature, helping establish it as a unique storytelling form. As a result Eisenstein's other silent pictures sometimes suffer from too much style over substance. However, in Battleship Potemkin, he not only perfects the use of montage, but does so without compromising as much on the drama and storytelling, and that is why it's his best film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Men or 'Maggots'...,"It was surprising that a silent film could be so easy to watch. The economy with which it has been edited and the films structure itself are the main elements that contribute to this.The film really captures the spirit of the revolution that it is dealing with - you really sympathise with the sailors and citizens. Of course, this film has it's own agenda, but as it is a practically redundant cause, it can be viewed as a piece of entertainment in a much clearer sense.The tension created on the screen is excellent - starting with the battleship itself, and then moving onto the mainland. Things escalate believably and for a film of it's era, it really is quite unflinching in revealing the sacrifices made by the characters in the film.This really is worth sitting through, (that is if you can adjust your modern viewing habits for 90mins).",8.0,Anonymous,History
Contemplative infancy,"Eisenstein's Potemkin isn't necessarily his best work, but there is something suitably gripping and epic in his approach, and the historical aspects of the film are always interesting to look at. In 1925 the cinema, as it was known, was going through its infancy as even though Griffith's dull visions (unfortunately) were coded and embraced as somewhat groundbreaking and visually satisfying, and the language, which is still being explored (thankfully), was not yet formed as a doctrine that would make cinema what it is today and what it has been for quite a long time.In the sense that Eisenstein popularized a concept we know as montage, the most interesting thing in this film's nature is the core, as it is scintillatingly different from Griffith's The Birth of a Nation, a film it is too often compared to; Griffith had no real eye for contemplative cinema, and it might be a sheer coincidence that it was Tarkovsky who fought against the nature of cinema as artificially dead and as a continuation of literature, in a form or another, trying to make it more of a tool of natural pensiveness, and Eisenstein had that eye, too, and perhaps his later work proves it even better than this film, which is, of course, a rather early work (as a director his third credited film) and what Eisenstein really did was and the talent he had is really incarnated in his Ivan Groznyj films.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Still has an impact a century later,"It's a good thrill ride that depicts Russia in a nuanced manner, though being made under the thumb of Lenin it's worth questioning how much of this rings true and how much was doctored for dramatisms.

If this film is a steak, the people latching onto it for political point scoring are the maggots crawling over it. Find a more appropriate venue to infest your ideas on, please?Anyway, doctored or not, Battleship Potemkin remains a classic for good reason and even if the sequences after the mutiny on the ship signal a noticeable drop, there's still some pretty awe inspiring shots, like the scenes set at night showing the crew as silhouettes on the lookout. Some of these moments could've probably benefited without that score blaring all the time, but good luck finding silent moments from the silent era unless you stick your device on mute.

Where Nation Appears in Lead...,"While analyzing the historic directors and movies, one cannot ignore the important influence of the Russian productions. Although the films, for the new reality that came with 1917, were a powerful means of revolution propaganda, some productions can boast unique features that could not even be traced back in the Hollywood silent era. The name that constituted a milestone of that period in the Soviet Union was, undoubtedly, Sergei Eisenstein, the sort of ""Russian D.W. Griffith."" He is not only famous for having made movies concerning the distant history, like IVAN THE TERRIBLE or Alexander NEWSKY, but also for having directed the powerful pro-revolutionary production like this one, the silent movie that still overwhelms viewers in a unique way.The most striking feature that BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN can boast are not the revolutionary ideas, which brought quite different things in later history, but the artistically innovative merits of the movie. Foremost, it refers to the use of camera and the stunning images that call viewers' attention in an unforgettable way. Here, there is a special need to mention the iconic moments presenting the inhabitants of Odessa and the powerful, still very dramatic depiction of the Odessa steps tragedy. The faces of the people, the whole tension, the camera close-ups of the growing terror in people's reactions and faces, the focus on fists and teary eyes are particularly believable. They still shock, they still depress, they still create a unique horror in the viewers' perceptions: you see a mother with a dying child, you see people who helplessly and vainly try to beg the robot-like army of slayers for mercy; you see the tramping boots that unemotionally move on and on and a perambulator with a baby sleighing down the steps after the mother has just been shot to death...I admit that this scene touched me most and left a lasting impact in my memory.Another great merit and uniqueness of the film is the fact that it is not any vehicle for some important cast, it does not feature anybody eminent. On the contrary, it is a movie where a nation becomes a hero, where there are people who are at the focus. That makes it a true story of the 1905 uprising and perfectly crafts the developing wrath in equal brothers who struggle against the cruelty and ignorance of their commanders. In that respect, I do not hesitate to say that BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN does a better job than the American top notch production of later years, MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY (surely, the intentions hidden behind are different in case of Eisenstein). It is really the people who fight together (in a propaganda way). There are no single stories, no emphasis on single events but a mutual aim...something very communist, on the one hand, but something that is beautifully executed thanks to Eisenstein's unique handling.Consider, for instance the scene when the rotten meat is given to the sailors - the concrete reason for their radical ""no""...there is a wonderfully logical link with the later question of the commander: ""Who liked the soup?"" Immediately we see the faces of people, the growing rage and the revolutionary ideals brought into real actions. I believe this must have created a very powerful impact in the viewers of that time due to this masterful depiction. The film must have done a convincing job in promoting the new Russian reality. But my aim is not to evaluate difficult paths of history but merely see it as a cinema production, a silent production.And in that respect, I say with honesty and certainty: WELL WORTH SEEING! No important content, no great stars nor terrific performances; yet a significant production of the silent era and a powerful IMAGE that will truly remain in your memory.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Poetic!,"Very few people in the history of the cinema have left an imprint as deep as Sergei M. Eisenstein, Russian director and film theorist whose ideas about montage changed film editing (and film-making itself) forever. As one of the first to discover the potential of the artistic manipulation of film in order to transmit emotions, Eisenstein transformed film editing from simple chronological cuts to a more expressive language. His third movie, ""Bronenosets Potyomkin"" (""Battleship Potemkin"" in English), is definitely his most famous work and the flagship of the montage theory, as it was in this movie where he was able to fully explore the ideas he had developed initially in ""Stachka"" (""Strike), his first feature. Many has been written about ""Battleship Potemkin"", and not without a reason, as this movie lives up to its status of classic like no other.""Battleship Potemkin"" is the dramatization of a real life story, the uprising of the Potemkin's crew against their officers in June 1905. The story begins when in the Potemkin, sailor Grigory Vakulinchuk (Aleksandr Antonov) and his mates discover that the meat destined for their consumption is rotten and filled with maggots. The sailors protest, but the officers state that the meat is in fact in good conditions and that the sailors will have to eat it. These statements increase the rage of the sailors, who that night refuse to eat the rotten meat, defying their superiors in a blatant display of protest. The next day, the Potemkin's officers decide to execute those who defied their orders, and it's at that moment when sailor Vakulinchuk decides to call for a rebellion. The consequences of the Battleship Potemkin uprising will be enormous, and the first place that feels them is the small city of Odessa.While the movie was co-written by Eisenstein and three of his collaborators, ""Battleship Potemkin"" is completely Eisenstein's brainchild, as he devised the movie as an experiment about the effects of his editing technique on the audience. The desired effect was that the audience felt completely identified with the revolutionaries and their cause, while at the same time had feelings of antipathy and rejection to the czar's army, arguably the film's ""villians"". While this may sound like a very simplistic approach to the story, it is really the perfect devise to Eisenstein's highly visual style of film-making, as what matters in the film are not the characters, but the events happening. Despite being a fictional account of the real life event, Eisenstein's script captures the spirit of the uprising and the ideologies behind it (after all, it was conceived as revolutionary propaganda) in a quite powerful way.Obviously, Eisenstein's direction is the true star of the movie, as he shows his mastery, not only of montage, but also of cinematography (by Eduard Tisse and Vladimir Popov) and overall visual composition, which give the movie a nearly poetic majesty. It is often said that movies with good narrative should be able to tell its story without sound, and ""Battleship Potemkin"" proves that statement true with its near perfect visual storytelling that without problems (and with very few inter-titles) transmits its message to the audience. Another interesting trait of the film is how despite the manipulative montage, it feels incredibly realistic, almost as if it was a documentary on the subject. The now legendary Odessa Steps sequence, a monumental achievement in film-making, is done in a tremendously realistic fashion that, as critic Roger Ebert points out, ""is often referred to as if it really happened"".To achieve this atmosphere of realism, Eisenstein often used untrained people (and even members of his crew) to play basically themselves in his movies, and ""Potemkin"" is not an exception, as to most of the actors on screen this meant their only participation in movies. A notable exception is the man playing the movie's most important role, Aleksandr Antonov, who plays rebel sailor Vakulinchuk. Antonov had his debut in Eisenstein's first movie Dnevnik Glumova, and went on to have a relatively prolific career during the following decades. As Vakulinchuk, his performance is quite powerful and very natural, capturing with ease the traits of the legendary rebel and transforming him into a myth. On a side note, directors Vladimir Barsky and Grigori Aleksandrov (Eisenstein's close collaborator) appear in the movie in the roles of the battleship's evil officers.More than 80 years after its initial release, one can still say that Eisenstein's experiment was an enormous improvement in film editing techniques, and more than that, it was probably the final step to complete the transformation of film into an art form. While the use of film editing to create emotions was of course done with the purpose of using the films as revolutionary propaganda, the use of images and symbolism to create emotions in the audience is hardly objectionable and one could say that it was even necessary for movie to be the expressive art form that is today. Due to all those reasons, ""Battleship Potemkin"" is without a doubt one of the most important movies ever made, and one that even today manage to bring great emotions from its audiences, as its universal message of freedom is certainly more powerful than any political ideology.An obligatory entry in almost every book on the history of cinema, ""Battleship Potemkin"" is a movie that even today, more than 80 years after its conception, keeps being not only a thrilling an entertaining story, but also as fresh and influential as when it was originally released. Some critics may accuse it of being manipulative propaganda, and while they are probably right, in the end, what film is not manipulative? 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,History
Crucial Part of Film History,"Sergei Eisenstein's ""The Battleship Potemkin"" is one of the most important works in film history. Set in 1905 it tells of a mutiny aboard a Russian naval vessel. It is very obviously propaganda but it has a genuine power, which can partly be due to Eisenstein's theories on film editing (or ""montage"") and partly due to the mastery with which the large cast is directed.The most startling sequence is the justifiably famous Odessa Steps massacre sequence, which has been referenced many times since. Here, if nowhere else in the film we see a master film-maker on top form.Admittedly the film is often slow at times at the story-line is quite simplistic, as I said earlier the film is propaganda.

A movie still worth seeing today,"The historical context of ""Battleship Potemkin"" is that the Russian Communist party wanted a movie to commemorate the 20th birthday of the revolution of 1905. This revolution, that coincided with the Russian - Japanese war, led to the Duma parliament, that however turned out to be rather powerless. Only by the october revolution of 1917 was the Czar replaced by the Communists.Athough the revolution of 1905 was not very successful after all, the Communist party saw it as the final rehearsal for the october revolution and found it worth commemorating. Sergei Eisenstein was a logical choice as a director, because with ""Strike"" (1925) he had already proved he good make high quality propaganda.Eisenstein made the following choices regarding his assignment.He focused on the uprising on the battleship Potemkin, which was only one event in the revolution of 1905.Within the Potemkin story he relocated the shooting on the citizens of Odessa to the stairs leading to the harbor. He thought he could enhance the visual effect of the scene in so doing, and he was right. Up to this very day this is one of the most famous scenes in film history.Last but not least Eisenstein refined his technique of symbolic editing.Action oriented editing was known since D. W. Griffith. In for example ""Intolerance"" (1916) he alternated the stories of the hanging of a falsely convicted suspect and the approaching of the one who could prove his innocence. The goal of action oriented editing is raising the suspense.In symbolic editing however two actions that are NOT related are alternated. The goal is to alter the interpretation or the mood with which the spectator looks at the main action. In ""Strike"" Eisenstein employed symbolic editing still in a rather crude way alternating scenes in which the police breaks a strike with the slaughter of a cow. In ""Battleship Potemkin"" his approach has become more refined. The stutue of a lion comes to live and symbolises the awakening of the working class.All in al ""Battleship Potemkin"" is a film still worth seeing today, although the historical value in my opinion slightly exceeds the creative value.",8.0,Anonymous,History
The Odessa Steps Sequence...,"My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠One of the greatest films of the silent era, 'The Battleship Potemkin' is a triumph of phenomenal film-making, and is a significant slice of cinematic history. The highly-exaggerated events of the film (among other things, there was never actually any violent massacre on the Odessa Steps) have so completely engrained themselves in the memory, that we're often uncertain of the true history behind the depicted events.This is a grand achievement.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Phenomenal editing and cinematography!,"The storytelling in this movie is great. The movie has some extremely good editing which make the pace of this movie quite high and some of the sequence's truly exciting. The cinematography is what make this also a visual masterpiece. This movie truly is a milestone in movie making.For a silent movie, there really is some good character development. It really was something that surprised me. Also the acting was very well. In American and German movies from the same time period, the actors were terribly overacting with exaggerated body gestures. The performance's in ""Bronenosets Potyomkin"" all feel way more natural. Because of this all the emotions feel very real and you can actually feel for the characters.The movie is filled with some truly exciting scene's. Some of the action was extremely well done and there were some very tense moments. The Odessa Staircase sequence's of course is a real classic and for a good reason. It really is one of the best executed and most powerful sequence's in movie history.Only small point of critique is that the movie drags on for too long at certain points. Some of the sequence's are simply too long.All in all a literal and figural revolutionary movie that simply is a must see.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,History
Greatest Silent Film Ever?,"A dramatized account of a great Russian naval mutiny and a resulting street demonstration which brought on a police massacre.What can I say about this film? It has earned the rare 10 out of 10 from me. I have now rated over 1600 movies, and maybe five have earned a ten. That puts this film in an elite group, in the top 0.5% It is beautiful, and I have to thank the good people at Kino for that. They keep taking old films and making them like new. Every film they have restored has impressed me. This one even more so... it may be Soviet propaganda, but it is glorious propaganda (and allegedly Charlie Chaplin's favorite film).Oddly, Ivan Butler wrote about this film in his history of horror book. This is not a horror film by any stretch of the imagination, but he mentions it for the ""macabre"" moments. An old woman whose eye is shot out, meat that is crawling with maggots (beating Lucio Fulci by many decades). It is real in its disturbing nature, which means something by 1920s standards.Where does this fit in the history of cinema? It is the odd one out. Germany had some great silent films, as did America. We rarely hear of Russia in this context, and no Russian director is a household name like Buster Keaton or Fritz Lang. But ""Potemkin"" is that rare film that defied the bigger film industries of Hollywood and Ufa... and may be the greatest silent film ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The only redeeming quality is good photography,"There are certain things that are inexcusable in a movie. This film has a sound track that is always set at an impossibly fast tempo, no matter what is happening. There is absolutely no character development. It is repetitive. You will see a couple of sailors climb up a ladder on the ship, and then see that same shot repeated four or five times. This occurs when the sailboats are going to meet the battleship, and when the battleship is entering the fleet. Throughout the whole film there are sections where nothing is happening, (like when the sailboats meet the battleship), and you will be listening to demented carnival music when the camera will cut to an old lady, or a seagull. This film is total crap. I actually felt physical pain sitting through this movie. This is the reason why people won't watch art films. But while art films are beautiful and make you think, this is propagandist drival, filled with symbolism that it would take fifteen autistic children to understand. I felt like gouging out my eyeballs, dropping to my knees, and demanding explanation from a God that would let a film like this be made.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"Questions on the historical  content of ""Potemkin""","Some users are confused about the identity of the armed men walking down the steps in the ""Odessa staircase"" sequence. These men are not Cossacks but regular army troops.The Cossacks arrive at the scene a little later and they are the men on horses slashing at the crowd with their sabers.To experts on Russian history: Correct me on this if I'm wrong.But there are a couple of lines in the movie that apparently no one has commented on. After the takeover of the Potemkin, someone in the crowd on shore says, ""Kill the Jews!"" This is on screen for only a couple of seconds but it is there.How cruelly typical of history, not just in Russia but in so many other countries, to immediately, unthinkingly and instinctively blame Jews for any domestic trouble!Perhaps other parts of the movie are not historically factual but the outcry against the Jews is all too real. Comments, anyone?Also, why can't speakers of English learn to pronounce the name as ""Potyomkin"" instead of as ""Potemkin""?

Possibly the most influential film of all time,"A milestone in cinematic history, 'Bronenosets Potyomkin' is one of the handful of great films out there that richly deserves to be called a classic. It was the picture that made Sergei M. Eisenstein a figurehead of film-making at the time. And today, it is still remembered as the wonderful piece of cinema it always has been.'Potyomkin' is a film that NEEDS to be seen as one entity, not to be picked at. Don't just watch those clip shows where they only present the 'Odessa steps' sequence and then move on to 'Citizen Kane' or 'The Godfather', see it all in it's glorious 75-minute running time to really understand and enjoy it. Don't expect every infinitesimal detail to be perfect though, I mean the acting of the '20s silent era makes 'Scooby Doo' look like a master of understated realism, certain plot points may seem illogical and some of the battle sequences look dated, but it is still an immensely enjoyable movie.The most memorable moments in the film are the mutiny on the battleship, Vakulinchuk's body falling off the ship, the sailor under the tent at the end of the pier, the mother holding her dead child, the baby carriage on the Odessa steps and the lion rising up to roar as further carnage ensues.

"The most important, influential and significant film of the silent era.","Battleship Potemkin is a 1925 silent drama film directed by Sergei Eisenstein and is often considered one of the greatest films of all time for its revolutionary camera work and incredible montage techniques, impressive action sequences and compelling plot of comradeship. The story is told through five acts which goes from an uprising on the Potemkin against the barbaric ship captain and senior officers all the way to Odessa to begin an uprising and leading to one of the most important and at the time shocking scenes in cinematic history- the infamous Odessa steps massacre, where we really see how Eisenstein didn't shy away from graphic and near-disturbing imagery The plot has a distinct and recognisable narrative which is now the backbone and basis of film today, again showing how significant and of great importance it is, with a distinct first, second and third act, all the while telling a phenomenal tale and delivering a hugely satisfying, tense and fantastic ending. The film proves itself over and over again as the story evolves and constantly betters itself throughout, its powerful and at times brutal imagery really pushes and signifies the message. Battleship Potemkin is a shining example of early Soviet film and the most significant motion picture of the silent era, still after all these years remaining one of the all time greats, the film never fails to deliver on its hard-hitting emotional impact, graphic violence, alliance-themed story and ground-breaking, hugely influential film making from a mastermind of the era. Battleship Potemkin is a prime example of a perfect film, with the only nit-picking flaws being in an overly long middle act, with a leads to a temperamental delay on forwarding the plot. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Great movie.,"I expected to watch another tepid, dull, ludicrous, poorly Soviet propaganda film and instead, to my huge surprise, I watched a great movie that contained all the elements that elevate this movie to the level of a great work of art. The story is told simply and straight-forward, has excellent acting and provides a positive portrayal of people who act to protest their mistreatment and assert their rights. It is almost unbelievable that this movie was made under the regime of Joseph Stalin because the style of the movie is distinctly un-Soviet and contains evidence of the kind of creativity not associated with the Stalinist regime. That the movie is so-called silent does not detract from its powerful story; the musical score is a masterpiece. Watch this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Roger Ebert said: ""The Battleship Potemkin"" has been so famous for so long that it is almost impossible to come to it with a fresh eye. It is one of the fundamental landmarks of cinema.

Uprising!!!,"""There is an uprising!""Battleship Potemkin is one of the true masterpieces from the silent film era thanks to the innovative editing techniques used by director Sergei Eisenstein. He took the basic principles of continuous editing that D.W. Griffith had used a decade earlier and revolutionized film with his now famous montages. Battleship Potemkin has brilliant montages and by combining these different shots together an entire new meaning emerges. This is one of those rare silent films that not only can be appreciated for the important role it played in the revolution of cinema, but it also happens to be very entertaining on its own. The action scenes were beautifully shot and edited together to stir an even greater emotional impact. Of course, the film isn't without its flaws because being the political film it is (Communist propaganda), its leftist message is heavy handed. The sailors and workers are presented as the saints, while the tsarists are demonized. No matter if you agree or not with the message of the film, there is no denying that this movie is worth watching thanks to Eisenstein's technical achievements and some iconic scenes that continue to influence the way we view cinema today.The screenplay commemorating the uprising of 1905 in Russia was written by Nina Agadzhanova. The story focuses on the crew of the Battleship Potemkin who were being treated poorly by their commanders. One of the sailors, Vokulinchuk (Alexander Antonov), decides it's time for them to stand up like the rest of the nation has against this oppressive government. The next day, the crew refuses to eat the rotten meat served for them and begin a protest which leads to a violent riot. The sailors try to ignite the revolution by raising a red flag near their home port, but when Vokulinchuk is violently killed the people of Odessa become outraged. Things get out of control for the Tsar regime who violently kill hundreds of innocent people on the Odessa Steps, which only ignites more indignation from the rest of the protesters. They have reached a point of no return and there is no stopping the revolution now.The climactic and most memorable action scene takes place during the middle of the film in the Odessa Steps where Eisenstein brilliantly uses rhythmic editing to build the suspense. This scene has become iconic and many directors have payed homage to it. These montages were a perfect fit for propagandistic purposes because they stirred powerful emotions and could easily manipulate the audience. That is why some directors prefer using long takes instead of montages, but there is no denying that Eisenstein's visionary way of directing has influenced cinema today. I appreciated this film very much, but I also enjoyed it and was entertained throughout its short running time. There are also some beautiful shots in Potemkin so a lot of credit has to be given to cinematographer Eduard Tisse. This is a must see film for all the technical achievements involved, and you will be surprised at how well Eisenstein put together those scenes to leave audiences at the edge of their seats.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Revolutionary And Lyrical,"Sometime ago, Russia was a safe place for aristocrats but at the beginning of the last century things went from bad to worse and the aristocracy had to leave their country and go to more secure and warm places in order to maintain their integrity ( physical and economic ).This German count remembers pretty well traveling to the city of Odessa during those times exactly when things were changing. Herr Graf personally witnessed how rude the Russian navy sailors can be if they are forced to eat rotten food ( they should have considered themselves lucky in comparison to this German count's servants who are nourished only on bread and water ) or how complicated it is to sail aboard an aristocratic yacht in the Russian seas because they are full of dangerous battleships , not to mention trying to walk about the Odessa streets, crowded with people who must be moved out of the way by the Tsarist soldiers in order to put order in those streets.Times have changes since then, certainly, but there is something that it is intact, that maintains the same spirit in Odessa: the magnificent, the masterful, the great and superb film direction of Herr Sergei M. Eisenstein in ""Bronenosets Potyomkin"".It is not necessary to say to much about this unique silent film masterpiece, a film than any longhaired youngster who wants to be irremediably captured by the power and fascination of silent films must-see ( and their elders revisit) because this oeuvre is a stunning film exercise . It's inventive film narrative is full of symbolism, metaphors, beautiful and suggestive shots, excellent montage and at the same time it revolutionary and lyrical. Of course, one must not overlook the Odessa stairs scene, one of the most famous and fundamental sequences in the history of cinema and one that can still make audiences gasp for breath ( not a complicated matter for this German count due to his asthma ).The film virtues of ""Bronenosets Potyomkin"" can be appreciated even more today thanks to a restored and uncensored version ( censorship was a constant tragedy during Herr Eisenstein career ) of the film that the German-frenchified TV. Channel ""ARTE"" recently showed. This includes an introduction written by Herr Trotsky ( obviously eliminated afterwards ) in addition to some other shots that were cut.And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must take by storm the Winter Palace.Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,History

outdated and obsolete,"Silent films were very limited in what they could do. Technically they are so far behind modern films that most of them are hard to watch. Some will say I have to watch this film and consider the time period it was made it.Trying to take the time period into account, even then the film falls short. Let's set aside for a moment that this is propaganda and should already be scolded just for that.A silent film, much more than even modern films, should show it's story, not tell. This film completely misses the mark on that aspect. Since it's not able to show you the story sufficiently, it's going to tell you with a lot of text boards. If it's not possible to tell this story with a minimum of text than film isn't the right medium for it. The story is very very simple though so it should have been able to tell it's story much more efficiently.The same can be said about other aspects. At 74 minutes it's not long. But it could have been told in at least half that time. The whole film is just incredibly slow and has to make the same point over and over again. It's the equivalent of modern Hollywood movies that, more often than not, underestimates their audience and treats them like idiots.In the first part of the film we see the events leading up to the mutiny. The sailors complain about the rotten food they have to eat. This point could have been made in a few easy scenes, a couple of minutes at most. Yet, it takes almost 15 minutes to drive it's point home. That's all you need to know really because that describes the whole film.This film is in no way shape or form a piece of cinema history that should be cherished. Nothing about it is relevant today and honestly, I don't believe it was anything to write home about in 1925 either. As far as I'm concerned this whole fiasco should be buried and forgotten.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Resonant Classic of Silent Era!!,"This movie, I must say, exceeded all my expectations that I had developed after reading and listening so much about it from critics and reviewers. I am once again very glad to have tried this silent era classic (other being 'Man with a Movie Camera' another gem). The movie is about the mutiny in the ship Potemkin that in turn grew and reached the lands and probably played some part in Russian Revolution. The movie may not be politically correct and some scenes may have got the facts wrong but nonetheless to watch it as a neutral viewer and cinema lover satisfies me to great extent.The movie starts with the sailors protesting at having to eat rotten meat and then depicts the sailor's mutiny against the officers and in the process sailors leader gets killed. The leader body is then brought to the land (Odessa) where as the news spread of his bravery and the mutiny on the ship, huge crowd draws to pay their respect and mourn on his death. As the demonstration increase on the Odessa Steps, Tsar Soldiers massacre the crowd (apparently this is fiction) and then finally we see other forces (squadron) joining battleship sailors in their revolution. One of the finest and famous scenes in the movie is in the Odessa Steps when a child is killed by the soldiers and crowd runs all over him and then his mother holds her sons dead body and goes to the soldiers where even she is fired at and dies eventually. Other heart wrenching scene is when a child on a crib falls down the stairs after the baby's mother is killed. There are other scenes too which are really good and well handled both visual and emotion wise. Now I know why Eisenstein is regarded as one of the greatest directors of all time because of his revolutionary vision and work in Cinema.I would rate this movie 9/10, the only reason being the movie kind of slips in the last 5 minutes or so where it succeeds in creating good tension between Battleship and Squadron but then it ends little too soon, I was little disappointed then and probably one or two more scene/detail on that would have been great. Other than that I would definitely call it ""One of the Great Masterpiece of Cinema"".I would strongly recommend this to anyone who is interested in watching silent era movies.",9.0,Anonymous,History

A Classic Cinematic Magnum Opus on the legendary tale of Russian Revolution.,"Battleship Potemkin (1925) :
Brief Review -A Classic Cinematic Magnum Opus on the legendary tale of Russian Revolution. There could have been nothing more inspiring than this film if i was born in that era when i could see this film in a theatre. Russian Cinema at it's silent best shows the world that how to break the silence on Revolutionary Films. Battleship Potemkin is inspired by true events hence the dramatic portion is highly acceptable. Wait, No, i think it's groundbreaking and trend-setting considering the era it released. In the midst of the Russian Revolution of 1905, the crew of the battleship Potemkin mutiny against the brutal, tyrannical regime of the vessel's officers. All those historical events are thunderous already, but when it comes to the realisation that it was all put on screen in Silent Cinema era then all speculations and complaints just vanish. Russian Revolution has been used many times in World Cinema but never like this, never before and never after. When people call Battleship Potemkin as ""The Most Influential Propaganda Film Ever"", you can't just deny it but not resist smiling. How many films in 20s decade tried to bring Great stories on screen with huge canvas? We have few countable as same as fingers on our right hand and Battleship Potemkin is one of those rare Gem. It is inspiring, it is engaging, it is vibrating, it is visually stunning, it is technically ahead of time, it is overall a Magnum Opus in outstanding Cinematic manners. There is hardly anything wrong in the film, almost nothing. But there is everything right about it. From storytelling to conviction to visuals to iconic scene to direction to final outcome. Goosebumps, that's all what i had throughout the film. Rest, as a cinematic experience it goes beyond my cinematic knowledge and expectations i had from any film released in mid 20s.

They are given the poorest quality of meat which turns out to be the last straw and the sailors rebel against their officers and take control of the boat. This inspires their civilian counterparts also and the citizens of Odessa join the sailors against the Tsar. There is retaliation by the Tsar which sets the stage for a tense climax. The movie is technically brilliant and is a great indicator of the sheer genius of Eisenstein.The scenes of rebellion and the retaliation by Tsarist forces are shot beautifully.

Please Skip Me,"It's pretty hard to pull off any story no matter what the medium it is being told in. But Battleship Potemkin completely fails at this attempt. So I would suggest you go spend your time watching some other more interesting black and white movie that is more interesting and more historically accurate than this poor excuse of a movie.The camera angles are not so bad. But If you have great aesthetics but no creative content to keep the audience lost in your story then all of it goes to waist. Obviously the makers of this movie were not worried about this. They just wanted to make a statement against something something they didn't approve of but they didn't do a very good job of it.You could tell they put forth a good amount of effort into this movie with all the extras and the props. This all of course didn't pay off in the long run. They ended up just making an expensive movie that had no lasting effect. I think the only reason I saw it in my film history class is because it is a Russian movie and he wanted us to see an example of something that wasn't completely controlled by the government when it was produced. Which is good because i wouldn't want to watch over an hour of that brainwashing communist crap. The thing is that they were trying to hard to make this elaborate movie that they put no depth into it. I literally sat there at the end of the movie saying, ""Oooooookaaaaaay? Why did I just watch that?""The music was okay but nothing I would oggle over. I found this movie so bad that it was slightly humorous. But I don't think it was the director's purpose to be funny.

Stillness and movement in a soviet propaganda,"Eisenstein truly is a master of timeless visuals, greatly combining movement and stillness in his work.

"Two intensely memorable moments from the film strike you with such a crashing force, you cower in your seat in disbelief of the horror you're witnessing in the film.","Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin has two intensely memorable moments; the first one surges when the captain of 'Potemkin' (a battleship) orders his loyal officers to execute the mutinous sailors who are covered in tarpaulin, which instantly took me to the horrifying image of the shrouded Abu-Ghraib prisoners. The second one erupts when the Tsarist army marches down Odessa steps as Cossacks attack the revolting civilians during the famous 'Odessa Sequence'. These two sequences strike with such a crashing force not only because they are expertly edited by director Sergei Eisenstein, who rapidly cuts his camera across the various forces in action in a way that keeps one's heart racing throughout, but also because the scenes are supplemented with astoundingly evocative background score by Edmund Meisel. The images terrify at times because they're so direct, such as the close up shot of a baby getting trampled by fleeing crowd during the Odessa massacre. You cower in your seat as though you're the one being attacked, and you sit with the same expression the characters in the film have because you can't believe what you're witnessing. That's the impact Battleship Potemkin had on me in 2013 so you can imagine how deeply it would've influenced movie-goers in 1925, when the film actually released.Eisenstein's take on the 1905 incident in Russia where the crew of 'Potemkin', a battleship, mutinied against the dictatorial regime of their Tsarist officers, is partly subjective. He deliberately chose not include the outcome of the mutiny in order to present his film as a celebratory instance for the mutineers. He has included a fictitious massacre sequence that's become the most famous scene in the movie – the Odessa massacre, which never occurred. He opens the film with repeated shots of waves crashing on rocks and then takes us to the Potemkin ship, where an officer inspecting the sleeping crew unfairly vents his anger on a young member. The officer is angry because he finds it difficult to make his way through the room filled with sailors, who are huddled in a small room and given little space to sleep. As the other sailors console the weeping sailor (yes, Russians men do weep easily. Know it because I've read Tolstoy), Vakulinchuk, an older sailor incenses his crew to fight back the officers.The next day, there's a commotion on the ship as the crew complaints that their meat is rotten with crawling worms visible. An officer's response – 'These aren't worms. They are maggots. Just clean them and they're fine' (not quoting verbatim so don't bother correcting). This kind of cruel indifference leads to further non-cooperation from the crew, who refuses to finish their soup. For this minor reason, the captain willfully orders for their execution until the soldiers fight back. The spirit of their revolt further manifests in the people of Odessa, who no longer are tolerant against Tsarist oppression. Eisenstein knows the facts but he can't put across his intended message without some artistic tweaking, and so he does it without making his changes feel evident. As Roger Ebert said: 'he did it so well that today, the bloodshed on Odessa steps is often referred to as if it really happened'. The bloodshed sequence comes as so shocking that I was taken to the Jallianwalla massacre that actually happened in India; it made me reflect on what it would've felt at such a moment of unbridled horror.Battleship Potemkin works excellently as a film. A similar mutiny-themed film came out in 2012 which many of you may be aware of – Les Miserables. I have a hunch that the editing in the latter film may have been influenced by Battleship Potemkin. I also know why Potemkin works so well now: firstly, it was silent and so broader gestures and highly expressive classical acting was necessary, whereas Les Miserables was an overkill of broad gestures, expressions and singing,singing,singing; secondly, music is solely what drives the movie's expression without characters having to tear their lungs out singing till even music says 'Take a break already!', and thirdly, the characters in Potemkin, despite their gestures, seemed natural and made the scene look as if it was really happening, unlike the artificial Broadway feel in Les Miserables. Masters like Eisenstein and Kurusawa are very judicious in their use of film elements; they know what-to-keep and what-to-leave so the audience is impacted in the best way. And they made movies ages before, so why haven't many newer filmmakers perfected the art yet? You should compulsorily watch Battleship Potemkin for its able to impact you greatly within a quick seventy minutes, something Les Miserables couldn't do in two-and-half chugging hours.more on sashankkini.wordpress.com/‎",9.0,Anonymous,History

I know Kuleshov has developed a technique, the Russian montage, and Battleship Potemkin is prime example of that, but what's the use of this art if it can't explain what it wants to.It has some disturbing visuals, mainly in that highly overrated sequence that was shot on the stairs, and some fights, etc. Violence might be the only thing in it which I didn't see in any of the films from that era.

One of the Most Studied Movies In Film School,"As movies became increasingly popular in the Soviet Union after the 1917 Revolution, its leaders saw cinema as an instructive, informative and mainly propagandist medium rather than just pure entertainment. Consequently, the aesthetics of the USSR's film industry differed from the United States and the Europeans. The Soviets emphasized a different approach, relying on the Lev Kuleshov school of editing. Student Vsevlod Pudovkin's statement, """"The foundation of film art is editing"" encapsulates Kuleshov's standard practices on movies. Taking lessons from those early auteur directors, especially D. W. Griffith, Soviet filmmakers concentrated on the montage (translated from French meaning 'editing') aspect of film. Each edited sequence was designed to complement, contrast or clash with its adjacent ones.Sergei Eisenstein wasn't a regular participant in Kuleshov's classes at the Moscow Film School, but his background in experimental stage productions introduced him to a new way of thinking when he entered the film world. He too felt editing was the glue that advanced a movie's progress. He studied the current montage placements of clips in other Soviet filmmakers' works. He favored edits of collision, conflicts, and contrast. With a body of work of just one movie, Eisenstein was awarded by the Soviet government to direct a film series marking the 20th anniversary of the 1905 Russian Revolution. Screenwriter Nina Agadzhanova provided him with a sweeping script containing several episodes on the conflict.Eisenstein set out to film the ambitious project. But oncoming inclement Russian weather and a tight deadline meant there was no way he could shoot and edit the inclusive eight episodes. So he picked just one, focusing on a ship's mutiny. That movie, December 1925's """"Battleship Potemkin,"" turned out to be one of the most studied and influential movies in cinematic history. Once he settled down to film the ship's scenes in Sevastopol, Crimea, Eisenstein expanded its narrative to incorporate sequences on the grounds in the city of Odessa to show the Czarist troops' inhumanity to its common and vulnerable citizens.Containing five acts, ""Battleship Potemkin"" follows a crew of a Russian Navy ship as the sailors hear reports of revolution on the mainland. Faced with an unyielding captain who ignores the quality of food, laced with maggots, a group on the ship decides to boycott eating the grub. The mutinous members are corralled and are to be killed by a firing squad. But the would-be shooters first refuse to execute them, then they proceed to rebell against the officers on board. The mutineers succeed, but their leader is killed. When his body is taken to Odessa, his death sparks an outrage throughout the city, forcing the Cossack troops loyal to the Czar to quell the populace. One of cinema's most famous sequences takes place as lines of armed soldiers fire upon unarmed fleeing people, including women, children and the handicapped, as they march down the famed Odessa steps.The director was able to produce a profound visual and heart-felt experience as no other film had yet done. As writer Gerald Mast points out, ""So much of the viewer's experience proceeds not from the eyes to the brain but from the eyes to the nerves. Like music, one feels the film as a rhythm, mood, tone and texture in addition to perceiving its concrete images."" ""Battleship Potemkin"" contains so many quick visuals that film teachers have examined the movie frame-by-frame. Each montage sequence is meaningful to the overall concept of Eisenstein's message of oppression, carnage, reactive rebellion and final sympathy.Nations around the world witnessed the power of the movie's message. Some countries' governments were so fearful ""Battleship Potemkin"" could spark a potential revolution they banned it, including France (who didn't allow its release until 1953) and the United Kingdom (prohibiting its exhibition until 1954, and then labeling it X-rated until 1987).Eisenstein's work has been cited by Charlie Chaplin and Billy Wilder as their favorite movie while Orson Welles and director Michael Mann placed it on top of their favorite movies' list. It has been ranked number 24 in a BBC 2018 poll of non-English speaking films, 11th greatest film of all time in Sight & Sounds 2012 critics' poll, and number 3 in Empire's 100 Best Films of the World.

"Fantastic to look at, but...","Over the past couple of years, I've made it my mission to watch many of the most famous films ever made. And while I've greatly enjoyed some of these films, others have struck me as overrated drags.""Battleship Potemkin"" falls somewhere in the middle of the scale. I admire the film for its groundbreaking direction and sequences of extreme suspense and horror. But, on the other hand, much of the film is a little ... dull. Indeed, my girlfriend is now snoozing heavily in the next room, having passed out during the long sequence of the Potemkin approaching the rest of the fleet. (I suspect that I liked the film a little more than she did. Bless.)Now, I should unpack what I mean by ""dull,"" because I hate it when people are imprecise with their criticisms. I quite like a lot of films that can be construed as ""dull"" -- Twilight Samurai, Alphaville, Tokyo Story, and so on. But these films aren't boring to me; they're paced in such a way as to invite contemplation rather than generate excitement. And because I care about the characters in these films, this pacing doesn't bother me at all; indeed, it draws me into the story even more deeply.The trouble with ""Battleship Potemkin"" is that it doesn't have great characters; nor does it really invite you to contemplate anything. At heart, it's an action movie designed to appeal to the most basic of emotions, not your brain. So, in the slow stretches of the film between action segments, ""Potemkin"" sort of grinds down. This problem doesn't spoil the film completely, but it does in my opinion prevent it from being an all-time classic.So why did I give it an ""8""? Because it truly is fascinating to watch. Because the Odessa steps sequence is rightly celebrated (and the imitations aren't as good). Because the propaganda bits are actually sort of interesting. And, of course, it's full of memorable images that are both beautiful and terrifying.And yet, I can't help being a little annoyed at film critics for over-praising films that were groundbreaking for purely technical reasons. Even though film is a largely visual medium, shouldn't we be more invested in plot, characters, and themes than in novel use of cuts/dissolves/montage/etc.? There's more to movies than clever trickery with the camera -- or there should be, anyway.In short, ""Battleship Potemkin"" looks great and is a fascinating piece of film history, but it might not entertain you, and it almost certainly won't enlighten you. I liked it fine, but I can think of quite a few movies I'd rather watch -- many of them foreign, and most of them slow-paced.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Eisenstein's montage,"Eisenstein produced a tense and violent rhythm with his dialectic montage. He passed on a particular perception of history to the audience through his way of editing. Overall the collision approach itself attempts to represent the conflict and collision of history itself, at the same time the technique applied to individual scenes enforce certain emotional response of the audience. His editing technique serves as psychological stimulation rather than a narrative device, allowing him to deliver his political message through emotional sensation to the audience.Let me illustrate a few sequences.In Act I, after a group of sailors refused to eat the maggot-ridden piece of meat, there is a scene of the three sailors washing the dishes. One suddenly realises that the plate he is washing has the hypocritical inscription ""Give us this day our daily bread"". In the next four seconds a montage sequence of nine separate but overlapping shots shows the sailor smashes the plate twice, the first from his right and second from his left, emphasising the violence and angriness of the sailor's action.In Act II there is a sequence of objects on the ship after the sailors under the tarpaulin kneel down. First the priest tapping his palm with his crucifix, then the lifebuoy with the words ""Prince Potemkin Tavrichesky"", then the ship prow with Czarist eagle, lastly a bugler with a bugle. This montage sequence is Eisenstein's expression of emotional time, which extends and suspends the time of thought of Vakulinchuk and the marine squad, and represents the feeling of the elongated fearful moment of the sailors.The opening of Act III is the famous ""fog montage"" sequence. Here Eisenstein puts together a sequence of shots of various aspects of the habour just before dawn: sailing vessels, steamships, gull-covered buoy, surface of the sea, dockside cranes, Vakulinchuk's tent, etc.. The sequence is an example of ""tonal montage"", as Eisenstein suggested. Each shot in the sequence increases luminosity progressively as the sun rise and gradually disperses the fog. It depicts a long night has passed and finally the dawn has been broken, the death of Vakulinchuk has awaken the anger and support of mutiny against czarism.Act IV is the famous ""The Odessa Steps"" that depicts a massacre of the citizens by czarist troops on the steps. The collisions of movements and dramatic graphic patterns in this sequence of shots bring audience huge psychological and emotional impact. The sequence begins with the intertitle ""Suddenly"", instantly followed by a few close up shots of the dark hair of a woman in white with her mouth open who moves so violently, abruptly shocks the audience. These close-up shots are followed by several shots with citizens run down the steps from left to right in a chaotic way. The source of terror is revealed in a following shot from the reverse angle, the top of the steps, showing a horizontal line of troops in white carrying riffles coming after the people on the steps. Another long shot from the bottom of the steps of people running down is inserted here.Throughout the sequence there are several different figures are isolated, one of them is the woman who run with her son. As they are fleeing, her son falls and is trampled by the crowed and died. She gathers his body and walks up against the crowd from right to left across the screen towards the troops with her dead son in her arms. Meanwhile a woman in pince-nez decides to go up to the troops as well. All these individual actions are shown in shots in between shots of people running down the steps. Now two people are moving up, colliding with the direction of the crowd and the troops, while the disorganised and chaotic fashion of the citizens running downwards is colliding with the orderly descending line of troops coming from the top of the steps.The most famous editing sequence in this act is around the young woman and her baby carriage. She is first shown afraid to push the carriage down the steps, then the troops march down and she is shot. Her falls is illustrated in several overlapping cuts. The montage returns to her every few seconds as she sinks lower to the ground. The successive shot is noticeably discontinue from the previous one, as her position is always more upright than her position at the end of the last shot. Her fall is stretched and repeated by editing. Eisenstein again replace the actual linear time with the emotional time, to emphasise the violent and disruptive action of the troops and the powerless and innocence (which is symbolised by the baby carriage) of the people in front of the audience.As she falls to the ground she also loses control and protection power to her carriage and pushes it offscreen, down the steps. Then Eisenstein intercuts between the baby carriage rolling down the steps, the woman in pince-nez, the student with glasses and the crowd slashing by the Cossack at the bottom of the steps rapidly. Towards the end of the sequence the student screams as the carriage overturns, and without a clear ending for the carriage shown on screen it quickly cuts to a Cossack slashes his saber several times in discontinuous close shots, which then rapidly cut to a close up shot of the woman in pince- nez whose shattered glasses blood spurts from a slashed and blinded eye.Last but not least, the famous three shots montage sequence of a sculptured stone lion. The brief sequence consist of three shots of separate stone lions all posed differently in different position: the first is asleep, the second is awakened, and the third is standing up. With the understand of the Kuleshov's effect, Eisenstein put together the shots to give an impression of a sleeping lion awakening and rising up, symbolising Russian people are awakened to fight against Czar.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Possibly The Greatest Movie Of All Time,"Subjective opinions and personal value aside, Battleship Potemkin (Along with Leaving Las Vegas and Casablanca) is what I consider to be the greatest movie of all time and the closest example in the art of filmmaking to perfection. Eisenstein's appreciation for film as a visual medium, his visionary and creative means of using aesthetics rather than words to tell stories, convey themes and invest you in his narratives, is unparalleled by any filmmaker living or dead. Battleship Potekmin is his magnum opus, the crowning achievement of his career and the conclusive legitimization of filmmaking as a true artform beyond mere entertainment.One of my favorite (And often most unsung) aspects of Eisensein's filmography is his talent for casting as a silent director. Despite not turning to professional actors (Or, alternatively, possibly because of it in part), Eisenstein has assembled an unforgettable cast of striking, memorable faces. From ghoulish, hysterical religious zealots to mustached, kind faced supermen, the performers who Eisenstein has chosen for their respective roles fully embody the themes and emotions of the characters they play on screen. No individual is the hero, no one man is made the star; success and emotional triumph depend entirely on cooperation of the collective of good men and women. It's not merely the themes of the film that represent Leftist values, it's the structure of the character development and the filmmaking itself.Much has been spoken of Battleship Potemkin's radical use of montage to magnify the emotional power of its scenes. In my opinion, not nearly enough has been said. His framing of national tragedies through the eyes of the populous, the eyes of a collective, completely forces his audience from the role of bystander to active and compliant participant to the events of the film. This is what filmmaking is all about; sucking us into the world of your movie, sharing the importance of your thematic material through genuine empathy rather than listening to the hollow, recited words of cardboard cutouts telling us how to feel. Battleship Potemkin is one of the most singularly investing films I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing despite dialogue that may as well be absent from the picture entirely. Furthermore, Eisenstein's use of montage on its own is already a breathtaking and revolutionary filmmaking technique, but interweaving it with the themes of societal importance of the collective is a stroke of genius. Through this narrative decision, Sergei speaks to how the journeys and arcs of societies and communities themselves, not individuals, are what shape history. These are the narratives that benefit our world culture's the greatest, that show the legitimacy and importance of filmmaking to shaping the ideals and values of not just cult followings or a general ""film buff"" consensus, but entire nations.Compared to its contemporaries released around the same time, Battleship Potemkin is a shockingly violent and brutal film. From the brutal murder of a protective and sheltering mother to the slaughtering of innocent civilians by mass to the abandonment (And possible death) of an innocent baby, Potemkin is a far cry from the ""bread and circus"" criticisms that could apply to many films of the era. This is brutal, harsh and dark filmmaking, but without any of the misplaced and childish ""nihilism"" displayed from ""artists"" in the filmmaking industry of future years. Unlike his unsuccessful imitators, Eisenstein uses violence out of a place of personal concern and dread. There is nothing artistic or stylized about his depiction, it's as mean and blunt and to the point as possible. Most of the best scenes of violence in film come from a place of rage, a place of impassioned and challenged personal ethics; every act of violence in Battleship Potemkin is treated for the tragedy it is, never forgetting the all-too important human element behind it. The images of helpless and vulnerable civilians futilely begging for their lives to hordes of Czarist Police, the shot of a woman's face being frozen in Horror as everything she ever was, everything she ever will be, ends at the sword of a corrupt soldier, are images of anger. Images that incite passion and fury. Eisenstein understood the power of violence in movies and uses it masterfully in Potemkin, with very minimal dialogue no less. Other smaller scenes like the monocle of the ship's surgeon (The very one used to unscrupulously validate the ethicacy of feeding sailors rotten and spoiled meat) dangling from the rigging after being tossed off of the boat, shots like the symbolic ""shooting of the lion"" representing the fall of lazy, unethical and monstrous tyrants, are just as staying in my memory as the infamous Odessa Steps for which the film is so heavily praised for.It's not merely the images of brutal violence that give poignancy to the visual storytelling of Potemkin. The beginning imagery of a plate breaking with the words ""Give Us Your Daily Bread"" printed on it, as well as the synchronized swinging of the sailors hammocks with that of the galleys chains are wonderful and intensely subtle examples of foreshadowing that are a prime example of ""show, don't tell"" storytelling. (Take note, Michael Daugherty and Danny McBride)Battleship Potemkin is a treasure. It is a triumph. It may very well be the best film of all time and anyone with a passion for the visual nature of storytelling, let alone film, owes it to themselves to watch it at least once. You're welcome in advance.",10.0,Anonymous,History
I see why people think this is such a masterpiece,"I really find it hard to describe Battleship Potemkin because it's just a film that just wows you over before you can even stop to think about it, a technical masterpiece with a genuinely thrilling plot. The story takes place in June of 1905 on the battleship well Potemkin, we see the crew of the ship are not so happy and they are revolted by the standards they have and so they stick up for themselves and when fellow crew members are nearly killed by their own officers, it seems quite the time for the crew to get up and fight. It is a dramatized version of true events but this movie really pumps up the workers as complete heroes, I mean this movie is Soviet propaganda through and through, but it's superbly well made even if it is.The man behind this perfectly crafted motion picture is Sergei Eisenstein who directs this in a way which even when it's going very slow still manages to either be thrilling or throw in some kind of thing to make it so amazing. I think what he also does is create a movie that isn't just for critics to feast their eyes on, this can be enjoyed by anyone I swear and it's actually a genuinely exciting kind of movie, although I would always watch a few silent movies beforehand so that you get the right feel of this. What Eisenstein also does is bring in all the crafts that make up a film and creates an art piece, one that's cameras are perfectly working, editing is finely tuned, dialogue (even for a silent movie) is great and then utilises production design especially in the famous ""Odessa Steps"" scene where the outfits and the general look of the scene looks amazing.This is so often placed on the lists that people compile with the greatest movies and for good reason, the reasons become even more so when you consider this was made in 1925 and it is silent, but you never truly think about that and this doesn't seem to have aged at all, in fact other than the cast the only expired thing is the Soviet Union. Yet again it is Eisenstein who makes it ageless, I felt he just knew what he wanted and did it, made a film that although is made for a certain political position, can still entertain no matter what your views on politics.I feel that again those steps are like come on, I mean those boots are just a brilliant cinematic piece. The scene is one that is thrilling yet also oddly touching with a little added darkness (well OK make that quite a bit). The choreography of the entire scene is marvellous too with the enormous cast to run and fall down it not only makes it incredible to see but you'd think also really dangerous! Don't watch this just for this scene I mean this has sublime scenes elsewhere, take for example the ending which of course I won't spoil but when you think one thing it does something else and builds you up until you are really excited to see what happens next.I think that if you consider this not your kind of film then think again, this isn't a movie that should only be shown in history classes or film studying lectures, it's a movie that should be seen because it is entertaining but also technically a film of flawless dimensions. Yes feast in what Soviet cinema has to offer and maybe you might like it quite a bit, in fact you might even be accustomed to raising a red flag above your house even if the neighbour calls you a commie.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Artistic example of Film Photography as well as Socialist Realism,"The photography and editing of the movie is exceptional for the time period. Eisenstein builds upon each scene of the movie leading to the the sailor's revolt and the massacre at the town. As much as the movie is a high point in the cinema, it is also an example of SZocialist Realism. by 1925 the Soviet government actively used the arts, including film, as a means to spread the message of the revolution. Eisensteins portrayal of the revolt on the Battleship Potempkin offers the viewer insight into the message of the Soviet elite. Marxist theory and perspectives of class struggle are demonstrated as the sailors who represent the oppressed workers and the officers who represent the elite of society. Much of the film demonstrates the communist party message and how film was used as a tool of propaganda.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Fantastic movie,"I normally can't stand silent movies, most of the time I just can't connect to any of the characters and I'm always frustrated by the slow pacing and exaggerated ""acting"" characterized by the period. Battleship Potemkin, however, really struck a chord with me.The cinematography was consistently fantastic, and the story was simple and elegant. I also found eisenstein's use of non professional actors to be an incredibly smart move. Instead of giving the usual over-the top theatrical performances of the typical stage turned film actors of the time, they gave realistic, natural performances that I found were much easier to relate to than someone flailing their arms in the air to show that hey are angry.Obviously, the editing was near perfection. It's amazing to see just how far ahead of it's time this movie was as far as editing goes. Whether it was the film's complex juxtaposition of images (like the priest during the uprising or cutting from the doctor being thrown overboard to the rotten meat) that form a whole greater than the sum of it's parts, or the legendary Odessa steps sequence, the editing is never short of spellbinding.

No point gilding the lily - it's first-rate cinema.,"I'm not going to attempt to find loads of cinematic superlatives about this. It's just a great film that depicts the epitome of cruelty, indifference and kindred spirit at sea in spades. The crew of this powerful warship are treated little better than prisoners in a gulag. When the ship's doctor insists that their daily meat ration (which could ""jump into the water by itself"") is safe to eat, a few of them decide to take a stance. Their officer humiliates them, and when they refuse to back down he corners them on deck and orders them shot. This proves the flashpoint for his crewmen who proceed to seize the ship and sail to Odessa where they turn the guns on the army headquarters in the city and the conflagration grows. Will others join them, or will the status quo be returned and their ship destroyed...? Historians have already told us the answers to most of the factual questions, so it's not really about what happens - it is the magnificently poignant and suspenseful fashion in which Eisenstein paces the film. Clearly he has an agenda, his depictions are not exactly even handed - particularly the soldiers in the town dealing with the civilian population, but that doesn't overwhelm the overall sentiment of the sailors rebelling for just reasons, for decent treatment and for a degree of respect that was certainly lacking from their officers. The production itself is superb, the camerawork has an intensity that makes you feel as if you are actually on the boat at times. I'm sure there are more analytical reviews of this film to be had - but I think it is just a wonderful example of a man at the top of his game making an exciting film that delivers entertainment and a bit of thought-provocation in equal measure, at the same time.",8.0,Anonymous,History
-,"Almost a century old by now, this is undoubtedly still an amazing piece of cinema through and through, with astounding music and an extremely dynamic filming and cinematography, that allows for a more dramatic telling of an already timeless piece of storytelling.The glasses of the doctor, dangling when he's thrown overboard, intercuted with the worms he shall feed while down under; or the feet of one of the mutineers when he steps on the piano, and we hear a few piano notes swell, are only two of the earlier examples where the still camera allows for the occasional close-up to enhance a dramatic telling of this story in such simple terms.But apart from the amazing vistas on the city on the third act, where the director takes advantage of the lighting and architecture of the scene to expose the almost breathtaking perspectives on the large crowds, it is indeed the Act IV that includes the most shocking and impressive scenes.
Particularly, when you witness a kid being attacked and stomped on the Odessa steps, and watch the mother going against the incoming troops' shadows with the son in her arms, you can't manage to not stay with that shot engraved in your mind.When the act ends, as the battleship fires on the theatre, and you see the consecutive shots on the lions' statues, as if waking up in face of the occurring events, you just manage to stay wowed. Even without knowing first hand all that Eisenstein achieved and invented with this film, you can still marvel in all the iconic shots that stay with you far from its end, even recognising the clear inspiration (rather, origin) for The Untouchables most famous scene, of the baby cart falling down the steps.And even the final act, what appears an overly long chase scene antedating what you imagine to be a violent final confrontation, ends up being a satisfying end to a simple tale on a piece of History that becomes even more believable in this staging.",10.0,Anonymous,History

I can't believe this film was made almost a century ago.,"'Battleship Potemkin' is set during the Russian Revolution of 1905. After days at sea, the meat have gone rotten and the sailors refuse to eat. The ship's doctor tells the sailors the meat can simply be washed clean and is safe to eat.When the sailors refuse to eat the meat or borscht made by the chef, the Captain orders the sailors to be shot in front of a firing squad. However, Vakulinchuk - leader of the rebels - pleads for the sailors not be executed. Soon after, the sailors overpower the officers and take control of the ship. Sadly, Vakulinchuk is killed in the process.When Vakulinchuk's body is brought to shore, his death sparks a rebellion. These scenes in town are absolutely remarkable, with thousands of extras being used. The scenes on the steps were absolutely fantastic. This must have been quite an undertaking back in 1925, and to this day it is jaw-dropping to see. Nowadays, they can simply use CGI, but back in the day this off course was not possible.

Regardless of your thoughts on the propaganda message, the technique is so sublime that the most famous section, the Odessa Steps sequence, has been ""quoted"" into countless movies and it is one of the classic and most influential in the history of cinema.One for all, the sequence in The Untouchable which is just as brilliant and memorable, enhanced by the slow motion, own everything to Odessa.

The movie's greatness doesn't lie only in the overwhelming montage technique, much more compelling in Eisenstein's earlier feature, Stachka. Potemkin is one of the best movies of the twenties because the technical brilliance present in Stachka has been completely assimilated by the director who now uses that technique proficiently not in an obtrusive way. From this perspective this movie looks more like The Magnificent Ambersons as compared to Kane. The technique in Potemkin is much more directed to achieving a certain artistic goal instead of simple bravado as it was the case with many shots from Stachka. In the latter movie we have some up-side down shots with mirrors that have little significance in the whole movie. In Potemkin every shot has a meaning in the larger frame of the whole film. The fact that Eisenstein controlled and perfectly balanced all the constitutive elements of his movie is what entitles him to the title of great director. He was much more than the improver of montage theory which he understood here and in the later Alexander Nevsky to function in a more subtle manner, very modern at that in the sense that the viewer should not be conscious that the cinema is ""playing tricks"". At its best Potemkin manages to draw the viewer in the medium so much that its ""lesson"" is much more compelling on an emotional level than that in Stachka. Take for instance the idea of child slaughtering. In Stachka we have a soldier dropping a child from a height. In Potemkin we have much more subtle technique where we are forced to feel the drama by placing ourselves in the same position as the tumbling unfaltering cart with the child in it. This is a technique striving for dramatic realism and it is much more compelling than a simple montage. It is an example of many dramatic shots that remain very fresh on a very emotional level until today.That Potemkin is a very modern movie is obvious from the way the soundtrack serves the images; I am talking about the original Shostakovich soundtrack. One of the most compelling and dramatic shots of the film is the montage at the beginning with the images of breaking waves perfectly juxtaposed with the music in a very expressionist manner almost like a shout of outrage.Much more than Stachka this movie shows us not only a developed collective character but the individual is much more obvious. The heroic element concentrated in a person as in Nevsky is not yet here but Potemkin shows some of the ideas that will eventually mark a break between Eisenstein and his Soviet patrons. Class struggle does not have the same humorous touch we see in Stachka, Potemkin has a more dramatic edge and I cannot remember a moment when I could laugh. This may be because the director understood that this film has a much deeper impact on the viewer with the Odessa steps episode for instance so any humor could have been damaging.For what I know the cut I saw, something near 74 minutes is not the ""original cut"". I have no idea what the alleged cut material consisted in but I cannot imagine this movie being more complete than it already is. And the ending, rather anticlimactic is not as some have said flawed but actually very compelling. Eisenstein's idea was that the Revolution is something, as Lenin states in the motto at the beginning, fair and legitimate so that everyone will ""see the light"" and take the right decision when it comes to it. The fact that the other ships join the mutineers is something natural seeing as they were in the same ""tight spot"" under the tsarist regime.And as a final comment: take the ""propaganda"" from this movie i.e. Lenin's motto and you get one of the most humane cries for freedom ever depicted in a film. What else is Potemkin if not a beautiful portrayal of man's endless and passionate struggle to escape slavery? I have always been impressed that unlike Riefenstahl's ""documentaries"" Eisenstein can be very easily dissociated from the Communist doctrine in a variant of which he deeply believed. As an artist he had such an integrity that he strived to put on screen what he believed was right. Up to some point he thought that his artistic ideals coincided with the Party doctrine. That he understood his art as serving a social purpose is something worth respecting, he wanted to change the world through art, to make people better. History has proved Eisenstein and his kin were fools whose ideals have been thwarted by the most abject interests of the Party. But there is no doubt at least for me that as a true artist (that is more than a technical wizard) Eisenstein was honest, much more so than his American counterpart Griffith. Both Griffith and Eisenstein need to be placed in their culture to assimilate their message today. It is not their fault that history proved them wrong, it is a simple fact of life.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Mutiny on a Russian battleship 1905 with consequences both tragic and heroic,"Of course it is still impressing after almost a hundred years, for its amazing sense of details, its tremendously dramatic impact, its highly strung pathos and its wonderful cinematography all through, but still there is room for some objections. It can't be helped, but it is tendentious, it glories in Soviet nationalism with the individual being effaced in the movement of the masses, it even says so in the text, and it is somewhat hysterical in its constant muddle of crowds amassing and running together in fanatic frenzy, which reminds me of the fanatic Christians massing together to massacre the poor Hypatia in the Agora film. It's a film about crowds for the masses, where individualism is completely run over and abolished, which it can't be for human reasons. It's a great film but with tendencies that must bring misgivings, as a prelude to the age of totalitarianism under Stalin and others.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Propaganda at its best,"N. F. Agadzhanova-Shutko wrote Battleship Potemkin's script not only as a revolutionary propaganda film, but also as a vehicle for Sergei Eisenstein's testing of his theories of montage. Eisenstein then edited the film in such a way as to generate the utmost emotional reaction, so that the viewer would feel empathy and compassion for the defiant sailors and extreme dislike for their pitiless overlords. In the style of most propaganda, the characterization is clear-cut and uncomplicated, so that the audience can unmistakably tell with whom they should identify. The point is, Eisenstein's theory of montage has been diluted and adulterated since then to the point where it's either completely ignored or thought of as kindergarten know-how. Film-making has now evolved quite a lot for the Battleship to have any kind of strong effect on us, non-contemporary. The dialogue in the inter-titles feels painfully scripted. The cards that don't represent dialogue are so self-explanatory that they make the images futile and redundant: ""Bowl of soup"" (wow). One shot juxtaposed with another doesn't necessarily say it all. One has to direct the forces within a shot for a cut to serve any purpose. The picture's legendary moment is, of course, the scene of the slaughter of civilians on the Odessa Steps, in which soldiers shoot a mother who is pushing a baby in a carriage, and it rolls down the steps in the midst of the escaping mass. And this image has since been imitated in The Untouchables, Brazil, The Godfather, just to name a few. Anyway, it's important to note that the genius of the director surpassed the original quality of the script, building a classic.",9.0,Anonymous,History

the story of the mutiny on board battleship Potemkin at the port of Odessa,"This 1925 film narrates the story of the mutiny on board battleship Potemkin at the port of Odessa. The movie celebrated the 20th anniversary of the uprising of 1905, which was seen as a direct precursor to the October Revolution of 1917. Following his montage theory, Eisenstein plays with scenes, their duration and the way they combine to emphasize his message, besides he uses different camera shot angles and revolutionary illumination techniques. The ""Odessa Steps"" sequence in Potemkin is one of the most famous in the history of cinema. The baby carriage coming loose down the steps after its mother has been shot was later recreated in Brian d' Palma's The Untouchables.

The sea is rough : a prelude to revolt,"The sea is rough : the natural image is a prelude to revolt. On the battleship Potemkin the multitude of men on deck finds worms in the rotten meat.
The sailors refuse to shoot who did not want to eat the rotten meat.
In a long field on the deck of the ship there is a revolt against the officers. In the assembly there are subversive shots like the detail of the lower limbs that rise and fall on the stairs.
A sailor,Vakulinchuk, that he was the first to invoke the revolt, is shot by an officer, remains hanging on a rope and a group of officers goes to rescue him. A group of sailors approaches Odessa, bringing even the dying sailor with the inscription ""killed for a plate of soup"".
The inhabitants of Odessa run down the stairs to see the dead sailor. A very long field with a frame from the top
connects the flow of people on the stairs with the waves of the sea. A young man in a middle field reads a letter that incites the revolt to avenge the sailor and alternates in the assembling moved close-ups. With the motto ""All for one and one for all"" collective despair becomes union.
In a very long field the crowd of people goes under and over a bridge. Cossacks arrive and shoot men, women and children on the crowd. An alternate montage puts the whole figure of a dead child and the painful first floor of the mother into suffering and tremendous eye contact while the child is trampled.
The mother goes to meet the Cossacks with her dead son in her arms, recalling the image of the piety of the Madonna with Christ but she is also shot. Another mother is killed and the caravan with the little child goes down the stairs.
The city of Odessa is bombed by Potemkin, which tries to stop the massacre. In the darkness the armored Potemkin advances towards a ship sent by the tsar and get ready for the fight.

Prepare yourselves for a mutiny...,"*THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS... OR MAYBE NOT.

Perhaps the greatest silent film,"Battleship Potemkin is a silent film by Sergei Eisenstein. It gives a historically dramatized account of the battleship Potemkin, where the crew revolts against the captains. This is Soviet propaganda without a doubt, which gives it an interesting historical perspective. It mainly focuses on the importance of revolution, brutality of the Tsar, and individual expense for the greater good. All these strong themes make the film easy to focus on, even for modern audiences.The acting is good, although not outstanding. The main captain, doctor, and priest make an infamous representation of cold leadership. The captains of the ship are contrasted with the crew by their black jacket. This makes it instantly recognizable which side is which. The placement of the people and actions is perfect. Its editing like this that makes it so easy to watch even though the film itself is old. The good planning carries out through the whole film.The most impressive quality is the cinematography. The shots of the water, ship, and building structures are all meticulously done. A very effective image is shown early on, where the ships meat is crawling with maggots. The captain's refusal to provide adequate food for the crew reaches a climax when he plans to execute crew members that did not like the soup. This leads to the first impressive scene: the ships revolt. The action here is comparable with many modern action flicks. Later, the famous scene on the Odessa steps and the conclusion are also shown through phenomenal editing. It is very obvious that this quality is years ahead of its time. Few films are so technically great without the use of color and sound.This might be the greatest silent film in existence. I have yet to see Metropolis, but have seen most other notable silent films. I found Battleship Potemkin to be the easiest to watch out of the bunch. That, along with historical and technical significance, makes this a must see for anyone that loves studying film.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A few thoughts on a widely regarded masterpiece,"NOTE: This is not a conventional review; this is my required response to Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin for my college course Intro to Film & Screen Studies...Cinema, both domestic and foreign, owes a lot to Sergei Eisenstein for creating not only one of the most successful propaganda films with Battleship Potemkin, but one of the most successful examples of montage in history. Eisenstein employs a wide variety of subversive montage styles here, some considered tonal ones that string together a continuous feeling that rubs off on an audience, some for the purpose of continuity and consistency in events, and some for the purpose of putting grandiose, large-scale sequences into a specified perspective, though all significant in their own right.One of the most jarring inclusions of structurally conflicting shots is the famous shot of the statue of the lion, which is shown sleeping, awakening, and rising all in the matter of about two seconds. These static images, when strung together, inspire the kind of momentary shock we, the audience, have upon watching Eisenstein concoct a film so raucous and battle-hungry that it's as if the lion is replicating our personal feelings whilst watching the film. The conflict established is more or less a circumstance of reactionary response to the disobedience of order; order which is constantly affirmed throughout the entire first chapter of the film.Then there's the scene in the second chapter where the passengers aboard Potemkin begin to rebel. Eisenstein utilizes his montage theory to establish the events occurring before zeroing in on specific people fighting and specific blows in a way that shows the conflict between the two parties whilst showing a more concise focus on a large-scale playing field. The effect is unique because it's rare we see a large battle (or even a large battle conducted in a small area) specified so humanly by way of close-ups and intimate shooting techniques that Eisenstein employs that make the sequence so personal.As far as alternative logic goes – where Eisenstein creates some sort of visual poetry or distinction without the use of his beloved montage technique – there's the scene early in the film where one of the captains goes to observe the actions in the bunkers. Eisenstein's camera observes the actions of the captain while interjecting cuts of pots and pans precariously placed atop boards of wood that are strung up and suspended to the room's ceiling. These scenes establish what the captain is looking at and what his environment is composed of in a manner that relates greatly to Kulesov and his own personal effect.Then there are scenes that are more concerned with fleshing out a specific event, rather than encapsulating the horror and the messiness of other events (the uprising aboard the Potemkin and the famous Odessa Steps sequence just to name a few). One scene is the final straw for the workers, of sorts, when they are persuaded to believe that rotting, maggot-ridden meat is okay for consumption, despite being viewed by everybody on board, even the cooks, as otherwise. Eisenstein keeps things grounded more-or-less in a real-time here, allowing his camera to go back and forth between the workers and the captains in a manner that doesn't shortchange or rapidly look for a way out of this event in order to interject other scenes and create a compilation of ""last straws"" for the workers. This scene in particular establishes the logic that Eisenstein uses can be equal parts broadly observant, as seen in his montages, or decidedly focused.In a way, I feel Battleship Potemkin was a film made for the masses to, for once, look introspectively at their situations in Russian and observe the treacherous, unfair living conditions and the willfully oppressive nature of the rich and able. Eisenstein had to combat the fact that most of the commonwealth Russian population was illiterate and unknowing of their own exploitation, which made him make a film like this that, despite being able to be dissected in numerous ways, almost demands a response of any kind. The complete and total disregard for the health and wellbeing of humans should at least warrant some response from people, and Eisenstein's images reflect the horrors of oppression without getting lost in symbolism or any kind of discernible auteurism. His montage elements only add to a film, rather than being stylistic distractions that work to muddle the themes at hand.Starring: Aleksandr Antonov, Vladimir Barksy, and Grigori Aleksandrov. Directed by: Sergei Eisenstein.",9.0,Anonymous,History
My overall opinion of the film is that I loved it.,"My overall opinion of the film is that I loved it. It is a very successful in getting its emotions across and it is that which makes the film brilliant. Even though the film is not perfect it is definitely a film that I will not forget in a hurry. It says a lot for how successful all of the images are that so many people think so highly of ""Battleship Potemkin"", regardless of a narrative that is from time to time hard to follow. This is because the film does not have the best acting talents but it still delivers a hard punch that stays with you. I would say that the Odessa Steps has to be one of the most well known sequences in the history of film. The famous Odessa Steps montage single-handedly reveals equally the excellent industrial talents and an intense understanding of how to deliver a picture that stays with the audience. I would say that the overall techniques used in this film were to make it shocking, just like my first and second film in A2. The images are so striking that the movie's faults are often not so obvious and they don't keep it from being an unforgettable film. There is a lot to understand in the way that the main scenes were set up and shot. The Battleship Potemkin is packed with vibrant metaphors that stay in your brain after you have watched it. The reason I selected this particular film, The Battleship Potemkin is that it is a stunning success of imaginative montages that lead the way for films like Rocky. What makes this such a good film particularly is the well-known Odessa Steps scene where blameless city dwellers are chased away down the steps. The motion picture is an all time movie standard for all film fans. The cinematography is incredible in this Russian film, it used a combination of tracking and crane shots that move with the battle and used modern viewpoint and composition layouts for a film of that time. Historical references that go with this film were easy to find out as the film is based on the historical actions that happened at that time. The motion picture tells the narrative of a rebellion at the battleship Potemkin in Russia. Troops were given gone off meat for food which resulted in the uproar/dispute.",9.0,Anonymous,History

The plot often feels more symbolic than accessible, leaving modern audiences struggling to connect with the events or understand the characters' motivations.

"""Battleship Potemkin"": A Monumental Achievement in Soviet Silent Film","""Battleship Potemkin,"" directed by Sergei Eisenstein and released in 1925, is a landmark film in the history of Soviet silent cinema, and deserves a strong 9/10 rating. This film tells the story of the mutiny on the titular battleship, which took place in 1905 during the Russian Revolution. Through a series of powerful and unforgettable images, Eisenstein tells the story of the sailors' struggle for freedom and dignity against the oppressive forces of the tsarist regime.One of the film's most notable achievements is its innovative use of montage. Eisenstein's editing style, which he called ""intellectual montage,"" was a groundbreaking approach that used a rapid-fire series of shots to convey complex ideas and emotions. In ""Battleship Potemkin,"" Eisenstein uses montage to create a sense of immediacy and urgency, bringing the viewer right into the heart of the action.The film's cinematography is equally impressive. Shot by cinematographer Eduard Tisse, the film's images are visually stunning, with a bold use of light and shadow that heightens the drama and adds to the film's already-powerful atmosphere. The film's mise-en-scène, or overall visual design, is equally impressive, with the film's sets and costumes helping to create a vivid and memorable world that feels both otherworldly and real.The film's soundtrack, composed by Edmund Meisel, is also noteworthy, with a powerful and sweeping score that heightens the film's already-intense atmosphere. The film's use of sound, in general, is noteworthy, with the film's diegetic and non-diegetic sound used to great effect to create a sense of immediacy and to bring the film's world to life.Another standout aspect of the film is its thematic depth. At its core, ""Battleship Potemkin"" is a film about the power of the collective, and the importance of standing up for one's beliefs. The film's depiction of the sailors' struggle against the tsarist regime is both inspiring and powerful, speaking to the human desire for freedom and dignity. These themes are woven into the fabric of the film in a way that makes the film's story all the more impactful, lending the film a depth that many films of its era lack.In conclusion, ""Battleship Potemkin"" is a masterpiece of Soviet silent cinema, a film that remains as relevant and powerful today as it was nearly a century ago. From its innovative use of montage to its visually stunning cinematography and its rich thematic depth, ""Battleship Potemkin"" is a film that truly deserves its place in the pantheon of great films.

A classic even if it is propaganda,"Battleship Potyomkin, a silent film from the early days of the Soviet Union. Made as a propaganda piece, it lives up to that intention but is still a great work of art. The director Eisenstein was only in his late twenties and went on to have a short but successful career.I watched the film on Youtube with English subtitles. This was thanks to the German Film Library Museum of Film and Television. It is a (very) dramatised version of the mutiny on board the battleship Potyomkin. The named characters were all real people from that event, part of the 1905 Russian Revolution. Sweeping reforms were won but many, including Lenin himself, later saw it as a rehearsal for the revolutions of 1917.Whilst watching it is a rewarding experience, it does have a few problems. The film can be repetitive at times and the propagandistic intent simplifies things. One thing to note is that the film has a few splashes of colour towards the end - a red flag that was flown on the ship.A couple of final notes. The Potyomkin itself did not survive until 1925, it was scrapped a few years before. As for the real mutineers, the last survivor died in 1987 at either 102 or 104. If he had lived a few more years, he would have outlived the Soviet Union.Many silent films are now sadly lost to time, but we should be thankful that this one survived. It is propaganda, but it is also a classic film.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Still one of the most ironic and misunderstood movies of all time.,"The title alone would probably tell most Russians that Battleship Potemkin is not what it seems, since in Russian a 'Potemkin village' is something which is not what it seems. In the 18th century, Marshal Potemkin tried to impress Catherine the Great with his supposed success in developing the Volga region by showing her new villages as she sailed down the river. The village buildings were just quickly erected facades with nothing behind them.But did Eisenstein have a choice about the name? Well, it could have been called 'Comrade Vakulinchuk'. Or '1905', without a battleship in sight (it's just a movie made for 20th anniversary of the somewhat abortive 1905 Revolution).Or it could have been called 'Kronstadt 1921'. In 1921, the sailors at Kronstadt naval base outside Leningrad mutinied in protest at the harshness of the policy of War Communism, under the slogan 'Communism without the Bolsheviks'. The mutiny was suppressed by troops ironically led by an aristocrat, Marshal Tukhachevsky (later shot by Stalin in the Thirties). Eisenstein's diary records a lengthy meeting with Tukhachevsky around that time. However Lenin called Kronstadt the spark that lit up the situation, and abandoned War Communism in favor of the much milder New Economic Policy (NEP, 1921-1927). In 1925 Stalin was trying to consolidate his hold on power following Lenin's death the previous year, and he supported the NEP against its left-wing critics.So Eisenstein's leftist-beloved movie is ironically pro-Stalinist but anti-leftist propaganda, warning of the horrors that will return if Stalin is beaten, with the nasty aristocrat-led Cossacks on the Odessa steps in 1905 being allegorical stand-ins for the nasty aristocrat-led Bolshevik troops at Kronstadt in 1921.Of course that particular party line had to go out the window in 1927, when Stalin, having seen off his opponents, promptly adopted their policies and scrapped the NEP.It's strange how neither leftists nor rightists seem to notice any of this despite arguing over the movie for over 75 years.",5.0,Anonymous,History
I liked it...different kind of silent film,"It is about sailors suffering in a ship called Potemkin...they go and protest about the terrible kinds of life they have in the ship , it is very good it is hard to explain how this film makes you feel.

Besides the direction is perfect, the camera works greatly not even for the time the film was made but even for today. I recomend it to everyone! It is not funny...and though it is silent it isn't boring at all. I loved it: 10/10... A classic!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Eisenstein montage is amazing.,"Battleship Potemkin is one of the most influential films of all time. Serguei Eisenstein, the director and writer, is a genius and the way he uses montage is amazing. He creates suspense and emotion with shots like he had a supernatural power. To him, montage wasn't a device like it is used today in most of the movies. For him, it was a way to communicate with the audience in general. The Odessa Staircase sequence and the arrival of the ships at the harbor are great examples of this. The former shows the tragedy of the revolution and the latter, the passion. A curiosity about this picture is that it has 1346 shots. This is the double of the average of the movies at that time. This tells how much Sergei liked and trusted this theory.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A true silent picture masterpiece!,"I'm not one for silent movies, (probably because we live in an age of movies with, you know, sound.) but this tickled my fancy, for some reason. Could it be the cinematography? Or maybe it's because of the truly amazing plot? Or perhaps, I'm just giving into what people think of this movie? Either way, I recommend this movie to anybody who likes these kind of movies.",10.0,Anonymous,History

To the revolution!,"A group of marines had enough. Lead by a charming man, they decided to raise a mutiny against the corrupt leadership of their boat. They somewhat won, but the fight leaves their leader dead. When his body is left in the pier, a group of equally disenchanted masses develop a sense of mutiny themselves only to be crushed by the same military the boatmen tried to overthrow. All hell breaks loose AND the mutiny goes on.Their is a moment in filmmaking when Battleship Potemkin is highly parodies/homage AND I could definitely see why. It is something that just wants you to go up and do something. Its high propaganda THAT does feel relevant, more so after it was made.Eisenstein's style here is just amazing. Every little thing in this film works marvelously. His earlier film of the same year, Strike already has showings of greatness BUT this is where I think it just is developed fully. The story, the actions, the sequences. Its much more pointed and carefully paced. Even his extravagant style from Strike is somewhat subdued here until the climaxes. Its no wonder that this film was voted on top ten of the BFI list for almost six decades until another Russian Montage film (A Man with a Moving Camera) replaced it.Its just so modern and relevant. AND even with the number of parodies, it still feels fresh, which is a testament of Eisenstein's style and storytelling.Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Down with the Tsarist Oppression,"This is Eisenstein taking everything he'd pushed the envelope stylistically on in Strike and applying it in a more streamlined fashion. A stripped down version of a much larger project that was going to include a huge history of the 1905 Revolution, Eisenstein, convinced he didn't have enough time, focused on one episode, the rebellion of the sailors on the eponymous battleship. And it works...extremely well. This is something of a marvel of silent filmmaking. It's exciting, tight at only 70 minutes, and surprisingly involving considering Eisenstein's continued insistence on making a film of the masses without individuals (he bends that rule a bit here).The titular ship, Potemkin, rests in the Odessa harbor with a brewing mutiny. The one person in this whole film with any real delineation is Grigory Vakulinchuk (Aleksandr Antonov), the leader of the group of men who object to being fed meat covered in maggots. It's a powder keg as the haughty commanding officer, the cruel NCO, and the rest of the command lord over the common men who make up the sailing crew. When the crew ends up refusing to eat the meat, led by Vakulinchuk, they are ordered to be put to death which initiates the mutiny.The frustration I found in Strike had a lot to do with the lack of a terribly strong throughline. That was in no small part because there were no characters, just masses and caricatures (on the bad side). Here, enough time is spent with Vakulinchuk that his presence, though cut off at about the halfway point, ends up driving the action through the rest of the film. He gets killed in the mutiny, and then he becomes a martyr to the cause, the people of Odessa filing past his dead body in a tent when the victorious sailors come to shore. He's an inspiration to the people in Odessa, already hearing news of revolution from other parts of Russia, and they coalesce around the sailors of the Potemkin.The film is obviously its most exciting in its final two parts out of five when we see the iconic Odessa Steps sequence and then the final confrontation with another Tsarist naval vessel. This is where Eisenstein's cinematic techniques take their fullest form, telling a story of complex events in tiny pieces stitched together without ever making the action incoherent. There's this flow of information from the images chosen in the order chosen to create a large picture from small pieces. Eisenstein works to create a large montage of images about a large group of people, and it works really well. The focus is on the action of the Tsarist forces massacring groups of innocents who only wish to be free, and it's all guns, marching, babies, and carriages as the people face the wrath of their Tsar for daring to want good meat.The Odessa Steps sequence gets all the praise, but I actually think the faceoff with the other Tsarist naval vessel by the Potemkin crew is more impressive. It's essentially built out of nothing, Eisenstein obviously not able to get footage of two battleships chasing each other in any way (there are some shots of multiple craft, but nothing that could be considered a faceoff in any way), and the montage ends up being created by the cutting of wakes from the ship, moving engine parts, and concerned faces on crew. Combined with the score by Edmund Meisel (to be played by pianists during the showing of the film), and it's an exciting bit of suspense built out of essentially nothing. I find that quite impressive.Really, this is a gem of a movie. It's exciting and thrilling with enough of an actual emotional core to make all of the action work with some impact. This is Eisenstein compromising his original approach to cinematic language by embracing the individual character just enough to provide his actual main character, the mass of Russians, a reason for their revolution. It personalizes the conflict in a way necessary for the film to work dramatically. It's still thin propaganda, but it's great, thin propaganda. It invites the audience to feel the emotional connection to those heroes, 20 years prior, who fell at the dastardly hand of the Tsarist forces. It works, and it works really, really well.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Propaganda Made Watchable,"Based on the 1905 mutiny on the ship bearing the title's name, ""Battleship Potemkin"" is an energetic and highly active account of the uprising and the events that followed. Featuring the events inside the ship which led to the rebellion and what transpired with the crew afterwards the film is one moving narrative of constant action highlighted by the brisk herky-jerky motion of cinema during the time. A taut and bracing script, constantly functioning machinery, humanity in motion - the movie stirs to bigger life in the famous Odessa steps scene where one can still feel the tension and chill of the tragedy as it unfolds. Ironically, with all the activities mentioned the film is snagged by slow parts throughout which highlights the movies lack of depth and shows that a movie has to have more than action to leave a truly profound impact. Famed director Sergei Eisenstein's most well known flick and one of the more successful propaganda efforts made, this overrated product of its time is still one of the more watchable silents to hold up well.",8.0,Anonymous,History

classic Soviet montage,"This is one of the true greats. In the height of the Russian Revolution, a battleship filled with sailors feel poorly treated by the officers. They are served maggot filled meat as a dinner and when they work hard and get nothing but disrespect out of it, they turn against the officers. The film works well because you care about the characters and most of their names arent even given. The battleship arrives near Odessa where a crowd of people wave them on. What follows is one of the most intense scenes ever filmed. The Officers massacre people. Baby carriage and steps, mother clenching her dead child. These are images that are real and get stuck in your head. Go out and rent this. If you cant appreciate silent films then I guess you have no business being on this site. ****",,Anonymous,History
Worthy to a History Buff,"Like Citizen Kane, this is an IMPORTANT film in the development of cinema. Both of these films usually show up in the ""Top Ten Films of all time lists"" and herein lies the confusion. What are the criteria? For modern sophisticated film viewers both films are laughable, but for film history buffs they are worthy films for their breaking of new ground: BP for its use of montage, and CK for its long shots and nonlinear plotting. Modern audiences have seen it all before. Being first is not necessarily equated with being the best, and subsequent films have probably managed to beat these two at their own game. Memento springs to mind as a worthy successor to CK. It doesn't matter if you liked it. It only matters that it did it first.Reception is all",,Anonymous,History
Finally The Definitive Restoration Of This World Cinema Classic.,"It's hard to think of a more important silent film or any major work of world cinema that has taken as long to be issued in a definitive version than BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN. It took many years and the combined efforts of several different film archives to put POTEMKIN back together again but it has been worth the wait for now it is possible to finally see the most influential movie ever made the way it's creator Sergei Eisenstein intended.Ever since the premiere at the Bolshoi Theatre in 1925, POTEMKIN has been subject to censorship in one form or another. Not only was the film cut but the original score by German composer Edmund Meisel was discarded after the film's initial run and this had a huge impact as we can now see and hear in this restoration. The images will always retain their power but they are doubly enhanced by Meisel's propulsive driving score which sounds like Shostakovich who was 19 at the time and must have been influenced by what he heard here. It's ironic that for the film's 50th anniversary (the version most readily available until now) the music of Shostakovich provided the background and the film was cut to fit the music. All of this is covered in the excellent documentary TRACING BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN that comes with this 2 DVD set.As for the movie itself, it has never looked this good. Images are sharp and clear, the contrast of the black and white photography is excellent and the colorization of the raising of the red flag has been restored. Most important of all is the return of the edited material which changes the look and feel of certain scenes. The famous ""Odessa Steps"" sequence is longer, has different points of view, and is more violent than before. The recording of the original score is top notch and, as I said earlier, adds immeasureably to the total film experience. Overall this is a truly astonishing set and one no lover of world cinema should be without.My only complaint, and it's a minor one, is that I wish they had included the 1976 50th anniversary edition as the second disc (instead of the new version with Russian title cards) so that we could see the differences between the two and could note the changes made to bring BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN back to Eisenstein's vision...For more reviews visit The Capsule Critic.",,Anonymous,History
Grotesque and captivating,"Sergei Einstein's silent film, Bronenosets Potyomkin, captures real life events from 1905. It's been named as one of the most influential propaganda films of all time. I don't exactly agree with this, but I do think that Einstein did a wonderful job at showing us the injustice and brutality of actual events. One of the scenes that stood out to me was when the crew was fed rotten, maggot infested meat. I was extremely disgusted by this scene, but thought Einstein did an excellent job at showing us what their life was like aboard the ship, even though it might have been dramatized. There were a number of vivid and grotesque images that stayed in my mind even after I watched it. The Odessa Steps was one of the most violent scenes that I have seen. Einstein did a fabulous job at creating shots that were rapid and sharp. It enhanced the feeling of panic as the civilians run down the stairs. The close-ups used by Einstein of the panicked civilians really captured our class' attention as we gasped and cringed. I believe that the use of these zoom shots added to the drama and emotion of the audiences. In the beginning of this scene he zooms out and captures the full flight of stairs and the mass amounts of helpless civilians. This caused me to feel a sense of panic as I watched this scene due to his shot of the larger picture. As a propaganda film, Einstein did a wonderful job at making us feel sorry for these sailors. Although, this movie wasn't my favorite, I do think that Einstein created a action-packed silent film that had us at the edge of our seats. He did a wonderful job at grabbing our attention even though there was no sound.",,Anonymous,History
Interesting look at a classic,"I'll be the first to admit that film is not my expertise, and many of the nuances in Eisenstein's masterpiece may have been lost on me. It is clear that his control of the camera is impressive, and the way in which he creates emotion through the camera is equally as impressive. However, the story seemed a little contrived to me. Although the underlying event was fact, it seemed to intentionally incite emotion rather than draw it out naturally. In the scene at the steps, this behavior is prevalent. The chaotic stitching of shots together insights the desired emotion, but it ignores the fact that the actual event was much more benign than Eisenstein's reenactment. So, if we wan't a realist reenactment of Soviet Russia during this time period, I would recommend looking somewhere else; however, if you want to see one of the greatest innovators in film history, this is a great film to start. Eisenstein's most notable work was definitely in montage. This film allows us to see how these ideas were invented. Since the concept was unpolished at this point, it allows us to see Eisenstein's intent in creating effects through montage.If your looking for a casual day at the movies, this is not your pick. If you are a scholar of film, then there are a number of interesting points of exploration in terms of composition and exploration in film and narrative techniques. In this aspect, Eisenstein was a true pioneer.I know that was kind of a continued rant on just one aspect of the film, but it most certainly is a defining featuring. In addition, the film doesn't entertain on some level. The action is interesting and does help to see the discontent manifested under Russian Fascism. The plot plays very basic, and barely held my interest. The authorship is almost peripheral to what makes this interesting though.",,Anonymous,History

The DVD release of this film will bring a far wider audience  .  . .,"which is a good thing. Professional film critics detail the significance of Battleship Potemkin far better than I can.Speaking for myself, Eisenstein seems to compose the film as if it were a photo-mosaic.

An important piece of cinema-history,"""Battleship Potemkin"" is a silent movie made in the Soviet-Union in 1925 by master-director Sergej Eisenstein. This powerful movie remains after almost 80 years a landmark in cinema-history.  The movie tells the story of the crew on-board Battleship Potemkin during the revolution of 1905 after Russia had lost the war against Japan. On one side this is pure communist propaganda, on the other side this is probably one of the most powerful movies ever created. I saw this movie myself last year after my university teacher in Russian history recommended it to me.  Powerful imagery is the main element that you will remember after seeing this movie, especially the scene where people are slaughtered at the steps of Odessa in the Ukraine.

One Of The First Films To Unlock The Power Of Cinema,"A five-act story of a rebellion that sparked a revolution, Battleship Potemkin is a masterpiece of silent cinema that simply refuses to age. Often counted amongst the greatest films of all time, the film not only lives up to its mythical reputation but can still profoundly influence its viewers with its powerfully haunting images.Co-written & directed by Sergei Eisenstein, the film's five-act structure features a simple plot that appears straightforward on paper but gains enormous firepower once it goes through the cinematic treatment, thanks to the narrative techniques that Eisenstein experiments with and in process ends up adding a vital chapter to the storytelling manual.For a film of its time, Battleship Potemkin is shockingly violent and that Odessa Steps sequence is truly an all-timer, one that will effortlessly manage to surpass your highest expectations. The last act is just as impressive, benefiting from the perfect harmony attained together by the film's impeccable editing, immaculate camerawork & surging score.Overall, whether you consider it a propaganda piece or a historical account or an enduring portrait of the revolutionary spirit, Battleship Potemkin comes out as a winner on all fronts, and is an astounding achievement of its genre. Immortal for its contribution to cinema, and one of the first films to unlock the art form's true potential, this Soviet classic is essential viewing.",,Anonymous,History

Movie Odyssey Review #014.1,"#014.1 - Battleship Potemkin (1925) - released in Russia 12/21/25; viewed previouslyDOUG: I'd like to say a quick word about this Eisenstein film which we watched in Film Expression class, and were shown it again more recently in our History of Silent Film class (I slept through most of it, as I did with nearly every film we watched in that class, no matter how good). Eisenstein was, of course, a pioneer of film montage, and this film contains one of his best sequences, the famous 'Odessa Steps' sequence which follows a baby carriage rolling down the stairs followed by the oppressive Tsarist soldiers. The subject of Soviet Montage is always a key topic in any Film History class, and while it was important, a lot of my classmates have come to hate it, and feel scarred from being subjected to this and other Eistenstein films (a friend of mine jokingly called Soviet Montage ""Throwing a bunch of random scenes together and calling it a film."") We decided we didn't need to re-watch this film for our Odyssey, since we would just be waiting for the Steps scene, and we've got plenty more Eisenstein to look forward to.KEVIN: I watched Sergei Eisenstein's seminal masterpiece Potemkin freshmen year in college in our Development of Film Expression class. Eisenstein's films are certainly not for the squeamish. It wasn't ever enough for him just to get across what happened. He seemed to want the viewer to be completely immersed in the action and the drama, and he achieved this through an unparalleled use of camera-work, editing, and harrowing depictions of the most graphic imagery ever captured on film for years after. None of his films demonstrate his style as perfectly as Potemkin. It's been years since I watched this film, and most of it I've forgotten, except of course the unforgettable Odessa Steps sequence, which is often regarded as Eisenstein's crowning achievement of film-making. I watched it yet again in another film class, and I managed to sleep through most of it, waking up just in time to see the Odessa Steps. What I stayed awake for I still managed to forget.Last film chronologically: The Big Parade (1925). Next film chronologically: The Black Pirate (1926).",,Anonymous,History

not watching a movie but assessing history,"It has no doubt been years, maybe decades, since anyone came to this movie cold. Film buffs, film school students and historians are obliged to view it, compelled to tick it off on their Viewing List so they can talk about the evolution of varying shot size, juxtaposition, and the Odessa Steps sequence. In fact, my Viewing List recommended watching the Odessa Steps sequence only.An attempt to access the film in terms of empathy for characters, emotional catharsis, or intellectual stimulation, is fraught with difficulty. The film is silent, foreign, ancient and propagandist. Yes, the shot flow, when analysed, reveals significant steps in the evolution of cinema narrative. However, The Boneshaker Bicycle was an important step in the development of bikes, but I wouldn't want to ride one. BP no doubt thrilled its contemporary audience, and film theorists can tell us why it is important.

One of the All-Time Great Directors,"What would Eisenstein do today!  His films still pack tremendous wallop even 65 years later.  Yes, the baby carriage falling down the steps and the bullet in the eye still impact today, but the most telling image is the lock-step soldiers with rifles and bayonets at the ready, treading forcefully down the steps is an even greater image! Eisenstein's films are masterworks of double entendre for just as he silently condemns the czarist authorities, the irony that he portrays is that the communists are just as guilty.  I believe that his films deliberately show this irony as his way of damning all authoritarian/totalitarian regimes, and he got away with this in the USSR by doing precisely this. The characters in his films are not first-rate actors, but the images and faces of these characters are startling in their realism.  Watch the monk playing the organ in ""Alexander Nevsky"" and you'll see what I mean. What a face!  And Eisenstein...what an artist of the first rank!",,Anonymous,History
