"A hell of a funny film, but with a message.","When you have the reputation that Parker and Stone do, it is hard to get rid of the sterotypes that have been drawn around you.  You are forever stuck in the mold that has been bestowed upon you.  But perhaps sometimes when stigmas of that nature are forever embedded with your name and reputation, it actually gives them more leeway to make a statement that is political in nature.  As long as they disguise that statement(s) with all that made them popular in the first place, they can get away with it.  So now, if I said that beyond the non-stop vulgarity and infinite humour that this film contains, is a film that has an important message camouflaged in animation, would you believe me?  Would you care?First off, this is the most profanity laced film I have ever seen in my life, and that includes early Eddie Murphy efforts.  But the profanity in this film had me in stitches.  Honestly, that was almost not just a figure of speech either.  I laughed so hard that I almost banged my head on the on the person in front of me.  Remember how absorbed you were at the horror of war at the beginning of Private Ryan?  Well if you had to parallel the two and replace horror with humour, that is a safe comparison.  This film is so ******* funny and I really enjoyed it on that level.  I can honestly say that I haven't laughed so hard since Office Space.  The profanity goes a bit overboard at times but I think that was on purpose.  Some of the humour is a bit gross ( seeing Sadam's rubber propalactic was funny but a little sick at the same time ) but I think these guys wanted to see how far they could go. And they went very far and they dared the MPAA to censor them even more, and hey, I was very entertained.But on the political side, there are a lot of dicey issues that are covered here.  Censorship for one.  It's funny because we as Canadians and Americans have some of the same ideologies and one of them is free speech.  But if that is what we want, then we have to be willing to go all the way.  You can't pick and choose what is more free and more appropriate than something else just because it is not politically correct.  Free speech means free speech.  Free to express your thoughts in an open forum.  This film tells us that free speech is free as long as you don't offend the masses.  It also says that in MPAA's world it is okay to see blood and guts and intestines and brain tissue ( many of those films get an AA rating ) but profanity dictates that an R or an X is required to see the film.  That really is silly.The film also touches on racism in the armed forces and it shows how brain washed Americans get when there is a conflict with an opposing nation.  It doesn't matter that perhaps some of the issues at hand are clouded and misunderstood, many  people stand behind their government to the very end. Kill em' all in the name of the Constitution.  There are also some stabs at religion and being gay and a plethora of other issues.  A particular scene with Bill Gates is funny.Parker and Stone have given the finger to the ratings system in America and I think people will like it.  They have also given much more credit to the Canadian armed forces in this movie.  If the U.S. ever went to war with us, it would probably be over in a day or so.  So thanks for making us look at least competetive.  That was cool.It may be weird to read a review of this film and have comments about politics in here, because it really is a funny movie and I was in a good mood when I left the theater, but there is more to this movie than just humour.  To accomplish that and still be known as the guys who made fart jokes and the F word popular is quite a feat.  This film is there to enjoy but it is also there to ask some tough and interesting questions.  Enjoy the film, but listen to what it has to say.  That is, besides the F and S word, listen to what it wants to say.**** One last observation and that is, when I was in line for the film, a lady and her five year old daughter were in front of me.  When they asked for South Park, the cashier asked if she was sure because there is a lot of profanity in the film.  The lady reassured her that it was fine.  Her daughter can listen and watch but knows not to repeat.  That is responsible parenting.  Teach your kids right from wrong and hope they turn out well. That's all you can do.  And I applaud that parent for doing so.  She may never know who I am but I will remember her for quite some time.  Maybe if more people were like that, there wouldn't be such a fuss about profanity. After all, they are just words.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Must see for fans  but funny and clever enough for a wider audience,"In the quiet little town of South Park Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny bride a tramp to sneak them into an R screening of the new Terrance & Phillip movie. They emerge foul mouthed and with attitude as a result of the movie and, while repeating a stunt in the film, Kenny is killed and sent to Hell. Kyle's mother leads a movement against the Canadian comedians that results in their arrest and sentencing to death.  Meanwhile in Hell, Satan and his lover Saddam Hussain prepare for the killing of Terrance & Phillip  the sign of the coming of the new time where Satan will rise again to rule the earth.  Can Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny save the comedians, stop the censorship movement that blames society for bad behaviour and prevent Satan and Saddam from destroying the world?I suspect those that hate this movie are generally those who hate the TV show, where those who liked it may not be those who watch the show.  I'm a fan of the show but I not such a fan that I blind to the lack of consistency at times in the show  some episodes are dumb and lack wit, trading on swear words and forced jokes.  However I fell in love with this movie from my first time seeing it.  The film is funny in the same sort of silly juvenile way that the series is.  It has the same strange sense of humour  witness Conan O'Brien having a `Judas' moment and throwing himself to his death!However on top on this it is imaginative.  How many other crude films would do it as a musical.  I'm not saying that this makes it more worthy than gross out comedies like American Pie etc, but it is cleverer.  The musical element adds to the film and helps it's stretched running time.  The songs are all catchy and are better than some of Lloyd-Webber's stuff!  They are choreographed well and just feel funnier due to the situation and the lyrics!  For example Satan's song `Up there' is excellent but hilarious because of who's singing it and the sentiments he's expressing!The irony of the film is not lost.  The accusations levelled at the South Park Movie are those that the mothers in the film level at Terrance & Phillip.  The story actually answers it's own critics while telling the story!  It's not perfect and it does go a bit over the top and maybe begins to think that it is cleverer than it actually is.The voice work is as excellent as always and Parker and Stone carry this the whole way home.  Guest stars add some interest but really all I need is Cartman et al and I'm set!Overall I am a South park fan and I really enjoyed this.  Not just because of the elements of the show that are reproduced here but also how clever it feels (even if it isn't always as smart as it wants to be).  This isn't a cheap TV spin off into a movie this is a film that is imaginative and funny. Haters of the show will hate this but this may win you over if you thought the TV show was juvenile and a waste of time.",,Anonymous,Animation
A truly subversive movie,"I was not a fan of South Park before I saw BL&U, nor was I a fan of movie musicals. Well, I'm still not a fan of musicals, but I'm a fan of *this* musical, and am grateful to Parker and Stone for demonstrating that it's still possible to make a great movie on one's own terms.For this movie, unlike the usual feature-length adaptation of a pop culture phenomenon, not only lives up to its pedigree, it wildly exceeds it. Yes, the movie does recycle many of the show's jokes, but it does so in new yet relevant contexts that keep the material funny if you are familiar with the South Park world. If you aren't familiar with that world (as I wasn't before seeing the movie), the gags are simultaneously accessible yet often subtle.Subtle? Yes, many of the gags are. Indeed, one of the pleasures of owning a copy of the movie is having the ability to review the movie, in slo-mo if necessary, and discover throwaway sight gags that one has missed in the delirium of watching this anarchic satire the first time through.  (And if you have the DVD, you can add subtitles to catch many of the songs' often elusive lyrics.)Then there's the music. What is it about movie musicals that attracts great satiric minds? Not since Pynchon's ""Gravity's Rainbow"" has a work of art so subversively exploited the conventions of the movie musical as South Park. From the droll opening strains of Mountain Town, to the Disneyesque ""Up There,"" to the Les Miserables spoof, ""La Resistance,"" South Park simultaneously sends up the genre while paying homage to it, and still finds room to use the songs to score delicious points against its myriad targets.One last thing: this movie is not cynical. Beneath the scatological humor, the cartoon violence, the scathing portrayals of Wynona Ryder et al, and the backdrop of adult xenophobia, sexual repression and political opportunism, is a sensibility that exalts childhood as an island of honesty and idealism, if also of id-like impulse and frequent selfishness. In this they share space on the shelf of great satires with ""Candide,"" ""Gulliver's Travels,"" ""Tom Sawyer"" and especially ""Huckleberry Finn""--classics that, like BL&U, also exposed the hypocrisies of the adult world ""through the eyes of a child.""Elvis Costello once sang, ""I want to bite the hand that feeds me/I want to bite that hand so badly/I want to make them wish they'd never met me."" That BLU was shut out at the Academy Awards (having only garnered a nomination for the relatively tame ""Blame Canada"", which lost, appropriately enough, to the execrable Phil Collins) only vindicates the film's take-no-prisoners send-up of nearly everything that annoys in this suffociatingly focus-group-tested, PC-policed, cynically sentimental, violence-ridden, love-starved modern world. See this movie, and see the persistence of hope and possibility sparkling like a diamond amid the pop culture detritus of a quiet little red-necked, white-trash, strait-laced, mesuggeneh, US mountain town.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Vulgarity at it's finest!!!!!!!!,"What can I say but OH MY GODS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I had heard rumors about this movie's extremities (no pun intended) and that it was much more...ahem...wild than the t.v. show.  Now, I've only seen a handful of the television shows, and they're pretty racy and raunchy, but I've always liked what I've seen.  It's definitely not a show (or movie!) for kids.  Or the faint of heart, or the easily offended.  But then again, if you know that you're an easily offended person DON'T GO SEE THIS MOVIE!I loved this movie.  Granted, I have to admit that I was shocked and surprised through 95% of it.  But it was great nonetheless. It was funny and vulgar and said pretty much everything in a manner that was NOT politically correct.  But then again, aren't we all getting pretty sick of political correctness?I think one of the things that gets most of us, (at least myself) is that when we were kids that age, we never would have gone around saying half of what those kids did.  Or, if we did, we did our best not to get caught!  Of course, I was only ever threatened with getting my mouth washed out with soap...not my mother starting a war with a foreign country!The musical numbers were great!  They were very upbeat and will stick in the minds of viewers for years to come.  In the future, when we're all sitting behind our desks (or whatever jobs we may have), we'll notice that we'll be humming certain catchy tunes and when we stop to wonder what it is, we'll remember the songs from South Park both with humor and with horror that we're actually humming them out in the ""civilized"" world.  The scene I think the best for musical numbers was where several of the different songs were going on at one time.  It was very ""Les Miserables"" like (I saw the musical so I know what I'm talking about) in a very sick and twisted sort of way. It was simply funny and light hearted.This movie poked fun at just about everything in the book.  Nothing was spared.  Not Christianity, not different racial stereotypes, and certainly not the gay community.  But none of it was handled in a fashion to be hateful or humiliating.  In my opinion, all the jabs were meant to get people to see that there shouldn't be the divisions that there are and when people get separated, they leave themselves open to ridicule and criticism. Rather if we all came together and put aside the divisions and stereotypes, then perhaps we could all see the humor in remarks and jabs like the ones made in this movie.As for the political statement: it's true, you know.  This country (as are many others) is always looking for something or someone else to blame for all the ""troubles.""  We as a nation are hypersensitive to every little thing and just about everything is taboo.  From swearing to being able to purchase certain adult oriented ""toys,"" a person can't do anything in this country without being censored or ""forbidden"" to.  It's sad when a state's laws or a person's hysteria keeps people from their constitutional right of free speech and the like.  And this is what this movie was trying to point out. I agree with the person who is his review of this movie wrote, ""They're just words"" about the swearing in the movie.  And that's all they are.I give this movie a 10 for its humor, its musical numbers and its obvious statements.  I think that everyone (who has an open mind) should go see this movie...and then go again and take someone who doesn't have an open mind so that it can be opened by the hilarious things said and done in this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Classic.  Beyond Funny.,"First of all, let me preface this by saying that I am not a huge fan of South Park the TV show.  While I find the TV show amusing, I do not watch it more than once every few months.  So I had doubts about the movie, but my brother insisted I watch it.  So I did and ended up purchasing the DVD the next day.All comedy aside, this is one of the most masterfully written movies I have ever seen.  The songs are hilariously funny and the way that they incorporate all the individual songs into one masterpiece is sheer genius. Probably one of the best musicals I have seen.As for the humor, don't watch this if you are easily offended, because you will be offended.Funny, funny, funny.   10 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
eloquent profanity,"Nothing can prepare you for this film. It's a one off. Undoubtedly the best film I have ever seen. I truly laughed until I cried in the cinema showing, bought the video and the soundtrack - which I never do - and have watched it several times over. The political undertones are frighteningly poignant. The idea is brilliant. It's the antidisney. It's a fart in the face of those who wage war in the name of decency. It's a bunch of foul mouthed kids spewing profanity. It's better than good versus evil; it challenges us to asses the criteria upon which we judge good and evil. It pokes fun at everyone, white, black, Jewish, Christian - but particularly the stupid and the bigoted. by ridiculing the fuss that is made against profanity, the writers have safeguarded themselves against adverse publicity from complaints. It's what the film is about in the first place. My only complaint is that this film is so brilliant that it made Team America seem tame.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Best Animated Comedy I've Ever Seen,"South Park: Bigger, Longer and Un-cut is a great movie.  Not only because the TV show (South Park) is one of the best animated shows of the 90's but also because of it's comedy, political and social satire, and though you can't see it right away, a look into censorship and what bad and good qualities it's doing to American life.  And it also shows that Trey Parker and Matt Stone seem just like a bunch of comedy writers and composers, but that they could be truly freedom fighters by show-casing this film.The story is about the four boys of South Park (Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Kenny McCormick, and Eric Cartman) and after they go into a rated R Terrence and Phillip flick, they start to use their new founded dirty words to excessive use.  Since the film is Canadian, a war breaks out between Canada and America.  Kenny dies (thats not a giveaway because on the TV show Kenny dies in every episode) and winds up in hell to find Sadaam Hussein and Satan as gay lovers.  Both plot sides are very hilarious (depending on if you watch the show) and it's very satirical (if you don't believe me, just look at Bill Gates getting shot in the movie).The Movie seems quite content in it's dirty foul-ness and funny comedy musical type way to make us laugh (not that thats a bad thing), but I think that Matt and Trey are tying to tell us something with this film.  It is a wakeup call to America that if censorship doesn't change soon, we might actually go to war with a country over something as arbitrary as censorship and freedom.  Or... it's just a good old fashioned comedy with fart jokes, sex humor, and a Winona Ryder playing ping-pong in her private area.  Of course that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.  Never-the-less, this film is one of the best of the year.  A++",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
What do you get when South Park becomes a movie???? Well it's like...,"Eminem meeting Disney and a horror film (you'll know what I mean when you've seen the film), it really has not much of a plot, but it still is entertaining. Due to a few comic lines a few nice songs and a good moral. Well of course you might consider it offensive but I don't (OK I'm from Holland and we've brought you Paul Verhoeven) but still, you can't be offended if you have a sense of humour and if you remember this is ONLY a film.The message of this film (the moral) is the same that the makers of South Park have tried to bring over in their series, only they stuffed it in a better box with this film.7 out of 10To all the people who criticised this movie, because of it's bad language, violence etceteras: You have NOT learned a thing and you'd better watch this movie again.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
So Exrteme You'll Love It,"If you're not a fan of non-stop swearing, crude humor, musicals, satire, violence, or just South Park in general then don't watch this. Trey Parker and Matt Stone hold nothing back during this movie. Everything they can't get away with on television they do so with Bigger, Longer, and Uncut. Weather anyone believes it or not BLU is a musical in every respect. From the intro song(Small Mountain Town) to the money number(Uncle F*cker, which you will find yourself singing in the shower), this is a musical top to bottom. The movie kicks off with the kids going to see the Terrance and Phillip movie where they hear so many bad words they become corrupted and begin to use them in their every day lives. Kyle's mom is so outraged by this film that she, along with the rest of South Park, manage to get the United States to go to war with Canada for sending the Terrance and Phillip movie to America. Stan, Kyle, and Cartmen form a resistance group to fight their parents and the war, and Kenny goes to Hell where Satan and Saddam (who are gay lovers in the movie) plan on taking over Earth by using the war. This movie is so great it's hard not to love it, especially since it made the Book of World Records for 399 swear words and 128 offensive gestures. Parker and Stone out-did themselves with this movie. You'll laugh until you hurt.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Classic subverive film making.,"In the form of a cheaply made cartoon. I saw this with a full houseof kids and adults, who were laughing so hard they could hardlyhear the dialogue. I was shocked at a few scenes, but overalllaughed through the whole thing. And you know what, it's also oneof the best musicals made in the last 10 years.

Do people really understand the satire?,"I will admit I am not a big fan of South Park. I've only seen about 4 tv episodes, and I don't find the crude humor that amusing. So as you can imagine, I wasn't expecting that much out of the movie when my friend dragged me into the theatre. After watching the movie, I am still not really a South Park fan, although there was something about the movie that was both impressing and disturbing. South Park is an incredibly sardonic, cynical movie. The entire film is basically poking fun at our society in recent times. A logical parallel can be drawn between the plot of the movie, and our nation's attack on violence in the media. While the teenagers in the theatre laugh at crass remarks such as the Uncle $@%!# song, do they realize that they are symbolizing the very objects that the makers of the movie are so heavily poking fun at? If one realizes this, it is very amusing, and for me was probably the funniest part of the movie, however I am afraid that the majority of the kids seeing this movie do not realize that they are laughing at themselves and other controversial parts of our society that so many of us share.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Funnier, Faster, and Delicious","When ""South Park"" first appeared on the scene, I dismissed it without ever really watching it. I wasn't too interested in watching little kids yell and curse at each other. When ""Baseketball"" opened last July, it was there and then that I began to understand the humor and musical styling of ""Park"" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Last year also saw the release of the duo's ""Orgazmo"" and ""Cannibal : The Musical"", both made prior to the ""South Park"" phenomena. I became a fan. With ""South Park : Bigger, Longer, and Uncut"", the television show makes the giant leap to the big screen with a completely over the top feature that will probably end up as the one summer film that gives the audience the most pop for it's coin. To synopsize the film would be too painful (and boring).  It's so packed with plot and characters that a one sentence generalization would do the film no justice.  I'll put it this way : If you don't know, get, or find ""South Park"" funny, DON'T GO SEE THE FILM.  There might be droves of walkouts as soon as the opening sequence ends by people who thought that a cartoon could never be ""that bad"".  The R rating and the ""Uncut"" of the title are there for a reason.  Heed the signs. Paced like a bat out of hell, ""South Park"" is the funniest film to come around in some time.  While most of the jokes might seem stale to real ""Park"" devotees, Director Parker knows exactly how to keep the film flowing, and in the process, show us new sides and characters that used to be unattainable on Comedy Central.  The movie is vulgar and offensive, that's the idea. But Parker and Stone never once get meanspirited about things, always making sure everybody get a slice of the laughingstock pie. The dreaded ""bleeping"" of the curse words is finally gone, leaving Parker and Stone their first chance to show the world just how far they can take this concept.  After hostilities with the ratings board over the NC-17 given to ""Orgazmo""(which was harmless fun), this new film( which is far more raunchy than ""Orgazmo"") can be easily viewed as one big middle finger to the ratings board.  It's the first film I have ever seen that purposely goes unbelievably far just to see what they can actually get away with.  It's very interesting to compare this film, which made it out with a R rating, to others that were slapped with the NC-17.  I believe that this is what Parker and Stone had in mind. Watching the antics of Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny on the silver screen does have it's advantages.  The film is decidedly cinematic, often jumping to show-stopping musical numbers that I love Parker for.  Working with Marc Shaiman, Parker brings us a whole new load of songs that are equal parts silly, and yet retain some musical respect.  A just world would find evil Canadians Terrence and Phillip's ""Uncle Fu**a"" at the number one spot on the charts.  Like ""Cannibal"", the songs stay in the head. They move beyond their comic foundation and feel like real songs, Parker has a musical gift and this ""South Park"" feature really showcases it. But don't fret fans, the film is jammed packed with comedy that represents what ""South Park"" is all about.  Canadians, African-Americans, Jews, Catholics, the poor, the wealthy, gay, straight, bi, men with voiceboxes, men with puppets on their hands... Everyone is made fun of here.  And every moment of this 80 minute film is comedic gold.  Like the ""Beavis And Butthead"" film, this movie comes out just as people are beginning to write off the TV series.  And similar to ""Butthead"", this film has made a true fan out of me.  No other flick this year will have the stamina, the audacity, and the sheer momentum to please like this little ""South Park"" film.  I give Parker and Stone endless credit for crafting a film that nobody will expect, and that every fan will relish.--------- 9",,Anonymous,Animation
official: comedy genius,"its easy to see why a lot of people may be offended by this film. After all, it makes fun of black people, Jews, women , Canada, homosexuality, homeless people, fat people and of course Barbara Streisand...miss anything out!!?! yet if you like it you can't help but admit that the movie is comedy genius. The opening 10 minutes had me rolling in the aisles ""how would you like to suck my b#lls, Mr garrison?"" and the song ""its easy mmmmkay"" being some of the highlights. the jokes while repetitive (based on swearing or insulting someone) never get old and the genius of ideas such as ""operation get behind the darkies"" while being offensive are undeniably funny. the only people who would rate this movie any less than at least 7 are the pathetic types who'll say ""oh its to vulgar and rude and offensive"". thats the point! so if you're someone who can laugh at yourself (which we should all be able to in an un-serious movie such as this) and want to witness some amazing moments of comedy genius than this is for you. special shout out to the creators of south park for the character Eric cartman, the real star of this movie who would be up there on par with homer simpson for all time greatest comedy character if not for his foul mouth and habit of insulting well..everyone! 10/10 from me for all the nights this ones cheered me up with out fail.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"The bravest, smartest, most emotional comedy of all time","South Park is ultimate social criticism through art. The drawings look intentionally amateurish, so that the viewer can both focus on the dialogs and also realize that non-Hollywood ethics are applied throughout the show.In South Park nothing is sacred; there is no political correctness - the purest form of fascism and hypocrisy. In fact everything that is ""right"" in modern society is ridiculed, to the point of exhaustion. The ideal comedy.There is another aspect of South Park that is almost always overlooked. The characters are emotionally charged. The creators care about their characters and they always take the time to explore the aspects of their personality in depth. No one is bad here, it's just that everyone functions in their own way.I was relieved to read the comments of the alarmed American parents, who warn everyone not to let their kids watch the show. It's the same people who protest against Internet pornography and show their paranoid concern about how it can corrupt our children. They prove that South Park exists for a reason.I don't know if Hollywood will allow the creators of South Park to continue their journey, but their creation will forever live as the ultimate statement in modern cinema/television.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut: 7/10","Most TV shows that are made into movies usually suck. However, every once in a while, a TV show-movie comes along that has fans awe-struck, and that's what South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is. If you love the series, you'll love the movie. If you're like me and enjoy the show but don't find it hilarious, that's the same as what you'll think of the movie. If you think it's deplorable for its language and curse anyone who watches, wellstay away from this movie.Surprisingly short and entertaining, it's also surprisingly a musical. Although it boasts famous songs like `Blame Canada' and `Kyle's Mom is a Big Fat B**ch', they're all basically the same. They are, however, memorable and unexpected. I don't religiously watch the show, but occasionally I do and have a laugh at it. It's basically what you'd expect from a 30-minute crudely animated TV show. It's a fast-paced movie that has four kids from South Park, Colorado, who try to stop the United States from waging war against Canada. In it is childhood love, Conan O'Brian committing suicide, V-chips, and much more.Paramount must have paid the Guinness World Record people a lot of money, because it holds a record for `most swearing in an animated movie'. There are 399 curse words (about 128 F-words) and 128 offensive gestures, and I saw it uncut on Comedy Central. It's probably going to make Comedy Central receive its highest ratings, but I don't really see why. It's funny at times, very funny, but it isn't consistent, and the plot moves too quickly for its own good.The show's creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, who also wrote the film, voiced most of the main characters, who all sounded the same. At times, it was hard to understand what the characters were saying, but the animation was a little better than the TV series. However, nobody would care about that. All they want to do is laugh, and I think there are better movies than this to do that in, but if you see South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut, you won't be disappointed, or not much.My rating: 7/10Rated R for pervasive vulgar language and crude sexual humor, and for some violent images.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great Satire,"South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut is unique, as it is likely the only movie adaptation of a television show that was popular with both critics and audiences.  It is also one of the funniest animated films ever made.  The film takes satiric aim at American culture, through the premise of a war between the US and Canada started by an ""obscene"" Canadian film.  Like MASH, South Park contrasts the perceived obscenity of language and sexuality with the true obscenity of war and violence.  The film has become even more poignant in these dark times of wars fought under false pretenses.The film is also a musical and benefits from the catchy tunes of Trey Parker and Marc Shaiman.  Highlights include the ""Blame Canada"" song and a Stanley Kubrick/Anthony Burgess tribute involving the V-chip. It is an excellent film overall and is among my favorite animated features.   10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The world of South Park comes alive... funnier than ever.,"If you carry all of your sensibilities into the theatre with you will surely have them all crushed. This movie was made to make fun of itself, its viewers, and most others in between. They spare no one- and it's beautiful.The story would stand alone (in the world of South Park). The cracks, the singing numbers (M'kay), and the eyebrow raising humor just add to the enjoyment of the film.Since most of the jokes did not have the traditional set-up/punchline format, I embarrassingly found myself being the only one in the theatre laughing through much of the movie.Best of all, the movie really does present a relatively accurate microcosm of American ignorance and intolerance as well as the -soon to be- trademark humor of *the next generation*. The messages of the irony of American Freedom of Speech is also a focus of the movie (if you could claim it to have focus). Overall, it was a funny, abrasive comedy that will keep you laughing again and again.This will be the movie I'll show my children when they get old enough to ask, ""What was your childhood like daddy?"" -If they can handle it (but I think we all know that, by then, they will be desensitized well past the extremes of this movie).",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fun for the whole family,"Yeah right!:)So I finally got to see the ""South Park"" movie. It's nothing special but it makes its point. It's a world-class parody Mel Brooks wouldn't mind bringing to life, only it's intended for adults only(at least I presume). It's filled with sing-along songs, constantly making fun of the Disney legacy of musicals, but the songs are smart and witty as well.The funniest part of the movie simply has to be the whole German scheisse video scene which made me laugh so hard I almost dropped the glass I was holding in my hand.Not quite as funny as I'd hoped it would be, but still a decent movie. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Boring, Lackluster and Un-entertaining!","I have really enjoyed watching the series every week on TV. I was hoping for a longer and more outrageous version of the show on the big screen. NOT!The movie starts off with a choreographed song and went downhill from there. I thought I paid to see a comedic movie NOT a musical!  It seemed that after every 5 minutes of ""normal"" South Park there was a 3 minute break for the ""musical"" version.It did have its ""side-splitting"" moments as in the small screen version, but just as it was getting good, here comes another song. After the third or fourth song it was getting harder to find anything funny in South Park.  By the end of the film I was wishing I could get my money back!So if you really enjoy South Park keep watching weekly episodes you might find them more hilarious!",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Why does something so wrong feel so right?,"Trey Parker and Matt Stone really are sick guys. Making Sidam Hussein Satan's gay lover...where did they think that up? It doesn't matter because this movie was phenomenal.South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut has taken the American people on a joy ride through heaven, hell, and Colorado. The boys we have come to know and love on Comedy Central find a new home on the big screen. Stan Marsh, Kyle Broslofski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick are bigger, better, and uncensored in this movie...and it's wonderful. Four fourth graders singing, dancing, and swearing like there is no tomorrow make one hell of a cast.The story starts off with the release of the new Terrance and Phillip movie, Asses of Fire. This creates such a shock-wave that Kyle's mother gets the two Canadian superstars arrested and put in the electric chair during a USO show. It is so similar to what parents go through whenever they find something offensive and think their children are in danger.Once Satan finds out that the US and Canada are at war, he and his lover Sidam Hussein...that's right...decide it is the perfect time to unleash hell on earth. Kenny finds out because he is dead and sent to hell. Surprised he is dead? Didn't think so. It's his job to warn his friends of the incoming danger. What results from all this chaos is non stop hilarity.What makes this movie so amazing is that it isn't just a South Park movie...it's basically a South Park Musical! Trey and Matt have written an entire movie's worth of songs. Each one funnier than the next. The Academy Award nominated song, ""Blame Canada"", performed by Robin Williams at the Oscars and by Kyle's mother in the movie, is incredible.The madness doesn't stop with the singing and the dancing, the censorship on TV is no more and the kids like the F-bombs fly...and more...and worse. Hearing fourth graders cuss like that is too much and makes the movie very enjoyable.South Park: Bigger Better & Uncut is one of the best guilty pleasures around and everyone should take part in it at least some time in their lifetime. It is a timeless epic film done in animation. Although Phil Collins beat South Park out for the Oscar with his song from Disney's Tarzan, this movie is a winner.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good transition to a movie -- great songs!,"I've been watching the show since it started back in '97, so of course i went and saw the movie when it opened.  I was a little concerned when hearing that it was done as a musical, as all the voices are pretty unique and wasn't sure how they would convert over to singing, but was pleasantly surprised.  The songs are very well done, and the 'singing' voices of the characters are all actually pretty good!I was definitely excited to also see what they would do without needing to be censored for TV.  The comedy of the TV show shines through, and you can easily see how ""different"" the authors are when they're not required to keep some things out for TV viewing.As the show continues to do well and keeps coming back for more, they should definitely make another one!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
That Movie Will Warp your fragile little mind,"I was a fan of South Park anyway but i adore The movie. This movie is a fantastic Comedy Musical but not to be seen by those easily offended! The basic story is The 4 boys see a R-rated movie and start to swear like there is no tomorrow and as the film was made in Canada the Americans go to war. It also includes Satan and a certain Iraqi dictator you might of heard of trying to take over the world. It has some brilliant characters and some songs that would make Scrooge laugh including Unkle Fu**a, I'm Super, M'cay, Blame Canada and loads more.

A masterwork of obscene satire and musical animation,"First of all, let me just get something out of the way here, and set it absolutely straight before I begin: Ever since mid-August of 1997 (and probably until around early 2000), I was an unnervingly obsessed fan of the phenomenal TV milestone that was Comedy Central's animated series, ""South Park"". As it premiered in that actual month (August '97), you could say I was with that show from virtually the beginning. Since I had never seen anything like it before, what with its weird construction-paper-cutout animation and unconventional dark humour, I felt I had found the perfect new cartoon to help cope with the fallout from my equally short-lived ""Beavis & Butt-head"" phase just a few months prior.Fast-forward to around December of 1998 - the time I became aware of a fact that, at the time, seemed FAR too good to be true: There was going to be a ""South Park"" MOVIE!!! You have no idea how wonderful this was to me...and after I downloaded the few teaser trailers (the ones that solemnly started off with scenes of high-tech computer animation before shifting to Cartman's likeness), the taste of anticipation was rising furiously. I can say with 100% assurance that I have never, EVER, at any moment in my life before (or since) anticipated a movie more than I was anticipating ""South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"". It seemed appropriate enough that the film would be released in the summer of 1999 - the exact period when my obsession with ""South Park"" was at its highest peak! Of course, nothing could ever top that historical moment (at least from my experience) of walking into the theatre with my dad on opening night (naturally!) and finally watching those lights dim to prepare us for a sick, twisted, epic journey unlike anything we would ever see!At first, like most other hardcore fans, I was shocked initially when news broke that the ""South Park"" movie was going to be done in the style of - ""gasp"" - a MUSICAL! As a matter of fact, for a brief moment I was actually doubting the success of this ambitious project...It certainly had the potential to accentuate the show's sudden leap onto the big-screen format. Still, the question was: Would good ol' Trey and Matt pull it off? I wasn't really surprised when I immediately bought the soundtrack upon its release a while before the film's release; by the time I heard the first track's lilting opening Disney-esque score I had forgotten for a second that I was about to listen to something that could be considered about as ANTI-Disney as one can get! Nevertheless, one couldn't deny the impressive fervor with which the composers/orchestra lampooned such generic animated musical stylings. It obviously made me look forward to the film even more...and boy, did the wait ever pay off! I can't say I've had a more memorable, exciting, and just plain good ol' time at the movies! Even my dad (whom I don't think knew much about the show) was chuckling every so often, making me think he was rather enjoying the offensive chaos - although by its end, and our exit from the theatre, there was actually not a word that was exchanged between us until we got to the car. (I guess he didn't enjoy it as much as I thought) The fact of the matter was, however, that I had finally seen something I had considered to be a golden entry into the annals of film history! Even better was the unexpected critical acclaim that was being showered all over this film, praising it for its refreshingly shocking humour, razor-sharp wit, and merciless satire of everything from Canadians to Conan O'Brien! I was very pleased to see that others shared my strong opinion that this film was - in its own unique, special way - a true masterpiece. Filled with showstopping larger-than-life musical numbers, beautifully ""evolved"" animation (by comparison to the show at the time - I was shocked, SHOCKED, to actually see the children's feet moving when they walked!!), and of course, a record-breaking number of profanities/offensive images, ""South Park: BLU"" is one for the ages. Call my taste questionable if you must, but I am (and always will be) an unabashed admirer of such an outrageously fun show, that I never thought could ever follow up to such cinematic success (it didn't). ""South Park"", as a show and ESPECIALLY as a movie adaptation, has done wonders with influencing my sense of humour, as well as some of my own views of the world and celebrity culture (whether that's for better or for worse is left open for interpretation). It's one of my favourite films of all time, and that will never change.VIVA ""LA RESISTANCE""!!!",,Anonymous,Animation
One of the greatest animated movies ever seen by the human eye.,"The South Park movie has many great themes as to why it is so good; one reason is that it has succeeded in telling a story that could have failed in more than a 1,000 ways, and the movie has been made in such a way that no live action movie could possibly do it better. I'm a person  who watches ""South Park"" regularly (on T.V.), and  I can say that the movie is viewer friendly to people who never watch the TV series, is different from the TV series, and it stays true to the TV series. The opening of the movie intentionally makes fun of the opening sequence to ""Beauty and the Beast."" Although the TV show sometimes does songs, the movie purposely does several songs to keep the movie lively, and turns it into a musical. The first song of the movie is probably the most important because it introduces the main characters. Many people believe that South Park is mindless cursing and swearing, and that maybe true, but the first swearing word in the movie is actually forshadowing of what will happen to Kenny (one of the lead characters) when he dies. The song that has the most  swearing in it is the Terance & Philip song. The song consists of the most swearing words I've ever heard in a single minute. What makes this song so great is that it symbolizes how many times a child hears a swearing word before they actually start using it. What people might hate most about this movie is how offensive it is (especially towards Canadians, but I've heard before that anyone who finds South Park offensive is probably not thinking. I personly have relatives who are Canadian. Beyond the story of the movie there are other things that make the movie interesting; such as the bad animation. But this is actually another high point of the movie. Nowadays people have become so familiar with the stunning, breathtaking, life like animation that South Park takes the audience back to when the first animators experimented with stop motion animaition. To date ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut"" has recieved an Acadamy Award nomination for the song ""Blame Canada"", has made it into the ""Guinness Book of World Records"" for having the most swearing (399 times of swearing) and is on IMDb's  list of the best animated films. I have made a top ten list of the best animated films, and South Park had made it to number one. Ranking higher than ""Prince Mononoke"" and ""Spirited Away."" This is the kind of movie that people should let their kids see, but only if the parents can teach their children the terrible meaning and usage of the words. Beyond that there is no reason why a person shouldn't find this movie entertaining.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's South Park...of course it's great!,"There's not much else to add to this movie, just that it's one of the funniest things to ever hit the screens.  Naturally it's offensive and abuses the human ears, but that's the South Park charm.  Highlights include Cartman's song about Kyle's mum and Mr. Mackey's song about cuss word alternatives.

The Best Musical Comedy ... Ever!,"This movie, as irreverent, gross, & perverted as it is (well, it is South Park...), is by far the best musical comedy I have ever seen, period!Not only does it have the typical S.P. vulgarity, all told by supposedly innocent third graders. Not only does it have the bizarre characters of Chef, Mr. Garrison, Mr. Hat, Mrs. Brozlovski, and the rest, but it's also a musical! And a thumping good one!I grew up on musicals, my mother being a big fan. I, of course, found them repulsive. But there is a certain pattern, a specific style about musicals, and this film parodies them all! You have the grand opening number, the tender love numbers, the dance numbers, even the flash-card summation montage containing all the bits of the other musical numbers. Anyone who's seen musicals of any type knows these patterns, and here the creators of South Park have them down pat!I laugh outrageously every time I see it. Sure, it's vulgar, but it's vulgarity with proper hysterics and silliness. This is a keeper, highly recommended for pretty much anyone with any sense of humor (and a willingness to laugh at yourself ... these guys insult pretty much everyone).10 out of 10!Barky",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Blame Canada!,"This is probably the only situation where I would say that the movie is better than the TV show. Stan, Cartman, Kenny and Kyle watch a Terrance and Philip movie, and then go around cursing, igniting a war between the United States and Canada.

Whether it's Terrance and Philip's song, Saddam Hussein in bed with Satan, or Winona Ryder's skit, this movie blows everything out of the water.Kyle's mom is possibly the funniest character.

If the show was water the movie would be whisky,"The Southpark movie is pretty good. It is layed out like a musical, and had many catchy (if not raunchy) songs.

Bill Gates.) but on the whole it was like a long episode of the show without the censors.Also I found it ironic that the plot of the movie was based on how americans can take massive amounts of violence in movies as long as they don't say any naughty words. Which is proably why the rating committee wanted to give this movie an NC-17 rating because they slam on them so much. Anyway, very funny, very crude and very entertaning.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Now this is a movie to see,"This movie is not only hilarious, but has an excellent plot and has a great idea which leads to the awesome conclusion. I am a huge fan of South Park, and I watch it every Wednesday and Saturday (and Friday at 11 occasionally). The show is always funny, but the movie takes it much farther.Even though this movie contains much profanity (for which it got the movie in the world record book for the most profanity in a movie) it still has a great point in what the society and government was back in 1999 going into the Millennium year. It shows what real life situations are like, while showing it in a stomach churning way. The movie deserves what I gave it, 10/10 stars.

"Crude, rude and with plenty of non PC laughs.","A set of small town preteens get their ""tiny minds"" corrupted by an unsuitable movie and trigger a series of silly events that lead to war - and perhaps even apocalypse!Told by means of cheap cardboard cut-out animation with only one or two pieces of CGI.There is no way anybody can summit a comedy as silly and out-there as this. You could talk about this Trey Parker film from now until Christmas, but until you have seen it you won't understand the concept or how it all hangs together - or sometimes doesn't.The difference between the (same name) TV series and this film is that they take the joke further (and given that the TV series involved a talking turd - Mr Hanky - that is saying something!) and use more foul language and sexual images. This film takes the view that children using four letter words is funny - a concept only possible in a cartoon.While I haven't read all the reviews most seem to take the view that it is OK to use images of children in this way or at least not to question it. I am not so sure. The crude nature of the cartoon helps of course. If this was done in the manner of the best of Disney animation - although the costs would be astronomical! - then we would hear more about it.The No.1 rule of silly comedy being that there is no No.1 rule. You can go anywhere - even Hell! - and do anything. The targets are Canadians, dopey school teachers, overprotective parents, homeless people, world leaders and the off-beat folks that hang around in a ""redneck little town.""For reasons that maybe have something to do with the time it was being made Saddam Hussian is taken as dead - presuming that American's thought he soon would be? - and forms a homosexual relationship with the devil. Who he runs rings around. They make a highly comic couple.(The film was banned in Iraq when it came out - they even issued a statement as funny as anything on the screen! Is it now unbanned?)The really interesting part of this movie is that is uses mock old time show tunes to tell the story. The juxtaposition of this style of music being used in such a crude environment works for easy laughs - although only the unbelievable Uncle F***** song stays with you afterwards. I laugh just thinking about it.(Canadians Terrence and Philips might be the funniest cartoon characters of all time. Despite being the cause of all the trouble we don't see enough of them.)Yes there is a bit of a South Park's Greatest Hits about the thing and famous faces crop up to have the mickey taken out of them. The part with Wyonna Ryder at the war rally was the funniest thing I have seen in years. A real jaw dropper.The only thing is that it goes on too long for what it is. The laughs tend to slow down as the film draws to its silly end-of-days conclusion. It doesn't hold together as drama, but a series of scenes that are either funny or not funny. The George Clooney hospital part (voiced by the man himself) is one of the flops.Let us hope they now know the joke is over and we don't have a South Park II.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

This film sets out to shock you in the first few minutes and the swearing flies fast and furious - we're talking language that would make a sailor blanch.  In addition, there are some themes that they could never touch on the TV.Cursing aside, Parker and Stone convey an important message in this movie: parents need to spend more time with their kids and know what they're doing, rather than expecting the government to act as a babysitter with ever encroaching legislation (at least that's what I gather they were doing).Even diehard fans will tire of all the musical numbers (Sound of Music this ain't) but nonetheless they will probably enjoy this film.

Unbelievable filth -- and absolutely brilliant,"Ordinarily I try to avoid gratuitous obscenity, but in this movie it is a necessary and integral part of the story.Between laughing, I must admit to watching in frequent open-mouthed admiration at some of the brilliant ideas.This cartoon presents several levels of ideas, including, as strange as it might seem to anyone turned off by the language, some rather profound philosophical notions.Having once resided in North (brrrr) Dakota, I always get a kick out of jokes about Canada (it's not really a country, you know) and Canadians, who seem to love their socialized medicine but come south to the States to buy their groceries and liquor and tobacco so as to avoid the obscenely high taxes that pay for all the ""free"" ""services"" from the Canadian government. (And frequently they come for the more readily available medical care.)In fact, one of my favorite jokes came from a waitress in a restaurant in Grand Forks, N.D.: What is the difference between a Canadian and a canoe? A canoe might tip. (It's a joke very popular in Florida, too.)All of which might seem to have nothing to do with this movie, but deep down ... it seems to have nothing to do with this movie.Anyway, I loved ""South Park,"" and try to catch the nightly replays of the TV show.Not every show is a gem, but often enough there is a spark of brilliance that I must express my admiration and respect for its creators, and especially for this longer, uncut, and uncensored movie.Not for the squeamish, as the cliché goes, and certainly not for the easily offended, but it is for anyone who can appreciate an inventive story and some really exceptional music.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Scathing attack of a movie observing how one nation's work infiltrates another's quiet, innocent existence with issues of censorship and spectatorship at the forefront.","It's somewhat peculiar that the feelings and notions linked to the build up to initially watching South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut many years ago would go so far as to actually contribute to the themes and ideas that the film itself is looking at. Here is a film that everybody it was meant for, as well as those that it wasn't, just had to see at some point in their lives. For those that couldn't, we had to wait until it was released in the latter days of the video cassette and hope to have it bought for us; either that or have a school-mate, whose ill-informed-on-the-matter parents had been easily fooled by the cover's cartoonish qualities and central positioning of four young and smiling children complete with all Hell breaking loose in the background, lend it to us.The cartoon series hadn't been around long, but it'd been around long enough to garner the sort of attention its creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, would have both wanted and expected. Of course, I found the film hilarious the first time I saw it; it was the sort of humour anyone my age would have done, but as the years have gone by and I've watched it ever-so often since; the screenplay and the various situations that play out are still as funny, as the greater study that the film observes unfolds around it, all the time under a huge umbrella of self-awareness and send ups. There must be people other than myself that still evoke a chuckle at scenes such as the one in which a character's mother's televised debate with an angry Canadian individual gets rather heated, as well as a U.S. general's debriefing before a coming together with Microsoft's Bill Gates as they talk of how frustrating it is to work with Windows '98.The film is absolutely shameless in its opening: a crude and somewhat tame looking establishing shot of something that in any other film, particularly animated, would fill us with awe; that being a mountain range. We zoom out of this badly drawn and uninspiring looking peak to the town of South Park in Colorado, U.S.A. and Stan, one of many characters voiced by Trey Parker, partaking in a spoof-rendition of the opening of 1991's Beauty and the Beast as he observes his home town. It's a poignant start to a film which is, essentially, all about this young boy and his observations of the world and, ultimately, the art around him. If everything established is perfect in this Utopian setting, then it is only by way of an outside agent that anything can interfere. One such line from Stan's opening song sees him remark on the one negative aspect of his town; that ""you see homeless people, but you just don't care"". The important thing here is that by the end of the film, indeed the journey, Stan will still observe, but will come to care about the things that make something less than perfect, and he will learn to have opinions on the observations he makes.The film predominantly revolves around censorship, in particular the want to censorship an art form of some-kind. In South Park's case, a patched together Canadian comedy film about two individuals called Terrance and Phillip indulging in nothing but a series of low-brow gags. Naturally, the new 'event' movie sees the four kids of South Park; named Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman; go along to see the latest release from yonder-border – with horrific results. The film opens up all sorts of problems for the boys and shortly after the cinema visit, they're swearing and cursing like nobody's business. The mothers' reaction sees a campaign for a banning order followed by an actual war with Canada when they apprehend Terrance and Phillip.Amongst all the chaos and the jokes, it's difficult to loose sight of what the film actually does; that being a coming of age tale which explores the importance of spectatorship and viewer awareness when it comes to film. The real life connotations linked to the fact a number of people under the age of who it's for wanted 'in' on the Soth Park film unearths an eerie sense of art echoing life. The sneaking in and the observing of the film causes a war between two nations, whereas one character attempts to re-create what he's seen characters do on screen only for him to orrifically perish as a result, in what is a clear demonisation of this notion. Later on, Cartman will go off into a song number in which he will churn out a number of offensive and racist jibes, much in the vein of the Terrance and Phillip movie, in what is a further demonisation when it transpires he then has some sort of anti-swear hardware installed into him.But the boys mean good overall, they're just caught in a wave with the rest of the herd. They each share the same idol; an American figure skater named Brian Boitano, an athlete of sorts, whom to them embodies all the necessary positive characteristics of dedication and enthusiasm to win through in the end. Additionally, as an overall study, the film is in support of standing up for what you believe in and promotes individualism in regards to specific subject matter. In this regard, the character of Stan is used for such a message. But its outgoing statement on censorship as a bad thing, and that art is to be viewed as it should be, I have no problems with. The film explores these notions by way of presenting the parents of these children as ill-informed and unaware of what their children are watching, just as they allow them to roam the streets in what was already established by one mother as a would-be ludicrously safe-haven in which nothing can go wrong.

"so gross, so extravagant, so enjoyable","For the ones who have never heard about the cult series ""South Park"" and if you don't know what you're going to watch, don't expect a product from the Disney firm! On the other hand, if you're familiar with this series which was extremely popular at the dusk of the nineties in the USA but also in France, then you're going to be rejoiced by its contents. I must admit that before watching this black diamond, I had watched some installments of ""South Park"" and was both deeply amused and shocked.So, in the wake of the triumph of the series, its creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone could only produce its movie and one thing is sure: they must have had a tremendous time penning it and the amount is highly exhilarating. Just have a look at the wacky and a little join-the-dots story (the second epithet is not meant pejoratively). Cartman, Stan, Kyle and the ill-fated Kenny managed to go to the movies to watch a film rated ""R"" because it's filled with filthy language and coarse actions. This screening had a big influence on them and reproduce this language to their pals. As it was expected, their parents and especially their mothers are scandalized. An organization of meetings, discussions could lead to the death sentence of Terrence and Philip but also to a world war. It's all the more serious as the devil flanked by his egoistic lover Saddam Hussein contemplates to conquer and dominate the whole world.This summary of the story is incomplete. It would take a few more paragraphs to assess its contents. But it's nearly a mainspring for the authors of the series to deliver a scathing critic of the puritan, right-thinking America ready to behave in a reactionary way when their values, customs are challenged. But Trey Parker and Matt Stone have more than one string to their bows. Why not letting the faults, sickening aspects of America show through? And the targets are numerous, either it is for instance the army or the American families, institutions. It's partly on these points that ""South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut"" draws a devastating strength. But it would be nearly a crime to pass over in silence what makes this animation film both so gross and so enjoyable: filthy language galore, black humor as one could wish (""Kenny we have replaced your heart with a potato!""), a story which becomes more and more extravagant and I wonder whether the sequence when a doctor announces he has found a treatment to stop children to tell swearwords and experiences it on poor Cartman isn't a spoof of ""a Clockwork Orange"" (1971)...The authors' intentions were perfectly fulfilled with this film. Here willing intentions gave a highly rumbustious, exquisitely offending gem which won't cater for all tastes. The viewers who hate being shocked, you'd better turn away from it and I wouldn't recommend the film to children at all or otherwise as Parker and Stone said: ""parents have to decide themselves whether their children are mature enough to watch the film"".",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
full of foul language and... singing??,"The boys from South Park get to speak their minds without Comedy Central's bleep for the naughty words. It is absolutely hysterical, with most of the humor being found in that they know not what they say, yet they are emulating their heroes and are thus happy. This is a stinging satire of the state of affairs in many homes across the US. Some of the language is iffy and made me feel that this should have been an NC-17 movie.However, with all the singing, you might think you wandered into a very crude Broadway play. Less singing and more humor would make this the ""movie of the summer.""",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

This movie kicked serious a**,"How in the hell did this movie make the R rated cut surprises the hell out of me.  I saw it last week and I am still dying laughing at it.  Parker and Stone did an excellent job, and the musicals were great. If you are going to go see this you definitely must go when it is packed.  The whole theatre was singing and clapping along when Cartman was singing ""the bitch song"" which made it an even better experience.  Warning though this is mainly a movie for high school seniors, college students and kids who have fake ID's. Well worth having to pay full price since I forgot to bring the college student I.D.  Racial jokes, sexual innuendos,  neverending cursing, making fun of canada, and the shooting of the most hated man in the world (not sadaam or satan) if you have seen the movie you know who I mean, and you get to see what Kenny looks like.

One of the best movies ever,"I read some reviews on this page and I think many people don't see the true meaning of this movie. Many people are offended by the strong language in the movie, or they don't think it is funny. They only see this. But the movie is about something different. It is about the ridiculous censorship in America. In Holland we don't have this kind of censorship, u can say whatever u want on national tv.

Profanity at It's Finest and Humor and It's Brilliance,"I'm not one for vulgarity or profanity but this film truly made me laugh my ass off. The profanity and the almost constant swearing really make this movie worth a lot of laughs and amusement. The storyline follows the four friends as they see a vile Canadian film (Terrance & Phillip: Asses of Fire) and they start using various swears and insults that were used in the film. It comes to a boiling point were they push Kyle's mom to the point of raging war, literally, on Canada.There are several things that make this work. First, the obvious, classic style in which the cartoon is presented, only this time bigger, longer and uncut. Second, they turned the profanity into a show stopping musical. Who but Trey and Matt could take the counselor's catch phrase *m'kay * into a musical number, or even the *Viva Le Revolution* song. The swearing and the insults are so overdone and completely unnecessary it's funny, just funny, the whole ""raging war on Canada,"" something that is completely random but not too distant. There are points within the movie were, if it weren't for the cartoon feel, it could have been a serious drama or horror.Also, they took the old cut-out felt and reworked it into more detailed backgrounds and the use of computer generated backgrounds and creaters. The fact that Americans consider anything that happens to celebrities a National Tragedy such as, in the movie, Canada bombs the Baldwin Brothers and the Nation is in shock. The relationships that the characters have with each other are priceless. The homosexual relation that Satan and Saddam have is hysterical and the ""kid-next-door-love"" that Stan has for Wendy is something we can all relate to. The songs, I can't stop bragging about, are very intoxicating. For example: ""Blame Canada,"" ""Mountain Town,"" ""Hell Isn't Good,"" ""What Would Brian Boitano Do?"" and ""La Resistance.""The satire is priceless. That is pretty much the whole movie, satire piled on satire, but what also makes this movie is that, like every other South Park episode, there is a theme that everyone can learn from. It teaches real-life lessons that kids and adults can learn from, however, the kids can learn it from someplace else. I recommend this movie to those who seek brilliant humor and potty humor, but those who are too uptight for this movie, stay way from it. I enjoyed it immensity and I don't usually go for movies like this.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Swearing makes the world go round.,"Whether it's something to be worried about or not, I don't know, but American live-action films rarely emulate the wit, invention and versatility of their animated counterparts.  Even so-called lesser efforts like HERCULES are magesterial compared to bloated Hollywood extravaganzas and enervating indies.  The best of the modern live-action films, such as RUSHMORE, owe much to the freewheeling ethic of cartoons such as THE SIMPSONS.All of which is to say that SOUTH PARK is easily one of the best films of the year.  Again, I don't know whether this is a good thing.  One truth is self-evident: it shows up the bow-legged unfunniness of most 'comedies'.  I was a bit worried going in because the second series of the TV show showed signs of desperation and flagging ideas, but this was a hoot.  I nearly choked on my sweets, and twice spat my drank on the person in front.Its pleasures are many, but most satisfying of all is its consistent adaptation of a young boy's world-view.  The satire of THE SIMPSONS would be way over Bart's head, but everything here is exactly how a Cartman would see the world.  Everything is flat and two-dimensional; noise and immediate sensation predominate; cartoon (!) violence and swearing are joyous pleasures; the efflatus of modern life is only half-gasped (homosexuality, oncoming puberty, Sadaam Hussein is the devil's lackey etc.); and, most importantly, mothers are the cause of all the trouble in the world, their domestic tyranny transposed to a global scale.  And yet this focus does not limit the film's blistering, savage satire, anymore that Lemuel's point-of-view softens Gulliver's Travels.The moral of the film is perversely reassuring.  Swearing makes the world go round.  This isn't just a facile rubbing of conservative noses (although the thought of this is very pleasing) - the idea that the socialisation of children only leads to emotional damage and social chaos is one with a long and noble history.  The annoying thing about this film is its pompous arrogance - if you agree with the film-makers, cool; if you don't, you're a reactionary lunatic.  The great thing about the film is that it belongs to no-one.  Everyone is offended, crucially: though censorship is ridiculed, viewers are shown to be influenced by what they watch; though army racism is attacked, one of the black characters still talks like an extra from GONE WITH THE WIND.  No-one is ever allowed to feel comfortable - conservatism and political correctness are shown to be cosy bedfellows.And yet, the truth is that, despite exposure to 'offensive' material, and potentially traumatic experience, the children remain blissfully innocent. The film's achievement is to show that a set of signifiers (e.g. swearing, obscure female body parts) are of little effect unless they are accompanied by the knowledge to use them practically.  Cartman and co. get fun from swearing because they know it annoys their elders, not because they're offering conscious transgression.Formally, the film is much more graceful than you might expect.  The big screen is perfect - the prodigious detail of SOUTH PARK  is often lost on TV.  The colours and 'simplistic' animation are a constant delight, both comically and aesthetically.  The musical numbers are hilarious and clever in themselves, but also brilliantly choreographed - this is the best Hollywood musical since CABARET.  There is a stunningly conceived and very frightening vision of hell (beware Hitler!  George Burns!  Gandhi!  Jar Jar Binks!), which is immediately sent up.  The climactic battle is a model of crowd composition and meaningful imagery.  The pace, while it never matches the stunning opening and Terrence and Phillip film sequence, rarely flags.What SOUTH PARK will be remembered for, though, is its sidesplitting, offensive, how-the-hell-did-they-get-away-with-that sequences of genius (and it's really tiresome hearing blase bores saying 'What's shocking about it?' Name one film in your local multiplex one tenth as daring): Terrence and Phillip's sublime 'Uncle' song; the Satan and Sadaam relationship; Kyle on the Net; Cartman's V-chip; Mr. Mackay's rehab group; Big Gay Al's show for the boys - they just keep on coming, we can't stop laughing.  One quibble - for all its gratuitous swearing, there is one epithet that even Parker and Stone can't seem to handle.  I wonder why.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"One of the best comedies overlooked for it's vulgarity, which hides a valuable lesson inside","You'd be surprised to know that it's not a Michael Moore movie that shows us how America is with obscenity and language, but an animated film version of Comedy Central's ""South Park"" where creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone give a huge middle finger up to the MPAA, who is one of the many vulnerable targets in this outrageous comedy.There is no need for a plot summary since it's done on the main page. If you haven't seen the show, or any of Parker and Stone's other movies, you'll be in for a big surprise for better or worse. These two show the horrible truth (and aren't afraid to either) of how our kids today really talk, and how the parents deal with it. Films like this that are often overlooked mostly because the parents can't take the hard truth or do anything about it.This movie is a musical of course, with many memorable songs, and a well thought out satire, which prays on everything there is (gays, blacks, language, Canada, etc.) and many others (Bill Gates, Winona Ryder, Saddam Hussein, etc.) It's the movies like this that will always be remembered for its brilliance, but also for it vulgarity, which goes far beyond any movie or show (even their's) out now.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Hilarious if you can see past the offensiveness,"I must start off by warning parents and anyone who is offended easily that this movie earns it's R rating and then some.  There were a few times during the movie where I think that they may have gone a little too far, even for a die hard fan like myself.  However, no matter how offensive the movie got it was able to only have me rolling in the floors but also made some very valid points.  It was also refreshing to see a short animated show taken to a full length feature film without loosing any of the shows charm.  Overall, it was a very entertaining film that truly shows the creators wit and style.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Yes, get ready to have your minds warped","Am a fan of 'South Park', more so the earlier seasons than later. Initially thought before getting into it that it wouldn't be my cup of tea at all, but it ended up right up my street despite not being for the easily offended. And to be honest, it is very easy to see why 'South Park' won't be for all tastes and why its humour is controversial.Had heard nothing but good things about 'South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut', how great it was and how it did justice to the show in a way that few films based on series do (there are some disastrous ones out there). Seeing it, couldn't agree more with the acclaim and can see why people often put it on their favourite animated films lists (it's close to being on mine, and goes down as the boldest and one of the funniest). It absolutely does justice to the show and is every bit as good as it, and a fond reminder of the show in its prime years.It is perfect for fans, and also does a fantastic job at having enough to attract a wider audience, one of the few series-to-film translations to do so.Sure, some of the animation is crude and less than refined. Otherwise 'South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut' is difficult to criticise. Considering that the humour is controversial and normally bad taste doesn't bode well with me ('Freddy Got Fingered' for example is an incredibly tasteless film, and in such a gratuitous, disturbing and unfunny way that it's on my worst films list), but it's wholly dependent on how the lack of taste is handled, whether it's handled wittily and cleverly. 'South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut' is one such film.Was really surprised at how tuneful the songs were, some of the best actually of any animated film to not have Disney's name on it and perhaps some of the best songs of any musicals of the past 20 years. ""Up There"", ""Wendy's Song"" and ""Hell isn't Good"" are standouts. The story execution worked brilliantly too, it has its poignant moments and some truthful and relevant messaging that makes its point without being over the top. It doesn't feel padded or like an extended episode of the show, actually opening up the concept to something bigger and bolder. It's also an ambitious story, but the ambition doesn't get in the way of the execution, one ends up admiring the ambition and the execution.Like the show itself, a lot of the content is very controversial and not for the easily offended. is crude, extremely rude (every bit as much as 'Team America'), naughty, at times juvenile, often vulgar and less than subtle in its treatment of taboo subjects. At the same time, 'South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut', again like 'South Park', is hilarious, smart, witty and bold but also clever, sharp, irreverent and intelligent. The satirical humour is subversive and there are not many animated films this daring, risk-taking or bold and doing it in a way that doesn't feel like it's trying too hard. Completely contradicting the tired and incredibly annoying cliché spouted constantly that animation is only for children (often by parents defending a panned family film).Often one is shocked at how much the film, like the show, gets away with, which feels like almost everything. Every subject and every everyday issues is covered and satirised it seems, nothing escapes the writers. While subtlety completely goes out the window, so much of what 'South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut' says has a huge amount of truth and relevance. Like good satire should it does it in a daring and perhaps divisive fashion, not holding back and taking no prisoners. This should sound like a recipe for disaster, but actually to me it was why the show is so loved and admired and why the film has just as much appeal.Before one forgets, the characters are some of the most memorable and iconic in recent animation, especially Cartman. Trey Parker and Matt Stone's voice work is a practical tour-De-force for both, both bringing so much individuality and personality to these characters and their writing. The regrettably late Mary Kay Bergman and Isaac Hayes also delight.Overall, brilliant, as a representation of 'South Park' and as a film in general. Just know what you're letting yourself in for before watching. It's animated satire at its finest and bad taste has never been funnier. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Incredible,"Nothing you have seen prepares you for this ride: if you have religious beliefs, if you belong to some ethnical minority, if you are just plain idiot or if you are just a human being, don't see this, for its mix of satire and gags, born in the heart of the series from which it was made, is the ultimate nerve-test. Offensive, soft-pornographic, ridiculously funny, and funnily ridiculous, this movie marks the ultimate ceiling in the world of hardcore comedy. But South Park has a section for itself, and this makes this movie a must-see in all aspects. A hit for everyone who's willing to accept it with a smile. My favorite is the relationship between Satan and Saddam Hussein: genius! the musical bits (and the satire to musical bits in movies) give it a fresh look and prevent the viewer from seeing a hour-and-a-half-long episode. A great movie, with a sense of humor which nothing else has, and original-to-the-end gags and lines.And for every kid who puts the ""cute"" main characters in their Nokias or their wallpapers: THIS IS NOT FOR KIDS - WATCH IT WHEN YOU'RE 18.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the Funniest Films of All Time!,Let me start off by saying that anyone that hasn't seen this movie should see right now don't sit here and read this go watch RIGHT NOW!!!!! this is quite possibly one of the funniest movies ever made Anyone who wants to say that this movie should banned or whatever has never seen it. NOT EVERYONE CARES WHAT YOU THINK!!!!! You have no right to say what people should and shouldn't watch. So watch this movie and learn the lesson it tries to teach you if you would give it a chance. But it's really funny I highly recommend that every single person in the world to see it. When I saw it in the theater there many points in the movie where everyone was laughing so loud that you by the time you've finished laughing at one joke you've missed like 3 or 4 others.,9.0,Anonymous,Animation
movie reflects life,"I was a bit surprised I liked the movie as well as I did.  I never really went out of my way to see the tv show, and while I suppose it beats MASH re-runs, I never considered myself a fan.  The movie, on the other hand, is very well executed.  For obvious reasons, the media lumps South Park in with all the so-called ""gross out"" comedies, but there is a detail to craftsmanship here that is easy to overlook . . . things like good comic timing, good parody (I'm thinking primarily of the songs here), a whole range of funny bit players, all well-realized, etc.  And, while the movie can be quite offensive, it is never mean-spirited (rule #1: if you're going to offend somebody, best offend everybody).  While it may be tempting to read too much into the social commentary of the film (on that level, the movie is shallow & banal), the commentary nevertheless provides a framework for Parker & Stone to riff on.  While this isn't Duck Soup or Dr Strangelove, it still is a cut above ""gross out"" movie status (especially Something About Mary, a movie I deplore).Interesting side note: I saw this movie the week it opened.  There had already been a substantial amount of publicity surrounding the obscenity, coupled with the national crackdown on ids for R-rated movies.  I was carded when I bought the tickets, which was a little strange, considering I'm 38 years old, and the person checking my id was maybe 16.  I look a little young for my age, but not even close to 17.  The woman who went to the movie with me neglected to bring her id (she's 29; she didn't figure she'd need it).  The ticket taker wasn't going to allow her into the theater until I volunteered that I was her legal guardian.  The manager was called; she said ""it was highly unlikely"" that I was this woman's legal guardian.  I very politely pointed out that it was as likely as the woman being under 17 in the first place.  The manager finally decided to let us both in, making clear that she was risking her job to do so.  That was the first time I had been carded for a movie in 17 years . . . .",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

I could tell there was an idea (albeit a good, and timely one) evident, but it just boils down to ""I don't like South Park.""

"If you don't like this movie, you clearly missed the point!...","People!...For those of you who say ""All this movie is about is bad words, anybody could make this movie""....think again!  YOU are partly the reason why this movie is found so funny by others, those with brains and a knowledge of how society works, that is.To make it as basic as possible, this movie is about how hypocritical society is when it comes to bad language.  Society can show wars and porn 24/7 as entertainment, but you better not say a bad word on TV or radio!  If you didn't realize that about the movie, there's no chance in Saddam's hell that you will find it funny!  And if you didn't realize it, perhaps you should stick to watching ""2 Fast 2 Furious""!  If you get the point, this movie is beyond hilarious, perhaps the best musical-comedy ever.On a side note, I originally went to see this movie in the theater with a friend who had a brother with mental issues.  I was constantly distracted trying to get him to keep quiet and also continually returning to the candy stand for him.  So when I seen it the 1st time, I didn't understand the plot, and I thought it was horrible too.  I thought it was one of the worst movies ever seen at the time, so I understand where some of the people who hate this movie are coming from....and they are coming from the group who didn't get the point, obviously!  Because I went a 2nd time, this time with my girlfriend who didn't know I went to it without her and I couldn't object to seeing it because I was a big South Park fan....and I absolutely loved it, one of the best movies I've ever seen.

"South Park:Bigger, Longer and Uncut.  I guess you know what to expect!","If you need to laugh, then this is the movie for you.  Not being a MASSIVE fan of the South Park series, I didn't really follow the progress of this film, nor did I get excited about it when I heard it was in production.  A mate came up to me and said, ""Lets go see the South Park Movie tomorrow."" I agreed.  I did not know what to expect, but as soon as the Warner bros logo dissapeared and we were left with a crappy cardboard cut out of a mountain, I laughed till the end.  This film needs to be congratulated.  The way it offends EVERYONE.  Not just some groups, ALL Groups!  Especially the way it takes on Disney with all the musical numbers included.  The lyrics to most songs, you will be humming to yourself for weeks to come.The plot is very basic, just like the animation. the 4 boys sneak into an R rated film featuring their favourite actors.  Afterwards, they start swearing in the most offensive ways possible.  The parents blame Canada, and hence a war is started between the two countries.The film takes a look at how our ratings system is going down hill, and how parents don't care about ratings.  They just care about how the film could be banned from being released.  I think it has an important message with regards to this ratings war, which is always going on.To create an animated film is very difficult.  To create an animated film from a television series, and actually have it work is even more difficult. Trey Parker and Matt Stone have done a great job.

Don't like South Park? - This may change your mind!,"I'll admit, I don't like South Park, it's pretty infantile, and has very few redeeming features apart from the fact that they are prepared to infantilely approach, or attack, any topic.And it's this care-free and care-less approach which makes this movie a winner. They've managed to create a plot that's large enough to remain coherent for the length of the film, rather than just pasting vignette after vignette together haphazardly.Don't analyse it - don't look for anything deep - just view it for fun, which is the spirit for which it was intended. If you do that, then you will hopefully realise that a few of the infantile jokes actually do have some kernel of meaningful social comment in them after all.I revisited the TV series after seeing this film, hoping that some of the insight into the characters would help me appreciate the shorts. It didn't much at all - they're still annoying. The film stands out above the series, so put any prejudice aside, and give it a go.

Although the idea for a ""South Park"" movie probably came about before the idea to exploit the MPAA's more flexible ratings system for the TV show's impeccable satire, it's no less the perfect choice to bring the little Colorado mountain town and its foul-mouthed children to the big screen in ""South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut.""Using the movies, Parker and Stone immediately come out singing (yes, this is a movie musical) that the movies are responsible for society's cultural education. The third graders Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny all go to see the new Terrence & Philip movie, based on the show's fictional hit Canadian TV show about two farting roommates, mirroring the experience of the likely underaged crowd going to see the ""South Park"" movie, and there you have the brilliance of ""South Park"" and this film.The Terrence & Philip movie introduces the kids to a whole world of swears and insults they never knew before (because they couldn't use them on TV) and they start using it in talking back to teachers and their parents. As usual, the parents of South Park take things too seriously and point the finger for their children's bad behavior at well, Canada, who else? Single-handedly, Parker and Stone introduce the Canada joke to Americans.The film doesn't crusade for allowing bad language, but rather shows how silly it is to take language so seriously, particularly when Mothers Against Canada invokes a war with our neighbors to the north.Parker and Stone should take their act to Broadway with the quality of the music in this movie, from the Oscar-nominated ""Blame Canada"" to ""What Would Brian Boitano Do?"" They do enlist the help of the talented Tony winner Marc Shaiman, but the show has always been known for its musical prowess. The songs are memorable, fun and break up the film well considering its structured like a long television special.Fans of the show get exactly what they'd expect from ""South Park"" including some extra goodies and appearances from all the most liked characters. The language of course is off the charts, but the childish ignorance of adult content (Stan seeks the clitoris after Chef tells him that's how you keep a girl around) is there too. By film's end it's not the sharpest satire that the show has ever delivered, but it was obviously the perfect plot choice for making ""South Park"" into a movie, not just picking some random story line, but maximizing the satire potential of the new medium. ~Steven C Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Only stupid people won't get this movie.,"I have heard comments saying that this movie is nothing but bathroom humor, but unlike certain movies (i.e. White Chicks, Soul Plane, etc.) this movie has some of the smartest comedy from the year it was in theaters. The issue Trey Parker and Matt Stone take on is the evils of censorship and how parents should be watching their kids about what they see on television or a movie theater. Trey Parker and Matt Stone also put in lots of low-brow humor, but unlike most movies attempting this kind of humor, they are actually very successful. This movie pulls absolutely no punches whatsoever on one of the most serious issues in our country. People might complain that it will eventually be dated, but censorship has actually gotten a lot worse than it was back in 1999 and sees no sign of dying. What impressed me about the movie the most was that it was also a damn good musical, in fact, better than almost any musical from the decade this movie was released. If censorship does die eventually, it could possibly be used for historical purposes, just like what Looney Tunes did for World War II. All in all, this movie is a brilliant combination of witty and low-brow comedy, with some heavy issues that this country has right now. If you are into satirical, smart, sharply written comedy, you will absolutely love this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A great, vulgar movie","The movie/musical begins with the four boys (Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman) going to the local theatre to see a foreign film by Terrance and Phillip (a Canadian duo famous for their ""hilarious"" fart jokes). Only to find out that they're not allowed entrance as it is rated R. Being the resourceful little chaps that they are, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman hire a bum and have him pose as their parent. They get into the movie, hear a whole slew of fowl language, Kenny dies from imitating the movie, Kyle's mom starts a war on Canada, and Satan and Saddahm Hussein are preparing to rule the world. Weird, huh? The movie is probably the most perfect thing I've ever seen, ranging from it's satirical humor to it's mindless knockoffs of song cues from the likes of Disney, to it's cast of characters and voice acting. This is one of the greats. As with all of the South Park episodes, this movie has a moral hidden deep down inside for parents and children alike. Mom and dad, if your son or daughter is doing drugs, hanging around with the wrong people, joining cults, or imitating violence seen off of video games and t.v., watch this movie, and find out the REAL cause for all of your troubles with your children.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"If you only heard cursing, then you weren't paying attention.","After reading through about 8-9 pages of reviews for this movie, the majority of people seem to love it, and only a bare few hate it because of the ""mindless"" ""overdone"" ""unnecessary"" profanity in the movie.  And it's these people who should pay the most attention, because they are the types that Parker and Stone are aiming at.To answer those who ask ""How in the world did this movie get nominated for an Oscar?"" the answer is simple - it managed to grab the attention of the movie public, and it dared to make a statement in and of itself.  The Academy likes movies like that.  The cursing was a tool to make a statement, nothing more.  The creators of South Park are all for the 1st amendment, but the point they were trying to show is that there are worse things in this world than bad language - violence, war, racism, and Wynona Rider.  What would you rather have your own kids caught up in?The movie also makes a great case for anti-censorship.  We live in a country that provides us with the right to choose to see what we want at the movies, read what we want in a bookstore, etc.  However, when one parent (like Kyle's mom) decides that something isn't fit for her son, which is HER right to monitor her son's activities, said parent will spread opinion to others and try to ban the movie or book in question.  Thus, they take away the rights of others to see or read whatever is being banned without being given he choice.  And so toes are getting stepped on, and bad things happen.  As in this movie, an all out war breaks out.So to those with sensitive ears, look a little closer, and see what's happening behind the foul language.  You'll see why this movie stands out in its politics.  Besides, you might even laugh a little as well.  It is a comedy after all.",,Anonymous,Animation

"Nasty, crude, vulgar but funny!!!","I love it! It was so funny! First, the boys from the movie were watching a canadian R-rated movie (Terrence and Phillip: Asses of fire), a very vulgar movie with explicit contents. And then, all the american youngsters watched it and they all spoke like the guys Terrence and Phillip from the movie. So, all the american parents blame Canada and make war! In Hell, Satan with his ""boyfriend"" Saddam Hussein were planning to take over the world, but only if the blood of Terrence and Phillip touched the ground.It's a pretty nice musical comedy, maybe some people don't like it, especially canadians and irakis. Sometimes, i feel that the movie is going too far for the jokes like Saddam Hussein is a gay, Wynnona Ryder's show...But that's OK! The songs are nice too:""Blame Canada"",""Uncle Fucka"", ""Kile's mom is a bitch"" (I think that one is the funniest song of the movie), ""I'm super""(performed by Big A Gay, the video is copying Beauty and the Beast's ""Be our guest""'s one), ""What would Bryan Boitano do""...That movie may be inappropriate for children but it wanna show how children see things, how adult see things and it is against war!~You must see it!!! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Surprising,"Although I was used to hearing really bad broadway-style songs on the tv show, I didn't expect the film to be an all-out musical. The numbers were quite good, and some of the composition was actually very good. For instance, listen for the battle scene where the songs from earlier are mixed together. I had the tunes in my head for weeks. Believe it or not, the animation seemed better to me in the film than in the tv show. Watch for the flames especially.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

It touches all the things going on in the world at that time such as Saddam Housein and the love of War.

Brilliant (hehe) satire of a Disney animated musical,"Stan, Eric, Kyle, and Kenny go to see the movie Asses of Fire, and as a result, learn to curse.  Such is the beginning of a movie which, besides being extremely fulfilling to its hardcore fans, also surprised some people with its wit and musical genius.  The movie could easily make it onto a list of the ten best animated (American) movies.  As a musical, it works well. As a comedy, it is hilarious.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
No disappointment for the TV fans,"I was a little worried before I went that South Park couldn'ttake the transformation into a full-time movie. But it could. As a Swede - you know how slutty we are! :) - I've always foundthe American Redneck values and the moral aspects of filmcensoring a bit confusing. People have sex. Big deal. People saynasty things. Big deal again. Since when did words hurt anyone?The worst thing that could happen is that the kids start usingthe words themselves. Scary. South Park as a phenomenon fights the lying, oversweet ""7thHeaven"" way to look at kids. Stan's song in the beginning of thefilm is hilarious in its parody of musicals. (I love musicals.I'm also quite fond of Winona and at least one of the Baldwins.That only makes it funnier.) When Kyle's mom is ready to keep up a bloody war and let Satanand Saddam take over the world rather than let the f-word sayersTerrance and Phillip go free, her son in a simple speech tellsher what the film is all about. It's smart. It's true. It'sdangerously close to sentimental all-American apple sauce.Kyle's mom listens - and kills T&P anyway. The point with this show is a lot like the animation: it maylook crude, but if you take a good look at it you find it's alot neater and harder to do than impersonal disneyfications ordetailed fantasy book illustrations. Part of me has seen this film the way an over-intellectualcollege student should. But part of me can't deny that ""Uncaf***a"" made me laugh 'til I almost cried.

"Takes incredible risks of comedy and even music, and they all pay off","The SOUTH PARK was the best entry from the ""summer of comedy"" in 1999, when films like AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME, BIG DADDY, AMERICAN PIE, NOTTING HILL, RUNAWAY BRIDE, even WILD WILD WEST all earned huge earnings. Some of those films are good, some are really bad (I'm not going to say which, guess if you want to) but none are in the class of SOUTH PARK: BIGGER LONGER & UNCUT. For a lot of reasons, this is a remarkable movie.One thing that impressed the hell out of me upon repeated viewing of this movie was the mammoth percentage of jokes that were hilarious. I'd guess-timate there were something like 400 jokes in this film over its short running time--dialogue, visual gags, the song numbers--and there were very few jokes were I wasn't laughing and (sometimes) smiling. Considering how much humor Trey Parker & Matt Stone jammed into this film, it's really amazing how much of it is side-splittingly funny and intelligent, as well.That's another thing that I was quietly amazed at: this is a very smart, very perceptive film disguised as an all-time shock and obscenities comedy. It shows better than almost any drama I've ever seen how people can go from understandably reacting to a situation to completely overreacting and end up doing more harm than good. Take Kyle's mom, for example. Is what she does here wrong? By the end, yes, she's gone berserk. But is she wrong to be concerned about the way her child is behaving, about the influences on them? No, because those influences aren't going to be good for Kyle, Stan, or Cartman either. Kyle put it best when he asked his mom not to punish anyone but himself when he does something bad. The sense of self-responsibility for one's actions is a powerful message and it's awesome to see it embedded in an all-out comedy.Add to that the musical numbers, which are raunchy, off-the-wall, and the funniest things in the movie. My favorites were ""Uncle F---a"", ""What Would Brian Boitano Do?"", and the ""La Resistance"" marathon number. The only song that isn't great is Satan's rendition of ""Up There"". It was funny but made points about his desires to be a regular, happy gay man that the film had already expressed. All the other songs were incredible, and if Trey Parker wants a career on Broadway, on the basis of the work here he'll have one.It's said there are greater rewards for greater risks. This movie could have been a watered-down disappointment for loyal fans of the show (like myself) or it could have been an experiment in shock value that didn't keep the elements that make the show great and then didn't translate into a feature-length film, either. What ultimately came about was one of the funniest films ever made, and one of the smartest. It worked on every level it aimed at. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Vulger, obnoxious, and funny as all get out","South Park, has always been rude, crude and very juvenile.  But it was always held back by the TV censors.  Now, Parker and Stone have unleashed their fearsome four on the movie going populace.

But, amid the tirade of foul language, is a satire that makes us examine our own lives.  Do we want v-chips censoring what we say? Do we want what we see, to be monitored by some sort of legislative body that will decide what's good for the mass populace?  I'm sure that there will be a wave of controversy surrounding this movie.  There's always been something to complain about ever since it premiered two years ago.  The movie is not for kids.  It's rated R and if you do decide to take your kid to see it, be prepared to explain a lot of things to them, and I do mean a lot!  Don't go blaming the movie for their foul language that they might pick up, as our four heroes did, blame the lack of parental control.

The music added to the wonderful sense you get from the movie, where a normal person would think ""South Park and musical yeah right what a dumb movie.""This movie would get best musical from me along with best cartoon, and funniest story line.

Brilliant political satire,"Don't let the South Park reputation as a shock-cartoon fool you. Like the TV series, only more so, this is a very astute attack on political and social ""standards"" in the States and beyond. It might be disguised (as one IMDB reviewer puts it) as ""mindless entertainment"" to draw in the crowds, but this is anything but mindless. Targets of bigotry, prejudice, and the dominant social and political order are hit with unerring accuracy; this isn't like 'Wag the Dog'; it's closer in spirit and style to Lindsay Anderson's ""Britannia Hospital"". Amazingly, its constant assaults on its targets aren't scattershot but are part of a coherent point of view.That position is perhaps a little too radical for an audience that wants only to see the latest ""Beavis and Butthead"" incarnation. Alot of the gags could I guess go by without notice. So watch carefully, think about this as more than just some exploiting cartoon. As I said - don't be fooled. Trey Parker is a subtle filmmaker despite the sledgehammer he can use at times.The targets hit are many and varied, and even those who might be expected to be part of the ""resistance"" to the powers that be are mercilessly - but, importantly, accurately, satirised.A small example.

Kyle's mom's a bitch!,"This has to be the most bizarre ""musical"" to ever see a theater screen.Keep in mind that it helps to already be a fan of South Park in order to understand anything that's going on in this film.  Otherwise, it's going to be a mystery and a bit of a shock to the system if you see this film unprepared.THIS IS NOT A CHILDREN'S FILM.  In spite of the cutsie cartoon caricatures, South Park is for adults only... *especially* BL&U.   It contains some seriously harsh dialogue as well as some intense visuals that simply won't appeal to some of the more reserved viewers.It also contains some of the most inspired lunacy and visual sight gags that have ever graced a movie screen.   If you look closely at the entire South Park phenomenon, it becomes evident that there's more to the concept than just a collection of off-color jokes and one-liners and tongue-in-cheek TV and film references.  This is a satirical reflection of the memories and recollections that so many of us remember from our times as a child, and how we looked at the rest of the world.   However, South Park the TV series takes it all to an extreme... or maybe not.  It's a love or hate sport of thing.  You either get a bang out of it or you hate it with a passion. Either way, you won't soon forget it.There's been a lot of controversy over South Park, mostly from people who simply ""don't get it"".   Many of these seem to believe that it's a kid's show and keep condemning it for being such a corrosive influence on ""our children"".  It is not a kid's show.  Others think it's simply a vehicle for Parker and Stone to launch onto the viewing public with jokes and one-liners that in a live action series would get it cancelled in a week.  In fact, there has indeed been some concerted efforts to get South Park cancelled, which is partly to blame (or thank, depending on your viewpoint) for ""South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"" of which the title itself could well be a take-off on the fact that one of the  South Park kids (Stan) is Jewish... which also is no sacred cow, far as the unfolding events are concerned. Nobody is safe.  Canadians, Germans, and French appear to be Prime Targets in South Park along with almost any organized religious, political, or ethnic group.However:""It is not prejudiced as it offends everyone equally.""First, down to the basics.SP: BLU is one of the funniest and most imaginative and over-the-edge films I've ever seen.   You haven't lived until you see Satan singing, A&E musical style, about dreaming of living a wonderful life ""Up There"", or the Academy Award nominated ""Blame Canada"" number, or the outrageous ""Uncle F*cka"" song... which could well end up having you humming it at work in spite of yourself.  It's perhaps the most astonishing song in the film.  And that's saying something.  Besides, you've not lived until you witness a professionally choreographed/performed musical arrangement that includes the sounds of flatulence as part of the lyrics.  It must be seen to be believed. What's more, it actually works.  Amazing...Marvelous fun throughout, for those with an open mind and a taste for the obscure... and aren't bothered with insecurities over how society is being corrupted by the Media... read: South Park.Now, the serious part:""South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut"" actually contains a message.  It's a not very subtle punch to the face of censorship and sensationalism regarding over-reaction to things as inconsequential as bad language vs the numerous and much more serious problems facing the world we all live in.   It's odd that such a message would be overlooked by so many detractors who only see obscenity and gross crude humor as the ""message"".  Either that or they simply chose not to see.Of course, most people went to see this film only to get a belly laugh, rather than experience enlightenment over censorship.  Others seem to have viewed this film for the sole reason of criticizing it.  Their minds were already made up before they bought the ticket.If you already think South Park is a waste of time and sensibility, forget seeing this film.   You've already decided that it's crap.But if you can be objective and you're not bothered by adult humor... and you're not afraid of being ""corrupted"", go see it.  Rent it.  Buy it.  You just might end up finding that your memories of being a child might get jostled a bit.   And it's OK to hum the tune of ""Uncle F*cka"" at work... just don't sing the lyrics.And to those who might take offense at this film... perhaps it's because some of the shots taken at the villains in this movie, whether by direct insult or via metaphor, just might hit a little too close to home.I was not offended.   I went out and bought the DVD.  It's worthy of repeated viewing, in my opinion.  I also have almost 40 hours of South Park episodes on tape.   It's all a great way to escape the rest of the world for a little while on a rainy evening when there's not much doing.Your mileage may vary...  and I do have nomex underwear.

Blame Canada!,"Film adaptations of popular cartoon series rarely match the quality of the series. However, South Park Bigger Longer and Uncut is an exception to the rule.In America the Terence and Philip film is about to be released. All the kids in South Park are looking forward to seeing it and out four heroes, Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny sneak into the cinema to see it. The result is there are shock to hear them use swear words in the film (get the joke?), and results in them swearing at school. This causes a massive moral panic in America led by Kyle's mother. Anti-Canadian feeling run high and Terence and Philip are arrested in America. This leads to a war between the two North American nations, especially when America plan to kill the comedians. In the depths of Hell Satan has fallen into an abusive relationship with the recently deceasted Saddam Hussien. Because of the events of Earth Satan could raise if Terence and Philip are killed on American soil. So this makes issues even more important and Kenny has to warn the boys from beyond the grave.What the TV series does so effectively is mix low brow humour and clever satire. Like a fine wine the show has improved with age. Whilst in most TV film adaption some element that made the show good is lost when its transferred to film. But Bigger, Longer and Uncut doesn't. There are sex jokes, and toilet humour as well as the novelty of swearing. But there are more clever jokes about moral panics (namely having the wrong target), censorship, racism, political apathy and even some parodies of World War 2. I agree with the film that American television does act stupidly, blocking swearing but showing violence deaths: I experienced this in New York City.Basically South Park Bigger Longer and Uncut is a fun film, which honours the show it's based on.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Doesn't Feel Like A Longer Episode.,"I have an odd relationship with South Park. I never watch the show when it is on, yet I own the first two seasons on DVD. I find the show funny, but never watch it consistently enough to get the jokes that my friends make when they refer to an episode. I've never seen the film until now too. I get the appeal it has, but I just never really got into it.The film, as is with any film adaptation from a TV show plays out like a longer episode from the series. This time there is a war against CANADA because of a film that contains foul language. Why a war? Well, the kids are swearing. That is it. The film is basically Matt Stone and Trey Parker's thoughts on the current state of censorship with the MPAA and the films they rate.For a cartoon, yes it has a wide variety of curse words, which are spoken by kids in grade school. There is violence, blood and guts grace the screen in a hospital (with cameo voice acting from George Clooney) and the final war scene between Canada and the States. There is also a bit of nudity, which is their version of heaven.I laughed more at the subtle humour then the in your face bits. I didn't find myself laughing at the language they use which is one of the main draws (damn those young teenage boys who like swear words). There is a smart film here, but when you listen to it, it sounds like it was written to two 15 year old boys who think every bad word is funny.Did I forget to mention it is a musical? The musical numbers are nice and sometimes funny. Hell, one earned an Oscar nomination. Sometimes the humour in the film is so random that it's funny, like a Skeet Ulrich poster above Satan's bed. I don't know who would think up of something like that, but it works.If you're a fan of the show, this film will appeal to you. If not, I would suggest looking elsewhere.

I remember a South Park Christmas episode called ""Mr Hankey's Christmas Special"" where there was 20 minutes of just singing, that was by far the worst South Park episode, in fact it was the only one I could not finish watching due to its awfulness. Just listen to Kyle's mum's singing to know what I mean.Besides that, this movie is brilliant and is definitely worth watching if you're a South Park fan.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
south park sucks,"I really didn't enjoy this movie,I thought the dialogue was sketchy and the singing repetitive. in one word this movie SUCKED, the animation I believe could have been done better by a blind man with no arms. If i was to make a movie i would actually try to make a GOOD movie not a pile of steaming urine that makes fun off both religion and the colour of peoples skin, it uses the same repetitive jokes as the episodes which preceded it.If you want my opinion,DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIEChris",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hilarious to the Extreme!,"""South Park:  Bigger, Longer, and Uncut""... what can I say?  Just saying the name brings a smile to my face.  This movie is so funny you will laugh THROUGH EVERY SCENE!  The animation is 10x better than the cartoon animation on Comedy Central. (of course Season 7's animation is hella better than the movie).  The musical scores are very funny!  I laugh through the one song that Cartman sings called ""Kyle's Mom is a Big Fat B...h"".  That's the funniest song in the movie!  The movie definitely got the R-rating because this movie but ""F"" this and ""S"" that.  They cause more in this movie than they do in ""Scarface""!

Brilliant commentary on American society and parental failure,"I'm really only posting this to boost the over-all rating as much as I can because pretty much everything that's can be said about this movie has been said.In short, it was brilliant in both the story plot, the humor, the music, and really in every way except the blood. I thought the gore was unnecessary, but the profanity was no big deal. It was, after-all, the point of the movie.Personally I find it interesting how they calmed down the main characters for the movie. The four boys are far more ""innocent"" and nice compared to the actual show especially the truly evil Cartman.If you do what I did and watch the movie before any episodes, you'd never know.",,Anonymous,Animation

"Very, very funny","I laughed as much the second time I watched this film, as I did when I watched it the first time.  I had missed so many jokes the first time round as I was trying my best to control myself from vomitting with the giggles. This is a very funny movie. For the people who will watch it and tut, or turn off, or merely be morally outraged by 8 year olds swearing and farting and generally being rude and abusive to anyone they want including each other, then either a) don't watch it again and shut up so the rest of us can enjoy it, or b) get a sense of humour. I am not blinkered enough to realise that this film will not appeal to all whom by it is viewed.  But at least I have enough of an open mind to admit that.  For people who would brand this movie a disgrace (and I have heard a few), please don't be so self-consciously narrow minded as to ignore the fact that it brings pleasure to many others. If I understand the film, of which I do to a basic level at least, it was not designed to be serious, realistic or politically hard hitting.  What isn't funny about a foul mouthed boy getting a chip implanted in his brain which shocks him everytime he swears, which he did often due to a movie he had recently watched, which had pretty much directly resulted in one of his best friends burning himself to death (almost) to try to win $100 of said boy? Comic scenario or what.  AND ALL A BIT OF FUN. Thank you Trey and Matt, but the hard part is trying to eclipse it in South Park: Even Bigger, Even Longer and Still Uncut.

Great feature film adaptation,"This film is a great adaptation of the cartoon series to the big screen.

An excellent animated film based on an excellent animated TV series.,"Rated R for pervasive vulgar language and crude sexual humor,and for some violent images.South Park Bigger Longer and Uncut is the film version of the animated television series South Park.Now I must say that this review is biased.I am a huge fan of the show.South Park is my favorite television show so of course I will give the film an excellent review.If you are a fan of South Park you will love this movie.It is my #1 favorite movie of all time.I suggest every South Park fan see this movie.For people who are not a fan of South Park...you might enjoy this movie but not as much as if you were a fan of the show.There are plenty of laughs even if you are not a fan of the show but for non fans I suggest waiting for the TV version.The movie is pretty short but good.It is about the four south park boys Kyle,Stan,Kenny and Cartman who go sneak into the new Terrence and Philip movie.The film has plenty of profanity and fart jokes and pretty soon the boys start to imitate.This causes the parents of South Park to wage a war on Canada the country the film was made.So now its up to the boys to save Terrence and Philip and stop the war.There is a good message in the end of the film as well for strict parents who blame everybody for say violence in a film.South Park Bigger Longer and Uncut is an excellent film and one of my favorites.Runtime:81min10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Number One Comedy EVER!!!,"Who cares it's violent? Who cares it's offensive? Who cares every other word is the 'f' word or the 's' word? This movie is about three things: 1, to stand up for censorship and the fact that we shouldn't take so seriously. 2, to show parents that they need to worry more about what their kids know and learn rather then worry about what they're watching. And, 3, to LAUGH and HAVE A GOOD TIME!1: Censorship has it's ups and it's downs. It's ups are that people are comfortable with watching censored shows so they won't get offended. It's downs are when it is taken to far and people go too far with it trying to blame everybody and everything...everyone except themselves. That is what is shown that is wrong with our country. We see something as insignificant as this, and if given the chance, we would seriously start a war rather than take the blame. We've gone into a world where America is never wrong, when in fact, it has about a million more things wrong with it than it does right. Also, this movie deals with censorship in language more than anything else (that's why it swears so much, so people can realize that 'hey, these are just WORDS. Words don't hurt!') Because that's exactly it. Words don't hurt. But violence and some graphic sensuality is seen on TV all the time. Recently, I saw a movie on TV that was edited down, so we didn't hear the 'f' or 's' word, but we still saw a guy's head being cut off. That's right, a guy's HEAD being CUT OFF. Uncensored. But thank God our kids didn't hear the bad words. What's good about this movie is that the parents realized that the deaths and violence in the war they caused was way worse than their kids hearing some naughty words and profanity/vulgarity. Unfortunately, in today's world, parents will never learn.2: Parents need to worry about being parents. Not fighters. That is what Kyle is talking about in the end. What he says isn't just about him and his mom, it's about every kid in the world and every mom in the world. Particularly in America. If kids are watching bad shows or R-rated movies, than it's up to parents to tell them what's right or wrong and decide if the kids should watch these things. Not go so far as to suing or fighting the creators of the bad shows. You can't just shield all bad programs from kids and expect them to all understand it when they're 18. Basically, you need to start small and end big. Show them G-rated programs and Nick Jr. cartoons until about 6 or 7. Then start with PG movies. These movies have very little offensive material, and it starts small so it can build up to PG-13. Kids will ask ""what does 'damn' mean"" or ""why did they hit each other"" and you, as parents, explain. Then they understand what they mean and whether they are good or bad. Then, around 10 or 11 you can start with PG-13, with a lot more subjectional material. Slowly, they begin to build with what they feel is right or wrong and understanding it all. And then when they can start watching R-rated movies, they are all different, so pick certain ones and build from there (however, the South Park movie, Team America, and similar movies can wait till the end). Then, when they are 18, they will know what their parents consider wrong and right and can build their own opinions on wrong and right and decide how they want it to be in their own adult lives.Whew. Now...3: Humor. This movie is a comedy. If you can't laugh at it, then you have a very low sense of humor. But you are entitled to your opinion. But leave us fans alone. I've heard the complainers say they don't like it because of the excessive language. That is the whole point of the movie, der! To prove that language doesn't hurt us, they are just words. And if it's because it's annoying, then just ignore it. I personally didn't find the excessive language annoying, and I don't know why it can be annoying when it's used in perfect situations in this movie! Anyway, if you don't like this movie, stop wasting your time bitching about it.So, in conclusion, this is just a movie. Don't take it seriously, and just treat it like it is. It's meant for you to have a fun time, and if you didn't then that's too bad. If you did, then that's what the creators wanted. I give this movie a 10/10. In a weird way, the most profanic cartoon in the world has taught me a lot. South Park can do that to you :).",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The funniest animated movie ever!,"I think one of the greatest forms of comedy is when little kids swear. It has great shock value, and their young accents spice up the bad words with great comedic material. This movie takes that concept to the extreme. It's a hilarious social satire, with some great obscenities, and insults.Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman are excited to see a brand new Canadian movie called ""Asses of Fire,"" starring their cartoon heroes, Terrance and Phillip. The movie is rated R, and when they sneak in, they find out why. The movie is nothing but a collection of vulgar language, and fart jokes (sound like any movie you might be reading about?).When they come out of the movie, not knowing the meanings, the swear words from the movie become a big part of their vocabularies. The parents are outraged at first, and try to boycott the movie. But when Kenny is killed while trying to imitate a stunt from the movie, Terrance and Phillip are arrested, and the government declares war on Canada. When the boys learn that Terrance and Phillip are set to be executed, they form a resistance to save their heroes. Meanwhile, in Hell, Kenny learns that when Terrance and Phillip are killed, gay lovers Satan, and Saddam Hussein will rule the world.This movie, for a film full of vulgarity and obscenity, actually has a logical, if very twisted plot. It has a serious message about how the MPAA is okay with violence, and everything else is evil. The movie is meant to poke fun at itself. The movie they see is an uncensored adaptation of a vulgar cartoon. That's exactly what this movie is. It's subliminally warning people not to boycott this film, because war could break out.Oh yeah. Did I also mention that this movie is funnier than Hell (and Hell is pretty darn funny in this)? The concept of little kids constantly spewing obscene insults never gets old in this movie, because the language is all used in a really creative fashion, featuring the filthiest insults ever spoken in a film. The music is the real highlight of this film. The music, while hilarious, is also catchy, and you may find yourself singing the songs frequently. This is one of the funniest movies ever, and gets a strong 10/10.It is rated R for Pervasive Vulgar Language and Crude Sexual Humor, and for Some Violent Images.

"Absolutely hilarious, one of the few big-screen TV adaptations which do the original series justice","One of precious few truly great adaptations of television series for the big screen, ""South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut"" is an inspired theatrical translation of the glorious satirical television show created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Given the freedom of a feature film the writers create something which justifies a theatrical release based on its scale and storyline, but which also avoids (until the last ten minutes, at least) the sort of bloat and/or dumbing-down which is usually the result of a theatrical film version of a TV show, see ""The X Files"" or ""The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse"".""South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut"" is a strikingly, uproariously hilarious satirical take on the MPAA rating system, parents' media watchdog groups, Canadian-American relations (okay, so this part isn't so much a satirical take as a bunch of well-written Canada jokes which, as a Canadian, are absolutely hysterical), ""Les Miserables"", the controversial nature of ""South Park"" as a television series, and warmongering in general. Like the television show it manages to be political but completely irreverent and uninterested in expressing any form of liking or support for either end of the political spectrum.The musical numbers are the most memorable and inspired sections of the film, particularly ""Uncle F-cka"", ""Blame Canada"", and ""It's Easy, M'Kay"". The only musical numbers that don't work are the two relatively short ones by Satan, although his beau Saddam gets a really good one here in ""I Can Change"". Actually, the film would have been perfect had it not included the really unfunny sub-plot with Satan and Saddam. It fits with how cheerfully offensive the movie in general is, but it's just unfunny. These scenes, and the bloated ending (which goes from tolerable to bad when Saddam and Satan show up) are the only problematic scenes in the whole movie, the rest of which is just perfect.Sure, it's rude, crude, offensive to some, and jam-packed with profanity, but ""South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut"" is also, much like the best episodes of ""South Park"", genuinely funny, intelligent, and perceptive, and it has a lot to say. It's brilliant, brilliant comedy.9/10",,Anonymous,Animation

Choir democracy,"Spooky seeing South Park today, what a prescient, insightful film.Jump on board. Sing our song. That's the way politics are made.It shows high artistic standards to use the form of a film, a musical in this case, for the message of a film, very good structural thinking there. Although the spectrum of the film is limited, concentrating on a social codex that could be called hypocritical, it's almost an uninterrupted joyride thanks to a sufficiently short running time on the one hand and a sufficiently over the top story development on the other.

The funniest thing about the whole film is that it's a parody of censorship and mimicks the reaction they knew this film would get from the so-called moral majority (more like minority in my case).To quote Cartman after having seen the silly and offensive Terrance and Philip film: ""you've warped my fragile little mind"".The script writing was excellent, the film took a swipe at everything from Satan's sexuality to Saddam Hussein, and there was some brilliant scenes in which the writing really shone through.Perhaps it's time to change my mind and start watching the series, although it's much toned down to appease the incredibly anal culture of US television.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The most shocking cartoon I have ever seen.,"I have been a longtime fan of the controversial TV show South Park, and I went to see the feature-length movie the first night it came out.

It even pokes a LOT of fun at Canadians (which I am), which makes it a hilarious free-for-all that is NOT for children or the easily offended.Most of the characters are here (except Mr. Hankey - a shame, but I can't really see where Parker could have written him in), and there's a LOT of hilarious musical numbers (including the side-splitting Terrance and Phillip song, ""Uncle F--ka"").

Not as funny as I hoped it would be,"To be honest, the movie was ok, but not as good as I hoped it would be. I have seen the series only once or twice (not being home at the right time and lacking a video), but from what I have seen I prefer the series to the movie.Of course it's all a matter of taste. And then I do not mean the bad taste of the makers (I had heared about the many swear words before, feared it would be boring, hoped it would be funny, found it had a good function in creating a consistent atmosphere), but the preference for the various movie styles. I simply do not like musicals, and although some of the songs in this movie are actually quite good, I am of the opinion that they break the tempo of the movie, in a negative way. I had hoped to see more humor. There is a good dose of humor, but I still feel the density is considerably lower than in a TV episode. On the other hand the makers have succeeded very well in having a morale to their story and at the same time making fun at that very same morale.All in all, anyone who has been following South Park all the time certainly has to see this movie and will not be disappointed, but those who, like me, have only seen a little bit of it, or just heared of friends how good it was, would do better to make a tape of two or three of the TV episodes.

"One of the Most Misunderstood Movies, Ever","This, along with the TV show, is probably one of the most misunderstood pieces of film in recent history. Receiving a lot of undeserved criticism as being a show simply based on ""fart jokes"", people seem to easily forget how many other pieces of classic literature contain similar raunchy material to help audiences swallow their moral message (i.e. Jonathan Swift, Geoffrey Chaucer). If you find this film extremely offensive and unfunny you need to step back and try to appreciate the absurdity of it that truly makes it great. South Park (and Team America in parts) both are brilliant satyrs of extremes in society and censorship. The film simply emphasizes the need to look at things in life with a grain of salt, much in the same way people should look at the movie. When people lose there sense of humor, people lose it (or start a war with Canada). There are also a bunch of critiques on responsibility in society and censorship but I'll try to keep this relatively short. In closing, The film is hilarious, the songs are great (Yeah, it's a musical), and the messages are pretty interesting if not valuable lessons, on at least some level or another. Keep in mind, this movie is not for children, it is very vulgar, and they wouldn't understand the true point anyway (as the movie actually shows in its plot). **** of **** stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Possibly the Funniest Comedy Ever,"I can't say that for sure, since I haven't seen every comedy. But I would definitely say that it's one of my favourites. The transition from a television show to a movie is not an easy one. This is one movie that got it right in every aspect. The movie doesn't come across as a long episode or anything. It comes across as a movie. It's probably the movie I can watch the most without getting bored of it.It's got a good (and of course ridiculous) plot. America takes Canadian comedians Terrence and Phillip hostage for making a smutty movie, which all the kids saw and picked up bad habits from. If they get executed, Satan and his gay lover Sadam Hussein will be able to take over the world. South Park Humour at its best. And the songs are just fantastically funny. And not just funny but very catchy as well.The movie basically pokes fun at many different things. It pokes fun at the way things get blown way out of proportion. It pokes jun at how uptight people are about smutty stuff, yet violence is no big deal. And of course there are the gay jokes about Sadam. And if I'm right it's also poking fun at the way America sees other nations. I'm sure many people find this movie offensive, but it's all just good fun.Heaps of the characters had great lines in this movie, especially the evil Cartman. Of course he doesn't fail us in the movie. He offers us plenty of awesome lines every minute. The movie is packed with plenty of unnecessary swearing, and rude jokes, and that's all part of the fun.A great aspect of the movie is that it didn't rip us off with the main characters. Each one of the four had their own story going on through the movie. I won't say Cartman's as it may give away more than you want to know, but Stan is struggling to win Wendy's heart again after a new, more sophisticated boy comes to town and rivals him for her affections. Kyle struggles with standing up to his overbearing (to say the least) mother. And Kenny has his own problems even after death. (Yes Kenny dies, big shock there.)I would also like to talk about the animation. It is the best badly animated movie around. It is sort of hard to explain, but I will try. The movie is drawn very crudely, yet it's done with great animation, especially in certain scenes. I would also like to comment on how awesome it looks during the entering of hell scene.So in closing, this is an awesome movie that every fan must see. Even if you aren't a fan I would recommend this to you. Well maybe not if you don't like the humour in the show, but if you haven't seen it, it's a great example of South Park style comedy, and I think it serves as an instant fan creator. I don't think any fan will be disappointed with this movie. It's just everything you could hope for and more. (To use a tired old phrase.)10/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great musical and a bizarrely political film,"Did I mention that it's hilarious too?  Formatted as an old-fashioned musical, complete with Broadway-ready tunes by Marc Shaiman, this tells the story of the loss of innocence in South Park thanks to Hollywood's R-Rated movies.  Sound familiar?  The parents pick up the cause, of course neglecting their own kids as they find themselves fighting Satan and Saddam Hussein. The numbers are fantastic; I'm worried that audiences (and even critics) have forgotten what a good song is, and that, unbelievably, this film will fly OVER everyone's head. But listen to Kyle's Mom's song, ""Blame Canada"", for a great example of a song advancing the story AND being wildly entertaining at the same time. Each offensive joke also makes a point, either about racism, homophobia, or plain bad parenting...you laugh because it's all true. A warning: I have no idea how this film got an R-rating; use extreme caution with letting your children see this film. If they must see it, go with them, so that you can talk about the offensive portions; it's too easy for children to just pick up the imitative behavior without getting the accompanying satire.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Deceptively insightful,"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut is deceptively insightful. While many will hate the film, its awareness is admirable. Specifically, it's about parents overreacting to a vulgar movie. Since South Park garnered similar uproars, this plot is clearly satire. Beyond being meta, South Park champions themes of censorship, scapegoating, and violence. Essentially, it's social commentary, showing that responses to vulgar media can be more destructive than the vulgarity itself. Since South Park is harmless (besides some outdated slurs), its backlash was misguided. Ultimately, South Park simultaneously advocates for free speech while testing its boundaries. Thus, it deserves credit.Meanwhile, South Park has witty craft. First, its simplistic animation is endearing and iconic. Ironically, this earlier art style is more appealing than its sleeker evolutions. Next, the sound, editing, and visuals utilize overheads, crossfades, and silence for comedic effect. Plus, the pacing is active and the sound is engaging. Lastly, the music is the surprise highlight of the movie. South Park is an unlikely musical, providing multiple original hits that are still relevant parts of pop culture. Overall, South Park is a polarizing experience that will evoke reactions from all viewers. Some will detest it, others will find it hilarious, but nobody will be bored.Writing: 9/10

GREAT FLICK!!!,"This is definitely one of the most hilarious movies of all time, and if we're talking about musicals at all, then this is the funniest musical I've seen. The songs were all top-notch brilliant and histarical.One bit of advice: Realize this movie is ANIMATED before you watch it. It is crude, it is vulgar, and it is racist, but in what other type of movie genre can this work aside from animation?The movie's plot line is basically a U.S. declared war on Canada. This chain reaction of events was sparked by a foul-language-filled Canadian-made film released in the U.S.. Now as a Canadian, I did not find ANY ""anti""-Canadian scenes distasteful (the only thing I found distasteful was Robin Williams singing ""Blame Canada"" at the Oscars that year), I found them FUNNY, even if they didn't make any sense! For instance, throughout the movie, it was made out as if Canadians pronounce the word ""about"" as ""aboot"". I have NEVER EVER heard one person pronounce it that way. However, after the movie was released, it began popping up every now and again. THAT is film-making!!",,Anonymous,Animation
"Hilarious! The best R-rated animation movie ever, with just one problem for me","Let me tell you that i have not watched the TV show. Only after browsing IMDb did i even know that this was based on a TV show.This is the most funniest, craziest, perverted animation movie i have ever seen. So much of swearing. That was awesome. It is simply portraying the truth. Kids nowadays are so corrupted at such young ages. This movie is just a funny take on that. Plus a lots more (which i'm not gonna spoil. Just go watch it and it will be a superb laugh riot).Well, this is a movie which would easily offend you. And yes, it did offend me. Not because of the swearing pr anything, but because of that character ""Mole"" who is an atheist. There's nothing wrong in being an atheist. But to call God like that, really infuriated me and made me angry. Which is why instead of a 9, I'm giving this a 7.Well i know its a movie thats just made for fun. But talking about God like that would instill anger in many many people all around the world. If not for that character, the rest of the movie was simply amazing.Must watch movie, FOR ADULTS!!!!!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Even less like the Waltons...,"When George Bush Senior said that America should be less like 'The Simpsons', he probably didn't mean it should be more like 'South Park', the crudely animated, and downright crude, satire of American life. 'South Park' adapts to the big screen unexpectedly well, with an outrageous, almost-coherent plot, a musical format, loads of jokes and a hilarious central idea (the U.S.A. declaring war on poor, innocuous Canada). At its best, it's almost Chris Morris-like in its ability to make serious points in the most offensive manner possible. I suspect the formula has its limits, for at times the film seems as purile as its characters Terrence and Philip, the Canadian humourists whose dirty jokes trigger the war: there's a fine line between laughing at kids who can't stop swearing, and believing that four letter words are funny per se. But viewed as a one-off, it's fresh, funny and surprisingly political, and makes 'The Simpsons' seems cosy in comparison.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Scathing social satire,"When Trey Parker and Matt Stone were writing the script for the movie, they had to make a decision if they wanted to ""dumb down"" material for the non-fans. Instead, they decided to make this movie for the fans-and by God, this has got to be one of the funniest movies I have seen all decade. There was never a dull moment, the audience was uproarious, and I was laughing harder than I have in years.Even going as far as to top There's Something About Mary in its crudeness and extreme vulgarity, South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut does what few TV-to-movies do: make a jump to the next level by pushing the obscenity to the limit.I'll try and not spoil too much. The four kids go to see the Terrance & Phillip movie, ""Asses of Fire."" There is a musical number featured in the movie-within-a-movie which had the audience rolling, the lyrics consisting almost entirely of the f-word (and the TV show's bleeps are discarded for the film). The boys soak in the movie's naughty language and come out spouting forbidden obscenities. Soon other children see the movie. In the school classroom, there is an eruption of swearing and the boys are sent to the school guidance counselor, Mr. Mackey, who calls in their mothers to make them aware of what the Terrance & Phillip movie has done to the kids. They form The Mothers Against Canada and try to have Terrance & Phillip executed. Canada defends its humor while the United States laughs at them, and Canada retaliates by bombing the Baldwin brothers (very clever). Soon Canada and the U.S. are engaging in full-scale war.Meanwhile, Kenny dies (not surprisingly) and goes to Hell, where Saddam Hussein and Satan are in a homosexual love affair. Saddam only wants sex every five minutes and Satan wants to be loved. Their scenes in bed are a reason why kids should not see this movie. Back on Earth, the kids form a group to save Terrance & Phillip, ""La Resistance"" (obviously paying homage to Les Misérables) and make a plan to rescue Terrance & Phillip from the big USO show, where they are to executed. Guests at the USO meeting include Big Gay Al and Winona Ryder (who is happy to demonstrate her famous ""ping-pong ball"" trick). The kids attempt to sneak into the show and free Terrance & Phillip.This movie will shock you. You will not believe some of the jokes in this movie. It will offend many people. The film takes equal shots at Jews, blacks, Canadians, Bill Gates, and Jar Jar Binks, to name a few. I'm quite sure many will be offended by ""The Mole"" character and what the military's plans are for the 14th battalion (snicker).Fans will undoubtably love this movie. We finally see Kenny without his parka and hear him speak, and there's none of those annoying bleeps. I am a fan. I loved it. In fact, I'm going as far as to recommend it as a candidate for one of the best of 1999, let alone best comedy of the decade. This movie is non-stop laughs and it's very, very entertaining. It's not all toilet humor, either. The creators manage to get a message through, and there are large satirical tones concerning our modern society.I paused while writing my review to consider people who aren't fans of the show and what they will think, and I have kept those in mind. There is a lot of swearing and a lot of frankly gratuitous sexual material. I salute Trey Parker and Matt Stone for having the guts to push the R rating to its boundaries. This film is fun for movie buffs and those who love political humor. And so, I am awarding it four stars. In these trying times, we need a good laugh or two.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A brilliant satire, but also an honest comment on parental responsibility, censorship, and morality.","Stan, Kyle, Ike, Eric, and Kenny all go to an R rated film which is an adaptation of their favorite show, a crude humor filled Canadian skit comedy called TERRANCE AND PHILIP. Upon leaving, they imitate the language in the film, prompting their parents to react in surprisingly shocking ways. They start the MAC(Mothers Against Canada) before getting president Clinton involved along with talk show host Conan O'Brian before arresting Terrence and Philip and putting all Canadian-American citizens into special Concentration camps. Canada decides to act upon this and thus a gory war on Canada is declared. The boys realize that it's up to them to fix things before Satan takes over the world as soon as Terrence and Philip are executed. The fact that this film is animated is what makes it funny and ironic. In a way, the film is making a comment on itself and it's source material. The fact that the film has something very relevant to say about first amendment rights is what makes it daring and worth seeing. I do not know of any other film that does this. The originality of the concept really helps it define it's ability to be watchable. I consider the show, SOUTH PARK, to be one of the most brilliant and funniest television shows to come around for a while. This film not only pushes the idea of the show in a direction that makes sense, but it also takes into consideration the feedback the show gets for it's language and subject matter. Everything about this film is pretty perverse. Anybody can figure that out by just the title, SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER, AND UNCUT. When it was in theaters, a lot of people I knew who had no idea what the show was just assumed that it was a pornographic film. Indeed, there were times in the film in which the content was pushed a little too far. However, the show does this to me almost all of the time. What makes the show really special to me is that it actually bothers to challenge me and what I can handle in a way that works because it is animated. There are times when the show is really hilarious and over-the-top, and there are times when it actually challenges the viewer to laugh. There are times on the show in which there are genuinely emotional moments and times where there is heartless cruelty. This film is no different. The character of Eric Cartman has to deal with a V-chip that is surgically implanted into his head that caused him to get shocked when he swears. Stan is in love with a girl in his class who he can't have. Kyle's mother is the woman who starts the coalition against Canada and is forced to deal with the embarrassment of that and has to protect his adopted younger brother Ike as he is Canadian. These plights in this movie are treated with more sincerity and respect than they probably ever would in another movie. To help push things along and add even more emotion, there are also musical segments. The film is a musical and the songs in them are fantastic. This film has one of the better soundtracks of the last ten years. This film will always hold a special place in my heart. Nine years later, it is still amazing and funny as hell. Definitely check this one out if you haven't yet.",,Anonymous,Animation
Freedom of speech or freedom of slurs?,"As a moderate fan of South Park, I knew that the film could be either boring or terribly amusing. But it is in fact, a strong blow for freedom of speech! How they depict conservative people and their line of thought is not only important, but sometimes very accurate deliberately or not. But this film will certainly be remembered for its extremly foul language, and I was very surprised to see that they actually could make such a film in the US.Even more astounding was it to see that the audience seemed to be made up by mostly boys of the age of ten or so. Hardly the main target-group I am certain, yet they seemed to understand most of the jokes.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
***** This is the funniest movie of the 90's.,"The movie version of ""South Park"" had me --- and this is not exaggeration -- laughing so hard I was falling out of my chair.  I was laughing so hard it *hurt*.A) For using satire to make valid points about censorship and individual responsibility, this is the best movie I've ever seen.B) It's the best movie musical made since MGM left the mass-production business.  The multi-national production number of ""'Kyle's Mom is a Stupid Bitch' in D Minor"" is worth the price of admission.C) It's a fabulous, fearless boot to the butt of Political Correctness.Roger Ebert wrote that he felt very guilty about laughing, not knowing if it all ""had a point.""  He apparently was buying popcorn when Kyle flat out stated the point of the movie: that parents need to quit blaming ""bad influences"" and start *being parents* by talking to their kids.The gags are non-stop, the songs are terrific and there is an unbelievably touching moment involving Kenny near the end.

"Have they gone ""too"" far?","I will grant you, this film is hillarious, but at the expense of making fun of every kind person imaginable (which is fair, no one is left out) and subjecting the audiance to a constant barrage of gratuitous language and extremely lude depictions of the human anatimy.  But by God this movie had everyone rolling in the aisles.But afte the film was done, I was left wondering...have Parker and Stone gone too far?I was an advid viewer of South Park before the film and when I found out that there was going to be movie I was hoping to find all the things that made South Park great...only more. Boy was I in for the biggest shock in my life.  My reaction to alot of scenes was basically the same as little Stan when he is confronted by a totally off the wall experiance, ""Dudes, this totally fu(beep)ed up.""If they took out the constant showing of certain parts of the male anatomy and gone a little bit easier on the language, I wouldn't have any problems with the film.  But for some reason I was left with almost the same feeling as I did when Stone and Parker made that South Park episode  totally devoted to Terrance and Phillip....it caused me to avoid South Park for a while. But now this movie has made me go on a sort of boycott of the show now.It is funny, but it is a film that you would want to see.....only once (at most).But be forwarned: Very Very Strong language, repeated showing of nudity (both female...and male), extreme violence, and no-holds-barred, anything goes, racists jokes targeted at everyone (and I mean everyone, even white people).",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Go ahead...Blame Canada....See if I care.  Trey's more Cannuck than Bryan Adams will ever be.,"A hilarious musical besting Trey's earliest forray into film ""Alferd Packer, The Musical"" (also in this DB, though that one not R rated)  This is NOT..I repeat NOT a movie for the kids.  And yes they will take every measure possible to get you to bring them.  It is hugely vulgar and uses combinations of profanity I have never heard before.  Beware the ""Video Sleep Over"" parties come September.  However, you are not going to be able to keep the tykes away from exposure completely, so best to talk to them aboot the content and language first.  Do the job that the story is aboot. Parent your children.That being said, the film is one of the funniest of the season. Funnier, even, than The Spy Who Shagged me...sorry comrade Mike.  Myers wouldn't be welcome in the world that develops around South Park Colorado.  Nor would I, as we are both Canadians, and Canada is a four letter word in this SP.The songs in the flick are well conceived and executed.  Parker is a latent musical director with a great sense of humor.  ""It's Easy, MMMkay"", ""Blame Canada"", the ""Uncle F**ka"" song and dance, and ""What Would Brian Boitano Do?"" are good examples of his prowess.  You even detect a hint of ""All I Really Want"" from Alferd Packer poking into a song.   You soon become desensitized to the language (for good or bad) and can appreciate the cleverness of the lyrics and staging.I recommend this to anyone who has consciously or unconsciously hummed ""Mr. Hanky the Christmas Poo"".  But beware where you choose to sing some of these songs.There are some subjects and comments which will make some feel uneasy, like the scenes in Hell but I think they're cleverly designed to bring some of our phobias to bear and beg the question ""What do you expect from Hell? What's taboo in Hell anyway?""I'm still alive and kicking so the movie won't kill you.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

South Park is an incredibly dangerous movie for those who do not understand or are developing an understanding of the Gospel,"Satan is portrayed as the homosexual lover of Saddam Hussein and is portrayed as a sensitive, loving and caring being. God's name in vain was used many times. Angels were portrayed as females - nude, very nude. God was called many vulgar and hateful names. Satan was glorified. Jesus was equated with sexual anatomy. The dead child, after being rejected from Heaven (by nude female angels) and cast into Hell (which is a violation of Scripture in and of itself), was then presented as a ghost trying to influence the other kids. And throughout the movie was script to promote licentious belittlement of wholesome life and entertainment: rationale to lessen even further the threshold of acceptance. These are but a very few of the examples of ignominy in this sinematic cyanoide developed in the fiery pits of Hell. And the kids in the audience loved it, almost as much as the adults with them.

Clearly the way to go for overkill,"After a successful tv run, t-shirts, and mocking albums, the next step is clearly a movie. I rarely watch the show, but when I do, I find myself laughing out loud as much as being annoyed.This movie is an improvement from the show, to a degree. The first 1,000 times the F-word is uttered ( and mentioned in several songs) I wanted to congratulate Trey Parker and Matt Stone for bending the rules of the MPAA and bringing the freedom of speech in movies to the edge of the cliff.But I only felt like this during the first half hour. In fact, I got tired as the F-words went from shocking to boring to annoying. It was like having your 5-year-old nephew with tourettes syndrome on your leg and yelling at you.The movie has its share of good ideas: Saddam Hussein and Satan in bed (even though you have to wonder why Hussein is used as a joke six years after the HOT SHOTS sequel), the use of Conan O'Brien and George Clooney. Also, the Winona Ryder bit featuring the voice of Minnie Driver.Though I liked the La Resistance thing, the whole war on Canada was dumb and excrutiating. Probably because it was a main plot point and hey you have an hour and a half, you might as well have some kind of story. Also the joke with Chef involved in the army is offensive (for the wrong reason) and there's a little to much going on between Satan and Sudaam. And the much-hyped scene featuring the face of Kenny wasn't so special, in fact, I was kind of disappointed.But at least Trey Parker and Matt Stone are smart enough to use the freedom of making a feature film.

Profound Profanimation,"""South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut"" aims below the belt from its very title and never stops. I wince at posters here who talk about taking their children to see it as if it were some great First Amendment victory rather than a serious lapse of parental responsibility. But give the Devil his due: This is a very funny film that makes you think.After watching the Canadian comics Terrance and Philip comedy film ""@$$*$ Of Fire"" with its hit song ""Uncle %@*&er,"" impressionable fourth-grade South Park, Colorado student Eric Cartman tells his teacher ""How would you like to suck my *@%%s?"" Reaction is swift, as South Park parents blame Canada, and that %#@*^ Anne Murray, too. War is soon on between the United States and its neighbor to the north. Baldwins die needlessly, Cartman's mother appears in a German $^*&%*% video, and Satan and his abusive gay lover Saddam Hussein prepare to conquer what's left of the world.What the %@*&!""BLU"" uses the universe of the hit Comedy Central television show to score points against censorship, jingoism, and parental myopia. It also is hilariously funny, in a way that uses the vulgarity on screen not as a substitute but augmentation for a broad range of humor that satirizes everything from race relations (""Have you ever heard of the Emancipation Proclamation?"" ""I don't listen to hip-hop!"") to ""Les Miserables.""""This is what happens when toilet humor is allowed to run rampant!"" says Sheila Broflovski, a mother whose response goes way beyond just saying no.Sheila is one of several characters voiced by the late Mary Kay Bergman, who also gives life to Cartman's anything-goes Mom and pre-teen love object Wendy Testeberger. Not just funny, there's a lot of heart in her work, which feeds off and embellishes the writing by creators and co-voice artists Trey Parker and Matt Stone.Is ""BLU"" the apogee of ""South Park""? There are actually funnier TV episodes, and bolder ones, too. But this film has heart to go with its nerve, and works at introducing a larger audience to Stone and Parker's caustic comedy without putting too many people off.Making the film a musical is pure genius that way. It plays at the whole ""kids-putting-on-a-show"" thread that has run through children-focused comedies since ""Our Gang"", but the songs are catchy and well-composed. ""Up There"" would be a classic show-stopper in a legitimate musical, but it kills with Satan singing it after another spat with Saddam. Philip's Anthony Newleyesque vocal stylings crack me up every time.How could those ""South Park"" guys create a story where Satan is the most sympathetic character? Well, it worked for John Milton. The movie puts me off with its smugness, though, and a final act that strains too hard for significance.Pretending nothing in this movie is offensive is ridiculous. But pretending nothing in this movie is funny is hopeless. ""BLU"" merits consideration with ""Blazing Saddles"" and ""There's Something About Mary"" as one of the great shock comedies of all time.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

The perfect drunken frat party movie,"This is the perfect frat party movie. Just get a bunch of drunken guys around the VCR, and pop in a tape of ""South Park, the Movie"". There's no point to this film, it's just a bunch of kids learning the joys of swearing. In fact, the plot, to the extent it exists at all, just gets in the way of the raunchy comedy. In short, the drunker you are, the more you will enjoy this film. I must admit, I wasn't all that fond of the TV series. It seemed like just another comedy based on annoying, bratty kids, a theme that's been done do death with ""The Simpsons"" and ""Beavis & Butthead"". But this movie is perfect for the frat set.

Two words: %*@#in' HILARIOUS,"I can't remember the last time I left a movie theater and was physically worn out from laughing so hard. For at least the first 45 minutes it was nonstop funny. After that there's a bit of a slowdown but even then there's still more hilarious jokes then in the entire running time of most comedies. I'd prepared myself for a letdown just in case but it wasn't necessary, Trey and Matt did it RIGHT.If you're a fan, this will be the funniest movie you see all year.  If you're not, you'll either become one by the end or you'll walk out of the theater in the middle, like at least 5 people that left the packed house we were in on opening night.

South Park: The *&%@$! Musical,"Is it worth paying $7 to watch an extended South Park episode that doesn't have the cursing bleeped out of it?  That's the question that you'll have to answer before forking over your hard-earned money to watch this movie. Sure, there is some of the twisted humor that's given South Park it's cult following, but not really any more than a standard 30 minute episode that you can watch every Wednesday on Comedy Central.  Some of the musical numbers are pretty good, others seem like padding to get the runtime up to 90 minutes.  Bottom line:  If you're a South Park fan, don't miss it.

Maybe censorship's a good thing.,"I have always loved the TV show.  Not afraid to make jokes out of anything, I rarely saw an episode that I wouldn't give at least 7 out of 10.  The movie was different.  It's like when the burden of censorship was lifted, they spent all they're creative inspiration on nothing but uncreative, unoriginal, and need-I-say humorless vulgarity.  It was used purely for shock value, and with the amount large of movies out that are 'worse' than South Park, not even that worked.  I though that it was a major let down, and I cannot believe that it's the same hilarious show that airs of Comedy Central.  If you want to see a dirty movie that's actually funny, skip South Park.

"A fun, clever film adaptation to one of my favorite cartoons!","It may be more of a guilty pleasure for me than anything, but somehow, despite the odds, South Park: Bigge, Longer, and Uncut somehow works very well, and is quite an outrageous and fun time at the movies. All your favorite characters from the small screen return in glory in this well animated feature film. It's full of some surprisingly decent, and really catchy songs, and was a lot more musical than I expected. Personally I have become a bit tired to the standard animated format of random musical numbers, but the film seems to make light of it, and do it in a way that still seems rather original. There are a few cliche moments, like the character opposing Stan and his crush Wendy, which I just found to be an unnecessary plot point, only kept to give the character of Stan something to do and/or fight for. That being said, the film is very fun, rather entertaining, and at times, can be absolutely hilarious, especially towards the end. The absurd, foulmouthed nature of the film may be too much for some, but for me, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut was a very fun time at the movies, and one film I wouldn't mind seeing again.

An excellent South Park Movie,"In a small American town, four boys learn foul language from a Canadian film which is full of obscenities and toilet humor. As a result, their moms send them to rehab, but since the boys see the movie again and again, they decide to arrest and execute the main actors of the movie in question, thus starting a war between the two countries. In the meantime, the boys try to stop them, as a much bigger threat is awaiting the highly publicized execution.It's a movie realized in the world of the famous South Park series, only this time as a film and uncensored. It a wonderful depiction and, of course, exaggeration of people's mistakes and bad habits, which are taken to the extreme and made fun of. Talking about fun, this movie is simply hilarious, almost every action bringing tons of laughter from every possible side. It's very well made, well animated as the entire series, funny, funny and again funny.It's also a musical which most of the time is very well preformed, but they kind of exaggerated with this type of moments, beginning to be a bit dull and boring towards the finale. The plot is also very well written and put into action. Overall, it's a very good film which carries the big name of South Park, which is to be recommended without any doubt, but not to everyone, due to its explicit content!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Bad mouth musical!,"Do not misunderstand me - I really did love this film. The problem is the singing every five minutes. If I wanted to see a musical I would have seen ""Annie"", NOT Southpark. Matt Stone and Trey Parker has performed well in creating a humoristic movie and some of the songs are ok too, but there are far too many of them. You'll start pressing fast forward sooner or later, probably sooner. Too bad folks. What could have been a truly fantastic movie is messed up by too much singing.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's a musical!!,"I had heard a lot about this film, how great it was, and I think it got played up a little too much.  However, it does have some great aspects, including an AMAZING collection of songs... The tunes are swingin', lighthearted and lots of fun.  (My favorite was ""Brian Boitano"")  That songs even exist in this film is crazy.  That they are good, well-orchestrated production numbers is incredible, and adds a genuinely Broadway feeling to the movie.  It is my opinion that the music in ""South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut"" rivals what is found in many Disney films.*********** Still, this movie is not as good as the TV show.  I would have to agree with some of the other viewers, by saying that I DID find the constant profanity distracting.  (Particularly, the Terrance and Phillip ""movie"" is pretty annoying.) In the TV show, the profanity is used with style and character, but here it is just overused and gets irritating.   As a space filler, the profanity robs this film of its potential for a great verbal script.   One of South Park's outstanding attributes is the unique, zany dialogue... I was expecting that same, provocative banter between the characters in this film, and it did not deliver.***************** I do not feel that the overall quality of this movie is near that of the average TV episode.  It has little of the intelligence and filthy charm, the honesty and clever, child- perspective that makes its lead characters so joyous to watch. It does make a statement, and has the social commentary that is the show's trademark, but it is dragged down by CONSTANT, overtly sexual references, which are limiting and uncreative.  (By contrast, ""Beavis and Butt-head Do America"" was much better able to bring on a plot that was original, and mesh it with the characters' normal dialogue. It did not change the style and feeling of the TV show just to take advantage of an R Rating, which seems to be the case with ""South Park""..)******************* Beyond this complaint, the film has merit.  The plot is interesting and unpredictable (Parker and Stone would have it no other way), full of opinion, color and satire.   Between the tiresome lewdness, there is some true wit and laugh out loud comedy. There's even an endearing new character (The Mole, a gritty, French revolutionary who gives his life for Stan's ""La Resistance"") and a touching ending that is both sad and triumphant.  Under all the offenses, there are poignant messages here about society and parenting.  Try as they may, the producers are unable to drown the meaning in eff-words, or make this outing mindless.   It may not have quite the heart and shine of the TV show,  but any South Park fan will enjoy watching Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Cartman and all their cronies embark on this musical, political adventure that is a classic in its own right.    My score: (all things considered) 6.5",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
This Movie Sucks Badly,"I don't know what surprises me more - - the fact that there isn't a negative number to select for this piece of garbage or that so many people found it so good (Come on, an 8 overall?).  The television show is risque and bold and it's tendency to scrape the boundaries of good taste make it a very entertaining show.  The movie (all I expected was instead of the ""bleeps"" you'd have the actual words) doesn't just scrape the boundaries of good taste, it invades it and stakes new territory for it's own.  I don't believe that there is anyone that it doesn't offend or any subject that it doesn't deem sacred.  Although it has (on occasion) the quality of it's television sister, it is long drawn out and boring most times  and ultimately in the end relied upon toliet humor to try and save it.  Unfortunately, it didn't work.  I watched the theater that I sat in decrease in size as the picture progressed from around 100 people down to a remaining 4 or 5 when the picture was finished.  Avoid this piece of crap like the plague.  Stick with the television show.  It has much more entertainment value.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
My take on this,"Yes, some of the jokes are tired, and the profanity would make a sailor blush, but please, look at some of the positives!1. It's better than MTV's ""Jackass"". 2. It's satirical, and it points out a lot of problems with our society. 3. It has humor, romance, action, and a little bit of science.I like the fact that Kyle is proud of being a Jew. I like the fact that Chef and his battalion (is that the word?) stood up for themselves instead of being pushed around by the army. I like how Mrs. Marsh makes the point that the war is more gruesome than swearing. I like how the army general says that you can still see fart jokes on Nickelodeon. I like that the kids want to be political, and that they ban together to save their heroes, even if their heroes are profane and explicit.If you can't find the good in this, you're probably one of those adults who can't lighten up.And we can still relate to all of this because we are at war, and it's a pretty pointless war.Watch it again and listen between the lines.",,Anonymous,Animation
Possibly the greatest musical ever made,"While the musical genre is bogged down by ""classics"" such as West Side Story, and The Sound of Music, or pop contemporary music video pieces of garbage like Chicago and Across the Universe, South Park remains to be one of most poignant satirical musicals ever made. South Park creates a world of absurdity that reflects the absurdity of real life. Due to the animation quality the choreography of the characters is easily manipulated and we see these crude characters both in style and language dance across this epic landscape of morality. An obvious satire of both the religious right and the liberal left South Park delivers on its promises to upset disgust and outright cry with laughter. Such classics as ""Uncle Fu""""er"" make me cry with laughter even after a few years. This movie celebrates the ability to manipulate people through music. This manipulation is never used in the classical sense but used to celebrate the fact that people will listen more closely if a scene is composed through music. This archaic storytelling device works very well in terms of an animated comedy. Since we are already in the realm of the unreal, why not sing dance and fart your through the course of it?",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Brilliant satire for the not-so-easily offended with lots of catchy musical songs,"Satire disguised as cartoon or cartoon disguised as satire? No matter how you want to see it, this musical-like movie based on the well-known series has insulted several people, mocked them, and said horrible things about them, but also made most of those people rolling on the floor of laughter.I love South Park. I think it is brilliantly written and very rewarding for those who pay close attention because there are so many comical layers that you want to watch the series and this movies multiple times so you can peel all those humorist layers off.The movie tells the story of 4 boys, Kyle, Eric, Stan and Kenny, who get to see a movie with tons of profanity. Being so impressed with the movie, Kenny Makes a dubious bet and sets himself on fire. Because of this, their mothers find a protest group, Mothers Against Canada, and eventually the U.S. government blames Canada for spoiling American youth. Canada bombs the Baldwins, and the U.S. declares war on Canada, and promises to execute Terrence and Philip. but this must not happen, because if that happens, because if these two figures get executed, Satan, currently having a gay relationship with Saddam Hussein, will come up to earth, making havoc and mischief. Therefore Stan, Kyle and Eric make a group of resistance children to stop the execution and their mothers once and for all.Such a wildly absurd premise is not only completely ridiculous, but also outrageously funny and a very good basis for political satire and hilarious one-liners like: ""The MPAA says: Horrific exploited violence is okay, as long as there aren't any naughty words! that, is what this war is about!"".

War Over Words,"True to its title, this big screen version of the popular animated TV series features more violence, profanity and obscenities than any prior episodes of the show. The film is not, however, offensive simply for the sake of it; the plot is full of satirical bite as the story focuses on four boys watching a controversial motion picture (not unlike the one that they are in!) and the over-the-top reactions of the local community when they start repeating obscene phrases that they heard. Intelligent debate is brought up in terms of whether offensive language or graphic violence is more dangerous and there is something pointed in how everything culminates in war simply over words. The relative innocence of the boys is notable too; as they say in song, ""the movies teach us what our parents don't have time to say""; they are only curious about the adult world and are not interested in offending anyone. Cartman aside, the boys do not repeat any of the obscenities from the film-within in hate. Interesting as all this might sound, the movie runs out of steam well before the credits roll and the carnage towards the end comes across as a rather mindless. The series consists of half-hour episodes after all, and running at nearly three times that length, it is perhaps only inevitable that the material does not stretch out that well. There have also been several better satirical episodes released in the years since this feature length treatment came out, but full of bright songs and quirky characters, 'Bigger Longer & Uncut' does quite well for what it is.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A daily comment from Midget Emma: South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut (1999),I grew up watching South Park. I would laugh and draw pictures of my favorites. Then one day the movie came out.

After i watched it i realized why my Dad wouldn't let me see it. Now this isn't as good as the TV show but it was still entertaining.I didn't expect to see our favorites singing. But the songs were funny and were in my head for the next couple of days.This was very rude. It was basically a whole season of South Park rudeness worth.

Either incredibly funny or incredibly stupid.,"This movie is one of those few movies where you either bust a gut laughing or you wish that the creators would be put to death for committing the heinous crime of making it.

The songs are hilarious and just plain brilliant. I believe one was even nominated for an Academy Award, if I recall correctly. Yes, the language and the fart jokes may be considered over-the-top by some, but honestly, what did you expect? Even if you've never watched the show, you know what it is.

South Park hits the big screen and all Hell breaks loose,"In case you've been living under a rock for the last decade or so, ""South Park"" the TV series is based around the shenanigans of four young boys in the quiet mountain town of South Park, Colorado. Their exploits are often hilarious though anything but politically correct. Here, the characters hit the big screen and they do it in style.There's not a whole lot of change in comparison to the television series. The animation is still (in the words of Cartman) ""all crappy"" and the trademarks of the show are still in place. Following the show's tried and true formula, Trey Parker & Matt Stone use the big screen and big budget to create an ambitious musical satire.The story is a good one and worthy of the extended running time. The jokes come at a steady pace and, as usual, there is a message behind all of the lunacy. In this case the hot-button topic is profanity in films. How very appropriate.The voice talent is as solid as always and the few celebrities that appear do so in cameos, which is the way that it ought to be. The animation looks as good as can be expected given the style.The area where the film shows a marked improvement over the show is in the music department. There are several original songs that feature in the film, ranging from the absurd (""What Would Brian Boitano Do?"") to the profane (""Uncle Fucka"").This is easily my favorite American animated feature film and, unlike ""The Simpsons Movie"", it actually lives up to the reputation of the show that spawned it.

Very funny and well written,"I have always been a huge fan of South Park; it is one of the funniest and most clever cartoon TV series over the last decade. This is very impressive considering cartoons such as The Simpsons, Family Guy and Futurama have all been running in the same era as well. When it was announced that a film was being made, I couldn't wait and thankfully wasn't disappointed in any way.Trey Parker, Matt Stone and Pam Brady really go to great lengths to offend as many people as possible in this film which is of course making an ironic point considering the film is about a war over censorship issues. People who get caught up in moral dilemmas regarding South Park but they are morons who miss the point. South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut and the TV series has always observed issues and ridiculed them in an extremely funny way. People getting offended at South Park simply prove the writers' point. What is so brilliant about this film is it is like one big episode of the TV show and Trey Parker definitely went to great lengths to achieve this. As with Parker and Stone's first feature length film, Cannibal: The Musical, South Park: BLU is a musical which adds another dimension to the film and Trey Parker writes very witty lyrics. Possibly the cleverest aspect of this film is that the Terrence and Phillip movie that kicks off the plot is in fact a metaphor of the South Park movie itself.South Park is full of hilarious characters. Sadly characters such as Butters are not used in this film but the four main characters and the adult characters are all fantastic. Cartman for instance, is one of the funniest characters there has ever been. His hypocrisy makes him such a standout character and his desire to offend as much as possible means that memorable quotes always come from his mouth. Mr Garrison is an extremely morally wrong character which, as he is a teacher, makes another very funny character. Parker and Stone's voice talents go to great use and further proves how multi talented they are as film makers.One of the best things about this film is how it mocks the US Army. The racism shown by the army General, for example, is very funny because the film is not mocking blacks in anyway but making fun of racists and their stupidity. Also the USO show allows for more moments of hilarity and does a great job of making idiots out of all the army grunts. The war is almost prophetic considering the war against Iraq which happened some years after the film was made. Parker and Stone obviously read in to political situations very well when writing the film.Extremely funny and very witty, South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut benefits from being a cartoon because it gets away with so much more than it would have done with real people. The crude humour is immature but it works so well with South Park. Trey Parker and Matt Stone have done a terrific job with this film and deserve all the praise the film received.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Not for the faint of heart,"My first exposure to South Park was the film, Bigger, Longer and Uncut. Experiencing it for the first time, I was shocked, bewildered, and entertained by Stan's search for confidence, Kyle's moral compass, Eric's obnoxious personality, and Kenny's death. The Terrance and Philip movie has swept through South Park. It is so profanity laden, the kids of South Park are imitating the art. This provokes a violent reaction by the parents, it eventually leads to the capture of Terrance and Philip. Since they are Canadian, our neighbor to the north decides to declare war on the U.S. Meanwhile, Satan plans to use the war, particularly the execution of Terrance and Philip to usher in his new reign on the Earth. I will first get a few gripes out of the way. While The Simpsons uses subtle irony and satire to provoke thought, South Park hits the audience over the head with a shovel. There is no subtlety. In fact, sometimes the spirit is downright mean and vicious. In fact, sometimes it slaps fundamentalist puritanical culture with the same hatred it dishes out. This is the predominant weakness of South Park. Parker and Stone work so hard to shock and offend, they often sacrifice that for the message they try to get across. Also, the lovers spat between Saddam Hussein and the Devil was really drawn out too long, making the movie about 20 minutes too long. But there are some things that work. The best part is the humor that rests in both irony and unpredictable dialog and situations. One of my favorite parts was having Cartman rigged up to a V-chip that gives him a shock every time he utters a curse word. Another good scene involves the rescue of Terrance and Philip amidst a very strange USO show featuring Big Gay Al. Another involves the U.S. military strategists shooting Bill Gates for making Windows 98 too hard to handle. What really got me to like this movie, though, was its overbearing satire. Despite the shock factor, most people will get what Parker and Stone are trying to say. At one point, Kyle tries to dissuade his Mom from her vendetta against Terrance and Philip. However, she is so wrapped up in stopping their filth, she forgets to pay attention to her son. Also, one musical number stands out: Blame Canada. Apparently, the parents of South Park were so outraged at Terrance and Phlip, they break into song. Their battle cry is to ""blame Canada before someone thinks of blaming us!"" South Park does push the limit of good taste ... but that is what makes it fun. You could enjoy it ... if you are not too easily offended.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Just Not Funny,"Do you find swearing offensive? Then you'll find this film offensive. As i don't I rapidly got bored. The movie as I see it is aimed at children. The parallels of the boys sneaking in to see the Terrence and Phillip movie (rated R) while thebored and offended adults leave prove that Stone and parker don't really care if kids only like it.The parallels don't end there. Terrence and Phillip were notoriously responsible for the large drop in the show's ratings (when an unfunny T&P special wasshown instead of the conclusion of a storyline). When will the makers learn that T&P aren't funny?The movie was dull. It didn't have any of the surreal moments of the series but instead relied on musical numbers.I couldn't watch more than two thirds of the movie. Not because I ws outraged, but because I was BORED.

"Oh my God, they killed decency!","This was a clever movie that was also the most vulgar, most obscene piece of filmmaking I've seen outside of porn. Which is too bad, because the clever things -- ripoffs of Star Wars, Les Miserables, Disney musicals, race relations, the Motion Picture Association of America and the way the whole movie was really about itself (watch it and you'll understand) -- get buried under an avalanche of cursing (more than in an Eddie Murphy concert film), private parts and blasphemy that I had thought until now would be impossible to get away with in a mainstream movie.So I appreciated much about the movie. But I can't possibly recommend it to anyone.Yes, this is a movie for adults, and I judge it as such. And I'm not exactly chaste in my language or humor, unfortunately. But I cannot separate the idea from the content. The idea, coming through loud and clear, is this: There are no standards. Not between good and evil, proper and improper, right and wrong, etc.This is a dangerous idea.In the wake of Columbine, people have been too ready to blame entertainment for our ills.

Its about 4 boys who sneak into an R rated movie, and the swearing in it influences them to use that language.

This is why I love South Park.,"I have watched many shows on TV, but I have not seen one of South Park's outstanding capability to express a point through excessive satire and humour. South Park Bigger, Longer and Uncut is exactly what I expected from a feature-length South Park movie, it has numerous satire, toilet humour, gross outs gags and plain funny jokes that will leave any SP fan in stitches all the way through. But also, this film has a deep moral and political message hidden inside it about censorship, freedom of speech and war along with sun-plots about love, relationships, jealousy as well as strength and extreme bravery being portrayed through the simple ability to stand up and express how you feel.This film is basically a musical with so many great songs in between the moments of action in the film. The songs are both funny and uplifting as well as moving and dramatic. Listen out for 'Blame Canada' which earned an Oscar nomination for Best Music, Original Song. Also look out for Satan and Saddam Hussian, Bill Gates, Wyonna Rider, Big Gay Al, Terence and Phillips, The Doctor voiced by George Clooney and Chef singing.Fantastic, 10 out of 10, it has everything.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Witty social commentary just didn't make me laugh,"""South Park - Bigger, Longer, & Uncut"" certainly had the ingredients and idea behind a potentially great movie, yet fell far short of its potential. Although there are several moments of hilarity, overall the movie fails to succeed in capturing its goal - to criticize the value system of society while also making its audience laugh.  The first goal (and perhaps the most important in the creators' mind) is reached brilliantly.  Trey Parker and Matt Stone prove how truly f**ked up the American value system is.  They demonstrate how pure violence and sex is less censored than foul language which, unlike violence and (yes, even sometimes) sex, hurts no one.  This in itself is funny.  However, the actual movie in and of itself, regardless of its overall meaning, is not funny.  There are few really good laughs in this movie.  Many characters are unnecessary and undesired.  Most people who watch the show on a semi-regular basis will be dissapointed by the lack of comedy in this movie.  Some parts of this movie are just plain juvenile, and Kenny's character is misused.  Most people who leave the theater will realize that they remember little from the movie - there are just few memorable moments.  However, despite the fact that this movie is devoid of any truly memorable moments, people will ultimately remember its message. *** out of *****",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Profanity laden fun-fest,"I've more recently become a fan of South Park in the last few weeks. I was a middle school kid when the show originated and it was always that thing that parents didn't want us watching, but all of the cool kids did somehow and talked about it at school. I never had cable, and honestly crude humor never really did it for me. But I saw the series was on Hulu and decided to give it a try and I fell in love with it and it's crazy antics.This movie is just like an extended version of an episode, but free of all the censors that Comedy Central had to adhere to with the show. F-bombs can now be said, and in abundance; nudity can be show, though it isn't in this that much; and the gross-out humor and violence can go pretty much as far as it wants to.The show for sure has it's ups and downs, but I was genuinely surprised how amazing this movie was. It's just as funny as their top tier episodes. The animation is essentially the same as the show, but with a few scenes that included some 3D graphics. Those 3D scenes haven't aged well, but them being crappy probably was part of the joke that the creators think the show's animation is also purposefully crappy.As someone who generally is annoyed by musicals, this might be my favorite musical of all time. The songs are crude, but also catchy and extremely well written. I was ecstatic to get a new version of ""Kyle's Mom is a B****"" that had originated in the show.It's a shame they don't do more movies. but I kinda admire their one and done mentality. They did what a lot of 90's hit TV shows, did one movie because the studio was interested, then they kept doing their thing on the show.It's hard to say if you'll like this if you aren't a fan. It's really great, but if you don't like the humor of the show, it might be hard to recommend. Even then if you're familiar with the show you might still have a curse-laden good time with it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Next day at school they horrify their teachers with their new found vocabulary and once the parents become aware of this crude film, they are so outraged that they want to declare war with Canada.The film would go down a treat with South Park fans but despite a few laughs it was not for me and the it felt stretched with the longer running time.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

South Park is aimed at those who are emotionally and intellectually ready for one of the funniest adult movies of all time.

Also, there are several very funny and well written songs that are able to make this movie a great musical as well as being an animated comedy.

An hour and a half of South Park fun.,"How far can a television show go before it hits the big screen? South Park has tested the viewing public's interest and has made the big jump, quite successfully. Trey Parker and Matt Stone's creations have offended and astounded people on what is supposed to be a censored-for-television-show, and now, the four foul-mouthed youngsters have pushed the envelope to the edge. South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut may not be Parker and Stone's first feature film, but it is their first animated motion picture. It utilizes the show's entire main and supporting characters and includes several songs that could practically make the film a musical. Viewers of the Comedy Central program are familiar with Terrance and Philip, television show that features two characters who flagellate on one another for half an hour. South Park's main characters, Kyle, Stan, Kenny and Cartman are big fans of the program and make plans to see their feature film. (Sound familiar?) Although the film has an R rating, the group views the film and is exposed to its extreme foul language. Parents and teachers are shocked to hear the kids repeating lines from the movie in their day-to-day lives and make it their mission to silence Terrance and Philip once and for all. Because the show is created in Canada, the US Military plunges into war with them, being led by Kyle's mom. Meanwhile, the kids of South Park create their own resistance to stop the killing and bring freedom back to speech. Parker and Stone's message is pretty clear. The film itself has a restricted rating, aimed at preventing people under the age of 17 admission without a parent or guardian's accompaniment. This just so happens to be the film's target audience and the box office meal ticket. The film's release couldn't be timelier. The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) has just announced that all theatres must check identification before allowing teenagers into these films. Even President Clinton has jumped on the bandwagon and announced the same intentions not long after the Colorado shootings. So how far can a movie go? South Park seems to attempt to offend everyone in an equal manor. The Christian, Jewish, Canadian, disabled, gay, black and pro-choice all take heavy hits in this film. But to its creators, it is all in good fun. After all, if you can't laugh at yourself, you are taking things too seriously. As for the film's quality, it mainly has the same production values as the show. Some electrifying computer effects are used after Kenny torches himself to death. But amidst all of the gigabytes and pixels, the small cardboard character remains the same. A few of the jokes are recycled from the program, but most of the humor is new and is even more crude than before. To say that the profanity is extreme would be an understatement. Although it is the basis for the whole movie, it begins to get old after the first 15 minutes. The films best humor revolves around people's misconceptions about each other. Other hilarious moments include the relationship between Satan and his live-in lover, Sadam Hussein. Their musical numbers outdo the rest and culminate the film to its explosive ending. There is no doubt that South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut will do well at the box office, no matter who is buying the tickets. I was pleasantly surprised once I left the theatre. Many of the viewers in the audience laughed so hard they couldn't hear the jokes coming up next. Very rarely does a film generate more entertainment and laughs than the television show it has spawned from.",,Anonymous,Animation
Humour with spikes. 9/10.,"Very funny. The writers fill this movie with a sharp wit that pokes fun at society's failures and eccentricities. There is some courser humour too. I am a recent convert to South Park and have only managed to watch a few episodes. A couple of the episodes had me in stitches and while the film never reached that height it was close.A couple of insights:Both heaven and hell are depicted during the movie. While heaven is portrayed using 'normal' (ie. cardboard cut out) animation, hell is lavished with fluid special effects. No prizes for which destination the animators are more interested in.This is the second comedy I've seen that depicts the US going to war with Canada. Some of the jokes went over my head; '(Canada) is not even a real country.'  This is funny? There is obviously some friction between these two nations. National distrust between neighbours is common; the Scottish don't like the English who don't like the French. Most of Europe can't stand the Germans and they hate the Russians. Most of this can be put down to historical conflicts but US and Canada? Why?",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Quite a funny satirical musical for a non-fan of SOUTH PARK,"I've never been much of a SOUTH PARK fan, mostly because the same-y voices get on my nerves and the animation style isn't that aesthetically pleasing. Still, the send-up of America's morbid, puritan obsession with ""smut"" and ""profanity"" in pop culture while ignoring violence was funny and relevant. It also doesn't hurt that there are a number of hilarious songs. A lot of the humor had me scratching my head, or was mildly shocking for its audacity. However, none of it was less than interesting.

Trey and Matt have achieved their goal complete and total sell out, and along the way pi**ing off who ever they want.  The movie at times mocks society at large, popular culture, and even itself.  This is the genius of the whole thing.  It's everything the TV series couldn't get away with and more.

perhaps I have misjudged this show.,"I know it's a little late to write a comment on the south park movie but i must do it for some reason, maybe because the movie has warped my little fragile mind, or may be because when the movie debuted I was just a little kid.I am not a south park fan, and I don't really keep track of the episodes. The show is nothing to me more than vulgarity and plain outrage. But a couple of days ago a friend of mine lent me the movie DVD, and what I have to say to the creators is kudos for making such an awesome movie.what is awesome about it is that it is centered on one storyline and revolves around it. there were no subplots or anything. the storyline's basis is the incident of the four boys watching the infamous Canadian Terrence and Phillip movie that's full of foul language and consequently causes U.S.A. to declare war on Canada. I usually don't like movies that are filled with obscenities, but there was something about the south park movie that made it O.K to swear. Instead of being offensive, the frequent obscenities were hysterically amusing. No matter what parents say about the offensive language in this movie, it's inevitable that,at some point, vulgarities stop being offensive but become funny.Another thing that was awesome about the movie was the musicals. Actually the musicals is what I like about the movie the most. My top three musicals would be,#3, what would Brian Boitano do?#2, Kyle's mom is a b----#1, it's easy m'kay.The musicals were not only fast and inaudible unless you put on the subtitles, they were also hilarious. All the musical were fast paced and it was almost impossible to hear the lyrics. But if you do hear the lyrics, you will laugh your A$$ off. sorry, apparently I have been influenced by the movie's vulgarities.I heard this movie was nominated for an Oscar. And before seeing it i was wondering how? but after seeing it, I wondered no more. The south park movie is definitely Oscar worthy, and what's funny is how Matt Stone and Trey Parker showed up at the red carpet with their bizarre looks.(wearing girly dresses)My overall perspective of this movie is fast paced, interesting and hilarious, and definitely bigger, longer and uncut.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Masterpiece,"Master piece. This movie is the best of South Park and also exactly what makes South Park so good. Okay so first of the storyline is very overdramatised in a comedic way but the messaging that comes from the story is not only really well done but also super important even to this day. The comedy is also hilarious and mostly ages well, there's dark comedy, messed up comedy, some potty humour and lots of political comedy with a couple dated celebrity references. The music for South Park the movie is unironically some of the best songs in musical history, the movie makes fun of musicals while also creating an amazing one themselves. The movie also has loads of subtle details that add to the political messaging, comedy and rewatchability, whether you're a South Park fan or not I 100% recommend this to anyone who wants a laugh or is into film culture, this movie is a masterpiece and the flaws it has are incredibly minor.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Screw your Uncle,"Dang, now this was out of left-field. The concept of a south park musical sounds like a disaster brewing, but it amuses and relinquishes key gems of political wisdom at a few turns.

The vulgarity is funny and infectious, and you can tell Parker and Stone have a genuine affection for musicals. And let's face it, any movie that can pull off the act of turning an infantile schoolyard chant (""Kyle's Mom is a Bitch"") into an extravagant musical showstopper, courtesy of Mr. Eric Cartman, is a winner all the way.The main foursome - Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman - work with some of their all-time best material, and this exercise still stands up to some of the best episodes of the TV series, which is still going strong.",,Anonymous,Animation

Matt Stone And Trey Parker aren't really racist they're just being funny. The usage of being vulgar is very clever. They curse like crazy and they say vulgar things but it's all very clever and funny. I do agree with the people who say it is very rude and offensive. The thing is is that it's all a joke. I think it's funny although I wouldn't use those words all the time but if they didn't use those words or vulgar things it wouldn't be funny. Personally I'm a fan of vulgar and disgusting movies because it makes me laugh. If you get offended easily then I suggest you don't see this movie but if you are like me and don't get offended easily then I suggest you see this movie.,10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The best musical I have ever seen,This is the feature movie from the award winning show south park and it is just hilarious. It is actually a musical filled with catchy musical numbers that of which I know all off by heart. Great voice acting from Stone and Parker and hilarious writing also from the two men make this movie a piece of comedy gold and a must see.This movie is about the four foul mouthed kids from South Park Colorado who see a movie from Canada called Terrance and Phillip. The movie uses some foul language which the boys quickly emulate and go along saying it front of parents teachers whatever. The parents are outraged with Canada and make America start a war with Canada.This movie is just hilarious filled with dirty jokes and lots of satire. Like the fact Americans get so mad at Canadians for having bad language on T.V where as they have brutal violence and for some reason think language is worse.Im kind of surprised this movie even got made as it was only a year or two after south parks creation. I would love it if they made a new south park movie with the humor of today in it I think that would be amazing.,7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Disappointing, Stupid & Terrible!!","The cute kids of South Park finally come to the big screen in South Park:Bigger, Longer & Uncut from the clever creators of Trey Parker and Matt Stone. However, this is a disappointing attempt at the series' first film. In this tale, the kids sneak into an R-rated film starring their two favorite Canadian comedians and they soon discover much profane language is used. They start copying this language and soon the parents react. The moms form Mothers Against Canada(MAC)and prepare to lead an all-out war with the neighboring country. Meanwhile, down in Hell, Satan plans his to conquer the Earth along side his love partner Saddam Hussien. This is, unfortunately I have to say, is a terrible film. The musical numbers for one do not seem to add anything to the movie and just make it more non enjoyable. Secondly, because Parker and Stone now have the advantage of ""Uncut"", they feel it needed to overload the film with profanity instead of concentrating on the jokes. It's almost as if the only joke it this film is simply having these third graders curse. Only two scenes in the entire movie gave interest to me: one(the only)humorous scene where a V-Chip that is inserted into Eric Cartman's head is tested for the first time and another where we are given the physical appearance of Kenny's face. But other than that, this film was one of the biggest disappointments I have ever seen. Thankfully, third time was the charm for Trey Parker and Matt Stone [first time: Basketball; second time: South Park movie; third time:Team America] (*)GRADE: D",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
peak South Park,"This movie is absolutely incredible, genuinley one of the most perfect films i have ever seen, as a fan of the cartoon, i really enjoyed everything this movie set out to do, the story is fantastic and has a great massege on censorship, the animation while cheap is incredibly charming, the charecters are likable and get alot of development, the voice acting is great, the comedy is absolutely incredible, and the cherry on top is the unforgettable soundtrack, seriously this is actually one of my favourit movie musicals, every song is great, not a single bad song throughout the movie, my only tiny nitpick is that i would have loved for this movie to be a tad bit longer, but hey, if my only problem with the movie is that i want more of it you know trey parker and matt stone did a fantastic job, if your a fan of movie musicals and a fan of south park, i heavely implore you to seek this movie out as soon as you possibly can.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The funniest and most  clever animated film ever made,"South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is a very feverished and troubled satirical look at our society today, from politics to morals. For those fans of the show, this is practically a very longer, more epic, more exciting episode of the show, not that there is anything wrong with that. These days, most films based on shows lose the steam of what makes them so good on TV. This film is not that. Instead, we get the rude, disturbing, and bold jokes, together with some really twisted characters along the way. I found myself laughing at every bit. This is certainly a film that people must have thought 'We should do this, NAH' simply because no one ever thought a film, especially an animated film like this could ever be done. Yet here it is, and it does not disappoint. This is a risk taking film, and I admire it for that, but also, a guilty pleasure at everything wrong with the world today, yet we cannot help but laugh. And that is a good sign",,Anonymous,Animation
"""Well I guess you can light a fart on fire!""","South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut (1999) -I'd forgotten how much I had enjoyed 'South Park' (1997-) in general and I can't believe that I've never watched the film before.I remember getting back from clubbing with a Cheese & Ham Jacket Potato and watching the 20 minute cartoons religiously, when they first came out and I even had a stuffed Kenny toy, but after a while I ""Grew Up"" and shed my ""Childish Things"". It was only recently that I realised that those things were what made life fun. So I think that it maybe time to watch the whole series from the beginning again, because don't we all need a laugh right now?The whole idea of this film and obviously the series that came before, was so puerile and silly, but it was dead funny! If you took offence to this one, then it's more about you than the people that made it, because it's taking the p!ss out of everyone and I believe that's the way to do it, because it doesn't discriminate that way. I personally had no issues with Big Gay Al or Satan being in a homosexual relationship (Of course he's gay!), but what I will always object to is war for the sake of it, which was what this film was satirising.For me the crude animation was proof that it wasn't meant to be taken seriously, but also adds a charm to it. The setting had a cute rural feel to it as well, that isn't always present in cartoons, where they all seem to be city based. That wintery little town felt homely and familiar in some ways. The producers and writers seem to have lived a life similar to mine and then delivered it to the extreme in animation form.I also thought that making the film a musical was a clever touch, because it really parodied the greats like 'Les Mis', 'Grease' and so on, which just added to the fun.By the way, did everyone else know that with the subtitles on, Kenny was understandable???Yeah, there was probably an important political message and moral to the film, but I didn't think that it was worth getting too bogged down with. I enjoyed it for it's ridiculous concept and daft puns.666.88/1000.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Has a message which Parker and Stone manage to successfully swing it in along with a bunch of side-splitting funny sight gags, musical numbers and flatulence humour.","In the twenty-first century, it appears the world has become more and more cowardly and thus entertainment has attempted to be more about being ""politically incorrect"" than providing worthwhile, honest entertainment. The biggest insult as of date has been the editing of the cartoons of yester-year, due to the smoking and racial depictions that were seen in those masterpieces. Animated series today lack the daring of those programmes and thus children are introduced to juvenile feel-goodery rather than the comic violence provided by the Looney Tunes. Even Sesame Street's Cookie Monster has been put on a diet, due to angry letters from parent's groups. The only cartoon out there that is not afraid to be blunt, satirical and downright naughty is South Park, the crudely animated adventures of four boys in a Colorado mountain town. Each week, creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone bring forth what can be referred to as a warped, politically-charged and happily vulgar version of Peanuts. Yet, looking beyond the construction paper animation and constant swearing, South Park proves to be a witty and funny blend of intelligent, take-no-prisoners humour and even some heart and sweetness thrown in as well. The feature film version of the animated series, appropriately and comically titled Bigger, Longer & Uncut, has a message which Parker and Stone manage to successfully swing it in along with a bunch of side-splitting funny sight gags, musical numbers and flatulence humour.Free from the restraints of television, Parker and Stone are free to enter possibilities that have not been explored before in the series. Yet, they oddly decide to keep it low-key by centering on the four main boys. Kyle and Stan are the straight men and the eight-year-old altar egos of Matt and Trey. Simply put, they may be vulgar and the comments spewing out of their mouths may not be the most friendly, but they're likable and the characters the audience is most able to relate. Even the bigoted slimeball that is Cartman has a sweet side to him, as he is all for the fight against censorship. In a situation almost akin to A Clockwork Orange, once he has been forced to no longer swear, the audience is waiting for him to get his beloved powers back. And finally, there's Kenny the un-sung hero of the story. While his death is used by the parents as a way to exploit their cause, Kenny attempts to stop the war once he learns of Hussein's intentions. The South Park gang have been around for a decade now and yet it's this film that's them at their all-time best.Plenty of what makes the film more than just a longer episode of the series is the way in which Trey Parker and Broadway composer Marc Shaiman turn Bigger, Longer & Uncut into a Disney-style musical. The songs are clever and creative and best of all, they help move the plot along and do not feel like they're just adding to the running time. The opening number ""Mountain Town"", a parody of Beauty and the Beast's beginning, fools the audience into believing that they're about to watch a feel-good family comedy by giving it a tone different from what appears after those first four minutes. After that, the music goes in all sorts of directions. The audience is treated to a profane and flatulence filled homage to Oklahoma!, a march declaring the evils of America's neighbour to the north, a song of admiration towards a figure skater and finally, a combination of the film's best tunes done in the style of Les Miserables. There is even a love ballad played during the end credits, spoofing the typical melodramatic songs that Oscar usually awards (and South Park would, not surprisingly, lose to). Parker understands the musical genre perfectly, as previously evidenced in his student film Cannibal! The Musical and Bigger, Longer & Uncut stands as one of the best the art of cinema has offered.One of the most notable aspects of South Park, along with the humour, is the political satire. In Bigger, Longer & Uncut, Parker and Stone go up against their biggest enemy since going on the air: humourless parent's groups. Along with Stan and Kyle, the two foul-mouthed Colorodians are also represented by the two foul-mouthed Canadians Terrance and Philip. The two characters are not necessarily a parody of South Park, but more-so how easily offended parents view South Park: a badly animated cartoon filled with low brow toilet humour consisting of flatulence jokes and swear words. It may have all of those things, but if people judge it without actually watching it, it's hard to get behind them. If they actually view it, they will find that South Park is satirical and not after all targets, but only those who deserve it. If they actually become offended by what they see, at least they are shown as less intolerant due to actually giving it a chance. Another aspect of parent's groups that Bigger, Longer & Uncut so wonderfully shows is its ability to blame others for their own mistakes. South Park is not intended for children, yet they still manage to find a way to watch it. Instead of blaming Parker and Stone, they should sit down, switch off the television and talk to their children. Sending angry letters to networks and studios that don't read them or waging war with a country which is just providing innocent entertainment isn't going to do any good. Instead, these people are actually giving Parker and Stone more publicity and more targets to make fun of.Then again, if it weren't for the parent's groups, there wouldn't be this marvelous film. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are the two most brave comedians in the television and film business and their magnum opus is the delightful, but meaningful Bigger, Longer & Uncut. This is not just an animated comedy. It's a musical, a message film and an attack on judgmental adults everywhere.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

An example is the main song in the film is called "" Shut your F*****g face uncle F****r and a very catchy number it is too!Also the song sung by the teacher is very funny. The trouble is that after a very good first half hour it get really stupid. it is almost as if they used up their best jokes and songs for the begining and used the unfunny stuff for the remainder of the movie.

What's not to love??,"First things first, this movie is FUNNY. This is not one of those cases where the movie is way worse than the show, in fact this movie surpasses quite a bit of the episodes! 
The movie is funny in several different ways. First, there's the classic South Park ""shock"" humor. This movie gets OUTRAGEOUS and it's hilarious. Then there's actually some pretty clever humor going on. This movie is critical of American culture in a pretty hilarious way. 
To those who are not familiar with South Park, the humor is much more than just cuss words and inappropriate dialogue, they achieve a much higher level of humor (although the cuss words are still hilarious) by critiquing society in a lot of their episodes, and the movie is no different.This movie is one I will never get tired of watching.

Is bigger really better?,"When enough is enough? When it gets boring me thinks. South Park the movie is actually rather funny film. I saw it in theatres when it came out and had a blast with my friends. Later we watched it again from video and laughed again, just not as much the first time. I think the key is, that you don't watch it too often, then it keeps its charm. I saw it again recently and I must admit, that I didn't laugh so hard anymore, but it still does have it's bits.SP is, as you might already know, a feature film of a TV-series of same name. This time Kenny, Kyle, Stan and Eric are trying to stop execution of wrongfully accused Canadian comedians Tarrence and Philip, or the literal Hell will break loose, with Saddam Hussein in the lead with his gay lover Satan. In the middle we see these musical acts, laced with profanity.I think, that this movie would have never worked, if it would have been made as a live action film. The paper cutout style, even tough made with CGI, is just the heart and soul of the whole show. Some thing are better left unaltered.Everything gets mocked in the film: handicapped, racism, religions, American moral values, you name it it's probably in the filmSP:BL&U isn't the funniest comedy around, but it's better than most comedies making fun of these same subjects. The question springs in mind, that did Parker and Stone bite too big piece when they made the film, because in some places it feels like lengthened out TV-episode.

Nothing short of brilliant!,"Thing that surprised me most about ""South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut"" was how incredible brilliant the entire movie was. Like most others I expected nothing more than an extended, average ""South Park"" episode. I was extremely surprised and overwhelmed by the total brilliance of the entire movie.I'm not a that big fan of the ""South Park"" series, even though I really enjoy watching it from time to time, I wouldn't rate it any higher as an 8/10.Probably thing that is most brilliant about ""South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut"" are the songs. I think it originally was intended as one big joke to make the movie a musical. I think the makers never expected the songs to be so totally brilliant and highly fun. Marc Shaiman really surpassed himself and did an amazing job. All of the songs are so totally brilliant, beautiful and extremely funny.Also the story is really brilliant, I mean having Satan and Saddam Hussein being lovers in hell while the Americans are starting a war on the Canadians over the Terrence & Phillip movie ""Asses of Fire""? Brilliant! It's totally ridicules but the message in it is important and works so extremely well, that the movie is really powerful as a political and anti-war movie. The movie might very well be the most entertaining movie with an important and powerful message in it, along with ""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"" I have ever seen.All of the jokes work really well and makes this movie one of the funniest I have seen the last couple of years and is what makes this movie perfectly watchable time after time without loosing any of its power or entertainment value. I truly is one of those movie that I enjoy watching multiple times.Powefull, very funny and with an important and well brought message.

This is the best 2D animated movie of all-time!,"""South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"" (1999), this movie is tied with my favorite 3D animated movie of all time, and takes a place on my top 10 favorite movies of all-time. This is another example of what I consider a perfect movie. You're probably thinking: ""what?! This is your favorite 2D animated movie?"" Let me explain, I don't care how the animation looks in a movie or TV show. Any type of animation can work well if it's entertaining and utilized to it's full potential. ""South Park"" may have low-budget animation, but that does not mean it isn't entertaining. I'll tell you what, ""South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"" fires on all cylinders and then some! Remember, this movie is not for children, but seriously, what kid has not seen it? Or, the TV show for that matter? As long as there's an adult in the room, anyone can watch it at any age. Then as they get older, they'll learn to appreciate the humor much more as time goes on. I first saw this movie when I was in middle school, and I loved it right away. But of course my parents were a bit skeptical about me watching it. Any level-minded child can see that the vulgarity is inappropriate, and know that they can't talk like that in public. If a parent is there to explain to their children, it won't cause any harm. Words are words, and I feel it's important to be straight-forward with kids. Words mean nothing, it's the actions behind them that matter. I love this movie, and I will always love this movie! Usually, I'm not a fan of musicals, but this is one of the few rare ones that I actually enjoy. But it's much more than just a musical. Every time I watch this movie, I always notice something different. That's the sign of a great movie, when it evolves as time goes by. I can watch it 1,000 times in a row and laugh just as hard, if not harder, every single time I view it. Of course, as far as vulgarity and crude humor goes, this movie is on top! Without question, I give it 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you have not seen ""South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"", what are you waiting for? I guarantee you that you'll laugh like you've never laughed before in your life. Strap in, it's one heck of a ride!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A bit overrated, but still a fun film -- if you have an open mind.","'South Park' creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have been major protesters against the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) since one of their early films, 'Orgazmo,' was tagged with an NC-17 rating due to strong language and pervasive sexual content.They have been known to purposely upset the MPAA by a number of methods, but nothing they've done yet reaches the low standards of 'South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut' (1999). This, an animated feature film spin-off of the immensely popular cult television show from Comedy Central, is one of the most deliberately profane, vulgar and controversial films I have ever seen  and, like many controversial films, it is a social satire with bite.That's not to say that it's flawless. The movie is funny, and it has its fair share of hilarious moments, but it isn't great by any means  and often goes searching for laughs in all the wrong places. Still, one has to admire the guts of Parker and Stone  who also voice most of the characters in the movie. I never thought I'd see so many racial stereotypes packed into a single movie  much less an animated one. I never thought I'd see young (albeit animated) children using four-letter words with such pride. I never thought I'd see Saddam Hussein and Satan having a homosexual affair together. Then again, I never thought I'd really see anything remotely close to the content in general that exists within 'South Park' the movie.Fans of the TV show will already be familiar with the characters: four animated kids named Kenny, Kyle, Stan and Cartman. 'Uncut' opens with a cheery musical number and rapidly moves towards vulgarity as the 'innocent' children sneak into an R-rated movie starring their boyhood idols, the foul-mouthed Canadian duo Terrence and Philip, whose combined humor consists of bodily function gags and songs with extreme profanity. ('What did he say?' one of the boys mutters in the theater after the first expletive is heard.)Terrence and Philip's movie becomes number one at the box office, inspiring many local children to start frequently swearing. The parents of South Park decide to launch a campaign named Mothers Against Canada (MAC), with the sole intent of starting a war between the U.S. and our neighbors to the north.If Terrence and Philip are killed, Satan and a recently deceased Saddam Hussein (the character of which is actually represented by real photos of Hussein blended with animation) will rise from the bowels of Hell and take over the world. Terrence and Philip's death somehow  for one reason or another  signifies the coming of the apocalypse, and Kenny  who dies early on in the film, goes to Hell and realizes Satan's plan  rises back to Earth as a ghostly image and tells his friends they must stop the war.I think Trey Parker and Matt Stone are making a statement here, not just about war in general but also about what they believe is 'censorship' by the MPAA and their absurd standards (as one character sings in a musical number, it's okay to show nasty blood and guts  but just don't say any naughty words!). And it's quite obvious that 'Terrence and Philip' are metaphors for the creators of 'South Park,' and the reaction of the public in the film is an eerie foreshadowing of the controversy surrounding the 'real' film's release. It's a clever bit of self-parody that works quite well. I don't think anyone can say that 'South Park' is dumb, even if it's immature.Canadians in 'South Park' are represented by crude stick figures with heads that part at the mouth into two pieces, flapping about as they 'talk.' The animation on the Americans isn't much better  very, very basic drawings. In a bit of a self-referential stab, one of the kids in the film says that he likes Terrence & Philip, but 'the animation sucks.'Some people said 'The Passion of the Christ' was anti-Semitic. Some people said 'Birth of a Nation' was racist (indeed, a recent limited re-release was protested). 'South Park' is both. Packaged along with more than a handful of scatological references are cruel jokes surrounding ethnicity. There are running gags about Jewish residents of South Park, as well as African-Americans and, of course, Canadians. However juvenile their jokes may be, however, Parker and Stone manage to make us laugh  even though we may sometimes feel disturbed by doing so. And one can't help but realize that a lot of the racial jokes are satirical  such as when the Army decides to launch an attack against Canada, and a platoon of black soldiers are used as the 'human shield.' The movie is often trying to say something important, which isn't at all what I had expected  and the notion of America trying to blame other countries for its fault (in this case, Canada) isn't so far-fetched.'South Park' contains less profanity than 'Scarface,' 'Pulp Fiction,' 'GoodFellas,' and 'American History X,' among others, but it's known for its strong language. It constantly pops up on Internet message boards as one of 'the' most profane films of all time, despite the fact that according to official sources it contains less than half the amount of foul language found in Martin Scorsese's 'Casino.'So why are so many people convinced that it has the most profane language of all-time? Well, part of the reason is its length  barely more than 80 minutes  and I'm sure another large issue is the fact that it's animated, and all the profanity is delivered at a rapid speed, mostly by supposed 'children' (who look like big blobs of cardboard). And, unlike more serious films, the profanity in 'South Park' is there for no reason at all  at least not in the same context as dramas. In an interview, director Trey Parker claimed that the intent of 'South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut' was to shock. And indeed, if that was his point then he and co-writer Stone have succeeded  this is a revolutionary advancement in mainstream entertainment. The MPAA is constantly stretching its boundaries, and with 'South Park'  which they originally gave an NC-17 classification prior to certain scenes being deleted by Parker  they really have shamed themselves.I liked 'South Park,' a number of scenes made me laugh and I was very amused overall. No fault can be found in its short length, either  had it dragged out another twenty minutes, perhaps it would have seemed too long, but its current runtime is appropriate given the material. Not all the jokes work, and sometimes the film just goes too far  but if you're looking for something funny, and you have an open mind and aren't easily offended, 'South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut' is a worthy recommendation.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Harsh, Hilarious and deeply critical of many of societies ills","If you like semi twisted black humor used to question many of our thoughts and ideas and how we represent them in our various media forms you should like this film.  By our I mean folks in the USA, and much of the western world.  This is like the TV show in most every way, only more over the top, in that it asks hard questions and masks their seriousness in dark humor often reflecting what a majority of folks think and feel, but are often unwilling to admit to others, or themselves.Good art not only reflects the artists thoughts and feelings, but those of the world they live it, even it that world doesn't want to hear/see it. As far as the quality of the film, it is very well done smooth and sound.  It starts out quick and is so funny it is tough to hear the dialog because EVERYONE is laughing so hard.  It slows down as it progresses and becomes more serious.  The editing is well done.  The sound is better and more interesting than one might think.  The animation is not all ""construction paper cut outs"", but often sophisticated and lush.  Keep in mind they are working with icons and ideas, so it all doesn't need to be overly sophisticated. As expected Trey and Matt pay homage to a myriad of classic images from films of the past and use them to punctuate their own ideas. This film is about good vs. evil, as simple as that.  If you believe in free speech you will applaud this movie, if you think ""this movie has warped my fragile little mind"" then your mind is the little one, not mine!

"Hot fun, smooth songs","South Park belongs to those who love it. Many people don't. That's their problem. I love it, so I will write a positive remark.The episodes are great, but the movie is better. Stone and Parker saved the best jokes for the film and it has an intelligent storyline too. Basically the film makes fun of itself. The whole thing about violence and cursing being bad for young children is depicted beautifully. Problem with South Park is that after an episode of 20 minutes you're bound to have enough. That is why they made a number of beautiful songs to break the tension and liven things up. That is what makes this movie so great. And get a load of the special effects. They're amazing. Whoah!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A very good movie, but...","I thought this movie was extremely funny. Also the songs in this movie are excellent, and entertaining. The only problem I have with this movie is the fact that it got an R-rating from the MPAA. I feel that there were portions of this movie that should have only been in a NC-17 version. These scenes could have been edited out without a loses to the story. If you have young children, use extreme caution when deciding wether or not to let them see this film.

Crude and Unapologetic Comedy,"""South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"" pushes the boundaries of humor, catering to a niche taste with its irreverent and lowbrow comedy. This animated feature fearlessly dives into taboo topics, delivering a consistent stream of laughs. Fans of the show will appreciate its audacious style, while others may find it lacking in intellectual depth. The movie employs sharp social commentary, satirizing various aspects of modern society. However, its humor is more suited for those who embrace South Park's trademark irreverence. ""South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"" knows its target audience well, offering a no-holds-barred experience that revels in crude humor. If you enjoy boundary-pushing comedy, this film will entertain, but be aware that its humor may not resonate with those seeking more sophisticated wit.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Don't be fooled by the expletives,"Being a fan of the show it could be assumed that I'm biased towards this film but I'm sure that lots of people will enjoy this movie because it is both a wonderful political satire as well as being a great exposé on the censorship issue in America and the double-standards that American society has. I love Mrs. Browlowski's line near the end when she says to the troops at the USO show ""Graphic, deplorable violence is O.K. as long as nobody says any naughty words. That's what this war is all about."" Sarcasm, yah can't beat it.Another thing that makes this movie great is the way in which it sends up other animated films. The cliché Disney films of the 40's and 50's where boy meets girl but girl is in love with another boy etc. etc. This is evident in Stan's obsession over Wendy and his hilarious attempts to woo her but only ending up vomiting all over her. LOL. Also the songs are, more or less, parodies of the kind of songs found in these cheesy Disney flicks that appeal to the younger generation. For example, Satan's INCREDIBLY cheesy song of hope, 'Up There' is highly inappropriate for a creature that is supposed to be pure evil.In short, this film can be watched again and again for a good laugh but also as a great social commentary. I hope people don't judge this film too harshly because it has swear words in it. A LOT of swear words. It's not like other films where the swear words are only added to appeal to the young demographic and add nothing to the plot. After all, this movie is about censorship so why not say the F word hundreds of times?:p The critic's actually loved this movie and so did I.8.5/10",,Anonymous,Animation
A rave about South Park's uncompromising nature and well-crafted script,"No film in entertainment history has able to captivate while being repellent, to instruct through nonsense, or to present a visual feast through chicken scrawling like ""South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut"" has. Ingenious in its simplicity, this movie unleashes a viciously inviting mixture of raw humor and unvarnished truth on an unexpecting society.  The self-referential use of the ""Terrence and Phillip"" meta-movie created an oddly haunting yet uncompromising look at our society and ourselves, forcing viewers to redefine their traditional concepts of entertainment and decency (while simultaneously busting a gut).  This movie is truly groundbreaking.How the establishment let this one slip through to the public is beyond me, but I applaud their glorious mistake.

Disappointing,"I was all set to be blown away by outrageous South Park humor.So much for expectations.I have 3 gripes with the film:1) Spouting profanities through the entire movie will not shock anybody who is familiar with the series. Ultimately the profanity gets real boring. It had a dulling effect.2) 1 or 2 musical numbers would have been campy fun. By the 3rd and 4th songs I was squirming in my seat. Can you say tedious? And much of the songs were rather forced.3) Biggest complaint....over-the-top on the gay-bashing. I do no want political correctness and have no problem with the way gays are treated in the TV series. But the Satan/Saddaam sodomy scenario, not to mention the use of the word 'faggot' in casual conversation was extremely annoying. And Big Gay Al was just part of the evil townsfolk, a relative non-entity.Again, disappointing. There was a chuckle or 2, but not enough to justify the price of admission.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Just the first ten minutes are enough to firmly convince you this movie should not be seen by kids.  And, in a weird sort of way, this movie is a musical.

THERE ARE NO GOOD LAUGHS TO BE FOUND HERE. It took me a while to figure out where I had heard all those awful sorry excuses for jokes before. But, then it hit me. It was in fifth grade when we were lined up to go take a bathroom break. And the rest of them were from when we came back from that break and the teacher played some sex ed tape.

The most dangerous and cunning comedy that I've seen in years.,"After you see this movie, I guarantee that you will leave the theater, speechless, for a while. South Park delivers a comedy that holds no limits and explodes in a violent assault on every race, creed, group, sex, or affiliation and doesn't give in, ever. If you are somebody who is easily hurt when hearing constant bashing of minorities and foreigners or if you are offended by the use of foul language, don't see this movie. For the rest of the public though, this is the best comedy that I've seen in a long time. Like any other South Park episode, the movie has an elaborate story that is completely bizarre and impossible, but believable enough to enjoy. Unlike the television show though, this movie holds no limits on cussing and cleanliness, along with the fact that it is a musical. Unless you are a very uptight individual, the movie will make you laugh until your ribs hurt and then you will laugh some more. I've always felt that I knew dirty comedy, but there were sexual bashes in this movie that I didn't even understand. This is truly an excellent work of comedy in its darkest form. The fact that Trey Parker and Matt Stone used this movie as a way to get back at the stupid MPAA is even better. Well I congratulate Parker and Stone, because this movie was incredible and made me a much bigger fan of the series. Better than Austin Powers and Big Daddy, if you're a fan of cutting-edge comedy, South Park is your summer ticket. I give it a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

And anyone who has read about the Vietnam war will understand the real meaning of ""Operation Human Shield"" near the movie's end.  There's five billion of us on this planet, which means that if nothing else, there is a lot of sex going on.  It's something we all are interested in, and most of us do it as much as we can.

A superb profanity ridden satrire of censorship and cancel culture,"In this 1999 big-screen version of the classic adult animated series, Kyle, Stan, Kenny, and Cartman go to see the Canadian R-Rated Terrance & Phillip Movie: Asses of Fire, which influences them into spewing a lot of obscenities while in school. With the boy's mothers being contacted, and learning about their behavior, Kyle's mother Sheila Broflovski forms the Mothers Against Canada (M. A. C.), which leads to the arrest of Terrance & Phillip while they're on U. S. soil, which eventually leads to Canada violently retaliating, and the United States, declaring war on their neighbors and kicking off World War III. Unbeknownst to everyone, lovers Satan and Sassam Hussein plans to use the War to bring about the apocalypse, and it's left to the boys to prevent it from happening.After the edgy, contentious animated series had run for just two years and had garnered a loyal fanbase worldwide, series creators and co-writers Trey Parker and Matt Stone were fairly expedient in setting about producing a big-screen full-length movie version, unlike Matt Groening who waiting far too long to bring his own classic cartoon show, The Simpsons to cinema theatres. It would seem appropriate given how controversial and edgy South Park was and still is that Parker and Stone would choose the issue of Censorship as the topical focus of their idiosyncratic, vulgar, and caustic brand of satirical humor.Essentially a musical as much as it is a comedy, the movie opens with a beautifully executed parody of the Disney movie franchise, which injects the right tone of sickly sweetness, as a cheery Stan Marsh sings about living in his hometown of South Park, Colorado as he makes his way to meet his three friends, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman so they might go see the new Terrance & Phillip movie. It brilliantly subverts the genre and acts as something of a contrast to the more ribald, foul-mouthed craziness that is to swiftly come. And Parker and Stone hit you right between the eyes with a sublimely rude and indecent musical number as performed by the Canadian cartoon heroes. This of course acts as a springboard to essentially set the ball rolling in terms of the plot, which involves our main protagonists facing the wrath of their mothers, after their subsequent use of foul language lands them in hot water and inspires a morally outraged Sheila Broflovski to start a campaign and crusade to essentially bring Terrance & Phillip to justice.It's likely no coincidence with both Parker and Stone's chief influences as filmmakers and Satirists would be and still are Monty Python, who on the release of their classic surreal satirical masterpiece, Life of Brian came under fire from The Festival of Light, a religious organization founded by the journalist and author Malcolm Muggeridge, and more notably clean-up campaigner Mary Whitehouse who is used to parallel her, essentially being their own alternative as well to Marge Simpson. The movie sharply looks at the salient issue of scapegoating, a pitfall that has almost come at the expense of controversial rockstars like Ozzy Osbourne Cooper and Marilyn Manson.As previously stated, leading the charge of moral outrage is Kyle's mother Sheila Broflovski, voiced brilliantly by Mona Marshall, who is insurmountably shrill and overbearing. Aptly personifying the self-righteous self-appointed paragons of virtue who want anything they deem the least bit offensive or unseemly as worthy of being censored. A sentiment that is sharply satirized in the academy award nominated song, Blame Canada. Parker and Stone, as they always have, take no prisoners as they take piercingly searing swipes at the very same people who have taken Umbridge with their satirical TV series. The movie is chock-full of hilarious moments, and they manage to do what would seemingly be the impossible, as being more outrageous and potentially offensive than their show. Not least of all in a moment where Cartman reprises his Kyle's Mom song from the TV series, which incorporates how the song would be performed in other parts of the world, with comedic panache.South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut is a superb satirical takedown of cancel culture. Something which today, now more than ever seems all the more relevant. Particularly given the nature of woke culture that has sadly permeated contemporary society and has become a blight on freedom of expression. In this respect, it hasn't aged, with its themes as bitingly salient today as it was back just before the turn of the century.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's Not Just a Cartoon,"When people think cartoons they automatically draw memories from their youth; bright colors, fantastic heroes and lovely princesses. Boy and girls of a certain age love the magical kingdom of Disney and the sly humor of Warner Bros. Saturday morning cartoons. Today, with the advent of computer digital imagery cartoons have risen to a whole new level of experience for the young. But we all have to grow up someday I guess.That is unless of course you are a fan of Comedy Central's savage satirical cartoon show South Park (1997-Present). Drawn in a crude, cardboard style and centered around three foul-mouthed boys from a Colorado mountain town, South Park brought a level of edginess to the animated arts not seen since The Simpsons (1989-Present). The level of South Park's accomplishments is even more impressive when you consider all the episodes are written by two men, college friends Trey Parker and Matt Stone.A few years after their runaway success the duo decided they wanted to green-light a feature length movie focusing on the four boys and the chaotic town they call home. What resulted was arguably one of the funniest animated-musical-comedies to come out in the latter part of the 20th century.The story of South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut begins with the four boys being refused at the movie theater for wanting to watch a rated-R movie. The stars of the movie are a pair of Canadian comics, Terrance and Phillip, who traffic in the lowest of low comedy. So naturally the boys don't want to watch a watered down TV version a year after the fact. They manage to sneak into the Bijou and are exposed to the movie which sets the parents off on a crusade against the entire nation of Canada. The boys Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman (All voiced by Parker and Stone) must then put a stop to things before everything spirals out of control and Hell itself engulfs them all.The world in which the boys inhabit is full of hyperbole, anarchic bedlam, and catchy, brilliantly written musical numbers. Avid aficionados of classic musicals, Trey Parker and Matt Stone wanted to convey that affection at a time when musicals weren't in vogue. The heads of Paramount Pictures were not 100% on board with the decision yet still slated South Park for a June release.Weeks after opening night, reports of underage teens sneaking into the film began to circulate causing a bit of controversy for the film. The MPAA originally slapped an NC-17 rating on the Guinness Book of World Record holder for most curse words in an animated film. That decision was later rescinded but didn't put parents' minds at ease. There were minor protests here and there but overall the film was a rousing success, garnering praise from critics and an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song.Parker and Stone would later go on to pen a Tony Award winning musical The Book of Mormon and create an impressive marionette-themed action satire called Team America: World Police (2004) which also collected accolades and controversy. This is in addition to reaching new heights with the Emmy Award winning South Park for fourteen more years.

"Good, mindless entertainment","The whole theatre was laughing all through the movie at the preview screening I attended, so I can sense how much this movie is going to gross. A lot.The writing is excellent and the characters are so much more broad than the TV series, even though the movie is still only 76 minutes long. One surprising thing; Scott Rudin, who did A Civil Action and The Firm, produced this. It's obvious that critics are going to bash South Park, but ignore them and see it anyway, it's an excellent way to blow an hour fifteen minutes (and $5)+ (GOOD THINGS) 1.) The writing 2.) Parker and Stone's voice work 3.) How it insults everything, no one feels left out 4.) Marc Shaiman's score 5.) The terrible animation(BAD THINGS) 1.) Nonstop swearing 2.)

"Good, but could have been so much better","This film was made in the first three seasons of ""South Park"" and the funny thing is that Trey Parker and Matt Stone say they hate the first three seasons of the show. I don't know if they've ever said that about this movie. Butters appears in this film, but has no lines. It's a shame, because Butters is my favorite character and it was when he had a role that the show really took off. The plot is that Kyle's mother wages war on Canada when the Terrance and Philip movie inspires the kids to swear.This used to be the animated movie with the most swearing until ""Sausage Party"" came out. I wonder if Trey Parker is mad at those guys? ""Casino"", ""Summer of Sam"", ""Wolf Of Wall Street"" have literally THRICE as many f-words as this film and this IS a film about swearing! The closest there ever came to a second ""South Park"" movie was the Imaginationland trilogy but that was never intended to be a movie. My favorite joke is still, ""Haven't you ever heard of the Emancipation Proclamation?"" This is followed by, ""I don't listen to hip hop"". ***",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

I have never in my life been more offended and liked it.,"A lot of people are going to hate this movie. Two of the people I viewed ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut"" with nearly walked out of the theater. Unless you are a sociopath, this movie will DEEPLY offend you - but then that's the point, moreso it is not only offense for offense sake either.I consider this film one of the greatest possible commentaries on the modern world, served in the very palatable form of off the wall comedy. Indeed, it is in how it cuts to the quick and how deeply it can hurt that we learn something about society and ourselves. It starts off easily approachable and ends off with dildo jokes, racial slurs, sexist jokes, horribly tasteless jokes, ghastly humor involving Satan in a sexual relation with Sadaam....it goes on and on and on....I laughed so very hard, and I'm still figuring out why.... That's the hallmark of a meaningful film. Now, is it good? That's a matter of personal taste - some people simply will NOT be able to swallow this movie. I liked it quite a bit, but am hesitant to recommend it.And for the love of all that is pure, PLEASE do NOT bring CHILDREN or TEENAGERS to this movie. This film should be rated NC17, IMHO. It's good, but it's almost on a pornographic level from time to time.Viva la Resistance!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"South Park:Fouler, Over the Top and Still Funny","As Stan Marsh himself would say: ""Dude! This is pretty f****d up right here!""  And that describes this movie.  Never have I cringed and laughed so hard all during the same film.  Parker and Stone manage to be vulgar, funny, outlandish, funny, gross, funny, extremely disgusting, funny, childish, funny, inordinately blasphemous, funny and just plain rude, all within 90 minutes.  And oh, did I mention the film was funny?  Many critics were right in their assessment that beneath the crude and crass exterior hides a surprisingly witty satire that takes aim at everything from our preconceived notions of right and wrong to the hypocritical attitude we have towards the media.  The film spares no one and in the process provides some truly hilarious moments.  Unfortunately many of the gags are unnecessarily vulgar to the point of being downright embarrassing, but then again, that's probably the point.  Maybe...  The musical numbers are a hoot, especially the duo with Terrance and Philip with a rather peculiar musical bent.  I'm still trying to decide whether or not to recommend this film.  It is definitely not for everybody, and ABSOLUTELY NOT for kids.  They wouldn't understand the humour and the extremely foul language and vulgarity taken out of context would certainly give them all the wrong ideas.  This is an ADULT film in every sense of the word.  If you're a fan of the show, go see it.  Otherwise spend your money elsewhere.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Funny as hell, the first few times...","""South Park: Bigger, Longer, & Uncut"" is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I laughed my ass off the first time I saw it. In this film, the parents of South Park declare war on Canada after a movie starring Terrence and Phillip, Canada's star fart-joke comedians and only source of income, corrupts the children with foul language. This movie has the same style of humor as the television show it is based on, only now Trey Parker and Matt Stone don't have to abide by broadcasting decency laws.This is one of those movies that has parent and religious groups going spastic over the content. While it does have a lot of vulgarity, the movie also has an underlying message about censorship and first amendment rights. If you watch this movie looking for a good time, and not a soul-enlightening experience, you'll be fine.The only problem with this film is that it lacks replay value. Once you have seen it two or three times, it is easy to lose interest. Jokes won't have the same kick. But for some reason the songs never get old. The funniest part of this movie is the musical numbers, my personal favorite being ""Blame Canada"" (which went on to be nominated for an Oscar).This movie is definitely one of my favorite animated movies. I can only hope they decide to make a sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Awesome, trashy flick!!!","I have seen some trashy films but this takes the cake. This movie is everything every rebellious overgrown adolescent ever wanted from life. Swearing, rebelling and good friends. This movie has drawn a lot of criticism and it is well warranted. The vulgarity is out of hand and it's obvious the creators went as close to the edge of NC17 as possible. Ironically I haven't heard any criticism on it being a bad film. It was actually a very good movie with a lot of cleverness and originality. This movie is not made for the squeamish or the over-sensitive. This is just good old-fashion profanity that our movies have been lacking in the past decade since people in office decided to blame murder and suicide of kids on the movie industry instead of pointing the finger at the parents. I had tears I was laughing so hard. The new Austin Powers can't touch this. I'll have to see it again as I missed so much of the film laughing.

Stick with it as it starts to hit it's stride and look better after a couple of seasons.And if you haven't seen the film, that is a must see!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A funny continuation of the show with more musical numbers and a great message,"This movie is a continuation of the brilliance and humor from Matt and Trey. This movie has more musical numbers than the show - and it's great. This movie came out during the early stages of South Park so it can come off a bit immature and childish than their later seasons from Season 6 and on. I wasn't expecting to hear George Clooney's voice, that was a pleasant surprise. I thought it was pretty cool how they combined 3D-rendered animations with 2D when they show Kenny going to hell.The movie goes by really quick and is pretty short. It's quite fast-paced with a lot of things happening one after the other. I liked how they were able to make it feel like one long episode instead of 3 episodes combined into one. And of course the message/moral of the story is a good one. So basically Kyle's mom goes on a crusade and tries to blame the Terrance and Phillip show, eventually blaming the entirety of Canada, for the reason why their children are using curse words and obscenities. Eventually there's a full on ridiculous war between the US and Canada. The moral of the story is that instead of parents sitting down with their kids and talking about the things they watched and experienced in the Terrance and Phillip show, they would rather blame the people who made it because it's probably easier. This moral ties into the violence and language that is sometimes depicted in video games and movies. Like the time GTA came out and parents (and even some political figures) were blaming the video game and its creators. When really it's the parents that should be taking responsibly for letting their children play the games in the first place and not talking to them to make sure that the video game isn't warping their mind and their view of the world. Recommended especially if you're a South Park fan. Raw score: 7.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
childish comedy but addresses very real problems even relevant 17 years later,starts off like any season of the show typical slapstick childish comedy with a lot of foul language which makes you pee your pants laughing and then starts addressing the real issue. its simply a season of south park condensed as a movie loved Satan's character. over censorship is a problem rampant today as well and when i saw depictions of mahatma Gandhi (not stating context to avoid spoilers) even i thought that it would've been censored in India but the topic was so well handled that by the end this thought seemed juvenile.

A Satire for the Ages,"An elite social satire if there ever was one, ""South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"" gleefully marries jaw-dropping obscenity with masterful manipulation of the traditional musical genre, holding a searing blowtorch to misplaced parenting, failed political and religious institutions, and other bastions of hypocrisy worthy of its elevated contempt. Now over twenty years old, its full frontal assault somehow feels no less fresh and relevant than it did upon its release.Among its many elite strengths, it's the debauched manipulation of the musical genre that distinguishes this ""South Park"" vehicle from other satires, parodies and spoofs, and even from the ""South Park"" TV series itself: Its songs are relentless, hysterical in bite, and enter the ear cloaked like wolves in sheep's clothing.While certainly arguable, ""South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"" may have found its prolific creators at the absolute height of their powers. To this day, it resides in the top tier of film's most brilliant and influential social satires. - (Was this review of use to you? If so, let me know by clicking ""Helpful."" Cheers!)

What a relief ... lovely,"This movie just hits the spot. This movie is funny, yet sophisticated - its contains loads of obscenity, yet it carries important messages.When Eric, Kyle, Stan and Kenny goes to see the two Canadians -  Terrance & Phillip in ""Arses of Fire"" - they learn some real lovely obscene expressions, which they unload at poor Mr. Garrison the next day at school... and hell breaks loose (so to speak).Anyway this movie treats the whole who-is-to-blame-for-what-our-children-watch issue so great. To put things to the extreme, they blame Canada, and decide to execute Terrance & Phillip, which leads to war between USA and Canada.The story is told in these exaggerated terms, and ethnic groups and lots of individuals gets a rough word on the way - everything in a great spirit of political non-correctness. It folds South Park itself into the movie and so pictures USA's reaction to the South Park series, while still holding on to a general problem, the who-is-to-blame-thing - clever. But the really surprise in this ""musical"" is the music - its awesome! As this writing-hour, one of the songs has been nominated for an Oscar - and that is no surprise.I can only urge you to see this movie. Yea yea there's a lot of obscene words, but that's not directly what makes this movie good, and yet indirectly it is.I have 3 main points that makes this movie worth seeing - even if you're not a South Park incarnate.1) The music2) The real issue of the movie, so elegantly pictured by exaggeration.3) The numerous small funny scenes.I give this 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"South Park: Funnier, Dirtier and Not for Kids","There's a number of obvious reasons this movie is rated R. The fact that literally every other word, is an obscenity they weren't allowed to show on Television.  The plot is actually a lot stronger than one would expect. And although the movie is quite vulgar, towards the end, a few morals are learned... You'll have to see it to know what I mean. I saw it with a group of 16 year olds, and we all loved it. The vulgarity is nothing new to teenagers, except that it's just placed so randomly, (you'll know what I mean if you see it), that it's hilarious, which will leave your kids singing the Terrence Phillip ""Uncle F'er"" song.  It's hard to tell people not to see this, because it is honestly the funniest movie I have ever seen (and believe me, I've seen WAY TOO MANY movies, old and recent).  But on the other hand...

"Long, but explains my thoughts.","This Movie is Excellent. I am a big fan of South Park(series), But the show has lost it's humor a little bit. This Movie is what the series needs to survive. South Park is a change from the low level violence/humor combination of the Simpsons. South Park(series) was right on the edge of high level violence/humor combination, But(in Australia) it didn't quite make it(because in Australia the swear words are beeped out), it wasn't offensive enough to get the high level rating. The Movie, however, gets the high level violence/humor, but this isn't why it gets the 10 in my books. It gets 10 because the way it delves into subjects that most people start of by saying: ""Hey, What If...?"" and your friend replies: ""Yeah, That Would Be Really Cool"". That's what attracts most people. It also scores a 10 for the way its 4 main characters are set. They're all different, they all have their different problems and handle them in different way, But they also have different lives.

A message in a South Park movie?!??,"I just went to see this movie tonight and I must say that I was very much impressed with the fact that it actually had a message!  I didn't really expect it to contain any redeeming social value, so in that sense I was very much impressed.  As I saw it, Matt and Trey very effectively spoke out against society's willingness to blame anyone but those who are truly responsible, as seen in the Columbine shootings, etc. However, I must also say that I do feel that the MPAA may have been right in this case.  South Park truly was ""uncut"" as the title claims and the ""adult"" language and crudeness were there as I have never seen before in a film.  In other words, it was fully deserving of the R rating it received (if not the NC-17 rating it didn't..). I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone ""of age"" or to anyone who knows that they can handle the extremity with which the film's message is expressed.

"Hilarious, yet strangely heartwarming, sweet and thought-provoking","Heartwarming and sweet should normally be the last things you'd hear when talking about South Park. But this movie somehow manages to mix in that with the classic South Park elements of biting social commentary and hilarious hijinks.South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut is a ""prequel"" (I use the term loosely as it's never directly stated as such) to the TV show. It follows Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny as they sneak into a Canadian R-rated movie and learn all these mean bad words like f*** and s***. They later get the whole school to watch it, which leads the parents to form a organization that causes a war to break out between Canada and the US. So it's up to the four kids to save the world from destruction.The plot takes SEVERAL twists and turns which I dare not spoil her because all the fun of the movie will be ruined. It also has several side plots, which normally should be bad for this type of movie. But they seamlessly combine it into the main plot line that you don't mind.The Academy Award nominated soundtrack is the highlight here. The songs are catchy, quotable, and, of course, hilarious and crude in classic South Park fashion.In the end, this film is by far one of the best animated films I've seen, and one of the best TV adaptations ever.10 out of 10 *MATTHEW'S SEAL OF AWESOME*",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

If you're easily offended, then don't go see this, because it picks on just about everybody.  It was very artistic, the construction paper looks excellent on the big screen, and even though it's animated, it has some great special effects, especially Kenny's trip to Hell, and the Hell sequences in general.  The fire mixed very well with the animation. The musical numbers were mostly great, but they could have done without the Saddam Hussein song or the Satan song.  The rest were really funny.  The Saddam/Satan thing got kind of old, but Kenny giving advice to Satan was good.  There are a lot of hidden and ""in"" jokes for fans of the show. Lots and lots of profanity.  And you finally get to see Kenny's face and hear his voice sans hood.  I'm still trying to decide if that was a good move or not. A GREAT cameo by George Clooney.

If you're a fan of this show and have not seen this movie, shame on you. Go get it now. If you don't know what South Park is, shame on you also! You're missing out on something great. However, if you do know what South Park is, and hate it- well, this is more of the same. However, I would recommend this outrageous musical(!) to anyone who loves those foul-mouthed 8 year olds, or anyone who just wants a good laugh. Songs include: Uncle F**a, I Can Change by Saddam himself, and What Would Brian Boitano Do?",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Trey Parker proves him self to be a genius to write such an incredible score; Elton John and Tim Rice should go to Trey Parker for advice next time Disney asks them to write a score, hell, Disney should just go strait to Parker.

"It's nice to see South Park going back to it's... ""vulgar"" roots.","Ever since I first saw Spirit of Christmas (long before Trey and Matt got their deal with Comedy Central), I was a bit disappointed when I finally saw the first couple of episodes on TV.  Something was... missing.  Though it's far beyond the limit of good taste, I found this movie to go back to it's roots... and hilarilously funny.The musical aspect of the movie (with it's parodies of Sound of Music and Les Miserables) was refreshing and very nicely done, though I could have done without the whole Saddam Hussian number.  And the various puns and references to old South Park episodes (like the Mecha-Streisand poster when the kids first see the ""Asses of Fire"" movie) made me realized that even after three viewings, there was still things that I missed.Trey and Matt should be proud, this is a wonderful attempt to bring South Park onto the big screen.

A great musical!,"Musicals are rare these days and so for this film to turn up and be so good is a treat, in fact it is probably one of the best musicals I've ever seen. The songs are all so brilliant and much of the hilarity of the movie comes from watching top heavy cartoon characters with fat stumpy legs trying to do Gene Kelly dance routines. You get a feeling that Parker and Stone have an ambivalent attitude towards the musical for while they show how stupid some of the dances and tunes can be they are done with a wonderful exuberance.The film is also marvelous because it not only takes a dig at the so many stupid things like moral panics, xenophobia, Bryan Adams and such but the musical genre is one of celebration and the film is a celebration of so much, of freedom of speech, friendship, of being young, of being young and learning swearwords for the first time, and of so many other things.Whereas films like Austin Powers are similar in that they have a rapid fire of crude one liners and visual gags you aren't left with the empty feeling of those films because beneath all South Park's expletives and jokes this movie has a plot and a hell of a lot to say.

"Not for all ages, but hysterical","Not being the classic viewer of cartoon movies (Aside from The Simpsons) I was positively surprised by South Park. Certainly it's not a movie made for all ages, due to the many expletives quoted, but I agree with the movie's subject matter of making fun of everything. I couldn't quit laughing during most of the film. The *Blame Canada* is really hysterical, isn't it?Without spoiling it for nobody, I found especially remarkable the Sadam Hussein, Winona Ryder and Bill Gates's appearances.What really struck me about South Park was that it actually was made, and in the prude US!!! - no offense intended ok? From this other side of the Atlantic looks like most of US people are easy to outrage by the most harmless stuff, so I found amazing this movie made it through all the puritanism and was not banned from being screened in the States.

(This is so vulgar even a drunken sailor would be impressed.) What really had the audience in stitches were the musical numbers. Yes, I said musical. These are grade-A Rogers and Hammerstein inspired songs. And not one lyric is really fit for print. Not only is it funny, it is incredibly intelligent too.

There will not be a more poignant, more hilarious piece of celluloid coming to theaters any time soon.

Totally unexpected is the excellent song score, the best since ""Beauty and the Beast"" (and the songs are just as hilarious as the rest of the movie).

Before you start saying ""that kid shouldn't have seen that movie, it's too offensive"" or something like that, let me continue. I am a huge fan of the show, so I went to see the movie on the second day after its release. I was expecting a very offensive movie, from what the press had said. And they were right. However, it's not like I was spewing profanities after seeing it, go badmouthing other religions and races. By all means, parents, don't take your 7-year olds, but responsible viewers can get younger than you might think. Now, on with the review. This movie was brilliant. As a Canadian, this movie did not offend me at all; it's not supposed to be taken seriously. The musical numbers were classics (I bought the soundtrack right after seeing the movie) and there were actually some awesome effects in there. But above all, there is the moral of the movie.

True genius disguised in coarseness,"This movie's brilliance lies on two tracks. First, it takes the biting and somewhat subtle societal parodies of the Simpsons and Beavis-and-Butthead to a new level.

Direct rip-offs include at least two scenes from Les Miserables, one from Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Sound of Music, Beauty and the Beast, etc.To truly appreciate this magnificent commentary on modern society, you must have a well-rounded exposure to movies, music, literature, and current events.

I'm no fan of musicals (except for some children's classics), but this one is something else.In this movie there are no stupid jokes that were simply put in to fill time; each joke is aimed at a specific target, which is ridiculed appropriately (like Saddam Hussein, Satan, Bill Gates and the American way of living to name a few). It's true that these people or situations have been subject to the writers' caustic humour many a times in the series, but it is in this movie that all the jokes have been collected together and bound into a single 90 minute feature film with a plot which has a beginning, middle and ending and keeps you rolling on the floor laughing for the whole of its length.Overall a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Devilishly funny,"Movies just don't get much funnier than this. It's a witty send-up of American entertainment, with 14 musical numbers in various musical formats. It's also a vicious, right-on commentary on the MPAA ratings system, on Canada, and on American patriotism.I have always liked the show on Comedy Central, but it has been a little uneven lately. Nevertheless, this is proof that Trey Parker and Matt Stone are for real.The TV show has often been the target of cultural worriers - the film answers back with a broadside: it features as much profanity, violence, blasphemy and deliberately offensive behavior as any film I've ever seen, and it presents it's critics as morons who found organizations like Mothers Against Canada and end up inviting the apocalypse.The boys sneak into an R-rated Canadian movie, starring their heroes Terrence and Philip, and emerge with an obscene  vocabulary that sends their parents into a tizzy. The parents then do what parents do best: engage in a fit of blaming other people. They end pointing their finger at Canada - it's about as logical a target as ""the culture,"" ""the media"" or ""the guns"" - and start a war.There is an absolutely  hilarious sequence involving the US military operation (the general says something like, ""OK, 14th squadron, you're our shield - you're at the vanguard of this operation. Where are you guys?"" Every black soldier tentatively raises his hand.)Cartman is forced to test an anti-obscenity V-chip implanted directly into his brain - the results are predictable, but pretty funny, though it's a bit of a crib from A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.Maybe the best scenes involve Kenny, who dies and goes to hell, where Satan and Saddam Hussein are involved in a torrid romance - Saddam is a randy, insensitive lout, and Satan is the insecure, manipulated, oft-abused ""female"" of the pairing.Brilliant, twisted and immensely satisfying.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hysterical Movie--One of the Summer's Best!,"SouthPark: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is one hysterical movie.  The wonderfully cheap animation is combined with state-of-the-art computer effects and an all-around howlingly funny plotline.  This was one of those movies that most people in the theatre couldn't catch their breaths going from one laugh to the next.  I don't want to give away too much, but I'll just entice...The movie is centered around the new Terrance and Phillip movie, which just like Southpark, is the movie form of a popular TV show.  Of course, the kids have to sneak in because of the ""naughty"" language, and they are, of course, corrupted.  Complete with social commentary, the parents, instead of blaming themselves for not paying enough attention to their children, turn to blame the most guilty culprit: Canada.  They pulled a lot of material from ""Not without my Anus"" for this movie.This movie is full of really funny songs and great parodies.  The musical soundtrack parallels a few Disney Musicals (I noticed Satan's song was a lot like ""Out There"" from Hunchback), and Les Miserables (a few songs of the kids when they go to war).The movie ties together many other episodes of SouthPark, and there are some jokes which only diehard fans will pick up on (hope you all remember Brian Boitano).  However, my friend who barely ever watches the show still found it really funny.Warning: This movie is definitely adult-only.  Don't take the kids to see this one--not only is it not appropriate, but they won't understand half of the jokes.

The Makers of this Film Need Your Money More than You Do,"The cleverest -- and, curiously enough, the most offensive -- thing about the ""South Park"" movie was in tacking on a mendacious ""message"" about free speech:  a cheap gimmick for sanctimonious self-justification, letting the writers masquerade their shortcomings as virtues (they can't come up with anything better than to repeat words they think are ""naughty"";  and they probably giggled the whole time they wrote it, not only at their childish ""naughtiness"" but at those who would get suckered in and throw their -- or their parents' -- hard-earned money at it).  Fans of this movie should save their $$$ and create their own fun by making milk squirt out their nose, or by kicking the crutches out from under a cripple, or ""experimenting"" on a puppy, or taking a mirror to their outhouses to watch themselves defecate.

"South Park: Funnier, Smarter and More Musical","I do not care for the South Park TV show (too much puerile humor, talking poop, and vomit jokes).  I do not like movies with a lot of swearing.  I went to this movie with low expectations and it warped my fragile little mind with all the obscenity and disgusting behavior.After it warped my mind, I found this to be one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.   The obscenity works because it is a movie about the censorship of the Terrance and Phillip (T&P) movie due to that movie's use of obscenities.  So, they have to show T&P's obscene movie.  The South Park movie is then able to poke fun at its own bad language, how it affects children, and people's criticism of it by showing the silliness of T&P and the ridiculous reactions to the T&P movie.The songs in this movie are great.  The music is a good as any Disney movie and most of them are hilarious.  ""What Would Brian Boitano Do?"" is great musically, creatively and its very funny.  The Les Miz parody, La Resistance, is a brilliant medley that make you want to cheer when it is over. The way T&P go overboard on the obscenities is extremely funny.  I especially liked the song Uncle F**ka which is mostly obscenities.I have watched this movie several times and I laughed each time.  My recommendation is to watch this movie at least twice.

Not only was it better than I thought would be (I was expecting a 90 minute version of the TV show), but it addressed (and made fun of) a lot of the SP critics - and of course, Barbara Streisand.  So far, even the movie reviewers like it, which I think says a lot.

The funniest movie ever,"South Park has to be the funniest movie I have ever seen.  The audience was practically rolling in the aisles at times and actually applauded for several sections.  It was amazing.  Although it doesn't get the acknowledgement for it, this is a very intelligent movie too.  It parodies all kinds of shows.  A good portion is taken almost directly from Les Miserables and several songs are right out of Disney movies.  There are even parodies of traditional musicals like Oklahoma.  Satan has a pretty good voice too.  One warning however.  Do not see this movie if you are easily offended.  The aim of the movie is to offend and it does this very well. However, it makes fun of absolutely everyone, so no one can be offended more then anyone else and it leaves sort of a feeling of togetherness.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 16.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Funny, original.. but NOT for the kids under 14","If I had previewed this movie, I would not have taken my daughter to see it.. At 10, she is very mature but the constant obscenity even got to her.I laughed so hard I cried and, as most of the humor was far over her head or beyond her level of experiences, all she could do was stare at me as if to say: ""What's so funny??""  There were so many songs I thought I was at a musical.. some of them were very clever.All will be equally offended by the racial jokes: Blacks, Canadians, Whites, Wasps, Jews.. there is something to offend everyone (except Native Americans, and that probably will be in South Park II)Some of the sexual material was crude at best, and the movie would not have suffered had it been deleted: The scene with Sadaam and the devil in bed.. Big Al exposed... Why?? It added nothing!I really loved this movie, but wish I had gone alone. Don't make my mistake. It is sad that the makers of South Park didn't even try for a film that would have gotten a PG-13 rating. Their core audience (teens) will feel betrayed and parents will be pestered into taking their kids to see a movie that will cause the parents to squirm in their seats and hope that last sex joke went over their youngster's head.. while laughing so hard that tears flow down their faces.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"So Outrageous, It's Hilarious","While I've never gotten addicted to ""South Park,"" I have watched lots of episodes and get a real kick out of it. As it is with the movie, the kids are simply moving through an existence that has been created by their short sighted and bigoted parents. When they swear, it's so natural that it almost has a poetic rhythm. If one of them feels his feeling are hurt (especially Cartman), he retaliates with a blast of profanity. In some cases, as with the ""C"" word, the characters don't even know what they are dealing with. They take advice as genuine and go from there. No one gets left out when it comes to a lambasting. The parents are the real nut cases. The kids are trying to find a way to get their heroes, the Canadian comedy team, off of death row where the parents and the military have put them for misleading their youth. Who's doing the misleading?The subplot in Hell with Satan and Saddam Hussein is amazing. Satan is a really sensitive, introspective fellow, while Saddam is the nut case maniac. This, of course, is pre 9/11. In addition to the clever animation and voices, there are some great songs. ""Blame Canada"" is great and ""What Would Brian Boitano Do?"" is so over the top, it makes me giggle. Why did they pick this person as the object of the song other than for us to ask this question. I know this movie isn't for everyone (maybe most people), but if you can stand the assault, it's about as clever as anything can be.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Possibly the best of the summer '99 movies,"South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut was a surprisingly good movie.  I am a fan of the show, and catch it whenever I remember to, but I think I might have to be tuning into Comedy Central for South Park every single week now after seeing the movie.  The only painful parts of the movie for me were much of the anti-Canadian material, although not all (I joked about Canada when I was eleven... it gets old very quickly) and everything having to do with Sadam Hussein.  Otherwise, this movie was a laugh riot.  When I thought the movie was starting to go downhill, they introduced The Mole, one character who had me laughing with every word he spoke.  Please, see this movie... it'll make you laugh, and possibly even think of how you're raising your kids, or how we're all raising America.

The state of humor today,"""South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut"" shows the stars of TV's ""South Park"" (duh) Stan Marsh, Kyle Brofloski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick attempting to do many important if unusual things, such as averting war with Canada and stopping Satan from taking over the world. Along the way, Kenny dies, Cartman curses, Stan vomits on the girl he likes, and Kyle curses at Cartman. So... it's essentially everything they do in the show, only stretched out into a full length movie. Hooray.I can handle the show ""South Park"" in small doses. Some episodes I find extremely funny and also rather poignant as the creators point out what's wrong in society. However, it can rapidly become tiresome. At the end, that's exactly what this movie has become. It starts out fresh and interesting, but quickly dies during the scene where the boys watch the Terrence and Phillip movie.Pardon me if I go off on a slight tangent here, but it seems to me that this movie is indicative of the steady decline of the intellectual decline of humor from clever usage of language and satirical swipes made at society to cursing and bodily function jokes. People, please. Grow up. There is nothing inherently funny about somebody cursing. If used correctly and something to occasionally shock the audience, I have no problem with cursing. This movie throws foul language around as if it were rice at a weddings. It loses all ability to shock and simply becomes irritating. ""Oh. He just cursed again. Ha ha. And again. Ha ha."" This film tries to be satirical in what it pokes fun at, but it crosses the line between satire and parody far too often. Eventually, it crosses the line to paradoy and decides to stay there, but it's too late. Too little of either and too much of immature dreck.Don't tar me with that ""too old to understand South Park"" brush. I'm 18 now and saw the movie when I was 13, when I was still laughing at Cheech and Chong films. I got it then and I didn't like it. Same goes for today. So, I give ""South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut"" a two out of ten and a punch in the nose for helping to screw up humor. Screw this film, I'm going home.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
South Park one of the most Clever movies of the summer!,"It's not very often that you leave a movie with a sense of being overwhelmed by what just transpired on the screen.  It's even less often that this amazement stems from an animated feature.  South Park does all of this. With South Park's stabs on every facet of American Society from violence in the movies to Jar Jar Binks, South park hits a home run with anyone who is into a clever plot, funny musical score and great movie spoofs.

"Clever, Funny and Scathing: A Perfect Big Screen Transition for TV's Best Potty-Mouthed Kids","Premiering in 1997, 'South Park' arrived and shocked everyone, and, ultimately, changed the animated landscape the most since 'The Simpsons'. The series was a hit for Comedy Central and its owner Paramount, and so, only a few years after it began a feature film was commissioned in a bid to capitalise off of the series' popularity. So, in 1999, 'South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut' released.The plot follows the characters from the series, as 8 year olds Stan, Kyle, Cartman and the immortal Kenny (whom, in the series, constantly dies in, at that point, every episode), as they deiced to go an see the R rated feature debut of their favourite TV show from Canada, Terrance and Phillip, however, the film's use of strong language 'corrupts' the kids who begin to swear all the time, so, this forces the overprotective parents of the town of South Park to take action.....and put the blame purely on somewhere else and choose.... Canada.I think anyone who knows even the slightest thing about 'South Park' can see the parallels between the show and the fictional show Terrance and Phillip, as, when 'South Park' premiered it was meet with shock, disgust and outrage from parents. The film's plot is severely meta, using Terrance and Phillip as a placeholder for the series, these elements of hyper-focussed satire, which make up around the first 40 minutes, are easily the film's strongest plot, it also ties nicely into the film other major focus: the importance of free speech, which, is also dealt with well.The writing is top-notch, filled to the brim with satirical jibs and just plain silly jokes ('son, we've accidentally replaced your heart with a baked potato'), the story works very well in providing stakes and social commentary which is 'South Park's' best trait, though the series' brand of taking an issue and taking it to a comedic extreme does slightly mess with the pacing, though it doesn't undercut the experience greatly.Another thing I wanted to mention was the film's use of profanity, which is so fantastically creative, every utterance feels useful to elevate the film's themes.I feel like the film's biggest issue is that, just like the show, to deplore its issue of free speech, sets out to be offensive, which, in some cases in the show can work either extraordinarily well or poorly, sometimes its use of offence can be skilfully placed within its story to further its satirical point, or it can just feel lazy, this film to me feels like a bit both: there are several crudely clever gags and quite few just plain crude ones, which don't appeal as much to me as the smarter ones. Thankfully though, the film does manage to avoid this, mostly, despite a few instances.Another one of the film's biggest strength is its music, the film is a full blown musical, and they are pretty fantastic, 'It's Easy, M'kay' and 'Blame Canada' are my personal favourites, the songs are so good that 'Blame Canada' managed to snag an original song Oscar nomination. The characters are all pretty great too, the managed to translate their small screen personality to the big screen, while staying true to who the characters are established to be while adding a bit more cinematic depth to them. I also personally really like the animation, it looks intentionally cheap, but I feel like it has a deceptive level of polish and talent to it, plus, I feel like having it look like an old cardboard stop motion TV special, contrasts the crudeness of the film and series.Ultimately, for me, 'South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut', is a really great watch for me, as it is filled with great songs and sparkles with intelligent irreverence, but at points it can feel bogged down with its desire to offend, but, I think if you're a 'South Park' or not, it's definitely worth a watch, and is definitely one of the greatest comedies to grace the big screen: It's pretty much perfect, m'kay.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"South Park: Vulgar, Too Long and Should Have Been Cut","I do not understand the praise that ""South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut"" is receiving.  Yeah, it has its funny moments.  Yes, it pushes the envelope. True, it is daring.  But after the first half hour I was screaming, ""Enough is Enough!""The film is clever in its set-up.  Kyle, Stan, Cartman and Kenny see a rated-R film starring the Canadian gross-out team of Terrence and Phillip. The boys pick up some foul language that shocks their classmates, teachers and parents.  The adults blame Canada and a war ensues.There is, quite surprisingly, a message beneath the film's prurient exterior: If more parents paid attention to their kids instead of blaming the media for society's problems, we would all be better off.  I say, of course parents should pay attention to their kids.  But when are the media going to start taking some responsibility for the content that they provide? I support freedom of speech.  I know that the First Amendment wasn't created to protect nice speech.  But I also believe that we need to be responsible for the things we say and the messages we express.  The media should be accepting some responsibility for society's problems along with the parents.""South Park"" says a lot of mean things.  It is mean-spirited. Politically-incorrect humor can be funny (see ""There's Something About Mary""), but the movie's constant jabbing at gays and African Americans grew tiresome.  Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone keep the vulgarities coming...and coming and coming.  They knew they could get away with more on the big screen than the television screen, and the constant foul-language and obscene visuals eventually became boring.Note to parents: No children -- please!

You probably won't see it because you'll be laughing your damn fool head off the whole time.Trey Parker and Matt Stone, like me, were Denver-suburban kids of the 80s who grew up bitter, sarcastic, and addicted to humor in any form whatsoever. ""South Park"", the show, has has so many brilliant moments that it's easy to overlook how amazing the things they say and do really are.Also, like me, they hate the Baldwin family, Bill Gates, the military, censorship, and school counsellors; like me, they like Nick Rhodes enough to have him do a line (which doesn't sound like Nick at all -- he's the Canadian bomber pilot who... I won't spoil it).  I have to see the movie again just to hear the lines I missed because I and the rest of the audience were laughing too loud.  It's as densely packed as an 18-minute TV episode, and if you blink, you'll miss something else hilarious.One more thing: they realized that all animated films, i.e. ""Beavis and Butthead Do America"", have to have a White Zombie trip-out hell sequence.

An R-rated film about R-rated films,"The theme I caught from South Park:  Bigger, Longer, and Uncut (and there are many) is that our government is constantly missing the big picture.

You can never enjoy a dirty movie with your parents around.This is one of the most well-done movies I have seen in a long time, because it more than lives up to its expectations.  If you expect just the TV show with more cuss words, you are in for a big surprise.  This is NOT just another day in the ""Quiet peaceful redneck mountain town.""  The laughs are plenty, and some of the songs, ""Up There"" by Satan for example, are actually pretty good, not just funny.  Another issue the filmmakers address is the racist issue.  The general, who has probably lived under a rock the past 130 years, sends black troops, among them Chef, into the front lines of war in ""Operation Human Shield.""  How Chef and his men deal with it literally had the audience cheering.Speaking of audiences, if you plan to leave the theater in the middle of the film in disgust, PLEASE DO NOT MAKE IT A POINT TO SIT IN THE FRONT ROW SOME OF US ARE TRYING TO WATCH THE MOVIE.

A stroke of ironic genius.,"Trey Parker and Matt Stone created a monster in 1997 with the release of ""South Park"". Very few films based on TV shows are as good as the show (Beavis and Butt-Head do America comes to mind), but ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut"" really is a great movie. And believe it or not parents, this movie has a message! It says that nobody notices violence and perversion, but profanity is just a disgrace. As George Carlin says, ""No bad words. Bad thoughts, bad intentions, and words."" The words don't matter. It's the motivation behind them. When Cartman says ""What's the big f**kin' deal, bitch?"" He's basically addressing my exact thoughts. Why do parents care if their kids say the f-word? I bet a lot of the kids who are ""protected"" from this movie will end up in an asylum if not a state prison. This truly was ironic genius, because they get their message out, and they keep their gimmicks (i.e. ""Oh my God! They killed Kenny!) intact. Sheer genius.

Pushing the limits - Big-screen style.,"Trey Parker and Matt Stone really pushed the limits on television with the introduction of their TV series of the same name.  ""South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut"" heightens these limits to big-screen proportions, and fulfills the title quite nicely.The form that Parker and Stone take to bastardize society and then show it on the screen in this manner is purely hilarious.  I laughed far more than I thought I would.  Their perverse, harsh, and tasteless humor shines through, and on a larger scale.  The songs and dances are equally entertaining and just as offending as they are humorous.You need to like South Park, and its offensiveness to enjoy this movie... which I do.I rate this movie 8 out of 10.

Everything you expect - but without the bleeps.,"Matt and Trey were smarter with South Park. They made their film version when the show still had a lot of momentum, they also had an opportunity to be a little different in the cinema as even though Stan, Kyle Cartman and muffled Kenny were filthy little buggers they couldn't get away with most of the swears that these little 8 year old wanted to say. In the movies? No f*ckin' worries.The average South Park episode is better than the average Simpsons episode - has been for about 6 or 7 years. The problem is that when both at their very best The Simpsons is clearly head and shoulders above, only The Simpsons haven't been at their best since the mid 90s. For those in their 20s this means there is a real chance that you swear black and blue that Family Guy and South Park kick The Simpson's yellow arses.Only at this time I am comparing the movies and letting them battle it out for 80 minute supremacy honours, not which show was better over the decades.The South Park movie takes all the best SP bits, ludicrous premises, sheer genius stupidity, quality musical bits and smart and insightful messages delivered in a profane way by crude cardboard cutouts. Only South Park could take all this sh*t and have it even vaguely make sense.They also pull the p*ss out of a lot of celebrities (not always the easy targets too) and have the best ""post-scene"" throw in jokes of any animated show, sometimes the joke has gone and you're wondering if you just heard what you think you did.This is a seriously short movie but it manages to cram an awful lot in.(Assuming you know) the boys are going to see the new Terrance and Phillip movie, the romantic comedy (probably) ""Asses of Fire"". Inspired by the flatulent antics and potty talk they head back to home and school and tell everyone all about it, in no uncertain terms.After a brief brainwash where the profane tendencies are exorcised from their little cardboard bodies they promptly head back to the cinema for another look, afterwards Kenny is inspired by one of the stupid acts and accidentally lights himself on fire. As you can't live with a baked potato in place of your heart the operation to save Kenny fails and he is sent to hell.Everyone else is grounded, and Cartman gets a chip implanted in his head that emits and electrical shock if he swears.Due to their role in the death Terrance and Phillip are arrested due to the shrill barkings of Kyle's Mum and many other do-gooders, America goes to war on Canada (where T&P are from) after the Baldwins are bombed and T&P are scheduled for a very public execution during a big army show emceed by Big Gay Al.{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{} Meanwhile in Hell Kenny meets Satan, who is shacked up with the recently killed Saddam Hussein (who wasn't actually dead when the film was made), they announce that the spilling of innocent Canadian blood will allow Satan's rise to Earth, where he can turn it into another level of Hell. Nice.Kenny's ghost comes back to warn the boys, who in a moment of clarity realise they must stop the execution. Fortunately the war, Satan's rise and the big show where Terrance and Phillip are to be killed all happen in South Park. Lucky! There are a myriad sub-plots and everything wraps up nice and neat, there aren't really many high points but some of the many songs are extremely good, especially ""Uncle F*cker"" and ""Kyle's Mum is a bitch"". (What did you expect?) Kenny finally took his hood off which I remember was a big deal apparently at the time, and the boys got to unleash every version and arrangement of the f-word ever thought of.Final Rating – 8 / 10. Like South Park the TV show over the years. Consistent, full of laughs and good jokes with unlikely situations that somehow make sense. Just lacking that spark of inspiration to push it to greatness.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Social Commentary...and hilarious.,"Could be because I'm a die hard South Park Fan. Could be because my Spanish teacher was in it. Could be a love for my home-town heroes...but I don't think so. This movie had me laughing non-stop from beginning to end. I have to go back and see it again because I missed half the jokes due to the uproarious laughter of the jam packed theatre.  The jokes, of course, were vulgar, rude, and tasteless. However, if you can look past this you will find a strikingly cutting edge commentary on our society.  Matt Stone and Trey Parker are, in my opinion, two of the most fearless filmmakers of today.  They aren't afraid to offend people and are obviously opposed to the ridiculous extent that ""political correctness"" has reached.  I applaud my two home-town heroes for being fearless and funny and hope they will continue for a long time to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Why ""R"" Stands for ""Restricted""","First off, I want to re-iterate what many people have already been saying, since I don't think it can be beat into the ground enough:Attention Parents, Guardians, And Responsible Adults: DO NOT TAKE KIDS TO THIS MOVIE! I mean it. I'm not being prudish or censoring, I'm just warning you of dire consequences.  There are phrases in this movie even I've never heard, and I thought I had heard them all.I don't need to tell you the plot, or how funny it was, because a hundred reviews have already said as much.  I remember what it was like to be a child, and I know that this movie, if they see it, will affect them permanently.Having said that, I think it's also fair to note that this movie, in addition to being Adults Only, should have a minimum intelligence requirement, for two reasons.  First of all, if you're not smart enough, you won't ""get"" the point of the movie.  You'll only perceive it as a politically incorrect trashfest (which, in all fairness, it is) and nothing more.  However, allow yourself the nerves of steel to get past the blue humor (or perhaps embrace it, if you dare), and pick up on the theme: parents are responsible for their children, not the rest of the world. There are worse things out there than ""South Park"" (probably), and it's up to parents-- ah, forget it.There's the other group of people who will enjoy this simply for its shock value.  They, too, are missing the point, though only slightly.  Sure, vulgarity supposedly saves the day in the movie (I won't say how), but IT'S A JOKE.  They're not trying to promote the ""F"" word (right?...), they're just trying to get people to see how trivial language can--Okay, no more tangents.  Bottom line: this is the best movie I've ever seen that I wouldn't recommend to just anyone.  It requires a certain maturity level and/or world view to fully appreciate, one that many people don't have.  Okay, sermon's over.P.S.

Best Movie of 1999,"I've been thinking about the best-of-1999 list, and now the Oscars, and I have to say that I just can't avoid the conclusion that the best film of 1999 wasSouth Park.It's every bit as original and surreal as Being John Malkovich, while managing to do what it wants to more successfully.  It is simply a brilliant parody of the classical musical, with examples of songs ranging from the typical Disney animated spectacle to musicals such as Oklahoma.It also precedes Malkovich in its self-inversion - the response to the movie-within-a-movie documents the filmmaker's prediction  of the public response to South Park. Of course, it was simply perfect that the MPAA gave the film an NC17 rating (later changed to an R). What more could Trey Parker, the director, have asked for?I loved the Matrix, but while that film was the most visually exciting of the year, its plot borrowed from about ten different science fiction authors - it's a very good movie, but perhaps not the most original.Run Lola Run deserves a mention, but is smaller in its program.American Beauty has been done; The Insider is well made, but not great; Three KIngs is original and interesting and well-made... okay, it should be in the top five.  Haven't seen Toy Story 2 yet, or the Ripley film...Anyway, back to South Park...  The Bitch song, and video, deserves to go down in history as one of the best movie musical songs ever.And Skeet Ullrich's picture above Satan's bed by itself deserves an Oscar for best Production Design.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pushing the envelope?,"Hardly!  Trey Parker and Matt Stone have shredded the proverbial envelope with the release of ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut.""  The film is raunchy, obscenity-laden, and DEFINITELY NOT FOR KIDS.  It's also a side-splitting piece of fine work from the stars of ""BASEketball,"" who are also responsible for ""Orgazmo,"" and ""Cannibal: The Musical.""Contrary to early rumors about what the film was about, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman do NOT get whisked off to military school.  They do find themselves in the middle of a militaristic crisis started and fueled by Kyle's mom, after the boys sneak into a screening of the latest film by their favorite flatulent Canadian duo, Terrance and Phillip.  Practically no one is spared in this movie, as far as satire is concerned, and you'll be rolling in the aisles if you can recognize the parallels that Parker and Stone draw between life and art.  Despite the cursing, fart jokes, and Broadway-style musical numbers, the film is truly a serious look at the seemingly downward spiral of American society.I've been a fan of the ""South Park"" TV show, though I have yet to see some of the later episodes.  I waited for this movie with bated breath, and it exceeded my expectations.  ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut"" is ""South Park"" in its purest form; everything that Trey Parker and Matt Stone originally intended it to be.A final commentary: ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut"" deserved an NC-17 much, much more than ""Orgazmo,"" which did actually get an NC-17.  It's disturbing that children as young as 7 have been in attendance at ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut,"" even accompanied by an adult.  I'd like to see parents try to explain away some of the raunchier bits, like Saddam Hussein's, ahem, artificial prostheses, and the giant, er, pink bit, that Stan encounters.  But I suppose that's one of the points that Parker and Stone are trying to make...",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Extended TV show with added music,"That sums it up pretty well, but what it doesn't express is that South Park actually manages to sustain the laughter over the length of an entire movie, something most TV-to-film adaptations fail. And although its critics will point to the incredible amount of swearing and other questionable situations the movie involves, what they miss is that this is actually far more intelligent than most movies aimed at the teen audience. After all, what better way to frame a satire on censorship than in a film completely packed with bad-taste moments?South Park also marks a return to the musical genre of Trey Parker and Matt Stone's other brilliant movie, Cannibal! The Musical. The songs are actually very well made (I think one of them has a musical background) and anything that spoofs the awful, staid songs of traditional musicals is in my good books. If you're a fan of the TV show you've probably already seen this; if you're not, then I'd suggest ignoring all the negative publicity and giving it a go.

Be prepared to be shocked...,"Even though you watch South Park every week, own the tapes, etc. none of this can prepare you for what you will see on the big screen.

I know I missed some of the jokes & obscenities because I was laughing so hard.I was especially impressed by the special effects like the various scenes involving fire and flames.  The fire seemed real...almost three dimensional amongst the other plain 2-D objects on the screen.  Also, the demons from hell were really wicked looking.Hopefully, the VHS version is not far away.

"Hilarious, thought provoking and touching","South Park The Movie is, of course, a movie about the reaction to movies like South Park The Movie.  Terrance and Phillip The Movie - the fictional piece that drives the plot is, like South Park, designed for adults but with attractions for children, as all things adult are.  When our heroes are ""corrupted"" by the film, the film becomes the source of all of societies ills and the battle to destroy it and everything related to it escalates to full scale warfare.Along the way, the unabashed language actually hits several major funny bones once you get over the shock.  Like the boys, you enjoy mastering the shock and using the language to shock others, then blaming the movie for your behaviour.  The broad satire of a manipulative Saddam Hussein, pursuing his own agenda, could actually make you bust a gut laughing.But it was the empathy which you feel for the characters that actually made this movie special.  Your sympathies are for the characters with real problems like poor little Kenny (punished severely for missing church), Satan (in a disfunctional relationship), and Chef (once again being treated to a large helping of casual racism).  The characters who think they have a problem, like Kyle's crusading mother, get less sympathetic as the film goes on and their concern about the well being of their children grows. However, all's well that ends well, and everyone (well, almost everyone) winds up being redeemed, even good old Satan.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Over the top profanity, but the message rings true.","I knew South Park was going to have a lot of profanity in it even before I sat down to watch it, but it was simply amazing to hear how they managed to cram the ""F-word"" into just one five minute segment.  Sure, the word and many, many others are found all throughout the rest of the film, but it's done in such a blatantly gleeful manner, that you can almost see Trey Parker and Matt Stone sitting back and laughing at the Motion Picture Association. So is the movie just about how far they can push the profanity barrier? No. It's actually entertaining as a musical, and has a message that, with the way things are happening in the news today, couldn't have come along at a better time.  Four potty-mouthed kids actually make a strong, sensible point.  Who knew?As for the rest of the movie, everything that could have a boundary to be crossed, from racism to homosexuality, is completely trampled on, making nothing safe or untouched.  This movie is very much an equal-opportunity offender.  The movie spoofs everything from Star Wars, anime, Tommy, and the Hunchback of Notre Dame, and the songs, although bizarre, are actually quite good.  My only complaint about the music is that Chef didn't have his own musical number.The movie also reveals some of the great South Park mysteries such as ""What does Kenny look like under his hood"", and everyone cameos at some point or another.  The animation ranges from what you would find on the show to ""dramatic"" cinematic camera angles.Overall, South Park is an enjoyable film, but is definitely rated ""R"" for a reason.  I'm sure there will be a lot of groups saying that this movie is exactly why there are so many problems with society, but these are the same people who will never watch the film, and see that the film is poking fun at itself.

A PLEASANT (AND ACTUALLY FUNNY) SUPRISE FOR ALL TO SEE,"What a pleasant suprise indeed! In fact this movie is on my list as the funniest, if not best film, of 1999 (along with Jim Owl Hosney). The show for me is not very funny and is has only one attack, to curse the bejezus out of you. But this film had it all: laughs, satire, hilarious musical numbers (my favorite being Satan's ""Up There"" that mimicked perfectly Disney's pointless, uninspired songs, namely Feifel's little ditty ""Somewhere Out There""). This pic had more though, my favorites: 1. Satan is the most sensitive character in the film 2. How the parents are so stupid that they cause 150 times more violence and carnage than the Terrence and Phillip show could have inspired 3. The reality that Americans view Canadians as deviant Hosers 4. The hypocrisy in people and the media. When Cartman says something along the line of ""don't call me fat, you f@#^ing Jew!"" and the teacher says ""Did you use the f-word?!"", totally missing the point that racism is more lethal than a silly cuss word.

American Ugly,"SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT (1999)-- Grade: A-The year of 1999 was, for me, a hell of a year for cinema, especially the American cinema. Stanley Kubrick died, but he left his last jewel EYES WIDE SHUT. We came to knew new talents as Spike Jonze (BEING JOHN MALKOVICH) and to have a strong proof of others' abilities- Paul Thomas Anderson with 1999's best, MAGNOLIA. That was also the year of BOYS DON'T CRY, THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY, ELECTION, THE SIXTH SENSE, THE INSIDER, THE MATRIX, THE CIDER HOUSE RULES, ARLINGTON ROAD, MAN ON THE MOON, CRUEL INTENTIONS, GO, FIGHT CLUB... But the one that is most likely to stay as a classic is AMERICAN BEAUTY. Even not being the year's best (MAGNOLIA is even better), it won 5 Oscar. And it touched us and made us laugh with an original and dark satire of the stupid and unbearable American way of life. AMERICAN BEAUTY was a semi-commercial, semi-artistic picture, or maybe not one nor the other, that used symbolism and mise-en-scene to tell its story and criticize the American family, also talking about the beauty that we can see even in a plastic bag. If that criticism was deep and bittersweet, the one that is in SOUTH PARK- BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT is very different. Not just the American society is criticized, but also the militarism, the racism, the movie ratings, the patriotism, Brooke Shields, Saddam Hussein, the Baldwin brothers, Winona Ryder... Everything and everyone you imagine... And much more.I started watching the animated series some years ago, but I was never a die-hard fan. But when I watched it I had a great time. When the movie was released in the US I was looking forward to see it, but the Brazilian distributors committed a mistake and the movie was released here only in August 2000. But the wait was worthy. SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT is the most offensive movie I've ever seen and also one of the funniest. I couldn't stop laughing a minute. There was more and more and more absurds and wicked situations to laugh at. But the good thing is that all those offensive things have a point. Trey Parker and Matt Stone criticize everything, but in fact they just want to show the American hypocrisy, using all the kinds of over-the-top situations. Of course the criticism is not so mature and strong as in FIGHT CLUB, but Parker and Stone just want to make us have fun with that, while David Fincher has a very different point- with no links to make audiences have fun.The story starts when the four boys go to the movies to watch a R-rated movie starring Terrance and Philip, two Canadian comedians who use the sickest kind of humor. The boys start to use the words they heard on the movie and after some days all the school is using the words. Of course the mothers get very, very angry, so what they can do... Blame Canada, why not? They start a real war against the country ""above"", but the things get really nasty, involving even the Devil and Saddam Hussein as lovers. You can't even imagine what happens then... Kenny's death in the hospital room is one of the funniest parts, but this is a minor thing (there is the ""search for the clitoris"", a certain German porn video in the Internet and more). Of course everything is taken to the limit, but all is covered by an intelligent screenplay and much originality.The idea of using a musical structure is another smart thing. The Disney animations are musicals, but some of them (POCAHONTAS, yawn!) are so pathetic that they may harm children's minds. SOUTH PARK is not for children- don't even think that! The point is that the songs are more realistic and intelligent, even using an interminable number of F-words. (That song about the uncle is so sick!)SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT may be really hazardous, even fatal to the most delicate and conventional people, but if you are an open person and like to laugh of absurds, then this movie is for you. The funniest film of 1999 by far and one of the funniest ever made. But don't forget there is a point, that makes it... bittersweet.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Undoubtedly they will miss the point, but those of us who have always understood South Park is intelligent satire hidden in chubby cheeked children's pre-adolescent pranks, the message rings happily and funnily true.For a series which has already been made the most popular animated television show ever (eat your heart out Bart Simpson) and even been nominated for a GLAAD Award promoting acceptance and love towards homosexuals, this send-up of nearly every stereotype and ignorant ""hick mountain town"" attitude is a crowning achievement.

"Bit funny, though......","This really does feel like a movie that was born from a television show.  It feels dragged out and you spend too much of your time in this film waiting for something to happen.  The annoying thing is that when it does it is usually very funny (I say usually because there is only so many times you can laugh at the 'f' word) and you feel that the film could have been so much better.It is far too concerned in being controversial.  Trey and Matt seem like little boys with a new toy in their overuse of things that they couldn't get away with on regular T.V.  The prime example is the now unbleeped swearing. Also, they need a stronger plot for a film; it needs to last a lot longer than the T.V. show so the plot and characters need to progress.  Problem is that Trey and Matt are very good at being mildly funny but not at writing that vital plot.

Exquisite,"This film is one of the greatest animated films of all time (usually making most critic's top five lists, sometimes top ten) and one of the finest comedies too. It's funny, meaningful, and has a message that isn't too extreme for it's viewers although it may not be obvious to them. Parker and Stone are fine voice actors, but Mary Kay proves herself as one of the greatest of all time. She takes all of her characters and puts so much life into so much of them, she can make somebody funny with just her subtle voice, and has so much drive and emotion in each character. If Fellini's 8 1/2 was a look into the director's unique life this films one ups it by having the controversy, perception, and content of South Park at the time parodied. The series it's self was a field major in the culture wars of the 1990's against political correctness and censorship, this film serves as something of a climax to the war with a clear winner. It's impact is still felt in theatre and film today, it's message just as meaningful. Matt and Trey extend the analysis of their show (something rarely if ever done in film at this point) to new heights through the avatars of both Terrance and Phillip (who beautifully parody both the derp comedies of the day especially from Canada, and the false perception of the show it's self) and Stan and Kyle. Through this they give us a meaningful film that has a message that extends from their own lives into so much more and that's universal. The songs are A+ too and deserved the Oscar above Phil Collins. Great film.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The best comedy of the year...if you can take it!,"Going into this movie, I was expecting a few funny South Park songs, some typical banter between the quartet, and a political statement made at the end.  What the audience got (I went to the pre-screening at Paramount) was a carefully orchestrated musical with songs using musical cliches to a hilarious result. Trey and the gang went all out with explicitness as many stunts in the movie were shameless and explicit.  But that is what made it so great!  This movie is going to do very well, and no doubt the soundtrack will be a big seller.The swearing never stops and neither does the sexual innuendoes...rather, they aren't innuendoes at all...it is all explicit.  This movie definitely merits an ""R"" rating, and is definitely too strong for the youngsters. This movie is perfect for the diehard high school and college students, and that was definitely the demographic at the pre-screening.People who ""don't get"" South Park (mainly critics and parents) will despise this movie.  However, it easily tops Austin Powers for laughs, especially, as I said before, the musical numbers which are terrific.  So, for all the South Park faithful, get to the theaters on a day when it is crowded so that you enhance your experience with the synergetic frenzy.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Super,"South Park is the greatest television programme in history.  Forget The Simpsons, this is the show that dares to tackle the gritty subject matter, and the film is no different, trying to offend as many people as possible in under 90 mins.Some people find this show offensive, but they are missing the point entirely.  We laugh because it highlights the one-sided attitude of society, and how we are ready to mock anyone, but look down on anyone else who does it.There is stupid humour and the songs are just ace, the whole thing melds together into one great cartoon.So good in fact, that I wrote my A-level media studies coursework on it.Anyway, if you can't laugh at other people, what can you laugh at?  South Park is there to show us that a completely censored life would just be dull.My Rating: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Is South Park near Littleton?,"I don't trust people who ask questions like ""What's wrong with profanity?""  If there wasn't anything wrong with it, why the social proscriptions?  The truth is some of us know that it is; that restraint is the right road to take; and that movies like ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut"" promote the idea that the best approach to take is the shortest one between your brain and your mouth.  It doesn't matter how childish or stupid or hateful the thought is; it has a right to be heard--and considering ""South Park's"" popularity, a lot of people must feel this way, or else have never really thought about it seriously.Considering how many Emmies it won, I must be in the minority on not liking the TV series ""The Wonder Years,"" but I always felt like the writers were always putting words into the mouths of babes that sounded more eloquent and sage than they should.  I think Trey Parker and Matt Stone do the same thing. They revel in the nastiness they force out of the mouths of Kyle and Cartman and Stan.  They may feel that profanity doesn't hurt anyone, but isn't the point of profanity that it be offensive?  That it is trying to revolt someone?  Trying to sully someone or their reputation?  Trying to outrage Mom and society and convention?The dishonest part about this is, whether they care to admit it or not, Parker and Stone like holding up Kyle and Cartman and Stan as moral beings.  We are getting the same nonsense about their forthrightness as we did when people were praising Bart Simpson for his irreverence and cynicism.  Even I'm willing to accept a good dose of this stuff, if it clears the air.  But if I'm to believe that a lot of kids talk like the ones on South Park, then the moral methane that rises from the confusion that a Terrence and Phillip create must to God make the world look like Gary, Indiana.Unless we or grace or both are constantly in touch with our children, they remain pre-moral imps like Cartman or Kyle, congratulating themselves on what little triumphs over vice they manage to eke out every so often.  This moral underachievement may not be a bad thing; but it's hardly a great thing either.  And the praise this movie is getting stumps me.  Profanity may not be as bad as, say, mowing down your classmates with a semiautomatic weapon, but the distance between the two is not exactly reason to stand up and cheer either.  South Park is in Colorado, right?  Is it anywhere near Littleton?",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's HILARIOUS!,"This is, coming from one of the biggest Star Wars fans in the world, the greatest movie I have ever seen.  I know it's a bit blasphemous, but it's the truth.  One of the greatest things is that this movie, unlike others in recent times, doesn't pretend to be something it's not.  It's a low-down, raunchy, potty-mouthed, Barbra Streisand ripping on comedy, and it doesn't seek to inflate itself to anything more.  But DAMN, does it do what it's supposed to effectively.  From the opening song to the end credits, I laughed so hard I had trouble standing up at when it was over.  A good 4-star movie, and will probably beat out a certain other, not-near entertaining attempt at a movie that opened the same night.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Obscene, but with a heart","Not since Monty Python's Meaning of Life have I found a movie so completely offensive...and I found myself LOVING IT, for exactly the same reasons.

Giggling for so many other great moments, which you all should go see for yourselves.This is what happens when two like-minded punks are given a bunch of money to spend, and little or no editorial oversight.  God Bless em!POSTSCRIPT: I went to see the movie at 4pm on opening day...and was surprised to see how many adults brought their VERY young children. Either they knew and didn't care about the advance warnings of heaping platefuls of profanity, or they were unaware that the R rating meant that the normally bleeped dialog on the series would make it into the movie.

Simply put: The funniest movie I've seen in a long time.,"The last episode of South Park I saw I actually turned off halfway through. It was so bad, I wasn't laughing at anything. So I was a bit wary to see this movie. Then I saw good reviews everywhere, and figured I might as well check it out. And boy am I happy I did! South Park is probably one of the funniest movies to come out in 1999. You know the story, so there's no point on going over it. South Park's creators basically engage in a hilarious self-parody of everything that has happened to South Park and the protests that can be expected from the movie. I've heard more swearing in this movie than I have anywhere else in my life, I think. Some of it seems to just be thrown in for the shock value of hearing little kids saying four letter words, but much of it is pertinent to how kids talk, and very funny. The film also makes fun of the MPAA, among others, with the line, ""You can kill as many people as you want in your movie, but you can't use bad language!"" I recommend this movie to everyone on the planet with a sense of humor.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Watchable, but doesn't match the funny of the show...","When Stan (Trey Parker), Eric (Trey Parker), Kyle (Matt Stone) and Kenny (Matt Stone) go seen an R rated movie (that was made in Canada) they start cussing. When Kyle's mom (Mary Kay Bergman) hears him cussing she blames Canada. Soon, everyone starts blaming Canada and a war is started.I don't know why I didn't like this as much as the TV show. Maybe it's because I don't like Terrance and Phillip at all. Or maybe it's because loud ""bleeeeeeep""s are funnier than the actual words. I'm not sure.The music is wonderful. But the comedy just isn't there as much as the other shows. Cartman isn't as racist and rude, he just cusses a bunch.In fact, most of the comedy was replaced with cuss words and sex jokes that they could't say on TV.So, it's not for everybody, but most people seem to like it, so give it a go.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the funniest films of 1999.,"It seems as if everyone has had something to say about this movie, and given most of the comments I have read, I find myself wondering whether or not they actually watched it.  Though this movie is liberally laced with profanity, it is so outrageous and over-the-top, I cannot understand how anyone could consider it offensive.  In fact, I believe that if people looked beyond that and actually watched the movie, they would see what I saw: One of the funniest films of 1999.  This is a great movie.  In addition to some classic comedy, it has a great story, and a superb, Oscar-worthy soundtrack.

Anti-Political Correctness & super funny! 9/10,"If you're utterly annoyed by political correctness, then go and watch this cracker of a film! Superb script, hilarious dialogue and wonderful 'characters' - wonder if this cartoon would have been possible, if the animations had been better, and thus appealed to a wider audience? Anyway - they are just perfect for the purpose of this film!Being a European, I have certain preconceptions about the hypocritical side of the American society, experienced both through media and through my personal life, part of which has been in the States. This film is a refreshing and successful attempt to confront this dark aspect of the USA. It will NOT appeal to any puffed-up, pseudo-religious, narrow-minded person, who believes that any kind of swearing or nudity is more dangerous than shooting a human being! However, if you possess any kind of self-irony, then this just might be the best parody of a society made for the previous many years. It superbly exposes the inconsistency and stupidity that comes from any kind of racism, small-town red-neckism, and intolerance.I have only ever seen two episodes of South Park before - but I still love the film!

Great (but foul) example of the Broadway Musical style,"This movie made me laugh so hard Junior Mints came out my nose! Be warned, the language is extremely foul. You'll hear the F word to many times to count just in the first 7 minutes - but it's FUNNY! The basic plot is that the boys' favorite cartoon characters release a movie that is rated R (hmmm...). The boys sneak in to see it and return with potty mouths. The parents declare war on the root of the obscenity and the rest is history. This movie is a musical and shows absolutely brilliant orchestration and arrangement. One of the most amazing pieces of music is a medley of the different themes that reminds me of the end of the first act of Les Miserables (the broadway musical). There are also lots of guest voices including George Clooney and Nick Rhodes (of Duran Duran). If you like South Park you MUST see this. If you hate South Park, you'll hate this movie.

"Not my kind of Movie, but there is an audience for it.","South Park; Bigger, Longer and Uncut is classified as an animated comic, musical. Released in 1999.The stars of the show are nothing more than cut out paper figures made from colorful construction paper.South Park; Bigger, Longer and Uncut is about a group of third graders who bribe a homeless guy to buy their movie passes so that they can get into a foreign film called ""Asses of Fire"" starring two Canadians by the names of Terrance and Phillip. The film ""Asses of Fire"" has been rated ""R"" by the MPAA. This goes to show you that there are always ways of getting around the established rules in life. The movie is filled with obnoxious farting and swearing set to music so that it can also be considered a musical. As a result of the children seeing the movie, which they consider totally awesome, they themselves immediately begin mimicking what they have just seen by incorporating the foul language into most every conversation from that moment on. Of course they go to school using their new found persona and the parents are notified immediately. Kenny sets himself on fire by trying to light a fart as a result he dies, of course.The reactions of the parents bring on an all out world war. The parents accomplish this by putting all of the blame on Canada because that is where Terrance and Phillip are from. The President of the United States declares war. Canadians become enemies to everyone accept of course Eric Cartman(Trey Parker), Stan Marsh(Trey Parker) and Kyle Brosloski and Kenny McCormick(Matt Stone), who must now save the world.Satan is portrayed as a gay wimp that is involved with Saddam Hussein. Because this film was made in 1999, Hussein was still alive then, who knew just how ironic that would end up. Satan and his bed partner decide that the war up top has given them the edge to take over the world.There is a lot being said that is of a political nature by the writers underneath the mask of these characters. Even though watching this type of film was very disturbing to me, I realized that there were some issues embedded throughout the film that deserve mention: There are religious fanatics that want to put the blame on someone and punish them for everything in the world that goes wrong. In the process they themselves afflict pain onto others which is supposed to be God's job.The issue of censorship, if people do not want to watch something they have a choice not to. They do not have the right to tell others what to choose. And even if children are underage, if they really want to do something they will find a way to do it. Children usually mimic what they see, especially by their parents.Prejudice against any group of individuals, this film is riddled with the irony of prejudice. The very mother waging war had an adopted child that is a Canadian. This type of film reminds me of Beavis and Butthead which is another show that I have never watched in its entirety because I couldn't get past the content.The use of colorful construction paper has merit for visual appeal and because of it lighting was not really an issue. There wasn't any special lighting needed. There are plenty of musical ditties throughout and you really expect it with every changing of scenes, however it never really signified a dramatic change in mood.The content of South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut includes an extreme amount of obscenities, violence, nudity, sexual innuendos of which should shock anyone. I think the writers are trying to make several statements about the world as it appears to them and at the same time make it entertaining on a bazaar platform. This is not my kind of entertainment, but everyone has their own preferences.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the Funniest Movies of All Time,"There was never a dull moment in this flick. I laughed, and laughed, and laughed. Matt and Trey did an outstanding job in making the most vulgar movie of all times.

"Quick, in-your-face fun","I'm not a long-time viewer of South Park(those that are... keep your eyes open for in-jokes), but I have taken in a reasonable bit of it. This plays not unlike three episodes of the show, and pretty darn good ones at that. The plot is great, and develops well throughout the entirety of the running time. The writing is almost invariably funny, and a considerable amount is undeniably satirical and smart, to an impressive extent. The self-irony and -referencing raises this above similar releases. This definitely has a lot of offensive material(my personal theory is that Matt and Trey grew up not being allowed to look at, say, and so on, such, and now that they're old enough to call the shots for themselves, they're getting even), and some of it certainly is there for the purpose of outraging those who have little tolerance for such. But for anyone who enjoys the humor that we connect to the series, this is rather likely to have you laughing for most of the 81 minutes. The pacing is fast, without being overwhelming. The songs are quite catchy and well-written. The acting is marvelous, and the guest voices are cool. The animation is the same stubbornly poor kind as we're used to from something with this title, but there are some nice extra stuff thrown in, and the various actual effects are, in fact, magnificent. It would be a shame if someone didn't see past the crude comedy and thusly did not realize that Parker and Stone do have stuff to say(although it is arguably in part their own doing, obviously). There is heavy violence, moderate sexuality and almost constant language herein. If you can tolerate, perhaps even enjoy, musicals and the content that censors frown upon, consider giving this a shot. I recommend this to, in addition to aforementioned, fans of Matt Stone and Trey Parker and their other works. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

The kids get hooked on the movie and they start saying all the dirty language they picked up from the movie. Then they even use it at school. So the other classmates things the kids are cool for seeing the Terrance and Philip movie, so eventually they do it too.

The Kenny Going to Hell animation is really cool, where totally flatly animated Kenny is in 3-D Hell(done with computer animation).

Now this is what real comedy is all about!,"I give ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut"" a solid 10 stars. This movie and the show which it is based on, though crudely animated, is truly what comedy is supposed to be: intelligent, gutsy, vulgar, profane, offensive, and never, ever, ever selling out. I believe authentic humor comes when you shouldn't have to walk on a tightrope with censorship. I further believe, and I hate to admit it, that authentic humor comes when you shouldn't really care less about whether or not the things you say is going to offend or disgust a certain group or a certain individual. After all we do have a constitution.When I compare ""South Park"" with another prime-time animated series like the long-running 20th Century Fox's ""The Simpsons"" or compare the South Park movie with Trey and Matt's 1998 movie, Universal's ""BASEketball"", both the show and the movie ""South Park"" brutally squashes the competition every time. Bart Simpson, for all of his far superior animation, his troublemaking, his ""don't have a cow, man!"" doesn't begin to hold a candle that of Eric Cartman or other such ruthlessly funny characters like Terrence & Phillip, The Mole, Satan, or Saddam Hussein.

"sweeter than it is lame, but not groundbreaking","It was a slightly surprising development when the makers of South Park took their excellent homoerotic cartoon show to the big screen after just a couple of TV series, but it's easy to see why - the massive cult audience of the show guaranteed instant interest and profits.But with 'Bigger, Longer and Uncut' they didn't quite make the most of it. They had already toyed with 2-parter episodes on TV, and given that this isn't much more than an hour in length, one has to ask what it is that justifies turning this particular storyline as a film.War, religion, T&P, angry parents, swearing, Canada, Satan and Saddam Hussein were all themes and concepts which had already been exploited in the TV series. The film brought nothing new to the audience, apart from losing the beeps on swearwords, more expensive cgi effects and slightly bigger musical numbers.Very little new ground was broken, and I think many of the season 2/3 TV shows from the same era are actually better than the feature film. Sorry Matt and Trey, I love your work, but admit it, this was a bit of cash-in.That said, if you like South Park it's well worth watching, just don't expect it to be radically different.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"South Park - Bigger, Longer and Uncut","The movie is good comedy and it has very much swearing, especially Terrance and Phillip are great idea for the movie. When i first saw the movie i laughed to it very much, haahah the unclefucka-song is very good. The movie starts when Stan,Kenny,Kyle and Cartman wants to go to see the Asses of fire movie, and then they cant go in but they pay to homeless guy so they can get in. The boys are swearing and they get busted for it. Then their parents hear that they saw R-rated movie, then begins war. USA versus Canada. If you've watched South Park from TV and liked it, then u may like the South Park - Bigger,Longer and Uncut movie!!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
