Merry Christmas Ya Filthy Animal!,"In the Eighties, John Hughes churned out a handful of movies and scored many, many hits. Quite rightly, as most of them were seriously funny - I'm DEFINITELY not referring to Curly Sue, so relax! In one particular scene from Uncle Buck, Macaulay Culkin interrogates a babysitter through the letterbox to make sure she's not a baddie. This inspired Hughes to write a whole new movie. Who would have known that this and its sequel would go on to become two of the biggest hits of all time? Both Hughes and Chris Columbus seem to prefer setting their movies during the holiday season (Gremlins, Planes, Trains & Automobiles, Christmas Vacation) and manage to pull them off without too much sentiment, or sickening amounts of gooey love.There are two reasons why Home Alone was such a big success. The first is that it's about a kid who outsmarts grown-ups, something that happens every day, only there's a worldwide conspiracy of silence. This movie yells it out loud and clear. The second is John Williams's magical score, which elevates the movie way above slapstick family fare to something more serious and regarded. It was nominated for an Academy Award, along with the Christmas carol Somewhere In My Memory, but lost to John Barry's Dances with Wolves. Damn! In a mad rush to the airport one morning, the MacCallister family forget one little thing...Kevin (Culkin). He is an eight-year-old kid who wants nothing better than a peaceful Christmas and some time to himself. It's hard for him to get this when living in a house with seven other people(the exact same house from Planes, Trains And Automobiles, don't you know0. With the rest of the MacCallisters in Paris, Kevin runs wild doing whatever he wants, eating whatever he wants and watching whatever TV show he wants.But there's one major problem. The Wet Bandits, Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern), are on the prowl and have knocked off every other house in Kevin's street. His is next. And seeing that he's man-of-the-house now, he HAS to defend it.Using whatever tools are at his disposal (rusty nails, blow torches, Micro Machines) he sets up a labyrinth of booby traps, so that the Wets can't break in. Their idiot-proof determination proves to be their downfall, as they are tortured and torn-up upon entering Kevin's domain.Although this is not the only point of the film, there is an important message that family is what really matters to a child, or to anyone, and having them home for the holidays is better than wandering a huge house all by yourself.There are some movies that work best at Christmas and this is one of them. I'm not saying that in a couple of decades it will be the new It's A Wonderful Life, but it will be remembered fondly at the very least.Don't be a Scrooge. It's Christmastime. Go rush to check out Home Alone.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Wonderful!,"I absolutely love the first two Home Alone movies, the third one is adequate but the fourth movie is just dreadful and makes me vomit because of what it did to two underrated gems and a little -below-average follow up. Macaulay Culkin is wonderful as Kevin. In this and Home Alone 2, which is my personal favourite, he is cute and self-assured. Alex D Linz gives a spirited performance in Home Alone 3, but Michael Weinburg just doesn't do anything with the script(which was terrible), other than whine in the fourth film. Anyway back to Home Alone. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern steal the film, with their goofiness and charm that was evidently missed in the last two instalments. Matching them, is the late great John Candy, and here he is wonderful. Candy has starred in movies like Uncle Buck and Planes, Trains and Automobiles, both of which are hilarious. Home Alone just broadens the comedic talent, that Candy certainly had. The film looks beautiful, with very good direction, and best of all great visual jokes and traps, as well as a fun and sometimes touching script. My problem is why is the rating for both Home Alone and Home 2 so low, when almost everyone I know consider them as holiday classics? All in all, a funny, touching and underrated film, that could have been a little shorter(only by one or two minutes). 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern as the Grinches Who Almost Steal Christmas...,"The overwhelming success of 'Home Alone' (it spawned two sequels), is enough to guarantee that most people will love this story of a family that departs for Paris on the Christmas holidays, mistakenly leaving an eight-year old boy to fend for himself. And fend he does, when burglars threaten to break in unless he can rig enough booby-traps to keep them out.That's the simple plot in a nutshell. Macaulay Culkin seems to have no problem carrying most of the film with a wide variety of looks, gestures and expressions--but for my money it's Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci who get the main laughs as the bumbling burglars intent on outwitting the kid's traps.Others in the cast don't have as much to do but do well enough by their roles, particularly Catherine O'Hara and John Heard as the parents who only discover on the plane that Kevin is missing. The laughs are steady, the color photography is great and the slight story is probably every boy's fantasy of what it might be like to be left home alone. Add to that the holiday flavor of Christmas and a pleasant musical score by John Williams and you have the makings of a classic.The proof is in the pudding--they must have done something right!!",,Anonymous,Comedy
Surreal and hilarious,"""Home Alone"" is one of the most popular movies from the early 90's. Its success was phenomenal and it also made Macaulay Culkin a superstar.The plot is quite original and surreal: a child who is home alone and capable of making the bandits's lives miserable? Sure, it's an impossible story, but who cares? Far from being a perfect movie, it is however okay and fun to watch, entertaining and contains slapstick humor too although I don't like some of the language used.Our story takes place in Chicago at Christmas time, which makes this a Christmas film. In fact, the movie has lots of Christmas decorations, lights, snow and many other details which create the feeling and magic so characteristic of Christmas. To accent the Christmas atmosphere even more, there are a cup of nice Christmas carols such as ""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree"" (performed by Brenda Lee), ""You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch"", ""White Christmas"", ""Carol of the Bells"", ""Oh Holly Night"" and ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" and some brilliant instrumental musics.Kevin McCallister is the hero of the story. He's not just any kid, he's a very smart one. He also knows all about the intentions of the ""wet bandits"" Harry and Marv and prepares them lots of unexpected ""surprises"". Their lives won't be easy with Kevin defending his house. Sure, they are the villains and as such they get what they deserve, but they do suffer a lot too. We almost feel sorry for them.The ""wet bandits"" were nicknamed like that by Marv because their ""calling card"" (according to him) was to let the water running in every houses they robbed. That said, both ""wet bandits"" are hilarious. Harry is more cranky, while Marv is the most stupid of the two (although both are stupid) and maybe that's why people tend to sympathize more with him. Marv's stupidity also makes him the funniest of the two. Marv is the typical tall and clumsy guy with no brain, a bit like Averell Dalton from the Lucky Luke comics.The movie has lots of funny moments. The funniest for me is when Harry and Marv pretend to be Santa Claus and his elf and the way Harry speaks in that scene, followed by the even funnier part when Kevin fires at Harry's pants. Whenever Kevin fools the bandits in a try to make them believe the whole family is at home when Kevin is all alone is funny too. For some reason, I also find funny whenever Kevin screams maniacally (particularly when he says he's not afraid anymore and sees Old Marley and screams out loud.The scenes which Kevin fools and scares the Little Nero's Pizza boy and Marv with the gangster film ""Angels with Filthy Souls"" are hilarious, but in the case of the Pizza boy it is unfair for him. There was no need to scare the hell out of him - he was just delivering pizza and wasn't after Kevin.Old Marley is an interesting character. I always felt sorry for him because of the lies Buzz tells about him. And the man never did anything bad to anyone. Buzz is a jerk and Uncle Frank is even worse. Buzz is mean for Kevin and Uncle Frank openly dislikes Kevin. When Uncle Frank tells Kevin «Look what you did, you little jerk!», Kevin's parents should tell him something like «Frank, stay out of this and shut up!».The church is magnificent. It's one of the biggest and most beautiful churches I've ever seen in a movie.Macaulay Culkin is terrific as the clever kid Kevin McCallister. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are awesome as the ""wet bandits"" and Roberts Blossom is great as the character Old Marley. It's also delightful to see John Candy as Gus Polinski, the «Polka King of the Midwest».",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Heartwarming Holiday family classic.,"'Home Alone' has succeeded in establishing itself as a Christmas tradition, spawning off three sequels (including a made-for-television flop), and a whole franchise in and of it.Macaulay Culkin plays Kevin McCallister, the average American child. He has an attitude almost expected of a Chris Columbus film from the eighties. He lives with a large family, which, right now, being around Christmas time, is about quadrupled, flooded by relatives' children, all of whom pick on poor, poor Kevin (sympathy long lost later into the film).One day Kevin wakes up from his sleep to find his wish has come true: his parents (John Heard and Catherine O'Hara) have disappeared. Enthralled by this, he proceeds to do everything and anything he was not allowed to do before, including eating ice cream in the morning, watching violent gangster films, jumping on the bed, wrecking his brother's room, and having some fun with a BB gun. Unfortunately for Kevin, his parents have not just disappeared - they have accidentally left him at home before going to Paris!Trouble really starts when two pesky burglars, Harry Lime (Joe Pesci) and Marv Merchants (Daniel Stern), decide that their next burglary will be at the McCallister residence. Little do they know Kevin is more than prepared, arming the house with an array of booby-traps that would impress top spies in the American government.John Hughes, writer/director/producer of my favorite comedy, 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles,' wrote this film, and it is no wonder. It is just like Hughes' humor. It mixes emotion, belly laughs and a warm-hearted ending all into one little bundle called a movie. John Hughes' films, in my experience, are usually very good, mainly because he approaches films at a very classic level. He doesn't resort to crude, kid jokes, like 'The Master of Disguise' or 'The Tuxedo,' to name a few recent flops. He almost always levels everything out perfectly in his scripts, and nothing is different here. Also, he places Kevin and co. in a large brick home in a large neighborhood in Chicago; a home that very much resembles those in 'Planes.' and 'Uncle Buck' (I would not be surprised if it is the same home).As for the acting.Macaulay Culkin is not at his best here. His best performance would have to be in an earlier John Hughes film named 'Uncle Buck,' where he had more of a cute charm than an acting charm. Here, he could barely act his way out of a plastic bag. Fortunately, with great performances by John Heard, Catherine O'Hara, Pesci and Stern, his bad acting is long forgotten by the time we become absorbed into the film.John Heard and Catherine O'Hara bring Kevin's parents to life. They seem almost complete opposites. Kevin's father, Peter (Heard), is very calm and laidback. His mother, Kate (O'Hara) is extremely nervous almost all the time, fretting throughout the film. She is aggravated very easily and, like all mothers, her instinctive nature to care for her child is what drives her to the point she goes to in the film.And then there's Pesci and Stern. My favorite lot of the film. They perfectly blend humor, pain and aggravation to the film.Pesci's character Harry is very strict, easily agitated and picks on Marv for a great many things. Marv, the stereotypical 'tall, stupid one,' is completely stupid. He does things that would make a hamster blush. Yet he is the character I have found many like the most, mainly because he is so stupid you have to feel sorry for him. Stern brings a great trait to the character of Marv, and I am very pleased he got the part. It's a hard choice to decide which baddie is better, so I just say I like them both the same.All in all, 'Home Alone' is probably the best Christmas movie to rise out of the film industry in the last twenty years. It seamlessly blends humor, pain, emotion, human instinct and some great booby-traps all into one little bundle. This film has stood the test of time greatly.4.5/5 stars -",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A well done family comedy,"This type of family comedy truthfully works better if you are grown up with the stooges.  Because this film has a climactic scene with more slapstick than most can take.  I can though.  But if you think this is strictly a kids film, parents will like it too I bet. The plot follows a kid (Macaulay Kulkin) who gets left behind in a Chicago suburb while his family leaves for Paris.  And though the house is all his, 2 burglars (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who give the best on-screen duo of 1990) want the house.  But not without the climax.  While most of the film is unbelievable (both good and bad), most of the film should keep families in good spirits, unless parents don't enjoy seeing Pesci getting his head on fire and Stern screaming like a girl.  Funny, even if it's not John Hughes' (writer/producer here) best.  B+",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The film made Macaulay Culkin a household name and the biggest child star since Shirley Temple.In this film a child get left behind on accident in his Chicago home while his family has flown off for Christmas.This film takes place in Chicago, the McCallister family is preparing for a Christmas vacation in Paris. On the night before their departure, the entire family gathers at Peter and Kate's home, where their son, Kevin, is ridiculed by his siblings and cousins. After a scuffle with his older brother, Buzz, Kevin is sent to the third floor of the house, where he wishes that his family would disappear. During the night, heavy winds cause damage to power lines, which causes the alarm clocks to reset; consequently, the family oversleeps. In the confusion and rush to get to the airport in time to catch their flight, Kevin is accidentally left behind.Later, Kevin wakes up to find the house empty and, thinking his wish has come true, is overjoyed with his new-found freedom. However, Kevin's joy turns to fear as he encounters his next door neighbor, ""Old Man"" Marley, who is rumored to have murdered his family with a snow shovel in 1958; he also encounters the ""Wet Bandits"", Harry and Marv, a pair of burglars who have been breaking into other vacant houses in the neighborhood and have targeted the McCallisters' house.

An Anomaly of the Genre,"Take a cheeky eight-year-old, put him in a situation he has to slapstick his way out of with the kind of antics most cartoon characters wouldn't survive, and what you have is one of the most wildly popular, commercially successful comedies of all time.  And when it's over, though most likely you'll have had a good time, you'll be tempted to ask the question:  Why? Because `Home Alone,' directed by Chris Columbus and written by John Hughes, is mediocre at best, though it does have it's moments.  It's a matter of the filmmakers being very astute, perhaps, and wisely mixing in a potpourri of elements with universal appeal and touching upon that common nerve they calculated would give just about anyone in the audience something to which they could relate.  And they were right.  Kids, Christmas, family, vacation, independence, a scary situation; it's all in here.  But, interestingly enough, it lacks the sentimental value that would seemingly have made this a movie one could truly embrace.  As it is, it's engaging fare, but somehow manages to keep the viewer at arm's length.  Then again, maybe that's even part of the appeal; it may be that audiences at this particular time and place were more comfortable just watching without having to invest anything of themselves in order to have a good time.This was, after all, 1990, and this film played to a generation weaned on more than a decade of Saturday Night Live, whose keen sense of biting satire and parody definitely had an influence on the mind-set of audiences everywhere.  And is that a bad thing?  No, absolutely not.  It merely points up one possible reason why a film centered around an eight-year-old with a somewhat derisive attitude could be so wholeheartedly received.  Also, it may be that the second half of the film, with it's over-the-top slapstick, is what made the final impression on the audience.  And this IS funny stuff; and it's going to get to even those who usually prefer humor that doesn't involve slapstick, because it's so well done.  Again, credit the filmmakers with having their fingers on the pulse of our culture and standards at the time.  But you also have to give credit to Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who bring the `Wet Bandits,' Harry and Marv,  to life, and know how to put across this kind of comedy, which is no easy task.The story itself is simple:  The extended McCallister family sets off for a Christmas vacation in Paris, and inadvertently, Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) gets left behind.  Left alone.  At home.  Where, rising to the occasion beyond anything even the most prodigious teenager could manage, he discovers the thrill of being independent and thwarts a pair of bungling burglars in the balance.  Meanwhile, mom and dad (Catherine O'Hara as Kate, John Heard as Peter) go out of their minds when they get to Paris and discover what has happened.  If only they knew what an ingenious and imaginative son they had...Culkin is certainly a cute kid, but can he act?  Well, the jury is still out on that one.  It's hard to say, since the dialogue he is given is so ridiculously above that of an eight-year-old, and the situations he encounters are so far-fetched, that there is no real frame of reference by which to consider it objectively.  His timing and rhythm are lacking, however, that much is clear.  His responses-- or, if you will, the punch lines he delivers-- are always a beat behind what they should be.  And it robs the humor of the spontaneity that would have made it funnier, even hilarious.  As it is, the only real laughs come from Kevin's assault on the Wet Bandits, and there are plenty to be had there.Pesci and Stern become the real stars of the show as they play out their slapstick antics, which are truly deserving of the laughs they generate. Their expressions of incredulity in the face of the violence that is visited upon them is what makes this movie.  Everything else merely sets the stage for Harry and Marv's descent into the maelstrom.  And what Pesci and Stern do here should not be taken for granted, nor taken lightly artistically.  To put this kind of humor across takes some real talent on the part of consummate professionals, and Pesci and Stern certainly deliver it.  Their secret?  They play it straight, which keeps the silliness out of it.  Had they played it strictly as farce, it simply wouldn't have had the same impact; but by playing to the characters in the situation, rather than to a situation involving characters, it works.  And, once again, chalk up another one for Columbus and Hughes, who really know how to deliver this kind of material.The only truly poignant moment in the film involves Kevin's encounter with a mysterious neighbor, `Old Man Marley,' played wonderfully by character actor/poet Roberts Blossom.  The revelation of his secret earlier in the film sets up the purest moment of the ending, and though it is brief, it's inspired and adds a much needed perspective to the story.The supporting cast includes Devin Ratray (Buzz), Angela Goethals (Linnie), Gerry Bamman (Uncle Frank), Hillary Wolf (Aunt Leslie), Ralph Foody (Gangster Johnny), Billie Bird (Irene), Bill Erwin (Ed) and John Candy, memorable in the role of Gus Polinski, the Polka Band shuttle Chief. Considering the ratio between this movie's substance and the success it still enjoys today, `Home Alone' is something of an anomaly in the history of the genre.  it lacks insight, yet delivers some real belly laughs.  It lacks a single character the audience can truly embrace, yet is accepted overwhelmingly as is.  It lacks inspiration, yet is an inspired film in the way it is crafted and delivered.  It's one you're probably going to like and enjoy, but upon reflection may wonder, `Why.'  And the answer?  Who can say. Go figure.  It's the magic of the movies.  6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Juvenile humor, but the ending sequences are great.","I've always been rather fond of the ""little guy"" finally showing the ""big guy"" that it's not safe to assume that you can get away with anything you want.  Although the first half or more of this movie is of the sort of humor that really turns me off, the revenge of the little guy is beautifully done, and the bad guys (who are delightfully inept) get exactly what's coming to them.If you enjoy the ""Coyote/RoadRunner"" cartoons, you'll certainly enjoy the latter portions of this movie.

The Best Christmas Film of the Past 20 Years,"""Home Alone"" is a hilarious film about a young boy (Macaulay Culkin) who is accidently left home during the Christmas holidays after the rest of his family goes to Europe.  At first Culkin loves the situation, but soon he is scared to death when he learns that burglars Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are targeting his house.  However, Culkin is pretty smart for an eight-year-old and he has plans for them when they attack.  Chris Columbus' direction is smart and so is the over-achieving screenplay.  This film has a little bit of something for everyone and the fact that the backdrop is the Christmas holidays, only makes it that much more special.

100% Entertainment Guaranteed!,"My all time favorite film. Macaulay Culkin did superbly as a child actor, but as he grew up, he simply disappeared into oblivion. His last good film being Ritchie Rich (1994), live-action film adaptation of the Harvey Comics comic book character Richie Rich.So from his highest grossing film Home Alone to Richie Rich is only a 4 year reign.In this film we have the pairing of two talented actors in Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern(I REALLY LIKE THE WAY THIS GUY ACTS & HIS SENSE OF HUMOR!!!). They are a pair of burglars Harry Lyme (Pesci) and Marv Merchants (Stern), specializing in housebreaking when the occupants are off on holiday. This time its on Christmas. The McCallister's have planned a trip to Paris. Meanwhile Harry has his sights set on the McCallister House.However things don't necessarily go as planned... Kevin has been forgotten at home and the McCallister's realize this too late.Now Kevin is all alone against a duo of hardened(?), professional(?) crooks. 2 vs. 1 is not a fair fight(or so you think...).What happens next is why this film has become the most grossing American comedy film of 1990. I WON'T reveal what happens next, so either go see it at a Cinema you like or watch it on DVD/CABLE or ONLINE or buy the DVD either at a DVD store or online.This film has a decent sequel: Home Alone 2: Lost in New York which follows the further mishaps in the life of Kevin.Other Macaulay Culkin films worth seeing/having: Uncle Buck, The Good Son, My Girl, Getting Even with Dad, and Richie Rich.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

An insult both for a child and adult viewer.,"I had never seen this and got the opportunity recently when the child in my life begged to rent it as she had heard wonderful things about it.I expected fluff, a simplistic plot and two hours of enduring the smarmy child actor Macauley Culkin. Not too bad a trade off so that the child would enjoy a movie she wanted to see.Oh dear. Halfway through it I looked at her and said what would you rate this one out of 10? 5, was the response. We are expected to believe that an 8 year old who cannot tie his own shoelaces comes up with incredible booby traps for some burglars who want to rob the house (rigging lines between trees, heating up door knobs to name very few out of many). One with a master's in engineering would not be able to figure out most of them.But the very worst features were these dim-bulb parents who sit in first class while their children go unsupervised in economy on a flight to Paris (9 hours, people!)who cannot fire up a brain cell between them in Paris to get the police, Children's Aid, emergency services (they never have friends and relatives in Hollywoodland)to go to the house and get the child.How hard is it to count your children when you have only three??? The child has not been streetproofed and does not know to call 911 either. And on and on.It is one of the most appalling movies I have ever seen. At the end the child and I agreed, 4 out of 10.The old man (Roberts Blossom) was sweet and Catherine O'Hara, whom I normally admire, is right up there with horror moms of all time.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hilarious movie with a tight cast!!!,"There is no film to put beside Home Alone by way of comparison. It is a film genre of it's own. I read and hear reviews of this movie that express disgust and horror and I picture John Hughes chuckling. This was the intent, it was meant to upset the status quo and in ""politically correct"" times that we live in, isn't it a small surprise to see this film come to the forefront again? This is a movie that will freak out the uptight for as long as it exists in any media. It was meant to. As much as ""Clockwork Orange"" talked about ""ultraviolence"" this movie is all about ultra-bad pranks. We can numb ourselves to sex and violence but Home Alone is a movie you just will never get used to. There will be something in this movie that will get to you. As a last resort to make sure everyone is offended before you leave the theatre, John includes the always discussed paint can scene. No reason for this scene, except to make sure he gets you and also to make sure you leave talking about it. Obviously filmed on a budget, and using Hughe's stock cast, this is a movie simply about a young kid whose parents forget him while they go on vacation. All the characters are bizarre in one way or another. This movie reminds me of ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" in that everyone in the film has something odd about them and both movies joyfully celebrate these uniquenesses.

Cute... but not much else,"This is an odd one; I can't tell you how many times I've seen this film, yet every time is like the first. It just makes no lasting impression, and I'm always left feeling kind of cheated. The real problem here is that the only truly entertaining thing in the film(not the only funny, mind you) are the scenes of Kevin scaring off the burglars and the finale(which I won't write here, in case anyone reading this review hasn't seen the film yet). That's it. The rest of the film, sure, there are funny scenes, lines and such... but no real entertainment. The scenes of Kevin by himself, in the house, doing adult stuff are cute, but once you're over the age of ten, you won't really find them entertaining or funny... maybe you won't even see the charm I'm certain I must have seen in the scenes when I was younger. So what are we left with? Plenty of humor, some of which actually works and a few scenes of entertainment. About ten minutes of actual entertainment scattered over just over 100 minutes of film. That's just not enough. The plot is decent, but derivative and unoriginal. The characters are cardboard cutouts. The acting is fine, but no one is particularly impressive. John Williams' score is pretty good. What really bugs me about this film is the portrayal of violence as fun, and OK as long as it's against criminals. This is a film for children; is it really a good idea to show violence like that? To make it fun... and OK? I recommend this film only to people who are too smart to copy it... and it helps if you have a childish sense of humor. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
WHEN HOLLYWOOD GETS IT RIGHT!,"If you're reading this in 2021, then you should know that it was exactly 31 years ago, in the month of November, that Home Alone was released in theaters. That striking fact alone is quite revealing, particularly because this film hasn't ""aged"" at all and is still artistically and cinematically relevant even today.There is very little I say about this absurdly entertaining film that likely hasn't been thoroughly covered already. Home Alone is arguably the quintessential modern day holiday film that could only come from the exceptionally gifted mind of the late writer/director/producer, John Hughes. .I purchased the Family Fun Edition DVD for the generous wealth of ""extras"" which include a camera interview with child star Macaulay Culkin, loads of deleted scenes, featurettes, a handful of games, and even a optional commentary track with the director, Chris Columbus, and the featured star, Macaulay Culkin.As always, no spoilers here, but I will reveal that in ""real life"" co-star Daniel Stern has morbid arachnophobia (fear of spiders).",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Christmas Classic? Yes. Great film? Well...,"This film was definitely loved when it came out, and now it's seen as a Christmas classic. Do I agree with that? Well, yes, in different ways then others see it. I saw this recently after many years of not seeing it with a more critical mindset. It's a decent movie, but it's not great. You see, when I say it's a ""Christmas classic"" I don't mean it's a great movie. My reason for my usage of the term ""Christmas classic"" is because there aren't many great Christmas movies out there. Besides Elf, and Christmas Story, there aren't a lot of great Christmas movies.It certainly is a good movie to watch around Christmas, but it does have its flaws and problems. Macaulay Culkin is pretty good in this movie, as well as Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, but the rest of the actors aren't too good. The story has a lot of flaws. First of all, why doesn't Kevin go to a friends' house? Surely not everyone he knows has gone to Paris or something. He lives in a suburban neighbourhood in Chicago with a BUNCH of people, and he can't go to a friends' house? All these flaws I can kinda look past, but I can't pretend they're not there. This film is good, but not great.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Angels with Filthy Souls: Die Hard for Kids,"Another amusing Christmas heist flick ripping off ""Die Hard"" (1988), as others have pointed out already--complete with family problems, a protagonist practically breaking the fourth wall by cracking jokes alone, and bleeding feet--""Home Alone"" is a lot funnier than I remembered it being. The cast is great. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern mug it up. Catherine O'Hara is always good, even if her full comedic talents are underutilized here relative to her parts in Christopher Guest mockumentaries or the TV series ""Schitt's Creek."" Besides, her character is the only member of the family who really seems to care that they forgot a child across the Atlantic Ocean and then some. Roberts Blossom should talk more in this one, because his manner of lip smacking in between short phrases is ASMR triggering. John Candy on another holiday road trip--this time talking about abandoning his little one with a corpse at a funeral parlor. And, of course, Macaulay Culkin. Boy, that kid was famous--probably hasn't been a child movie star that big since and, besides Shirley Temple and Jackie Coogan, before.Besides breaking fourth walls with the raise of eyebrows, his Kevin enjoys time to himself, eats and watches trash, sleds down staircases, cares about hygiene and keeps a tidy home when not destroying his brother's room or mutilating criminals, shows interest in his hobby of using stuff around the house for an elaborate home security system, and screams into the void every once in a while. I mean, he's got life figured out. Granted, he gets whiny about missing his family after only a couple days, but he's only eight years old, so I suppose that may be forgiven. It's just a fun film. The early hectic family scenes, including the rush to the airport, make this enjoyable from the start, and the film-within-the-film parodying ""Angels with Dirty Faces"" (1938) is a gas, as well. To top it off, they got John Williams to do the score.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Home Alone,"An eight year old boy is left home alone at Christmas when his family leave for a France vacation, not realizing he isn't on the plane with them. Two crooks attempt to rob the family home, and it is up to Kevin to protect the place! Home Alone is one of my all time favourite Christmas movies, I couldn't get enough of it as a kid growing up. There was something powerful as a child seeing another child around the same age face the bad guys and be able to defeat them.Home Alone is basically about a family that leaves for vacation, but in the rush of getting out on time they forget that young Kevin McCallister was not with them on their way to the airport. So while they take off for Paris, Kevin wakes up to find that he is all alone in this gigantic house. It's all fun and games at first for Kevin, until he discovers that a pair of thieves plan on robbing his house thinking that the place is empty. Whiz kid Kevin sets up a number of booby traps and set ups that severely injure the bandits. Examples include one of the thieves named Harry getting his head set on fire, the other Marv gets hit in the head with an iron. These kind of stunts could kill a person in real life, but the magic of movies allows the bandits to shake it off and continue their mischief.The acting in Home Alone is top notch! Macaulay Culkin is brilliant as Kevin McCallister, the scared yet empowered young boy who takes on the ""Wet Bandits"". Those bandits are played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who add so much to the film with their performance. And you get some good screen time from stars such as Catherine O'Hara, John Heard and even John Candy. The traps that Kevin sets are smart and witty, and the location shots are perfect for the tricks he has planned for Harry and Marv.All in all Home Alone is a classic film not only for Christmastime, but all year round. This should be seen by everyone at least once.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A blockbuster with cartoon violence and funny gags from prolific writer John Hughes.,"An eight-year-old troublemaker, mistakenly left home alone, Kevin is accidentally left behind when his entire and large family makes a frantic rush for the airport to a Paris journey. That's the plausible part, he is alone and besieged by botcher burglars. As two thieves come on the scene to liven things up. The issue is how Kevin must defend his home against a pair of bungling burglars on Christmas Eve. Getting wise to their plans, Kevin decides to use bobby traps at his suburban house. The bad guys start out in serious vein, which is good, but the nature of these things force them to become comic in the inevitable siege at the Kevin's house. Holy cow!. Bring Home The Laughter This Holiday Season!. When Kevin's family left for vacation, they forgot one minor detail: Kevin. But don't worry... He cooks. He cleans. He kicks some butt !. He's home alone. A family comedy without the family !.This megahit produces genuine laughs, violent jokes, amusement, entertainment and incorporating fresh material. Macaulay Culkin is as adorable as ever with supporting cast all delivering fine interpretations. Although with an unlikely premise triggering the story, Kevin turns into a pint-sized Rambo defending his suburban castle with the resources and wile of a boy genius with a perfect timing and unlimited eherewithal. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern steal the show , they're the targets of Culkin's wrath, enact painful slapstick (in Coyote-Road Runner style) with considerable vigor , while John Candy has a small but fun part as the leader of a polka band traveling cross-country with mom Catherine O'Hara. Adding other fine secondaries, such as: John Heard, Robert Blosson, Billie Bird, Kieran Culkin, Devin Ratray, Kristin Minter. The high-grossing movie of 1990 , surpassing ¨Jaws¨and ¨Ghost¨. This succesul film loaded with shameless gags was well directed by Chris Colombus.Followed by ¨Home alone: Lost in New York¨ (1992) by Chris Colombus with Macaulay Culkin, Daniel Stern, Joe Pesci, Tim Curry, Brenda Fricker, Eddie Bracken, Rob Schneider, Dana Ivey, Catherine O'Hara, John Heard, it was a almost exact duplication of the original; boarding the wrong plane , troublemaker Kevin lands in NYC, where he meets crooks Pesci y Stern as prison escapees ; not so much a sequel, more of an action replay but even more violent than the original. ¨Home Alone 3¨ (1997) by Raja Gosnell (editor of the two previous films) with Alex D Linz taking over for the teenaged Culkin, Kevin Kilner, Olek Krupa, Lenny Van Dohlen, Haviland Morris, Scarlett Johansson; here some international criminals trying to recover a microchip stashed in a toy car that has the mistakenly left home alone Alex Linz, while attempting to foil their plans, this sequel fails to carry the charm of its predecessors.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"If it wasn't for Pesci, I would have given it a 1.","This is just one movie that I cannot stand.  I am not wild about movies that are mainly about kids who get the best of adults, and this definitely fits the bill as one of those movies.  What really gets me, is this kid would not have gotten into all the trouble he did if he wasn't such a brat.  The family is trying to organize this big trip with all these other relatives, and all the their younger son can do is whine and complain.  ""I don't want to sleep with that kid"", ""I have to have my pizza a certain way"", stuff like that...and he is supposed to be the kid we are pulling for?  We get to see him left alone and do all the things kids do when they are left alone. Watch black and white old movies.  Yes, and this kid is such a wimp that a black and white mobster pick scares him.  Though he uses it so wisely later in the movie (yeah right, that would work).  This kid somehow outsmarts the two thieves even though earlier one of them is smart enough to impersonate a police officer and check all the security of the houses in the neighborhood. I guess his intelligence went down a notch or two.  Then there are the many clever traps that usually consist of someone getting hit in the groin area...ha ha ha!  It is always so funny to see someone get hit there and writhe in agony.  All in all this is just one bad movie that I did not care for at all.  I just wish the kid got into some kind of trouble for all the problems he caused.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A magic formula,"It's been more than thirty years since this film was released and I confess that, having seen it at the cinema at the time and found it amusing, in its unpretentious style of mainstream Christmas entertainment, I never thought it would become a classic that my adult son and cinephile, asked me to review with him.I thought it didn't even shows aging (well, today it would be a scandal to base a Christmas comedy on a couple who goes on vacation and forgets a child at home, at the very least they would have custody removed and the child given up for adoption), but it remains a fun movie. An irresistible combination that makes it an enormous and apparently lasting success: Christmas, a comedy accessible to the general public and a child as the protagonist.

Home for the Holidays,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time as well as one of my favorite Christmas films.It's also another one of my childhood gems, it's was just so much fun for so many reasons but also heartfelt at the same time. I really like the plotline as it's sort of a wishfulment fantasy being the man or woman of the house and just having complete freedom to do whatever you want and make your own rules.There is so much to like, from the production value, which is great, really like how the traps were set up and conducted. Even the music is great, from some soundtrack bits but it's really the score by one of my favorite composers John Williams which makes it the most memorable. From that theme song which is one of my favorite themes of all time, as it has both a Christmas tune but at the same time a sense of foreboding as it reminds us as fun and cheerful as the film is there is still trouble in paradise. But another tune which is ""All of my Memories"" is just beautiful and perfectly reflects the theme of the film.I really like the characters, from the Wet Bandits Harry and Marv played well by Joe Pechi and Daniel Stern. Both your classic comic duo much like Abbot and Costello and any other you can think about, both are so much fun as both are pretty much numb skulls.Well Harry is more the smart one of the bunch as it seems like he the only one that really supplies the brain power of their schemes. However, this guy is no genius as his Achilles heel is that he's arrogant thinking he's so clever and listens too much to his own greed which we know both these things can make people stupid or do some stupid crap.Marv is pretty much Harry's flunky as he's dumb. But what makes him really funny is how he's a bit of a man child sometimes, like having these delusions of grangur in being one of the most famous criminals in history by leaving the water running as their calling card as ""The Wet Bandits"", despite the fact he clearly needs a reality check as he's just increased their chances of getting caught and identified. But I really love some of his lines, he's got some great lines, one of my favorites ""he sounded like a snake"" I know a small line but it's funny on two counts.But of course, my favorite character is the main protagonist Kevin McCallister played well by Macaulay Culkin. I really like that he's not some stereotypical annoying all smiles kid. Kevin really felt like a real kid whom is a relatable character as some of what he's gone though is some of the things that we may have experienced a time or two in our lives when we were kids.It's interesting what kind of household he lives in which must be the busiest household I've ever seen as it seems populated with twenty plus people. I remember whenever I watch the film, I always wonder who that person or the other in the family is. I honestly wouldn't mind if they made some sort of TV program (on a premium channel) called ""The McCallister's"" where we could see Kevin and the rest of the family years later, get to know the rest of them and see what shanagans they get into. If not there's always a licensed comic book, follow up; and if one or both these happened it would be the true third sequel. Well, it's a nice thought anyway.Alright back to Kevin, he's charismatic, has some of the best lines in the film. My favorite from him is ""This is it, don't get scared now"" yeah that's the kind of line I use whenever there is a final battle in certain Horror movies or survival horror video games. The film is almost at times like a one man play sometimes as in most scenes Kevin has only himself to talk to, but he does it so well because he's got a lot of interesting things to say.I really love how smart he is, this guy you could say could almost be a genius as he's a tactician, from building those elaborate traps. However, he is still naive like a child which increases the relatability factor as we've been through that. Like one of my favorite scenes is seeing Kevin dig though Buzz's trunk and he first looks though a Playboy magazine and says one really funny line that cracked me up ""No clothes on anyone sickening"", yeah that what most of us and myself felt at Kevin's age.However, the one thing about him that makes him the most enduring is he is highly sympathetic. He has a big family but he is the only one that is the most underappreciated, doesn't really get much attention nor help when he needs and asks for it, none of the breaks and for some fraked up reason seems to be the target of ridicule for most family members, seriously what the frak is everyone's problem.Like in one scene he is trying to ask some people to help him pack a suitcase as he's never done it before, which is understandable because he's still really little which means there are a lot of things, he's never done himself before. But of course no one is or wants to help him do it, seriously not one member could take five to ten minutes of their life to show/help him pack, it wouldn't of killed them instead they act like they have more important things to do which they don't.The worst of all is Buzz, this is a guy you sort of love to hate as he's kind of funny or even just plain hate as he really presses a wrong button with you. What I really don't like about the guy is that he's is just so full of crap; from that story he tells both Kevin and another brother about a neighbor you just see as he's telling that he has a crap eating grin on his face, so you know the story is bull crap just to get cheap amusement. And another which was eating Kevin's Cheese Pizza on purpose and insulting Kevin once more, thinking he's so funny which pushes Kevin over the edge.I really love that Kevin retaliated, I'd do the same thing any bully that ever takes away my Cheese Pizza or even video game playing are going to meet Goku and Vegetta (my left and right fists); I know that sounds bold but human right need to be defended.Sadly, Kevin unfortunately get punished for something that wasn't his fault, let alone doesn't even have dinner. But the last part of that scene are really sad when instead of the mom talking and exercising understanding with Kevin to hear what really happened, she just retorts in a mocking and insulting tone, which I thought was uncool, I guess she forgot the old saying ""if you have nothing nice to say, don't say anything at all"" At that moment I just knew that was the final straw and Karma was about to come down on the family hard.There are so many great and memorable scenes and moments throughout the film, so there is hardly a dull moment.One of my favorite scenes no doubt is when Kevin is watching a gangster pic and of course he's eating probably the biggest ice cream sundae I've ever seen, man I can never eat that many scoops. That film he watches is great, I honestly thought that was a real movie but no it's not. This is something as kids we always dreamed about which was to see Rated R films without restrictions.I just love the exaggerated nature of the film as we see the lead gangster Johnny solve his dilemma with a Tommy Gun (yeah that does work every time in those pics) and he just says one of my favorite movie quotes that cracked me up, ""Keep the change you filthy animal."" But I really like Kevin's reaction to that film as he's closing his eyes despite the fact there is no gore or squib effects. But for a kid his age that would be considered graphically violent and not something he's totally used to seeing. And this joke with the gangster movie gets funnier as we see it used in two different scenes in two different ways.And of course, there is the famous big battle near the end of the film which is in my book one of my favorite battles of all time. It's basically a home invasion battle which I think is cool because it's sort of like a strategy game battle, since the battle takes place on your own turf it makes you the general, giving you plenty of opportunities to tactically take out invaders whichever area they occupy. But of course, it's pretty much a slap stick/ physical comedy fest as we see the Wet Bandits constantly getting hurt by Kevin's traps and miraculously surviving, this was just hilarity at it's best, it made me laugh till it hurt.I'll just say a couple of my favorites as I don't want to give too much away, from the first scene seeing Kevin use the BB gun on both robbers, it's just funny how Harry reacts to the pain and he is just saying a bunch of gibberish in frustration.Another of course is the nail trap, it's funny because of just the delayed reaction as it pain doesn't even register until a little latter and I just laughed along the way.However, despite all the fun of the film this film has heart as the revolving theme is about appreciating family. There is one scene I found sad when Kevin is looking at a family whom is home for the holiday's enjoying Christmas, he has a sad look on his face, which I'll admit put a tear in my eye. That scene shows what Kevin truly wanted which was simply to have Christmas with his family. Or even some bits with the family feeling guilt over the loss of Kevin from the mom evaluating her own parenting and a member or two not enjoying their time in Paris as they know in their hearts it's not a real vacation as their family is incomplete.This just makes the pay off even sweeter, I'll just say both Kevin and the Macalister's get what they want for Christmas. No one is ever alone for the holidays as long as there are still people that love you.Rating: 4 stars",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""You guys give up, or are ya thirsty for more?""","Eight year old Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin, in his appealing break through lead performance) is frustrated enough with his family to ""wish them away"". And he gets this wish, sort of, when the entire family - parents, siblings, aunt & uncle & cousins included - is in such a rush to get to the airport in time for a trip to Paris that they leave him behind. At first, he has great fun with his temporary freedom and independence, but will eventually have to save his house from being burgled by a bumbling pair of oafs, Harry and Marv, played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. This he does by staging an elaborate series of booby traps.""Home Alone"" is a pretty charming little family comedy that does have quite a bit of heart to go along with all of the farce and slapstick. This material is indeed pretty funny, with Pesci and Stern playing their slow witted lowlife criminals for all that they're worth; some of their facial expressions and reactions are just hysterical. Some of it may be a bit much, and may not jibe that well with the more serious portions of the movie, but it's doubtful many kids watching are going to care that much.It does, in the end, make a very good case for the need for family, how we're perfectly capable of taking our loved ones for granted, how to deal with one's fears and do some growing up, and in the case of Old Man Marley (the excellent veteran Roberts Blossom), how it's never too late to mend relationships. The wonderful scene between Culkin and Blossom in the church where they make a connection is indeed the best moment in the entire picture. Kevin's been administered (erroneous) warnings about the old man's supposedly sordid past, and is understandably afraid of him, and realizes how one shouldn't be too quick to believe that sort of thing.Lovely funny woman Catherine O'Hara also does extremely well in the role of the mother willing to do anything that's humanly possible in order to atone for what she feels is an unforgivably stupid mistake. It's truly a treat to see her reunited with 'SCTV' co-star John Candy, who's as engaging as ever in his cameo role as polka star Gus Polinski. John Williams supplies an expectantly catchy score and touching song (both Oscar nominated, with song lyrics by Leslie Bricusse).Good fun overall, with a bright wrap- up, it's not surprising that the movie would have been such an enormous hit over 20 years ago, and it continues to entertain today.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Fluffy Holiday Mayhem With a Warm Heart,"Basically a live-action Wile E. Coyote / Roadrunner Christmas, with a few humanist subplots thrown in for good measure. John Hughes comedies have often struggled to indulge the author's wackier side without stumbling too far into the realm of slapstick, and Home Alone never really finds that balance. There's a lot of effective material here - the sweet old neighbor's redemption story; Kevin's first steps toward independence; his mother's frantic, airport-skipping quest to get home - but those deeper themes feel too scattered, obvious second (or third) fiddles to the more bombastic third-act fireworks.The production also feels loose and cheap, rife with overdone performances, blunt direction and easy, convenient physical gags. Macaulay Culkin's acting in the lead is borderline unbearable, and the cache of gimmicks and booby traps that fuel his story often asks far too much of the audience. As I mentioned above, growth is a major part of his character arc, but right from the start, most of his word choices and the breadth of his worldly knowledge seems highly suspect for the pampered youngest son of a large, well-off suburban family. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern pick up some slack as a duo of over-amplified burglar stereotypes, played with a wink and a nudge at just the right moments, and Catherine O'Hara shines in a rare straight role as the flustered mother an ocean away from her youngest child.Straightforward and light for the majority of its run time, the film works best when it remembers to pluck the heartstrings with a few season-specific character moments and subplots. Still, it's all too detached from reality, with a strange habit of glorifying and celebrating its frequent scenes of grisly, wince-inducing violence.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Does It Deserve Its Popularity?,"Everybody tries hard, but ""Home Alone"" doesn't work nearly as well as its popularity suggests. Macaulay Culkin became a household name starring as Kevin McCallister, a precocious eight-year-old accidentally left behind when his family heads out on a holiday vacation. If fending for himself weren't enough, Kevin must also contend with two bumbling burglars (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern), who have targeted the family home.I first saw ""Home Alone"" when I was 10 years old. I didn't find it at all funny then, and its genius still eludes me. The alleged ""humor"" that everyone seems to love stems mainly from a series of violent booby traps Kevin sets up to stop the bad guys. Among the deterrents the burglars so wittingly fall for is a red-hot doorknob. Looks painful, but hardly funny. The film tries to handle such physical abuse like an old Road Runner cartoon, but when the action involves real people instead of an animated coyote, something is lost.Yet ""Home Alone"" isn't a total disaster. The performances are great and the story is at times quite charming, particularly the subplot involving the supposedly scary old neighborhood man.

31.12.2023 Five hours before the New Year...,"""Home Alone"" is already a New Year's classic. I am writing a review a few hours before the New Year 2024, the time is more suitable than ever!The film is a comedy, the action takes place, as it is clear, on Christmas Eve, the idea is quite original, the actors also did their job well.I also want to say that I am not an ardent fan of this movie and do not watch it every New Year, but it is worth recognizing the cult significance and overall interest of the plot of ""Home Alone"".I would recommend watching this movie at least once in a New Year's mood to feel the rush of the atmosphere. It's worth it!My rating : 7.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Great Fun,"Home Alone (1990)*** (out of 4)Blockbuster dealing with eight-year-old Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) who after a fight with his family wishes that he never has to see them again. The next day Kevin wakes up with his family no where to be found. He believes that his hopes have been answered but soon he's having to deal with a couple burglars (Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern) who have their eyes on his house.If you were around in 1990 then you will remember the tremendous success that HOME ALONE had with critics, fans and at the box office. To say the film was a landmark would be an understatement because the film was a huge hit and has gained plenty of fans over the years. After twenty-six years I think it's safe to say that the film is a new classic. While the film isn't perfect it's certainly a lot of fun and perfectly captures the manic spirit of Christmas time.What makes the film work so well is that it's a perfect child fantasy. I'm sure many kids have wished that they were the boss, the keeper of the house and that the adults would just go away. This film works perfectly fulfilling that fantasy but of course there's the more touching moments thrown in for good measure. What makes the film a classic are the battles between the kid and the burglars. Culkin, Pesci and Stern would all become household names after this film and it's easy to see why.Culkin is absolutely adorable as the brat kid who finds himself home alone and doing battle against his fears as well as the two bad guys. The violence in the film is in the same field as The Three Stooges and it works perfectly well. Not only does the violence work but it's perfectly sold by Pesci and Stern who are terrific and easily steal the film as Harry and Marv. The two of them have perfect chemistry together and they really make for a great comic team.The supporting cast is very good with the likes of John Heard, Roberts Blossom, Catherine O'Hara and John Candy all doing fine work. Another major plus is the score from John Williams as well as an all-around great charm. The film contains some great laughs throughout and I think after all these years it's fair to call it a classic.",,Anonymous,Comedy

One of the best Christmas movies ever made.,"An eight year old boy is accidentally left at home by his family, his mission, to defend the family home, using only objects from the house to make traps and ingenious defence systems.How on Earth do you even review a movie like Home Alone, all I can say, is that over Christmas 2023, I must have watched this movie three or four times, that says it all.It's wonderful, truly wonderful, fun, entertaining, zany, which kid didn't contemplate the idea of being left home alone, to fend for themselves, it works on every single level.It's not a film you can take too seriously, sometimes when you look back at films from the 80's and 90's, you can take them too literally, the basic idea of a family leaving an eight year old boy behind, well it just wouldn't happen, but who cares, it's entertainment.You'll want to download 'Rockin around the Christmas tree' by Brenda Lee after watching it.We will never get films like this one ever again.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Adequate,"Home Alone is a holiday classic from a simpler time. Back when cheesiness was normal and nauseating wholesomeness was all the rage, Home Alone excelled. The film's massive success is both obvious and perplexing because it is as safe as possible. Empty familial platitudes and buffoonish threats give the illusion of a journey without challenging audiences. It's warm, cozy, and topped off with cartoonish violence. What did Kevin and his family really learn? Will Kevin continue to be neglected? Did any character actually arc? Despite wanting to buy into the sentimentality, some viewers might find Home Alone hollow.These feelings extend to the actual filmmaking of Home Alone as well. The cinematography throws in some shadows, POVs, and framing, but the visuals are mostly rudimentary. The same goes for the editing, production, and sound, all of which rarely enhance the experience. The effects are memorable but fairly simple, and the direction is cohesive but generic. Undoubtedly, the music is the greatest strength of Home Alone because it carries all the emotional weight that the film is selling. Ultimately, Home Alone is an adequate movie that broke through as an icon.Writing: 6/10

Sickeningly sweet-TO SWEET.,"If I had to pick a movie that was a smash that did absolutely nothing for me Home Alone would be at the top of the list. Oh, I'm not saying the movie was awful. But overated yes and after all these years, I still don't get the appeal.I'm an adult but was fairly young when this came out-and I love all types of movies. This movie's premise bothered me, seeing a kid get terrorized by robbers,even in a comedic sense, was not my cup of tea and I spent most of the movie feeling sorry for the poor kid who got left behind and wishing the movie would end. Yes, Mcauley Culkin was cute-but aside from that, I don't think Home Alone rates more then a 5.5 maybe a 6. I have definetly seen better kid movies, family movies etc. It was hyped so much and so sickeningly sappy, the most I could say about it is that it's a ""cute"" little movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Average Film,Home Alone(1990) is a mediocre movie with an uneasy amount of cartoonish violence.  The problem with the film is the characters do things that most people would not normally do.  Joe Pesci is wasted in this movie as he gives the only interesting performance of the entire movie.  One sad thing about this movie is that this may be the only film that Macaulay Culkin will be known mainly for.  Its a fine film for the holidays but not as an overall viewing experience.,,Anonymous,Comedy
Stands the test of time,"I must confess: I really like ""Home Alone"".  It's part of popular culture for good reason.  I'm not going to try and defend Culkin's acting, except to say that worse child performances than his have been considered charming (as in the somewhat overrated ""A Christmas Story"").  This movie is charming, memorable, indeed touching, and perfectly paced so that the hilariously extreme violence that is its trademark (a really fresh perspective on slapstick, in my opinion) starts late and builds to an actual climax.  By contrast, most of the movies in this genre drag on and on with no real development and little cohesion, and could end at almost any arbitrary moment, i.e. ""Baby Geniuses"", ""Mouse Hunt"", ""Look Who's Talking Too"". (Why did I ever watch those, anyway?)  Anyway, very well made, good supporting performances, shouldn't be dissed.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The near-perfect American family film,"I saw and loved HOME ALONE as a kid, particularly enjoying all the 'home invasion' traps that Kevin McCallister set up for the bad guys. Watching it nowadays, I'm surprised to see that this sequence only takes up the last quarter of the movie; before then there's a surprisingly complex storyline with some good sub-plots to keep it moving nicely along.That this also turns out to be a classic film which has lost none of its warmth and magic is the biggest surprise. Yes, Macaulay Culkin is more than a little annoying when you watch him as an adult - in fact, I remember him being annoying when I watched him as a kid - but you can forgive him because he's endearing nonetheless. Of the supporting cast, the ones who particularly shine are Joe Pesci (channelling some of that GOODFELLAS energy), Daniel Stern, and Roberts Blossom (DERANGED).The film was written by John Hughes, so the expected sentimentality is here, but somehow it never becomes too cloying - you can live with it, because there's plenty of good stuff elsewhere. That home invasion stuff is still superbly directed, surprisingly violent, and very funny, and there's so much ingenuity packed into the running time that this is a film impossible to dislike. In fact, I still love it.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Great Fun!,"And not to be taken too seriously, given the number of times the little boy goes out of the front door yet miraculously always gets back in without the need of A KEY! just one of the hiccups if you look closely. Roberts Blossom is the elderly, and as it turns out, friendly neighbour who have a lovely little ""turn""! The last quarter features the real fun when the criminals eventually decide to get into the house and the 8 year old is ready for them....cue - lots of fun and laughs, which given our current UK lockdown, this will ease some of the difficulties for a short while.

That Face Helped Make This A Big Hit,"This an absurd storyline. Hollywood loves to show movies in which kids are smarter than adults, for some reason. Also, we are expected to believe a big family can go all the way to the airport and then fly to France before finding out one of their kids was left at home??! I don't think so. I know a lot of big families and this would never-in-a-million years happen.However, it's just a movie, and it isn't real and you can't take any of it seriously. Thus, the idea is to go along with the wild premise and enjoy the antics that follow....and there are plenty of those!A share of the credit for the big success of this film should go to God, who made Maccaulay Culkin's face. Without it, I doubt this would have been anywhere near the hit is was, but Culkin's ""cuteness"" helps makes you root for him and his facial expressions provide a lot of laughs. He turned out to be a fine child actor.The two guys (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) that play incompetent crooks are funny and some of the humor is clever, although slapstick ""rules"" in this film.There are some really nice messages in here, such as ""families suck,"" says the kid.

Humor is a poor substitute for intelligence,"First off, I would like to say that John Hughes has fallen in ability since Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.  This movie is a shining example of that. My sister saw it when it was first released in 1990 and told me that ""it sucked"", she was in third grade.  I didn't see it until last week and can almost agree with that, but not totally.  As far as so-called 'Holiday movies' go, Die Hard and Gremlins will remain my pop culture mainstay.Home Alone racks up plot holes faster than the Wet Bandits fall down.  They are so dumb that they make the Three Stooges look like the Untouchables.  To think that Joe Pesci belittles himself into a role like this is beyond my belief.  Being outsmarted by an eight-year-old is not the best thing to include on his film resume.  The film would have ended a good 30 minutes earlier if Kevin had acted like a normal kid and don't the smart thing instead of being a defensive snot.Chris Columbus has always had a fascination with kiddie comedies and this is not his best effort.  Thankfully he is not so much in the pursuit of money (as with Harry Potter) as he is with the pursuit of political correctness. It's not surprising that the script it Hughes' work, there are so many of his little touches throughout.If I can say one good thing about this movie, it's the music.  John Williams KNOWS how to write music and this movie is a perfect example.  The film certainly has a nice Christmas ring that contrasts with the ever cloudy skies.Overall, there are good movies for the holidays and good movies for kids. This one might fit their bill, but everyone else will find it to be a watch-checker after a while.  2 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Comedy

Guilty pleasure in an implausible movie,"This movie stretches credibility to its limits. Sure, it's a comedy, so it can get away with some stuff. A kid is more competent than everyone else in an upper-middle-class family and he gets stuck at home because the family doesn't count its kids right. Two dimwitted crooks set out to burglarize a house believing that the family is away for the holiday; the kid is there, and he is a menace.The kid has an engineering talent freakishly developed for a ten-year-old kid and the sadistic cleverness that that he exposes in creating Rube Goldberg-like devices for tormenting a pair of burglars who fail to get the message that there really is someone there. I know that the garden variety of crooks are usually on the low side on intellectual development, but one time would be enough -- right? How many times do those crooks have to take falls, burns, and sharp objects into them before they learn?It's somewhat fun -- if you can pass up the stupidity, the gaps in the plot, and the mean-spiritedness beneath a saccharine veneer.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Somethings wrong with rating....,"How could this film get only a 6.5?Yes, it's a kid's movie, but I know plenty of adults(not including myself) who loved this film. It touches our hearts, and tickles our funny bones. Not to mention I think in one way or another we could relate to it. That's why it remains a classic Christmas comedy.Home Alone is not only one of the highest box office successes of all time, but it deserves more praise. Mac showed a talent that very little child stars have now-a-days. He brought in a great comedy about a boy who accidentally is left home alone when his family goes on vacation and takes on two burglars.Yeah, it's quit unrealistic about the burglars, but honestly, this is a terrific family film. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are the perfect comedy duo of two idiots who can't rob the place because a 8 year old child has out witted them and set some clever and very funny traps around the house.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Good Family Film with Tom & Jerry style violence,"A picked-on 8 year old kid (a surprisingly competent performance from Macaulay Culkin before he grew up to be a bigger kid!) is left home-alone by a family taking a Christmas vacation to Paris. Expecting a quiet few days on his own he has to contend with a couple of inept burglars with his own inventive traps & bouts of violence.A very simple film with a sugary & predictable message at the end. But inspite of the thread-bare plot it is a very enjoyable romp, perhaps because of the rather inventive but uncomplicated writing from John Hughes.The film only really comes alive during the battle of wits between Culkin & the two robbers (well supported by Pesci & Stern) while the rest of the film just trundles along at a rather predictable pace.I saw this film back in 91 and found it quite funny (still do in fact). But at that time I hadn't really had much chance to see other Pesci movies of the time.But now, some 10 years on everytime I see Pesci screaming in agony as he suffers more comic violence from the inventive little brat I keep thinking he's going to go into Goodfellas or Casino mode and pull out a gun along with a hail of abusive language and shoot the kid full of bullets, or put his head in a vice.But anyway, Home Alone is a good family movie that doesn't stretch the mind and never really offends anyone although perhaps the Tom & Jerry style violence is perhaps a little too strong in places. Its a nicely packaged movie and I have to admit Culkin is very very good here. Best not mention the two limp sequels.***/*****",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Just plain stupid,"First off, wouldn't the family have realized they still hadn't given out an airplane ticket to someone, wouldn't that mean something to them right there in the beginning? This movie is centered all around the pathetic Christmas miracle theory.I have to ask when they realize that the kid has been left home alone by himself, why don't the parents just call the house, a friend neighbor, or even the police to go pick him up? They could even give the cops instructions to use a door-ram on an outside door to get in to the house and secure the kid. When the kid realizes that he has been left home alone, he could go straight to a friend neighbor, call local police, or even call 911.I also love the scenarios the kid supposedly comes up with by himself; first with the gangster movie scene to scare off the pizza delivery, I would hope if the delivery person had actually believed the scenario, that it would be immediately reported to the cops.Then the whole scenario when he realizes the two criminals are going to be trying to rob the house, he comes up with a plan to take them out in a couple hours, the plan nearly kills the criminals and almost burns down the house. After all of this is finished, the kid finally calls the police. If he knew this from the beginning he would have never logically done anything but first call a reliable emergency number.Once the criminals are taken out, he's still home alone and quickly cleans up the stuff that took the criminals out? Then his mom arrives, along with his whole family arriving shortly after. The family is suddenly all together again, was this a Christmas miracle?I will admit, the movie is fun before you're even a teenager, but when you look at it later on, you'll realize it's nothing but a pathetic joke. Logically, it nearly tells kids to do things dangerously while teaching them not to use things that are truly secure like the emergency system.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Nostalgic fun although your enjoyment on this this might depend on how far you're willing to suspend disbelief,"It's safe to say I think that Home Alone, along with movies like The Goonies and Ghostbusters is going to be on of those for people of a certain generation as a must go to when it comes to sheer nostalgia. It's notable that it catapulted then 10 year old MacCaulay Culkin to international stardom, and brings back fond memories for people like myself who remember going to see it at the cinema as a kid. As it comes that bit closer to hitting the thirty year anniversary of it's release, it's still lost none of it's appeal and has thus far stood the test of time. All this said, and in all fairness I can't say it's a brilliant movie and given it's premise, your enjoyment of it will probably depend on how much you're willing to suspend disbelief. This is after all about a an eight year old named Kevin who's criticised by the fellow childhood members of his family for not being able to pack his own suitcase (their family is travelling to Paris for Xmas) and yet proves remarkably resourceful when fending off the movies antagonists; the burglars Harry and Marv played with hilarious brilliance by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern.Written by John Hughes who sadly passed away several years ago (as incidentally did actor John Heard who plays Kevin's father in the movie), he makes good use of it's basic premise, with young Kevin attempting to temporarily adjust to finding himself on his own and without any parental supervision. Fun moments include him being questioned by a suspicious checkout operator while he's grocery shopping, and tricking Harry and Marv in to thinking his house is still operating by constructing a fake party using cardboard cutouts. It's certainly one of Hughes most inventive movies as a writer, despite how far fetched it is. The now legendary final act is a masterclass of slapstick comedy and you'd be hard pressed not to find yourself rolling on the floor with laughter.Of course with this being a Hughes movie, or just any family comedy of this nature there's going to be some life lessons learned for our plucky young hero by the end of it. Thankfully however it's beautifully handled and while predictably sentimental, it never becomes cringe-inducing. MacCaulay Culkin brings innocent charm to the role of Kevin, and displays natural comic timing. He also handles the transition from obnoxious brat to lovable sympathetic young scamp effectively well. The rest of the supporting cast which includes Catherine O'Hara, the late Roberts Blossom and the late great John Candy (making a relatively brief appearance) are all on top form. No doubt this is a film that will be well remembered for years to come even with it's glaring flaws, you can't deny it's charm and I defy anyone not have a lump in their throat in it's moving final moments.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

an average  conventional comedy,"The first time I saw this film was when I was a child and it pleased me a lot because I only saw its comic side. I saw it recently and it disappointed me although the story is original: during Christmas holidays, the McCallister family decided to celebrate Christmas at Paris, unfortunately they forgot one of their children. First of all, Kevin is elated but he realizes that two thieves want to burgle his house. In order to get rid of them, he puts in several traps; the thieves are under arrested and Kevin finds again his family. If I had to choose one adjective to judge this film, it would be the term: conventional. Several sides of the film are showing it. For example, Kevin's family seem to ignore and despise him and consequently he feels rejected and outraged and ,at the end, his family and especially his mother discovers how much she loves him, moreover, they say that Kevin's neighbour is a killer and he's got a wicked reputation but Kevin finds out that he's not a murderer and he had an unhappy life. Not only is the film conventional but the screenplay is sometimes predictable : when Kevin finds out that is ""home alone"" he wants to have fun as much as he can, and finer feelings are often put forward . Nevertheless, Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci, the two thieves are very entertaining and the sequence where they have to endure Kevin's traps is very funny. At last, I think that this film was especially made for children and young teenagers and it was useless to make it follow by two poor sequels.",,Anonymous,Comedy

Christmas fun for the whole family!,"This is one of the most popular Christmas movies ever. Name me at least one person who doesn't even know about Home alone, let alone haven't seen it. This movie is just fun. It's about Kevin McAllister (Maculay Culkin) who isn't exactly an angel in his family, a lot of relatives think that he's naughty, messing around during dinner time and getting time outs. But on the day his family leaves to their Paris vacation, they accidentally leave Kevin Home alone (hence the name) and he can finally do what he wants. But they are also Marv and Harry, burglars who enjoy stealing stuff on holidays. At this point, Kevin has to face his fears and protect his home. The traps that the little boy created are funny. My favorite scene is the ""Angels with filthy souls"" one. Where he pranked the pizza delivery guy and Marv with Harry by using an old 30-40s gangster movie audio where a man tells if they don't leave he will shoot on a count of 3. That was so hillarious! The acting is great from everyone, not just Culkin, but also Joe Pesci (Harry), Catherine O'Hara (Mrs McAllister), Daniel Stern (Marv), Devin Ratray (Buzz) and others. Also I like that mysterious old man named Marley who is rumoured to have lots of crimes in his hands according to the older brother Buzz, but he's just a lonely neighbour and not a criminal to be scared of.I just love Home alone and it's a perfect choice for a Christmas movie for both children and adults!

To enjoy this movie, it is best if viewers don't over-think about what happened and just sit back and take in Kevin's crazy antics.I admit that I began getting bored when it was the climax of the film. I felt like the humor was very cheap and it wasn't at all engaging. I did however like the message and the heartwarming feeling that I felt during the ending.For me, this was a mediocre film.

Home Alone Movie Review by Mark Boardman (MarkMeets.com),"When it comes to Christmas classics, Home Alone is an undeniable fan favorite that has managed to entertain audiences across generations since its release in 1990. Directed by Chris Columbus and written by John Hughes, the film stars Macaulay Culkin as Kevin McCallister, an 8-year-old boy who is accidentally left behind when his family goes on vacation. What ensues is a hilarious, action-packed adventure that has cemented Home Alone as a holiday staple. But does it still hold up more than three decades later? Let's take a closer look.A Heartwarming and Hilarious PlotHome Alone starts off with a chaotic family scene that leads to Kevin being left behind in the McCallister's lavish Chicago home. At first, Kevin enjoys the freedom of being alone, indulging in junk food, staying up late, and watching his favorite films. But his newfound independence is short-lived when two burglars, Harry and Marv (played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern), plot to rob the house. Kevin, with a combination of cunning and childlike innocence, sets up a series of ingenious traps to defend his home.The concept itself isn't anything groundbreaking. We've seen kids protect their homes from intruders before, but it's the way Home Alone executes this premise that makes it so memorable. Kevin's resourcefulness and creativity, combined with the slapstick humor of the burglars getting repeatedly outsmarted, create a perfect blend of heartwarming moments and side-splitting laughter. The film is much more than a simple comedy - it's about family, resilience, and the joy of finding one's strength even in the most bizarre of circumstances.Macaulay Culkin's Star TurnCulkin's portrayal of Kevin is truly iconic. His performance balances both the vulnerability and defiance of a young boy who, while scared and lonely at first, rises to the occasion and becomes an unlikely hero. It's a performance that captivates both kids and adults alike, giving Home Alone its unique charm. Culkin's natural comedic timing also adds an extra layer of humor to the film, making Kevin's schemes not only clever but outrageously funny.A Standout CastWhile Culkin is undoubtedly the star of the show, the supporting cast is equally noteworthy. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern play the bumbling burglars Harry and Marv, providing much of the film's physical comedy. Their performances are a masterclass in slapstick humor - even when their characters are being outsmarted and pummeled by Kevin's traps, they remain endearing in their incompetence.Catherine O'Hara, who plays Kevin's mother, also delivers a touching performance. Her frantic journey to get back to her son creates a subplot that adds a layer of emotional depth to the otherwise comedic story. The mix of heart and humor makes the film accessible to a wide audience and reinforces its timeless appeal.Timeless and NostalgicEven though Home Alone is set in the early '90s, its nostalgic charm and timeless themes have kept it relevant for today's audience. The story may be simple, but it's universally relatable - who wouldn't love the idea of being left alone in a giant house with no rules, or the notion of outsmarting a pair of burglars? The laughs are still as genuine, and the heartwarming moments are just as impactful.ConclusionHome Alone has rightfully earned its place as a holiday classic. Its clever plot, unforgettable performances, and perfect balance of comedy and heart make it a must-watch every holiday season. If you haven't seen it in a while, give it another watch - it's the kind of film that never gets old. Whether you're watching it for the first time or revisiting it after years, Home Alone will always deliver the laughs and feel-good moments that make it a cherished part of holiday traditions.Rating: 9/10Mark Boardman

A funny Christmas film the first one or two viewsings,"""Home Alone"" was a big hit in the theaters during the 1990 holiday season, and it remains a good comedy to watch over Christmas. But, unlike some other less silly Christmas time films, this is not a movie that stays funny with repeated viewings. After two or three years of holiday watching the film is worth an occasional smile, but it loses much of the fun and laughter the first time that grownups watch it. And, strangely, three decades after this movie appeared when kids got a kick out of it, many youths into the 21st century don't find it nearly as funny.One wonders if all the arcade machines and online and digital video games haven't deluged and numbed the senses of many young people. So much so, that plain antics and slapstick no longer seem funny to them.Anyway, with all the antics, mishaps, traps, and shenanigans that Macaulay Culkin's Kevin pulls off against the burglars who break into his home, this is a funny and fun film to watch. Play or watch it with kids and adults who haven't seen it before, but don't make it an annual viewing around the holidays.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Nice Christmas movie,"In my opinion, this is a great movie to watch with your family on New Year's holidays. It conveys the whole atmosphere and improves the mood. I often revisit it to laugh like when I first watched this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The absolute Christmas movie,"The plot is fairly simple but provides a great foundation for an adventure full of laughs. Macaulay Culkin shines as brightly as it gets and is the main reason for the movie's success, while the duo of Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern add the right amount of goofiness and showcase incredible chemistry. Excellent score by John Williams as well.However, specifics don't matter that much. The major achievement of this movie is that it perfectly captures the Christmas spirit, it's hard to imagine Christmas without Home Alone, watching it has become sort of a family tradition for me - and I know I'm not the only one. It's quite possibly the only movie I've watched so many times, yet it never gets old.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

where Hughes went wrong,"Too bad for John Hughes, my favorite writer of the 80s.  His first offering of the 90s was this blockbuster, not a bad film, but one that started him on an unfortunate trend.  The storyline is ingenuis if you're trying to lure kids to see it, and releasing it during the holiday season made it an easy option for parents who wanted something PG rated for the little ones.  It concerns Culkin being left behind by his family during a mad dash to the airport.  When he awakens to an empty house, he stays unrealisticly calm. Most kids would probably be scared on their own, but he's unphased and makes the best of it, eating junk, jumping on his folks bed and staying up late watching R rated films.  His family finally notices him missing halfway to Paris and mom O'Hara takes the rest of the films running time to get back to him.  In the middle of living it up, Culkin discovers that a pair of hairbrained burglars plan on robbing his house.  He's ready for them, arming the entire home with an array of painful traps and devices.  Up until this point the film was slightly amusing, as Culkin, though not a great kid actor, was cute to watch go thru his little adventures.  But Hughes, writing genius that he is, waited till the end to hatch his goldmine idea that he knew kids would eat up.  Youngsters,  most of which who don't understand prolonged pain and find it funny, lapped up the cartoonish injuries heaped upon Pesci and Stern.  Watching as an adult, though, it just makes you uncomfortable, watching men scream in pain scene after scene. Hughes tries to cancel out the violence with a sappy happy ending, but it does nothing to erase the damage done by the unpleasantness.  And as said earlier, because of the 800 million dollar success of the film, Hughes would mire himself in a clone mode for the entire decade of the nineties! Constantly remaking this formula with even worse results each time.  It all went to show that even your best success cannot be the best thing for you, and all we can hope is that real John Hughes who we loved in the 80s will come home again.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Troubled young man,"This film starts off well with a relatable young boy Kevin who is picked on by his family and left behind on holiday. His antics at home are funny but it devolves once he has to lay traps for the burglars. Slapstick comedy only works up to a point. Beyond this, it seems more sadistic than funny. Kevin seems like a serial killer in the making.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""This house is so full of people it makes me sick. When I grow up and get married, I'm living alone. Did you hear me?""",This movie is a Christmas classic for sure. I remember watching this as a kid and thinking how awesome it would be to be left alone for a few days... too bad my family never forgot about me. I feel like all the main actors are really good in this and the two robbers still make me laugh after all these years. I also have to credit my love for this film to John Williams and his beautiful score. The only reason I don't give it a 5 because Kevin did get on my nerves with some of the screaming (that's how I know I am getting older).,9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Forget about Kevin,"Everyone knows about Kevin - which makes it even more striking that his parents do not seem to know about him. Or rather have forgotten him ... at home. Because you know, vacation time is way more important than to check if everyone is accounted for. Though to be fair there is a head count, before the journey begins.My main problem with this movie (and even more so with the first sequel): Kevin is not a kid I do root for. Yes the Wet Bandits (or is burglars or something else? I already forgot and I really do not care for their name/title) are way worse - and have an excellent Joe Pesci amongst them (the other Dude also really is 100% commited to the physical comedy if you can call it that) ... but the movie never really clicked with me.So yes my personal score would even be lower than the one I gave, but I realize the cultural impact this has had. Having said that the low score already will disqualify me from most reaction - as in they won't read what I have to say or critisize but will give this an unhelpful rating just because I did not give this a high score.Kevin - a spoiled little kid who for no reason at all is being left home alone - well other than so the movie can happen of course. I am a fan of the Three Stooges, Laurel and Hardy, Charlie Chaplin and so many others. So I do like physical comedy and I acknowledge what the movie is trying to do. Although most of the time it does veer into Looney Tunes territory rather than the names I listed above (just a few, there are many others like Marx Brothers and so forth, but there is not enough space for everyone, so don't feel offended by that).Since the kid is really not likeable (sorry not sorry), him being quite the sadist when it comes to defending his home - not something I condone. Add to that the fact that the circumstances that lead to the ""festival"" of torture and traps at the end are as ridiculous and completely bogus as anyone can imagine (calling for help, trying to find someone who can look after Kevin and so forth) ... I am amazed this was so succesful. Yes Columbus knows how to shoot a movie, but in this case he didn't convince me.There are some nice additions in the cast (like John Candy, even if he literally doesn't do anything at all other than being in the movie) and as I stated above I know those who like this and hopefully see this just as a movie are in the majority. I am happy for anyone who likes or liked this. Didn't do much for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Hilarious movie, but uncomfortable treatment of a child.","Now, don't get me wrong, this movie is a classic for a reason. It's highly entertaining, and Macaulay Culkin does as good an acting job as any child actor can be expected to, especially when he's carrying the whole film.HOWEVER: The treatment of Kevin by his family has not aged well. At the beginning of the film, his parents stand idly by while his uncle, brother and cousins verbally abuse him, angrily calling him a ""little jerk"" and a ""disease"" for doing nothing that was even that bad. This will not sit well with modern audiences, who will rightly say that if someone called their child that, they would bi*chslap them and kick them out of their house. The issue was not even addressed in the movie, the parents did nothing to defend him, and thus verbal abuse of small children was normalized, given that it's such a popular movie. I would otherwise give it ten stars, but this really stuck in my craw.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The magic diapered again,"A late merry Christmas from me, and I hope everyone had a nice Christmas in general. It's time to watch the same 5 movies as always because tradition, but let me be honest, I might skip this one next year.Home Alone is a concept that screams Chris Columbus, since it's an amazing child fantasy. He has always been the master of that, creating the scenarios that speak to an inner child in you, imagining that you, in this case, were home alone owning the house, doing whatever you wanted. But after rewatching it for the millionth time, the magic has worn off, as per usual when it comes to me and Columbus movies. Maybe it's me seeing more and more small things I don't like, and repeatedly seeing them just makes me want to skip to the best parts of the movie. This is still a movie I hold dear but for the future, it can run in the background.Kevin is a young boy in a big family, and after they forget to bring him for the Christmas getaway, he is left home alone. This is nice for Kevin, however some thieves might ruin this Christmas for him.What this movie drives on is its concept. It's the ultimate childhood dream to be left alone and do whatever you wanted to. Chris Columbus captures the childhood wonder and fun perfectly, and Macaulay Culkin´s kids charm carries the vision. Eating whatever you want, seeing whatever you want, fight off bad guys, it's a kid's wish come true. This together with the heart is incredible. The movie has these really heartfelt speeches and conversations and combines it with humor to really make a fully rounded movie.But I must admit, it feels like a slow movie, basically because it's a concept film before a plot one. The movie goes from scenario to scenario without much connection, and the loose storytelling just doesn't speak to me. I don't know what the movie tries to do half the time, and the first half doesn't really connect with the laterThe acting is also a bit all over the place. While the charm of Macaulay Culkin is wonderful in this movie, the over acting doesn't really speak to me, with very repetitive gags like the scream done too many times. The standout here is the acting of Joe Pesci and the comedic timing of Daniel Stern. The later physical comedy and the comedic parring of the two really carries this movie.Course, while I find it fun what Kevin is doing in the first half, I just wait for the house invasion. That is the best part of the movie, proving that physical comedy still is amazing when done to perfection.The score is pretty good, but that's no surprise coming from my favorite composer, John Williams. It is a bit all over the place, but so is the movie. He captures every emotion perfectly here.This is a good movie to me, but a lot of empty calories and just entertainment. It don't do more than that. As per usual when it domes to Chris Columbus movies, the concept, and its elements are childhood perfection and captures the essence of having fun as a kid, but creating a strong story and doing something with the concepts are always lacking. This is a classic, and I'll watch it again no doubt, but maybe from a distance next time.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

It was okay.,"Decided to catch this spontaneously and what can I say? Home Alone delivers an unapologetically humorous script, filled with hilarious and distinctive, albeit occasionally over-the-top, gags. Without a single dull moment, it succeeds in being both amusing and entertaining, securing its status as the ideal lighthearted and joyful Christmas classic.Is it grounded in reality? Probably not. Is the writing exceptional? So-so. Does the acting impress? Mostly. The introduction to the premise tends to linger unnecessarily at times. Cinematography and other technical elements don't particularly stand out, but what sets this movie apart is its arguably unique evolution of the initial premise. Home Alone isn't a film meant for dissection; it's meant for pure enjoyment. It's the kind of film that prompts laughter at Kevin's frantic house antics and amusement at the comically inept criminals. Embracing its own hilarity and absurdity, it offers a delightful viewing experience without the need for taking anything too seriously.In essence, it's a carefree and cheerful Christmas classic, sure to leave you in a brighter mood.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""Maybe the kid will let us in."" .. ""He's a kid. Kids are stupid.""","""Home Alone"", directed by Chris Columbus from a screenplay by '80s golden boy John Hughes, has pleased millions of people, and is a not-unintentional holiday perennial as well, taking place as it does during the Christmas season. It is a film that operates at a level at which any sort of professional criticism is no longer helpful. Youngster is (improbably) left behind after his large family packs up and leaves for the airport to vacation in Paris; he fends off two inept burglars while mom makes her way back home. Macaulay Culkin plays the main character, Kevin, but there really is no character; Culkin succeeds in the role strictly by playing up his inherent precociousness--most often directly to the camera--while we admire his spunk and resourcefulness (both unrealistic for easy laughs). The picture looks immaculate, sparkly and shined to a fare-thee-well. Often times, just the reassurance that what we're watching is a big, expensive bauble made solely for our enjoyment is enough to keep the masses happy. The holiday trimmings trigger nostalgia in adults and joy for children, while the thieves (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, both over-the-top) aren't scary, mean or nasty--just lovable, irascible losers who can't topple our pint-sized hero no matter how hard they try...and oh how the audience wants them to keep trying!

Child Abuse,"This megahit that made Macaulay Culkin a household name--and still causes me to wince when I'm in the presence of gallon paint cans--is a tightly plotted and very funny tribute to upper middle class child abuse. Chris Columbus helms this ruthlessly crafty comedy, and from the moment the house lights go down, it's pedal to the metal.What makes this movie ultimately work is the room-temperature-IQ criminals Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. They're so good you stop listening to the little voice in your head that keeps saying that Culkin's character, Kevin, is the victim of child abuse and neglect.If you don't stop listening to that voice, you'll probably leave the movie with a damp face from laughing so hard and a sour taste in your mouth.Home Alone is a giant, cruel joke. But it is funny. I'd suggest some mouth wash as the end credits are rolling.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"Sometimes funny, but how it turned out to be such an incredibly high grossing film is beyond me","I was a preschooler when this movie came into theatres and turned out to be a massive box office success, but I never saw it in my childhood. I saw a bit of what I guess was the 1992 sequel, ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"", when I was a kid, and was familiar with the ""Screaming Kevin"" doll (a toy which I was never was a big fan of, based on the main character in the first two ""Home Alone"" films, played by Macaulay Culkin), from a very early age. However, believe it or not, it took me a little over eighteen years after the theatrical release of the original ""Home Alone"" for me to get around to seeing it! Yes, this movie is up there on the highest grossing movies of all time lists, but now that I've seen it, I don't know exactly what that was all about.Kevin McCallister is an eight year old boy in Chicago whose family is preparing for their Christmas vacation in France. On the night before the trip, he is picked on by his siblings, and after a dispute with one of them, he is sent to sleep on the third floor, wishing his family would disappear. The next day, the family leaves in a hurry and Kevin is accidentally left behind! He wakes up to find that his family actually has disappeared, and his parents don't realize they've forgotten their son back at home until one point during their flight! At first, Kevin is happy that the family is gone, but eventually finds that being home alone isn't all that easy. While his mother, Kate, tries desperately to get back home as quickly as possible, which doesn't turn out to be easy, Kevin becomes aware of two burglars who intend to rob the McCallister house!For a while, early in the film, I didn't find it very funny at all. Before the trip, there's a joke about armpit shaving (jokes like this, along with some language, are the obvious reasons for the PG rating), and one of the McCallister siblings throws up. I did not care for these, and some of the sibling rivalry and insults I found to be a bit much. For a while after Kevin first finds himself home alone, I found the film rather dull, but fortunately, funnier parts come. There are some humorous moments involving Kevin without his family, such as the character at the store, with the question he asks about a certain toothbrush, and I laughed hard during the scenes where he uses the movie to communicate with people at the door, convincing them there are adults inside (they're probably the funniest parts). The McCallister mother can also be somewhat amusing during her attempts to quickly get back home. Casting comedienne Catherine O'Hara in this role definitely helped. The climax can be funny, but gets a little tiresome.I've definitely seen much worse comedies than this hit holiday film from 1990, and this one is funnier than 1994's ""The Santa Clause"", another PG rated family Christmas movie from the 90's, which I seemed to enjoy as a kid, but not during my last viewing many years later. Despite the absurd plot, ""Home Alone"" does have some good humour, as well as a rather poignant moment in the church which eventually comes, but still, the film is not all it's cracked up to be. It may be slightly above average family fare, and it has appeal, but it's still a little strange, the fact it's among the tops in box office history. I'm sure there are so many movies which have been much more deserving of the success that ""Home Alone"" had at the box office, but unfortunately didn't even come close.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
You have to prepare the right energy to get its joy,"At first i just watched for the first time on last month of 2024

I entered with not much expectation

It has a vibe
After 34 years it feels like a window through time

The best Christmas movie...,"""Home Alone"" is a Comedy - Family movie in which we watch an eight-year old child protecting his home from two thieves after finding out he was left alone. His family went to Paris during Christmas vacation and he is home alone.I liked this movie very much and I have watched many times especially during Christmas. It has a simple, nice and very interesting plot that contained plenty of suspense and many comedy moments. The direction which was made by Chris Columbus was amazing and he did an excellent job on the way he presented his main characters along with the plot. The interpretation of Macaulay Culkin who played as Kevin McCallister was simply amazing and he made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Joe Pesci's who played as Harry and Daniel Stern's who played as Marv, and their combination worked very well and had this beautiful result.

A Hughes-Columbus Christmas Classic,"After being accidentally left home alone by his family, Kevin McAllister (Macaulay Culkin) must defend his residence from the Wet Bandits (Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci), who are for some reason obsessed with the idea of hurting the little boy and stealing useless knick-knacks.This film is a legend and a classic. Released in 1990, it captures both the more serious 1990s with the fun 1980s. Two 1980s masters come together to film this one: John Hughes as writer (""Sixteen Candles"", ""Pretty in Pink"", ""The Breakfast Club"") and Chris Columbus as director (""Adventures in Babysitting""). This makes for the perfect blend in young adult situation comedy.This is the film that launched Macaulay Culkin's career. While he had previously appeared in ""Jacob's Ladder"" and ""Uncle Buck"", this was (and remains) his biggest and most cherished role. I would find it safe to say no film since has really captured the essence of Macaulay. While ""Saved"" and ""Party Monster"" are both (possibly) equally as good movies, they do not have the mass appeal of ""Home Alone"".What is best about the film is its sense of fun. The plot really makes little sense. How does a family not notice they have an extra plane ticket or that a sibling is missing? Why would burglars break into a house where they can be identified? How can Joe Pesci get beat up relentlessly and not curse once? Is it possible to not have a single friend, family member or neighbor in all of Chicago? The ""Scream"" joke was used too much (four times). At least one, and probably two, instances could have been removed. Do we need to see a little boy twice getting burned by aftershave? Of course not. The repeated use of the ""keep the change you filthy animal"" joke seemed to work very well, though, strangely enough.Overall, this is a great Christmas movie. Along with ""Die Hard"" this is one you really need to make sure you watch around the holidays, at least once. If you have never seen ""Home Alone"" you are one of five people on earth or something... it was a huge success. With good reason. So see it.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Why Daniel Stern preferred this one to the sequel.,"When I heard Daniel Stern speak at Lewis & Clark College in September, 2004, about his USO tour in Iraq, he said that while ""Home Alone"" had a bunch of silly gags, at least it only had them once; the sequel just repeated everything. When you think about it, that makes sense. This movie was funny the first time (I certainly loved it when I saw it in the theaters), but not much after that.I gotta ask: what happened to John Hughes? In the '80s, he made movies like ""The Breakfast Club"", ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", and ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles""; in the '90s, he got into dropping things on people's heads (think ""Home Alone"" and ""Baby's Day Out""). Oh well, life goes on. And for the record, Daniel Stern also said that when he was in Iraq, some Iraqi children recognized him from this movie; that made him understand the reach of American culture.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Christmas Classic,"It's that time of year again, the time of year when it is acceptable to binge on Christmas films. The first one I watched this year was Home Alone. It is a classic for me, certainly a child hood favourite!The story is a very simple one; Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) is accidentally left at Home over the Christmas as his whole family fly to Paris. They board the plane without realising that they have left one of their Children home alone! Two small time robbers are also in the area, looking to break into houses, they target the McCallister household as they believe they are all away for the Christmas holidays. It is now up to Kevin to protect his house from the burglars by setting up traps and playing pranks, some of which are absolutely brilliant!The two Robbers; Marv & Harry, played by Daniel Stern & Joe Pesci, give fantastic performances. They portray the classic dumb & dumber routine. Harry thinks he is the brains and sees himself as the leader & Marv plays the really stupid, gullible one who falls for much more simple traps. The on screen chemistry between these two and the relationship they have is fantastic, it comes across very realistic and hilarious.Macaulay Culkin was 9 or 10 when Home Alone was filmed and given such a big role with this much screen time must have been a big challenge but he walked it and gave a very convincing performance. The Home Alone films are pretty much all he has been known for, which is a shame really, he had a few other films but none are as well-known and successful as these.Of course this isn't the most realistic films and it does have massive plot holes and ridiculous scenarios, but who cares. It's fun! It's Christmassy & It's got great characters with some truly hilarious moments.Overall, Home Alone is a very fun movie; I have the relation to it as it was always on at Christmas when I was a child. But even if this isn't the case, I'm sure many adults who are new to this will love it just the same as us who have fond memories of watching it as a child!8/10",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Calling this sadistic trash a Family Movie is sick,"Okay, I can understand the basic setting here. A kid is left alone in a big home and gets to do what he wants, and beats up some bad guys though they're twice his size. I admit there's good potential for fantasy and storytelling here.But instead of being clever or funny, the movie is just plain obnoxious and idiotic. The kid is not cute but simply totally irritating. What's worse, most of the supposedly funny scenes in the film are based on him screaming and the burglars getting injured in all possible ways. I have no problem with cartoon violence existing, but this film stretched the limits in a sick and disgusting way. The problem is that Home Alone arrogantly combines cartoon violence with a high level of cinema realism, showing how emotionally detached movies in general have become. People who have no trouble enjoying this are the kind of people who used to get their kicks out of torturing animals or beating up their classmates when they were kids. More disturbingly, the same mentality shows through when footage of actual combat violence in faraway countries is shown in live TV. They're not my race or faith, they're not on my side, so it's not for real, see! Or, they're just criminals, so breaking their balls must be funny, right!

Kids will laugh more than adults will, but I think that's what this film is aiming to do.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Holiday Movie With the Usual Touch of Violence And Christmas Cheer,"This movie is part of our staple of movies to watch at Christmas time. It is a OK movie, with enough holiday themes and scenery to keep me satisfied it is a holiday movie. McCauley Culkin does a good job playing off two bumbling, and really dumb burglars. It helps to have a mansion as the backdrop to foiling Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern.  Some of the scenes where the 2 bumbling burglars try to eneter the house are charmingly funny. It is annoying that the script could not come up more clever ways for Pesci and Stern to react other than ""Ow!' or ""frism-frasm"". And the kid delivers enough hits that would kill a normal person. But today's movies must add violence as one of the ingredients to a successful movie. Audiences have developed a ""taste"" for it, even if this was made to be a holiday movie to be seen by millions of kids. But, I did enjoy the Christmas touches and the various personality conflicts from the large family. Home Alone 2 is the companion movie of part 1 and follows the same pattern.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
one of the best comedy's ever made...,"this movie has to be one of my all-time favorites: Columbus proofed himself as a director in this one, and so did Culkin as an actor. I also liked the performances by Pesci and Stern as the two clumsy robbers. This movie is great from beginning to end and, unfortunately, the last great one from Hughes.         But this movie gets a well deserved 8 (the sequel gets the same rating).",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Fun for the family,"Home alone is a family movie. I played the game on NES and it was discusting. But let's not go into that. This movie was entertaining right from the start, and although I wouldn't laugh at it, it would bring a smile to my face.

Holy Cow! Holy Cow! Holy Cow! Ad Nauseam,"While watching Home Alone it became so plainly obvious (to me) to see just why Macaulay Culkin would never, ever survive his transition from being a child star into anything that even resembled that of a successful actor as an adult. Never. And, it's true. He wouldn't. 'Cause, believe me, he didn't.The writing was so clearly written on the wall for Culkin. And it was quite plainly evident even here in Home Alone. I mean, just like child star Shirley Temple, all of Macaulay's appeal and charm rested solely on the pre-packaged concept of her/him being perceived as that little tyke who was just the sweetest of all the ""cutie-pies"" imaginable.Like, let's face it, it takes real talent (as well as a certain amount of cuteness, of course) to make it as an adult actor. It does. And talent is something that Culkin seemed to possess so very-very little of (and it showed) once he had grown out of that darling, little ""baby"" phase of his.So, unless you're a child, yourself, or an adult who's easily amused by implausible nonsense, then Home Alone's story is just gonna leave you mighty high and dry - 'Cause, hey, other than being completely childish, there sure ain't much joy, merriment, or laughter going on in this one. No way.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy

This movie brings Christmas!,"Home Alone is a familiar movie from childhood. I was surprised how good that still is. I last saw this movie about 15 years ago. Home Alone is still as fun as it was then before unlike some other movies of childhood.

Two other important characters are Harry (Pesci) and Marv (Stern) who are criminals. The are going to rob valuable goods of houses which are empty during Christmas. They don't know Kevin is still at home. Kevin protects home from the burglars while these try to rob his family's house too. Movie contains some emotional moments along comedic scenes.

Now that I'm an adult....,"...I decided to give ""Home Alone"" another look. This used to be one of my favorite movies....when I was about 7 years old. I remember receiving the tape of this movie for Christmas and watching it about 100 times. When you're a kid, a film of this sort is a barrel of laughs. As an adult...it's pretty dull. Not to mention the film hasn't stood the test of time. Macaulay Culkin was an adorable kid, but that's just the point. He was one of those cutesie only-in-the-movies-type kids that got famous for smiling into the camera and belting out semi-witty one-liners. It bothers me every time I watch Culkin's character speak his thoughts out loud, when he's all alone. Having shot a couple student films, that has always been one of my pet peeves. Most non-actors assume that acting is all about talking, and they feel the need to verbalize everything they're feeling, rather than expressing them in facial expressions and body language--like everyday people do! Luckily, Culkin has matured since then, and is now a much better actor. The climax of the movie involving the bumbling burglars still makes me laugh, though, for the most part. It's just weirder now to see the foul-mouthed Joe Pesci in a family film. I still find the interactions between Pesci and Daniel Stern mildly amusing. But all in all, unlike a film like ""A Christmas Story,"" ""Home Alone"" is not a film the adults can enjoy just as much as the kids. I'm sure the kids won't mind Culkin's hammy acting and the constant use of low-brow humor.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A wonderful holiday film by the late John Hughes,"If someone tells you to be careful what you wish for, you better take them seriously. After a tumultuous evening, Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) wishes he didn't have a family. The next day, he gets his wish when, in all the confusion, his family unknowingly leaves for the airport without him. He has the house to himself and enjoys his alone time to the fullest. Meanwhile, Kevin's family is already on the plane trip to Paris, France when they realize Kevin was left behind. As the family tries to get back home as soon as possible, Kevin has to contend with a duo of burglars (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern), defending himself and his house against them while overcoming his fear of his old neighbor Marley, who has been the subject of false rumors.The late movie writer/producer/director John Hughes made many great films, and Home Alone is no exception. Although I consider the Thanksgiving-themed Planes Trains & Automobiles to be the best holiday movie Hughes made, Home Alone is a wonderful Christmas movie.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Nice Movie for the Family,I wouldn't say this is the best movie i ever seen but I must say it is one funny movie. The second one was pretty good as well but the third and fourth ones were just a little kids movies. The first movie of Home Alone I think is the best Home Alone movie and it is exactly what I'll never get sick of it even though I've been watching it over and over again. The funny thing about this movie is that there is so many people in the McCallister family and Kevin is the only one who causes trouble. And when he wakes up the next morning of their vacation in France he finds that his family has left him Home Alone. I really like the two idiots Harry and Marv and they are the guys that makes this movie so good. And of course the guy who people thinks is a shovel slayer and Kevin always screams when he sees him but eventually him and the shovel slayer make friends. I like the part when he has to make a battle plan to defeat the two idiots who were going to break in his house one night and the battle plan music is very good and catchy. I think this movie deserves to be a quite good movie for 1990 and I always thought this movie was made in 2000 because it is so good. This deserves at least a 6.,6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The best family comedy,"This film is gripping and the acting is perfect. Home alone is in my opinion best film at X-mas. I really enjoy watching this film. It´s the best family comedy which I have ever seen. The story is about young boy. His name is Kevin. He is small but he is big trouble-maker. In this film he did a lot of crazy, good and bad things, which you will see when you watch this great film. I think the main character (Kevin) was created for this role! He was really good actor. In this film you can see how Kevin did a traps for two guys, who want to rob his house. It is really entertaining. In film there are some stunts, which are real. There were no stunt-man or stunt-woman. The characters perfomed stunts themselves. That´s crazy! Characters: Kevin are brave, impressive and wily and bandits are thoughtless, bad, sharp. And one interesting thing about this film is that at the end one of the guys tries to bit Kevin to his forefinger and he bit him for real and after shooting Kevin has a real scar. So at the end I must say that it was a great film and you must watch this. Thank you for reading.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The Ideal Holiday Family Movie.,"My Take: Not a holiday classic in the lines of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, but a mild classic all its own.Ever since I watched it since I was a kid until now, that I'm a big movie fan, ""Home Alone"" is still a very hilarious and effective comedy. It may not just be up there among the highest-grossing films of all time, but also among the funniest films ever. It's fast with the laughs, yet still not ignoring the family values, which the film must have. The story is very memorable and fresh, and always worth a look. Little Macaulay Culkin delivers all he can in his performance as Kevin. While Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are fantastically appealing as the two burglars who gets into sticky situations when they underestimate the power of a little eight-year old.For those who haven't watched it yet (which is very doubtful), goo watch it now. For those who've seen it several times (like me), go watch it again, this time, with the entire family. Honestly it doesn't disappoint.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Never Gets Old,"When it comes to enjoying that jolly time of year, there are several movies that must be viewed or else it just isn't Christmas. One of those is 1990's ""Home Alone"". Written and produced by the late, great John Hughes and directed by Chris Columbus, it follows the story of young Kevin McCallister (Played by Macaulay Culkin, arguably the best child actor since Shirley Temple) who's constantly picked on and looked down upon by his large, extended family but especially by his older and much hated brother, Buzz (Devin Ratray in what has to be his best role). On the eve of the big family vacation, Kevin lashes out and gets sent to the attic by his impatient mom (The talented and ravishing Catherine O'Hara) and right then Kevin makes the prophetic wish of never seeing his family again. Little does he know, his wish is about to come true when due to a convenient power outage, his parents' alarm clocks fails to go off and the result is sheer holiday hell as everybody scrambles like there's no tomorrow to catch that flight. Everybody that is, except little Kevin who's forgotten by everyone and as the title says, is left home alone. Shock turns to happiness as Kevin realizes his wish has come true.But it's not all fun and games as two naughty burglars Harry and Marv (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who give a wonderful performance together as the two bumbling thieves) are on the rampage in Kevin's neighborhood. Rather than running away like most kids might do, Kevin decides to fight back using his creativity and some simple but potentially bone shattering traps. It all might sound like a simple holiday comedy to be watched and then put away, but there's something more to the film that keeps me and many others coming back year after year. To be sure, the physical comedy of Harry and Marv getting their asses handed to them by Kevin's traps is nothing short of a laugh riot (Traps include anything from heated door handles to slippery steps).But the film also manages to include a lot of heart as Kevin slowly but surely begins to realize that family is what the holidays are all about and without them it's pretty lonely, a lesson he learns first hand by the at first feared but then loved neighborhood recluse, Old Man Marley (the late, great character actor Robert Blossom). John Williams score to this is undoubtedly one of his best as it is both grand and yet not overbearing in the least. On the contrary, it manages to invoke the spirit of Christmas in all of us while giving us the chills because of its beauty. And of course, who can forget the performance of Macaulay Culkin since the film rests on his shoulders more than anything else. With his mischievous grin and resourcefulness, we just can't help but love his character and root for him all the way through the film. I should also mention that the movie includes a small but very memorable performance by the legendary John Candy (Try not to laugh at the conversation he has with Kevin's mom in the back of the van!). ""Home Alone"" is one of those films that no matter how many times you might see it, it just never gets old. The movie is a time capsule in many ways because it somehow captured not only the holiday spirit but also the magic of the time it was made in, the 90's, a time where not only were the movies better but so was everything else. It is for that reason that movie will live on forever and ever, much like the spirit of Christmas itself. So without further adieu, I urge you to watch this modern classic and if you're ever going on big trip with the family, make sure that you have all your children! Also starring John Heard and a host of other memorable actors. Merry Christmas everyone!!!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A timeless Christmas classic,"Spending Christmas in sunny Australia threw my Christmas spirit array, and I needed something to make it feel more Christmassy. Home alone was the perfect film to do this. Watched by families every year, the film never fails to bring a smile to the face and a Christmas feeling in your heart.Released in 1990, the film is still a classic. However what I hadn't remembered was how slow the film is to get going. The vast majority of the film seems to concentrate on Kevin's adventures in the house but that's not why kids watch it, they want to see the bad guys meet their comic demise. It just felt a little dragged out before the action finally began.Likewise as much of a legend as Macaulay Culkin is, he just wasn't as good as I remembered. When he was trying to act sad, it just felt a bit wooden. He really came to life when he used comedy or was setting up the traps against the bad guys. In comparison to his family though, he was superb. The other group of actors were just slightly too dull for me and I didn't particularly enjoy their scenes.For me the two robbers were the highlight of the film. Two actors have never been picked so perfectly. Their timing, their facial expressions, their tone was just fantastic and even in my 20s, I still laughed out loud at their performances. The film is pretty basic but that's all it needs to be. The stunts are fun and childish and didn't need to use any special effects to make them any better. It's simple but just right.A fantastic film that will never lose its charm, it's a Christmas must-see, every year.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Fantastic Fun-Filled Film,"If you don't like Home Alone then you're either a robot or a zombie. Home Alone was one of the best comedies of 1990.Macauley Culkin plays Kevin McAllister who as the title suggests, is left home alone when his family goes on a trip. At first, he enjoys life as he gets the run of the house but soon starts to miss his family. Then things get worse as two bumbling burglars played by Daniel Sterns and Joe Pesci target his house...Although I was an adult when I watched this film, I could still see why Kevin McAllister appealed to kids around the world. What child hasn't wished they could spend some time alone in their house free to stay up and do what they want? There are some fun scenes throughout especially one when the pizza delivery man comes calling.The burglars are very well played by Daniel Sterns and Joe Pesci (both as clumsy as each other). At first, Kevin fools them making them believe he is not home alone but they soon become wise to his act and break in...that is when the fun starts as Kevin uses dozens of household items to fight them. Everything from irons (which he uses to hit their heads) to christmas decorations with sharp ends which Daniel Sterns steps on.It's hard not to thoroughly enjoy a film like this, especially as it appeals to all of us (adults and children) who have wished we could just have the house to ourself and do what we please.

It is a classic because it has aged well and it's a universally loved family movie set in winter. With that said, It is misleading to call it a Christmas movie. Sure, there is references to the holidays here and there, but does that make it a Christmas film? No, not really.This is an example of how family movies should be made.

A Firm Festive Season Family Favourite.,"'Home Alone' is to this day one of the best feel-good Christmas movies out there. Although the events in the film are highly improbable, the script and the cast make it feel believable - and even possible. The film is well set-up to make the events justifiable.The Big McCallister family is getting ready to go on vacation, when eight-year old Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) causes trouble and is sent to the attic as punishment. Upset with his family, Kevin scolds at his mother, and wishes he never sees his family again.The next day whilst doing a head count, the inquisitive neighbour's boy is mistakenly counted as a family member. In the rush to get ready after over-sleeping, the family forgot about Kevin in the attic. And so they go to Paris without him. When Kevin finally comes out the attic and finds his family gone, he believes his wish has been granted.Relishing in the thought of being alone and being able to do whatever he wants, his joy soon turns to survival instinct when the notorious Wet Bandits (played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) target the McCallister home. So Kevin improvises ways to keep them at bay, and is ready for action when they finally enter his home.Meanwhile, Kevin's mother is trying to make her way back home to get to Kevin. And then there's also the story of their mysterious neighbour, Marley (Roberts Blossom), who is rumoured to be a serial killer.Young Macaulay Culkin carries the film with ease, in a role that propelled him to super stardom. Let's face it, I believe this film would never have been so successful without him. (The sequels proves my point - not 'Home Alone 2', off course, which once again stars Macaulay and was also a box office success).The the events in the film are funny, but the final act is mostly slapstick, yet - strangely - still a lot of fun (I generally hate slapstick!). In general, 'Home Alone' is a film that has stood the test of time, and is still a Festive Season favourite.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Best Family/Christmas Themed Movie,"I loved this movie ever since I was a child. I watched it so many times, the cover of our VHS was hanging together by a thread. 25 years later, my children enjoy this movie as much as I did. I would definitely recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A charming classic for the holidays,"Home Alone is a heartwarming and lighthearted family film that has earned its place as a holiday classic. The story of Kevin McCallister, a young boy accidentally left behind during Christmas, is full of fun and memorable moments. Macaulay Culkin delivers an iconic performance, perfectly balancing the character's mischievous antics with his vulnerability.What makes the film truly special is its mix of slapstick comedy and heartfelt moments. The traps Kevin sets for the bumbling burglars are hilarious and creative, while the subplot of him learning to appreciate his family adds depth to the story.While it's not the most complex or groundbreaking movie, it's an enjoyable and entertaining watch that's perfect for the holiday season.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
SAW: The Beginning,"Just kidding haha... but it's what's been memed to death over and over again regarding this colossus of the Christmas season, Home Alone. A movie so universally loved that it even has some conspiracy theories behind it (Elvis is still alive and works as an extra in the movie!?), and it is not hard to wonder why it is such a success, it is written by perhaps one of the greatest people to understand how young people are, and that is John Hughes.In Home Alone we follow the story of Kevin the youngest in a family of 7 (plus cousins and whatever) who is the one that gets the shaft every single time (his siblings and cousins constantly mock him for being so young). An evening when the whole whole WHOLE family is gathered before a trip to Paris in the morning Kevin gets into a big fight that makes him get mad at his family wishing that they never appear in his life again. Morning comes and the family forgets about Kevin and go to Paris. The rest you probably know.Let's get this out of the way, Home Alone is amazing. Despite all of its plot holes it still works very well as a Christmas movie and as a great movie overall. It makes me wish that we were still in the 90s when people dared to write original movies and concepts, don't get me wrong there are new and original movies right now but not in the same vein as Home Alone and other franchises back then. It has the perfect sheer sheen of nostalgia all around it, it's filmed in a very effective and great way and it has great practical effects.The music is also legendary with a score that is so iconic that you can't even imagine the movie without it.Same thing with the acting in this movie it's pretty great for a movie like this, everyone knows what type of movie it is and give their most fun and heartfelt performance. It feels honestly like they had so much fun filming this movie!Negatives, it feels kinda obvious but there are so many times Kevin could've just gone to the police and stay at the police station or something. The whole plot device of the phone lines not working just doesn't hold a lot of water (especially when later in the movie there are phones working as if by magic). Also there's so many times could've seen where their kid is (I have a hard time believing that they didn't see Kevin going out of the car to the airport, being in a hurry or not). I could go on for ages on how they could've just done stuff much simpler but that kind of ruins the magic of the movie so I choose not to think about these too much. I wouldn't have forgiven these if there were errors like these in any other movie but due to the fact that this movie is fun and great makes it still work and hold together despite its errors and that's a testament to how good it is.Do I have to say more? If you haven't seen Home Alone then please do it, and if you have kids even better- they deserve to see something fun! I'll always remember the magic of seeing this for the first time in my life. Something that I revisit every single year.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Straining for our fondness and doing its best to try our patience on occasion, the film remains snappy and often funny enough in spite of its shortcomings.","I didn't think George Romero's 1985 film Day of the Dead was the piece I was going to come away from Home Alone thinking about the most. Certainly, in terms of structure, there is that overriding sense of the first two thirds of the film acting as gentle 'filler' to the bigger picture; pleasant foundations easing into a final act arriving with such an explosion that when we watch it all unfold, we observe just how much craft and panache has been put towards it when placed up against mostly everything that preceded it. The respective sequences are, of course, when the undead run amok in what was up to that point a safe haven for the few remaining human beings left in the United States and that moment those two burglars in Chris Columbus' 1990 comedy Home Alone make it to the lead's house so as to ransack it.Up to these respective points, we could be forgiven for misplacing that said films were necessarily either respective horror or comedy movies at all. In the case of the Romero movie, that was OK: we enjoyed the clash between those indebted to science and those not; between those with trying to learn and understanding beings initially alien to them and those wanting to round them all up and get rid of them as soon as possible. In comparison, the build up to Columbus' explosion of style, craft and third act circumstance into which you genuinely feel the most energy has been pumped contains a scene in which one of those typically overweight American police officers goofily slips on a stretch of ice as he chases after an infant accused of stealing a toothbrush. Ho hum.In spite of this, Home Alone is a fairly resounding effort on the whole without really ever creeping above a certain threshold of meagerness. It is a child's film, for sure, and one they'll no doubt enjoy watching as the kid protagonist thwarts an array of grownups in both a physical and authoritarian sense. They'll sympathise with the lead and his marginalisation at the hands of uncles and brothers, and they'll respond to his predicament of actually being away from family members and parents whilst having to get by on one's own as the first and foremost source of adventure. Remarkably, the film works as well as it does from an adult perspective; child orientated goals aside, it is made with the best of intentions and competently enough in spite of the fact one can only hold a certain amount of sympathy for a young child wanting all the attention without getting it whilst disparagingly privy to a three storey house in a part of the world which always sees snow at Christmas time and with a family capable of affording expensive holidays to far off locales.It is Macaulay Culkin playing Kevin McCallister, an infant boy stuck at home at Christmas time with his extended family on the eve of their big holiday away to Paris. Kevin is an outcast, and both frustrates and is frustrated by them. One line, as he stamps up and down on the landing, as he shouts: ""When I grow up and get married, I'll finally be able to live alone!"" captures his forthright but ignorant stance. After wishing them gone and he alone, the following morning sees a mad dash and a miscount resulting in the McCallister's halfway over the Atlantic and Kevin still in an attic convert. Cue a lot of shenanigans; a rush to get home to him and a passable framework to do with the lead's realising family are actually something to cherish. Proper antagonism arrives in the form of two burglars, Marv (Stern) and Harry (Pesci); a couple of crooks whose trademark is to fill the sinks of their victims and leave the taps on to induce flooding – rather humorously, they scope out neighbourhoods in a van kitted out to look like a plumbing company and as they 'toast' crowbars whilst spying the McCallister residence, an amusing cut to inside Kevin's house sees a TV cartoon broadcast depicting The Grinch: they are indeed out to wreck Christmas.The various strands and subplots just about hang together; Kevin's mother's sub-Planes, Trains & Automobiles trek back home, complete with an eccentric John Candy figure, is kicked around for laughs but just feels like John Hughes paying homage to himself, while Kevin's integration with a road sweep, whose psychosis ends up being a lot more balanced than was initially established, allows Kevin to see things through more grounded eyes. The road-sweep and our lead share a scene in a church which, quite literally, sees the conclusion of Kevin's framework all but verbally confirmed whilst revealing what it is he's come to learn during this experience - the following fifteen minutes a part of the final twenty seeing the film make that aforementioned step up into a final act of second unit genre onslaught when Marv and Harry finally try to rob the McCallister house. Where the narrative is weak with the whole exercise sporadically feeling spineless, its lead carries the film in a surprisingly diligent manner whereas composer Williams finds a delicate place in between unnerving, on account of some theremin riffs during the opening as a small home is dwarfed by the film's ominous ""Home Alone"" title card, to reassuring and quite pleasant with a thoroughly competent score. Columbus keeps the thing cracking along at a brisk old rate, and while the wheels threaten to come off, it is actually somewhat of a relief overall that they do not.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Cute movie, good for kids, somewhat entertaining for adults.","""Home Alone"" is a very enjoyable semi-classic film. It's about as good as a movie about a kid being left at home and terrorized by burglars could be.McCully Culkin plays Kevin McCallister, the youngest in a family of many children. He is picked on by the older ones and a slip of the tongue gets him in trouble. After a power shortage and a rush to the airport, he is left home alone. To make matters worse, Marv (Joe Pesci) and Harry (Daniel Stern), two police officer burglars, are trying to break into Kevin's house while the family's away. This is a really fun movie. The acting is all around good from paranoid mother Catherine O'Hara to Johny Candy. The situations Kevin is put through are unrealistic, but who really cares, they're funny and clever. McCully Culkin is really good in this actually, considering for much of the film it's a one man show. With the good comes the bad...this movie can get annoying at times. His nonstop screaming in the film gets old, as does his constant looking and talking to the camera. But nonetheless, this is still a fun movie for kids, and pretty painless for adults.My rating: *** out of ****. 100 mins. PG for language and mild violence.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A John Hughes classic!,"Home Alone is renowned as one of the best movies John Hughes has ever written/produced, alongside The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and many others. And I couldn't agree more with that!The movie centers on 8-year-old Kevin McCallister (played by Macaulay Culkin), who lives in Chicago. Kevin's massive family is planning a family trip to Paris for Christmas. Unfortunately, Kevin feels ignored and unloved by his family. And the night before the plane ride, after ruining dinner when his mean older brother, Buzz (Devin Ratray), goads Kevin into a fight by eating a cheese pizza reserved for him, and Kevin ends up being exiled to the attic by his mom, Kate (Catherine O'Hara), while Buzz gets off scot-free, an indignant Kevin hopes that he never sees his family again. Sure enough, that night, a winter storm sweeps the neighborhood, knocking out the McCallisters' power, and resetting the alarm clocks. The next morning, this leads to the McCallisters rushing chaotically to get ready, and in the ruckus, Kevin is left at home by mistake. Kevin believes that he made his family disappear, and enjoys himself at first, but begins to miss his family. To make matters worse, two burglars, Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern), the ""Wet Bandits"", are scheming to rob the McCallister residence. So, while Kate frantically struggles to book the family a flight home, Kevin must defend his home from Harry and Marv's burglary.All the characters are brilliantly written! Our hero, Kevin, is a very likable and relatable protagonist. I mean, right from the pizza scene, he lets us know how it feels to be ignored and unloved by family. Harry and Marv are great comedic villains! As for Old Man Marley (Roberts Blossom), the old man about who Buzz lied to Kevin, saying he was a murderer, (possible spoiler) when he finally speaks to Kevin, he's revealed to really be a kind-hearted old man, and a really good example of ""Don't judge a book by its cover."" (end possible spoiler) The only two unlikeable characters in the movie are Buzz and Kevin's rude uncle Frank (Gerry Bamman), who are both jerks. Although, Uncle Frank does get one of the best lines in the movie: ""LOOK WHATCHA DID, YA LITTLE JERK!!!"" HA!The acting is tremendous. Macaulay Culkin is especially charming as Kevin. Nine years old, and already a real talent! Catherine O'Hara and John Heard (may he rest in peace) are praiseworthy as Kate and Kevin's father, Peter, respectively. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are hilarious as Harry and Marv!Speaking of, the movie is packed from start to finish with delicious comedy! Those include Kevin watching a fake gangster movie called Angels With Filthy Souls (""Keep the change, ya filthy animal!"") and later using that to trick the pizza boy, or burning himself with aftershave TWICE. But the comic highlight of this movie is the booby traps that Kevin puts Harry and Marv through when they try to rob his house! From the paint cans to the face, to Harry literally STANDING THERE as a blowtorch burns his head, to Marv letting out a PRICELESS scream when Kevin puts Buzz's tarantula on his face... you name it! This movie's humor knows no boundaries! But of course, it's John Hughes, what did we expect? The movie, of course, is also heartwarming at times, like when Old Man Marley's true self is revealed, and of course, the ending.And, finally, the music! John Williams, the genius behind the scores of almost all of Steven Spielberg's movies, delivered a truly GORGEOUS score for this movie, special mention going to his mystical main theme. And don't get me started on the beautiful song that he composed, ""Somewhere in my Memory."" I actually sang along to that as I was watching this movie tonight.All in all, Home Alone is one of the greatest movies John Hughes has ever made, and in my opinion, a must-see for anybody who loves comedy movies like me. Especially at Christmastime!!!Oh, and by the way... ""KEVIN!!!! WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY ROOM?!?!?!?!""",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Love Daniel stern!,"Oh, come on, IMDb users. How could this film get only a 6.5? Yes, it's a kid's movie, but I know plenty of adults(not including myself) who loved this film. It touches our hearts, and tickles our funny bones. Not to mention I think in one way or another we could relate to it. That's why it remains a classic Christmas comedy.Home Alone is not only one of the highest box office successes of all time, but it deserves more praise. Mac showed a talent that very little child stars have now-a-days. He brought in a great comedy about a boy who accidentally is left home alone when his family goes on vacation and takes on two burglars.Yeah, it's quit unrealistic about the burglars, but honestly, this is a terrific family film. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are the perfect comedy duo of two idiots who can't rob the place because a 8 year old child has out witted them and set some clever and very funny traps around the house.Please give this movie a chance, it's just terrific and I guarantee nothing but great laughs for you and the whole family.10/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Still bubbling and vivacious,"Hollywood had been yearning for a new child star since at least Ron Howard when prodigy Macaulay Culkin was launched into superstardom through this bubbling and vivacious film by director Chris Colombus and writer/producer John Hughes. In retrospect, it's difficult not to attribute the film's mega-success to several factors clicking into place at once: One is the clever concept of abandonment of a child, which is every child's combined fear and dream as well as every parent's nightmare. The basic concept was easily identifiable for all members of the family. Another is the film's not insignificant mean-streak; there's a sweet guilty pleasure watching our little hero sticking it to the bad guys. The mind-over-muscle showdown reciprocates Hughes' earlier works, only here it's executed by a kid rather than the nerd or outcast. The satisfaction is largely the same. And the third (and perhaps most important) point is young Culkin's charm and star-power. He didn't have the naturalness of Ricky Schroder or the depth of Elijah Wood, but he had the confidence and force to carry the film seemingly indefatigably on his shoulders. No wonder everyone - both young and old - fell in love with him.Home Alone still retains its effect today because its best qualities are largely timeless. That goes for John Williams' score, it goes for the well-balanced level of sentimentality, and it goes for the Christmas theme. In addition to that, the film had the perfect combination of warmth and spite (which unfortunately went askew in the follow-up film Home Alone 2: Lost in New York). If ever there was a modern day It's a Wonderful Life, this is it.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Different Time,"It's now been 30+ years since this iconic holiday movie came out. And at the time, I was too old to care about the zeitgeist films of that era. I was too busy watching ""GoodFellas"" and this film felt like it was too corny for high school me. More peculiar that this also had Joe Pesci playing an entirely different character that his ruthless mob guy. Still unhinged, but much more cartoonish. It was also because John Hughes always rubbed me the wrong way. Sure, this is a Chris Columbus flick, but this stuff stinks of Hughes. John Candy's cameo is an obvious sore to pad out a barely workable premise. HOWEVER, this gave the world Macauley Culkin. A boy so embraced by the public for his precociousness he re-made what a child actor could be.As for the movie, it's is actually well constructed. To a point. I appreciated that they covered most of the bases when it comes to why someone could be left behind and forgotten. That was visually explained well. But, you need to suspend a few things. As it is a live action cartoon, the behavior of some of these people are beyond anything you'd see in today. Everyone today is subdued and mumbly. Here, I'm sure John Heard and Catherine O'Hara screaming their lines or mugging for camera was seen as ""oh well, no one will ever see this movie"". Yet everyone did. And both disappeared into some obscurity. Unless you are an SCTV fan. Canadian humor is like the country, very White and bland. So, take it for what it is.Mac is left alone of Christmas Eve and burglars want the rich stuff in his house. There is nothing specific as to what they want. It's just rich stuff. But are thwarted by Mac and his boobie traps. Fun stuff.I did find myself laughing out loud simply for the idiotic contraptions. Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci are the highlights, without a doubt. So enjoy it for that.They do try to shoehorn a story of Old Man Marley as if he is a spiritual being wanting to imbue wisdom. Hit or miss. The resolution ends too perfectly. Which is fine for this tale.All in all, a fun watch WITH an audience. It's not that great alone.This is miles ahead of any Marvel movie. This tapped into the most fundamental idea of storytelling. Simple without all the computer graphic nonsense.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"30 years later, it still remains a Christmas classic","I honestly cannot believe it has been 30 years since Home Alone came out and still to this day I love watching it.Home Alone follow Kevin McCallister, an 8 year old kid, who accidentally gets left home alone by his family as they go on a trip to Paris. Whilst being home alone, Kevin has to protect his home from a pair of burglars named Harry and Marv.This is a very special film to me and most likely to a lot of people. I remember watching this in school and at home all the time as a child. It's one of those films that I could watch on loop without ever getting bored and it's one of my favourites to watch during the Christmas season.The script by John Hughes is as hilarious as it is heartwarming. There is so much fun to be had with a concept like this and, sure enough, it's hilarious but Hughes balances out the humour with scenes that warm your heart as we see Kevin's character develop when he begins to understand the importance of family. To be fair, you do have to suspend your disbelief with the cartoonish violence and corny nature of the film but those aspects don't really bother me because of the amount of fun I have watching Home Alone.It's not an easy job to carry a film especially for a child but Macaulay Culkin manages it with ease. He makes Kevin so likeable and we root for him the entire time. It's a great child performance. The best part of the film are the burglars played exceptionally well by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. These two make this film a laugh riot and their chemistry with one another is simply magical. Pesci and Stern are so entertaining to watch that there's no way I'll ever forget their characters.I don't think I'll ever forget Home Alone.

My generation's It's a Wonderful Life,"Up until my most recent viewing, despite my immense love for Home Alone, I didn't like the first act, due to how awful the family is to the main character, especially the mom. However, I now appreciate what they were going for with this opening. It's the holidays in a big house, tensions and tempers run high, and people are bound to say things they don't mean and end up regretting. Plus, it ties perfectly into the arcs Kevin and his mom go through: he learns responsibility and the value of family and she goes through a lot of headaches to rectify her mistakes. It's surprisingly kind of deep, especially given how goofy and cartoony the rest of the film is. But, that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Most of the film is every child's dream come true: being all alone without adults to stop you from doing what you want. And it takes full advantage of that through its various funny set pieces, despite how impractical a lot of them may be.The cast does a really solid job with the material, giving the perfect blend of over the top goofy and genuinely good acting. Macaulay Culkin is one of those child stars that may not have been a great actor, but had charm and likeability to spare. This is easily his best performance: precocious and sometimes bratty, but with a good heart, a good sense of comic timing, and plenty of energy. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are both hilarious as the bandits, with solid chemistry with each other, and fantastic pain filled reactions to the booby traps Kevin sets for them. Roberts Blossom is great as Kevin's creepy neighbor. And the family, despite their faults, have their funny moments and a decent amount of personality themselves.John Hughes' excellent screenplay is matched by Chris Columbus' fantastic direction. Every scene truly feels like we're in the middle of winter and close to Christmas, with lots of heavy snow and beautiful decorations and lights (both of which play a part in the climax). Kevin's house is a gorgeous set inside and out; is it any surprise there's a Lego set of it? The finale with the booby traps is the comic high point of the film. The various ways that pain is inflicted on the villains are as creative as they are hysterical. I die laughing every time I watch that sequence. And John Williams' spectacular score, a mix of Christmas carols and beautiful original tracks, including a great theme song, ties it all together.Overall, I absolutely adore Home Alone. In terms of my favorite Christmas movies, it's right at the top, unless you consider Die Hard a Christmas movie (I don't). I watch it every year without fail, and no movie about this season is more guaranteed to put me in a consistently good mood.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"""Keep the change, ya filthy animal!""","A Christmas classic that the younger kids should enjoy more than the rating I have given this film. The McAllister family is on a massive trip to France for the holidays. Thing is when the day comes and a head count is done young Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) is forgotten about.

They try to get into the McAllister home to rob it while they are away on vacation. Kevin though, has some ideas and traps of his own to deal with this pair. Pesci and Stern work great together and they really add a lot of humour and comic soul to the film.

Classic movie,"Home alone is a classic comedy and adventure movie which was made in 1990. It stars Macaulay Culkin (Kevin), who played Kevin. The movie does a great job showing some themes like broken family. Kevin is left alone by himself not on purpose, but he has to take responsibility. He is brave and doesn't fear anyone. Also, the movie raises a variety of scary moments. Strange noises play an important role, those normally scare children, but for Kevin it didn't scare him, when the bad guys were trying to kidnap him. He set traps for them meaning he was not scared of anyone. His ingenuity, approach to problems, kept the movie entertaining, and always kept me to my seat, wondering what would happen next. I would rate this a 4 out of 5, this is one of my favorite movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Great movie, but kind of stupid if you watch as an adult","Very enjoyable movie that plays on every kid's worst fears of getting robbed, especially while you're at home. The real truth is, most robbers will usually run if they see anyone is home. It's not worth the kidnapping and murder charges carrying out the robbery. Also, in a neighborhood like this, someone is most certainly going to be nosy and call the cops if they see anything unusual happen.I used to think Kevin defending his home as a kid was a matter of life or death. In truth, I didn't realize how much money his mom was paying for that trip. Flying a group of family members to Paris, four in first class at early nineties prices is a ton of cash, plus hotel rooms and excursions. Someone like that would probably use robbery as an excuse to renovate their mansion.Factoring in how expensive it would have been to fix the house, some estimates put it at $220K, Kevin probably would have been better off opening the door and letting them take what they wanted.But it's a fun movie for kids, so I'll leave it at that.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I blame Chris Columbous, because go watch the first two Harry Potter films and Daniel Radcliff is shockingly horrible at acting it makes you wonder how the hell he even got cast among hundreds of other contestants.And as for the rest of Home Alone, it is a very overrated movie, from the very fake and forced acting (except for Catherine O'Hara and John Candy), the mediocre and by the numbers story, made worse by the overt smarminess and dumb 90s kids movie slapstick, even with some charms here and there, its just dumb and cookie cutter sap.And of course, come to find that all of the stuff that would have elevated this movie mostly all ended up on the cutting room floor or scrapped from a draft of the script. Even when I was 12 and first saw this, I thought it was really mediocre, especially to be considered a modern day Christmas classic that everyone still raves about all the time. More contemporary movies that do deserve to be remembered, and aren't as fake as this sappy s*** are: The Polar Express and A Christmas Story. I would have been a little nicer if it wasn't so propped up on a high pedestal.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Excellent For The Christmas Season, Or Any Season.","Growing up, I used to spend the night with my Grandma, who is now my guardian. We would stay up super late watching movies, and most sleepovers would include watching Home Alone before bed. As a result, this may be my most watched live action movie that's not from Disney.Even then, I have seen it a few times since. I eventually got my own VHS tape of it, and last month I watched it on my own DVD. And even at 24 years old, I still love Home Alone.The plot centers on Kevin McCallister, an 8-year-old boy played by Macaulay Culkin. He's a pest to his entire family, who is preparing to go to Paris for Christmas. Through a series of convenient events, everyone leaves for their trip without him. Due to a fight he had with them, Kevin assumes his wish for his family to disappear has come true, and he celebrates.However, jumping on the bed, eating junk food, sledding in the house, and watching violent movies turns into terror when 2 bandits- Harry and Marv (played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern respectively), plan to break into their house, which causes Kevin to plan a trap for the bumbling duo.No matter if you are a child or an adult, Home Alone is a ton of fun. There are also many funny moments and lines. (""When I grow up and get married, I'm living alone!"")As for the moments, while watching Kevin break the rules is entertaining, but the highlight is a 15 minute segment in which Kevin sets traps for the bandits who want his house's valuables.This includes, but is not limited to- slipping on ice and toy cars, stepping on nails and glass ornaments (don't worry, Daniel Stern wore rubber feet for that part), and setting Harry's head on fire.When Home Alone released 32 years ago, Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel both disliked the movie, mainly for this portion, finding people getting hurt like this to not be funny.I'll admit, now that I'm older, this is more painful than funny to watch, but it is still funny nonetheless. And the reason is quite obvious. If the bandits had done this to Kevin, it would be horrible to do to a child. Here, a child is doing it to a pair of dummies, which makes it hilarious. Therefore, I don't agree with this critique.Home Alone does stretch logic and have a painful climax, but it's hilarious and deserves the classic fame it has gained today. No matter if you are a kid or an adult, Home Alone is excellent entertainment for the Christmas season, or any season.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The script is so compelling with its successful humour and authentic line delivery. One thing that makes this movie so memorable is the outstanding score by John Williams.

Kevin McCallister is Obviously Training Himself to be Jigsaw,"While celebrating the holidays, classic Christmas films are a surefire way to set the mood and make spirits bright. Capturing the holiday cheer, Home Alone has been a definitive film of the season for over 30 years. With Macaulay Culkin taking on his most iconic role as Kevin McCallister, it is undeniable how charming and talented he is, especially for a child actor. Although the story is fun and entertaining, it is Kevin McCallister and the Wet Bandits (Joe Pesci & Daniel Stern) that elevate the film into its iconic level. While most of the film is fun, there are some slower bits in the middle, which separate the fast paced start and the exciting heist. With memorable performances, lots of laughs, and plenty of holiday heart, Home Alone is a fun film that consistently makes spirits bright.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Quite simply one of the greatest family comedies ever made,"Roger Ebert gave ""Home Alone"" a mere 2-1/2 stars, which is the same rating he gave ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"" another one of my childhood favorites. (For comparison, he gave that same rating to mediocre movies like ""Six Days, Seven Nights"" and ""Superman III."") The reasoning he gave for giving ""Home Alone"" that rating was that he liked the first half of the movie, but then didn't like the burglar/booby traps plot in the second half. At first, I was going to say that Roger Ebert has simply lost touch with his inner child, but I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt.I watched ""Home Alone"" today after many years and I still loved it and I still laughed, even though I had practically memorized the movie as a kid and still remembered it all. As a kid, I remember always wanting to get to the ""cool"" stuff when watching this movie, the parts about pulling pranks on the pizza man or booby-trapping the house. I'd fast-forward through much of the first half (even though I liked it). This time around, I had a new-found appreciation for the beginning half, where we get to see how an 8-year-old copes with waking up and discovering that his family has disappeared. I still LOVE the second half of the movie, but I saw the first half in a new light this time.I think the reason why that happened is the same reason why Roger Ebert didn't like the second half of the movie. As an adult, one watches family movies to remember what it was like to be a kid, to remember the dreams of being grown-up and independent and the silly little fears of things in the basement. That's what the first half of the movie offers and it works for both kids and adults; kids relate to it and adults reminisce about it.The second half is for the kids (and for the inner child). Sure, it's pretty outrageous to see an 8-year-old devise clever booby-traps that work like clockwork and are encountered in precisely the right order. Ebert says that our little hero gets too smart and doesn't have the budget for his fancy booby-trapping. Maybe, but that's not the point. Adults watch and say, ""Man, this can never happen."" But kids say, ""Man! I wish I could do that!"" It is, after all, one reason why we go to the movies: to see things that can only happen in the movies. As a kid, words could not describe how awesome it was to see an 8-year-old take on two adult burglars and pummel them (especially after one of the burglars had the nerve to say, ""Kids are stupid""). It is a child's fantasy come true.That is why this movie was so popular when it came out, why it stayed #1 at the box office for 12 straight weeks. It's also why every family movie from the 1990's tried (and failed) to imitate it. Kids love it because it's a dream come true and parents love it because it's a dream remembered.(By the way, parents, I should warn you that kids will want to try and imitate our little hero and, unless you want your house booby-trapped, I'd advise that you let them know not to do that. Also, there's one scene where our hero celebrates his new-found freedom by watching a gangster movie, where he sees one gangster blow another one away with a tommy gun, a scene that scares him and makes him remember his mom. Older kids and adults will laugh at the scene (because it's way over the top), but little kids may actually get scared. Just a caution.)Macauly Culkin is great as our hero, Kevin. He was a pretty talented child star and it's too bad his career never really went anywhere. Our two burglars are Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci, who are the Pinky and The Brain of breaking and entering. I think Stern's character, Marv, was supposed to be the funnier one, but I personally liked Pesci's character, Harry, more. One thing I love is the way he's muttering nonsense under his breath every time he gets caught in a booby-trap, since he can't curse in a family movie. (Actually, true story, he had to do that because he had just finished filming his Oscar-winning and totally awesome role in ""Goodfellas"" as a foul-mouthed, quick-tempered, homicidal maniac of a gangster and so he was quite prone to cursing.)What can I say? I LOVE this movie! It makes me a kid again.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Good movie,"Home Alone is a beloved holiday classic that has earned its place in pop culture, but upon closer viewing, it's not without its flaws. The premise of a young boy left home alone and defending his house from bumbling burglars is undeniably creative, and the film is packed with memorable moments.Macaulay Culkin shines as Kevin McCallister, delivering a charming and confident performance that makes him an easy character to root for. The slapstick humor involving the Wet Bandits (played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) is entertaining, though it sometimes feels overly cartoonish.The movie's strengths lie in its humor, heartwarming family moments, and iconic holiday atmosphere. However, the plot requires significant suspension of disbelief, and some of the humor hasn't aged as well as the nostalgic vibes would suggest. Additionally, the pacing can feel uneven, with a slow buildup to the chaotic and entertaining finale.Despite these shortcomings, Home Alone remains an enjoyable watch during the holiday season. While it may not resonate as strongly with everyone beyond its nostalgic charm, it's still a fun and feel-good movie that has earned its reputation as a holiday favorite.A solid 6/10 for delivering festive fun and laughs, even if it doesn't quite hold up to its legendary status.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A Christmas comedy classic,"When you think about classic Christmas films, 1990's 'Home Alone' is usually sitting near the top of most casual moviegoers' lists. The surprise hit holiday family comedy has earned its place in cinematic history thanks to its originality, memorable dialogue and one-liners and enduring cultural relevance.34 years after its release, the original 'Alone' holds up incredibly well, even after years of rewatches. The dynamic between the McCallister family (namely, Macaulay Culkin's Kevin and everyone else) is something that can't be replicated in any other film, nor can Culkin's delivery in key scenes (see ""aftershave application,"" for example). And then of course there's the brilliant idiocy of Joe Pesci's and Daniel Stern's Harry and Marv, who basically steal the show in its third act.But it's not totally the Culkin show. Catherine O'Hara's masterful portrayal of a panicked mother who is committed to get back to her son at all costs (even if it means hitchhiking with regional polka players) brings a human element to the film. And the unexpected friendship that develops between Kevin and a mysterious elderly man (the late Roberts Blossom) is another heartfelt addition to an otherwise pretty silly story.Chris Columbus and John Hughes delivered in a big way with 'Home Alone' before they had a repeat two years later (in a different city), and their contribution to holiday cinema will be appreciated for generations to come.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"I Hate to be a Grinch, But ...","I saw this movie when it first came out and didn't care for it, but recently, I thought I would give it another chance. I still don't care for it. This is basically a one-joke movie --- i.e., the stupid burglars being defeated by Kevin's numerous booby traps. And to get to that one joke, it takes a series of highly improbable events, from a family not verifying that all their children are accounted for by sight and an actual roll-call, instead of a simple head count, to the police taking lightly a report of an 8-year-old child left home alone. Not to mention the fact that the pizza delivery guy would doubtless have called the police to report that he was shot at - with automatic weapons fire, nonetheless. But, for me, the biggest turnoff was that the entire family - parents, uncle and aunt, and all of the kids, including Kevin - are obnoxious jerks.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Merry Kidsmas,"That cover shot of young McCaulay Culkin's goofy face has put me off watching this festive movie for years but in mid December on a rainy, cold afternoon and having watched most of the best of the Christmas-themed movies around, I turned to this at last. And sure, Culkin gets more screen close-ups than Greta Garbo ever did, either due to the director wishing to emphasise his ""cuteness"" or maybe in some way to cover up his inexperience at acting, but the movie is so fun that you get used to it as it rolls entertainingly along.Seems to me that young Kevin gets the best Christmas present ever when, as he thinks, he makes his horrible family disappear over the holidays, but when house burglar Joe Pesci and his hapless accomplice determine to loot Culkin's parents' house, the fun and games commence as the kid fights back, plus of course there's time for a big dollop of Yuletide sentimentality as the youngster makes friends at last with the sinister-seeming old man next door, sorting out the latter's family problems in the process.The movie's really fun as you warm to the initially brattish Kevin and have to admire his methods of keeping the baddies at bay, firstly with his automated mannequin show and then of course when he seemingly booby-traps the whole house to repel the invaders. Pesci is very good, offering us a family-entertainment version of the psychos he plays for Scorcese, with nary a cuss-word in sight but it's the kid's movie with young McCaulay's acting improving as the movie progresses which almost makes me think the film was shot in chronological order.I have to admit that before watching, I expected this to be an indigestible slice of over- sentimental nonsense, but instead was well-entertained by a clever and funny family feature which rightly deserves its reputation as a latter-day Christmas dare I say classic.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Hilarious Holiday Classic,"""Home alone"" is a 1990 American comedy film directed by Chris Columbus and written and produced by John Hughes. The film stars Macaulay Culkin as Kevin McCallister, a young boy who defends his suburban Chicago home from a home invasion by two burglars after his family accidentally leaves him behind on their Christmas vacation to Paris. The cast also features Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern, John Heard, and Catherine O'Hara.The story follows 8-year-old Kevin, who is accidentally left behind by his family when they go on vacation for Christmas. The creative traps Kevin sets for the two burglars who are trying to break into his house add a very unique and unpredictable twist to the plot. The standout aspect of the plot is the cleverness of Kevin's inventions and the comedic scenes.The performances in ""Home Alone"" are memorable. Macaulay Culkin as Kevin portraits a mix of innocence, creativity and mischief that makes the character relatable to children alike. The burglars, played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, deliver a comedic yet threatening presence. The supporting characters, including Kevins family, add depth to his loneliness and desire for independence.The cinematography captures both the warmth of the McCallister home and the coldness of the outside world. The camera work includes a mix of wide shots and close ups that enhance the storytelling. For example, close ups of Kevins face highlight his emotions, whether he's excited, scared or clever. In the film Columbus effectively balances comedy and emotion, ensuring that the funny moments land well while also allowing for the heartfelt scenes to resonate. Overall, the direction and cinematography work together to create a memorable viewing experience that combines humor with heartfelt moments.The main theme of ""Home Alone"" revolves around family, the importance of togetherness, and the spirit of Christmas. It explores the idea of Kevins independence, as he learns to take care of himself and realizes the value of family. The film also mentions childhood imagination and capableness, as Kevin defends his home all by himself.The film is well-paced, balancing moments of tension with comedic relief. The atmosphere suited the holiday genre perfectly. The festive decorations and music add on to the overall cheerful vibe, making it an enjoyable watch for audiences all ages.In conclusion, ""Home Alone"" is a funny and joyful film that I would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys holiday classics. Personally, I have been watching ""Home Alone"" every Christmas since I was little and it never gets boring. I would give it a rating of 10 out of 10 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Home Alone,"It has taken me 30 years to sit down and watch this film and I'm quite glad I finally did. I usually loathe kids movies, and the trails at the time always put me off - but Macauley Culkin is really quite a charmer in this tale of a youngster who is accidentally left at home at Christmas by his family. They have jetted off to Paris leaving him alone facing the unwanted attentions of two would-be burglars (Joe Pesci & Daniel Stern). Initially a bit unsettled, he is soon is his stride using just about every gadget (and critter) in their large family home to make sure he thwarts their thieving intentions. It's really all about the kid - and this one delivers well. The slapstick elements of the plot are designed to raise a smile, never to maim - even if having your head set on fire by a blow torch, or being walloped in the face by an hot iron might do longer term damage than happens here. That's the fun of it, for fun it is - it's a modern day Laurel & Hardy style story with an ending that's never in doubt. It does have a slightly more serious purpose, highlighting loneliness - not just for ""Kevin"" but his elderly neighbour ""Marley"" (Roberts Blossom) and it has that lovely scene on the aircraft when mother Catherine O'Hara realises that it wasn't just the garage doors that they forgot to sort out before they left! A great, and instantly recognisable score from maestro John Williams tops it all off nicely.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Unfortunately for Kevin, he lives in a rich house, which is targeted by two burglars: Marv and Harry. They plan to rob Kevin's house at 9:00 pm, so Kevin has to protect himself, using self-invented traps.Home Alone is simply full of slapstick humor, with some hidden jokes in between. (One of the funniest parts is the one with the pizza man.) But, John Hughes made one mistake: He forgot to make it realistic. How could Kevin stay asleep, while his whole family is screaming and trying to pack? How could he make so many traps, but not pack a suitcase? How could Marv spend so much time on the floor after tripping, when Harry has grabbed Kevin? How? Well, despite the main flaw, Home Alone makes a fun, heart-warming holiday movie. I would definitely recommend it! Of course, it isn't perfect, but its fun and fun is what holiday movies should be!7/10Good: Fun, funny and heart-warming, and has nothing to do with Santa (like most Christmas movies do)Bad: Unrealistic, and it could be funnierFeel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Holiday slapstick fun,"Ahh, Christmas. An abandoned child brutally assaults, almost murders two nasty burglars and subjects them to all kinds of elaborate slapstick glory. Such is the joy of Chris Columbis's Home Alone, a seminal holiday classic that contains no message, very little arc, and all the booby trapped hilarity that's more demented than my dad's endless cackling when he sees it on TV for the zillionth time. Don't get me wrong: I enjoy the film, and re watch it whenever I get the chance. It's just pretty demented. Macauley Culkin (back when he was a cute kid before he grew up and looked like something that Dr. Frankenstein made using Steve Buscemi's DNA) plays feisty little Kevin, accidentally left behind at home when his massive dysfunctional family heads off for Christmas vacation. Feeling a bit blue after harsh words with several of his clan, he sets out to live life on his own over the break, which includes shoplifting a toothbrush, eating copious amounts of junk food and the classic prank pizza delivery (ya dirty animal). Things get weird when two scruffy, relentlessly dumb burglars (Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci) set their sights on his home. He takes the phrase 'holding down the fort' terrifyingly seriously, and devises a onslaught of evil traps, gags and medieval style defense tricks that would make the Huns proud. Seriously, I wouldn't wish that tarantula misfortune on anybody. Pesci is grinning glee as the smarter of the two (which isn't saying much) and Stern plays up the banter as the colossal idiot. Catherine O Hara and John Heard play his neurotic parents, John Candy has a puzzling cameo as the undisputed polka king of the Midwest, and Roberts Blossom plays a menacing show shoveller who figures in the plot. Quite the holiday romp. I'm not including the sequels in this series, but I will say: the second one is fun, but stales a bit as it's essentially just a retread of this just in NY and wayy more implausible. I really love the third which is probably my favourite of the series (come fight me). Avoid the 4th and 5th like the plague unless you want to see French Stewart and Malcolm McDowell embarrass their careers terrifically.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This is a comedy?,"An 18 year old white Gary Coleman makes lots Jim Carey faces and the ""jokes"" are people getting hit in the head with bricks??!?!!? This movie sucks beyond belief. There are so many actually funny Christmas movies (e.g., A Christmas Story) that no adult should ever watch it.

A Funny and Heartfelt Classic,"Home Alone continues to stand the test of time due to it's ability to captivate the kid in all of us. Whenever I rewatch it, I can't help but imagine ways I can outsmart bad guys by placing traps around my house. But the core of the film comes from the lessons that Kevin, the main character, learns. That family and kindness is some of the most important things. Though it's a simple and possibly cliche lesson, the movie goes about teaching this moral in a powerful and unique way.8/10- Great!",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Nostalgia-proofed holiday classic,"Like many other people of my vintage, HOME ALONE has been a staple of the holidays for as long as I can remember. The story is essentially a kid's fantasy: not just staying home alone and getting to play by one's own rules for a while, but also inflicting comical pain upon very obvious bad guys. The Christmas-y mise en scene and clever use of low camera angles complete this nostalgic, feel-good comedy's sense of festive atmosphere.As an adult, the contrivances that cause the plot to occur are more apparent, of course. And the slapstick climax is shockingly violent-- it never occurred to me just how brain-damaged or DEAD the Wet Bandits would be. However, none of these things bother me in the least. Maybe it's nostalgia. Maybe the movie's strengths are so potent as to cancel anything else out. I don't know. All I know is the movie still makes me laugh in my 20s as much as it did when I was a child.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Hilarious 'feel good' Christmas family film,"A Chicago family go to Paris for Christmas and accidentally leave their youngest son behind to fend for himself against a pair burglars.When I first saw the trailer for Home Alone, I was curious but unwilling to suspend my disbelief of John Hughes' concept enough to watch it in a movie theatre. After renting the video tape, I regretted my earlier decision because I wholeheartedly accepted what happens to Kevin McCallister. This is partly because everything you are shown in the set up to his predicament is wonderfully cinematic, particularly the family dynamics and all the little moments that connect to things that come later.We then witness Kevin's character steamroll his way through an arc, transforming him from a chaotic and sometimes frightened child, through to responsible homemaker, valued confidant and finally to become the king and defender of his castle. Anyone who questions a child actor's ability to carry a film should take note that Macaulay Culkin with a pitch perfect script proved it can be done spectacularly well.The performances of all cast members playing the McCallister family are brilliant, bouncing off each other wonderfully. Memorable cameos come every other scene with the likes of Ralph Foody, John Candy and other supporting characters adding more layers of humour.The other stars of the film are Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern as a criminal incarnation of Laurel and Hardy. They have epic screen chemistry and their slapstick sequences, with the help of some fabulous stunt performers, are what make the film something to be treasured and rewatched.John Williams elevates it further with a classic soundtrack that oozes kinetic mayhem, warmth and Christmas spirit.For those interested in production design, Home Alone is a virtual 'how to guide' for a Christmas themed movie on a low budget. Almost every scene and character is a perfectly coordinated shade of red and green.The ending is a bit overly sentimental for my usual liking, but at Christmas who wants anything other than something to make them laugh and smile.I have gained a greater respect for the cinematic craft on display since finding out it can hold my two year old daughter's attention for the duration.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
He made his family disappear,"I first saw this movie when I took three of my friends to it for my 10th birthday.  I thought it was really funny when the burglars, Marv and Harry fell into every booby trap that Kevin had set up.  Kevin was the youngest kid in his family (not including cousins, aunts, uncles, or grandparents). His older brother Buzz would always pick on him and his Uncle Frank was just a jerk.  That night, Kevin wished for his family to disappear.  By a strange coincidence,or was it just the fact that the family was in a rush and just plain forgot him?, it came true.  Then two burglars come over to rob the place when Kevin sets up his booby traps.  Many of these scenes looked quite painful such as the scene where Kevin shoots Harry in the genitals with a BB gun and when Marv steps on a nail (let's hope he got his tetanus shot).  So for this holiday season, forget about old movies like Bing Crosby's ""White Christmas"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and pop this video into your VCR. You and your whole family will love this film.",,Anonymous,Comedy
WAY too violent.  THIS got by with a PG??????,"A heavily dysfunctional family are going away for the Christmas holidays. They accidentally leave 8 year old Kevin (the annoying Macauley Culkin) alone at home. Other than doing what a normal kid would do (go to a neighbor or call the police) he decides to stay at home all alone. Two burglars (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern--both who deserve better) try to break in. Culkin manages to single-handedly set up elaborate bobby traps to stop them.What a violent sick piece of garbage! I caught this is a theatre back in 1990. I saw it after a long week at work and expected a mindless fun PG movie. I was horrified by what I got. For starters the story was impossible. Leaving behind an 8 year old kid by mistake??? Come on! Also the whole family is heavily dysfunctional and not at all funny. Culkin manages to set up elaborate traps and stuff that no 8 year old could ever do. When Pesci and Stern show up the movie goes from stupid and unbelievable to extremely violent. These poor guys repeatedly get burnt and hit repeatedly on the head and face again and again--and it's all played for laughs! I was sickened by the level of violence in this film. How did this get a PG rating???? Also violence against people is NOT funny. It got to the point that I was rooting for the burglars. Aside from all this it just simply isn't funny. Sick, stupid and unbelievable yes--but NOT funny.The acting is as bad as you'd expect. Culkin is annoying from the start. Not cute at all--you want the little brat to get it badly. Stern and Pesci do what they can with nothing roles. Still, I realize I'm not the audience for this. In the theatre I saw it with was full of families with their kids. During the violence all the adults sat there horrified while all the little kids were screaming (literally) with laughter. A few parents dragged their kids out of there--I wish I had joined them. This was (inexplicably) a huge hit and led to the thankfully brief career of Culkin. Avoid this like the plague and definitely do NOT let small kids see it. A 1.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Home Alone review,"This is the best Christmas film of all time in this writer's opinion. The film undoubtedly has faults like any film and the fundamental basics are at times a little embarrassing as far as acting and continuity are concerned.However this film as good as it is has a personal value to me as a person. I watch this film once every year in the weeks leading up to Christmas because i used to watch it every day of December up to the 25th when i was a child so there may be a considerable amount of bias in this review and for that i apologise.The basic plot is frankly classic and as soon as you see the plot unfolding it is impossible not to be entertained.The over the top acting is at times good and at times bad but it is all tongue in cheek. The two criminals (Joe Pecsi and Daniel Stern) make up for little Macaulay Culkin who is good in his own way i suppose and while not as hilarious as his co stars of previous mention, he does have his moments.Then of course everybody's favourite part of the film, the pranks. Obviously it is why every child of the last 20 years of the existence of our universe loves the film. The fact that an 8 year old child could out wit and over come two adults for such a long period of time simply does not come to mind because how well the events of the film are set up. It seems like in reality this helpless rude and ignorant brat could not make toast for himself but com on...WHO CARES!!??I not to go to much into the story on the off chance that you are reading this without having watched the film. All in all it remains the champion of Christmas film and will most likely never be beaten (although Bad Santa came close as did Jingle all the way - the la-tar for a different reason).perhaps i am being to generous but perhaps not 8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The good old days,The kid in me rates this a 10/10 but the grown up in me rates it a 6/10. So in fairness I balanced it out to 8/10.Without giving too much a way as a kid the highlight of it was obviously Kevin's dealing with the crooks. Stuff like that seems silly to me now. But the movie still has stuff in it grown ups like me can like such as Kevin's friendship with his scary neighbor. It stands out all these years later as the films saving grace to me.,8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Family comedy with a bit of violence,"This is one of the most famous, well-loved Christmas movies. I highly recommend watching this movie in a close circle of friends and family. The main idea which is given in the film is that is never too late to stop being afraid of anything, even if it is a simple fear of spiders or fear of relationships.Kevin, the main character of the movie, has great strength, intelligence and creativity. He is able to protect his house against burglars and leave any fears even though he is only eight. The acting is believable, and I especially imagined myself in the shoes of his mother as she desperately tried to find a way home when all the flights were booked.Kids are quite interested in this movie. I showed it to my kids this year (8 and 11 years old) and they found it hilarious. BTW, there are some scenes in the movie which are not appropriate for children because of the terrific tricks of the child which children would like to copy.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Only in the 90s,"I guess back in 1990, if you left your eight year old son home alone for almost a week, children services wouldn't get involved. My, how times have changed. Now, you leave your kid alone for five minutes and children services and the media grill you on the five o'clock news! However, Home Alone had a good premise I suppose; a boy defending his home against burglars over Christmas break.What could possibly go wrong? Almost everything that could possibly happen, that's what! MacCaulay Culkin plays Kevin McAllister, who gets left home alone. That's when the antics start. Chris Columbus did a great job directing the film from a story by John Hughes.Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern costar as the bad guys who call themselves the 'wet bandits'; a duo who bumble and burglarize. In the end though, good wins out over evil. And Kevin is reuinted with his family.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The fun thing about Christmas is it attracts Wet Bandits (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern.)Now the contest begins between the bandits (in Wile E.

"A Classic, In The Deepest Sense of The Word.","Home Alone is another film that screams the word classic. It's another case of a well known writer and director working together and somehow having it work miraculously well. It certainly doesn't approach Fincher and Sorkin's collaboration on The Social Network. But it's a good film, and a classic in its own right, as mentioned before.John Hughes' script showcases his knack for capturing small, human moments and also shows his uncanny ability to write kids and adolescents, and as gut bustingly funny as this film could be, I found that those small moments were far more touching than I remember it being. The film is also well known for its comedy and one of the most beautifully realized instances of slapstick ever put to film, one that was no doubt inspired by the Looney Tunes and The Three Stooges. Columbus' direction also showcases the touch of a competent and talented director. Much like his mentor Steven Spielberg, he has a unique gift for capturing the wonder and awe of a strange situation, but also showcasing the humor of a situation.The acting in the movie is also surprisingly well handled. Macaulay Culkin is surprisingly charismatic and charming in his role as young Kevin McCallister, capturing a sly cleverness, while also maintaining a childhood innocence. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are also excellent as the comically inept Harry and Marv, who I should again mention remind me of Looney Tune characters like Wile E. Coyote or Sylvester the Cat, two determined, but completely incompetent in their excursions, and much of the film's comedy comes from their antics and the fact that despite their determination, they just aren't good at what they do, and they're outwitted by a young kid who's more competent than they are.In short, it's a Christmas film that still holds up all these years later. It's deeply felt, yet thoroughly entertaining film that captures the spirit of Christmas well, in all of the good tidings and feelings that it brings.Merry (belated) Christmas everyone.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Home Alone,"Home Alone is one of the most iconic Christmas movies of all time. It's one that I heard about every year come holiday season. As such, I'm genuinely quite blown away by the fact that this was my first time seeing it. Certainly, I had seen some snippets here and there and knew what the movie was about, but for the most part, I saw it without knowing what would happen.Since this was the first time for me seeing Home Alone, I'll start by saying that I absolutely adored it. It was tremendously entertaining, funny, and enjoyable. It felt wonderfully Christmasy and captured the essence of the holiday perfectly. While it's easy to focus on the chaotic antics of the third act, I also loved how important family was in this movie. Be it Kevin wishing he had his family back, or his mom doing anything in her power to get back to her son. Or, maybe even the neighbour connecting with his son again. In the midst of all the chaos and comedy, there is also a wonderful and heartwarming message in there. And although I really, really enjoyed all the action, this movie wouldn't be anywhere near as good as it is, if it weren't for that message.The story, which I'm sure everyone is already more than familiar with, leaves us with Kevin, an eight-year-old boy accidentally left behind from the family trip to Paris. While Kevin, who isn't the biggest fan of his family, enjoys the freedom he has, he soon realizes how much he actually misses them. And when a pair of burglars try to take advantage of the parents being gone, Kevin must overcome his fears and defend the house. It's a story that sounds extremely simple on paper. And while for the most part, it is, the way it's crafted, leaves room for countless wonderful and iconic moments. It's genuinely fun to watch Kevin learn about the most ordinary everyday things, like laundry and grocery shopping, and it's equally fun to follow the chaotic journey that the rest of the family has. Once you add the cherry on the top, which is, of course, the third act battle between Kevin and the burglars, what you have, is an immensely entertaining film.What surprised me the most, was how gruesome, and brutal, Kevin's traps were. In fact, the whole battle sequence was much darker than I ever could've expected. However, the way it's handled makes it an enormously funny sequence. Harry and Marv, the burglars, create most of the comedy in Home Alone, and they are fantastic. They provide funny scenes throughout the film but truly shine once they try to rob the McCallister house. No matter how brutally Kevin's traps harm them, their reactions are always hilarious and wonderfully over the top. Quite rarely do I find myself laughing out loud while watching a movie, but during Home Alone, I found myself doing it quite often. The comedy, which feels quite carefully administered, always feels natural and never unnecessarily forced. The result, accordingly, is wonderful.Although it took me embarrassingly long to finally watch Home Alone, I'm glad I did. Before seeing it, I never understood why so many people spoke so highly of it. But now, it's easy to see why. It's a wonderful movie filled with Christmas cheer and a heartwarming story, while simultaneously being tremendously entertaining and funny. It's a film that just became a part of my Christmas tradition, and it's one that I absolutely love.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Home Sweet Home,"Home Alone is the classic Christmas film about a kid hoarding off two burglars after he was accidentally left behind when his family goes on a trip to Paris, France (not Paris, Texas). It shows if you leave a kid behind when you take a trip out of the country, it would be funny (I won't recommend you to actually do it though). It isn't one of those films that questions what is the true meaning of Christmas. It is meant to be more for the laughter than what Christmas is supposed to be. I find it pretty funny and it is a must watch for the Christmas season. It definitely helps build the Christmas spirit by watching it. I would definitely recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Unsuccessful robbery or the Little prankster: part one,"Comedy. On the eve of the New Year and Christmas, which will come very, very soon, I decided to recall a series of paintings about the petty prankster Kevin McCallister. And let's start with the first part, of course, whose box office success turned all this disgrace into a series. I can't say that this picture of my childhood, but I definitely managed to watch it, being a small spinner, since this movie was often played on TV, and now it is shown on Channel One EVERY New Year's holidays, forgetting about other films. Anyway. I like this picture, and here's my brief opinion - Unsuccessful robbery. Well, now I ask you not to load the catapults with stale tomatoes, because I intend to tell you not only about the advantages of this Christmas comedy, but also about the disadvantages that I managed to find only now, after many revisions. Then let your humble servant proceed.
So the pros:
1. The story told - well, you already know it without me from A to B, but still. The picture tells the story of the boy Kevin, who, in a hurry, was left by his parents at home. Kevin is at first happy, because the family is far from angelic. But then a problem emerges - they want to rob the house. The hero has no choice but to use improvised means to protect his home from encroachment. Kevin, literally before our eyes, is transforming from a coward and a capricious kid into an intelligent, calculating, courageous and independent boy, and also a defender. In addition to his history, there is also a secondary one, which is no less interesting and gives emotions. The ending is predictable, well-known and moral. After all, the family is much more important than money, no matter how hard they try to refute it. The story may be simple and unpretentious, but catchy. What else do you need for a good Christmas comedy?
2. Atmosphere - the impending holiday reminds of itself literally from every teapot, from every dialogue, from almost every shot, and this is good. Well, and it was not without music, because there are famous Christmas hits and excellent compositions by John Williams, who was responsible for it. Anxiety, loneliness, philosophy, naivety, fear, joy - all these emotions are present here.
3. Humor - if you do not take one moment (we will talk about it in the minuses), then jokes and funny moments are successful here and even still work. I laughed with pleasure again before writing this review. They are unpretentious, sometimes harsh, but they cause a sincere smile even after so many years. This is exactly a comedy, where there is something to laugh at.
So the cons:
1. Replaying - both Kevin and the thieves are terribly replaying. I didn't notice this before, but then it seemed to dawn on me. Okay Kevin, kid, but Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern? What's wrong with them? Adult people, accomplished actors, behave unnaturally in the frame. I understand that in the script they are goofs, but why does it look so creepy? Humor aside, it looks like a silly farce, nothing more. Although no, Macaulay previously acted in films, so he will not give a ride. Why is Kevin so creepy? The acting is visible only in the second half of the picture.
2. Successful traps - more precisely, how well the thieves are substituted under them. They see that it is dangerous, but they go. They see that it is flying, but they stand still. Again, it looks fake. My God, even in the Hong Kong action films of John Woo, opponents were more convincingly exposed to the bullets of the main characters.
A little about the main characters:
1. Kevin McCallister performed by Macaulay Culkin is a capricious child and the youngest in a large family who is tired of his family. Having gone through a series of events, he realizes the value of relatives and friends, despite their unbearable nature. Macaulay played the main character well, although he often overestimated it. Well done!
2. Harry, played by Joe Pesci, is the leader of thieves and, in combination, is a dunce who was able to cheat on a child. Sly, stubborn, and causing danger and a smile, for it causes genuine laughter when it falls into traps. Joe! I will praise you, even in spite of your monstrous overplay. Well done!
2. Marvin played by Daniel Stern - Harry's silly partner, substituting for the most obvious pitfalls. Cowardly, but funny puffs up his eyes and causes laughter, falling into traps. Daniel has a similar story. I will praise, despite the replay. Well done!
I don't consider this picture a masterpiece, but I'm not at all opposed to revising it for New Year or Christmas.
Well, next time we have Kevin's adventures in New York.
As a result, we have a good Christmas comedy about the adventures of Kevin McCallister, with a good script, great music and atmosphere and good acting work (albeit with a replay).

Oozing with Christmas,"A movie that very much came to define the decade it started. Home Alone is a cheesy, lighthearted, popcorny action-comedy-drama. And a really good Christmas movie to boot. Kinda like Die Hard.We all know the story, I trust. Kid gets left behind during the holidays and then has to defend his house against a couple of bumbling burglars. Traps are involved. Traps to make the Looney Tunes proud.And it works, it really works. But I would argue that the reason this film has stayed with people and the reason we still watch it, is because the director Chris Columbus injected in so much Christmas spirit that you'll be stuffed to the brim with it. This is a colourful movie with beautiful sets and enough Christmas lights to provide for an international airfield. It has Christmas songs, Christmas classics on TV. It has a great tree, great morals, and it's just to very Christmassy.At the center of this is Kevin, played by Macaulay Culkin. A wide-eyes, precocious little brat that manages to pull off the almost impossible feat of acting realistically childlike - you know, like a sociopathic, greedy little monster - but still coming off as sympathetic. And sure, in his heart he's a good kid, but the reason we like him is because he's so cheerfully blood hungry. And because he honestly and purely loves Christmas.Is it an odd movie when you think about it? Yeah, a bit. Is it a bit painful to watch all those traps as an adult with a working knowledge of physics? Yes, oh very much so. Is it still a ton of fun? Absolutely.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Favorite classic Christmas movie,"It's an amazing movie really. Despite the fact that it was mixed up with the sequel in my memory, I also remembered it well. Thanks to this, I paid more attention to the details of the environment and looked at the characters better. Fortunately, the film is in high quality. All previous viewings were behind the TV for a snack consisting of last year's salads.The movie doesn't get outdated and looks just as great as the first time. Unlike other classic Christmas movies, this one feels like revisiting. Maybe other films should be given time to brew, but until that happens, I don't want to touch them.I'll probably write about the second part right away. The viewer is unfair to her.

"Be Careful what you wish for, you just might get it!","I don't know why I avoided this film. It's a John Hughes classic film in his style of American suburbia. Macaulay Culkin has the startling role as Kevin McAllister in suburban Chicago town in a beautiful home. He plays the child precociously and with vulnerability at eight years old. After he is banished to the attic, he is forgotten the next day after his parents fly to Paris, France for a family holiday. There were fifteen in all. The scene where they are racing to the plane would be unrealistic today. Kevin believes his family left him alone. With two burglars played by Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci, Kevin learns of their plot to burglarize his home as the silver tuna. Kevin's mother realized that she forgot him at home. Worried and desperate, she would do anything to reunite with them. There are noticeable Chicago actors like Ann Whitney and Alan Wilder in minor roles.

Very Funny!,"Home Alone is a very funny Christmas classic of the early 1990's. I thought that this film would be good, but it's much better than that. The story is about a young child whose family leaves him at home when they all go to Paris. Two dim-witted burglars realize that as well. They planned on robbing the house with no one in their way. Little did they know that Kevin would be the hero of the household. The acting in this film is good especially the robbers played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. They were the funniest part of the film. I also like the music in this film then again I always liked John Williams' music. The only thing a little wrong is the violence. A PG-13 rating would have been more suitable. Otherwise, this is perfect. I rate this film a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Kevin McCallister is left home alone and has to deal with two criminals hot on his tail.,"This movie served merely as the platform for Home Alone 3. Not only was Macaulay Culkin not nearly as good as Alex D. Linz, but the fact that it took this franchise two entire movies to build the scene for number three was rather disappointing.The gags were simply too unrealistic, and the fact that these criminals could not outwit a small child is unbelievable. Not only was Alex D. Linz far cuter than Macaulay Culkin, but he was far better in the role of the abandoned child. The rare highlight in this movie is the break out appearance of John Candy.To fully grasp the quality distance between Home Alone 1 and Home Alone 3, all one must do is observe the fame to which each main actor went on to after their respective movie(s). Alex D. Linz was the star of the classic, Max Keeble's Big Move. On the other hand, Macaulay Culkin was linked to the late Michael Jackson.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"""I Made My Family Disappear""","Some movies are made strictly for adults. Others will bore the heck out of us ""seasoned"" viewers and appeal only to children. Luckily, this movie is made for everyone!For a basic plot summary, ""Home Alone"" sees young Kevin McCalister (Macaulay Culkin) waking up a few days before Christmas in a completely empty house, his extremely large and rather disorganized family having left him behind on their trip overseas. While the family tries to get back home, Kevin must outwit a pair of two-bit thieves (played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) who want nothing more than to loot his home.What really makes this film special is the wide appeal of the humor. One could literally sit down with the entire family (from young to old) and watch this movie, and everyone would be laughing all the way through. From young Kevin's attempts at ""holding down the fort"", to the bumbling burglars played brilliantly by two veteran actors, this is the type of movie that you will be quoting long after the TV is turned off.Thus, I highly recommend ""Home Alone"" to quite literally anyone, especially during the Christmas season. If you have a list of ""Must-See"" holiday movies, this one should be right next to Frosty, ""Wonderful Life"", and claymation Rudolph!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Holiday Classic.,"Review:
'Home Alone' is a comedy film directed by Chris Columbus.
If you were to ask a room full of people what movie they watch the most around the Holiday's, the majority would say 'Home Alone'. This is such a fun tale from writer John Hughes, and it brings some suspense to Christmas while keeping it child friendly.
The story follows eight-year-old Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) who is mistakenly left behind when his family flies to Paris for their Christmas vacation. Kevin initially relishes being home alone, but he soon has to contend with two burglars: Harry Lyme (Joe Pesci) and Marv Merchants (Daniel Stern), who are known as the ""Wet Bandits"".
Macaulay Culkin is a standout in this movie not only because he is in almost every scene, but his acting was very good. He was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy after all. He really holds his own among all the adults in the film and it isn't slim picks when you have Joe Pesci, John Heard and Catherine O'Hara.
It's quite unrealistic about how dumb the burglars are, but honestly, this is a terrific family film. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are a great comedy duo of two idiots who can't rob the place because a child has out witted them and set some clever and very funny traps around the house.
Overall, aside from its unrealistic plot, the movie is fun and very entertaining. It's a movie my family watches multiple times throughout the year and it never gets old.

"A rather stupid movie, for kids only","For some reason Home Alone has always been considered as a classical Christmas movie.I can't understand how any adult can miss the stupidity in this movie: Macaulay Culkin portrays a very annoying child and it is very hard to side with him for the viewer. Parents and siblings are bi-dimensional and there is no depth whatsoever. Generally speaking all characters, including Marley, are rather shallow since the whole point of view is that of a eight year old. The only interesting one is Joe Pesci's burglar, who is still childishly comical as the rest.Among other flaws, we are supposed to believe that a eight year old built an impressive set of booby traps within the span of an afternoon.Let us remark the negative pro-gun message, when a thief refers to Kevin in fear with ""he is armed"".Now with good points: Macaulay Culkin, even though portraying a nasty kid and often screaming, has an impressive on-screen time for a nine year old actor; atmosphere is genuinely positive and suspense is actual at times.One wishes that smarter movies than this one were considered as Christmas movies.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Where Did That Sweet Kid Go?,"A fun family film for the holidays. Macaulay Culkin stars as a young, inadvertently left behind at Christmas when his parents go on holiday, who foils some inept housebreakers, played delightfully by Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci.

Kevin!! And that's the one Marv!,"We are still here in 2023 alongside the amass of Home Alone avid fans that refuse to go anywhere. Yes Home Alone is, and will forevermore engrave its name into the history of great films to be shown or viewed around the festival season. Much like Mariah Carey's 'All i want for Christmas' there is another MC that manages to pull on our emotional strings without fail, every single year... That MC is Macaulay Culkin! With a ""keep the change you filthy Animal"" or ""Do you guys give up, or you thirsty for more?"" Somehow the audience is compelled to still want more.This year was more nostalgia than ever before for me because this year i experienced it for my first time on the big screen. I could probably have lip synced the majority of the script, yet somehow it just seemed extra special on the big screen. From the classic John Williams score, to the incredible pacing/direction of Christopher Columbus and not to forget the influence of John Hughes as producer. The title sequence always gets me, as it was so simplistic as well as being so memorable. When watching Home Alone it feels like time stood still, to allow for a tenacious timeless classic.As a boy i found the character of kevin mccallister very relatable, now as an adult i am still able to relate with Kevin but even more so now i relate to the characters that surround him.One of my favourites is Gus Polinski the polka king of the midwest! (John Candy) was a massive part of my childhood. What is interesting is how little screen time he has but at the same time what a big impact he has. Gus is the pinnacle of what people should be, somebody who is willing to help others in a time of need. John Candy is the perfect example of making an impact during minimal screentime. The Blues Brothers was another great example of this.Macaulay Culkin as Kevin Mccallister is in my opinion the very best portrayal by a child actor of any film or genre, certainly of any i have come across in memory. The charisma of Culkin at such a young age was astonishing as well as being able to recognise and differentiate emotions displayed for various scene was incredible.The wet bandits, what can i say? (Joe Pesci) and (Daniel Stern) owned it as Marv and Harry. There has been attempts since that haven't made a mark on these guys. 'Babies Day Out' and 'Home Alone' 3 please, never is the term often imitated never duplicate more true here. I wonder if they ever could have imagined the impact this film would have on people so much further down the line. Now, T-shirts of the wet bandits or even Gus are more prominent than ever. From headknockers to video games, yes, Home Alone is still being marketed.As i sit here Culkin's face printed on my shirt saying ""keep the change you filthy animal!"" I await my all time favourite scene yet. As much humour and warmth as this film projects; the scene that really hits me is when Kevin has a heart to heart with old man Marley! A little corny, Marley is seen reunited with his son and it's the line ""you can be to old for a lot of things, your never to old to be afraid!"" Well, on that note i will leave you with ""you can be a little too old for lot things, yet... You are never going to be to old to watch"" Home Alone.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Just for Fun,"My response to this movie is strictly prejudiced. For all it violence and lack of verisimilitude, I get a kick out it ever time I see it. If one can't get past the fact that the Wile E. Coyote element is in here (where no one ever seems to get hurt, no matter what), you aren't going to have much fun. With that caveat, the movie is a bit of a hoot. McCauley Culkin came to stardom in this (it's too bad his life became unsettled after this). Watching Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, the ever optimistic though doomed villains, continue to fight a losing cause against an eight year old is the stuff cartoons are made of. Their mugging as they try one thing after another, only to be thwarted, is great fun. The subplot of the mother hooking up with a polka band, led by the inimitable John Candy, adds an element of joy. There is also the relationship that grows with a frightening man next door who has been tabbed a murderer by the insensitivity of the neighborhood kids. This man is estranged from his son and has lapsed into a sad existence. This raises this up from just a kid movie to one with a bit more substance. Anyway, don't take it to seriously and one may have a bit of fun at the holidays.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I watch the two original Home Alone movies with my family every Christmas and we laugh harder with each passing year...

I will love Home Alone till the day I die and I don't know a single soul who doesn't appreciate it. Doesn't matter if you're 7 or 75, everyone can watch this and have a blast!

A Christmas classic,"A Christmas classic. I don't think you celebrate Christmas if you've not seen this film multiple times. If you haven't though let me say it's one of the best Christmas movies out there. It's a fun movie showing the whimsy and fun of a child being home alone, Macaulay Culkin is one of the best child actors of all time, his facial expressions and charisma is superb in this. The comedy is really good no matter how much I've seen it, both Harry and Marc make the funniest noises and remarks. This movie is just superb, there's a really sweet sun plot that feels surprisingly deep and emotional in contrast to the rest of the film. Oh and the score goes unbelievably hard, they did not need to get such a good soundtrack for this film but they really did. My only real complaint is the family aren't the greatest (but they still do work really well, for the little screen time they have you manage to understand a lot of their personalities and even values) and my other complaint is around the ending of the second act and the beginning of the third, the movie slows down a lot and doesn't feel as smooth as the rest of the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I keep forgetting how small he is until the Wet Bandits hang him on the coat rack towards the end. He's a little boy. Yet, he carries a whole movie. It's amazing.

One of My Favorite Christmas Movies!,"Home Alone was always a Christmas stable in my family growing up as a child and will remain so for generations to come. I am hesitant with slapstick-based comedies, but this is how you create a slapstick movie with a meaningful story. Thank you, Chris Columbus and John Hughes for making a movie that became part of a holiday tradition. The story itself has the potential to wear itself out mainly because the idea is simple and paper-thin, but Hughes superb characterization does not allow that to happen. Columbus also added some story elements to provide more emotion. The scenes with Old Man Marley? That was all Columbus...and Marley's story made for a touching ending. Before we get there, however, it is all about the bungling robbers and an eight-year-old kid outsmarting these bandits. Do you want to see Joe Pesci's hair on fire? Or Daniel Stern getting a hot iron to the face? Look no further. I promise ""you will be thirsty for more."" Pesci and Stern are the number one duo of the decade. If not, they are pretty darn close. They were the perfect foil to Kevin McAllister's ruthless defensive skills, because I loved each and every trap that they fell for.The idea for the script came to Hughes's head when he went on vacation and he thought, ""what would happen if I accidentally left my kids behind?"" Perhaps not the absurdity portrayed in the movie, but you get the idea. Hughes gave Chris Columbus the directorial reign after Columbus turned down a National Lampoon movie because he often sparred with Chevy Chase. Columbus liked the Christmas theme and helped rewrite the film to add some more serious layers. He would go on to direct the first two Harry Potter films, but Home Alone may be my favorite movie of his. It is very rare to have this magical of a holiday film. Speaking of magic, it amazes me to this day how an esteemed film composer such as John Williams became attached to this project. Not that I am complaining because his score is magnificent, and it is difficult to surpass ""Somewhere in My Memory."" Let's just say that Williams was not typecast.One of my favorite parts of the movie is ""the movie within the movie."" It is so realistic, I keep thinking that Angels with Filthy Souls is an actual 1940's gangster film. It parodies an actual gangster film, but it was used to great effect. Poor pizza driver. I guess that is a good way to order pizza without paying, huh? It is just one of the many fine comedic moments that Hughes came up with in his script.Kevin McAllister (Macaulay Culkin) is an 8-year-old kid who is a bit of a troublemaker and somewhat resented by his family...especially his extended family. It is around Christmas and the family is preparing for a trip to Paris. After getting into a fight with his older brother Buzz (Devin Ratray), Kevin is sent to his room for the night. He wakes up...and everyone is gone. Everyone left for Paris without him! Rather quickly, he learns how to live independently. It also happens that these two burglars, Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern), plan to rob everyone in the neighborhood on Christmas Eve...including the McAllister home. Kevin is not going to go down with a fight. His makeshift booby traps may help him save the day. Meanwhile, Kevin's mother, Kate (Catherine O'Hara) is worried sick and will do everything possible to go back to the States and find her son. She ends up befriending musician Gus Polinski (John Candy) who will help her where she needs to go.Macaulay Culkin was an easy choice for Hughes because he worked with the child on Uncle Buck. Culkin showed promise in the 1988 film, but he really comes into his own here. He seemed to relish working with legends like Joe Pesci. Speaking of which, I never thought they would be able to get Pesci in a film like this. He and Stern have unbelievable chemistry together as both get to act stupid on set. It was very hard for them not to curse on set because of all the child actors. Pesci famously avoided Culkin on set in order to make him more terrifying while filming. John Candy only had one day to film his scenes, so he was given special permission to improvise. In his brief role, he does a very good job as ""The Polka King."" Also, a shoutout to Robert Blossoms as the ""terrifying' Marley. He really wasn't so terrifying after all. In the end, everyone seemed to have fun on set, and you can see it in the character movements and expressions.Home Alone is an all-time classic Christmas movie that remains popular to this day. It spawned a sequel that is nearly as good despite a recycled plot. The other sequels belong in the ""don't bother watching"" wastebucket. The plot is stretched thin as it can get, but the performances, the gags, and heartfelt emotion save the day. John Williams added a magnificent score that assists in elevating the movie. If you live in a large family, I am sure you can relate to Culkin's character, wanting his family to disappear. But, be careful what you wish for. Home Alone belongs in the highest pantheon of Christmas movies. It does for me at least because it never fails to spread holiday cheer.My Grade: A.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Sentimentality is appropriate for a Christmas movie (and in any event it is good to see Catherine O'Hara, often in overstated comedic roles, playing with a softer edge).

Still widely popular, I watched it every year on Christmas, and it remains a sincere and unapologetically the best and Funniest works set on Christmas.The acting from the kids is impressive, infact throughout theirs good performers. John Candy's minor appearance still made an impact and his energy and charismatic approach seemed great, and left a lasting emotion on you. Ohara was also the seemingly innocent and sweet mother, but was able to show stern and anger and managed it very well, and she was amazing.The premise is thin, but the approach is much wider. Thinking of Kevin, who is only 10 is very much acting like a young and confused kid when left alone. He then develops the sense of warmness by looking after the house from some Robbers and takes action. He also has lots of food, scares and has his own fears. As a 10 year old, that would be very true and it seems very realistic in that approach.The Robbers, with Joe Pesci's Charm, and his mortal angerness is played beautifully, with his robbing and thieving partner abit of a clumsy fool, meaning they have good contrasting relationships, thus it's funnier in the eyes of the audience.I give this film an 8 because it is a brilliant film, and is wholeheartedly influential across the country, and its realism is it's main staple, it's very good, and is up their with the BEST films, should be in the Top 250 easily in my opinion. 8.5 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
You guys give up? Or are you thirsty for more?,"Home Alone is one of my favorite Christmas movies of all time. Of course there are plenty of great films in the genre, but nothing to me says Christmas like Kevin McCallister taking on the wet bandits in this hilarious 1990 comedy classic.Written and produced by the great John Hughes, and directed by Chris Columbus. This is one film that will always live on in cinema history thanks to its amazing cast, original story, and the loads of fun and memorable moments that keep the fans coming back for more.Home Alone is pure gold as far as entertainment goes, and if you haven't seen this before, it's a must see movie that never disappoints.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Christmas Classic,"Home Alone is really the movie that refuses to die. It's a guarantee that, from November 1 to December 25, no matter where you live in the world, there's always a channel airing this movie. It's earned the disdain of some (as a result of overexposure) and the delight of others, particularly child star Macaulay Culkin, for whom this film is still a steady source of guaranteed income.There's just something about Home Alone that makes it particularly special. It has a color palette that just feels like Christmas, with a score that has everything you need for the quintessential ""sound"" of Christmas.Macaulay Culkin brilliantly carries this film as young Kevin McCallister in a performance that will forever be regarded as one of the best from a child actor. After wishing his parents would ""just disappear,"" Kevin wakes up to find that, in the hustle of getting to the airport for their vacation on time after sleeping in, he was left behind. Now the ""man of the house,"" Kevin needs to protect the house and survive on his own. Of course, being a slapstick comedy, hijinks (in the form of Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci) ensue.One thing Home Alone does really well is deliver a ton of heart. Culkin knows exactly what is needed to pull off the emotional power of the scenes. You can watch this film and genuinely feel the loneliness and desire he has to be with his family; the regret he feels for the things he said to them. And, as Christmas day gets closer and the family does all they can to get home with him, you can't help but get a tear in your eye.It's one of those rare, perfectly-balanced movies that can make you laugh, cry and feel uplifted all at once, and with an impressive supporting cast around Culkin. There's definitely a reason why this film is so highly regarded, and it's one that will outlive all of us. Truly, a timeless Christmas classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A Holiday Tradition Since 1990!,"This is my favorite holiday movie! Yes, that MUST mean that I am a caring person (because it's sweet and funny)! I didn't see this because I was 3 at the time (and I didn't watch movies in a theater until 1991), but I have seen this on TV every year and I used to watch the DVD and VHS versions of this! And yes, they are all great! And so are things like using a fake movie to scare pizza delivery guys and burglars away, using train sets with sticks and cardboard people and loud music to fool people into think that there's a party going on, and more! ""Home Alone"" is, in fact, one of the greatest holiday movies ever made. What else is there to say?",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Movie That Defines The Holiday Season,"I have a friend who I once saw call the Holiday Season, the Home Alone Season. It's amazing to think how this movie was made many years ago, but is widely remembered and still regularly watched. It seems like almost all of us have seen Home Alone, and it seems like most people have seen it more than once. For one, I wouldn't recommend watching this movie outside of the Holiday Season, just how you likely wouldn't listen to Christmas music outside of the Holiday Season even though you could. I mean this movie just gives you the Christmas spirit when it's around. I watched this movie around 6 months ago, and it just didn't seem as enjoyable as it used to seem, and I just thought it's best if I wait until the Holiday Season to see it, even though you can probably find it on TV all year round, and during the Holiday Season it will be on ABC Family. It's just better to get into the Christmas Spirit when Christmas is around. Anyway, I just left a review on the 2nd Home Alone movie. I prefer the 2nd one over this as I feel like the 2nd one is more funny and we see Kevin in a more exciting place than home, as in the 2nd movie he's in NYC. In this movie, he's home alone in his quiet neighborhood where most of the other neighbors seem gone and a neighborhood that's being burglarized at the same time by Marv and Harry. However, while watching this movie I noticed there aren't many exciting scenes until the climax of the movie. Kevin is also somewhat of a brat, especially during the beginning of the movie like the way a kid who is supposed to be 8 talks to his Mom. This movie shows family time as showing a rich family inviting their extended family over and all trying to leave for Paris. So, we remember the opening scene showing a family that is in a hurry all around the house and Kevin feeling ditched by his family and being a brat about that. While this movie has it's flaws it is still somewhat enjoyable, I mean we've all seen it and I think a lot of us are tired of it because we've seen it many times and basically know what's going to happen. Also, I'm surprised this movie has done so well as a movie. One similar movie I prefer over Home Alone is Blank Check. I think Blank Check has more of a plot than Home Alone. By all means, this movie is still good and entertaining. I'll want to watch this movie again during the Holiday Season just to get myself into the Christmas Spirit. I give this movie an 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A Christmas with laughter,"This movie was made during the Christmas holidays starring one of the best young movie stars named Macaulay Culkin. The holidays started off well when the McCallister Family decides they want to go to Paris for the holidays. Kevin feels the family does not notice that things just don't seem right until the night before the family was leaving for Paris that things go down hill. The next day when leaving for Paris they do something that no family would ever do like leave your child at home and be 1,000 miles away. What happens next while his family tries getting back will make you wonder can Kevin prove to his parents anything is possible to protect himself being alone. I think that after seeing this and buying it that anything can happen when children think before doing. Kevin has to not only care for his self but protect the home from the burglars that are out there. Can Kevin do it and his family get back in time for Christmas.

A Great Christmas Movie,"Home Alone is an amazing movie. There are many sequels to this movie, and this movie outshines all of them I've seen. This movie is better than Home Alone 2, Home Alone 3, and Home Alone 4. Home Alone just has great great actors. Every actor shines in front of the glowing light. This film is just really funny, even when the Wet Bandits are not getting hurt. It just has a clever plot that gets ruined and completely changed in Home Alone 3. I gotta say, my favorite characters are either Kevin or the Wet Bandits. Really Macaulay Culkin plays great as Kevin. It's literally a perfect match. I wish that there was a sequel with Macaulay Culkin and he meets the Wet Bandits again from his childhood. Kinda like A Christmas Story Christmas. In all, I give this movie a 8.6 out of 10.

Woy,"If you remember your childhood connected with the TV, this film ""Home Alone"" comes to mind first of all. How much laughter there was, despite the fact that the story, in general, is not the simplest and for each parent it is simply critical and, in general, impossible (I hope). But what I would like to note is that this picture was almost able to repeat the success for the second time, but in subsequent franchises, in my opinion, the picture did not receive a proper response. The main character, as history showed, was stuck in the role of a little boy, which did not reflect in the best way on his life, but the actor played his role superbly. I advise everyone to watch this film, not only on Christmas Eve, but also just when you want to cheer up.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Christmas Classic You should give a chance,This is a really good family film so long as you can get through the slapstick.Home alone is pretty much as it says. A family decides to go to Paris for the holidays. Unfortunately in their rush they left one small thing behind...their youngest son. Now he not only must take on the task of managing the house but he also needs to outwit some burglars before they take over. Will he get through the holidays alive? This movie is kind of looked at as a simple slapstick movie but in truth all of the slapstick is pretty much in the last 10 minutes of the movie. The rest of the movie is a pretty nice and touching Christmas tale that covers the areas of family and togetherness. The acting is fairly decent in this film and the characters are pretty likable. The music is very well done and the setting really gives you the feel of a true Christmas classic. If you haven't watched this film yet then definitely check it out.,8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A Christmas tale,"It is hardly possible to imagine the New Year and Christmas without a close family holiday, which necessarily involves watching a certain list of films together that have already become family and are clearly associated with snow, Christmas songs and warmth in the soul. One of these paintings, undoubtedly, has long and successfully become the tape ""Home Alone"". Now it's a classic, I'm not afraid of that word. Chris Columbus's masterpiece does not become obsolete, and you are looking forward to the next New Year's holidays to review the film about the boy and the robbers again.Macaulay Culkin, I think, will forever remain for the audience, first of all, a tomboy Kevin McCallister, who, according to the plot of the picture, remains alone at home when his family simply forgets the boy in a hurry to get to the airport. The actor managed to embody on the screen the versatile personality of a growing boy who successfully conveys determination, fear, distrust, and love of his character. His Kevin turned out to be really alive and so dear. The viewer can trace the evolution of a character who at first does not appreciate his family and relatives, but then realizes how important family ties and the closest people, especially mom, are. The duet of Culkin and Catherine O'Hara, who played the boy's mother, turned out to be excellent and convincing.But the robbers, who are embodied on the screen by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, turned out to be much more charismatic. That's whose tandem pleases throughout the film. The legendary now ""wet bandits"" find themselves in a situation where they have to literally fight for their lives with an eight-year-old boy. And if at first it seemed to the robbers that they would more than outplay the tomboy, then subsequent events show how difficult such a confrontation can be. The characters of Pesci Stern - Harry and Marv - are both charming, funny and dangerous. The scenario moves reveal the duet perfectly, give the opportunity to enjoy the virtuoso performance of the actors.The creators took a responsible approach to their work, offering a lot of funny moments to the delight of the audience. And even though this film has little to do with reality, the picture is designed to endow the Christmas holiday with exactly what people lack in everyday life - the feeling of a fairy tale, the opportunity to believe in miracles. After all, if you believe, then, probably, they can come true. And this movie will definitely prove it.The film came out strong. To see the picture has become a kind of mandatory reason for spending time in front of the screen on New Year's holidays. ""Home Alone"" after decades remains one of the favorite projects that you watch yourself and show to the younger generation. Yes, there are a decent number of violent scenes in the film, but if you clearly understand that all this is not real, and it's literally a fairy tale on the screen, then the whole family can laugh heartily.9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The cast fits perfectly and executed the same. Kevin is like a bag if three stooges with an arsenal of toys and traps to humiliate his foes. Never less it is a must see and have.

Painfully funny festive classic,"Home Alone is a quintessential Christmas movie with a beautifully simple premise. It's a be careful what you wish for story as well as some of the biggest wish fulfilment since it revolves around a child who can do whatever they want. Like all the best Christmas movies there's a genuine heart to it that can bring you to tears by the end but what makes this such a classic is the painfully slapstick unleashed at the end.Macaulay Culkin gives a great lead performance as his precious nature is matched by his resourcefulness. He's very funny with a real gift for big expressions that hide nothing. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are a wonderfully chaotic combo who are naturals when it comes to their comedic timing towards the end. Catherine O'Hara and Roberts Blossom really bring the heart to proceedings, ensuring the ending has the required emotional heft.Chris Colombus' direction imbues the film with a boundless warmth and a festive aesthetic that is the embodiment of how the ideal Christmas should be in look and feel. It peaks at the end which is ideal for this as all the best slapstick and biggest emotional moments arrive come back to back to end on the biggest high. For a film this wholesome, John Williams is a perfect choice to compose the score and his music here is some of his most empathetic stuff.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Not the Best Christmas Movie Ever but Pretty Damn Close,"I wouldn't give this film the title of best Christmas movie ever, that title belongs to Arthur Christmas, but it gets pretty damn close. The premise is instantly interesting, the antics are fun and goofy but also feel like something a kid would do if left home alone and the cast, oh the cast. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern light up the screen together while Katherine O'Hara manages to bring a sense of urgency to everything that the other adult actors don't. Then there is Macaulay Culkin. I don't think he's great but for a child actor at this time he could have been a whole lot worse and personally I think his over reaction to everything just adds to the charm of this film. I love the stunt work here and the use of practical effects all of which bring a weight to the onscreen action, I think the score is brilliant, as with everything that Joh Williams does it's instantly recognizable and something you can hum along to. As I said it's not the best Christmas film but it makes a valiant attempt and easily gets a solid 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Up there with Christmas Story as a timeless Christmas classic,"Home Alone (1990) is a movie my daughter and I recently watched together on Disney+. The storyline follows a family that gets together for the holidays for a trip to Europe. In the morning of the trip it gets so busy with family, neighbors and friends that they accidentally leave without the youngest child, Kevin. Kevin will need to survive the holidays on his own which includes creepy neighbors, cooking for himself...and thieves...This movie is directed by Chris Columbus (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone) and stars Macaulay Culkin (The Good Son), Joe Pesci (Goodfellas), Daniel Stern (City Slickers), John Heard (Big), Catherine O'Hara (Beetlejuice) and John Candy (The Great Outdoors).There is so much that is outstanding about this movie. There is a great set-up of the family dynamic and how busy it is. The gangster movie throughout the film was perfectly selected. The circumstances are fun to watch. Caulkin executes his role to perfection, like Peter Billingsly as Ralphie in Christmas Story. The robbery scenes are cinematic gold and make you laugh every time you see them no matter how many times you've seen them. There's also some fantastic cameos in this as well.Overall this is a 90's Christmas Story that is timeless and will forever be one of the great Christmas classics. This is an easy 10/10 and a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Classic!,"I watched it countless times. I can't remember how many times anymore. And the best thing about it is that I never got bored by watching it again and again. It is always something you laugh again off, always something you discover, because really, there are many, many easter eggs in this movie. The plot is about a boy called Kevin, his parents and his family who forget to take him with on the way to France, and as the movie title says, he is Home Alone. Then, he has to deal with the biggest problems, all alone. And it is just so fun watching a kid dealing with great problems across a whole movie. I don't know about a greater comedy than this one. The humor is new, fresh and original. There are many exaggerated parts here and there, but at the same time it holds a good balance. When the action comes, it is very entertaining, introducing the amazing Home Alone music theme by John Williams. You know, that guy is always making something new, and his music always fits perfect.

Good film,"Good Christmas film. Love the holiday spirit. Forget the critics they're always wrong. Its really good. The cast is very good! It was sweet to see John Candy in it! The team work of Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern is just not insanely hilarious but it's also incredible that the two are so good together and I like how their scenes of punishment is followed right after the other! I think John Heard looks like Bruce Willis! I like Catherine O'Hara, she is a fine actress! Look for Larry Hankin and Roberts Blossom! John Williams has another great score here!

Geeky Randy's summary,"Christmas staple for anyone born in the mid/late-'80s. The McCallisters, an upper-class Chicago family, rushes to the airport for a holiday in Paris, accidentally forgetting the runt: eight-year-old Culkin. The real fun (and danger) comes when the youngster decides that he's ""the man of the house"" and challenges two dim-witted burglars Pesci and Stern with a funhouse of traps (some slapstick, others legitimately harmful). Writer/producer Hughes and director Columbus do a pretty good job of working around the incompetency of the whole fiasco—but a lot of things in the film comes together so well thanks to an underrated supporting cast, particularly Bamman, Blossom, Heard and O'Hara. Instantly entertaining, and has a lot of replay value with some suspension of disbelief.**** (out of four)",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Home Alone is a favorite of the entire family.,"My entire family loves this movie. It's not only a holiday favorite but a year-round pleaser. My children, 8 and 4, think Kevin is a national hero of sorts.  Home Alone has it all:  Comedy, Drama, Action and Suspense. And for a special treat; make it a double feature with Home Alone II:  Lost In New York. Both movies are well acted and amazingly well directed.

A holiday classic!,"This film is one of the all-time great holiday films, probably ranking a distant second behind A Christmas Story. I remember when ten years ago I saw Home Alone at the theater I said you have a instant classic. I guess my prediction was right, I know when I hear many people talk about a film for years that the popularity is overwhelming and also it must have sent a good message to people. Home Alone continues to get many airings just the other day I watched this classic on HBO. The ingredients for success in the form of the writing from John Hughes really made this film so enjoyable, and you know how good John Hughes delivers a sweet and likeable film. The story is crazy but also funny as Macaulay Culkin as a precarious 8-year-old who accidentally is left behind by his vacationing family, in the meantime Culkin must battle a twosome of goofy and inept burglars wonderfully depicted by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. I must say that Joe Pesci is a great actor not only is he seriously funny but he is just plain and simply the best at anything he does! Qualify Pesci as a very underrated actor. And Culkin enjoys the adventure of a lifetime filled with many laughs and giggles to crack you up! It just goes to show you many times an individual can have the most fun when left alone. No matter how many times you have seen Home Alone watch this classic every holiday season it's a film to enjoy for a lifetime.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Christmas film,"'""Home Alone"" is a classic Christmas movie that was released in 1990. Directed by Chris Columbus and written by John Hughes, the film stars Macaulay Culkin as Kevin McCallister, an eight-year-old boy who is accidentally left behind by his family when they go on vacation for the holidays. The film has become a beloved holiday classic and remains popular with both children and adults alike.The story begins with the McCallister family preparing to go on a Christmas vacation to Paris. However, amidst the chaos of getting everyone ready, they accidentally leave Kevin behind. Kevin initially relishes his newfound freedom and enjoys having the house all to himself. However, he soon realizes that he must defend his home against a pair of burglars, Harry and Marv, who are attempting to rob the house.One of the things that make ""Home Alone"" such a beloved film is its blend of comedy and heartwarming moments. Kevin's antics as he sets up booby traps to thwart the burglars are both hilarious and creative, while his interactions with a lonely old man named Marley add a touch of warmth and sentimentality to the story. Additionally, the film's message about the importance of family and the value of human connections is a timeless one that resonates with audiences of all ages.The performances in ""Home Alone"" are also noteworthy, particularly Macaulay Culkin's portrayal of Kevin. Culkin was just ten years old at the time of filming, but he delivers a performance that is both charming and funny. The chemistry between Kevin and the burglars, played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, is also excellent. Pesci and Stern bring a level of physical comedy to their roles that is both entertaining and impressive.Another aspect of ""Home Alone"" that has helped it stand the test of time is its iconic score. The film's theme song, ""Somewhere in My Memory,"" was composed by John Williams and has become synonymous with the holiday season. The score also features other memorable tracks, such as ""Star of Bethlehem"" and ""Setting the Trap.""
While ""Home Alone"" is generally regarded as a family-friendly film, it does contain some moments of violence and peril that may be too intense for very young children. Kevin's booby traps are often quite dangerous, and the burglars suffer several injuries throughout the film. Additionally, there are a few scenes in which Kevin is shown in danger or distress, such as when he encounters a scary old man in a church. Parents should exercise caution when deciding whether or not to show this film to young children.In conclusion, ""Home Alone"" is a timeless classic that has become a beloved Christmas movie. Its mix of comedy, heartwarming moments, and iconic score make it a must-watch for many families during the holiday season. The performances by Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, and Daniel Stern are excellent, and the film's message about the importance of family is a valuable one. While it may be too intense for very young children, ""Home Alone"" is a film that continues to entertain and delight audiences of all ages.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""Home Alone"" is a real New Year's tradition and the love","""Home Alone"" is not just a family film, it is a whole story that lives in each of us, moving from the old year to the new one, starting from childhood, when we were all children and the world seemed like a solid Christmas present.Home Alone is a truly cult movie, yes, and perhaps the best and probably the only film that you always want to watch on the eve of the outgoing year, it is thoroughly imbued with the spirit of Christmas, mischief, fun and touching family moments. This is a film on which more than one generation has grown up and to this day it remains one of the most striking and recognizable in its genre.The creation of Home Alone did not inspire any confidence in the film studios, no matter how ironic it may be, but the story has lived on for more than 30 years and does not lose its relevance. It is quite obvious that such a simple, but at the same time very catchy plot was once brought to life by John Hughes. Despite the modest budget and past failures of Chris Columbus, who, in a word, is a very famous director today, Hughes still managed to achieve what he wanted, and so the idea that arose literally out of nowhere took shape.Hughes was a man with a big heart who never forgot about children and created kind and sincere family stories, remember at least ""Curly Sue"", ""Dennis the Tormentor"", ""101 Dalmatians"" or ""Flubber"". I suppose that all those who saw these films as a child were really lucky and I really feel very sorry that there are so few films like this nowadays, such that they carry elements of both comedy and drama, and always please their viewers, from view to view.The plot of the film is familiar to everyone not by hearsay, but by repeated viewings on cold but cozy winter evenings. At the center of the action is the American family McCallister, who are probably better off never traveling at Christmas, because they are staying with a myriad of relatives with children and, as a result, a real chaos reigns in the house at 671 Lincoln Boulevard. It is not surprising that one child can inadvertently get lost, taking into account the fact that all family members and their relatives rely on only one alarm clock and are not at all used to getting up early. Kevin was lucky and the whole family, which gave him so much trouble, disappeared in an instant, leaving the younger McCallister on guard.The role of Kevin McCallister made Macaulay Culkin an extremely famous child actor, and a little later such works as ""My Girl"", ""Good Son"" and ""Richie Rich"" appeared. I think we should not now go into further details of Macaulay's acting career and fate, but capture only what positive emotions he brought to millions of children and adults around the world.It's amazing how a film without a fabulous budget and famous actors could reach unprecedented heights. But now there are no people who would not recognize Catherine O'Hara or John Heard from frames from a famous film.There is a person in the world who can make you worry, laugh and cry in a matter of minutes, and his name is John Williams - an infinitely talented composer who creates the most beautiful and memorable soundtracks that skillfully complement any work in which he is only involved.There is a lot of cynicism, greed and anger in our world, and so little kindness, and Home Alone gives us such warmth, love and care, albeit at times and in a very peculiar way.""Home Alone"" is a real New Year's tradition and the love of many generations of viewers, it is a very bright movie, somewhat exaggerated, fabulous, naive, capable of turning back the clock and returning us to the country of childhood, allowing us to understand that each of us has his own New Year's miracle.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Terrific comedy,"""Home Alone"" went on the become a box office sensation when first released in late 1990. It stayed at the top of the box office as the #1 film for its first 12 weeks of release. Quite impressive. Kids of all ages just loved this movie about a little 8-year-old boy who gets accidentally left home all by himself after his family rushes off to spend Christmas in France. Macaulay Culkin is terrific as Kevin, the boy left home alone. He pretty much is the whole show here. His charisma and presence help make ""Home Alone"" as good as it is. However, this movie is not a classic. If it wasn't for the ridiculously crazy climax this movie would have been better. Of course the climax is the part that made everybody laugh out loud, when the kid takes on those inept burglars by setting up booby traps that are just too far-fetched to be believable. This part still makes me laugh, but I just can't believe that an 8-year-old could dream up of stuff like that. And writer-producer John Hughes would inject this style of slapstick humor into alot of his following movies (including ""Baby's Day Out"", ""Curly Sue"", and of course the two ""Home Alone"" sequels). The slapstick violence is at times a bit too much, but it doesn't go too far (though the first sequel ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" did get more violent in its slapstick comedy). Director Chris Columbus had his first smash hit with ""Home Alone"". He followed this with ""Home Alone 2"", ""Mrs. Doubtfire"", and most recently ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"". Columbus knows that he can work beautifully with kids, and ""Home Alone"" is where he got his start. He makes Culkin look as good as he is. The supporting cast is fine (Catherine O'Hara and John Heard are good as Culkin's parents; Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are wonderfully bumbling as the clumsy burglars), and Hughes script has some wonderfully heartfelt touches. ""Home Alone"" may not be the best comedy movie ever made, but it's still a good one. I'll take ""Home Alone"" over Hughes idiotic ""Baby's Day Out"" anytime.*** (out of four)",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""I Made My Family Disappear!""","The first of a string of classic Christmas movies made in the 1990's, features Macaulay Calkin Kevin McAlister, who - after an argument with his family and an ill-timed power outage - ends up being left at home whilst his parents, siblings and other relations fly to Paris. Prowling the very rich neighbourhood are two hapless, bumbling burglars, who decide fatefully that they'll break into the McAlister house and clean it out. Poor them, because Kevin - when he isn't shopping for groceries, cooking dinner and making friends with alleged killer Old Man Marley from across the road - sets out a series of booby traps that put the Wet Bandits through the ringer in all sorts of comedically violent ways. The scene where Marv steps on the nail never, ever fails to make me shiver. John Williams delivers a gem with ""Somewhere in My Memory,"" which is the film's orchestral theme, and how can you not love a movie with a John Candy cameo?So many great scenes, with an overall message of the importance to family togetherness, especially at Christmastime.So much fun.

"Timeless, one of the best Christmas films in a long time, and one of the best family movies ever made","Home Alone is underrated according to the IMDb. It only has a 6.4 out of ten.

It isn't a dark movie, but it isn't all fluffy like some of the movies released today that are considered family movies. It is also one of the best Christmas movies ever made, and is still the last great Christmas movie released to this day.There are three sequels; Home Alone 2 is pretty good, Home Alone 3 is bad, but Home Alone 4 is a made for TV flop, so I won't say anything else. I'm not sure why, but it seems like many kids prefer the 2nd and 3rd Home Alone movies over the first one. I don't see their reasons for that.This is a great movie for kids, and many kids can relate to it. I'm sure every kid out there has wished they could be alone and away from their family, but what kid would know what to do if two burglars were after him.

One of the all-time greats of Christmas movies!,"I've watched this all my life, year after year every holiday season, and for plenty of good reasons! It's a lot of fun, and it captures the spirit of christmas in an ironic way. A boy, neglected by his family, left all alone unintentionally, gets the house and all the fun and freedom he desired while his family is away. At first he's scared, but warms up to the idea of unsupervised fun for a good long while. Yet over time, he begins to realize the true meaning of family, simultaneously the mother desperate to get back to him, realizes what true attachment is as she finds whatever means possible to return (including a cameo of John Candy). Of course the fun is where Kevin uses traps on two bumbling burglars, all inventive (my favorites are the blowtorch on the door, the iron in the chute, nail on the stairs, and the paint cans). Before that, Kevin will have to learn about his neighborhood, and discover what one neighbor is really like. I won't reveal anything, but you'll come out smiling and heartwarmed.

Christmas Classic,"Having just watched this for the first time in ages and at the cinema for the first time since its release I am reminded of what a fun film this is. It works very well as a feel good Christmas movie and as a live action update of a loony tunes cartoon. My feeling s about this film have not really changed at all in the eighteen years since its release. It is a small idea with a huge pay off. When Kevin (a never bettered Macualay Culkin) is left home alone over Christmas when his family leave for a trip to Paris and accidentally forget him, he is left to fend for himself as a pair of burglars tries to invade his home. For a child actor Culkin does a remarkable job practically carrying the movie on his own, appearing in pretty much every scene. The burglars are fended of in a string of comedy sequences that a very funny and aided no end by Joe Pesci playing the leader of the pair Harry. There is a convenient sub plot where Kevin finds friendship from the unlikely source of the neighbourhood old man all the kids are scared of.

The film is filled with slapstick humour which will leave you laughing hysterically. There's also some subplots which will leave you nice and warm for the holidays.

Another scene I loved was when Kevin had to guts to face her fears of the basement appliance. I liked all the diverse personalities of the kids in the house. Each one was equally unique and different. It is definitely my all time favorite Christmas movie. The movie is a must-see for all avid Christmas fans. Sit back and enjoy this wild ride.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Kevin!,"Home Alone. Kevin! Probably one of the best Christmas movies ever. It's a great comedy and Kevin's words to think about, as well as snow, a tree and Christmas!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A great family film!,Home Alone is a great family film that is pretty funney! In the movie Kevin McCallister(Macauly Culkin) hates being the youngest member of his big family! On the night before his family plans to take holiday trip to Paris Kevin gets in trouble and is sent to the third floor. While there Kevin wishes for his family to disappear and in the morning gets his wish as his family leaves in a hurry to get to the airport and leaves Kevin home alone! Kevin enjoys being home alone but soon feels bad for the way he acted towards them and misses them! He also learns that two burglars named Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern) are planning to break into his home and that he must defend his house with traps for the burglars! My favorite scene in the movie is where Harry and Marv finally meet each other in the house after walking through several of Kevin's traps and Harry asks Marv Why the hell ya take your shoes off? And Marv asks Harry Why the hell ya dressed like a chicken? I just died laughing at that scene! Filled with wonderful laughter and humor Home Alone is a true family movie that the whole family can enjoy! I laugh every time I see it! 10 out of 10!,10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Never gets old,"Growing up with this film I felt very lucky
It has a wonderful story and it will always stay throughout my family
It's fun, memorable. It has all the charms of Christmas 🎄
Every Christmas you should sit with your family and enjoy it together. It's warm and endearing, you have a family who goes away and forgets their youngest son. The youngest son has to save his house from the wet bandats, but he has a plan in store for them 😉 and you will have to watch to see how it end.Kevin is one Kid you don't want to mess with on Christmas
It's a film that will be around for ever. Kevin's mum releases Kevin is home alone and she has to find a way to get back to Kevin on Christmas day
But the movie has more then just one story and it really gives you a warm and wholesome feeling and a really good laugh.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Perfection!!,"No other movie contains so many wonderfully perfect characters, all of whom are perfectly cast, all of whom show strength, humour, inventiveness and frustration to such a relatable level!! We can understand the stresses of travelling with family, of a mother's total panic, of a child who thinks it's all fantastic (and a big game), of a strange neighbour, a seemingly stranger polka band( whom I nearly sure is a continuance of John candy character from trains, planes and automobiles, if a different name maybe he tell her his ""stage name""?),of how it all ends!! From the youngest child in your family to the eldest adult( who'll end up feeling like a child again) this is the best movie of all time, not just Christmas. Everybody loves it, I cannot understand how anyone could ever put this movie down. Where ever you are in the world you can put this movie on and laugh, it transcends language even, where in, you don't need sound to appreciate exactly what's going on, you understand perfectly from everyone's perspective. It's absolutely the perfect movie for everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A great family movie.,"I loved this movie. It's a really funny movie that your family will like. The plot has to deal with a little kid who is mad at his family. He wishes they would just go away. Than one day when he's supposed to go to France, the family is rushing and they forget to take him. So he now has the house to himself, thinking he made them disappear. Macaulay Culkin was just great as Kevin McCallister, the kid who just wants to be alone but soon regrets it. This is like a childhood dream. I remember when I was mad at my family. Along with that, he has to deal with two robbers. He does the coolest thing, he sets traps through his house. Using all types of things like a blow torch and feathers. It's as funny as it sounds. Check it out if you haven't. Get it on Christmas and watch it with your family. You'll all love it. Home Alone: A",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"""Home Alone"" Not Just a Christmas Movie!","I have loved Home Alone ever since I was a little kid. I don't remember a Christmas where I haven't watched the movie. The plot is perfect and the way the actors portray the characters seems like a real family/group of people. I feel as if I have a real connection to the McCallister family and I feel like I am part of the family. Perhaps it's because I'm an only child and maybe the black sheep of my family but I feel a strong connection to Kevin and I understand what he's going through. I also like the adults in the movie even if they are horrible for leaving Kevin home alone. I am glad that Hine Alone was made when it was because the plot would be virtually impossible today. While ""Home Alone"" is marketed as a Christmas film, it is also a film that I can watch any time of the year often multiple times of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""Look what ya did ya little jerk!""","Home Alone (1) (1990) -There was a time when I found this film to be really quite annoying, but I have come to love it over the years and it is most definitely included on my watch list for every Christmas.The film was full of great characters and silly situations that were so extreme that they can only be funny.I actually thought that Kevin was a bit dumped upon and the fact that his parents left him at home on his own, shows their lack of time for him, so it's no wonder that he acted up occasionally. If I were the parents, I think I would have stopped having kids after Buzz was born, because - What a nasty child he was?Weirdly, I think the film had some moral content as well as being a laugh-fest of slapstick shenanigans, as Kevin defended his home against two inept burglars and learned to be more mature and not to judge his neighbour based on rumours. He was quite a smart kid and had the potential to be lovely, with his naivety and innocence, if someone would have just given him the time of day. He was a scared little boy, who did the best in a bad situation, that wasn't really his fault.There were some lovely touches included, comically and with emotional depth and a clever mind must have come up with the execution of Kevin's house defence plans.The soundtrack was also superb, full of classics and incidental music that have become part of our culture.Could you defend your house in the same situation?950.91/1000.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
An Honest Review,"A psychopath in the making. Hannibal Lecter as a child. Here we see the development of a very young Ted Bundy.It's a movie about a sadist child that is left alone and gets to torture two people and eat cheese pizza until his little heart is content.But don't worry, the guys that he is torturing are burglars so it's OK that the kid violates the Geneva Convention..so it's fine that you are laughing at a child torturing bad guys...they are, after all, bad guys.There are educated men, like me, that used to love to play GTA and kill my best friends in HALO because, we love to show that sadistic side...if no one gets hurt.I live in a world where I have to say ""Oh my God, are you OK?"" when someone gets hurt...and when I get off I go hang out with my friends who would be acting very strange indeed if they didn't laugh first when I got hurt.Ask my Girlfriend, my mom, and my little sister...ask any woman I have ever dated, it's not just a guy thing, they all love watching me hurt myself.This movie has caught a lot of flack, but it does so because it is made for the part of you that wants to laugh at someone else's pain. It does a wonderful job of showcasing how funny it is when people get hurt...The issue is that they don't want to admit that they think someone's pain is funny.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""Keep the change, ya filthy animal!""","FILM: 8.5/10.Ah, Home Alone, a Christmas classic that needs no introduction. What can one say about it that hasn't been said before? Well, I won't attempt the impossible.In a nutshell, Home Alone seamlessly weaves traditional Christmas themes with uproarious comedy and slapstick. There's an undeniable joy in watching a kid take on grown men in a symphony of hilariously comical beatdowns. It's the kind of cinematic catharsis that never gets old.Sure, the plot's technological irrelevance in today's mobile-dominated world is glaring. A quick call would resolve the entire predicament. Yet, Home Alone's charm transcends its outdated premise, entertaining on a nostalgic level that warms the heart.Macaulay Culkin, in his iconic role, manages not to overstay his welcome-well, mostly. The initial excessiveness mellows, and by the film's end, it delivers a surprisingly solid message, even if the finale leans a tad too saccharine for my taste. Fortunately, it doesn't overshadow the rest.The true magic unfolds when Culkin faces off against Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. The mischief, the traps, the sheer chaos - it's a festive spectacle that captures the spirit of Christmas in an unconventional, albeit hilarious, way. Nothing says 'tis the season like watching these two stumble through a gauntlet of burns, impalements, and face-smashing.Home Alone isn't just a movie; it's a time capsule of holiday joy. Its enduring appeal lies not just in the laughs but in its ability to transport you back to a simpler, more mischievous time. So, when you find yourself in need of a Christmas pick-me-up, just let young Kevin McCallister and his ingenious traps work their holiday magic.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 9/10.Native 4K presentation, Detail level: Excellent, Colour reproduction: Excellent, Level accuracy: Good, Encode: Good, Master condition: ExcellentAUDIO: 8/10.DTS-HD MA 5.1 audio, Dialogue reproduction: Excellent, Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent, Dynamics: Good, Surround sound presentation: Good, LFE content: GoodMOOFIEMETER: 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
10 out of 10 Movie for sure,"Not sure why it took me so long to review my favorite christmas film of all time but here it goes. I was 10 when this came out, and back then, I remember watching it at least 10 times at the movies. I loved it then and loved it now. Yes, it is a little far fetched, and would not happen in real life, but it is a movie, and not to be taken seriously! I stopped watching after Home alone 2 because Macaulay Culkin made the film what it was, and no one could replace him. I was NOT interested in seeing parts 3 and 4 because he was not it them. Lots of funny one liners in this movie. Since I watch it every year, I can recite every line, word for word. The actors and characters were spot on. The christmas sountrack here is my favorite of all time. This will forever be a classic and will always be my favorite christmas movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A true Christmas classic for any season.,"The strange slapstick turn that the silly third act takes is a bit of an odd choice which remarkably doesn't stunt the film's growth despite being a departure from the relatively down-to-earth proceedings that precede it. It's only because it acts as a natural extension to the expert character development already done in the first two acts that it slots in so successfully, ending 'Home Alone (1990)' on an uproarious if (strangely) slightly sadistic note which represents the hero's transformation from naïvely vulnerable to cunningly independent. The layered screenplay puts everything in its perfectly imperfect place during the impeccable set-up, allowing for the forgetting of a child to become wholly believable and entirely empathetic. Plus, the wonderfully ostentatious performances place everything in a state of heightened reality ripe for rib-tickling laughter and heart-warming sentiment. A true Christmas classic for any season. 8/10",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Mistake in film,"Home Alone is one of my favorite movies. In fact I have memorized almost every line from the movie. There is one mistake not mentioned on this site. In Home Alone Kevin is 8. In Home Alone 2 one year later he is 10. In Home Alone 2 its made clear that its the following Christmas. This mistake has never come up before and I thought others would have noticed. Also, notice how calm the mother is considering her 8 year old is alone. Its amazing that the movie did as well as it did. It was a great film though. But, I wanted to point out that mistake with the age difference. How did he skip an age by the following Christmas. Home Alone is a year round film in my house.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Great movie!,"I know, this is one stupid story, but it's developed into a wonderful family film, as enjoyable as it is warmhearted. Mac Culkin is awesome in the lead. He really carries the film: he's got style, he's funny and he's even a good actor! Too bad his personal life screwed up, because he had the talent to become a grown-up movie star. The idiotic criminals are also really cool, because they cast good actors instead of some Ernest-style lame-o over-actors. Oscar-winner Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern (the narrator on The Wonder Years) are hilarious, but they also bring a bit more depth to what could have been cardboard characters. Pesci plays an aggressive thug, and anyone who's seen him in a Scorsese film knows how good he is at it. Stern plays a total dufus, and he's also really convincing at it. The film's humor might seem dumb, but hey, it's funny. John Hughes' screenplay has Kevin protecting his home by turning the thieves into human Wile E. Coyotes, and like the cartoon, it made me laugh. The gags might be old, but they're played with inventiveness, and the acting is always right. I just love this film, and you will too if you look beyond the fact that it's a family film.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A Classic Holiday Movie,"Home Alone is probably by far the best holiday comedy movie since Peter Billingsly in A Christmas Story, another holiday classic.The story of Home Alone is about a kid named Kevin McCallister(Macauly Culkin) who with his entire family are, going to France for the holidays. Kevin who is the youngest out of everyone in the house is often called by his brothers and sisters a ""disease.""  Anyway, one night, after his mom orders some pizza, he asks, ""Did anyone order a plain cheese?""  His older brother, Buz replies, ""Yeah, but if you want any, somebody's going to have barf it all up, now it's gone.""  Kevin his angry after discovering that Buz had purposely ate all the cheese pizza and gets into a fight with him.  When it's all over, everyone is mad at Kevin and sent to his room on the top floor for the night.  Later that night before going to sleep he says, ""I wish they would all just disappear.""Predictably, he wakes up the next morning to find everybody gone, not knowing that they had just left for the trip to France.  So this means party time for Kevin.  However, they're have been a string of burglaries by two partners in crime Harry(Joe Pesci) and Marv(Daniel Stern) (by the way are the best comic pair on screen) have set their sights on Kevin's house.  So this ultimately leads to their final showdown with Kevin setting his house full of traps so they can't get in.As I said before Home Alone is a must see holiday classic.  I'm 15 now.  I first saw it when I was 5 in the theater.  I must have laughed myself silly at Kevin's pranks.  Home Alone was followed by a less successful, but just as entertaining sequel, Home Alone 2: Lost In New York and a horrible third entry, Home Alone 3.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Revival of a great film,"I've recently decided to watch this film again and no matter how many times you see it, you simply cannot get bored of it. Every time you watch it, you will notice something you haven't seen before.This film is for all ages, it is a good film choice to watch with the family as there are many anecdotes and lines which will make adults laugh and there are bits of action that will send children in stitches. it flows very well, there is no fluff and you can make sense about what is going on, how things are going pretty much all the way throughout the film. I thought the cast was excellent, all the cast took their parts seriously but aside from Culkin, I think Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci deserve a lot of credit for playing two, idiotic and incompetent burglars who get their notorious reputation broken and humiliated because they get rumbled by many sets of booby traps that foil the bumbling bad guys. This film is a must see and not because I am rating it so highly, but because it is entertaining and comical for everyone of all ages",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The team work of Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern is just not insanely hilarious but it's also incredible that the two are so good together and I like how their scenes of punishment is followed right after the other! I think John Heard looks like Bruce Willis! I like Catherine O'Hara, she is a fine actress! Look for Larry Hankin and Roberts Blossom! John Williams has another great score here! This is a perfect movie for people to watch around Christmas and if you need a big laugh watch this as it will crack you up! Also, I strongly recommend Home Alone 2!

A holiday classic full of fun and heart,"""Home Alone"" is a timeless holiday classic that has captured the hearts of audiences since its release in 1990. Directed by Chris Columbus and written by John Hughes, the film stars Macaulay Culkin as Kevin McCallister, an eight-year-old boy who is accidentally left behind when his family goes on a Christmas vacation.Culkin delivers a standout performance as Kevin, whose initial fear of being alone quickly turns into excitement and resourcefulness. The film's charm lies in Kevin's clever and inventive ways of defending his home against two bumbling burglars, Harry and Marv, played hilariously by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. Their comedic antics and slapstick mishaps provide endless laughs and memorable moments.The movie also boasts a strong supporting cast, including Catherine O'Hara and John Heard as Kevin's frantic parents, and an unforgettable cameo by John Candy. The heartwarming subplot involving Kevin's neighbor, Old Man Marley, adds depth and emotion to the story, highlighting themes of family and forgiveness.John Williams' iconic score enhances the festive atmosphere, making ""Home Alone"" a quintessential holiday film. Its blend of humor, adventure, and heartfelt moments ensures it remains a favorite for all ages, year after year.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Keep the change, you filthy animal","Interestingly, Joe Pesci appeared here and in Goodfellas simultaneously. In this movie, he's also a bad guy, but his language is nothing worse than you would hear from Fred Fiintstone. The sequence with Pesci and Daniel Stern being outwitted by young Culkin is hilarious. Film critics have bashed this movie for being too violent. I disagree. The movie is cartonish, but cartoons tend to be violent, and are fun to watch for this reason. The high point of the movie is the exchange between Culkin and forbidding neighbor Roberts Blossom. Overall, a fun, heartwarming movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
