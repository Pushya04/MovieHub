A Punch In The Stomach,"I don't know why, but I went into the theater thinking I was about to see a female Rocky Balboa kind of deal. I left the theater in a daze. Overwhelmed by the simple truth of its conclusion. My hat to Clint Eastwood. What an extraordinary career. An artist of enormous proportions so well camouflaged behind a shy smile and a charming, clumsy attitude. I remember focusing on Clint Eastwood through a very different lens after sitting through ""Pale Rider"" a mythological, lyrical western. Actors love him because he, clearly, doesn't lie to them, doesn't kiss their asses. He quite simply gives them room to maneuver. Even someone like Meryl Streep, felt freer and capable to stretch herself all the way to Italy under his wing. Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Tim Robbins, Jude Law, Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman yes mostly men but there was also, other than Meryl Streep, Genevieve Boujold. Marcia Gay Harden, Laura Linney and now Hillary Swank with a performance that not even ""Boys don't Cry"" could predict. The film is a triumph in every department. My stomach ached from feeling. That's a compliment Mr. Eastwood. Thank you very much.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Superb!,"Clint Eastwood is a legendary film personality. I am a great fan of his. As an actor, I had my reservations with him, but as a storyteller, I have truly inhaled him. 'Million Dollar Baby' is amongst his finest films, a superb film, that almost reaches a Landmark level!About a hardened trainer/manager works with a determined woman in her attempt to establish herself as a boxer. 'Million Dollar Baby' begins with some humor, then it improves itself into becoming a motivational punch, but ends as a dry and depressing saga. I adored almost everything about the film, except the final 20-25 minutes. The culmination is very depressing. In fact, one just doesn't imagine it would have to end this way! But in all fairness, this one is a winner!Eastwood's understanding to the subject is objective and that's biggest plus point. Tom Stern's Cinematography is splendid. Joel Cox's editing is razor-sharp.In the acting department, Hilary Swank delivers a Knock-out performance. She is the life of the show. Morgan Freeman is wonderfully restrained. Eastwood's performance, is a pure of example, of apt multi-tasking. Jay Baruchel as Danger, is flawless. Anthony Mackie is his usual self. Brian F. O'Byrne is passable.On the whole, the list of accolades this 2004 flick received is truly unprecedented. It's got a legendary tag. From this writer, Thumbs Up!",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Swank gives the performance of a lifetime!,"I didn't view this film until today because I simply wasn't interested in women in boxing; however, I wish I'd seen it years ago! Hillary Swank can never make another film and this one would be her crowning glory. It takes you on a wild ride of emotions from the beginning and Clint Eastwood's curmudgeon self is part of it all. Naturally, the ""voice of God"" in Morgan Freeman is there to explain it all and give some meaning to what each of the characters fell. By now, everyone knows the ending but I still won't spoil it for late-comers to the film like myself. I do believe much has been made about it and it's unnecessary. Yes, you will be torn about what is morally right but you can certainly understand how Eastwood's and Swank's characters feel! Please see this film. You will understand pugilism more than ever before and you just might see some of your own self in the film! It is well worth the time!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
It's a knockout ...,"Flawlessly written, acted and directed, MILLION DOLLAR BABY is being hymned and wreathed by the critics as the best film of 2004. They're absolutely right. ""An old master's new masterpiece,"" the NEW YORK TIMES said in a review that was more of an open love letter to Eastwood than anything remotely resembling a critical analysis of the film itself. For once such honey-tongued critical adulation is fully merited. Dark, edgy, subtle and at times emotionally devastating, MILLION DOLLAR BABY represents the apotheosis of Eastwood's art - the most lucid and intelligently limned expression of his philosophy of the outsider, the noble loners whose personal codes of honour set them both above and apart from the compromised, corrupt societies they inhabit. The Boxing Ring As Metaphor For Life is a hoary trope almost as old as Hollywood itself, employed to varying effect in films as diverse as THE CHAMP, GOLDEN BOY, REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT, THE GREAT WHITE HOPE, FAT CITY, ROCKY and RAGING BULL. In MILLION DOLLAR BABY, though, Eastwood the director brings a fresh eye and an entirely fresh approach to both the setting and characterisations, virtually re-inventing this venerable sub-genre rather than simply recycling its conventions. Eastwood the actor is in fine form - a commanding if increasingly weather-beaten presence - as gym owner Frankie Dunn. A case study in loneliness, Dunn's creased face is a map of places you'd rather not go to and disappointment has clearly been a life-long companion. Co-stars Hilary Swank and the magnificent Morgan Freeman, playing Frankie's unlikely protegee Maggie Fitzgerald and friend ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, give what are without question the best performances of their respective careers: deftly underplayed, their roles provide emotionally overwhelming impacts more powerful than anything glimpsed in the film's riotous fight sequences. Forming an iron triangle forged from mutual dependence, Dunn and Dupris school the impulsive but untutored Maggie in both the techniques of boxing and the tradecraft of survival in a world pre-disposed to pulverise individualism. The canvas-floored square ring becomes the arena in which all three characters confront their various demons, battling for both victory and personal redemption. Paul Haggis' screenplay is itself a masterwork, improving on its source material without betraying the concise but compelling situations and superbly drawn characters found in F.X. Toole's short stories. And, finally, Eastwood the composer's elegiac but unobtrusive score is a minor classic of its kind, a requiem to both lost souls and lost causes. MILLION DOLLAR BABY is not only the best film released in 2004 it is also the most fully realised and richly textured major studio movie of the decade.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"as usual, clint is slow, but good","almost all of eastwoods directorial work seems above reproach (lets just not bring up blood work) but as much as i like the stories he tells, i wish he could just tell them a little faster. on the surface, they seem fairly conventional stories, not much new, but clint always has a way of getting at all the emotions hiding beneath the surface.i really like the noir like use of lighting & darkness , but sometimes the snail like pace does seem to drag a bit. I'm not gonna bother tellin ya the plot or the surprise, ill leave ya to discover that on your own, though if you're payin any attention at all, I'm sure you'll figure out what all the controversy has been about long before the end comes, though being predictable never feels like a flaw with eastwoods movies. its not the end that counts, its the trail ya walk to get there.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Excellent,"The movie is excellent. Hillary Swank deserves to receive the Oscar for her performance. I haven't seen much of her lately and am so glad that she was picked for this movie. She seems a natural for this role. Like she didn't even have to act, she just let her own emotions take charge. She stole every scene when she was on. Clint Eastwood is one heck of an actor and his directing of movies is even better. He is 75 years old and hope he has another 10 years of good movie making in him. Morgan Freeman is a great actor who never seems to receive the recognition he deserves. Tell others to see it because it isn't in the top 10 listing of viewed movies last week. I'm concerned the subject matter is too deep for most people and it will be pulled to make room for some lame-brain movie like Fat Albert.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Loved The Ride,"Million Dollar Baby is a movie about boxing like Braveheart is a movie about men in kilts riding horses. What it is is a movie to experience if you find yourself ever entertaining thoughts about loyalty, determination, talent, no talent, age, youth, courage, fear, fate, and the pain and joy of both living and dying.I read reviews of Million Dollar Baby and expected to like it. Roger Ebert can be soft on movies because he is plainly a big fan, but even he does not lightly toss around the M-word, masterpiece. Yet he drops it on MDB, and justly so. The story is simple and searing. A gal (Hilary Swank) with much heart and no experience aspires to be the champion of the world. She is Rocky in a sports bra. A grizzled fight trainer-manager/gym owner (Clint Eastwood) reluctantly takes her on. His best pal and wise-man assistant (Morgan Freemna) stands alongside them, as the plot unwinds steadily, seamlessly, picking up speed, scene by scene, act after act. Eastwood and Freeman are artists at the top of their profession and they, along with the brilliant Swank, present you the very worthy lives of three people you will care about and remember. The arena is boxing, but it might as well have been boating or baking. It is a story about values and truths that far exceed sports and movies. I walked into the Lowes Lincoln Square theater last night knowing Million Dollar Baby was taking me on a ride and willing to hop aboard. What a beautiful, memorable ride it was.",,Anonymous,Drama
Swank! Eastwood! Freeman!,"It would be difficult to imagine a more perfect trio of performers the likes of Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood, and Morgan Freeman in their respective roles in the emotionally-charged ""Million Dollar Baby.""My favorite scenes were the early sequences in which Maggie (Swank) visits the dowdy boxing gym and co-opts Eastwood's crusty boxing trainer Frankie into becoming her mentor. Along with the veteran, retired boxer Eddie, played by Freeman, the performances were as electric as the Ali shuffle.In the overall arc of the story of ""Million Dollar Baby,"" there were three extraneous subplots: (1) Frankie's visits to church and his talks with the priest; (2) the story of the mentally-challenged young man named Danger, who appears in the gym and is taunted by the boxers; and (3) Maggie's family members introduced in two scenes filled with such vulgarity that much of the film's hard-earned credibility was lost. Not only would the film have worked effectively without the subplots, it would have been a much better film without them.While Eastwood's direction was superb, much credit should also go to the designers, especially the stylish work with lighting. I cannot recall a film as dimly lit as this one, and the subdued lighting contributed substantially to the characters and mood evoked in this sensitive film. The three main performances were standouts. But this film was also a very successful team effort.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Clint, I love you","I've been infatuated with Clint Eastwood from the time I saw his first spaghetti western when I was a teenager. I've seen all the movies he's starred in and directed. And I've seen his skills as a storyteller develop, mature and grow. Throughout this period the infatuation remained constant and re-assuring. But today, after viewing 'Million Dollar Baby', I'm totally and completely in love with this man. Clint, his movie, Freeman and Swank deserve to win Oscars in every category for this film. He is a Master of his craft. I want him stick around and do it again and again!.And I'm in love Hilary too!. She does not act - she becomes!.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Inspirational and hard-hitting*no pun intended*,"Of course, I must see ""THE BEST PICTURE OF 2004!"", I think every movie fanatic has too. Man, cry me a river, this was a good movie! I have to admit, I had my doubts. I'm not really into boxing movies, exception: Raging Bull. But so many people told me that this was a great movie and it was. Hilary Swank, what a performance! This movie makes you feel as if anything can happen. ""I got what I needed"" she says to Clint Eastwood. Clint and Hilary together were absolutely perfect. They made a great team. Clint really did a great job expressing his doubts at first but believing in Hilary, it was truly inspirational.Morgan Freeman is a remarkable actor. I'M SO HAPPY HE WON FINALLY! Even though I feel sometimes his roles are typical, he's the disrespected man, but has knowledge and helps people, he's really good at it.I really enjoyed this movie, but just to let you know, it is a tear jerker. So you might want to have a box of Kleenex next to you. This is a wonderful film that everyone should watch. You'll feel better after you watch it, I know that sounds silly, but I'm sure that everyone else who watched it will agree with me.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Good acting but generally overrated,"I wanted to like this movie, especially since I am a fan of Clint Eastwood as a director and Hilary Swank as an actress. The previews didn't interest me at all - but the almost universal praise heaped on this film did make me want to see it.I agree with the reviewer who said the film felt ""scripted"" - not only that, but watching scenes (near the beginning) with Clint and Morgan were like watching people ""act"" and ""play the scene"". Hilary Swank saves the day with her performance, believable and truthful. Clint's work later in the film is exemplary. Morgan Freeman is, well, Morgan Freeman, and here he plays simply a variation on his ""Driving Miss Daisy"" character, mumbling through some scenes making his words incomprehensible.I didn't feel an emotional connection to this film at all - I don't see it as ""Clint's masterpiece"" at all - ""Mystic River"" is a far superior film, which had me extremely emotionally involved. The Morgan Freeman voice-over really got on my nerves very early on. I am not a fan of voice-over - I believe it's an easy way out of explaining things rather than SHOWING them.I can't understand all the hype about MDB - I really can't. I give it (a very generous) 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Not hard enough,"This is the fifth best film of Clint Eastwood, the expert director of cinema. No matter how much we watch this movie, we cannot get enough. But this is not the proof that this movie is perfect. The completeness of this film happens when the reality in the situation it is in is harder, crueler and more crushing.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Old fashioned boxing story with a modern twist,"Eastwood plays the owner of a gym where fighters train. Hillary Swank is a 31 year old waitress trying to become a fighter. At first Eastwood discourages her due to her age and lack of technique, but soon he is training her and she starts to have some success. The relationship becomes much more than that of a trainer and fighter as she takes the place of the daughter who won't speak to him and he takes the place of her family that only cares about what's in it for them. A tragedy occurs that causes Swank to ask Eastwood for a favor he feels he cannot grant.This won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 2004, but there is nothing particularly unique or compelling about it that would have caused it to beat out its competition in the Oscar race that year other than the fact that it circumstantially paralleled another story that was making headlines at the same time that the academy was voting - that of Terry Schiavo and the Herculean efforts by first the state of Florida, then the president and Congress, at keeping Terry's feeding tube from being removed when she had likely been in a vegetative state for fifteen years. The incident caused lots of people to write medical directives so that they could lessen the chance of becoming a medical wishbone and political football themselves.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Million Dollar Baby Is A Knockout!,"Clint Eastwood always explores the darker side of human nature and the duality of man. His dark hero of Unforgiven, William Munny, tries to repent only to be thrust back into that violent world he knows so well. His regretful Frank Horrigan of In The Line Of Fire and his womanizing Steve Everett of True Crime also want redemption.Eastwood's Frankie Dunn of Million Dollar Baby is the most conflicted, weathered, and vulnerable he's ever played. When he weeps in a darkened church it's like watching a house of cards begin to fall. This is a man whose had a regretful past and can't run away from the curve balls life has thrown at him. Frankie Dunn is like most of us where we eventually get punished for our good deeds.The funny thing is that Million Dollar Baby is not a boxing movie despite the way it's being advertised like a female version of Rocky. Yes, Hilary Swank's Maggie trains to be a boxer under the guidance of Clint Eastwood's Frankie Dunn. Yes, Morgan Freeman is Scrap, Frankie's tough friend and ex boxer. Yes, the bulk of it takes place in a boxing gym. Yes, there are numerous boxing matches. Despite all this it's still not a boxing movie.When you see it you'll be surprised by the utter humanity in the piece. This film runs very deep and you will care for the three main characters. Eastwood gives us something we rarely get in films today. He gives us real people.The film is about the triumph of the human spirit, the emotional world we try to hide from that eventually sucks us all in, our compassionate hearts, and the difficult decisions we face when it comes to those we care about. It's about friendship, trust, and the bonds of the heart that are unavoidable. It is a true masterpiece.Hilary Swank is all fire and guts as Maggie. Her intensity and commitment has guided her to another Academy Award. She knows she's poor, she accepts it, and she pushes forward despite her limitations. This is not to say she can't be hurt. We watch her eyes well up a few times and truly feel her pain despite the fact that she is as tough as they come. Morgan Freeman, who finally won a long overdue and well deserved Oscar, plays Scrap with the perfect combination of toughness and compassion. He knows the situation from every angle and his narration of the film rings true.See this film. It deserves it's accolades because it's about real characters and it's directed with honesty, warmth, and true pain. Clint Eastwood gets better with age and his films reflect the days of real movie making. The sets are simple, the characters are complex, and the story moves in a pace closer to real life than any other director could reach. Eastwood has been called the Hemingway of Film making. You don't get more real than that. It was great seeing this natural storyteller take home his second Oscar for Best Director and Picture.",,Anonymous,Drama
A Story of Redemption,"When you make a film with characters, true characters, you have won half the battle. The characters in this film are on a crash course with emptiness, until they find each other. The tired, stagnant life of the Clint Eastwood fight manager, Morgan Freeman, who has sold his needs to watch his friend, and, of course, Hillary Swank, who is trying to find someplace to keep her from ending up like her trailer trash family. If one were to simply look at the plot, it would seem pretty trite. Girl wants to be a fighter (a contemporary possibility; her gender really isn't important), manager hasn't had a fighter in years (he is a curmudgeon who sees the negative in things), and the talent will out. But then the element of tragedy rears its ugly head, and the plot becomes more complex. But it is the characterization that wins the day. We get to know and love these three people (actually a fourth; a young boxer who continues to get the crap beat out of him but who provides another example of what we should be. It is, of course, ultimately about love: love for self, love for others, and love for why we are put on this earth. I was really moved by this film. It is a masterpieces of redemption and will. It is about victory through pain.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Genuine emotions!,"Or at least it seems like genuine emotions in this masterpiece of a film which incidentally is Eastwood's best drama so far and considering how good Mystic River is that's saying something. The storytelling is both fluent and well paced and all actors involved deliver some of their best work so far which is mainly because Eastwood is so good at bringing out the best in his actors. I think people who have watched this film and Mystic River will agree. Eastwood is a no-nonsense story teller and cuts right through to the bone which means that there aren't many subplots and this is a really good thing in this film because the main story doesn't need a large number of subplots to steal away attention. Also at a running length of 2 hours the film would undoubtedly have been too long if Eastwood had added any more subplots.The acting is as mentioned earlier very, very good. Clint chose to appear in this film himself as he does in many of the films he directs but there is something different about him this time around. Eastwood isn't known as a director who pours his soul out on the screen but in this film he seems to add a few emotions to his range of acting. He is still a tough guy as can be heard from his voice but he is also just a vulnerable old man with an estranged daughter. Its hard to write about his performance without spoiling the film so I'll just say this: This is his most well rounded character to date in spite of the fact that it seems a little far fetched that Eastwood would want to learn Gaelic. Hilary Swank won an Oscar for her performance in this film and in my opinion it was well earned. She plays her character in a way so the character becomes almost instantly likable and you cannot help but root for her. This ability to draw the audience in and make them feel is very rare but Swank seems to have mastered it. Overall her performance is impressive. The last notable actor is of course Morgan Freeman who finally won his Oscar. He brings his usual authority and authenticity to the character and while he is ""only"" a supporting character in this film he definitely puts his signature on it with some very moving scenes. The rest of the cast is decent but as the emphasis is on the three mentioned above there is no reason to talk about them further.The script is rather simple but its simplicity is a quality mark. The film takes you in one direction only to take a twist and turn into something completely different and as the audience had just gotten used to the direction the film was going the twist seems like a genuine shock. I'm not telling what the twist is you're just going to have to watch the film and find out for yourself. The dialog is both witty and intelligent and above all it seems real. Believable. And because of the first class acting it feels even better. When I say that the dialog seems real in fact I mean the entire film seems real. Genuine. Everything from the acting to the atmosphere is highly believable and real even though Swank's character's family and the character of Danger lean ever so slightly towards caricature.The film really managed to draw me in and I felt with and for the characters of the film. The characters are the driving factor of the film and luckily the actors who portray them are skilled enough to make them seem real. Eastwood outdid himself in the drama genre with this film which is undoubtedly one of his best. It doesn't seem fair to compare the film to Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo (or The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) as they are very different films in terms of genre and target group.Million Dollar Baby is undoubtedly one of the best films of 2004 and is deserving of the Oscar it received in the Best Film category as well as the other Oscars it was awarded.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
a knockout punch,"I grew up watching Clint Eastwood as Rowdy Yates on ""Rawhide."" Who could have imagined, looking at his unlined face and watching his easygoing manner, that he would ever have developed into the filmmaker that he has? Though we should have known Clint was something special - in those days, it was nearly impossible to move from a hit TV show into films, as the typecasting was even worse than it is today. But Clint did it.Unfortunately for me, I knew the plot and ending of this film before walking into the theater. Because of the staggered release of MDB, it was almost impossible not to. I would have liked to assess the impact not knowing the twists and turns of the plot.That being said, I found this a beautifully-realized story about dreams, courage, and the true meaning of family.The three principals did a tremendous job. Hillary Swank is so much more than an actress. She is able to break a role down down to its simplest elements and becomes the character. There is never anything overdone in her work. She is one of the finest actresses we have. Morgan Freeman is one of the finest actors we have. And Clint Eastwood? Well, he's just one of the finest directors we have.

"A beautiful, poetic modern masterpiece.","I've seen this 4 or 5 times now since its' release. There are a few films that I hold most dear, that I can relate to on a profound level. This is one of them. I defy anyone not to get something out of this movie.It's truly powerful, poignant and elegantly performed by a wonderful cast. It touches my soul so deeply it's quite difficult to express. Even on the 4th or 5th viewing, the screenplay reaches deep into your chest, yanks out your heart, slams it on the ground and stamps on it over and over 'til it is pulverised. But it achieves this heartbreak so organically and genuinely, without being contrived or manipulative. Just like life itself.It's simply a great story, brought to life by one of the great directors of our time. A masterfully assembled work of art that I love, nearly as much as Frankie adores his ""Cuishle"".",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Three excellent central performances elevate a clichéd story,"Clint Eastwood must have gotten soft in his old age. While this isn't necessarily a criticism, MILLION DOLLAR BABY walks a fine line between emotionally powerful drama and sappy, overly sentimental melodrama. Fortunately despite the predictable plotting and cliché dialogue, it has a trio of excellent performances that keep it out of the kitchen sink. Front and center is Hilary Swank as Maggie, a down-on-her-luck waitress who aspires to be a boxer. Her performance is what really makes the film work due to her irrepressible spirit and down-home charm. Clint Eastwood also does an admirable job as Frankie Dunn, who reluctantly (""I don't train girls"") takes a role as Maggie's trainer, manager, and mentor. And then there's Morgan Freeman, one of Frankie's former fighters, and who also co-runs a gym with him. I will admit that his presence in the film adds some depth as he is a connection to Frankie's past, but I didn't feel like he was integral to the story. Still, he had one of the film's best scenes when he shows that despite losing an eye (and being old), that he still has ""it"" in the ring. Beyond these three central performances, the film seems content to stick to the tired sports movie formula of having a older mentor train a younger up-and-comer, at least for the first 3/4. Despite the film having been out now for over 10 years, I still won't give away the sharp turn the story takes. At that point the film becomes something else which is more obviously heavy-handed and didn't quite work for me. It also doesn't help that the film strongly hints at the outcome very early on, robbing it of a lot of the emotional impact. And that is actually my biggest problem with the film. Not content to let the performances and story stand on their own, Paul Haggis (a producer/co-writer) insists on holding the audience's hand throughout the entire film. It didn't work for me in CRASH, and didn't really work for me here either. Still, Clint Eastwood manages to elevate the material to the point where I didn't hate myself for watching it. Overall, the three central performances are enough to loosely recommend this film, but just be aware that it is somewhat heavy-handed and relies a little too much on genre clichés.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Million Dollar Baby: 9/10,"Million Dollar Baby is propaganda by the baby-killing liberals. As is every movie dealing with a controversial issue, especially ones made by those ultra-liberal people at Warner Bros. and that staunch Democrat Clint Eastwood. It seems like the only part of movies people talk about is the ending, even in crappy movies. Supposedly, prints of Hide and Seek were sent out without the final reel, so no one would know the ending until the time came (as if anyone cared). Remember the furor around The Sixth Sense's ending? Everyone knows it now, and if you're not careful, you'll uncover the ending to Million Dollar Baby-a true shocker, if there ever was one. It's unexpected, realistic, and powerful. Try getting that from Hide and Seek.Hilary Swank (in what is sure to be her second Best Actress Oscar role) is Maggie Fitzgerald, a trailer-park wanna-be boxer who joins up in has-been Frankie Dunn's (Clint Eastwood) gym. Frankie has somewhat of a misogynist attitude, but agrees to train her, anyway. She rises through the circuits of boxing very quickly, and, although reluctantly, Frankie starts to admit that she's a good boxer.Before I saw Baby, I thought for sure the Academy would finally give the best director award to Martin Scorsese for his mediocre work in The Aviator. But now, I think Eastwood's almost a shoo-in for Best Director. Eastwood frames each shot carefully, and creates the most drama possible from each one. Something that really stood out for me was his use of color. Oftentimes bleak, but always for a purpose, to elict some sort of feeling from the audience. Eastwood uses the minimum of, well, everything possible to make the mood as dreary and unwasteful as possible. And, much like Raging Bull (directed by Eastwood's current rival), the boxing scenes are completely realistic. Except you can tell Eastwood didn't cheat at all (like Scorsese probably did), as this movie is full color, and the boxing scenes build up so much tension it's almost impossible to believe. Million Dollar Baby has both that and the dramatic quality, which ranks it up with the top films of 2004.The bigger question at hand is this: whodathunk that within five years, a relatively unknown actress will have had two roles of a lifetime and win best actress in five years. Swank was amazing (although not as amazing as Chloe Sevigny, who was robbed) as Brandon Teena/Teena Brandon in Boys Don't Cry, but better here in Million Dollar Baby. Her character is so determined, such a strong spirit basically rising from nothing, and Swank portrays Maggie extremely well. I guess she'll make Annette Bening lose again this year.Is Million Dollar Baby the best picture of the year? No, mainly because in the last twenty or thirty minutes, it just drags on and on. The message and plot are clear, yet it continues to reiterate it over and over again. We know that the person wants to do something, and another person doesn't want that to happen, but seriously, do we need that extra fifteen minutes of no substance? That's the only complaint I have with this strong, strong movie. What's even better is that it's PG-13, meaning anyone can see it, which they should.My rating: 9/10 Rated PG-13 for violence, some disturbing images, thematic material and language.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Spoilers!  Fun at times, suffers from clichés and maudlin ending","SPOILER ALERT! I enjoyed the cinematography. The gym looked great. Hilary Swank was good and the banter between Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood was highly engaging- but reminiscent of many ""buddies"" from many different movies. There was little original here.The strange character of Danger was, well, strange. In the end he seemed to exist primarily so A) Eastwood could say grumpy things about him thus appearing to be gruff and lovable at the same time, and B) so Morgan Freeman could have a moment of glory when he punches out Danger's tormentor. I didn't mind these moments in the plot, but we must admit that they are not the stuff of genius. Disney provided countless similar moments in their live action movies of the seventies (See the Herbie series).The boxing was utterly unbelievable for anyone who has actually watched boxing. However it was amusing to see Hilary knock out boxer after boxer much to her coach's- Clint's- exasperation.The final opponent- the evil woman who cheats and knocks Hilary out- would surely have been suspended several times based on the behavior depicted in the film. This might not be obvious to everyone- but boxing is not professional wrestling.Hilary's family is so ridiculously evil that I have to laugh when I remember them. The scenes of Hilary sitting by the hospital window day after day while her family went to Disneyland were painful- but not in the way they were meant to be.The final scenes seem like a vote for euthanasia and I felt a little ripped off. There is a great deal that's implausible in these scenes. Where does Clint find the needle and the drugs? How does he know what to do? Why don't the nurses on duty catch on? Why isn't there an investigation? But even more importantly- there was no need for the secrecy. As far as I understand, Hilary needed to be on a ventilator or she would die. There is no law that says you have go on a ventilator- at least not in the province where I live. She could have requested to be removed from the machine and died peacefully, without Clint's apparent heroics.Overall, very disappointing for a movie that was so hyped by critics. There was nothing outstanding about it. What was fun was far from original. What was bad was so bad that it seriously cripples the whole thing.I can't imagine why intelligent critics loved it in such large numbers. Had this movie been released in February, I believe many people would have cooled toward it by the time Oscar season rolled around. Now I fear it may displace superior movies at the awards show, causing future critics and fans to scratch their heads.",3.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Best boxing film since ""Raging Bull""?","Clint Eastwood is a man of faith. He is an artist who is confident and experienced enough to have a deep faith in the audience that he is trying to reach. He is also a master of omission, of the left-out detail/line, trusting in his gut that his audience is willing to participate in his films by exercising their imaginations; that they never want any aspect of the story to be 'dumbed-down' for ready consumption. In fact, his trust in the audience to use their own minds to fill in gaps is like a gift of part ownership in the film. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a beautiful gift, and a masterpiece if film-making.Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, an elder boxing coach, manager, and expert 'cut man' who runs a gym and is learning Gaelic on the side. He's a nice enough guy, but he can't seem to shake the guilt from ghosts in his past (some we're in on, some not quite). His guilt/shame is a constant just beneath the surface and gives him something of a cold exterior, sometimes frozen. Yet, as played by Eastwood, you know Dunn's aware of his own plight, but just doesn't know how to melt the ice. Or more importantly, if he's deserving of such a meltdown.Enter Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank). She's a thirty-something trailer trash woman from southwest Missouri. An unlikely hero for sure. But for my money, Maggie is this generation's Rocky. That may seem an easy, simplistic, and over-reaching comparison, but the parallels are deep, obvious and myriad. Like many people, Maggie's dream (being a professional boxer) is always just out of reach, yet she cannot give it up. She works as a waitress to make ends meet (or at least the ends are almost touching), but spends all her spare time training. Like Dunn, Maggie has her own ghosts haunting her, and through these ghosts they bond tighter than super glue. The heart and work (incalculably huge amounts) that Swank put into becoming Maggie are unnoticeable. It's a silly phrase but it's as if she was born to play this part. It fits like a glove. The real life parallel of her relationship to Eastwood no doubt played a part in her ability to connect with the character's relationship to Dunn. Yet this in no way diminishes her accomplishment. She is brilliant.Morgan Freeman plays Dunn's right-hand man (Scrape) at the gym, and reprises a role similar to Red from ""Shawshank Redemption"". He also voices the omniscient narration to the story, a la Red. Like Dunn and Maggie, he's similarly bruised, but somehow less deeply. He's there when both of them need support and helps to bring them together. I can think of nobody acting in film today who can embody kindness and wisdom through friendship and support better than Freeman. He also serves to bring in another Eastwood trademark – 'Banter'. Even when themes are heavy, Eastwood's sense of humor is never entirely absent and he and Freeman have a good time with each other, as did Bacon and Fishburne in ""Mystic River"". These three characters together create a beautiful and true, albeit small, family unit Eastwood's lifelong themes and 'blurring of lines' are on full display: good vs. evil, right vs. wrong, the role of violence, redemption, guilt/shame over previous acts, even god and death. Never one for easy answers, his version of the truth lies in the shadows, quite literally. Cinematographer Tom Stern crafts characters in shadow, shifting in and out of light. There is a grey area between the light and the dark where something approaching truth lies waiting, and this is where Eastwood takes us, then leaves us there to ponder. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a shadow play. As accomplished as ""Unforgiven"" and ""Mystic River"", yet even more personal, this film is a triumph of human storytelling. As Bacon's character says in ""Mystic River"", ""and the hits just keep on comin'.""",,Anonymous,Drama

"""Million Dollar Baby"" is A Compelling Daram","""Million Dollar Baby"" is a very compelling drama. Clint Eastwood has directed a very controversial masterpiece. He portrays the retired boxer and now trainer, Frankie Dunn. He has not seen his estranged daughter, Katie, in years. He persists in writing to her weekly, but he never receives a response. He is associated with Morgan Freeman's character, Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris, also retired and suffering from the loss of his right eye from an earlier fight. The real star of this picture is Hilary Swank who gives a very believable performance of a moderately young female boxer to be. She aches to be trained by Eastwood's character, and finally earns the right to do so. The emotional and complex ending is too overwhelming to describe in this brief epistle, and one should not spoil it for the viewing public. Suffice it to say that you should bring your box of tissue, and chew on the meat of this drama for a long time after it is ended on the screen. It deserves as many thumbs up as it can get.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
exquisite and delicate work of art,"Usually there is so much hoopla surrounding films that come at the end of the year, and 80% of them are disappointing when they finally screen. Some of them flying by in colorful shells with technical wizardry but little emotion. Others manage to touch the soul and teach us how to confront the wonderful mystery of life. Eastwood has put together a sensitive study of damaged souls and hope. He gives an opportunity to appreciate life and not to give up in the pursuit of our of dreams.Eastwood, Swank, and the always wonderful Freeman move effortlessly and interact with each other with fantastic precision and grace. It is hard not to think of them as fantastic performers and give them their much deserved dues. In an era when people are so fascinated with quick flashes and light analysis of important material, comes a small film that envelops and doesn't let you go. In my second viewing I felt I discovered more of its richness and grew to appreciate it even more. I truly hope that when Academy Awards (which supposedly honor the most accomplished work of the year), the acting, direction, and every other aspect of this film is recognized accordingly. There has been other phenomenal work out this year, most in small films. Don't let this be a make up year or a year that will eventually be recognized by ""should have been"" remarks.

"A Tour De Force for Freeman, Swank, and Eastwood","While much has been said for the performances of all three actors, Morgan Freeman steals the show in many ways. His performance here is as powerful as his work in ""Shawshank Redemption."" Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood subtly pull you in close to their characters. Watching their performances was like watching a well choreographed dance. As celluloid art, this film shines brightly, but the movie also serves as a great platform for discussion of very personal and profound life issues. This movie may not appeal to those who go to movies simply to be entertained or to see ""a heartwarming story,"" although in many untraditional ways, the story is heartwarming and moving. When I left the theater, my mind and heart was satisfied and my thoughts were challenged. Definitely worth watching!",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Probably wouldn't crack my top 50 of 2004,"I don't understand all the praise. Sure, it's a pretty good movie, but it's flat, obvious, and not at all memorable. Eastwood's last film, Mystic River, was ten times better. Hilary Swank plays a boxer who persists in trying to get trainer Clint Eastwood to make her his student. He finally does accept her, especially after his friend, Morgan Freeman, who works as a janitor in his gym, convinces him of her talent. Most of the movie is a pretty straightforward boxing drama. Swank and Eastwood become each other's surrogate father and daughter, both making up for lost loved ones (Swank's father is dead, and Eastwood's daughter refuses to talk to him). The final act adds a tearjerker. There is also a poorly developed subplot about a few of the regulars at Eastwood's gym. It's slow, but mostly entertaining. Swank is good, but nowhere near the level that she hit with Boys Don't Cry. It's impossible to believe that Eastwood got nominated, especially over Paul Giamatti for Sideways. His direction is fine, but he can barely speak. Plus, he's so old it looks like his skeleton is trying to escape from his body. Morgan Freeman isn't especially great in his supporting role. He can't speak clearly, either. He narrates the film, and it can often be very hard to understand him. Million Dollar Baby is worth seeing, but it certainly isn't award-worthy. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
How can a movie or a cast be any better?,"2005 has started off with a big big bang for my wife and I. Million Dollar baby is a sure fire Acadamey Award nominee in several categories and how can you possibly choose who and what should win. Everything about this movie from the writing, directing, acting and even the music by Clint Eastwood is brilliant. Hillary Swank is once again one of our best actresses.. Don't know why she doesn't make more movies and do some as a ""real lady"" which she certainly is. Her portrayal as a white trash girl from the sticks who wants to be a boxing champion is very believable and she is perfect in the role. The chemistry between her and the fabulous Clint Eastwood who I believe is past 70 years old is wonderful. Clint is simply great in anything that he does, from those old spaghetti westerns, to Dirty Harry to the comedies, acting, directing, singing, you name it and he can do it as good as anyone else. He is a fall back to the greats of Hollywood goneby. What can you say about Morgan Freeman. I can listen to his voice for hours and be satisfied. He is mesmerizing with his tones. As an actor, he too is so versatile and fantastic that he has not gotten the appreciation that he should be getting. He is one of the finest actors in Hollywood who just goes along making movie after movie and each one is of the top caliber. He is great as the go between with Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank in this movie and he does it with such ease. I would love to see him finally get the recognition he deserves by not only getting nominated but actually winning the academy award which he so richly deserves.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Female ""Rocky"" with a downbeat and contradictory close","Released in 2004 and directed by Clint Eastwood, ""Million Dollar Baby"" stars Eastwood as a cantankerous boxing trainer who owns a working class gym in Los Angeles, which is maintained by one of his former boxers, the narrator of the story (Morgan Freeman). A waitress from the sticks of Missouri (Hilary Swank) shows up and asks that Frankie (Eastwood) train her, which he refuses to do because she's too old at 32 and he ""doesn't train girls,"" probably because he had an unexplained falling out with his daughter years earlier. Eventually he begrudgingly agrees.The bulk of the film is basically a female version of ""Rocky"" (1976), except that I prefer the potent drama in this one. The three main characters are well fleshed-out with an all-around reverent tone, not to mention an occasional bit of mild amusement. Frankie and Maggie (Swank) slowly develop a father/daughter-type relationship and it's touching.The third act, however, takes a left turn that is seriously downbeat. It departs from sports movie formula with a message that contradicts everything the first two acts pushed, which is inexplicable. Sure, I 'get' the point: A certain person basically sacrifices everything to do what's (supposedly) best for the situation and honor the will of a dearly loved soul. Nevertheless, it's a dark turn that leaves a sour taste because it refutes the positive message of the first two-thirds of the story.The film runs 2 hours, 12 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles.GRADE: B-/C+",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Sure to be a contender for the Academy's Best Picture of the Year,"Saw ""Million Dollar Baby"" in Manhattan last night. Clint Eastwood, one of the all-time most famous actors -- and directors -- has more than enough money where he could choose to pull the strings on block-buster, mindless action pictures, ala Jerry Bruckheimer, or comic books. Or, hell, in his twilight years he could just lay back and enjoy his millions. But no. He has chosen instead to make quieter, lower-budget, heart-felt, character driven films like ""The Unforgiven"" ""True Crime"" ""Mystic River"" and now Million Dollar Baby. And the world is a better place for it. Eastwood uses his multiple talents to make films that have something valuable to say. In the emotionally powerful, Million Dollar Baby, he tells an allegorical tale of boxing to subtly express themes of hope, redemption, sacrifice, persistence, and belief in one's self. The movie emphasizes that failure is a more honorable and personally fulfilling trait than never having tried, while also frowning upon laziness and leeching off others. But see the movie and judge for yourself. I personally consider great films as the ones where I leave the theater with a better understanding of human nature, or a desire to improve the world by even a little bit. Eastwood's latest more than succeeds on those counts.",,Anonymous,Drama
One of the year's best,"Clint Eastwood just won't give up. Like good wine, the older - the better, Clint just keeps delivering unforgettable moments to movie lovers willing to grasp his world of human heart. ""Million dollar baby"" is not a movie for everyone. Many people will see it just because the trailer looks like one of the sequels in ""Rocky"" franchise, the only difference for boxer being a girl. How wrong. The first half of this masterpiece gives us a graceful insight into the lives of our heroes, all carrying some sort of emotional/physical wounds. Just when you think the movie is slipping into cliché' territory of Mr. Eastwood makes a U-Turn and the next moment you're embarrassed for even coming up with the thought. Pure and simple this is a film about friendship, redemption, value of life, perseverance and above all love. Love in this film is stronger than religion, stronger than life itself, stronger than all the secular things. Eastwood shows us that love is God, however cruel his works may seem. Performances are pure brilliance : Hilary Swank shows once more that she is probably the greatest actress of younger generation. If there is justice, she will bag another Oscar. Eastwood adds such a depth to the thick-skinned but fragile Frankie Dunn that I cant't see anyone else doing it better. Morgan Freeman is exquisite as well. His soothing voice as a narrator and a mere glance at his face blows you away. For anyone who's looking for moving emotion in a movie and not just 2 hours of popcorn fun, this is a gem not to be missed. Back to back with ""Mar adentro"", ""Million dollar baby"" is the best movie of 2004!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

A Deeply Disturbing, and depressing,boxing movie, and it may just be the best film i have ever seen!. The Performances, are incredible, just incredible,, and all 3 of them deserve Oscars, especially Swank!. It's Moving, touching, disturbing and extremely sad. You grow so attached to Swank's character, since she is so incredibly likable, and what happens to her is not right!. Hillary and Clint's Chemistry is simply amazing, they had a special bond,as for Maggie's Mother, You will hate her, , and want to slap her silly, for being such a bitch. However it depressed me big time, and it's not easy to watch (2nd half anyway). there are lots and lots of disturbing images, that will haunt you , trust me., In fact The whole 2nd half is haunting. The Direction is absolutely, incredible. Clint Eastwood, is brilliant behind the camera, nothing fancy, but the film does not need it, still it's brilliant, all the way!.And that score, is simply awesome!. The Acting Is absolutely incredible,with No Doubt Oscar winning performances from, Swank, Eastwood,Freeman.

Clint Eastwood, is just as good, he is an incredible actor, his character is meant to be rough, and gruff, but he really has a heart of a gold and i enjoyed the special bond/chemistry him and Hillary had.Morgan Freeman is absolutely, fantastic here as always, and was a great narrator, plus, i loved his character. Jay Baruchel, is good as Danger, and was harmless, plus he gave me a few good chuckles.

The acting was amazing, and Hilary Swank's character was so believable! I laughed and cried throughout the movie...and the story of the young woman's life was so incredible I wasn't surprised of the great reviews it received. I want to sob just thinking about it! I of course had to tell all my friends about it, and now we all want to see it together. I can't describe how touching this movie was, and I know that sounds cheesy, but it's really true. It seemed to make me forget everything going on in my hectic life for just long enough to indulge in the rare and beautiful story of a poor woman with nothing but hope and determination to be the best she can. Her innocence and sweetness adds so much to the plot. Also, Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman are awesome.. I recommend this movie to anyone, just have a box of tissues ready!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

The character's developed throughout the film and the actor's portrayal of them made the characters believable.

What I like the most is the lack of special effects and the total concentration on the development of the story. Borrowing from Roger Ebert: Thumbs Way UP!",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Top performance by Eastwood,"Lint Eastwood gives the performance of his career even better than his other Oscar nominated performance in ""Unforgiven."" His voice hasn't been raspier and we've never seen him so bare in character. His scene that proves the worthiness of the performance is his scene when he's in the church crying. There's no performance in 2004 that shows more nakedness and more emotion than that of Eastwood's. Hilary Swank also gives a performance worth remembering. Her character of Maggie is entirely lovable and believable at all times throughout the film. You love her from the very second you get your eyes on her. The real triumph of her performance is the entire last 1/3 of the film. From the moment of her being paralyzed you feel every bit of pain she feels and every tear she sheds you shed with her. She completely embodied herself into the character. Despite the breathtaking performance I still wouldn't give her the Oscar for the 2nd time. The nomination nonetheless was very well deserved. Morgan Freeman was one of the most overdue actors working today prior to ""Million Dollar Baby."" The performance was very good but not one of his best. His win was a celebration of all his fantastic films that went unnoticed by the Academy. (The Shawshank Redemption, Driving Miss Daisy, Street Smart) He is a very talented man showing many ranges in his impressive career from drama to comedy and back to drama again. You can't help but love ""Scrap."" Every line Freeman delivers in the film either gets a laugh or just utterly scene stealing from his co-stars Eastwood and Swank. If it wasn't for his overdue status going into the Oscars I wouldn't of gave him the Oscar. If were going on solely performance Clive Owen from ""Closer"" definitely out-did him. Nonetheless Freeman's impressive career made him the prime candidate of winning his long overdue Oscar. Clint Eastwood directs this film to utter perfection. Its dark lighting gave the exact mood of each scene and beautiful musical score is remarkable. He is truly one of the most gifted people in Hollywood.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

simply terrific,"I watched this awesome movie last night on TV, and I could not stop crying for half an hour: its greatness and emotional power are really something rare and precious. It is simply incredible how the genius of Clint Eatwood was able to go beyond the physical violence of a boxing story and make it an astonishing metaphor of life. The mysterious and simple truth about life and death are so plainly but deeply concentrated in two hours.Respecting and protecting yourself, distinguishing between the moment you have to fight and the one you have to wait, searching for the great shot of a lifetime, always recognizing one's limits, suffering till the utmost to prove one's strength, standing up after being knocked down but accepting defeat as part of life, enjoying success, but realizing that fair play is not always rewarded, and in the end, feeling when the game is over, for good: this both boxing and life teach. Also faith, however fragile and doubtful, plays a significant role, Frankie goes to mass every day to expiate some guilt of his past life, he needs to believe in something beyond man, although not being fully convinced and although there comes a time in everyone's life when you are alone with your conscience and no one but yourself can make the right decision (the priest, too, knows that religious teachings do not always go hand in hand with the troubles of life).As the movie approached the end I seemed not to be able to stand the strong emotional engagement, I felt like changing the channel, but I did not, obviously, since it is a movie you have to feel until the utmost. Clint Eastwood is the prototype of true humanity, there are no sufficient words to express his greatness, and his pairing with the always impeccable Morgan Freeman make the story reach the deepest chords of the human soul. Hilary Swank proves to be a talented and courageous actress, in that she let herself be deprived of her natural beauty and femininity to convey the bare truth of life. It is a must see movie, one of those which make you think, cry, feel and cry again in an extreme way, a milestone in the history of cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

You really get to know these characters as the film progresses and the story opens up. I don't think there was any film last year that came even close to the level of perfection for this movie.

Another fine hour for Eastwood,"Clint Eastwood follows up last year's refined Mystic River, with Million Dollar Baby. The movie starts in a tired and kind of worn out boxing gym in a not too exclusive part of LA. Clint Eastwood's Frankie is the owner, a old and stubborn trainer for some boxers. His sidekick is Morgan Freeman's Eddie, he's the man that runs the gym, an old boxer himself that clean the floors, do some plumbing, give the boxers some words of wisdom when they are in need of it and so on. Into this gym trip's Hilary Swank's Maggie, energetic and determined to go as far as a title shot. What she also wants is Frankie to manage for her so she can get the proper training, but Frankie is made of the old school and that don't involves training girlies. But with her rock hard determination and maybe with some help from Eddie they can wear old Frankie down.This movie was a satisfaction to watch from the beginning, the three lead actors are all at their peak. They have some really strong roles to work with here. Frankie has characteristics with roles we have seen Eastwood done before, he works every angle of it and it results in a well deserved Oscar nomination. Swank is also very good, thrust worthy in the hard-hitting boxing sequences and wonderful as the happy human being she is. Freeman's quiet but always observing retired boxer is another enjoyment to see, a supporting role and Freeman serves it with big chunks that go a long way.With his 25th film as a director Clint Eastwood knows how to tell a story, he does it both sensitive and powerful. A moving film to carry with you. Million Dollar Baby has Oscar nominations in all the heavy categories, I hope it takes two or three statues with it home, it deserves it.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Lemon Pie and Yeats,"Greetings again from the darkness. What a pleasant surprise this gem of a film is! I had to force myself to go after the nominations because the trailer was SO BAD. Hilary Swank is totally believable as the trailer park trash dreamer who wants so much to be a professional boxer. The great Morgan Freeman brings elegance to his role as a former boxer / now wise janitor and Clint's gym. Freeman again proves he is the best movie voice over working today (see ""Shawshank Redemption"").As wonderful as Hilary and Morgan are, there is no doubt that this is Clint's (multi) million dollar baby. He directs and stars and writes the music. At almost 75 years old, he can still carry a picture, while not stealing scenes. Yes, the twist in this one smells a bit like a Hollywood chick-flick, but the talented director (Eastwood) never lets it sink to that level. This is a terrific film by a top-notch filmmaker. The story is interesting, funny, dramatic and heart-warming and the acting is truly first rate. Don't let the trailer or the thought of a boxing movie keep you away.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Good,"It's never boring. Eastwood is good when he is bad and good when he is good, so no point in dwelling on him. It's worth watching this movie just to see him. Here he has chosen to make a heart-felt, character-driven film. All of the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods. It's not the thing to see if you're in the mood for something uplifting, or something with tons of action. But it is a true gem in which the only thing that keeps it afloat is the sensitivity of the desperately needy relationship between the characters. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. A gritty, hard movie about gritty, hard people.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
My brief review of the film,"A powerful boxing film, it is such a good watch because it goes much deeper than just being about boxing. It is very deeply involving and gripping, and it is likely to even encapsulate viewers not interested in the sport. Swank is excellent but it is the acting from Eastwood that stands out the most, full of realistic emotion in this gritty, authentic tale he has filmed. The film nevertheless is imperfect, outstaying its welcome, having a few medical flaws and some real weaknesses in the plot. It is perfect viewing otherwise however and such a potent experience too insomuch that the flaws of the film do not detract very much. It is just a shame that this film cannot be discussed much further without telling how it ends. It deserves to be talked about.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
The story of life in the trenches,"It is a good thing I did not read Salon.com's review of Million Dollar Baby before I watched it. They derided it by stating that ""Clint Eastwood's boxing movie floats like a lead balloon and stings like a dead bee."" Well, I remember watching a lot of boxing at the National Guard Armory in Tampa 30 years ago, and I can assure you that this was not a ""boxing movie."" The boxing was incidental and only provided the backdrop. This was a story of dreams and failures, of backstabbing and cruelty, of wanting more than life gives you, working for it, and then having some slime ball steal it all when you are not looking because of jealousy. It was about those who take and never give, like the people who grabbed FEMA money in Miami for a hurricane that never came near them. It was the story of life. Real life in the trenches, not life as experienced by those who never worked for anything. It is not about Bush's or Kerry's life, it is about you and me.

beautifully realized drama,"The thing that strikes you the most while watching ""Million Dollar Baby"" is just how confident Clint Eastwood has become as a director. Armed with a good story, he allows the drama to unfold at its own pace, never feeling the need to fancy it up or hurry it along to cater to audience expectations. In fact, in every key area, this masterful film finds Eastwood - as both director and actor - at the top of his form.Eastwood plays Frank Dunn, an aging boxer-turned-trainer who has yet to hit the big time with any of his ""clients."" The gym he runs in a seedy part of Los Angeles seems more like a watering hole for outcasts and misfits than the launching pad for the next welter-, middle-, or heavyweight champion of the world. Then one day, into his gym, strides Maggie Fitzgerald, a wide-eyed girl from the Ozarks with dreams of making it big in the arena. Even though she has set her sights on Dunn as the man who will teach her, Dunn makes it clear to her that he has absolutely no interest in taking on ""a girl"" for training purposes. But when he sees her determination and fiery spirit, he agrees - however reluctantly - to show her the ropes. The film is an account of the warm relationship that develops between this old man - who has long ago lost contact with his own estranged daughter, and sees in Maggie, if only subconsciously, a chance to make some kind of amends for his own sins - and this feisty, full-hearted girl from the hills.Even though ""Million Dollar Baby"" has all the earmarks of a typical underdog sports movie, the film far transcends its genre through the excellence of both its screenplay and the performances by Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman, who, in the role of a former boxer himself and Dunn's closest friend, provides the voice of practicality and reason that permeates the film. His narration (as it did also in this summer's ""War of the Worlds"" and ""March of the Penguins"") lends the film the gravitas and classicism it needs to stand out from the crowd.Basing his screenplay on stories by Rope Burns, Paul Haggis has written dialogue that is astute, dramatic and authentic, far more literate than what we are accustomed to finding in most mainstream American movies. And, in his direction, Eastwood establishes just the right rhythm in the speech patterns to draw the audience into the center of the drama. Of course, Eastwood would never have been able to achieve this level of greatness without evoking strong performances from his assembled cast. As an actor, Eastwood himself has never been better than he is here. Gruff and cantankerous one moment, he is tender and warmhearted the next. Dunn has many deep-seated regrets about the past, but, even though his choices have rendered him virtually alone in the world, he still manages to remain both decent in his treatment of others and optimistic about the future. In her second Oscar-winning performance, Swank provides just the right mixture of naïve sweetness, openhearted frankness and unquenchable determination to bring Margaret to vivid life. And Freeman, as always, delivers a beautifully understated performance as the man of quiet perceptions whom Dunn has leaned on for guidance and advice for nigh unto thirty years. Together, this amazing ensemble molds what might have been a cliché-ridden tale into a work of art.Beautiful in its pacing and exquisite in its details, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is, without question, Clint Eastwood's finest film to date.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Unforgettable,"This is easily one of the most unforgettable, heart-wrenching, bittersweet films I've ever seen. Eastwood not only directs a masterpiece, but directs himself - a feat which I'm told is rather difficult. Morgan Freeman's narration is hauntingly loving, even though the story he has to tell is quite dark, but the darkness is in the reality of the story, and not in the hearts of those involved. There are few obvious effects, car chases, bullets fired, or bodies burned, but this is quite beautiful in its story, grace, and execution.This is one movie which earned the kudos (and multiple awards) it earned. There are many award-winners which made me stop and say, ""Huh?"" But this is definitely NOT one of them.Further, this is a movie for everyone. This is not a chick flick, but neither is it a guy flick. Literally all walks can love this work. It is simply amazing, and was a total surprise for this reviewer.It rates a 9.3/10 from...the Fiend :.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A great movie I can't recommend,"This movie is a piece of work. Acting, direction, cinematography, pace, subject matter. Everything is just perfect. But I still hated it. Why? It's one of the most depressing movies ever made. If slitting your wrists ever crossed your mind, do not see this.Watching the final half is painful to the point of masochism. More so when Eastwood, Swank and Freeman deliver some of the best performances of their career.Clint Eastwood will be remembered for two things: As an actor, the ultimate tough guy. As a director, a man who learned the craft of storytelling with a mature, sophisticated style. "" Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Mystic River"" are his first one-two punch of great movies since ""Unforgiven"" and ""A Perfect World"".",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"""Overrated""? Nope. It really is one of the year's best films.","A lot of people were disappointed by Clint Eastwood's ""Mystic River"" (at least those I talked to) and said it didn't live up to the critical hype.I was one of the few who wasn't disappointed and felt it was as good as its reputation would lead one to believe. When ""Million Dollar Baby"" came around, I knew it was a film I wouldn't want to miss.I used to/occasionally box and this film doesn't really capture the training struggle that ""Rocky"" did. Like ""Raging Bull,"" it's more of a character study set against a backdrop of sports. (""Rocky"" was, too, but of the three, it was the most sports-heavy.) ""Baby"" isn't really a ""sports"" movie, it's all about characters. It works very well.Eastwood's direction is superb. I don't know if his performance was Oscar-worthy, but then again, I don't recall Clint ever crying (at least so convincingly) in any of his other films.Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank both deliver great performances. It's a really fine film, a well-told story and a heartbreaking character study.If you liked ""Mystic River,"" you'll love this.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Good Story; Too Many Caricatures For Me,"I can't say that I've ever been interested in women's boxing (I'm not really a fan of any kind of boxing to be honest) but this story did interest me so I gave it a look see. It's a pretty good, traditional kind of ""underdog goes for it"" story with a solid cast that held my interest, although I can't honestly say that I was ever on the edge of my seat with any of this.The lead characters are all well played. Hilary Swank surprised me in the role of Maggie Fitzgerald, the 31 year old who decides she wants to be a professional boxer to get out of her life as a waitress. She handled the part very well and was pretty believable. Clint Eastwood played her manager, Frankie Dunn. Personally, I thought he was showing his age a bit here but again he was solid in the role of the over-cautious manager, estranged from his daughter and with some definite secrets in his life. Morgan Freeman, as always, pulled off his part as Eddie Du Pris quite well. He also had probably the funniest lines of the movie: first when he was explaining to Frankie why his socks had so many holes, and then after he KO'd the young fighter who hurt his friend - the mentally challenged ""Danger"" (Jay Baruchel) - and said simply ""there's 110"" - a reference to an earlier scene when we learned he had quit boxing after 109 fights.The primary thing I didn't like about the movie were the over-the-top caricatures. Danger was one example. There was Maggie's stereotypical hillbilly, welfare family. There was the evil champ (the female Clubber Lang, I guess) who would stop at nothing to stop Maggie from getting her title. I didn't think any of those caricatures were really necessary to the plot, and frankly I found those characters irritating. Aside from that, though, I thought this was pretty good stuff.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Outstanding,"Saw this last night in LA without much knowing what to expect. Hadn't read many reviews...only knew I liked the work of the three main stars. Swank carries the film and is at her absolute best. The last 45 minutes are some of the most powerful film-making I can remember. Eastwood is also in top form but allows Swank's performance to trump his own. Freeman is outstanding and might have done enough to earn a Best Supporting Actor nomination. This is so much more than a boxing movie, but it's right there with ""Raging Bull"" and ""Rocky"". I saw ""The Aviator"" two days ago and enjoyed ""MDB"" more.However, the film is not without fault...Eastwood has a tendency to allow scenes to go on too long and to fill them with too much dead air. The dialogue at times appears a little too ad-libbed. There are some minor logical inconsistencies. But the positives far outweigh the negatives.",,Anonymous,Drama
this truly packs a punch,"Calling ""Million Dollar Baby"" a boxing movie would be like calling ""Star Wars"" a space fantasy. Only ""Rocky"" has ever reached this quality. Hilary Swank gives a performance beyond what anyone could ever imagine as destitute waitress Maggie Fitzgerald, trying to make something of herself as a boxer. Clint Eastwood gives probably his best performance ever as trainer Frankie Dunn, trying to reassert his worth by training Maggie. Morgan Freeman is also amazing as co-trainer Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, seeking a new direction in life.Watching ""Million Dollar Baby"" you may end up feeling like you are in the middle of a boxing ring. Tough (but never gratuitously violent), disturbing (but never manipulating emotions), this elevates Hilary Swank to the level of Katharine Hepburn, Jane Fonda and Meryl Streep. Her and Morgan Freeman's Oscar wins were more than deserved (as for Best Picture, I was actually rooting for ""The Aviator""). But regardless of anything, no one can deny how great this movie is. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Well worth watching,"Million Dollar Baby is of the classical zero to hero format, but with a difference. Clint Eastwood's character is the typical ageing hero that we came to know in Unforgiven. Morgan Freeman's is also similar, the voice of reason and the only one old enough and experienced enough to make an impact.All credit to Clint Eastwood and his evident clout in the business to be allowed to pull of a movie that did not have your typical happy Hollywood ending that has ruined so many otherwise excellent movies.As a result, watching this movie is time well spent. The movie lingers on in my thoughts and it's not easy to forget the dilemma posed.More impressive however, is the real life achievements of Lucia Rijker. It's a pity that with all that behind her, she had to settle for playing the bad guy.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A GREAT love story,"I'm tempted to say that Million Dollar Baby is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen, but I'll want to wait and get a little perspective before I do. But one thing I can say is that it moved me like no other movie has done for a long time. And the three principles are awesome I'm their performances.This is a love story; the love of two men for a sport; the love of a youngster for what that sport may make possible; the love of a father-figure for his young charge. Clint Eastwood lovingly handles the story with grace and rare perspective. He coaxes award-winning performances from his cast and handles the twists and turns of his complicated story with a deftness rare in today's Directors. I was blown away.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of the Best Best Pictures,"In recent memory, no Best Picture has deserved its honor more than Million Dollar Baby. Not Gladiator, not Chicago, not A Beautiful Mind, not even The Return of the King. All of those films were notable for certain wonderful aspects, but in some way or another, they just don't reach the zenith of cinema that is Million Dollar Baby. I'll confess, I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood as a director. That alone, however, isn't enough for me when critiquing his films. I liked Mystic River, but its third act was (to put it very kindly) weak. Unforgiven is a masterpiece of a western, but no Clint Eastwood effort that I've yet seen tears open its heart so honestly and nakedly as this film. This film is all about the essence of life and living, and the debate raged by Michael Medved and other political hacks cannot detract from its impact on any viewer. Beating Saving Private Ryan, it's the closest a film has come to making me cry in a theater. I almost did, and it's my own fault for not letting in enough, but that's beside the point. The point here? Million Dollar Baby is an excellent film, rich with character, plot, and unspeakable heartache. You have to see it immediately, and try to hold back (like I did) when Eastwood visits his priest the last time. I won't give away any more than that.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Well-Crafted But Ludicrous, Insulting Story","GOOD NEWS - Interesting, right from the start....nicely filmed......an involving story with a female lead character you really care about with a fine performance by Hilary Swank, and the always-entertaining Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman as the male leads. The story, whatever one's view of the topic here, is well-crafted and certainly one you remember.BAD NEWS - Talk about an agenda! Who produced this film? Dr. Kevorkian? Hollywood's Liberal agenda for this year must have been euthanasia because this picture, as good as it is, is not Acadamy Award Best Picture material. The championship fight scene, too, is ludicrous, in that the ""bad girl,"" if this was real life, would have been disqualified - period: no if, ands or buts. And - having a priest say the ""f-word?"" Give me a break! There's an example of yet another liberal ""agenda."" - make a cleric look bad whenever possible.OVERALL - A severely flawed film but definitely interesting and worth seeing if for nothing else than provoking a good discussion on and pros-and-cons of the main subject matter (which ain't boxing, folks).",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Spare and Gripping Character Study,"""Million Dollar Baby"" is a spare, minimalist and gripping character study. Even the elements that now and then seem a bit extraneous, particularly about religious faith, turn out in the last few minutes to be vital.Director/star/scorer Clint Eastwood confidently pares the film and his performance down to its simplest elements. Tom Stern's cinematography is even more breathtaking than their collaboration on ""Mystic River,"" especially in its use of darkness, and should have been recognized for an Oscar nomination. Paul Haggis's script recalls his ahead-of-its-time TV series ""E.Z. Streets,"" where the dialog is more for character development and revelations than for plot.Particularly wonderful are the interchanges between Eastwood and Morgan Freeman that are lovely evocations of long-time male camaraderie. A key element of the film is its exploration of paternal aspects of masculinity we rarely see on film without a sexual context - friendship, mentoring and responsibility.The film, however, is almost too bare in its treatment of Hilary Swank's character, with none of the personal context that ""Girl Fight"" stressed, particularly in the lack of any romantic hints at all -- is it to avoid any issues about the tomboy's sexuality? But this keeps the spotlight on the central, quasi father-daughter relationship with its emotionally draining conclusion that packs a tremendous wallop.One of the few jarring notes is the stereotyped portrayal of her grasping hillbilly relatives, including an inconsistency or two about them.Freeman's continuing narration simply got on my nerves, even if it is rationalized in the last frame, especially when it re-emphasized something we were seeing visually. I felt it was recalling his essential commentary in ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" which is explicitly referenced in an amusing epithet.The glaring product placement for Everlast and the gratuitous reference to a Warner Brothers product were unnecessary and cheapened a moving story.",,Anonymous,Drama
Don't Get Boxed In! Check This Baby Out!,"Millions of critics have been enraptured by the sheer emotional impact of Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby"". With ""Mystic River"" and now ""Baby"", critics that were once ""unforgiven"" to Clint because of such clunkers as ""Blood Work"" & ""Bronco Billy"" are now in awe to the Clintster. Not that Clint cares about that sort of thing so much because in his eyes those pundits should really be called ""The Witches of Eastwood"". ""Million Dollar Baby"" stars Hilary Swank as Maggie, an impecunious waitress who dreams of becoming a professional boxer. Maggie is on a relentless pursuit to have a surly old trainer named Frankie train her. Maggie works out in Frankie's boxing gym everyday in hoping to persuade Frankie to be her hit-man. Frankie is played by none other than Eastwood himself. To be ""frank"" with you, I admired Eastwood's straightforward acting work here, but do not think it deserved a Best Actor Oscar nomination. However, his direction of ""Million Dollar Baby"" was worth its price. His attention to detail and framework was of the technical knockout variety. Moreover, the movie's startling emotional turn midway in the narrative is one of the most profound plot-twisters that I have seen in film in a very long time. Morgan Freeman plays the assistant gym sidekick to Frankie who he himself plays an imperative role as the overseer & narrator of the story's dramatic chops. Freeman is an acting legendary God in the business; he did play ""God"" in ""Bruce Almighty"". However, his work here was poignant but not of the Best Supporting Actor nomination weight-class. The heavyweight of ""Million Dollar Baby"" is Hilary Swank. She delivers passionately blow-by-blow. Her lauded performance has been recognized by numerous critics and my scorecard also shares that exact sentiment. She is the frontrunner for the Best Actress Academy Award. If Swank wins her second golden boy, Hilary will be living large in the ""Hollywood Hills"". Paul Haggis' screenplay does possess a heartfelt punch to it, but it felt lightweight at times in the church scenes. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is somber and it's unlike your typical boxing movie, but those are no reasons why you should throw in the towel for ""Million Dollar Baby"".

Coping with Elevated Expectations,"It's always difficult to be objective about a film like Million Dollar Baby. It's winning all the awards and getting lots of tens. When I walk into a theater to see something like this, the flick is already competing with Citizen Kane and Gone With the wind (or in this case Raging Bull and Somebody Up There Likes Me) rather than Kangaroo Jack or the Ghosts of Edendale.I tend to become hyper-critical on such occasions which negatively affects my ability to sustain disbelief. Since I am a boxing historian, this tendency particularly pervades my perception of boxing movies all of which seem way too fake and over-simplified as compared to the sport itself.One time I was covering a fight for Ring magazine and I walked into the dressing room where a manager was trying to force his fighter's fists into a pair of thumb-less gloves.A ruling had recently been passed in New York that preliminary fighters must wear thumb-less gloves as a measure to reduce eye injuries. This fighter had never even seen a pair of thumb-less gloves until five minutes before he was supposed to go into the ring against a local betting favorite. The scene in that dressing room ( ""I ain't wearing those f------ things"") was far more dramatic than anything I've ever seen in a boxing film and these guys weren't even in the ring yet.So boxing films can best be viewed as metaphors and as metaphors they can not be taken literally. Only in movies do fighters score one punch first round knockouts over and over again. Only in movies do fighters foul as obviously and flagrantly as do the heavies in the movies. On an on and on.So I'm sitting in the theater, aware of the maudlin, manipulating nature of the metaphor. I'm sort of rolling my eyes at the phoniness of it all, the clichés, the straight from Of Mice and Men story about Axel the Dog and the foreshadowing implicit within the tale. The too familiar technique of Morgan Freeman voice over. Certainly, our nation's critics couldn't be falling for this crap could they? And then, somehow, I too began to fall for it. I gave up the resistance which was futile anyway.I started pulling for Swank, the actress and Eastwood the director.Let's face it, Eastwood passed John Wayne as the the most iconic of American actors about five years ago and now he takes his place with Scorcese amongst our best directors and here he is playing an old man with no intention of getting the girl. At this point, I'm rooting for Clint more than ever and I've always been on his side ever since the days of Rowdy Yates in Rawhide.Freeman, yeah, we've sen this before too but ya know what? The reason we see it so often is because it works. I don't know what the thing with ""Danger"" was all about but even that worked sorta.And Swank. Top of her game.I'll be a fan forever.By the end, I forgot about the thumb-less gloves and the career of Clint and Glory and Insomnia and everything else except that I was sitting in a movie theater watching a great movie with my wife and daughter and all three of us were getting something from the film, something different for each of us, something we won't be able to articulate but may come back someday and provide us with courage and resilience in the clutch when we're on the ropes.",,Anonymous,Drama
Incredible.,"I have never loved Clint Eastwood more than I do after seeing this film. Frankie Dunn is a beautiful character, played with grace and insight by Eastwood. I positively fell in love with his character through the movie. Hillary Swank glides in and out of the film. Her acting sneaks up on you, and before you know it, you are in awe of her. Morgan Freeman is stunning. I felt that this was his best part since The Shawshank Redemption. The entire cast is phenomenal.The fact that Eastwood not only starred in the film, but produced it, directed it, and composed the music for it blows my mind. There were so many subtle moments where I savored every second as it was unfolding. This film was truly a work of art. Pay attention to the lighting. Every flicker of pain and intensity in Eastwood's clear blue eyes is accented by the lighting. Every grimace, every line on his face speaks to his character. The story simply cannot be done justice with words. My vote for Best Picture of 2004 goes to Million Dollar Baby.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
And the winner by a knockout...MILLION DOLLAR BABY,"Hot new prospect Million Dollar Baby electrified the crowds and sent out an ominous warning to other contenders with a sensational knockout in the later rounds here last night. Having set the pace from the first round, the up and coming champion remained aggressive until the final four rounds where she dazzled her fans with one of the greatest displays of skill not seen since the days of Raging Bull. With consummate skill Million Dollar Baby changed tactics in the later rounds, a strategy devised by her trainer Clint Eastwood. It was a move nobody at ringside saw coming, and as one critic stated, it was in the final third act that Million Dollar Baby stepped into masterpiece territory. The performance, considered by many as the best of the year, was more than enough to guarantee a shot at the World Title on February 27th. Hailing from Malpaso Boxing Gym, where under the tutelage of veteran trainer Clint Eastwood, Million Dollar Baby has become one of the hottest contenders around. In fact, many critics and pundits believe that Eastwood, one of the most respected men in the business, will have himself another world champion come fight night at the Oscars, his first being Unforgiven who was title holder in 1993.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Fight movie with a wallop of a punch to the gut!,"Million Dollar Baby just came to our fair city this weekend, so I had to go see it. I'm leery of seeing a film when my expectations are so high, it's usually a letdown. Not in this case. I left the theater over an hour ago, and my eyes are still puffy and my nose is still stuffed and running. This is Clint Eastwood's best performance since playing Bill Munny in Unforgiven. In this movie he plays Frankie Dunn, a grizzled old fighter who now owns a boxing gym and trains young fighters. Morgan Freeman is perfect in the role of his sidekick, another old ex-fighter, taking care of the gym for Frankie, while Frankie takes care of him, for reasons that become known during the film. Same type of role he had in Unforgiven as Ned Logan. But the person who really shines in my opinion is Hilary Swank. This film is going to get her noticed. She was good in ""Boys Don't Cry"" and OK in ""Insomnia"", but in this she is simply terrific. She talks Frankie Dunn into managing and training her, against his better judgment, a decision that will have lasting consequences on his life.Without giving too much away, one of the things that made this film so gut-wrenching for me was that it wasn't sentimental, and didn't fall into the trap of having to have a happy ending, rather the ending is about making choices and dealing with tragedy. We may all fantasize the happy ending,we fantasize because it so rarely happens; but if we live long enough, we all have to deal with choices and decisions in tragic situations.Well, my nose is running again as I urge you to please go see this film, I think it will be worth your while.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Excellent film from a true Renaissance man,"Congrats to all responsible for the film. I'm writing this a couple hours after Oscars finished- yup, that's right, it's now 2008. Nah seriously, this is an excellent film. One wouldn't know what the film was about from the previews. Not that one should. Nevertheless, typically accomplished work from Clint. And this time, he wrote the music too. If he could film the movie and be in it at the same time, he could cut down on salaries to people by minimizing the number of people in the production. All that said, Morgan Freeman is excellent, though really the Oscar is a bit of a typically Hollywood, guilt-ridden, let's-right-wrongs Oscar. That being said, he's one of the best, and he's as good as ever. One's tempted to take him for granted, he's that good. I think I'm going to have to go back and see ""Unforgiven"" again to see him collaborating with Clint again. Hilary Swank is excellent. She didn't deserve the Oscar, I'm sorry. Obviously, much of the Academy hadn't seen ""Vera Drake"" or she wouldn't have gotten it. I haven't seen ""Maria Full of Grace"" so don't know how that lady's performance measured up. All that being said, Swank really is a very talented actress. The film itself, well, some nice elements to it. Swank conveys winsomeness and determination as well as any actress this side of Jodie Foster. The characters tend toward stock, but really, they are nicely colored to the point that the story is not disabled by their blandness. Clint takes what might be a straight-forward sports biopic and makes it something so much more. This is a very enjoyable movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Clint Eastwood turns in another great movie,"Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) is an old hand at training. His latest fighter (Anthony Mackie) doesn't have the heart and he's reluctant to get him the championship shot. Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) is a self professed white trash. She scrounge enough money for the gym, but Frankie refuses to train her because she's too old. She won't give up, and with the help an old retired fighter Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman), she convinces Frankie to give her a chance.This is a great standard underdog sports story for 3/4 of the movie. It works great. Clint and Morgan are old hands at this. They cancel each other a bit with their grumbling voices and their gruff demeanor. Hilary Swank is perfect for the role. She's no princess. She can definitely play the hungry white trash role.Then the last 30 minutes turn dark. It's a change in tone. It has difficult things to say. If it could be edited down, it could be even better.

"Oscar calibre, and yet","ADDITIONAL SPOILER WARNINGCoincidentally, both of the best pictures in this year's Oscar are about choosing death against life, although the circumstances are markedly different. The mood is even more polarised. In Mar adentro, I've never seen a story about death that has so much life that while deeply moved, I left the cinema elated and thankful. With Million Dollar Baby, I cannot remember ever leaving a cinema feeling so depressed.Many describe the first half of the movie a ""Rocky"" type of uplifting story. Director Eastwood however is determined not to give people who are looking for usual Hollywood cheap thrills what they want. Resisting numerous opportunities to melodramatic magnifications, he tells the story in a simple old style and with minimalism. In addition, some detachment is gained through voice over narration of an observer (albeit not an entirely detached one) one-time great boxer and now janitor ""Scrap"" (Morgan Freeman). The final acceptance of late comer (over 30) Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank) by trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) to pugilistic training does bring an emotional stir but even that tends towards underplaying. Then, except for one bout in which Maggie has her nose broken, all her victories are covered in such rapidity that can almost be mistaken for carelessness. But make no mistake about it. That is exactly the way it is intended to be, so as not to take the focus away from the characters, and their interaction.Scrap and Frankie is a pair that have been through a lot together, and have reached a point in their life when there's nothing that cannot be said between them. And it's not what is said, by the way they say it, that counts. The spark between Freeman and Eastwood provides some of the much-needed easy and humorous moods in this movie.Scrap plays a role that is almost like a guardian angel to Maggie. There is not a great deal of interaction between them but whenever there is, he is always gentle and understanding. Morgan and Swank light up the perpectually gloomy screen in this movie with the warmth they radiate.It is course on the interaction between Frankie and Maggie that this movie rests. Through the initial rejection, the gradual acceptance, the intense training and the eventual sharing of success, we see the development of a mentor/protégé relationship that is quite common, even when superbly acted. It's the abrupt and tragic turn of events in the middle that brings into focus the father/daughter relationship that has been fermenting all along. Not even descriptions such as ""heart-breaking"" can do justice to the emotional turmoil the audience experiences through the second half of the movie. The depth of the emotion intensifies as the agony portrayed by Eastwood and Swank towards the end pierce the air like a silent scream.While Million Dollar Baby is undoubtedly Oscar calibre in many respects, it is extremely depressing to watch. Final observation: here's a movie with absolutely no sex whatsoever (those who suggest otherwise may wish to consider consulting a psychiatrist), only one four-letter word (uttered, incidentally, by a priest), and a lot of guts in not trying to please the mass.",,Anonymous,Drama
Congartulations for not being 100% Hollywood infected,"The film is only in 50% Hollywood like: the exchanges about ""mummy"" and ""daddy"", so straightforward and psychologically simplified, are disadvantage. As if Eastwood didn't have enough trust to the audience - he had to make all the father-figure metaphors, hints and parallels so evident... ""American Dream"", fabulous for a European like me, in this film becomes a probable option - maybe because the possible interpretations of the ""success"" that the film gives are not all too one-sided (see ""Scrap's"" or Danger's"" story, for example, although Eastwood is not resolute to explore the theme of a seeming failure as some sort of personal success to the end. At times he even lets us believe that what really matters is the ""title"" or having one's moment of glory. ) What I loved about the film was its anti-Hollywood features: minimalistic scenery, meaningful play of shadow and light - at times poetic and speaking volumes, when the faces emerge from the darkness, plus quintessential language (except for the ""psychoanalytic"" utterances, fortunately, not abundant in the film). Very interesting and deep study of the relationship between the master and the apprentice - subtle, complex, moving and, thank God, not melodramatic as the Hollywood filmmakers would typically have it.

My favorite film of 2004,"Clint Eastwood's latest work, MILLION DOLLAR BABY, stars Hilary Swank as Maggie Fitzgerlad, a poor 31 year old woman who has aspirations of making it big as a boxer and wants nothing but the guidance of an old ""cut man"", Frankie Dunn. At first, Frankie is hesitant on training Maggie due to the fact that she's a girl and claims that girls are not tough enough. Morgan Freeman's character, Scrap, decides to help Maggie and angers Frankie in the process. Frankie has managed some great fighters in the past and doesn't want to take a chance on a near middle aged trailer park girl. Frankie and Maggie then begin a special bond that is without a doubt one of the best stories ever told in the history of film.The Academy did indeed pick the right winner for Best Picture, Director, Actress, and Best Supporting.

It came very close to eclipsing Sideways as my choice for #1 film of the year, but I thought it had a few very slight flaws that prevented that from happening. Baby is one of those movies that (literally, in this particular case) seems to punch you in the gut. Clint Eastwood's last picture, the also magnificent Mystic River, left me with the same powerful, haunted feeling that this film does. I'm still reflecting and contemplating ideals of the movie despite it ending an hour ago. A lion's share of Million Dollar Baby's success must go to lead actress Hilary Swank, who completely immerses herself in the role and gives the best acting by a lead actress this year. Clint Eastwood himself is also very strong, and Morgan Freeman gives the movie his usual dose of quiet dignity. The one thing in Million Dollar Baby that I could've perhaps done without is the portrayal of a mentally retarded wannabe boxer played by Jay Baruchel, who comes off as perhaps too cartoonish. However, it's only a small section of the film. Baby takes an unexpected twist in its final 1/4, and it's easily one of the most emotional and truly sincere sections of a film in a very long time. Very highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Hilary Swank knocks me out !!!,"This film is one of those that when you leave the cinema you still think about it, and you say to yourself, what a wonderful film I have just seen! I have to say, that when I bought the ticket, I was not so sure, a boxing film..mummy, I don't know.....but this is a boxing film that you should see and you'll be glad to see it. Yes, it's about boxing, but it's about life, love, a thrilling and heartbreaking movie. And Hilary Swank is outstanding, what an actress!! It's more than evident that she put her heart and soul into this demanding piece of work. I think she will have her second Oscar at home soon. Clint Eastwood is good too in his manager role, and the brilliant Morgan Freeman deserves the Oscar too. What more I could say, it's one of the best movies of 2004....go, see it and enjoy the show!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Clint Eastwood at his best,"I have to admit, I was very skeptical when I first saw the title. I am not a big fan of Clint Eastwood as an actor, but as a director I really liked ""Mystic River"". Well, with this movie, as an actor and director he has reached another level.This movie should get the Oscar for best film, best lead actor and best lead actress. I haven't seen such a good movie for a long, long time. Hilary Swank is absolutely fantastic. After seeing so many rubbish big productions trying to buy their success through massive marketing campaigns, I was about to lose faith until I saw ""Million Dollar Baby"".let's be simple: the story is good, the actors are excellent and it's beautifully and intelligently directed. A real treat for anyone who likes good films.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Clint Eastwood is a national treasure,"At first glance, ""Million Dollar Baby"" seems like it should be pedestrian fare. An aging boxing trainer and his old sidekick take in a poor white girl who dreams of becoming a champ and, together, they work to get to the top. It's the sort of pulpy stuff the likes of Jim Thompson and Charles Willeford might have reveled in.So why does ""Million Dollar Baby"" work? One reason: Clint Eastwood.At 75, Eastwood might very well be the best American filmmaker working today. A true auteur, it's evident of his amazing talent that he's taken a generally conventional story and turned it into a rich, deep, insightful character study.As for conservatives enraged by the film: Get real. They're all for promoting free thought and expression so long as it doesn't differ from what they believe, their worldview. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a movie. What the characters do, the decisions they make fit with what makes the story work.There's no great conspiracy or agenda at work. It's good storytelling and conservative hosts should worry more about having an administration that fabricates evidence and seems quite keen on stifling due process and expression in the name of security. Now, that's a frightening agenda.What propels ""Million Dollar Baby"" are three spectacular performances. Hilary Swank, as the young wannabe champ Maggie Fitzgerald, proves beyond any doubt that her Best Actress Oscar for ""Boys Don't Cry"" (1999) was no fluke. She imbues Maggie with grit, determination and courage; and when the story requires her to change focus, she makes Maggie vulnerable without ever making her weak. After watching Swank in this film, you'll understand why she's winning all the awards for her performance.Eastwood as the trainer Frankie Dunn and Morgan Freeman as his assistant Eddie Dupris rarely have been better. Not only is he a great filmmaker, Eastwood's also turned into a fine actor. Frankie, like many of Eastwood characters, is a man of few words. He struggles with his own dilemmas and remains emotionally distant. Yet, there's real depth of feeling in Eastwood's portrayal. He conveys more genuine emotion with his craggy, weathered face than most actors can with superb dialogue and Actor's Studio training.Watching Eastwood and Freeman work together is a treat. There's tremendous chemistry between them. They play off each other with supreme ease like an old couple very familiar with each other's idiosyncrasies. They're good friends, old pros whose riffs go down smoothly like a glass of great scotch.Despite directing many films, Eastwood always was known primarily as an actor. But in the last several years, he has emerged as one of America's great filmmakers with work such as ""Unforgiven"" (1992) and ""Mystic River"" (2003). Heck, Eastwood even turned that horrible novel, ""The Bridges of Madison County,"" into a good film in 1995.True, ""Million Dollar Baby"" works with numerous cinematic clichés. But Eastwood still creates visual poetry, from his choice of camera angles to eliciting tender, effective and moving performances, from his superb use of his own musical score to creating the perfect mood.The film's flaw perhaps is the over-use of Freeman's voice-over narration. Telling an audience what to think, how to feel, the real emotion of a particular moment are something the actors must convey through their performances; Eastwood and screenwriter Paul Haggis shouldn't have to rely on narration. Narration is an easy way for screenwriters to cheat and, more often than not, I got the feeling that's exactly what Haggis was doing.Freeman's voice isn't the issue here. That's amazing. But, at times, his narration is obtrusive. The reason for the narration's made clear at the end, but I wish Eastwood had limited its use, that he'd used it as cleverly as he did his music.Nevertheless, ""Million Dollar Baby"" remains touching, funny, poignant, powerful. It's a superbly acted film made by a master craftsman.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Great Drama!,"Million Dollar Baby is a great, moving story. This is a movie that sort of deserved the Best Picture award. Nearly all the actors did a fantastic job especially Clint Eastwood.Clint Eastwood stars as a grumpy boxing trainer. He trained some of the best over his long career. Then he meets a poor girl with ambition of winning boxing fights. But, Frankie is reluctant to train the girl, Maggie. He eventually gives in and things happen that are destined to change lives.As I said before, the acting is superb.

Clint does a wagner number,"Clint Eastwood and Mary Shelley may not seem to have a lot in common, but both have a dab hand at Gothic Romance  dark stories of wish-fulfilment in which the central characters battle Fate, and lose, but do so heroically. Wagner wrote operas around such themes. Here, Clint has taken his text from the obscure ""F X Tool"", a former boxing trainer and ""cut man"", who published one well-received book of boxing short stories. ""Rope Burns"" when he was nearly seventy. Here, aging, never quite has-been Frank against his better judgment takes on enthusiastic woman boxer Maggie, who though past 30 is aching to succeed, despite being a self-admitted piece of trailer trash. Maggie of course is literally a knockout and goes from strength to strength  until she comes up against the Bear, the meanest female fighter in the world. And then we flip over into almost a different story about the testing of faith.There is plenty of moody, gloomy photography and some fine boxing sequences (the Bear is played by a real women's boxing champion). Boxing is not my favourite sport but you do get to appreciate its attraction for those who are good at it. The lamentable thing is that so many derive real pleasure from watching. But as I said the movie is not really about boxing as about a heroic struggle against overwhelming odds, or the fates, if you will.There are only three characters of any real consequence, Frank, Maggie and Frank's sidekick Eddie, who provides a mordant commentary on the story. Frank, as played by Clint is gnarled and tough, yet not quite tough enough. Guilt-ridden, he grieves for his estranged daughter and Maggie fills the gap. Hilary Swank as Maggie, despite the deprivation and loneliness, is all brighteyed ambition. We are never allowed to dwell on the improbability of such a character; instead we nod approvingly as she storms into Frank's twilight years, batters opponents senseless and gets into the ring for the big one. It's a remarkable performance and Hilary might as well have the Oscar, in a lean year. Morgan Freeman is very comfortable as Eddie the commentator in what is almost a repeat of his performance in ""The Shawshank Redemption"".The trouble with Gothic Romance is that we know from the start that the protagonists are going to fail no matter how hard they try. Their failing is not a function of some fatal flaw in their make-up, but because the Universe is against them. Failure is thus reassuring. Clint however points out that this should not stop us from trying. Maggie at least gave it her best shot. For her, the ride was worth it. .",,Anonymous,Drama
One of the Great Love Stories Trapped Within a Flawed Film,"There is both much to admire, and to despise, within this film. I believe the positives far outweigh the negatives, yet the negatives are so odious, so blatant, that they amount to a major defacement--all the more so because they could have so easily been corrected--marring what otherwise might have been a masterpiece of film making. As a drama about two lonely people who find each other and fall in love (though not in a romantic sense), this film is in a class few others share. As a drama about the sport of boxing, it veers wildly between insightful and ridiculous, and the film as a whole too often embraces caricature and melodrama, crippling our suspension of disbelief and leaving it floundering.The film revolves about Maggie Fitzgerald--a 30 year old woman who attempts to escape a difficult upbringing in a single-minded pursuit of a boxing career--and Frankie Dunn, a down-on-his-luck manager/trainer and owner of a rundown boxing gym. She basically takes up residence in his gym, working out and trying to persuade him to take her under his wing. He wants no part of managing a ""girl""--especially one virtually over the hill--and puts her off with one caustic rebuff after another. She persists, and over time, stubbornly refusing to take no for an answer, finally persuades him to train her. Before long, reluctantly, a bond begins to grow between the crusty old trainer, permanently estranged from his only daughter, and this fiercely determined woman whose father, the only person who ever loved her, died long ago. It is this growing relationship that is the heart of the film, and it is magnificently played out between these fine actors. Hilary Swank is mesmerizing, every gesture, every expression is convincing. The fact that her character is so sweet-natured, so adorable (in an early fight, she shrugs her shoulders to Frankie's mock disgust in such a way that it had to have melted the hearts of anyone with a heart) that it might give us pause later after the lights go on when we might ask, ""How could this immensely genial character have been so alone?"" but Swank is so compelling that as we watch her, we never doubt her or her situation for a moment. Clint Eastwood is almost as good, and his brusque, brooding, deeply wounded old gym-rat provides an excellent foil to Swank's more hopeful character. We become ensnared in their emotional dynamics, much more than their pursuit of a boxing title. As we watch their love for each other grow (the love between surrogate father and daughter), our love for each of their characters grows as well, so that the ultimate tragedy that befalls them is almost unbearable to watch.Or at least, it would be if you can ignore the intruding absurdities. First among them are some of the fight sequences. Most of these play well, though there are occasional moments when a punch clearly lands upon air, half a meter from the opponent's face, and yet we hear an accompanying sound effect as if there had been a solidly landed blow. But the principle problem concerns the fights involving a character called ""The Blue Bear""--a figure so ludicrous her appearance in a comic book would be jarringly idiotic. We see her perform acts of deranged mayhem in the ring that make the biting off of an ear seem pacifist. A Nazi Storm Trooper would find her embarrassing. Anyone displaying these traits in real life would be barred from prize-fighting years before reaching a title fight. To suggest that such a one could become champion is light years beyond far-fetched. Apparently, every one of her referees, and the two judges at court-side, are carefully selected for their inability to open their eyes. {Brief Spoilers Ahead} In the climatic showdown, we are told the ""Bear"" wins in spite of egregious violations, including the knock-out punch which occurs 10 seconds after the bell has sounded. {Spoilers End} I thought ""Cinderella Man's"" depiction of the fighter Max Baer was a bit over the top--but not compared to this. In a hundred other boxing films I have seen nothing to approach the outlandishness of this depiction.There were other problems. Maggie's surviving family were overwrought, cardboard caricatures. Morgan Freeman, who plays Frankie's closest friend, provides the film's narration, and though he does his usual excellent job, his comments weren't as finely written (or were perhaps over written) as those he voiced in ""Shawshank Redemption."" Two or three times we hear him talk about being ""somewhere between nowhere and good-bye,"" which was two or three times too many.In spite of the drawbacks, which are far from incidental, I found myself spellbound by Maggie and Frankie's relationship. There are other nice things about the film, not least of which is a crowd-pleasing ""interchange"" between Freeman and a bully/would-be fighter, and Eastwood's direction which, in spite of contributing to the lapses noted above, does a fabulous job of getting the most from his cast and providing a wonderfully paced movie--but it is the strength of the central relationship which buoys the film, keeping it afloat in the midst of its sea of weakness. I cannot help but mourn the loss of what could have been. A more realistic villain, a fine-tuning of the script, and this might have been both the greatest boxing movie of all time, and one of the great love stories. I'd like to shake Haggis (the writer) and Eastwood for failing to fully capitalize on their opportunity.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
long live Clint Eastwood!,"Hardly one year after the shady ""Mystic River"" (2003), ""grandad"" Clint Eastwood changes mood and perseveres with ""Million Dollar Baby"" (2004), an unusual film about women's boxing which presents none sign of quieting down from the former cowboy and ""dirty Harry"". He once said about his movies that they had to be before all: entertaining and compelling. Given the commercial and critical enthusiasm of his work, he well fulfilled his pledges.On the paper, ""Million Dollar Baby"" nearly looks like any success story, a genre that American cinema has a liking for. Maggie Fitzerald (Hilary Swank) is a 31 year-old woman who works as a waitress in a restaurant. Perfectly aware that her life isn't much worth, she only sees boxing to find a way in life. With the help of an old coach Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) and after weeks of intense training, she knows a meteoric rise with fame and glory under her belt. But Clint Eastwood is a too demanding author to content himself to shot this kind of story and is ready to go beyond it to get more interested in the relationship between Maggie and his character Frankie. As a matter of fact, ""Million Dollar Baby"" diverts codes of the boxing world and success story to develop a touching friendship story between two opposite characters that will peak in the last wrenching third of the film. One the one hand, Maggie Fitzerald, ready to do anything to become the best woman boxing. She sees in Frankie Dunn, the perfect coach and eventually a father figure to enable her to reinforce her trust in herself. On the other hand, Frankie Dunn, an irascible old man whose life has especially been a series of disappointments and who tries to find a hope in redemption (I think the somewhat dreary scenery of the gymnasium reflects well his temper). But in reality, he hides a golden heart and perceives Maggie as the daughter he hasn't had but would have liked to. To tell this absorbing story of an unlikely friendship, Eastwood uses pure film-making basics: a straight-forward narrative line, lovable characters and a calm directing without exaggerations. The whole is tinged with a huge tenderness and a humor of quality to which it is impossible to resist. And just like in ""Unforgiven"" (1992), to hear a few guitar notes is better than a whole classical music orchestra.A new variation of the American dream, a praise to courage and perseverance, a just description of the boxing world, a poignant father-daughter relationship. ""Million Dollar Baby"" combines all these things. With this monument of emotion, Clint Eastwood is really at the peak of his art. It probably won't be his last movie but one thing is sure: by getting old, he improves and currently shots better than ever. It's simple, genuine and moving cinema at its best and no wonder it seduced the jury at the Oscars ceremony earlier this year by awarding it 4 Oscars including best actress (Hilary Swank) and best director (Clint Eastwood).",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Clint Eastwood is a genius storyteller, director...awesome movie!","""Million Dollar Baby"" is a must see film. I was riveted watching this movie. In an era of lackluster movies and cookie-cutter film making, it is refreshing to see a quality film that distinguishes itself as a sure contender for an Oscar nod.The character portrayals by Morgan Freeman, Eastwood and Hillary Swank (wow), was just incredible. The storyline was well developed and the plot twisted in directions that bucked conventional apple-pie/tidy endings. This was a ""real"" movie, it tugs at emotions without trying! Most significantly, this is an inspiring movie that will motivate people to remain steadfast in achieving their life goals.If a person leaves this picture without having been emotionally moved (and hopefully inspired my its message to pursue personal life goals), their heart is dark, cold, and stony.Clint Eastwood made a quality picture that adds to his filmography as one of his best works ever!

"Pure, unbridled excellence","I'll cut to the chase -- this movie is flawless.The direction, cinematography, and writing are all significantly better than ""Mystic River,"" with all three leads (Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, and Morgan Freeman) turning in Oscar-worthy performances. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is an intimate triumph, and could legitimately be called an ""instant classic."" The specifics of the story are available everywhere, so I'll spare those details. Less often discussed is the skill with which Eastwood treads the razor-thin border between ""been there, done that"" and perfection.A look at this film's basic premise might make it appear rife with potential cliché, and the finished product may have lived down to that expectation in the hands of a less insightful director. Watching Eastwood evade the unintentional humor of Hollywood's traditional ""underdog-made-good"" stories (and soaking up the leads' brilliant performances) comprises much of the appeal of the film's first two acts.The third act is simply arresting. The acting is one hundred percent flawless throughout the film's last thirty minutes. The pacing remains perfect. To a man, the sold-out audience of which I was a member was utterly, silently transfixed after the beginning of the film's third stanza.As soon as you possibly can, see this movie.

The non-glorification of boxing!,"Clint Eastwood has done it again. He has reversed the thinking from old school Hollywood that violence is glorious. 'Unforgiven' was the anti-western masterpiece showing that old west America wasn't just about the guys in the black and white hats and it was the film that defined Eastwood as a director. 'Million Dollar Baby' shows that Clint is making the best movies of his career over the last 15 years. Unlike 'Rocky' where the fight is uproarious as you cheer and the hero gets the girl in the end, 'Million Dollar baby' shows how ugly boxing violence is and why the sport has degenerated into a low brow competition in recent years.Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman deserve Oscars for this film as their performances are raw, heartfelt and just plain worthy. Eastwood also deserves his second Oscar as best director and this film is superior, yes, superior I say to Martin Scorsese's over rated 'Raging Bull' from 1980. Made on a relatively low budget with no special effects, just the good old fashioned elbow grease that Hollywood use to consume itself in, 'Million Dollar Baby' might be the best picture of 2004 for its message as well as for its creative talents.",,Anonymous,Drama

Powerful,"Frankie (Eastwood) agrees to take on a girl fighter (Swank) to make a run for the title.To borrow a few words from the late Selma Diamond (Night Court): I laughed, I cried, it became a part of me.I don't think I have ever been affected by a movie as this one. All good. The dialog was simply the best. And, a lot of it was funny, really good stuff.And, get this: this was the first draft by the screen writer, Paul Haggis. Eastwood didn't want to change anything. Something, eh? I know this from watching the second DVD in the package.Eastwood, Freeman and Swank worked nothing short of a classic. All the acting was first class. You won't forget this one. The boxing scenes were real, I believe. If not, you could have fooled me. Yes, I watched the other movies up for Best Picture and said that Million Dollar Baby better be better than good to beat this group. WOW! That is all I can say. The others, while good, never really stood a chance. You'll see.There is only one little thing that really didn't fit. Frankie gives Maggie a robe to wear into boxing rings. The words on the back are in Greek or Gaelic. He tells her that he will tell her what the words mean when she wins the big one. She wins a number of fights leading up to the title fight wearing the robe. In today's world, those words would have been mentioned in magazines, newspapers, TV spots etc. Also, some fans might have called out the meaning too. Maybe it was just a case of Maggie wanting to hear the words from Frank. Maybe. Anyway, go see the movie and you, too, will learn what the words mean. No, you don't have to fight anyone, just pay for the ticket or the DVD rental.As much as I liked this movie, it still did not make me a fan of women boxing. Doesn't make sense to me.

Eastwood's Worst Film yet,"What in the world was the Academy thinking?!! Eastwood's movies get slower and slower, more and more tedious as he ages.

Another walk on in a long string of walk ons. For a man with such obvious talent, where's the beef? Moving on to Eastwood himself... You've already heard my opinion on his directing style and now the acting (and I use the term loosely). Clint adds this to a long and still growing list of broken heroes,has beens and other sad sack ""strong and silent"" types. I personally think he needs to retire from both sides of the camera. At least he didn't embarrass himself with a nude scene with someone young enough to be his granddaughter again. Uggghhh!!

Cringeworthy at times and brilliant at others,"Million Dollar Baby is a very inconstant film in quality terms. The start, I mean, the first twenty minutes of film are full of over the top situations (such as the conversation with the priest scene), silly inane dialogs, and a weird voice over by Morgan Freeman narrating everything that happened in the film, even when wasn't needed at all. Yes, horrible way to start a film. I felt that the actors were very uncomfortable saying certain lines because it was truly awful. Paul Haggis, no wonder. The guy who wrote and directed the arguably most moronic and inane(and undeserved) Oscar Winner Picture ever(Crash). Clint's direction was really really good, because the film was brilliant since the 30 minutes and this 'briliantism' lasted until the final 30 minutes. Was really good. The main problem with this film is the quantity of unrealistic situations. A hospital would never allow a patient's leg gangrene, for example. The priest was also completely put of the reality in the film. These among numerous other problems. I could enjoy a lot this film, which is technically very good too, I think Clint and Swank gave their best performances in their careers, but there is way too many awful parts that can't be forgiven. 7/ 10",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Clint Eastwood's Best Movie Ever!,"Van Gogh had ""Starry Night"", DaVinci had ""The Mona Lisa"", and now Clint Eastwood has ""Million Dollar Baby"". At first glance this movie seems like a typical boxing movie. This movie runs much deeper than your typical ""sports movie"". Clint Eastwood stars as Frankie, an aging fight manager, who runs a boxing gym in Los Angeles. Frankie goes to church daily for sins that are not quite known. With Frankie is his friend ""Scrap"", a former fighter that is blind in one eye, that has been with Frankie for several years. Frankie changes when he meets Maggie, a superb Hilary Swank. Maggie is a 30 something waitress who aspires to be a champion boxer. At first Frankie refuses to train Maggie. But Maggies persistence and attitude gives Frankie a change of heart. Frankie takes Maggie to the top and grows to love maggie. The movie has a lot of boxing scenes, but is more about the longing for family. In just over two hours Clint Eastwood creates a masterpiece of emotion and heart, with an incredible cast, and great dialouge. Clint Eastwood stars, directed and composed the wonderful score for this movie. People may think going into this movie that it might be another ""Rocky"".

It is really a beautiful movie about simple, yet strong things such as: Bravery, determination, hope, trust, compassion and the greatness of giving it one last chance. the last 30 min or so, are very strong and surprising and leaves you with a feeling inside that tells you that this is not just an average movie.

"brilliant, moving film","Saw Million Dollar Baby last night at a screening, marvelous storytelling, acting and drama. Eastwood dealt with issues of child abuse so powerfully in Mystic River and deals with similarly powerful issues and relationships here. His performance is terrific and Swank is probably due her 2nd Oscar, but will ironically lose to Annette Bening who has never won (Swank edged Bening in 1999). Freeman is wonderful as well.What will be interesting how red staters deal with this movie. Critic Micheal Medved is already trying to whip up anti-Million Dollar Baby rhetoric by giving away crucial plot twists and saying that he's offended that this film is being released at Christmas. Ugh. Don't let closed minded bigots keep you away from one of the best movies of the year. You owe it to Clint who is in the midst of an amazingly productive era in a long and successful career.",,Anonymous,Drama
Earns a million stars!,"I do not know how to begin praising this movie. The plot was amazing and it goes very deep. The relationship between the characters is just so real that I felt like I was taken into the movie myself. I felt like I was there actually watching everything happen. I've never been interested in boxing, but this was okay because the movie was about so much more than the sport. It was obvious to see that Hilary Swank's character, Maggie was not a failure even though she wound up on the floor after fighting for the winning title. She won because she achieved what she wanted to achieve in life, and there aren't many people who can be satisfied with that. This movie can teach us all something about life and how to appreciate it and though many may find the message behind the movie cliché, I don't think it could be emphasized enough since we all forget how to appreciate life over and over again.The acting was amazing. Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, and Morgan Freeman work so well together, and I had no reason to be displeased with how they acted out their roles.Warning: If you have not yet watched the movie, do not read the next paragraph. It will ruin the ending for you!!The only part of the movie which confused me was when Frankie pulls the cord. Isn't this illegal and immoral to some people? I'm not sure if he should have done this. The movie was really good so I'm not going to dwell on this. It's just that he developed such a fatherly relationship with Maggie and it's kind of odd to see him make the choice he makes. Anyway, the movie earns about a million stars from me, but since I can only give it 10, I guess that will do.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Worthy of its Oscars,"What can you say? Clint Eastwood is like a fine wine that just keeps getting better with age. ""Mystic River"", ""The Bridges of Madison County"", and ""Million Dollar Baby"" from a guy who made spaghetti westerns 40 years ago. Hilary Swank is an ""A"" list actress. This performance was on par with her portrayal in ""Boys Don't Cry."" Then, of course, there is Morgan Freeman. Well, actors just don't come any better than him. Too many great characters in so many outstanding films. ""Shawshank Redemption"", ""Driving Miss Daisy"", ""Bruce Almighty"" and on and on....So, what do you get when you take a great script, a quality actor/director, more quality actors and the big screen to showcase it all? You get one of the best films of the year and a film that will instantly be securely on the list of top films of all time.A great motion picture does not need awesome special effects, loud musical scoring, fad or fashion. It just needs plain old-fashioned quality film making where talented people perform at the top of their craft. Just like films such as ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" or ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""Million Dollar Baby"" will be as much of a gem decades from now as it is today.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Quite simply a knock out,"Clint Eastwood is a unique icon of American cinema whom I have admired even before he reached the big screen when I enjoyed his performances as Rowdie Yates in television's ""Wagon Train"". The longevity of his career (the first of his films as an actor was years 50 ago), the commercial success of his 58 films as an actor (whether as cowboy, cop or comedian) but, above all, the critical success of the 27 movies he has directed (especially the later work such as ""Unforgiven"" and ""Mystic River"") make him a singular figure in the cinematic firmament. In many cases, he has both starred and directed and so it is with ""Million Dollar Baby"" which - at the incredible age of 74 - is set to consolidate his already formidable reputation.I went into the cinema expecting to see ""Rockette"" - a female version of Stallone's triumphalism in the boxing ring - but came out feeling I'd seen ""Who's Fight Is It Anyway?"" - a searing examination of the meaning of life and relationships. Eastwood, as the laconic and irascible boxing trainer Frankie Dunn, and Hilary Swank, as a 32 year old trailer trash waitress who wants to find herself in the ring (she put on 19 lb for the role), are individually commanding but, in their subtle interaction, they are most impressive, as she finds the father who died too early and he connects with the daughter who will not receive his letters.The third character is a friend to each and the one who understands both from the beginning. Morgan Freeman plays Frankie's assistant Scrap in a dual role in which he is also - as he was in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" - the mellow-voiced and knowing narrator. Unusually for this type of movie, a considerable amount of time is focused on the training gym and the actual fight scenes are very different from ""Rocky"": fast, furious, and short. Indeed the fighting is essentially a metaphor for feelings and the whole work is simply a knock out.",,Anonymous,Drama
Better than a million bucks,"Honestly, there was little doubt that this film would be good. With the actors, the director the talent, it was a sure hit. And yet, it still somehow exceeds expectations. First and foremost, Million Dollar Baby is not a boxing film. Yes, boxing is in it. There are boxing matches. Many of the characters are connected because of boxing. But through this the film reaches for so much more than simply telling the story of a boxer and her trainer. Instead, the film ultimately tackles issues of faith, love, life, fate, will, strength and ultimately asks one of the greatest questions of all: what does it mean to live? That's not to say there aren't any cliché's in the film. As hopeful Maggie Fitzgerald goes against all odds to reach her dream of fighting for the world championship there is a hint of familiarity in her efforts that comes in the form of Rocky or real life boxer Jake La Motta (spotlighted in Raging Bull.) Yet, for every cliché there is an original element wholly unique to this story.Moreover, the characters become real. Eastwood's Frankie Dunn begins as a grumpy, old man who wishes not to train Maggie because she is both a girl and too old. Hmm where has this been seen before? But then, it does not end there, and the journey Frankie as well as the rest of the characters face does not lead to familiar territory but rather to a myriad of difficult questions, leaving the viewer with no easy answers. This film does not end with everything tied up in a neat little bow.What Million Dollar Baby does do, though, is leave an impact. Seldom becoming manipulative and always holding a quiet grace, much like in both of Eastwood's previous films Unforgiven and Mystic River, it takes ideas used before and breathes new life into them. The style Eastwood directs with is unmistakable and the emotion he creates unforgettable.Then there is the ending. Recently much controversy has come from some of the choices made by characters at the end of the film, with political commentators condemning the film (Rush Limbaugh is a big example) and some major published reviews even spoiling the end of the film because of its supposed ""political ambitions."" It's unfortunate, and the hubbub is completely silly. Eastwood has said himself that he meant the film as a story, not a quick answer to a political problem of today. Sometimes the characters an actor will play or the story a director will tell aren't necessarily their point of view. That's why acting is called acting; a character is created. A story is told to transport as well as reflect.Furthermore, much of these complaints likely come from people who haven't even seen the film (it's sadly reminiscent of the butchering Martin Scorsese received for his work The Last Temptation of Christ.) Even more ironic is the fact that the very viewpoints of the attackers of this film are brought up and questioned within the narrative itself. Overall, it's best to see Million Dollar Baby without any knowledge of the ending or even the major plot points, and to instead let the film tell its story. This is art, subtle but never compromising, an example of Eastwood at his best and of cinema at it's finest.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Greatest Movie of All Time,"No doubt in my mind... I am an actor and have seen pretty much all of the greats. I looked down the list of IMDb's greatest 250 movies and I've seen about 80 percent of them. There is not doubt anywhere in my body that this is the greatest movie of all time. Clint Eastwood's direction, paired with his excellent acting, not to mention the amazing performances by Hillary Swank and Morgan Freeman make it a clear choice. Eastwood's use of light in this film creates a unique environment that allows us to see the characters how he wanted us to see them. Freeman's narration is very similar to that of his role in ""Shawshank"" and I think he was a perfect casting choice. People who disliked this movie don't understand what makes a movie great and should just stop going to the movies. Your opinion isn't worth while if you can't see the genius of this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Winners are simply willing to do what losers won't,"The above maxim is from a poster in the film's boxing gym, and its presence very cleverly and subtly pertains deeply to what transpires in this movie.Eastwood gets everything right in this one, beginning with Morgan Freeman's eloquent (but yet never overwrought) voice being utilized as the narrative - this in itself is transcendent, immediately elevating the film to mythic heights. And Hilary Swank's Maggie - there are no words to describe what she manages to achieve in this performance, no words could ever begin to do justice to the depths of what she makes us feel. And Eastwood's turn as Frankie is equally brilliant, coming from a place of true, pure and deep understanding of the human condition and all the dark ramifications that implies.The best thing about the film - and another one of the things that elevates it to mythic status - is how there is not one minute detail that doesn't belong; there is nothing on screen that doesn't contribute completely and utterly to the film's power - the amusing banter, for example, is not there to simply kill time or to create comic relief but rather it is intrinsic to the characters, to show their almost-unrelenting heart in the face of monumental adversity. Eastwood has matured magnificently as a director, he has made me a believer after all these years; I could not get home faster to get to IMDb and give this staggeringly heartfelt masterpiece a TEN.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Most powerful movie ever,"""Million Dollar Baby,"" should have a category warning: this movie contains subject matter that may be too powerful for your average, literate viewer to watch, no matter what their age. When I saw ""Mystic River,"" I was amazed, and touched by it; however, I had read the book, so there were no surprises. After seeing ""Million Dollar Baby,"" today, I am compelled to admit that I have never left a movie in a state of shock. The irony of this film was so overwhelming and the message that it sent was so intense that I was almost unable to leave my seat when it was over. Never before have I seen the use of foreshadowing that was so refined that even when I thought I could predict the outcome of the story, I was wrong. If everyone connected to this film doesn't win an Oscar then the system no longer works. Hilary Swank could give Meryl Streep a run for the money. Clint Eastwood has surpassed Hitchcock when it comes to the element of surprise and story telling. Eastwood and Freeman were so finely tuned the score was hardly recognizable. And the title not only summed up the movie brilliantly but at the same time, bordered on being a misnomer. All I need now is to take a long recovery nap and then attempt to appreciate every day to the fullest. When this movie is released on DVD it should come with a set of emotional steak knives.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A million dollar question,"Million Dollar Baby... a good film? Yes. Good enough to be the year's best picture? I have my doubts. Don't think it deserves the best picture Oscar, although the best director, actress and supporting actor awards were richly deserved.Clint Eastwood has always been an intense character, whether in his acting or in his film-making. He displays his vast directing experience and channels it out well through his own, as well as his co-stars' acting performances. Hilary Swank once again shows that she is in complete control and command of the tough characters she takes on, snagging another Oscar after Boys Don't Cry. The danger though is that she runs the risk of being typecast for such masculine roles and limits her versatility, thus restricting her from taking on other roles. To me, Morgan Freeman is the one who truly deserves his accolade. It's tough to find such a humble and well-respected actor in plastic Hollywood, and even tougher for him to put in such understated but highly influential and impressionable presence in every show he has been in. His superb touches in gems such as the Shawshank Redemption and Driving Miss Daisy alone more than makes up for the many crap films he has taken a part in.So why is it that the film, with masterful directing and convincing performances from the actors, fail to stir up my emotions? I hope I have the answer, but even I'm stumped. It's just one of those movies that has almost everything, yet a vital 'something' is lacking and leaves you feeling not completely satisfied with it. Perhaps it's the way the show gradually ended... it could have taken a tad too long, which could have taken away much of the emotional impact it had intended to make.Who should watch: Fans of superb acting and audiences with the patience to sit through lenghty and intense dialogueWho shouldn't watch: Boxing fans, because there isn't really that much punching going onRating: 7.9",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
A film about boxing is not really about it at all.,"A film about boxing is not really about it at all. Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby is more about a father Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) dealing with an estranged daughter and about the same crusty trainer facing an aggressive young female boxer, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank). The intersection of Frankie's personal and professional lives is deftly drawn in the parallel plots.Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman) narrates, as Freeman does so well in Shawshank Redemption, about Frankie's boxing gym, where Freeman, a former boxer and best friend of Frankie, works and lives. Freeman has the right melancholic but authoritarian voice, the kind Michael Caine uses so well in Cider House Rules that relays acceptance of fate with a generous supply of humanity. Frank quietly endures boxers leaving him for a better chance, old age, and the importuning of young boxers who wants a chance at success. Along with Maggie comes a trailer-park family that tests Frankie's essentially peaceful nature, one nurtured by reading Gaelic.Director Eastwood's style is minimalist, essentially a three-person drama set in spare locales like the clean and uncluttered gymnasium. Although not black and white, the color film plays down color to give it a '40's film noir feeling. Cinematographer Tom Stern (chief lighting technician for Road to Perdition) uses dark and light shadows like a 16th century portrait painter. At times I thought I was watching Hopper's diner come alive with these marginal but never dull characters.While the dialogue is rarely poetic, it is muscular in its spareness, just enough to get the point across. With weathered faces like Eastwood's and taut beauty like Swank's, not much more is needed but a close-up camera and editing to reduce the fat to that muscle. When Maggie from southwest Missouri describes the life she left, the language is tough poetry: ""I might as well go back home and buy a used trailer and get a deep fryer and some Oreos."" I was drawn into the drama far more than any other film of 2004, because the story was common but powerful and the Oscar-worthy performers reached the right notes, and not a note more. The best picture of '04 by a knockout.",,Anonymous,Drama
"10 out of 10, all-time great","Hey everybody, this past Saturday, I saw ""Million Dollar Baby"", a film starring Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, and Morgan Freeman. I wanted to just let you all know how much I enjoyed the film, and let you know I highly recommend it, and the reasons why....I am not some big time film critic, but I do feel as though I have a good sense of what a genuienly good film is....Million Dollar Baby exceeded my expectations in so many ways, there is no doubt in my mind it is the best movie of 2004.I'm going to start of by saying ""Million Dollar Baby"" is one of the best movies you could ever see. From start to finish, it has all the key elements that every great film should have.A+ actors, who deliver top notch acting, a gripping, compelling story(which is based on true events, by the way), interesting characters, and a story filled with amazing dramatics, full of emotions, and heart.I believe one critic said it best: "" The kind of movie where you sit very quietly in the theater and are drawn deeply into lives that you care very much about. "" There is much more to this movie then ""it's just a boxing movie."" Million Dollar Baby at it's core, is a movie dealing with guilt, responsibility for risk, and determination to do what you believe is right.Hilary Swank is incredible. She firmly establishes herself as a top leading actress in the business for years to come in this.Don't listen to what anyone else has to say about Million Dollar Baby. Do not let anyone tell you anything that happens, or spoil the ending for you, go see it for yourself.It's one of the very few movies I've seen in recent memory that I would confidently recommend everyone to go see.I give it a 10 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"A must see, in my humble opinion","""It is what it is"", watch it for yourself before you judge it based on what someone else says about it.

But not all of us are bent on dissecting everything we see and analyzing its meaning. I took my two sons, One who is 17, the other who is 14. Both did not really want to see it based on what they saw in a commercial.I really had to talk the oldest into going and forced the youngest. After the movie I could tell it really had an effect on them. They both will tell you it wasn't what they thought it was.

Uplifting Yet Sad..Not typical Eastwood Fare...,"this is the kind of movie you have to see only once. Not like any of Clint Eastwoods other movies, either as director or actor, where the 25th viewing is as enjoyable as the first! This one hits you so deep in the gut(pardon the boxing pun) that once is definitely plenty. You will most likely never forget it. There have been only a few movies so sad and so heartfelt that the emotional chord it strikes leaves you in such a state you don't want to go there again. Kind of like a funeral for someone you loved. I sincerely admire Hillary Swank as an actress. Her 2 most amazing roles that both won her Oscars, have her dying in the end. She does it better than anyone. She has a humanity to her roles that reminds me of Audrey Hepburn at her best. The only other actress I know today that has this same quality is Natalie Portman. Watch her amazing performance at the age of 13 in The Professional. It is like she and Hillary are cast from the same amazing mold. MDB is a great movie. It may have an ending some may not agree is right, but it fits. It almost seemed like 2 different movies. A Rocky type of story at first, then a story about the issue of life.

Fine until insincere final reel,"Hilary Swank plays Maggie Fitzgerald, a gutsy bundle of spit and verve who wants more than anything in the entire known universe to be a boxing champeen. So she takes her novice skill level to Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), notable trainer of he-man boxers. Noting that Maggie's not really male, Frankie treats her with a lot of disdain and disrespect, but grudgingly - with the help of his canny janitor/man-at-arms, Scrap (Morgan Freeman) agrees to train Maggie. At least until she can find a manager. Which she never does.Swank again gets the Oscar nod (she also won for Boys Don't Cry), but this isn't her show at all - it's that of the two old codgers, Eastwood and Freeman. Freeman's excellence finally gets the level of recognition it deserves, as he won an Oscar, too, and Eastwood won for Best Director.The first three-quarters of the movie is pretty standard little-punk-against-all-the-odds fare, kind of a step or two above The Karate Kid, but along the same lines. Scrap and Frankie impart wisdom both practical and metaphysical to Maggie, who nods and flashes the largest set of teeth this side of a sabre-toothed tiger. Seriously, Hilary should look into getting those things capped or chiseled down, or something. Swank's job is to look innocent and deserving, but still appear skillful and eager to learn more. Eastwood and Freeman just need to look smart and worldly, not to mention world-weary. All succeed in these broad characterizations.The final quarter of the movie, though, takes us on a sharp left turn away from the norm. I won't give away the plot turn - it's not a twist, just a turn - but it quickly moves the tone of the movie from inspirational to sappy, from Rocky to Lifetime cable movies. As the audience, we're supposed to feel for Maggie, no matter what happens, and that almost works against things here; Maggie Fitzgerald is shown as a saint, quite frankly. Everything she does seems to be right, or at least Well Intentioned, and most people on the planet aren't quite that ethereal.Still, it's tough not to root for the little dickens. Maggie's feisty and is determined to succeed; no small feat, considering she's scrawny even after a couple years of self-training. She's motivated by having been told how much of a loser she is throughout her life (she's 31 when the movie begins); if she's unsuccessful as a fighter, she has nothing else to do, nowhere else to go. Presumably, anyway. She's waitressing, after all, and does have a job when she begins training with Frankie, so she's really not as bad off as she wants to appear.The chemistry between the toothy Swank and the toothless Eastwood should have been fantastic - Oscar winners both, of course - but for me their verbal interplay fell flat. I felt like I was watching two people do a cold reading. On the other hand, old pros Eastwood and Freeman played off each other perfectly, for dramatic and comedic effects. Their scenes together - and one gets the impression that Freeman's Scrap Iron wasn't as huge a character in the original version of the script - were flawless and highly enjoyable to watch, sort of like seeing a married couple interact.As with most athletics-related movies, Million Dollar Baby will try to manipulate you, and it's fairly successful in that arena. However, the final reel of the movie just didn't completely work for me, seeming more like a disease-of-the-week teleplay than an Academy Award-winning movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Clint will never let us down!,"There's something that characterizes Clint Eastwood's films: he usually makes a nice movie out of a simple story. Anyone else would have converted Million Dollar Baby into such a TV Movie or something, kind of a ""Karate Kid"" mixed up with a moral conflict. Nevertheless Eastwood has a steady hand, he's tough when he thinks he has to, and he's spectacular when he thinks the story can afford it. Once again he plays the lead role: the cynical-skeptical-heartless old man unable to feel anything for anyone  till he finally does. Someone will say Clint Eastwood can only play one character; OK, maybe that's true: but he is the best playing it. Hillary Swank makes a great job, bringing to life that white-trash-boxer-aspiring (the first time she participates in such a nice project since ""Boys Don't Cry"").A good movie as was to be expected if Clint Eastwood is behind and in front of the camera.

Mark of a Great Storyteller,"I was in no hurry to see MILLION DOLLAR BABY. I am not a fan of boxing films, and I still think the title is less than stellar. And after seeing it, I haven't changed my opinion that ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND is the best film I've seen so far in the 21st century.But number two of the century for me is now MILLION DOLLAR BABY.It's not the story itself that makes this such a great film. The story with it's surface emphasis on underdogs and redemption is actually fairly routine. It is the way Clint Eastwood tells this story, the way he gets such understated yet magnificent performances from his cast, the brilliant use of lighting, of story pacing through editing, his unobtrusive but highly effective music...This film is a textbook example of the best of film storytelling that should be studied by film students in this generation and the next. And the next, and the next...This is not a film about boxing. This is a film about human beings, their hopes, fears, flaws, and potential for transcendent greatness, sometimes through staggering self-sacrifice. It is told with such love and compassion for the human condition that it gives me a little much-needed faith that maybe the human race is still capable of more than the mundane goals it seems to be setting for itself lately.The supporting performances are uniformly excellent. But the three leads reach levels of acting on a par with any great performance you'd care to name in film history. I have not been a Hilary Swank fan. But her work here forces me to acknowledge that she is one of the best in her profession. And just when I thought Morgan Freeman couldn't get any better, here he is with the best performance I have ever seen from him. And considering his past work, that is really saying something.And speaking of best performances, here the legendary Clint Eastwood crowns his career with a titanic performance that redefines him as an actor for the ages. And trust me, the fact that he did it while simultaneously having to spend so much time and loving care on this film as a director makes his work as an actor all the more amazing. Consider this, too: if MDB had been someone else's film, would that director or producer even have thought to cast him in this role?I didn't really expect to be saying these things about this film.

The pairs relationship grows and it becomes clear that Frankie may have found the long lost daughter he's been looking for. The two are all each other have, and one horrific incident results in them facing a battle tougher than what they could ever face in a boxing ring.I couldn't take my eyes off this movie and I was very moved by the performances.

Rocky: The Debbie Downer Version,"""Million Dollar Baby"" is a lean, mean, fighting machine of a movie, pulling no punches and throwing no towels. It stars Clint Eastwood as a ringside ""cut man,"" Morgan Freeman as his gym manager buddy, and Hilary Swank as a struggling waitress who seeks glory in the sweet science.I wish I could say I loved it. I think I liked it, because the acting is awesomely good and the story has its moments. It's a film with merit. But there are people in the world who like movies like this and ""Terms Of Endearment"" and ""Rocket Gibraltar"" because they like movies that make them feel. ""Million Dollar Baby"" made me feel, too, feel confused at what the dialogue was on screen in the latter part of the picture with all the sniffling in the theater.Eastwood as a director has a definite style, one that complements his acting métier. Terse lines, acerbically delivered. Some laughs, preferably dry ones. Camera-work that tends to the dark and monochromatic. ""Million Dollar Baby"" as a story suits his direction well.Eastwood as an actor has never let go the way he does here. He's awesome in several scenes, quietly breaking apart. He has to give it all he's got, though, because he's working opposite Hilary Swank, who just tears your heart out with those eyes, that big-toothed grin, and the way she delivers lines like ""You gotta do me a favor, boss."" There's a scene with her just sitting in a car, making eye contact with a little girl and her dog from across a gas pump, and that wordless scene is probably the best piece of acting in any film this year. Freeman is good, too, reading comic books and working on getting his friend to warm to the girl with the gloves.The rest of the supporting cast is disappointingly one note. Swank's Maggie Fitzgerald has a trailer-trash family who wear their nastiness like tourist-trap T-shirts. No subtlety. There's a priest that glowers at Eastwood's Frankie Dunn and his wry questioning in such a way one wonders how he handles hearing confessions, and one nasty German boxing opponent who does everything short of don a swastika in the ring.The story is kind of rote, too, all very montage and quickly edited to discourage deep thought. Just what does this boxer find in ""Boss"" Frankie to make her suddenly so powerful in the ring? I know, you say the power of love. But there has to be something more, and it's lightly explained.So is the run for a boxing title, which is handled in a way that feels like Cliff Notes, with a series of one-punch knockouts from Fitzgerald that neither ring true nor set up the dramatic tension needed to propel the story past the rags-to-riches cliché. There's also some business with some characters around the gym, like a mentally retarded man who gets picked on, but it's so truncated with the focus on the Fitzgerald story it feels like the padding it no doubt is.I think the main performances are so incredible, they carry the rest of the film with them. In time, though, people may not be as wowed with ""Million Dollar Baby"" as they are now.""Million Dollar Baby"" is good, solid entertainment through the first two thirds, then takes a very challenging turn that probably cost it some admirers. It's very engaging, and then it tears you up, and you will carry the experience of seeing the film for a long time, longer than maybe you want to. You can't fault a film for making you sad, or for being manipulative. But I think the films that endure are the ones that don't forcefeed you with emotions the way you are fed them here.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Extremely moving,"Clint Eastwood has done it again. Tough, violent and extremely moving. Million dollar baby is his best third work before the camera, (I think his first was Unforgiven, and his second Bird- unbelievably underrated-). Eastwood knows about boxing movies, and He knows that black and white is the best to shoot a boxing movie, but he also knows that nowadays everybody remember excellent Ranging Bull, so He tries a new way to shoot it: Lights and shadows. He creates the atmosphere with lights and shadows in the gym and in hospital scenes. It's an old game that Eastwood plays along the movie. But he has another trick... A great storyline. And Eastwood, a very good director, turns a typical boxing movie into a powerful losers drama which would make Eastwood himself cry. The best American movie of this 2005 Oscar, very far away from dull and dusty The Aviator.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Clint Eastwood's Million ""Duller"" Baby","Like ""Mystic River"", ""Million Dollar Baby"" confuses in-your-face melodrama with profoundness. Subtlety is definitely not one of Eastwood's directorial strengths. The film also has its motley crew of caricature characters like Maggie's obnoxious ""white trash"" family who act more like her personal demons than anything. They live only to swing the pendulum of sympathy towards Maggie in very neatly demarcated zones of good and evil.But sympathy is difficult to give when it is so obviously solicited. Characters wallowing in contrived dramas hardly elicit interest, let alone sympathy. As respected film critic Roger Ebert pointed out, ""Deep movie emotions for me usually come not when the characters are sad, but when they are good."" In ""Million Dollar Baby,"" the characters are more sad than good.Nonetheless, the film won awards for Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Director. This is not about the Academy paying tribute to a future film classic, it is about the Academy paying its last respects to its favorite 74-year-old cowboy. True enough, in the film's last moments, the Frankie character disappears.Ultimately, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is ""Rocky""(Progesterone version) meets ""Terms of Endearment"" (plus the narration cut-and pasted from ""The Shawshank Redemption""). How's that for cinematic schizophrenia?",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
The best by the best,"Clint Eastwood has put together a body of work of acting, directing and producing that is unequalled by any other ""Hollywood"" personage. His latest, Million Dollar Baby, is the best of all of the wonderful things he had done over the years. This film has the power to move the viewer to the core of your soul, and you become one with the three central characters and the story, which is not about boxing, but about love. But what should leave you awestruck is what Eastwood is able to get from Hilary Swank.....a performance that will rank as one of the all time greats, and one which will stay with you long after you have left the theater.....her face and her voice and her grit and loyalty seem enbedded in your consciousness for day, and you cannot shake it. If you love film, you must see Million Dollar Baby, you will love Hilary Swank's Maggie MacGuire beyond words, and you will be equally moved by the chemistry between Eastwood, Swank and Freeman which has produced one of the most stunning and powerful movies I have seen----and I started with him when he was Rowdy Yates......oh, how far he has come, and how much I have loved the ride with Clint, I only hope that moviegoers will appreciate what this man has given the art of film over his long and distinguished career...Thank you Clint",,Anonymous,Drama
Brilliant!!,"This is a kind of a movie you want to keep in your collections, because these kind never gets old.Hilary Swank gave out her best performance yet. It's a performance you want to see holding an Oscar. Beautiful script and an excellent story. Eastwood knew exactly how far to stretch the tragedy, which he might have missed in the Mystic River.A smooth touch by some very strong performances from the supporting actors like Freeman and Baruchel get every bit of the beginning of the movie going. And when Swank takes it off, it's all about her. The movie shows how the character grows in mental strength with every fight and breaks apart with just one truth. Swank's performance was so great along with the script that you don't even feel the change until it was obvious.I personally think it was better than Raging Bull. I think it connects you emotionally more to the character than the Bull's. All in all a great entertainer and a must see movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Million Dollar Movie!,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. For me it ranks up there with The Shawshank Redemption. If you loved Shawshank, I promise you, you will love this. Both movies handle a subject we have seen many times before and do it so well that you can not imagine how it could ever be done any better. In this case, the done-to-death story-line is about a fighter who wants to get her shot at the title and the hard-headed trainer who reluctantly takes her on. Don't be fooled by the story-line though. This is no Rocky. Million Dollar Baby is to Rocky as a diamond is to some cheap quartz imitation.Hilary Swank creates such a believable character you'll have a hard time thinking she was acting. I hope to see her in the Oscars in some designer dress with a two-thousand dollar hair-do. I will be glad in more ways than one since it will destroy my image of her as an honest, hard-working, tough and yet vulnerable woman worth loving.Morgan Freeman is absolutely and utterly wonderful, again, as usual.As for Clint Eastwood. Well, some actors and directors get better with age. Clint Eastwood isn't just getting better. He is so far ahead of his contemporaries already he'll have to cut off an arm (well maybe both arms and possibly a leg) to let the others catch up with him.After seeing this movie I thought about it a long time trying to understand why it had such an emotional effect on me. Deep down I guess its about choosing your road in life and going where it takes you. No complaints. No regrets. What really hits home is the love the characters have for one another. The sort of love you reserve for people who walked down that road with you. The people who you'd want to be with in your final moments.I can not understand the mind-set of people who voted 1 for this movie. I can only guess they are other movie directors.

Glad I Changed My Mind!,"I wasn't going to see this film - I thought I could wait until its DVD release. THEN, my aunt came over and raved about it. I was so curious that I went out the very next day and saw it.Million Dollar Baby is an amazing story and I really liked it. I just think Hilary Swank can pick a winner of a script when she sees one! She may not be Hollywood's top actress, or even in a lot of films - but the ones she does appear in are awesome! I am only 21 years old, and usually right into comedies and the like, but this is a movie that I will definitely see again. I cried.I rated this film 9/10 - but it may be even better than that.

No gratuitous sex but eye-averting violence,"Well it is nearly always one or the other isn't it. Mostly I don't care for Clint Eastwood, though he can be terrific - ""Play Misty for Me"" being one example that comes to mind, but here he gives a performance that is completely believable, low-key and complex.Here he plays Frankie Dunn, an older boxing coach and manager of a tacky male-only boxing gym. He goes to daily Mass and argues with the parish priest about matters of faith, he learns Gaelic and he keeps an old boxer, his helper (who is the narrator of the movie)living in a small room off the gym floor. Frankie is buttoned down, does not show his emotion but we are given hints that life has been hard on him, relationships have been destroyed and broken.Maggie Fitzgerald (played by Hilary Swank)comes on the scene. She's a thirty-something hillbilly woman from southwest Missouri with a big dream which is nearly impossible to attain, she is too old, too broke and a woman to boot. But she inveigles her way into the gym and practically lives there, training incessantly.I will not spoil the outcome, it works its way into your heart without being melodramatic or over the top Hollywood.Hilary's performance is just as good as it was in ""boys Don't Cry"", she seems to immerse herself in these one of a kind roles and you are literally stunned at what she can do with them. I cannot imagine anyone else playing Maggie.Morgan Freeman does a wonderful turn as Dunn's right-hand man, but it is Clint't direction and performance that puts the stamp of overall excellence on this movie. 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Rather overrated, but still a good film","Every once and a while, and sometimes even more often than that, there comes a film that critics practically drool over. Erupting headlines shoot like geysers from The New York Times, Rotten Tomatoes, and IMDb. I get excited when there's a film like this, because I'm excited to see it and get my own opinions on it. Unfortunately, many times, I don't exactly like the film. For 2004, that film is Million Dollar Baby.Hilary Swank plays Maggie Fitzgerald, a southern 31-year-old from Missouri who has come from a broken home, and has one dream: to win the title of a boxing championship. Clint Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, the acclaimed boxing manager. ""I don't train girls,"" is Dunn's immediate reflex once Maggie asks him to train her. Eventually, Dunn takes her as a trainee and eventually manages her boxing career, and the two of them begin an extremely strong, non-romantic emotional bond as Maggie advances towards her dream.Of course, there's more complex elements to the story than that, but really, that's it in a nutshell. For some reason, I believe that the all-star cast (Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood, and Morgan Freeman) helped bring this mediocre film to it's blockbuster status, and also helped it go on to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards. Yes, you'll hear critics say it's ""Remarkable"" and ""The best film of the year"" but none of them will ever say ""Unique."" Quite simply, because, there is nothing original about this film at all. There are so many films about someone going after their dreams I've lost count, and frankly, most of them are better and less appreciated than Million Dollar Baby.Of course, there are some huge highpoints this film has hit. One--Clint Eastwood really was the right choice for director. He did a superb job with the film, made it detailed without making it boring, and made it an easier film to watch without having to concentrate super-hard like you're taking the SATs in high school. Two--Paul Haggis's incredibly talented writing skills shine through like rays of sun through a thin white bed sheet in this film. It's not so much that the screenplay was original, funny, and creative like the Oscar-winning one of Little Miss Sunshine, but it was so extraordinarily well written and the dialogue is extremely realistic. Three--astounding performances by Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood, and Morgan Freeman (in my opinion, ALL of them worthy of Oscars) bring the film to its feet. Mixed with Paul Haggis's exquisitely written screenplay, it's almost like you're watching a documentary. And in no way is that a bad thing! Now we'll go back to the negative points for a bit. My least favourite thing about Million Dollar Baby is the ending. I can't really say much without ruining the film for you, but it was evident they were going for a very emotional and hard-hitting ending. Unfortunately, I didn't feel it. I get very emotional at sad films and am considered a rather emotional person, but the ending felt very rushed, overworked, and sloppily done. If they had spent another few weeks working on the ending, the ending alone would have made this film a classic.Overall--don't get me wrong. This is a GOOD film. It's just very overrated, and in my opinion, isn't deserving of all people say it's cut out to be. And definitely not worthy of the Best Picture Oscar.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Here Here Clint Eastwood,"It just doesn't seem possible that Clint Eastwood of Sergio Leon who acted in Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, and the Good, the Bad and the Ugly can direct such a different kind of movies which I like as well such as Bridges of Madison County, Mystic River, Changeling and Millioin Dollar Baby.The movie is just awesome! A good story with a wonderful actor Hillary Swank. She is playing a challenging role because such roles are usually prepared for men but Hillary is so good that even men admired her in this role.

"Overrated  and over hyped, typical of Hollywood","I heard so much hype about this movie with the Oscar and all I decided to see it against my better judgment about Hollywood's history of awarding bad movies top awards. Unfortunately, the movie, while entertaining and fairly acted, failed to impress me, not to mention live up to its hype. I continue to be puzzled by Hollywood's award giving standards.The story is very typical and too simple. Hilary Swank is a highly motivated woman from a very trashy family with a very unlikely dream of becoming a female boxing champion. She seeks the help of a very skeptical trainer Frankie (Eastwood) who eventually believes in her and trains her. Of course she did not disappoint him and quickly rose to the top (way too quickly) to face the evil German boxer. They unnecessarily over demonized Swank's family and the German boxer, a cheap way to glorify and gain sympathy for the main characters. I never understood why Swank's character has such an unrealistic passion for boxing (very rare for a woman). The movie never really explored her motive other than the fact that her family was quite mean. The movie, while well directed, never developed into a true boxing story. It was like they were trying to remake Rocky, the female version of it, but failed to bring the realism and emotions of Rocky. I never really understood the point behind that movie. May be someone or some people are attempting to promote female boxing. Swank is a fine actress and she did a good job portraying a boxer despite her soft and feminine quality. Eastwood did not fit the part of a boxing trainer who is a loner with an odd relationship with Freeman that included a mixture of guilt and regrets. He was acting more like a cop than a true boxing trainer. Freeman's character, a very wise and calm washed out boxer, was typical of every Freeman role I've seen. I think his in good company with Eastwood, they both lack acting versatility. They are only good for one role. The movie never really took off and it almost ended as it started, except with fewer characters.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

Both, Hilary and Clint did an excellent job. They didn't seem like they were acting, it seemed so real and natural. I hope she gets the Oscar again. She just put all her emotions there. I have to say that she was as good in this movie like when she did Boys Don't Cry. Although I haven't seen Being Julia and Annette Benning performance in that movie. I've heard a lot of people saying that it was really good. I also liked Cate Blanchett as Kate Hepburn.

An absolutely terrific film!!!,"I love Clint Eastwood. He is a genius and definitely put together a masterpiece this time.

Oh, and it was great to see Morgan Freeman finally put the jinx behind him and bag a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Plot...The movie is basically about a woman who dreams of becoming someone and the road she takes to get there. She ironically teams up with the manager who is notorious for not getting to the big match and gains inspiration from a washed-up fighter who has resorted to cleaning and living in a gym. How does she make her dreams come true. You'll have to see and find out.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Excellent Performances,"""Million Dollar Baby"" is perfectly cast --- the actors take on their parts and make them their own. The story is about a white trash girl, Maggie, who wants to make something of herself and believes that boxing is her calling. She seeks out Frankie to train her at the gym, but he refuses to take her on at first. At first you think Frankie's sexist, but his character is not that simple. The story builds steadily and you later realize Frankie has many good reasons not to train Maggie, but her spirit and dedication win him over eventually. Frankie ties himself emotionally to each person he trains and tries his best to make them champions. Morgan Freeman is excellent as Scrap the gym's custodian and his intelligence and ability to decipher Frankie even surprises Frankie. Scrap reminds me of a man I met one time at my company who earned a purple heart in the Vietnam War, but spent his days sorting mail in the mail room. Surely, this veteran had more to offer the world or maybe I just didn't understand that he had experienced and accomplished more than most people do in a lifetime. I think the situation is the same with Scrap -- being at the gym doing whatever is still immensely satisfying to him. How many people can say they'd want to live at their place of work like Scrap?! Hillary Swank is wonderful as Maggie and Clint Eastwood... well what's not to like? The man is brilliant in every way -- acting, directing, writing, and so soft spoken in real life that you love and respect him even more.I also was immensely impressed by the minor players in the film, especially the actor who plays Maggie's mother, Margo Martindale. She is just excellent in her supporting role. Lucia Rijker is also fantastic as ""Billie the Blue Bear"". She is one tough lady! It wasn't until I watched the behind the scenes footage that I saw how pretty she is off screen.One minor problem I can see with the film is the diction and audibility -- I couldn't understand everything Scrap said and had to use the subtitles feature on the DVD player. I understood all of his narration, but not some of his lines when he appeared on film. My complaint sounds like nitpicking and that's not my intention.Finally, it is great to finally see a major film about women's boxing. I didn't know the women's version is just as violent as the men's. I am quite surprised boxing headgear is not worn in women's or men's boxing. Boxing with your bare head makes no sense when you see how many injuries are sustained such as concussions, broken eardrums, detached retinas, and such. The sport makes complaining about a broken nose sound like you're complaining about a broken finger nail. I've heard some of Muhammad Ali's present health condition is attributed to numerous blows to his head during his boxing years.Overall this is an excellent film and well worth the time viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Million Dollar Movie,"I went to see Million Dollar Baby tonight, and it was incredible. Clint Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, a Boxing Trainer and Manager who is nearing the end of his career. Frank is plagued with an inability to take risks, which is the Motus Operandi of boxing itself, leaving him with no real accomplishments to take credit for. He is given one last chance at doing something great with his life when he is faced with Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), an aging female wanna be boxer with little trade skill, but a whole lot of heart and natural talent.I am not a huge fan of Clint Eastwood's earlier films (as a director), I think they are a little too clichéd and Dirty Harry-Esq. But somewhere along the line he managed to take a deep breathe and develop his own style of direction that is absolute art. I used to be only a fan of a movie that had some sort of cleverness about it, now every movie you see tries to be clever in someway. But maybe the cleverness of Million Dollar Baby, is that it doesn't try to be clever.The artistic direction in Million Dollar Baby is amazing. Clint has grown an ability to transmute the world as we know it into a modern Norman Rockwell painting. Everything piece of set dec in the movie, no matter how torn up or battered it may be... seems to be beautiful. It is like this gossamer shroud of old fashion imagery, draped over the entire set. Clint has Morgan Freeman narrating the movie, and he does just as amazing as in The Shawshank Redemption. Every protaganistic characters seem to have so much honor, and command respect from the viewer, especially when they are held in contrast to the bad guys in the film. It really REALLY makes you root for the main character, and has that much more impact when disaster strikes. Trust me ... you start cheering for Maggie as she beats the crap out of people :D The character development is absolutely amazing in this movie, and possibly it's strongest feature. Clint develops the characters and their relationships so well, that you can feed solely off their body language. There are moments of silence in the movie, and although nothing is being said, you feel as if the characters are still speaking.I absolutely loved this movie, all performances and characters are awesome.

Don't read this review. Or any other.,"If you have not seen this movie, and you have any intention of doing so, see it right now. Stop reading. Reading about it will spoil it.I make no claims about the brilliance or mediocrity of this film, nor about Eastwood's direction, his acting, Swank's acting, Freeman's acting, or anything else. Simply: if you find out too much about it, or become biased, either for or against it, you will be very sad indeed when you actually see it.This film follows in the footsteps of Big Fish, Mulholland Dr., and In the Bedroom, in the sense that they need to be experienced before they can be discussed. Talking about the plot points of Mulholland Dr. without having seen it will take away the visceral experience that Lynch has created. Similarly, while Million Dollar Baby might be similar to /blank/, or follow the plot of /blank/, or be ""about"" /blank/, you have to see it with an open and uncluttered mind to understand why.Many viewers, understandably, only see movies after reading all the reviews of it first.

Even Better After It Sits,"While watching this, I knew I was seeing a film that was completely engaging. It was paced really well and was top-heavy with wonderful performances. Eastwood is of the school of direction that favors substance over style, yet this film uses shadows and light as tools better than any film I can think of in the last 30 years (Since The Godfather). He also gives, here, his best performance ever. His is a risky performance, as an actor he pushes himself into emotional territory he had only touched on before. Hillary Swank is quite a bit of terrific, as well in a role that is solidly wonderful. She isn't stretching the same way Eastwood is, but is gritty and brave. Morgan Freeman is, like Swank, ""typically"" good, not reaching as far, but when you're Morgan Freeman, you really do not have to. The film is about choices and consequences, and, three days after seeing this, I cannot stop thinking about the implications of the last twenty-five minutes or so. The sign of a great film is what it does to you after it has a chance to settle in. On that basis alone, this ranks towards the top of a Master Director's list of Great Films. The movie hits you, yet the sting lingers long after. I mean that in the best possible manner.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Million Dollar Baby is a great film,"I went to see this last night and was enthralled. There will be the comparisons to Rocky, but as a fight film this is closer to Raging Bull. Unlike the villainous tragedy of Deniro's Jake LaMatta, though, Eastwood and Swank both portray tragic heroes who are beautiful in their dignified, but inevitably doomed struggle. This film takes the viewer to a deep, uncomfortable place where no one would go unless compelled. Compelling is only one word to describe this movie, though. Masterful and artistic, while at the same time touchingly human, and ultimately, tragically real.Like many great sports movies, Million Dollar Baby transcends its subject, and sport itself. This film is about respect, and pride, and dignity.Rocky leaves the audience in the ring, and one has to remind himself that Balboa lost the fight. Million Dollar Baby consumes the viewer with loss, making us watch painfully as the story winds up. If there was bittersweet triumph in Rocky, there is subtle, quiet, and touching triumph here, that is unquestionably more real. Sadly, some stories just do not have happy endings. I have heard this film called ""depressing"", though, and I cannot agree. Sad, yes. Humbling and perhaps disturbing, but there was victory here and Swank gives an inspiring performance.I have not seen the other films nominated for Best picture, or for some of the other awards, but this should win something.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Good parts but the pieces don't quite fit together,"In this drama, Clint Eastwoods character reluctantly becomes the trainer of a lonely woman (Hilary Swank), who is actually too old to become a boxer.The acting is superb, the characters very interesting, the career and the training of the main character as a boxer is a fantastic and moving story to follow. The production, the music, the pictures are all flawless. This movie is worth watching indeed.But the movie is uneven and the pieces don't quite fit together. The separate parts are very very good, but they make no sense in the same movie.Why o why o why did they have to put on a narrator voice, especially as it is Morgan Freeman who tells the story, and we have already heard this exact narrator tone from him in ""The Shawshank Redemption"". It adds possibly nothing to the story.I have nothing against the sadness of the ending. But this whole long last part adds so little to the story, it is sad for the sadness sake sometimes. There were so much more to get here, and it could be much much more connected to the story in general. As now, the end almost feels like a separate movie.There are more unsatisfactory left out pieces. Many touching stories and people are thrown into the story, but too little is known, too little explored and too unconnected to the main story or some theme of the movie, for their story to capture you as they could have.But overall the movie is good and worth watching.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
I usually don't enjoy sad movies. . .,"I like to think that I'm not particularly fast to choose a film for the ""best film""/ ""favorite film"" title. However, I woke up this morning after seeing the film and remembered watching it last night. The movie stuck in my head for some reason, and it may be the best I've ever seen.The best thing going for it is the power of Morgan Freeman's voice as a narrator. I truly enjoyed Shawshank Redemption, and this film went further to show the power of his voice.However, the true strength in the film is the run-of-the mill young boxer/ old weary trainer bit, but pushed to the next level. The film goes beyond boxing itself, to a much more human and realistic perspective.The movie doesn't try to develop ALL characters, but concentrates well on just three.

"Aviator, Schmaviator....Go see what it takes to live life without a trailer, a deep fryer, and some Oreos.","I swore I would not write another review, but here goes. Given my history, I will probably not write one again for another two years (my average). That should be a blessing to anyone reading my previous entries.I am a sucker for good stories, particularly ones about ordinary people attempting extraordinary things. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is one of those films, and because Clint Eastwood knows how to cast, how to act, and how to get out of the way of the actors he uses, this film makes for a great story even if you don't like the conclusions ( and for ethical reasons, I didn't).Anything I say about this film will spoil its impact but suffice it to say, Morgan Freeman, Hillary Swank, and Clint Eastwood do a great job telling a tale about how people work around their personal limitations to achieve their dreams and how to deal with the options when those dreams fall apart. The boxing business, particularly women's' boxing, is simply the canvas around which such issues are played out. Through this canvas, the characters figure out the meaning of love, loss, separation, and courage in a style that is truly enjoyable and memorable.I am sure that this picture will not win Best Picture at the Oscars because those cinematic elitists will assume that it is a stylistic mimeograph (now you know how old I AM) of ""The Shawshank Redemption"". Morgan Freeman even narrates this film as he did that one. I promise you that this movie is not ""Clone of Shawshank"". Paul Haggis' screenplay is friendly, funny, and for the most part not ad-libbed. There is enough humor and realistic pathos to carry one though 137 minutes without being bored in the process. Hillary Swank puts in an admirable performance as a girl without a dime and with a dream. Eastwood and Freeman interact classically with one another as trainer and former boxer and confidant. Their banter and one-liners are both poignant and funny. Eastwood is also good (though kind of predictable as in previous offerings) as a trainer who has made many mistakes in life for which he seeks redemption and from which he can never fully recover. Freeman is as comfortable as an old shoe as the has-been heavyweight who still holds the heavyweight title in common sense, courage, and character.I won't say anything more that this. I despised greatly the ending of this film. If you feel the same way I do about some fundamental issues, you will also despise it. That being said, the issues being presented might be one reason why one should SEE this film. It will certainly be a cause for frank discussion with your family, significant other, or friends.

The most human film in years,"After reading all the reviews, I still did not know what to expect out of ""Million Dollar Baby"" (""MDB""). Was it a female ""Rocky""? Or was it about relationships? Well, after watching this film last night, I have to say that this is one of those films that is more about people and human nature than anything else.Clint Eastwood as a film maker has done what few actor/directors have done: make a succession of films that have gotten more mature and better with age. He started tackling complicated issues such as murder, mythology, and feminism with ""Unforgiven"" (which almost single-handedly deconstructed the Western genre), and then went after other great dramas with ""Mystic River"", ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"", and ""The Bridges of Madison County"". However, Mr. Eastwood has proved to be a master of exploring humans with ""Million Dollar Baby"" If I was to summarize this film, I'd give a lot of the movie away and ruin the experience. So let me clarify a few things to get you prepared. It is not a female ""Rocky""--""Rocky"" was about a chance of a lifetime; ""MDB"" is more complicated, exploring themes of determination, taking chances, and courage. Secondly, it is only partially about boxing. While we do learn about the intricacies of boxing, it does a better job about exploring the minds of the people involved. Finally, these characters are people who you know in your life, and they are not treated with kid gloves; everything is presented straightforward, with nothing to hide.If you are looking for a plot, I can say that there is a very skimpy one. However, like a good story, it bonds you to all the characters, and in the end, you will be jolted. Along with ""Unforgiven"", this is his masterpiece. Hillary Swank is making her way to be the next great actress since Meryl Streep. Clint Eastwood courageously shows more emotion and range than he ever has on film. And Morgan Freeman, who is usually portrayed as a low talking father figure, adds a good foundation to the film as a whole. Direction is tight, and the score, while simple, is very moving. Forget the big budget blockbusters and give this small film a watch; by far one of the best American films to come out in a while.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
MDB deserved best picture,"I am not the biggest fan of Clint Eastwood's earlier work but with MDB, Mystic River, and Unforgiven, I have gained a new respect for him. MDB is story of a young woman (Hilary Swank) who wants to realize her dream of becoming a boxer. The best part about this movie is that it starts out like Rocky but ends up being one of the best films that I have ever seen. Anyone who calls this movie overreacted is a special kind of moron. MDB blew away the competition for best picture with its tremendous performances, great plot, and powerful surprise ending. I remember thinking that there was no way this movie was as good as Roger Ebert said it was. Well I can happily say that Ebert was right and I'm going a step farther by saying this is one of the best films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Sad, Sad,Sad","Not what you will expect. All of the characters' lives in this movie are so sad. Great performances by the actors. You can tell that the leading actress (Hillary Swank) worked hard to prepare for this movie. Morgan Freeman narrates the movie and he just has this voice that just captures every the very essence that is intended. I would not run out and buy this movie personally, renting it once will suffice, yet it is a good flick to watch at least once. Some movies are just to close to real life, in the sense that there is no fairy tale ending. It is too grim for me to sit through again. Oh, and I cannot forget mentioning Clint Eastwood, who is of course one of the most seasoned power actors of all time. In this movie he tries to keep a hard exterior, yet the whole time we can easily see his pain. Very real, very sad.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Hillary Swank does it again!,"Hillary Swank never fails to surprise me in a movie. Her only fault as an actress is having been associated with ""Bevery Hills 90210"" because her acting talents are superb and not worthy of a mindless teenage series.Clint Eastwood shines as her boxing manager as he is slowly transformed from a battle hardened trainer to a caring and loving individual. I think the chemistry between the two actors is on the money.Morgan Freeman acting goes without saying since he can take on any role and give it life and character. I love his narrative skills from the days of ""Shawshank Redemption"".This movie is great but you must be prepared for an emotional roller-coaster ride. It will tug at your heartstrings. The ending reveals Eastwood's true character.",,Anonymous,Drama
Oh Baby what a film!,"""Million Dollar Baby"" is a film about fighting, both physical and otherwise, that traces the story of three diverse yet connected characters. Eastwood, who also directs, stars as Frankie, an aged boxing trainer and gym owner. Morgan Freeman, who narrates the film, plays his right hand man and friend, Scrap. And Hilary Swank joins in as Maggie, a young lady eager to learn the sport. Expectedly the story follows Maggie's boxing journey, and perhaps more importantly, Frankie's relationships with Scrap, Maggie, and an unseen daughter, as they each deal with the powerful themes of loyalty, forgiveness, and love.Watching ""Million Dollar Baby"" is ridiculously enjoyable for a drama, the cinematic equivalent of cruising the spectacular Pacific Coast Highway with the wind whipping through your hair. The pace is steady and deliberate, like much of Eastwood's directorial work, but far from slow. And the scenery...oh, the scenery. Eastwood and Freeman, in roles similar to the screen image that each has cultivated over the years, are simply magnificent. How many actors can enrapture an audience with a discussion of socks? Or bleach? With their commanding presences, easy dialogue, and evident listening capacities, the pair presents a clinic in portraying old friends. Impressively, Swank fits right in with the two veterans. Sporting an impish smile and dogged determination, she expresses a proud humility that remains strong while reflecting her character's rough background. The ability to see great actors working brilliantly with great material is why many people go to the movies, and all three stars are worth the price of admission to observe, fully worthy of their Oscar nominations, as their interactions result in a picture that remains fully engaging without zooming from scene to scene.The beautiful simplicity of everything is captivating as well. Much like last year's ""Mystic River"", Eastwood's ever steady hand guides the entire picture. The cinematography of Tom Stern (""River"") is striking but not overwhelming, framing images perfectly and using slow movements to enhance the drama. His muted color scheme of blues, grays, and greens creates and matches the mood, and makes the occasional flashes of color all the more vibrant.Also like ""River"", ""Baby"" is accompanied by Eastwood's own simple yet elegant theme, on both classical guitar and piano, which accentuates the powerful emotion of the film. Baby lacks the palpable emotion of River, replacing it instead with drama that bubbles beneath the veneer of the boxing theme, and springs to life during the quiet in-between scenes that make the film great. On the sports movie spectrum, ""Baby"" sits somewhere between the pure sporting nature of ""Rocky"" and the sports-tinged drama of ""Raging Bull"". The boxing storyline is not unfamiliar, but the high technical value makes it seem fresh and original.Just when the course of the story seems apparent, in the final half hour the road of ""Baby"" takes a dramatic hairpin turn, as the tone is drastically altered, nearly sending the audience into the ditch. The change throws the car out of alignment and disrupts the ride, but once things settle down, one can look back and see how brave a cinematic decision was made in choosing such a path. The end result is a a different course that culminates in a major moral dilemma, one that the film answers without preaching or diving into the issues of such a decision. In fact, ""Baby"" doesn't even pretend to solve the problem, merely presenting the chosen option. Aside from that potential moral controversy, the only problem with the film is the precarious portrayal of the church, which is questionable at best and sacrilegious at worst, although the referenced flaws certainly do exist in the real world.Freeman's narration alone merits a recommendation for ""Million Dollar Baby"". But add the astonishing performances both in front of and behind the camera, and the aggregate is one of the best dramas in recent years, strong enough to present an extraneous story arc as touching instead of superfluous.Bottom Line: This is quite possibly the best film of 2004. 9 of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"A film that doesn't give in to the rules of the genre, and stays loyal to the story and the characters instead","Unfortunately, it seems as if two-time Academy Award winner Hilary Swank is one of the least famous actresses who managed to win the prestigious Oscar trophy twice during the course of the years. I say so in great sorrow, as I believe Swank is part of an elite list of modern-day actresses who truly lives up to the definition of acting. And boy can she act! Swank has that special ability to absorb herself into the role she's playing. If she's the androgynous victim in Boys Don't Cry, the nerdy cashier in the overlooked 11:14 or the powerful underdog boxer in this case  she'll always become the character and deliver a powerhouse, emotional draining, performance.Anyway Million Dollar Baby, Clint Eastwood's little boxer film that could, became a surprise Academy Award best picture winner back in 2005, beating Scorsese's wonderful The Aviator. The plot itself, much like the film and its lead actress, tells the story of Maggie Fitzgerald, a female boxer (Swank) who rises from her trailer-park life and become a professional fighter against the odds, with the help of her devoted manager, Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) a washed-up trainer who has seen much better days. However, this isn't your average boxing film. Unlike Rocky, Cinderella Man and others of the genre, its final twist is truly unpredictable, and will most likely leave you pondering for days after watching the film. Either way, I found it different in the right kind of fashion. It's a film that doesn't give in to the rules of the genre, and stays loyal to the story and the characters instead. Since it did that and still managed to gross over 100 million dollars in the North American box office alone, I would call it a remarkable achievement for the human spirit.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Profound & Unforgettable,"My husband and I see a lot of movies and usually spend the drive home talking about what we thought. That's about all the discussion or thought we give to most of the movies we see. Not the case with Million Dollar Baby. I've had a hard time getting this one off of my mind. I went to sleep thinking about it, woke up thinking about it, and have recalled its emotions many times today.I knew the movie was about an upcoming woman boxer and in fact it started out like an underdog ""Rocky""-type flick. Character development was perfection - you learned enough of the background to understand why each character became the person they were, but much was left unrevealed- some of which I'm still wondering about today.The deep emotions of joy, triumph, & overcoming your past were balanced with enough sadness to be moved to tears. And questions were raised that are truly NOT black and white, regardless of your religious or ethical beliefs.This movie left me sadder than most movies I've ever seen. I was moved in a way few movies have impacted me.It's not a ""feel good"" movie, but it is a movie that will make you feel. Go and experience Million Dollar Baby. Go on a day you can handle some pain and sadness. It is worth your time & tears and you will be rewarded with outstanding performances from an amazing cast.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
M$B is a Must See Movie,"After seeing M$B I can say this is more than just a boxing movie.

Thats where she meets Frank played by Clint Eastwood who owns a boxing gym. She also meets Frank's longtime friend/partner ""Scrap"" played by respected actor Morgan Freeman who works at the gym. In one of the more touching moments in the film, Maggie offers to walk Scrap home at closing time, Scrap stops and turns his head to tell Maggie he is home as he lives at the gym in a room not much bigger than a closet.

A sour lesson,"Million Dollar Baby"" is Clint's 27th film at progress in directing. His turnover from that legendary course of bravery in ""Unforgiven"", is now set up in the flat; not charming arena of boxing. But did Clint Eastwood make a movie about boxing? Yes, no. Boxing is the element of desire; uniquely secondary for the movie but primordial to the character of Maggie, to improve on conditions. The lesson moves in a dimmed world, where characters are incomplete and they found in another the way to complete themselves. Eastwood shows his capacity to create credible characters; no dimensional yet dorky and cartoonish heroes. The heroes in ""Million Dollar Baby"" are those we seem to know; but not entirely. The lesson is ""Nothing is beyond you"", yet I find amazing how a very fine script can adjust a story of Frankie's redemption and anger by a lack of communication with his daughter. The film is a calm spectacle of everyday heroes, of great performances (Morgan Freeman with age absorbs perfection) yet a very sour taste. The ending is emotional, but can unbalance the fictional precision that was carried away. Indeed for that, another Academy Award and public award winner.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

"You don't have a video library if you don't own this one, and you haven't been to the movies if you haven't seen it.","Where do I begin? OK, how about this. Clint Eastwood. Morgan Freeman. Hillary Swank. Read that list again. Repeat it aloud like you were learning a list of holy sacraments for catechism. These aren't actors. These are national treasures. Consider yourself lucky to be able to see any one of them in a movie. To have a movie with the three of them in starring roles, that's not luck, that's manna from heaven. Eastwood, Freeman. These are stars well established in the firmament, and either could elevate even the most prosaic of films into something magical. But this is no prosaic film. It's magic is overwhelming.But take note. A new star shines throughout this movie, even in the brilliant light of the infallible Eastwood and Freeman, and I am at a loss to begin to describe her magnificence. Radiant. Beautiful. Brilliant. Let me know when you get the idea, so I can go on. Hillary is stunning, breathtaking. Her subtle and nuanced performance is beyond description. She's a white trash would be fighter, too old to train and it doesn't matter anyway 'cause Eastwood ""don't train girls.""

And suddenly, she's a contender.And just when we thought this was going to be another Schlocky Rocky ain't it touching 'cause the underdog wins piece of crap movie, we are reminded oh so powerfully that this is, after all, a Clint Eastwood movie.

I thought it was just going to be about boxing in the sense of young girl goes to train with veteran boxing trainer and becomes world champion...the end. But it was so much more than that. As others have commented before, the film explores life itself through the characters and the boxing ring. The acting is superb with Clint Eastwood playing a bitter boxing trainer with a history involving something he regrets. Morgan Freeman narrates superbly just as he did in Shawshank Redemption, and as Eastwood's handyman does not take over the screen. Hilary Swank is outstanding as the girl from the trailer park, turned boxing hero. She plays the role superbly and you feel engaged towards her character.

Great film,"There's a line in Million Dollar Baby where Scrap (Morgan Freeman) tells Frankie (Clint Eastwood) that if Maggie (Hilary Swank) were to die today, she would die a happy person, because she made it. But he didn't have to say that. It was obvious. The pace of the story and the performances from all three actors tells this so well.Hilary Swank is amazing as a young woman who has nothing in this world but her own ambition and belief in her dream of becoming a boxer. ""She grew up knowing one thing. She was trash."" was what Scrap had said. Yes, it sounds recycled, like it's been tried before, but from the moment Swank walks on the screen, you believe it. She plays the part so honestly and without over indulgence in sensitivity and emotion. This may be because Eastwood's direction was to tell the story with simplicity and depth.Once again Eastwood delivers a great story on screen, and his performance as a gritty, old boxing trainer with scars of his own was outstanding. As well was Morgan Freeman's character who's loss was the Championship, and his eye under the direction of Frankie years earlier.To say that Million Dollar Baby is a heavy hearted film is putting it lightly. But it will stay with you for a few days. And at the end of it you realize just how much of a hero Maggie Fitzgerald is.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Another solid and gut-wrenching film from Eastwood,"It is an interesting phenomenon to me that some actors, regardless of their popularity, are much better directors than actors. Sidney Pollack and Ron Howard come to mind immediately, but I feel that the personification of this idea is Clint Eastwood, whose film ""Million Dollar Baby"" is absolutely wonderful.""Million Dollar Baby"" is the story of Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank), a waitress described as ""white trash"", who is in reality, everything her reputation is not. Born and raised in the deep south and raised in a family of lazy, horrible people, she turns up at the training gym of Frankie Dunn (Eastwood), begging him to train her for the women's boxing circuit. When he repeatedly says no, she continues to train furiously, until he relents and the two (plus Frankie's right hand man Eddie Dupris, played by Morgan Freeman) strike up a working relationship that quickly develops into a deep friendship. When Maggie is injured during the most important match of her life, their relationship reaches an even greater level, where they both have to make decisions that will affect the rest of their lives.I went into ""Million Dollar Baby"" with a couple of preconceptions, something that I try not to do. Luckily, they ended up working in favor of me enjoying the film. Firstly, of the Eastwood-directed films I have seen, (namely ""Play Misty for Me"", ""Unforgiven"" and ""Mystic River"", I acknowledged that they were good films. In the case of ""Unforgiven"" and ""Mystic River"", they were really good, if not great films. ""Million Dollar Baby"" falls squarely into that category as well. The film's story is compelling (and somewhat controversial, at least for some people) until its conclusion, a very refreshing thing to behold, particularly nowadays when twenty pages of script seem to constitute a feature length screenplay.Regarding the script, there was not a moment when I didn't buy what was being presented to me, and I think that this is partly thanks to the superior performances of the three primary actors. ""Performance"" isn't even a fair word to use in this case because there was never a moment where I felt that they were ""acting"". Despite the heavy dramatic themes, histrionics were not present. Hilary Swank is simply amazing, and shows that given the right material, she will take the role and make it hers alone; I cannot fathom anyone else doing her complicated role any kind of justice. Morgan Freeman  someone give this man an Oscar. I'm not entirely sure how many times you can be consistently excellent in a role before they are actually given public recognition for their talents, but once again, he pulls out a great supporting role as a variant of his ""Shawshank"" character, only with a lot more vinegar in him. The biggest surprise for me, however, was Clint Eastwood. As I mentioned earlier, one can appreciate someone for being an icon, but an iconic status does not make one a good actor. (See John Wayne, or more recently, J.Lo for other examples.) His performance in ""Million Dollar Baby"" however, was sublime. Frankie's character is a study in dynamics; he is curmudgeonly yet generous, fierce but tired. He attends church daily, but on some level questions his faith. Perhaps it was the role that he gave himself, but he was a perfect fit. Previously, I'd only seen Eastwood as a squinting, growling man in his roles; and frankly, he does the same thing in this role as well  but in this case it works wonderfully.As far as Eastwood's direction, it is once again dead-on. The film, despite its violent and emotional themes is very warm, with its lighting and cinematography. The pacing is also excellent. Once again, however, while I feel the film was very good, and I certainly wouldn't be staging my 342nd boycott if it won an Oscar, there was nothing about the film that excited me. The story and the performances grabbed me, but I didn't feel ""excited"" when I left, as I have with about a half dozen other films I've seen in the past year. I mentioned Ron Howard earlier in regard to acting, and I feel compelled to invoke his name again in this instance. His films are good, solid films. But (and not to personalize this too much) when, for example, I saw that ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""Moulin Rouge!"" were both up for Best Picture, I was disappointed when the former won because it was a ""safe"" choice. A good movie, but nothing dynamic about it. And that's how I feel about Eastwood's films; they are good films, I can't find a lot of things wrong with them, but in general they don't excite me.I still give ""Million Dollar Baby"" a 7/10, however because it is a very good film, and I think it is very deserving of its Oscar nomination and of the many accolades it has received, both from film critics and regular theatergoers like us alike.--Shelly",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Million Dollar Baby should not have won best picture award,"******SPOILERS************I just saw Million Dollar Baby for the first time. What I don't understand is why they had Frankie had to turn off the respirator. He said, ""I will turn off your air machine and you will go to sleep. I'll give you an injection and you will STAY asleep."" If this had been a real life situation, turning off the respirator would have sounded an alarm in the nurse's station and brought the nurses running in to re-connect it before Frankie could have administered the adrenalin to Maggie- and he would have been hauled off by the police. It was not necessary to turn off the respirator. Turning it off would only make her start gasping for breath in time, alert the nurses and make her death more painful. The adrenalin would have killed her by itself in a few minutes and he would have had time to escape. Surely they have medical advisers. How could they make such a mistake?I don't know much about boxing, but in real life, during a world championship bout, considering the obvious and deliberately illegal tactics used by Blue Bear during the first round, it have resulted in her disqualification. Also, Blue Bear's punch after the bell was so late and so violent it would have resulted in an immediate disqualification. Would the referee turn his back on the two fighters unless they were both in their respective corners? However, even if he didn't see the late (and ultimately fatal) punch, the officials and judges would have notified the referee. How could they declare Maggie the loser and BB the winner?What was with the priest? I'm not Catholic, but I don't think priests would drop the ""F bomb""- and be so rude and negative with Frankie. This was the only one in the movie and completely unrealistic and unnecessary.I enjoyed the movie.

"A Wonderful, and Important Film","As I sat through ""Million Dollar Baby"", I was very pleased about the quality of the film as a whole. Then, the film took a dark turn, and it became a multi-dimensional film, one that I will never forget. The acting, writing, directing, music, and even the lighting of the film was perfect for what it was. I happen to agree with the choices of the characters of the film. Does that make me biased?, I don't think so, because if you really think about it, nobody wins. It's about bonds that we make with people. An unspoken love that we have for the people that we connect with in life. Clint Eastwood is a master. He has proved that throughout his career. With ""Baby"", he not only shows us his mastery as a director, but a spot-on acting job as the grumpy gym owner. This IS his masterpiece. Morgan Freeman is wonderful, as always as Scraps. I can't imagine the film without his narration. The film, though, belongs to Hilary Swank. She is both mentally and physically perfect for Maggie. Swank makes you fall in love with Maggie, makes you cheer her on in the fight scenes. Swank brings that character to life. She is honest in every way in her acting.

But this did it with wit and sentiment that was never cheap or cheezy.Hilary Swank proved once again that she actually has acting chops and isn't just that chick who played that chick who thought she was a dude. This is the real deal. Morgan Freeman was solid as ever. But all praise to where it is due: Clint.Kudos on Clint's directing, his stirring score and his understated, but superb acting.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Clint Eastwood scores another home run directing this heartbreaking story about a determined woman boxer.,"Starring: Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman Boxing is a sport that I personally do not appreciate. Two guys go into the squared circle, put on some gloves, and beat the living crap out of each other. To me, that isn't entertainment. That's just stupidity.If nothing else though, I admire the people who go through that rigorous training and have the physical skill and strength to be such incredible fighters.Million Dollar Baby is a movie all about boxing. Frankie (Eastwood) is an over the hill boxing trainer and manager who owns a gym. His prize fighter is on the verge of being ready for a title match, but Frankie holds him back for a few more fights so that he's ready. His fighter doesn't want to wait and finds a new manager.From the beginning of the movie, there is a woman frequently showing up at the gym to train. Her name is Maggie (Swank), a southerner from a poor background with dreams and a truckload of ambition. She wants Frankie to be here manager, but Frankie doesn't train girls. No matter how hard Maggie tries to convince him, Frankie doesn't budge.Eventually, after his fighter leaves him, Frankie has a change of heart and decided to take Maggie on. They form a friendship that almost seems like a father/daughter relationship. Frankie looks out for Maggie all the time, doing his best to protect her, guide her, train her, and send her forward into the boxing world. Maggie advances and eventually gets a title bout. But tragedy strikes. Specifically, I will not say what, but Maggie's boxing career comes to an abrupt and tragic end.The rest of the movie is very difficult to watch because you feel genuinely sorry for Maggie when you see her lying in that hospital bed. At points in the movie I felt my eyes getting a little moist.Million Dollar Baby is a very well done movie. The acting is superb, the plot is great, the movie is mostly clean. But the ending is far too tragic for my taste. I watch movies to be entertained. Not depressed.This movie is very good in a The Green Mile or Forrest Gump kind of way.Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (definitely worth a look)",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
The Noble Art of Self Defense,"Clint Eastwood claims that he learned to direct when he starred in Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns in the 60's. And you have to look quite hard to find a better teacher.Something Eastwood demonstrates in ""Million Dollar Baby"". The film is part of a long tradition of boxing movies that Hollywood has always been fascinated by. Just think of classics like ""Rocky"" or ""Raging Bull"".But this time the story centers around a young, female fighter. It reveals a lot about Clint Eastwood's talent as a director that Hillary Swank manages to create such a convincing portrait in the leading role.So, this is a good watch even for those who don't happen to be interested in the ""noble art of self-defense"".",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Eastwood hits the nail on the head again,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsHard-faced,hard-bitten boxing trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) is a man battling his own inner-demons and is not at a time in his life where he wants to go against the routine that he has settled into.So when trailer-trash waitress Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) wonders into his gym one day,eager to become a female boxer (which Frank has never trained before!) he is understandably disconcerted.However,with some gentle persuasion from his only true friend and former boxing champion Eddie 'Scrap-Iron' Dupris (Morgan Freeman) and Maggie's consistent determination,he gradually becomes less stuck-in-his-ways and heralds Maggie to championship level,and to the triumpths and tragedies that follow...As is noted in the trivia section,this is no less than Clint's 25th film as director,his 57th film as an actor and his 21st film as a producer.There can be no question that this is a man truly deserving of his lifetime achievement award.It is truly remarkable that,even at the age of 74,Clint's name can still garner a cinema release (even a limited one,as in the case of films like Blood Work and True Crime) as opposed to having slipped into a life of DTV mediocrity.Yet it is also his style that keeps his films distinguished and apart from any other films of this day.In other words,you know an Eastwood film when you see one.This,like a fair few of his previous efforts,is a mature,slow,considerate film that the 2-Fast-2-Furious generation are unlikely to have the patience and attention span to sit through.As a previous reviewer noted,Clint refuses to 'dumb-his-films-down' and cut corners in any way...While you have to admire his longitivity,the fact remains that Eastwood has never been a great emotional actor.There's a scene near the end where he appears to be trying to cry that comes off as terribly unconvincing.Yet he's as great as the grizzled,hard-faced tough guy act as he's ever been,and,even at 74,there were certain scenes where his physical appearance really scared me and made me think I still wouldn't want to mess with him in real life.I suppose the same could be said of his co-star Freeman,but,like Eastwood,he does his thing and provides an engaging narrative voice-over throughout the film.Yet the real star of the show and the deserved Oscar winner is Swank,very good as the feisty,determined,give-it-all-she's-got-girl knowing she can't fail or else succumb to a life of further mediocrity.What will further distance the film from a large proportion of the modern day audience is it's heavy,hard-hitting (forgive the pun!) scenes.It's got a 12A certificate,yet it's doubtful a lot of people that age will have the maturity,or,ridiculous as it seems,even mental responsibility to handle it.It's a gentle,easy-flowing film that shows Eastwood's maturity as a film-maker and star and,in this day and age,is distinctly,discernably Eastwood.*****",,Anonymous,Drama
Cannot Leave You Untouched,"I really consider Clint Eastwood as one of the most charismatic persons of the film industry. While starting up with macho roles in movies like ""Dirty Hurry"" and ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"", he completely changed course later on and started doing very sophisticated, and even art, films, such as ""Mystic River"" and ""Bird"".""Million Dollar Baby"" is a prime example of Clint Eastwood's genius. The story is about Maggie (Swank), a female boxer, who has nothing else in her life than her boxing talent. Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) is a tired, old coach, whom she approaches and he grudgingly decides to take her after Eddie ""Scrup-Iron"" (Freeman), his assistant and pal, persuades him to. The girl proves to be a very promising athlete, and she climbs the ladder of success very swiftly. Frankie starts to feel very close with her, as she reminds him of his long-gone daughter. Things however get very nasty when Maggie suffers from a serious accident, and everything now gets turned upside down...All the Oscars in this film (nominations and winnings), are well deserved: Eastwood provides us with an A-class direction, as he portrays us a dark world of losers where boxing is their only way for them to feel they have a purpose in life. The leading trio (Eastwood, Swank, Freeman) are so superb in their roles, that it is almost impossible for me to distinguish among them. All in all, the film describes a sad story, very well told, which cannot leave you untouched.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Wonderfully Brilliant Surprising Masterpiece,"To be honest, when I first heard about this movie and that it was Mr. Eastwood's next film venture, I was a bit skeptical. Even though I am a die-hard Clint Eastwood fan, even giving my son the middle name Eastwood, it sounded like a boring story and not up my idol's alley. Then of course, after watching the trailer, I became intrigued and then of course, after all the critical praise, became intent on seeing it soon. Trouble was, it was only playing at one theater in my area and a good thirty miles from home. Tonight, I decided to make the trip and boy my efforts paid off. This film starts out to be a great story and sweet, funny and visually stunning and then once it starts to reach it's climax, changes gears and goes another direction. I won't tell you where it heads, but suffice it say, this film was just marvelous. Also, be prepared, that if some films tug at your heart strings, it may be worthwhile to take some tissues with you. Just do whatever you can to see this movie, you'll be glad you did. Bravo Clint, All The Very Best And Many Years To Come.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Great movie!,"If any movie deserved an Oscar for sure then this movie is it. Million Dollar Baby is without any doubt the best American movie of the year. It seems to be a little biographic but it's not. It's a very emotional movie that goes in the exactly right pace to land the ""big punch"" in the end.Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman are giving an absolutely wonderful performance, especially Hilary Swank. She looks like the role of Maggie Fitzgerald was made for her, a little like she doesn't even need to act. Clint Esatwood plays very well the tough (well, more then tough since ""tough ain't enough) trainer in all situations, although there was something that bothered me about him but I wouldn't be able to name it. Morgan Freeman is actually playing quite a small role even 'though he is in many scenes. I can't say much about his performance because it looks like quite an easy role but I can say at least that he looked absolutely natural.The fighting scenes were all from weak to great but you don't remember the weak ones anyway because they last for few seconds only. They are there only to be passed so who really cares that boxing doesn't really looks this way. I don't think this movie is even about boxing after all, it's absolutely nothing like the famous boxing movies. It's a totally different story and I'm not willing to share any of it with those who didn't see it because one of the things I enjoyed the most was not knowing even a small bit of the story while watching. This way I enjoyed it completely. It's like this movie got pure joy and pure sadness in it (damn, I hope it's not a spoiler). All of course is thanks to a great directing by Clint Eastwood.So for conclusion, I think it's a must see for everyone. There is absolutely no chance that you won't enjoy it.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Wonderful Masterwork from Eastwood,"Clint Eastwood knows how to craft a story with human relationships and emotion as the framework. This is a beautiful piece of acting, screen writing, cinematography, and directing. It is tragic but always uplifting. I loved every minute of ""Million Dollar Baby"". Hilary Swank gives a strong, very human performance. She is able to carry the weight of her back story in her shoulders and is able to communicate triumph with her face alone. Clint Eastwood does give the performance of his career as the aged trainer of Swank's character. I found Morgan Freeman's ""Scrap"" is the best supporting character he has done since ""Shawshank Redemption"". Wonderful, subtle, unobtrusive screen writing lets the character's stories develop at a slower, more human, very touching way. The best film of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Wow!,"I give this 9 stars out of 10.I usually do not give most movies anything above 7 because they just do not deserve it. Movies that are 8, 9, 10 have two things in common: great story and great performance. Every year, only a handful of movies, if at that, I believe deserve a score of 8 or above. The reason why I am discussing this is because I have friends who will be receiving their Academy ballots for the upcoming Oscar Awards and I hope some of them will give their vote to this movie.This movie is simply superb! Well written and very good performance. I cannot single out one person as standing out over others in this movie. Perhaps it is because you have three really good actors and actress who perform their craft so well that it seems effortless when you see them on the screen.The story! I mean, when I first heard the premise of this movie, I was simply turned off by it and did not watch it when it first came out in theaters. Big mistake. The saying, you cannot judge a book by its cover, is so true here.The movie is about a young woman (Hilary Swank) from a poverty background whose dream is to become a female boxer. She wants to train under a veteran trainer (Clint Eastwood) but he does not want to train her at first. The boxing gym's janitor (Morgan Freeman) gives her boxing advice so that she can train properly. Eventually, her perseverance wins out and the veteran trainer takes her under his tutelage. Things go well until tragedy strikes which causes the characters to evaluate what is truly important in their life.If this was simply a boxing story, I would give it no more than 6 stars. Thankfully it is not. Kudos to Rope Burns, F.X. Toole, and Paul Haggis, in bringing this story into creation. Further Kudos for director Clint Eastwood...the man is simply a juggernaut of talent.Seeing movies like this really makes all those other bad movies that I had watched throughout the year, bearable.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

And is a blueprint on how to make a great movie. Unlike the Aviator that did everything wrong! Clint is, at worst, excellent in his characters reluctance to train a female boxer, and Hilary Swank is just as charming on her characters hardheadedness and determination. And the chemistry between these 2 actors are incredible when he finally decides to coach and train her, and is maintained all the way to the end.

Cauliflowered,"I've been watching films deeply enough to develop a strategy of trust. There are certain persons that if they are involved in a film, I'll go into it with an open soul. Often they'll fail but thats a small cost in an otherwise rewarding life of trust. There are only a few actors on this list, some writers of course and directors.And there's another list of people to avoid, people who have damaged my soul and compromised my world, folks who require you to repair your encounter with them. I avoided this project until now because it has both types. Swank is an earnest actor not on either list.Eastwood is someone who has earned my trust because of one amazing project, ""Mystic River."" Quite apart from the story, it is about direction, a melding of forces. All the major actors in the thing are actors who also direct. All of them understand to a significant degree what most actors don't, that a performance has both inside and outside compositional values. What Eastwood wrangled in that little film was an encounter not only among characters as scripted, and among acting philosophies as often happens, but also among actors situation in what they see as the directorial situation the local composition. And we also have the interaction of all layers with the others. Marvelous, and worthy of trust.Plus the man is so economical. Economy by itself isn't worth much; Bresson chafes me. But Eastwood can focus and pare so that even the most ordinary effect can seem purposeful. And that's what happens here. This is such an ordinary, derivative, spitefully mundane and worthless script, it says something that he has given it dignity. But that's all it is, tripe with a clean wrapper.The two men on my list that do not deserve a place in my pantheon of film friends: Freeman and Haggis.Haggis is a hack, a machine, a cut and paste expert in appealing to the lowest and most uncomplicated sentimentalites. That's allowable in my book so long as there's some novelty, some new handle on life some new angle, something that pulls us up with tools for seeing. Never.Freeman is simply an annoyance. He's an arrogant actor exploiting black avuncular type. He decided long ago and has often said that he will just be himself, regardless of what the role requires. But that never comes up because he only chooses roles that match what he has chosen to invent himself as a person. Its a fake racist nobility, made ever so more offensive with the fake wisdom that accompanies it.I'll take a hundred Eddie Murphys exploring the limits of race over one who safely cashes in on it. Listen to his narrative phrasing in the voiceovers. Eastwood should have known better.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",,Anonymous,Drama
Superb drama about a dream that results in a nightmare,"NO SPOILERS. Million Dollar Baby stands for teaching us the meaning of ""the dream come true"" motto that everyone tries to achieve during life. A woman that came from an unknown poor town seeks a dream in a sleazy box gymnasium and hopes to be trained by a well-reputed elderly man that once was called the best stitch man outside the ring. The movie is packed with human drama and a bit of comedy moments with one Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood at their best. Although this movie is about boxing, the main attention and script runs far beyond this subject, taking us to a journey into the world of this violent sport as well to an emotional aura, lots of drama, human behavior, courage, determination and doggedness.This film deserved all the Oscars nominated to it and I would advise you as a must to see... and don't get panicked if at the end of it a pair of oversuspicious tears come out of your eyes... it's pure drama at its best.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Not a review as such.,"To not see this movie based on any comments on this or any other site would be a terrible shame, an opportunity to watch what I consider to be the best movie of the year lost. While not in any way a ""female Rocky"" (who'd wanna see that anyway?, and not a feel good popcorn flick, it's beautifully written, cleverly but simply directed and acted with true passion. To be a good boxing movie is tough, no sport has had more movies made about it, yet Million Dollar Baby succeeds with aplomb. Hilary Swanks portrayal of Maggie is full of joy and love for life, despite hardship, and this contrasts nicely with Eastwoods Frankie, yet ultimately he seems to find some joy in his relationship with Maggie. While not likely to make you smile all the way through, if you don't find yourself smiling a few hours after you leave, you may not have really understood the film, which is ultimately about what all good movies are about, the indomitability of the human spirit, despite the ending. A film about people far, far more than about boxing, this is what makes it so worthy of acknowledgement by the Academy, and by yourselves. Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Tough Ain't Enough,"Maggie Fitzgerald, a poor thirty-one year old waitress from the very lower classes and with a dysfunctional loser family, decides to make a difference through boxing.

Frankie has a problematical relationship with his daughter, and practically adopts Maggie along her career.Overall, this is one of the best films ever.

Girls don't fight,"I recently read the late F.X. Toole's only novel, 'Pound for Pound'; but watch 'Million Dollar Baby', derived from an earlier short story of Toole's, and you enter exactly the same world, that of seedy gyms occupied by old men for whom life is boxing, and boxing is life. The twist in this tale is that the central boxer is a woman; although the meaning of title eventually becomes apparent in a way you don't at first suspect. However, I found the film a little short on back story, the lead male characters (played by director Clint Eastwood, and fellow veteran Morgan Freeman) seem weary without explanation; sighing, which both are good at, is not in itself a sign of profundity. And rather as it did in 'The Shawshank Redemption', Morgan's narration softens the movie, which in fact is surprisingly unvisceral for a story about fighting. Likewise, the issue of how a woman finds social acceptance as a boxer is skirted; Hilary Swank's character feels more at home here than she does anywhere else, although we learn nothing of how she came to discover that boxing was her thing. Of course, in many ways, this film is better for not being 'Rocky'; but I still wonder, did it have to be quite so low-key?",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Against All Odds...,"It took me awhile to get into ""Million Dollar Baby."" Like all of Eastwood's latter day helmed films, it's snail-paced, darkly lit to the point of annoyance, and at times deafeningly quiet. I thought I had paid to see an underdog triumphs story, a rote boxing pic about an old dog of a trainer (Eastwood) reluctantly teaching a down-and-out youngster (Hillary Swank-amazing here and finally delivering on the promise of her breakthrough performance in ""Boys Don't Cry""). The intimate details of boxing and using the sport as life metaphor are done well here, but nothing special.Then, about three quarters of the way through the film, it takes a turn I was not aware it would take, and I was blindsided, and then treated to a bearing of Eastwood's soul as an actor and a director, as a man and an artist...an honest and unflinching tribute to the life and philosophies of the noble outsider, the person living by their own set of morals and values, the person who does what is right even when it flies in the face of standard practices and laws. In the shadows of the tragedy that the last quarter of the film depicts, we get treated to Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Swank bearing all, and giving heartbreaking and devastating performances that haunted me long afterwords. Say what you will about Eastwood as a director (he's usually overrated) and as an actor (he usually plays himself), but he gives us a blazing look here into his perspective of the world, and it is both tragic and beautiful to watch in ""Million Dollar Baby.""",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
How to rescue a plain script,"OK, I'll admit it right away: I think boxing is a most barbaric activity. And anyone who enjoys it ought to get their head examined. Or punched at, just so they can ponder whether it's really a ""sport"".As a result, the environment in which the action was set left me cold, if not upset. Still, I had decided to see that movie, out of curiosity  after all, it had won awards. The camera and lighting work was flawless and very creative. Hilary Swank does deliver an endearing image. Yet the whole story reeks of ""déjà vu"". The action is linear, usually predictable, and clichés about the tough guys mumbling in a barely understandable tone are, frankly, quite worn out.Considering I had seen Ingmar Bergman's magnificent Saraband a few days earlier, I experienced quite a sobering evening with Million Dollar Baby.Another case of Hollywood trying to act intellectual.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
A movie to enjoy on many levels,"There is not much more I can add to the praise already posted about Million Dollar Baby. The acting, direction, lighting, cinematography, script, etc. were outstanding -- particularly Hilary Swank. Not a perfect film -- but very nearly. The best movie I've seen in several years.What amazes me is the reactions of those who hate the film...primarily because of the last third of it. Others have pointed out that this probably stems from the naysayers objection to being asked to really feel and think during a film that they anticipated as another Rocky. Eastwood didn't suddenly change directions -- the last third of the film is the point of his film. He didn't betray his audience -- everything before that final 35 minutes or so was the foundation for that ending.A movie that challenges us to examine our beliefs and preconceptions is a rarity these days -- at least in the US industry. By not supplying a lot of details about his characters, he was respecting his audience's ability to use little hints and nuances to grasp their backgrounds.Again, this is a wonderful film.",,Anonymous,Drama
One of the best films in the past decade ... and the decade before that ...,"Forget your personal taste for a particular type of film. Forget about all the films you thought was great in the past few years. Clint Eastwood, at his age as a master director now, shows what the simplicity of storytelling can be without all the bells-and-whistles of today's films, filled with all sorts of boring twists and uninteresting characters.Million Dollar Baby is the newest blueprint to simple, cinematic storytelling done at it's best.Paul Haggis' script should be the newest example of ""How to write great stories for the big screen?"" It should be issued in film schools across the world, showing these wannabes how it is done. It should be used as a source of inspiration for studio execs looking for that next project that would help them keep their jobs. He told enough on the character's journeys without giving us too much information. He never tried to spoon feed us with the answers to all of our questions by explaining. I'm glad we never knew what exactly was the problem between Frankie (Clint Eastwood) and his daughter. Haggis forces the viewers to take as much as we needed to join in on this extraordinary journey. He had shown us how to use narration without using narration.Clint Eastwood's directing was superb. He was able to capture crucial and emotional moments that didn't lessen the quality of the writing. He was able to help his cast deliver excellent performances depicting simple characters that seem to be ""the unwanted."" He also didn't take away from the cinematic experience with fancy camera angles and MTV style editing. He would have a master shot that can hold on a moment as long as possible, and with the help of the great performances, the beautifully choreographed masters work without boring us. He didn't drown out the moments with predictable, cliché music scoring as well, contributing to the beautiful music that expressed the power of this simple story without feeling out of place.Hillary Swank's best performance ever. I enjoyed her more in this movie than the last film she had done that won her her first Oscar. She was empathetic without being sympathetic. She was real. Her ability to be tough and sometimes ruthless, merciless, was seen in her boxing matches with opponents. Maggie's love never felt false.Morgan Freeman's well deserved Oscar performance. It's about time. He was subtle and realistic. He didn't try to provoke anything from anyone, especially the audience. Scrap was one of those characters that believed in the best in all of us and was humbled enough by his own life experiences to help us find that potential in ourselves, encouraging us to use it as a survival tool. He only added to this ensemble cast.And, in my humble opinion, this is Clint Eastwood's best performance ever, which is hard to say looking back on his long career.I don't want to give away too much of the film. I advise all filmmakers and audiences alike to go and experience the best film of 2004, Million Dollar Baby. This is what film story telling is all about. 10/10 - A+",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Drags a bit, but decent character study","Another sports movie. In fact, a boxing movie. A boxing movie with Hillary Swank, Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman. It's more of a drama, I feel, but it's still a sports movie, but a more individualistic one. Like boxing movies before it, it still has the training scenes, the fight scenes, etc. There is a quiet buildup as the characters reveal more and more about themselves. The movie isn't too sledgehammer, but at times it does put more in your face than it needs to. Like Morgan Freeman's running commentary track. Voice-over narration really isn't necessary for this movie and I think that it took away, rather than added to the film.There is a whole subplot involving a priest and Clint Eastwood's character's faith (or lack thereof). If it had been ejected from the film, it would've only served to make the film tighter. It doesn't really complexify Frankie, nor does it substantially add to the film. Clint is a mostly talented actor and director (don't watch Blood Work, it's not very good). The cast does a good enough job.The ending of the film (or, the falling action), dragged on a little too long and Eastwood is known for slightly languid pacing. He doesn't manage to pace any better here, but still, in the end, the film was probably the best of the airplane fare that I saw and I enjoyed it enough that I kept watching even though I was feeling quite sick. It could've been even better if the editing and direction were a little less kitchen-sink and plain, but not a bad movie. Not a happy one either, so don't watch it if you want to feel good. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Freeman, Eastwood, and Swank Shine Eternal","Freeman, Eastwood, and Swank create legendary performances while creating a legend - fictitious, yes, but the heart shines through.This film is by any measure controversial. I won't include spoilers for two reasons: 1) to induce those who haven't seen this elegiac masterpiece, and 2) to let those new to the film experience the grace of humanity, and the proximity of G*d - divinity - the great beyond.Eastwood runs a failing gym, out of heart, out of hope for his last prize fighter who has a valid chance at a title - something that Eastwood never obtained in his long career as a brilliant manager cum cut-man.The gym is replete with lost souls, those who had a chance, those that delude a title shot, and those with hearts to small to fight for glory despite innate talent.Swank enters the gym, tips from her waitressing job buy her time in the gym, and she has a dream of becoming the top pugilist in her division. She scraps steak from her job, she admits her heritage of growing up ""white trash"" - she speaks of the defeat that overcame her family - but her heart swells, and in every step, or elusive blow to the hanging bag - her heart beats victory.Eastwood becomes her reluctant trainer and delegable father - his own daughter not being on speaking terms - why, the audience is never informed - but Eastwood clings that each letter he sends won't be returned from his daughter like the hundred others that he keeps as punishment.One would guess that Eastwood sins were great - that he betrayed his daughter - that he left his wife, that he is looking through redemption through the victory of his protégés.In a word, this film chronicles Swank's rise from ""trailor trash"" to the fierce warrior who destroys her competition to the cheers, and inspired crowds chanting her Gaelic name, given to her by the poetry reading Eastwood.Swank has her chance, and victory is certain. Eastwood has borough a fighter to the height of heart and skill. But this is not a glorified female version of Rocky, or more recently Cinderalla man. It is a story of friendship, loyalty, and again, like Mystic River, like Unforgiven, the tragic hand of G*d intervening to force the characters to face themselves at the level of heart, of Philos, of the knowledge of one's limits of love and devotion.These themes prevail Eastwood's recent films, and his touch is delicate, and subcutaneous. To insert a personal anecdote - I sat in the theater long after the final frames had run, and the theater became lit, and emptied. Stunned that wisdom could be brought to the screen like the best of literature, floating like the best of Chopin's Nocturne's. This is a film for the ages. And will be talked about, and written about and discussed, for years to come.The best film of the year, from one of Hollywood's most understated, and underrated directors - the masterfully wise Mr. Eastwood.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
I was never bored...,"If you are a fan of the movies, and you probably are since you have come to IMDb and are reading movie reviews, then you will probably not be bored during Million Dollar Baby. The story and the characters are interesting enough to keep your attention and I didn't have any issues with the pace of the movie, but this was a fairly average movie. What was well done? The performances by Clint Eastwood, Hillary Swank and Morgan Freeman were superior and easily the best part of the film. I'm not entirely sure why Morgan Freeman decided to rasp his already deep voice for the film as it was unnecessary. Lighting was used very effectively throughout enhancing the dark nature of the film. Other than those facets, I had a few problems with the movie.Perhaps I would not be so disappointed had this film not won the award for best picture. I don't understand the fascination with Clint Eastwood in Hollywood. He is an excellent actor, but his directorial skills are pretty average. He doesn't do anything particularly unique to enhance a movie or tell the story in a different way.It seems to me that he also missed an opportunity in the movie. Since the story centers on loneliness and love and opportunity, he could have used silence effectively. That being said, the entire narration of the movie could be eliminated in favor of silence and the movie may have been a little more powerful. There were also several unrealistic points in the movie, such as certain occurrences in the boxing matches and in his conversations with the priest that just wouldn't happen in normal situations.This movie was okay. It wasn't great and it wasn't horrible - definitely not best picture worthy.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
What a disaster!,"One of the biggest disappointments this year. After all the buzz and 5 Oscars I expected some really huge impact on me & a very strong story. Well, right from the beginning I was asking myself ""Oh my, this is REALLY the best movie of the year???""... Maybe I'm dull, but I cannot see anything new in the film, on the contrary. God, we've seen so many scenes so similar to this, that I couldn't believe that ""such a director"" as Clint Eastwood directed it! Why did Hilary win the prize? She did nothing, again, but some boxing, speaking with Southern-American accent and lying in bed!!! Is this worth an Oscar? You know, I'm quite convinced that if it hadn't been for Eastwood sitting on the director's chair, all the critics would have been very negative and no-one would have appreciated this film. For me it's nothing but cliché plot and dialogs seen thousand times before, with no profound meaning or message. Sorry guys.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
"touching, great and deserving any kind of prize!  A masterpiece!","It's really difficult to find any kind of words to describe this film greatness. What first seems to be a conventional boxing plot turns into an incredible, brilliant and devastating movie. Devastating is perhaps the right adjective to tell about the life experiences here handled. It also shows fight sequences but it's not about boxing at all, it's about second chances and love and also meditates on death, friendship and life failures. It's impossible not to be impressed with the grandness of the lead's performances and in particular with the level of perfection achieved by Clint Eastwood. The moving and emotional finale makes the audience wordless and breathless. Don't you dare miss this masterpiece!",,Anonymous,Drama
"Age & Craft, Both in Character and Creator","Mr. Eastwood has taken American cinema, both behind and in front of the camera, to places it could not have achieved on its own. From 'Play Misty for Me', to last year's triumph 'Mystic River', his contribution to quality simple tradecraft storytelling is of invaluable measure.As Frankie, a could have been/should have been trainer, Mr. Eastwood reminds you with startling moments that he began an actor. At a moment when you know anyone, someone, would cry, that the character Frankie would cry, you start to ask yourself 'Is Clint really going to take us there?' He does. And back again.Now to have his skillful storytelling and performance partnered with Morgan Freeman and Hillary Swank, is a treat for all. If you began to think that Ms. Swank had lost her verve, or that painful ability to swagger in an out of strength and pathos, then it will certainly be revived by this performance.The story takes a direction you do not expect. Many a director, particularly American directors, would take thirteen minutes to peak and close out this twist of tale so as to end the film within a perfect three-act structure. But not Mr. Eastwood.I was reminded of 'The Iceman Cometh' or 'Nights of Cabiria' in that the film plays itself in three equally paced, toned, acts. But never when watching are you aware of this. The transition between banter and voice over and underdog and glory and pain and mystery are kept in check by a lucid austerity of a director who knows what he is looking at. A director who knows how to tell a story.This is a painfully dull year in film. Ray is a showboat actor's piece. Sideways drags over familiarly executed material a la Alexander Payne. The Aviator; Scorcese is a talented man. Why does he keep after the semi-epic historically significant holiday release material? And where are the female performances for the year? But this is another discussion.Film? Picture? Director? The best of all categories for this year can be found inside 'Million Dollar Baby'. Morgan Freeman may be due, but will likely not take anything home. Swank, who can say. But I do know, statuette or not, this film is the best place I've gone in cinema this year.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

It has made such a lasting impact on me  I watched it a second time a few days after the first viewing, and I cried at different moments in the film, the story is so rich and the movie is so well made. I must admit, I have never been a huge Clint Eastwood fan, but he has hit it out of the park with this movie. His directing, acting, the music - just phenomenal.I realized when I was crying my eyes out at various points in the film that I had given up the fight in many respects in my own life. I don't want to ever give up the fight again, just like Maggie. Bravo to everyone involved with this film. Anybody can lose 1 fight.

Great directing. Great mixture of Boxing and Personal feelings,This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Not only with the boxing where there so called shouldn't be any heart involved it was complimented with a deep emotional theme.Not only did Clint Eastwood play the the role of Franky so well he also did an excellent job directing this. Morgan Freeman is an great actor as well he never lets his viewers down. Hillary Swank was the perfect actress for this part. With her wit and natural charm she draws viewers to her cause shes so sweet. This was difinately a tear jerker for me.

Morgan Freeman was Outstanding,"If Morgan Freeman, ( Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris) did not appear in this film it would have failed on its face, because he gave the best supporting performance I have ever seen him create. Hilary Swank, (Maggie Fitgerald) put her heart and soul into this role as a prize fighter who climbs to unbelievable heights in the world of women boxing with the great help of both Eddie Dupris and Clint Eastwood,(Frankie Dunn). Frankie Dunn constantly has gone to his church and asked the priest many questions concerning the Catholic Faith and even runs into trouble with the Priest trying to understand his frame of thinking. Frnkie Dunn asks the priest a question that will change the entire mood of the film and put it into a very controversial film concerning Life or Death. Nice film.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

One of the most deserving Oscar winners in years...,"A few years back, I came to the conclusion that if you really want to know how great a movie is, have someone tell you the ending... if you watch it and are still enthralled by it, then it's probably pretty good. It's an unfortunate test really, because I love suspense in movies, but quiet true. It began when I first saw Apollo 13. I knew the history, yet i still sat on the edge of my seat, stupidly holding my breath, wondering if the crew would survive re-entry. Now a number of people told me how Million Dollar Baby ended, and dare I say it made the movie better in someways.Eastwood creates some of the most human and endearing characters ever produced on film. I feel in love with every single one and simply found myself hoping everyone had lied to me. That somehow my copy of the film would be different... it was not. This is a touching and perfect film. Mr. Eastwood, the director, creates his most artful and technically skilled film yet, cementing himself among the great directors of all time. Swank has become the best/least known actresses in the history of film. An actress with the ability to become her role. All this is guided by the smooth voice of Freeman, making for 2 of the best hours film has produced in the past few years.A beautiful film.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Lingers in your mind for days and days,"Clint Eastwood seems to be one of only a few film makers around with any confidence. The confidence comes from the story he is telling, which he fully believes in and the way he tells it. So many directors today seem to use flashy editing and visuals in order to keep the attention of an audience with a rapidly decreasing attention span and also to cover up the flaws in whatever story is being told.Eastwood knows what a good story he is telling and therefore he allows the story to dictate the visual style and not vice - versa.What we then get is a film which is beautiful in every conceivable way from the production design, to the cinematography, and the performances. Morgan Freeman is not only one of the greatest actors alive, but also one of the greatest narrators. His narration for the film is restrained yet very powerful. It adds another dimension to a film already on the right path.From the beginning to the very end of the film I cared very much for the characters and the different spiritual journeys they take through the story. This is when I noticed what films are meant to be. 'Million Dollar Baby' reminds us how entertained and enthralled we can be from watching a good story with characters we care for and are interested in. Morgan Freeman, Clint Eastwood, and Hilary Swank give the most moving and authentic performances in many years. The flawless script by Paul Haggis and the always assured direction from Clint Eastwood elevate this film to a masterpiece. After seeing this film it lingered in my mind for days. This is what great films do and Million Dollar Baby is no exception.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

But only Unforgiven was a true classic. Now, I know he's old and we think each film might be his last, but please, people, no need to heap praise upon anything he cranks out of a camera.His performance is measured a craggy. Hillary is good, but not Oscar worthy, unless one gets an award for body morphing. Then, Anna Nicole Smith deserves one, too. All the supporting actors are two dimensional. The script is a patchwork from a book of short stories, and it feels like it. Whose perspective is the film supposed to be?

Powerful Boxing Movie,"Great story, great acting, great characters; Million Dollar Baby has it all. One of the most solidly entertaining sports movies of any sport, this one is a true winner.Clint Eastwood shows why he is one of Hollywood's all-time great actors and directors. Million Dollar Baby is one of those movies that can be discussed for hours.Maggie, played by a wonderful Hilary Swank, is determined to be trained by Frankie Dunn (Clint). Frankie doesn't train girls, and he sluffs her off. It isn't until Eddie (Morgan Freeman) who manages the boxing gym for Frankie gives Maggie some help and encouragement, that Frankie decides to take her on.Frankie is taken by Maggie's enthusiasm, will, and determination. When he meets her family and realizes that the only person in the world that she can trust is him, he pledges to see her through and develops a strong admiration and love for her.The movie tightens even more when tragedy strikes, and the closeness of the three characters is even more pronounced. All the characters stay true to form; Maggies family as opportunistic, greedy, trailer trash; Frankie as Maggie's best friend, and Frankie as the steadying influence throughout the movie.Exceptionally strong acting by all the stars, which is to be expected. It is no coincidence that the narration of the movie by Morgan Freeman could remind one of another classic that he narrated, ""The Shswshank Redemption"". The supporting characters, especially Jay Baruchel playing a very entertaining ""Danger"", did a wonderful job as well.Million Dollar Baby is as inspirational as ""Rocky"", but with better acting and a more powerful ending.

Also blends humor into this movie that is genuinely...funny! great subplots with the skinny little boxer and the Morgan Freeman character.

While I am not a movie critic I find myself in that position after seeing Million Dollar Baby. My critic would not be based on the artistic value of the production or indeed the performance of the actors (although both in my opinion were excellent), I am not qualified to do so. My critic has more to do with the position that some folks have regarding the subject matter (and it is not Boxing) and their refusal to allow science to deal with alternatives to the end result of this painful movie.I would really like to talk more about this but I think the movie stirs a debate and people need to see it.

Masterpiece,"Much of how I rate a film is based on whether or not I, at any moment during the viewing, become conscious of the passage of actual time; that is, that I am actually conscious at any given moment of viewing a movie in a real time-space continuum. If a movie carries me along and causes me, in a fairly complete way, or as completely as possible, to be oblivious to my surroundings, then I believe the story is being told in a skillful and masterful way. You can split hairs over technique and other such minutia, but, the extent of how a movie accomplishes the above determines for me and, I believe, for others how good a film really is.Million Dollar Baby accomplishes the above for me in a way that no other movie has done; at least in recent memory. There is no doubt in my mind that Million Dollar Baby is a masterpiece. Give Clint Eastwood the credit he is surely due. There are a lot of his directorial efforts (at least the ones I have seen which does not include Mystic River)that have been great. But, they have also been in what I like to call the ""almost nearly but not quite hardly"" category.To coin some boxing terminology, Eastwood goes the distance on this one. I now consider MDB the best movie of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Knocks you flat...,"The best way for one to enter the viewing experience of this movie is to read nothing about it first. But since that is impossible for most people- I know I can't pay $9 for a movie ticket without at least getting a feel for the critical waters, I will do as best I can to summarize what I feel is the movie deserving of all of the major Oscar categories, even if the criminal snubbing of Martin Scorcese has to continue for yet another year.Million Dollar Baby is a film that will put you through a wringer of emotions that will make you feel like you've been in the boxing ring yourself. Although Unforgiven is still, in my opinion, Eastwood's masterpiece in film-making, MDB is definitely going to be Clint's twilight opus. Although the man isn't exactly on death's door, there are only a limited number of films left in him. And if this is the last film he ever makes, then he has certainly gone out with a bang.I guarantee you- if you see this film, you will be genuinely touched and moved. None of the actors- Morgan Freeman, Hilary Swank, and even Clint Eastwood himself, have been better. If anything, a film such as Million Dollar Baby has served to remind me what a dull and lonely world we will be in when great filmmakers and actors like Freeman and Eastwood are no longer among us, just as the world became less lively and funny when Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthou left us.I apologize that this review is not more specific. It is because the most profound experiences I've had in movies came only when I knew very little about what I was about to see. All you need to know is this is a truly moving story about the human condition. That Clint Eastwood has made a film that will make you think about how you view certain issues, and should at the very least give you pause. That the characters in Million Dollar Baby are ones who will stay with you for a very long time, and that you will never forget them.

"An Excellent Addition To Any Movie Collection.  Million Dollar Baby Is Simply Put, Brilliant.","After months of hearing about Million Dollar Baby and the hype surrounding it, I finally got to see it. I actually went in with low expectations but was very pleased to find out that it lives up to the hype! It really is that good.Million Dollar Baby is basically about a tough woman named Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) who lives for boxing and wants to go as far as she can with it. Therefore, she finds the right person she wants to train and manage her and refuses to quit until he accepts her. As you can imagine, the boxing plays a huge role in this story but around half way to three quarters of the way through, the movie takes an unexpected dark turn. I don't go into many details because I don't want to spoil it. I saw this movie without hearing a thing about it and I believe it was much better not knowing what to expect or even what kind of movie it starts off as and metamorphoses into.I know from what I have written, the movie seems a bit cliché'd, and certain parts may be, but the movie itself is nothing but a cliché. It is a great story that is more about the boxer than boxing. While I was expecting somewhat of a female Rocky, it became something quite different. If you are expecting another Girl Fight, Honeybee, etc., look someplace else because you will get well more than expected here.Hilary Swank plays the boxer very convincingly. She obviously went through an immense amount of training to ready herself for this role and I have to say, she nailed it. Not only does she show us what she has in the ring, she shows us she can act with the best of them.I like to compare Clint Eastwood to John Wayne. Not just here but in almost every movie. They are similar because they always play the same roles. Some people may hate me for saying this, but this is the first Eastwood film that I really liked. Blood Work was all right, but this movie is much better. I give him kudos for his director and producing talents here. Anyone can act the same part for 50 years and get it right. I don't mean this as an insult, but just so you know not to expect anything new from him.Morgan Freeman plays Eddie Dupris, a former boxer who is narrating the story. He also seems to be a mediator between Frankie (Eastwood) and Maggie, at least until Frankie accepts her.Add Danger (Jay Baruchel) for comic relief as the semi-retarded wannabe boxer and you have a nice little movie.Million Dollar Baby is an outstanding movie which I can compare to American Beauty in 1999. I went into both without expectations and left knowing that I had seen something great and simply put, brilliant. 10/10",,Anonymous,Drama
One in a Million,"Director Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby"" is truly a moving and touching motion picture. Powerful. This power derives from amazing actors, an unflinching and uncompromising screenplay by Paul Haggis, and a master director at the zenith of his power. This is the best movie of the year, and Eastwood's finest work. His gift for simplicity and eloquence is absolutely stunning. In writing this comment and acknowledgment, there is apprehension that I may be missing the same respect and integrity that Eastwood has for his audience. The controversial attention given to the story line, which I will not dwell upon, is warranted-- I suppose. Ultimately, it is a matter of choice. And ultimately, regardless of the power of a movie, it is still a movie. That being said, Hilary Swank who inhabits the role of Maggie Fritzgerald, is my favorite all-time movie hero. Her Maggie has such an earnestness, a purity of heart, and spirit that are awe inspiring. Maggie goes after what she wants with everything she's got. Swank truly gives life and soul to Haggis's words and Eastwood's direction. Swank, aside from undergoing hard physical training to bring tough as nails Boxer Maggie to life, also tempers her with a genuine charm, especially when she breaks out a tiny smile that warms your heart. Swank deserves an Oscar for her performance.Maggie is trailer trash, and she knows it. She has a fierce intelligence, and black and white sense. She sees being a professional boxer as her only way to make it. Thus, she saves all the money she makes as a waitress, so she can be trained by legendary cut man and trainer, Frankie Dunn (Eastwood). At first Frankie dismisses Maggie. Maggie is 31 years old, too old. It takes four years just to train a fighter, and she can't even hit a speed bag. Then Maggie tells him, if she can't make it as a boxer ""...I may as well get a trailer home. Buy a deep fryer, and bag of Oreoes."" That catches our attention much like Frankie's. He takes her on as his charge. Haggis's screenplay based on the stories by F.X. Poole has a stark and authentic quality and consistency that are admirable.Morgan Freeman as Scraps Dupris is the conscience of ""Million Dollar Baby"", and also it's narrator-- the reason later revealed. Scraps works for Frankie in his Gym. Scraps was a contender years ago. Frankie blames himself for a fight in which Scraps lost the use of his eye. Scraps is the one who first brings Maggie to Frankie's attention. Freeman is a great actor, one never catches him acting. His performance is commanding in it's understated nature. There is a breathtaking scene in the diner, where Scraps tells Maggie how he lost his eye in the fight. He (Freeman) is just talking, and Maggie (Swank) is just listening-- really listening. This is stripped down Eastwood at his best.Actor Clint Eastwood as trainer Frankie Dunn gives a compelling performance displaying such an ease, strength, and vulnerability. Eastwood is still evolving as an actor. His Frankie has an incomplete relationship with an unseen and estranged daughter. Thus, his relationship with Maggie makes sense. They fill in a missing in each other's life. Eastwood possesses this powerful silent presence, that few actors have. In a scene where Maggie is devastated when her Mom ( an effective Margo Martindale) rejects the house that Maggie bought for her, because this would cut off her Mom's welfare check, Eastwood stands silently outside the doorway. Nothing need be said. On the drive back, Maggie says quietly, ""Frankie, you're all I've got."" He replies ""You've got me."" The chemistry between Eastwood and Swank is magical, and what makes ""Million Dollar Baby"" so special and compelling.The movie ends quietly, and is absolutely moving. And the audience is also silent. Eastwood's vision always has an authenticity about it. He always respects the intelligence of his audience, and our ability to make our own choices and judgments. I truly applaud all the effort and talent involved in making ""Million Dollar Baby"". I think Eastwood's movie captures all that is courageous, compassionate, and noble.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

The ending of this film really tugs on your heartstrings. The lighting of the movie is another indication that Clint Eastwood is as good at directing as he is at acting. Every character is almost hidden in shadows, giving the impression that all is not as it seems.

Veterans bring seasoned fists but fresh perspective to boxing drama,"Boxing, despite the sport's decline in popularity since the '80s, has managed to make for some of the best films. Starting with ""Rocky"" and then films such as ""Raging Bull,"" boxing has is one of those things that seems to best represent life's journey and its struggles. There might not be a stronger visual metaphor than the glory and physical danger of someone with a goal laying it all on the line in the ring. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is the latest film to exploit this genre, and armed with great talents it manages to do so with a fresh point of view.Talent number one is Morgan Freeman. He could narrate what I did yesterday and it would be considered Oscar-worthy. There is no one better to impart wisdom to an audience and half of why ""Million Dollar Baby"" communicates its ideas and themes so clearly is because of him.Talent number two is Paul Haggis, producer and screenwriter. Haggis takes stories by F.X Toole and crafts something that boxing-movie lovers haven't seen before. It doesn't lean entirely on the exhausted underdog cliché (""Rocky"") or the 'rise and fall of a star' one either (""Raging Bull"").This underdog, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), is more complex and more troubled. Knowing full well she's Southern white trash, she still spends whatever money she has to join the club owned by old-time boxing trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood, who also directs) and tells the stubborn old grouch that she won't leave until he trains her. After taking a few tips from the club's assistant manager, a retired and half-blind former boxer named Scrap (Morgan Freeman), she captures his attention and he agrees to help her toward her dream of being a boxer.""Million Dollar Baby"" is about ambition, about establishing yourself as something and achieving in even the smallest way. Of all the boxing movies, its themes are the most universal. We all want to leave this life knowing we didn't waste it and ""Million Dollar Baby"" wrestles with this on levels both obvious and subtle through its central characters.The final talent is Mr. Oscar -- Eastwood. His film is very quiet, shadow-enveloped and contemplative. He lets the characters tell this story and our interest in them keeps our attention. The actors also fit their roles perfectly. Swank has proved she can do Southern American gender ambiguous in ""Boys Don't Cry,"" Freeman has shown wise supporting role prowess in ""Shawshank Redemption,"" and Clint Eastwood redefined tough for the silver screen in his career, making him perfect for the troubled role of Frankie.Everything comes together in this film effortlessly. That's what veteran filmmakers do. Though Haggis at this point was relatively unestablished, his storytelling is elegant and the veterans behind him make the script succeed in its every purpose. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a sports drama, but not like you might think. Boxing is the vehicle for delivering a knock out punch of a greater sort, one that brings us unique characters and a terrific story.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Well done, but it's been done before","Million Dollar Baby is a tired story done well. Everything here has been seen before, apart from the last 20 minutes. What makes it different is that everything is done well. The acting is spectacular all around, in fact, it's easy to forget that it's all been done before (though Morgan Freeman's role is too short for Oscar worthiness. Not that it means he didn't deserve the statue.). Clint Eastwood gets every effect and emotion that he can out of every frame. Paul Haggis's screenplay uses the simple grit of everyday life poetically. While there is a very familiar storyline, the plot elements have been used in ways that make them seem fresh. I mentioned that the last 20 minutes is different than what has been seen before. This is true, and I do not want to give anything away. But the rest of the film leaves such an impression that what originality is left has been tainted. Is this an Oscar worthy picture? Perhaps, for the acting and the directing and the writing. But not Best Picture.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Million Dollar Baby: one of the BEST movies of all time.,"Million Dollar Baby, I sit here watching it in 2008 and it is still as fabulous now as it was the first time I saw it in 2005. It is my favorite movie of all time: Clint Eastwood does a beautiful score, he is right on the money. The character development is so wonderful. The relationship between Maggie, Scrap, and Frankie is amazing.It's honest, and moving and sincere. There is no other movie that I love so much. A dear friend of mine is a paralyzed man who had that same glory prior to his accident that Maggie did. The way the movie touches on that is amazing. Maggie's heart and Clint Eastwood's conscious ... The speech she gives to him about ""going home buying a used trailer, deep fryer and some Oreos,"" makes me cry EVERY SINGLE time. It's the beauty in her face, her enthusiasm in working with him. If you don't enjoy this movie and it does not move you: you need to really re-evaluate everything in your life, my friend. The line, ""Yeah this is my fighter..."" Beautiful. Everything and I do mean EVERYTHING in MDB is beautiful. It's the best movie, I believe, to have been made in my life time. Thank you Clint Eastwood - for a life time of beautiful movie moments.",,Anonymous,Drama

"First-class, first-rate, movie MAGIC.","An absolute masterpiece. Million Dollar Baby is an exemplary movie experience, commendable in every way. Seeing this film once, is definitely not enough. Hilary Swank gives a magnificent performance as an aspiring female boxer with a heart of gold. Clint Eastwood is outstanding as the grief-stricken boxing trainer, who reluctantly takes a chance on the zealous 31year old. Morgan Freeman is resplendent in his role, as a gym maintenance-man, who quietly observes his surroundings with a keen and intelligent eye. The supporting cast also deserve credit for their solid performances. Masterfully, directed by Clint Eastwood, Million Dollar Baby is truly 'one in a million'.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Eastwood triumphs yet again,"Usually when the latest 'big thing' gets released, I go to cinema and end up disappointed. With Million Dollar Baby, however; that was not the case. Clint Eastwood's latest film is a powerful blend of believable characters and raw, gritty realism. The film benefits from Clint Eastwood's assured, no frills directing style immensely as it gives the film it's potent edge, and the lack of trickery ensures that our attention is never distracted from the characters and storyline. Clint spends the first twenty minutes of the movie setting the scene, which therefore allows the audience to get to know the score, before taking us on an emotional and physical roller-coaster ride through a myriad of emotions. This allows Eastwood to play with his viewer's emotions without the necessity to concentrate on the central theme of boxing - and Million Dollar Baby is all the better a film for it.Clint Eastwood made a name for himself by playing a character that you cant possibly disagree with. In movies like Sergio Leone's 'Dollar' trilogy, down to his own films, such as High Plains Drifter and Unforgiven; we are with Clint every step of the way, no matter what evil deeds he's doing. He perfected the anti-hero and proved that an audience can be fully behind any character. For this movie, Clint has given himself a support role, and all the faith that we would usually put him has been transferred to Hilary Swank. Hilary Swank is absolutely perfect in this movie, and anyone that says otherwise is sadly mistaken. She approaches her role with all the determination that epitomises her character on screen, and delivers a fine performance with it. Emotionally as well as physically, Swank never gives us a reason to doubt that she is Maggie Fitzgerald; the character she plays on screen. If Swank doesn't walk away with the Best Actress award for 2004, there is something seriously wrong. Despite taking a back step, Eastwood still manages to retain that which he made his name with. Once again, Eastwood is the downbeat loner - the man who comes along and changes thing; the catalyst of the story. This performance is much more mature than the work Eastwood did in his earlier movies, and may well go on to represent the twilight years of this classic actor.The way that Eastwood gets the audience behind his central character is simply breathtaking. During the boxing scenes especially, Clint's subdued style lends them a potent realism and the audience feels every punch thrown and every wound endured. The boxing scenes are also testament to Eastwood's triumph with characterisation as well as technical potency, as we follow Maggie Fitzgerald every step of the way. When she takes a punch, we feel it too and when she delivers a blow - the audience is able to feel the adrenaline pumping, the same as the character does on screen. It's one of the hardest things to make an audience feel for a character, but Million Dollar Baby, not satisfied with just making us feel  allows us to become one with the emotions on screen. However, all is not rosy in the almost perfect garden that Eastwood has created. Basically, it's the musical score. Million Dollar Baby is a powerful film, and just the images and dialogue alone is enough to convey the story to the audience and make them feel for the characters - but for some reason, many scenes are saturated in a horrible rural style beat and it doesn't do the film any favours at all. Music almost always adds to the images on screen, but sometimes no music is better. I almost feel like I'm nitpicking as the film is so close to perfection, but it's a niggling little aspect of it that annoyed me.Million Dollar Baby is not one of those films that comes along and changes the cinematic landscape. However, it's a powerful drama with some excellent acting, great direction and a brilliant storyline. I'm not a boxing fan, but when it comes to films like this; it doesn't matter what you like. Usually when I go to the cinema, there's a mad rush to the doors at the end  no matter what the film  but this wasn't the case with Million Dollar Baby. Everyone in the cinema sat in their seats until the end credits rolled, and although I cant speak for everyone; I did so because the film is so utterly spellbinding and I needed the time for the credits to roll to catch my breath. I don't need to say this but I will: see this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Reminds us of what is missing in films today!,"One of the reasons that I don't like going to the movies now is the violence and profanity that fills films rather than great meaningful dialogue. I knew the ending which is why I didn't want to see it. I didn't agree with it which is the only reason that I am giving it a 9. I found the relationship between Clint Eastwood and Hilary Swank to be both beautiful, meaningful, and surprisingly platonic which is rare in movies today. There is too much focus on sexuality and this film lacks it completely. The relationship is more father and daughter than anything else. Clint's character Frankie Dunn finds a willing substitute in Hilary Swank's character, Maggie Fitzgerald. Her character recalls her father fondly in spoken memories only. She does not share the same fondness for her mother and other living relatives. Maggie follows her dream to box professionally which her mother disapproves. Maggie works hard, long hours of waitressing. She saves her pennies and even brings home scraps of leftover food. Hunger and poverty is never really talked about in films anyway. Maggie is a strong character who never gives up her dreams and she is loyal to her trainer, Frankie Dunn who learns to train her. The film's ending still leaves me asking more questions. I am not a person who cries easily and I had tears in my eyes. Morgan Freeman is also wonderful and deserved his Academy Award. In any other year, Clint would have won for Best Actor too and Hilary's performance is both heartbreaking and Oscar winning. She is the best actress of her generation with her own heartbreaking story. She always gives it her all in film and this is no exception.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

A Great Film,"""Million Dollar Baby"" is Clint Eastwood's best film as a director (at least so far , he's still young at 74).It tops even ""Mystic River"".The story involves a young trailer park trash woman, wonderfully played by Hillary Swank, who thinks she can become a boxer.She has been waiting on tables for more than half her life, her life is at a total stand still and she has no way to go other than boxing.She comes to Clint Eastwood's gym and refuses to leave and he eventually agrees to train her.Morgan Freemen,excellent as always,plays Eastwood's best friend, former client and janitor and rounds out the cast in this small, three-person drama.Names you always, always remember from the movies include Hal 9000, Fred C.Dobbs and Marge Gunderson.It's the damnedest thing.What's so unusual about the names ""Marge Gunderson"" and ""Fred Dobbs""? Perfectly ordinary, there are probably many people named that.And yet, I don't recall the names of the main characters from ""Casablanca"" but remember the ones from ""Fargo"" and ""The Treasure of the Sierra Mountains"".""MDB"" is newest addition to the list.Instead of in labels such as ""the boxer"" ""the trainer"" ""the best friend"",you speak of the characters by name as if they are real people.For two thirds of its running time, ""MDB"" is a pretty standard rags-to-riches, underdog-triumphs boxing movie and one of the best since ""Rocky"".Then it completely takes another turn and truly finds greatness.It's a masterpiece, pure and simple.Maggie is paralyzed from the neck down in a fight.She asks Frankie to put her out of her misery.At first, he flatly refuses.After she attempts suicide, he gives in and kills her.Maggie's decision is wrong.In most cases, euthanasia is morally wrong. If I were in her place, I'd be devastated and maybe suicidally depressed but would learn to live with it.In fact,not being a good dancer or athlete,I might happier in a wheelchair and only occasionally miss jogging,swimming and not having to depend on others for literally everything from wiping my nose to going down the street.As long as I could still go to the movies, I'd be reasonably okay.Some of the most famous people in the world are paraplegics; look at the lives of Stephen Hawking, Christopher Reeve, Christy Brown, Larry Flynt or Muhammad Ali.But Maggie is a boxer.Being a quadriplegic is a death sentence for her, like being a prisoner inside her own body.She only asks Frankie after she loses her leg.Losing her body is the worst possible thing that could ever happen to her and she doesn't have an educated mind to go on.There is another reason she does what she does; except for Frankie and maybe Eddie, she's all alone in the world. We meet her unloving family twice, including her selfish, stupid mother. In one great scene, Frankie and Maggie go on a visit to her family.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Phenomenal... The best film of the year!,"So I decided to go see Million Dollar baby on a whim after it was nominated for best picture and boy was I disappointed with myself. For not rushing out to see this astonishing motion picture. Clint Eastwood becomes a master of film with the story of a struggling woman coming out of her youthful prime whom is dying to be trained by him for women's boxing. He's a scruffy old fashioned guy who doesn't believe in training girls and cares to much about his fighters to watch them get hurt, sometimes blocking them from excelling. She is basically defined by herself to be white trash she works very hard as a waitress by day and eats peoples scraps off their plates to survive. She saves all her excess money to train at the gym and for equipment. In some of the film's saddest and most powerful scenes she confronts her trashy family and they have not a thread of redemability. Hilary Swank remains in her finest hour here even after her amazing performance in Boys Don't Cry if she doesn't get an Oscar for this it would be crime. Clint Eastwood is a masterful director and a star he directs the film with passion and acts with conviction. the film covers extremely dark territory and still manages to find some light in it. never before has a film based on any sport including Rocky hit such emotionally depressing depths. That are as memorable as they are powerful, littered with the years finest moments and talent Million Dollar Baby is phenomenal it leads the pack for the bets film of the year! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
In a word ... sublime,"Who would have predicted that Clint Eastwood, an actor who started his career in spaghetti westerns forty years ago, would mature into a formidable composer, director, all around film icon, and last but certainly not least, auteur.Like a fine wine, Eastwood gets better with age, and this film is his crowning achievement to date. In some ways, it is an old fashioned film that echoes The Shawshank Redemption in theme, tone and texture; in other ways, it is thoroughly post-modern.It is a sad film at its core, but somehow uplifting in its sadness, like a sad blues or jazz piece.

Only thing I would have like to see was more revenge on the family and slime ball German Boxer. 10 out of 10..... Sideways was great, Baby was better..... Swank deserved all the accolades given.

The Winner!,"I had the interesting experience of seeing ""Million Dollar Baby"" late yesterday afternoon, an hour or so before the Oscars. Having previously seen most of the other nominees for best picture as well as the performances up for awards, I had no difficulty in figuring out how I would have voted if I'd been eligible. ""Million Dollar Baby"" was the easy winner, as were Morgan Freeman, Hillary Swank, and Clint Eastwood for best director. This is a small picture by recent Hollywood standards but it is worthy of every honor it received. The only wasted moment in the entire movie comes the near the end when the incompetent young boxing hopeful, earlier beaten to a pulp, returns to try again. I could have done without that. However, the basic story is told with rare economy. Contrast that with ""Ray"" which is distended and directed with monumental self-indulgence by Taylor Hackford, another nominee for best director. I don't know that I would have given the best acting award to Eastwood. Though he combines surface restraint and inner turmoil in a brilliant realization of the trainer/manager to Swank's Maggie, Jamie Foxx certainly had the showier role -- and he was quite good in it. For myself, however, I would have given the Oscar to Don Cheadle for his performance in ""Hotel Rwanda"" as the hotel manager who reluctantly at first but ultimately at great personal cost and risk saves hundreds from slaughter. Swank and Freeman won the prizes they earned, and Clint Eastwood won the two Oscars he most deserved. Scorcese will win some other day.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Clint Eastwood as ""Frankie"" Goes to Hollywood with Swank and Rope Burns","""'I don't train girls,' trainer Frankie Dunn growls. But something's different about the spirited boxing hopeful who shows up daily at Dunn's gym. All she wants is a fighting chance. Clint Eastwood plays Dunn and directs, produces and composes music for this acclaimed, multi-award-winning tale of heart, hope and family. Hilary Swank plays resilient Maggie, determined not to abandon her one dream. And Morgan Freeman is Scrap, gym caretaker and counterpoint to Dunn's crustiness. Grab your dreams and come out swinging. 'Million Dollar Baby' is an absolute knockout.""Clint Eastwood Hits the Nail on the Head.I expected this film to be a ""feminist"" version of the traditional male-dominated ""boxing movie"". It opens with a realistic depiction of the kind of physical damage boxing causes - so, I thought, are they going to show Q-Tips being shoved into the bloody, slit open face of movie star Hillary Swank? I thought not Although Ms. Swank does not suffer a wound like the one in the introduction, ""Million Dollar Baby"" does not skirt this issue. The film is as realistic as they come. Swank is amazing, absolutely earning her many ""Best Actress"" honors.""She grew up knowing one thing, she was trash.""Auteur Eastwood is even more incredible - as producer, director, star, and composer. He uses his years of film-making experience wisely, and does not let one role interfere with another. The goal of a superior film is achieved, with generosity rather than egotism in evidence. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is, also, the crowning achievement of the ""Eastwood style"". The lighting is exquisite. The film is quiet when it should be quiet, and noisy when it should be NOISY. The harder-to-manage ""quietness"" is expertly handled. The film is beautiful without being loud - it's starkly beautiful.Eastwood allows his audience to become a part of this movie.Morgan Freeman gives one of filmdom's all-time ""Best Supporting Actor"" performances. His character's narration gives the film poetry. Narration is one of the easiest techniques to administer, but one of the hardest to muster convincingly; Mr. Freeman's is most convincing. And, Freeman's more subtle counterpoint story - his relationship with slow-witted Jay Baruchel (as Danger ""Flip"" Barch) - gives the film hope. Mr. Baruchel might have won a ""Best Supporting the Best Supporting Actor"" award (as of this writing, not introduced).""Boxing is about respect - getting it for yourself and taking it away from the other guy.""""Million Dollar Baby"" is about loving, non-sexual and non-familial relationships (count the number of sexually involved ""couples"" in this film), and how very important these relationships are to our lives, and dreams. ""Somewhere between nowhere and goodbye,"" Eastwood echoes Lloyd Price, ""Just because you left and said goodbye, do you think that I will sit and cry?

Conservative mythologies,"MILLION DOLLAR BABY is Clint Eastwood's bode and homage to the world of traditional conservative values of the poor pulling themselves up by their bootstraps, the tough-love authoritarian father figure, and the stereotype hatred of poor white trash welfare chiselers. In many of Eastwood's films, the former mayor of Carmel puts forward a world of simplistic virtue and moralistic black and white that you often see old men in diners declaim as lost to sophistry and complexity.In MDB Eastwood's characters all verge on flat one-dimensional stereotypes, Morgan Freeman (puts in a good performance that defies its shallowness on paper) plays the washed-up boxer who lives in the storage closet of the gym. Hillary Swank is a desperate waitress who tries to escape grinding poverty and trailer trash ignorance by looking for a strong father-like authoritarian who, at first, attempts to disabuse her of foolish ambitions. The worse one-dimensional stereotypes come from Eastwoods depiction of Maggies family of crooks and overweight baby-producing welfare cheats.The cartoon-like script treatment of the characters throws you out of the film's narrative and do not serve the excellent acting by Swank and Freeman. This is carefully contrived political ideology that ends with the well-worn emotional manipulation verging on melodrama.

a knockout of a drama,"Clint Eastwood (Dirty Harry) stars as Frankie, an emotional boxing trainer who takes a determined Maggie under his wing and trains her to compete at competitive levels.Being a fan of Scorsese's Raging Bull and Michael Mann's Ali, I was eager to see this Oscar winning drama and was able to sit and be engaged into a slow and touching plot about the human spirit.Eastwood leads the way as Frankie, a man with a whole lot of personal history that keeps him from making quick decisions, and gives a deserved Oscar nominated performance in his picture, which he also directs beautifully. Through the character's history, does Eastwood capitalize on bringing out the character's weaker side and he does it to perfection, though it's not Eastwood who steals the limelight.Hilary Swank (Boys don't cry) gives an Oscar winning performance as Maggie, another character with the past casting shadows over her judgement and with the characters both having similar characteristics and interests, does a great on screen partnership start to blossom into an emotional tale.Morgan Freeman (Shawshank Redemption) likewise receives an Oscar for his performance as Scraps. Not in the film nearly enough for viewers to get to know him, Freeman does great with what he has. Jay Baruchel plays Danger, a weak person in the mind of so many others and is emotional to watch the character on screen.After a pretty dull opening does the film pick up as we get to know the characters more and the plot comes intriguing with personal issues the focus in this drama.The plot is consistent once it gets going and with a strong line of personalities the viewers are thrust into their lives as they deal with personal and professional lives.The fights are tense and interesting to watch, none more so than the final one of the film, leaving to a sad and dramatic climax.Stronger than Ali and equally as dramatic as Raging Bull, Million Dollar Baby is one of the great boxing dramas ever made with excellent performances which show in a beautifully directed drama.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Directing Perfection for Eastwood,"Let me say first that I am no fan of Clint Eastwood's movies. I didn't like 'Unforgiven' or 'Mystic River,' both critics' darlings, so I was expecting something along the same vein for this film. In both those other films the focus is on men. In this case, it's Hillary Swank's character, Maggie, and it makes all the difference for me because I like a little estrogen in my films. The story is enthralling and character driven - with a focus on all three characters. Now some are very upset by the ending of the film but I felt complete empathy and so did Joe, who I had to basically bribe to see the movie. And he LOVED it. The direction of the film is perfection - Eastwood uses incredible shadow work and several styles that enhance the story so much, that I can't imagine any other director doing the film. While I saw some editing problems in Aviator, and some flaws in the directorial shots, I saw NONE of that here, and I've read Eastwood took only a little over a month to shoot it. Amazing! He wins best director in my mind.The acting is fantastic - I can't even put into words how the actors melt into their characters. I didn't see Clint Eastwood - I saw cut man Frankie Dunn. I loved Jamie Foxx in Ray, but for me Eastwood won the Oscar for me. Of course Swank is awesome (I even loved her in Next Karate Kid) and should also win the Oscar. Morgan Freeman is always perfect and his chemistry with Eastwood is better than any other film I've seen yet this year.Normally I wouldn't recommend seeing a movie like this on the big screen but the boxing scenes are so cool that I would say it is worth the price of admission.

Million Dollar Baby,"Million Dollar Baby starring Hillary Swank, Clint Eastwood, and Morgan Freeman is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. I think that it deserves most of the awards that it won. This movie is about Maggie,a southern girl who works as a waitress and will take the leftover food from her customer and lie that it is for her dog because she can hardly afford anything for herself. Then she starts to want to box. In the opening scene you see her watching a boxing match. At the end of the fight she tries to talk to one of the managers of one of the boxers to see if he wanted to manage her. He denies her and then the next day she decides to go over to his gym. After she has been at the gym everyday and working very hard, Scraps, Morgan Freeman's character, comes and corrects her on some of her mistakes. Frankie, Clint Eastwood's character, finally manages her. You'll have to watch the rest to find out what happens next. This is a sad, happy, moving, amazing, and very unpredictable moving movie that shows how much effort and work you have to do to become a great boxer.

Swank comes from a lower class struggling background from the family from hell.In some ways it is part Rocky, but it goes it own way, and the emotional roller-coaster of the movie hinges on that the girl becomes like a surrogate daughter for Eastwood as he is cut off from his own estranged daughter.Very humorous at times, but you can't help be chocked at the end of the film.Class movie.8/10 definites.....",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

It's hard to imagine that a prized fighter would train in such a run-down decrepit old gym. Isn't it a coincidence that two exceptional fighters would both come out of the same gym seemingly in the middle of nowhere, white trash America? But this movie was so realistic in its dialog that I forgot about all that.

I am a big fan of Martie Scorcese, and I really do want him to win the best picture or best director Oscars. And I really just thought that Million dollar Baby was another dramatic boxing film like Rocky, etc. But when I saw the film, I was blown away.Blown away? Yes, by its originality and realistic film making.The film was not over-acted, and Swank was good. For Clint, I really don't know about his acting but the leading actor of Sideways is better than him and should be nominated for an Oscar (what's his name?). I think Clint lack the real emotion for a hurting father. He just squinted for an Oscar nomination. And Morgan's acting was not the usual (strong person-eloquent-type), and he deserves the Oscar.But I salute Clint for his tasteful direction. Bravo! Simple and effective.I hope Marty Scorcese will win someday, I am a bigger fan of his films, but not this year. My heart went to Million dollar Baby for 2005.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"No special effects, no glitz, just raw human emotion","The best movie I have seen in ten years! There's no special effects, hype, glitz or glamour! Just a wonderful movie that highlights the power of dreams and raw human spirit. The nominations it has received are well-deserved! From the opening scenes to the closing credits, I was enthralled. Hilary Swank (the new Julia Roberts?) makes Maggie come alive. From joy to sorrow to struggle, she IS Maggie. Her fighting spirit and determination to achieve a goal are inspiring. Clint Eastwood out did himself on the direction of this film and his portrayal of Frankie. A man who finally opens himself up to another, he will never be the same.

Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood walked together under a triumphal arch,"Very small amount before Maggie Fitzgerald succeeded, she defeated against life. I got upset till Scrap taught us that moving forward to target is more valuable than reaching target.He did not philosophize for the situation. It was pure fact of life. I learned the theory well. On the other hand, putting into practice have quite a few problems. But all of can cope with them. Maggie Fitzgerald indicated it with gigantic way.

inspiring movie,"When Million dollar baby first came out, I didn't expect so much, especially after seeing a lot of bad movies about boxing, so I thought this one will be soon forgot. But when I came out of the theater I felt something I hadn't felt in a lot of time. This movie makes you think, makes you want to reach your dreams and it even makes you cry. It has a very moving and inspiring story and Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman are so good in their performances that, in some scenes, you almost forget that they're talking about old socks and lemon pie.

The baby who can't reach the million dollar target,"Million Dollar Baby is Clint Eastwood's most recent appearance on big screen after Bloodwork. Witb the strong cast of Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman together with Eastwood himself, it was supposed to be one of his best films he made.However, i would say i prefer his previous production, Mystic River.Million Dollar Baby is more of a journey of how Maggie Fitzgerald, which was portrayed by Hilary Swank, becomes a female boxer, whom she insisted to be trained by ex-fighter, Frankie Dunn (Eastwood), who now runs a old gym, together with his previous fighter, Eddie Scrap (Freeman). This somehow goes a distance from what the plot should be.Million Dollar Baby do not have the suspense of Mystic River, but magnifies the ugliness of human being. From the style of how the boxer fights, the training session in the gym to Maggie mother's attitude on preferring money over a new house when Maggie bought a new house for her family members, Eastwood brings in the ugliness to the audience through the group of less fortunates social level.Hilary Swank makes another excellent performance after her award winning role in Boy's Don't Cry. Morgan Freeman, on the other hand, seems to be suffering from malnutrition in terms of dialogue. He doesn't have much dialogue in the film, and neither did he make any breakthrough performances. However, he narrates the film, which will be discuss later.Now back to Eastwood. His performance as a former boxer cum Maggie's coach has not been affected by his 'cowboy image' from his previous well-known cowboy shows. But in terms of direction, it brings back the wordy dialogue, minus the suspense.What makes the movie watchable was the narration by Freeman. Beginning with how Eastwood becomes a trainer, Freeman tells the story of the main characters through his eyes and his experience. If the film was narrated by Eastwood, it would gives us another side of the story, which can make Million better.In all, the baby fails to earn an million, but managed to earned 3/5 of a million.There are times where",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"my darling, my blood","The characters are tough both in appearance and thought, but that's not the way to decide about who they really are. Boxing has made them so.

You may even lose your eye, but you are still in the world of boxing, exactly as you are still alive.The film is delicate in its own unique ways. It is about courage, heart, hope, and fear.

Worthy  -  perhaps overly-so and very Americanised in its self conscious protesting of valuable issues,"Million Dollar BabyMillion Dollar Baby 7/10 Hilary Swank, as she did in Boys Don't Cry, has transformed herself physically for the part. Emotionally, intellectually, physically and - in terms of determination - spiritually, she *is* the character, and it's a stunning achievement. (She plays an underprivileged girl who wants to succeed as a boxer and eventually persuades Clint Eastwood to coach her.)Sadly, while it's an undoubtedly well (enough) made film, the directing, and acting elsewhere, is to my mind hardly of the calibre to justify the accolades the film is receiving generally. America, if not many other Western audiences, have become so inured to that self-congratulatory style where the camera zooms in for a close up and the actor holds an expression slightly longer than necessary for that 'Oscar moment'. These audiences, in my opinion, should get out more to some good traditional French cinema and see how lacking such Hollywoodized performances are compared to the European tradition of acting in a more 'natural' and believable way.Another reason for the over-hype on Million Dollar Baby, is probably because the themes towards the end of the film (without giving too much away) now firmly belong to the almost trendy political left wing liberalism that many like to embrace. Whilst possibly putting myself in that camp, I am not in this case convinced that the way it is dealt with here justifies the extravagant kudos the movie has acquired over its more cinematic merits. I can only give it 7/10, but if I were in America (USA) I'd probably give it more, simply because it may have some good socially effect in that morally moribund and religiously intolerant country.Million Dollar Baby is a very good film, but over-long and too full of it's own self-importance for my taste.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Possibly Clint's Best....,"I went in to the theater today to see Million Dollar Baby with high expectations. After all the reviews have been great and the awards are starting to rack up for both the actors and the other people involved with this movie.I was not disappointed. This is a great film, possibly Clint Eastwood's best work as an actor and director. Clint plays grizzled fight trainer Frankie Dunn, a ham and eggs kind of guy with a very gruff exterior. When we first meet Frankie he is carefully managing the career of a rising star boxer from the trainer's hardscrabble gym. Frankie seems to be bringing this fighter along too carefully, as there is a championship bout awaiting. Later in the film we learn the reasons Frankie is careful with his boxers.Right at the beginning of the film we meet Maggie Fitzgerald, played brilliantly by Hilary Swank. Maggie is a very tough young woman in her early 30's. Some people might call her character ""white trash"" and they wouldn't be too far off of the mark. But that would only describe the superficial aspects of Maggie's character. You quickly come to appreciate Maggie's determination and grit as she hounds Frankie Dunn daily with the request to train and manage her. Frankie wants nothing to do with her initially but slowly is won over by Maggie's personality.As all of this is going on we meet ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, a washed up old boxer and possibly Frankie's only friend. Scrap-Iron helps Frankie run his gym and is won over by Maggie a lot quicker than Frankie is. Scrap-Iron is played by the always great Morgan Freeman. Freeman deserved his Best Supporting Actor award.Frankie agrees to train and manage Maggie and this is when the film really takes off. Frankie is, for reasons never really explained in the movie, estranged from his own daughter. Maggie becomes Frank's surrogate daughter.Maggie starts to rise in the ranks as a boxer. It turns out that she's exceptionally gifted as a boxer. Her relationship with Frankie grows with each fight. There are virtually father and daughter and are fulfilling that emotional role for each other.The movie takes a dramatic turn which I won't reveal in this review. The events only deepen your appreciation for the emotional integrity of all of the main characters.What can I say about the 3 main actors in this film that hasn't already been said? Being a huge Clint Eastwood fan I am immensely satisfied to see him finally getting the respect for both his acting and directing skills from his peers, the critics and the general public. I hope that Clint continues to make films. It's great to go to a movie that is about something, has characters you care about and a real story. Hilary Swank is Maggie Fitzgerald. You never even get the impression that this great actress is acting. She was the Best Actress last year and also deserved her Oscar. I've already made my comments about Morgan Freeman.Hey, everyone in Hollywood...You want to know how to make a great film? Put your mocha lattes down and get a primer lesson on film-making.

A Million Dollar Film,"When going into see Million Dollar Baby, I was expecting a film similar to that of the awesome Rocky saga. I was very surprised by this film that shows the rise and unfortunate end to the career of Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), a waitress suffering from poverty. Swank and supporting actor Morgan Freeman definitely earned their Oscars, and I was happy to see Million Dollar Baby shut down The Aviator for Best Film. Clint Eastwood got the award for director, sorry Scorsese! The only part of this film that kind of disgusted me was watching Clint Eastwood cry. Dirty Harry does not cry! It was the perfect part for Eastwood, but unfortunately for him, Jamie Foxx pulled off a career ice breaker in Ray, leaving him without the little gold guy.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Million Dollar Baby =  Classic,"When Clint directed Mystic River, I was amazed. When Clint directs Mystic River, he leaves me stunned for life. The movie which everyone must of thought is another Rocky movie, is not much about boxing, but about Life and Relationships. Clint reaches for your hear this time around. His direction is just tremendous. I know his Oscar is awaiting. Acting-wise I think this was Clint's best performance. He rips the screen apart in every scene. He can be very humorous at times, and then he can be the total opposite, ""Stubborn-Old-Man"". His plays his role with ease. While best supporting actor award should be reserved for Morgan, cause damn he surely deserves it. He voice, his voice, his voice.There is absolutely no actor like him. He's just too natural. The show -stealer Hilary Swank gives a top notch performance. I know she worked day and night for this role to get in shape and learn boxing, but her role demanded way more than a few punches here n there, and she delivered. And boy did she deliver a ""knock-out"" performance. Screenplay by Paul Haggis is amazing. Editing is crisp. Its a pure classic. A Movie that will make you think for days and days.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
overrated movie which is predictable after the 2nd act.,"I must say that I am really disappointed that this movie got the best picture Oscar. It starts as a promising movie, the opening act is wonderful. Maggie (Hilary Swank) is a young adult woman who is trying to be a professional boxer asking help from an old, experienced boxing coach Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood). Eddie (Morgan Freeman) is Frankie's right-hand and possibly the only one who really understands him. Frankie is haunted by guilt about something happened between him and his daughter in the past and he is reluctant to coach Maggie. But Maggie has been through many hardships and is not a quitter. She is determined to get where she wants and she is willing to do what others are not (actually this is from a sign in the gym they are working out: winners are willing to do what loser are not). Soon enough, she wins Frankie's heart and Frankie finally warms up to the idea of coaching a female boxer. Maggie, in a way, could be thought of as a ""female Rocky"" as she, too, is an underdog, someone who is poor, had many hardships but willing to fight until the end (only, unlike Rocky, it's a she). Then the championship games begin and after the 1st act is over, the movie takes a tumble. From then on, everything is downhill and very predictable. I can honestly say that I knew everything that was going to happen in the last 45 minutes of the movie. I could have walked out the theatre and wouldn't have missed a thing. Because everything that happened in the last act was just predictable. There was no room in the story for any improvement. It's like the plot has been decapacitated. It was very painful to watch. I felt all the buttons that the director was trying to push to activate emotions. They were just too obvious and in our face. Overall, this is not a bad movie but not good enough to win an Oscar.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
'Million Dollar Baby'... Priceless,"Take a film, strip it of special effects, a drop-dead-gorgeous female lead, and a box office-friendly, money-making plot line. Replace with a soul-shaking story, timeless performances, and a bone-shattering punch that comes not in the form of explosions, sex, or gratuitous violence, but in the genius of its direction, writing, and soulful thematic delivery; you get Million Dollar Baby. The film with 'million dollar' integrity and bargain $30 million price tag lands a killer, cinematic punch square in the dignity of films with the $150 million price tag and Dollar Store insignificance.Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), determined, full of heart and empty of pocket enters the boxing gym of the hard-shelled and well-respected trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood). Between her low-paying and hopelessly mundane waitressing job at a local diner, Maggie lands punches at Frankie's gym. Taking little notice to and simply no concern for the ""girl"" who has been so doggedly training in his gym; Frankie is approached by his old friend Eddie 'Scrap-Iron' Dupris (Morgan Freeman), who has seen something in Maggie, not in the force of her blows, but the strength of her heart. Several times Maggie pleads with Frankie to train her and several times he turns her down. That is until, one night, when another shoebox full of un-opened letters returned from his daughter is filled and Frankie must decide to regain the daughter he lost. Finally accepting her offers, Frankie begins to train the scrappy and determined 31 year-old amateur. Having not in her unfortunate life seen a fraction of the love and care given to her by her new trainer, Maggie is bestowed a father figure in the most unlikely of places. Having not had anything to love and care for the longest of times, Frankie is given the daughter he lost so long ago. Fighting and sweating and bleeding, Maggie works her way to the Las Vegas title fight Frankie never participated in. All the way she is loved and grows closer with her trainer and all the way Frankie regains the fire to care for the person behind the gloves, and not just the gloves themselves.Known for his classical and quiet approach to direction, allowing the actors and storyline to carry his films into the annuls of film hierarchy, Clint Eastwood reaches far beyond the industry's wildest expectations and lands a cinematic punch of unparalleled magnitude in this riveting modern classic. Pacing is done to perfection with well-built character development across the ensemble and general calculated patience in the maturity of the story. The viewer is allowed to ease into their seats early in the film so that they may be as comfortable as is possible before the film's enthralling climax. Simple camera movements and framing (a moniker of Eastwood) are utilized without the pretentious and dizzying camera spasms of Stone, Rodriguez and other ostentatious directors. The unadulterated ability, grit, and strength of character Eastwood exudes through the film give it its poignant, numbing effects. Simple, yet ruggedly-elegant cinematography bodes well for the overall might of the picture. Praised by his casts for allowing their ability as actors to speak through their performances and not through their costumes, make-up, or ""punch-lines"" and for his meticulous attention to emotions and not explosions, Eastwood's pioneering directorial integrity are ingrained in every frame of Million Dollar Baby.Morgan Freeman delivers another Oscar-caliber performance as the warm-hearted, one-eyed ex-boxer, Eddie. Emotional presence is exuded into every line in a performance mimicking the timelessness of the role of Red in The Shawshank Redemption (1994). Eastwood's unmistakable grit and emotional veracity in his Oscar-nominated performance is simply unforgettable and brings the driest of eyes to tears. But, out-doing even the thematic valor of Freeman and Eastwood is the simply breathtaking, inspiring, and mind-numbing performance of one, Hilary Swank. In the title role of Maggie Fitzgerald, Swank is immaculate. In a portrayal that can only be characterized as miraculous, Swank brings the audience's eyes to the screen as they watch her struggle to survive, taking half-eaten food from the plates of the customers she waits-on. She brings us to the edge of its seats when she enters the ring. She brings us to cheers and revelry with each bloody, pulse-pounding, jaw-shattering first-round knockout. She brings us all to our knees in her despair after being denied the slightest scrap of gratitude after buying her odious, gold-digging, ingrate of a mother a home with what little money she has earned in her early bouts. She moves our souls, touches our hearts, and reaches to wipe-off our tears in scenes of such moving poignancy, they are simply impossible to describe in words. A flawless, awe-inspiring performance at the apex of thematic capacity.Without giving away Million Dollar Baby's gut-wrenching climax, I must touch-on its jarring inspiration.How valuable is something that is two-of-a-kind? How priceless is something that has happened only once before in over 550 different experiences? It is timeless. It is priceless. Until Million Dollar Baby, I had wept only once before during a film. That prestigious honor went to one of the greatest achievements in the history of the arts, Schindler's List (1993). Accompanying me to the film were two of my closest friends, one of which would cry in Finding Nemo, the other has teared-up in only a small handful of films. One, as to be expected ran out of tissues and had tears cascading down her face long after the film's credits rolled across the screen. The other, doing his very best to fight off the torrent of water building deep in his eyes, could not help but choke on his emotions. I, myself truly wept. With each tear the film was elevated to a higher level. With each falling drop, Million Dollar Baby instilled more in me, the movie-goer and me, the human being. Astounding direction, astonishing integrity, miraculous performances why we go to the movies. An inspiration.9/10",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"A ""million dollar"" waste of your time.","Clint Eastwood starred in, co-produced, directed, and wrote the music for Million Dollar Baby. And the result is typical for actors who direct their movies as well. This is, to put it nicely, a terrible movie. Until the ending, the movie's message seems to be ""you can accomplish anything if you try hard"". And then comes the ending, which destroys any possibilities of a moral from this movie. Eastwood does nothing new, playing his standard, anti-hero, ""tough guy"" role. Morgan Freeman appears in this embarrassing movie, but miraculously, manages not to embarrass himself.

Top rate movie,I am not a fan of boxing movies in any shape or form & only watched this as it was given to me to view on DVD from overseas. I was very surprised at the interest it held from the very beginning. The acting was excellent & the characters fully believable while the story showed the results of determination & dedication. It is easy to see why Hilary won the Oscar for her outstanding performance. Seeing the background from where our heroine evolved adds to the degree of admiration at her determination & will power to succeed in a sport that is very competitive & one that by all reason she has passed the expiry date as she is competing with much younger fighters. The message here is strong also the message of faith in others as she fully believes that only one trainer is going to get her where she knows she is capable of being. People taking chances on others is always open to good interpretation & is very well done in this movie. Although a long movie it is very sad when the story actually ends.

Perfection,"I know perfection is a hard thing to achieve... some may argue that it's impossible... maybe, but this movie is one of the closest things you can get. Eastwood is like a good port wine, or a good scotch whiskey, it get's better as it ages. Far from the cold hard look of it's Dirty Harry or Sergio Leone's westerns, Clint has become a man with a very personal and always emotional view on human relations. From the wonderful Oscar-winning Unforgiven, to the beautiful Bridges of Madison County or the powerful Mystic River, Clint Eastwood always shows us a human story with some unresolved, deep, old wounds from the past that haunt the characters throughout the entire movie. And he is always able to touch the most inner feelings of ourselves. Million Dollar Baby is probably it's most accomplished movie. Great actors, great script and a master's touch make a must see for everyone.

Best Picture - My thoughts exactly,"I told a friend of mine that I would be very disappointed in the Academy if this film didn't win a number of awards.

The ending could have been better, but it didn't prevent me from enjoying the movie very much.The development of MS Swank's character was excellent. We saw her character grow as a person as well as an athlete. I found myself caring whether she did well or not. The addition of the supporting cast used for her family did very well in making her personal values even more amazing.

Imagine Rocky with breasts but no sequels,"On the one hand, Million Dollar Baby is probably the most masterfully acted and beautifully crafted movie of the year, thoroughly deserving all four of its Oscars. But on the other, it lacks the originality and all-round satisfaction provided by fellow nominee Sideways.You know what you're going to get with a Clint-directed film; usually a story of human failings told through rich but moody visuals at an unhurried pace in unsexy locations. When he breaks out of this mould, you get Firefox, The Rookie and Space Cowboys.M$B teams spunky hick chick wannabe-boxer Maggie with grouchy mentor Frank, puts them on the road to success and then runs them off it in an extremely tragic manner. Imagine Rocky with breasts but no sequels.Clint combines power with light-footedness in the gym and in the ring, but some of the dramatic scenes suffer from screenwriter Paul Haggis's leaden, hackneyed dialogue which clumsily telegraphs each of the tragic events to come. But the actors, and Swank in particular, deliver it faultlessly.This is a movie about taking your chance when it comes, living for the moment and having faith in people, not religion (tellingly, the only 'f' word in the film is uttered by a priest). It is a thought-provoking and captivating film of unquestionable quality, but the idea of the working class girl with a boxing dream was realised recently, and perfectly adequately, in Girlfight. Originality is what makes a film great, so in that respect, M$B is a worthy contender rather than a true champion.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Noble, yet flawed effort from Clint Eastwood","From this director I have seen GRAN TORINO and UNFORGIVEN, both of which are exceptional movies, and after both of those tours-de-forces I must admit that my review may be a bit harder than if I had not seen those films. MILLION DOLLAR BABY is indeed quite flawed in many ways. For one thing, I really have no idea why Morgan Freeman is in this, because his character seems to serve no other purpose than being a narrator (which is unfortunately what the man seems to be most famous for these days). However, this is without a doubt a very good, and for one useless supporting character, we have two very well-written main characters.At this point I would usually write some sort of light summary of the plot, but it is very hard to do this for MILLION DOLLAR BABY without giving away a very interesting plot twist. And it is this twist that will either make or ruin the movie for most people. All that one needs to know is that this is about boxing and the will to be the best. Mostly.The main problem with this film is that some of the drama feels clichéd and forced, which is interesting because the film is at its best when its doing exactly the opposite: being unpredictable. The result is a film that feels a little uneven. Nonetheless, this is a satisfying watch.Recommended to people who don't mind depressing dramas.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Captivating Story and amazing handling of characters and issues,"Plot Outline: Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) a veteran boxing trainer runs a dilapidated gym along with friend Scrap (Morgan Freeman), an ex-boxer who lost his eye fighting. Personally Frankie has suffered estrangement from his daughter, and feigns atheism but has been attending mass for the past 23 years.Then Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank), a struggler requests Frankie to train her. Tired after years and with innate fear of seeing someone fatally injured, Frankie shrugs off Maggie. He tells her that she's too old and he doesn't train girls. But Maggie's determination makes Frankie agree, although grudgingly.The two come to discover a common bond that they share and loss of their families long ago.Comment: The screenplay based upon stories from ""Rope Burns"" by FX Toole. The story packs two years of their lives into two hours showing the surrogate father-daughter relationship and personal/professional challenges they undergo.Direction and Acting are simply amazing (4 Oscars prove it). The characterization, plot and handling of touchy issues like euthanasia are neat. This is one movie that reiterates that Hollywood is the mecca for Movies and Superstars!Rating: 4.5/5  Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
The Best Picture of the Year!,"On the outside 'Million Dollar Baby' seems like a boxing picture, but it's really a character study of the three characters involved (played expertly by Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman). Before I saw the film, I thought it was going to be a tacky and sappy girl boxing movie, but it wasn't. I find even after I've seen it, it's hard to convince people the film is not like that, and it's not a conventional formulaic boxing film like Rocky, but that it is something a hell of a lot deeper. After seeing the film for a second time, I found that it really has no weak points other then being a little slow towards the beginning (which was essential in order to tell the story correctly.) Clint Eastwood not only does an outstanding job directing this soon-to-be-classic, but he also produces the film, composes a spellbinding musical score, and gives his very best screen performance as Frankie Dunn, a down-on-his-luck boxing manager who decides to take on a wannabe female boxer. Morgan Freeman provides us with a quiet yet extremely effective performance as Frankie's long-time friend and partner. Not only does Freeman play this part, but his character narrates the story, so the whole movie is told from this character's perspective. The on-screen chemistry between Eastwood and Freeman is too incredible for words, a chemistry that was only once before seen in 1992's Best Picture winner 'Unforgiven', that was also made by Eastwood. The best performance of the film obviously comes from Hilary Swank as the average trailer-trash restaurant waitress who's one true passion is for boxing. Swank delivers a tour-de-force performance, and along with Eastwood it's also her best on-screen acting performance. Ms. Swank knows her character very well, and it shows that she didn't just memorize the lines of the character, but she embodied the character. Overall, when you see the film you don't see the three actors, but the characters they portray. 'Million Dollar Baby' is my choice for Best Picture, along with the Oscars for Best Director, Best Supporting Actor, Best Film Editing and Best Original Score. However I think Hilary Swank shouldn't be awarded Best Actress, that title belongs to Imelda Staunton who gave definitely one of the best female performances I have ever or probably will ever see in my life in Mike Leigh's 'Vera Drake'.

God Bless Clint Eastwood!,"And i don't even believe in God! I think MDL was powerful. It was a movie that moved u without being too dramatic. And thats the beauty of this movie. Hillary Swank is an acting diva. She is one of the best actresses of this era. Clint Eastwood does a lovely job as Frankie.But more importantly he is one helluva director. he deserved not one but two Oscars for it. Morgan freeman is the best actor in the world. He never disappoints. The screenplay is really slow...but thats is to suit the style of film-making. The use of lighting in the movie really helps set the atmosphere required. And the world of boxers and their trainers is portrayed with complete justice.Dialogues are short, crisp and hard hitting.One of the best movies made in the past few years. God Bless Clint Eastwood.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Million Dollar Baby might seem like a formulaic sports film, but its core is full of emotion.","Sweet Jesus this was depressing. Like I'm talking soul destroying. The little tiny bit of happiness and glory is absolutely annihilated by the tragic third act. Just like a typical sports drama, a rookie wishes to become a champion (in this case a female) and so they train, win fights and compete in the title match. Yes, we've seen it all before. It's a formula that just works perfectly for the sports genre, so there is no need to alter it. Yet, Clint Eastwood decided to go that extra step further and throw in a plot twist that was ruined by the film's marketing. That issue aside, it was excellently executed and really does create an impact. This isn't just a story about winning boxing and becoming a champion. It's about pursuing your dreams and battling your own personal demons. Trying to make something out of your life. Two juxtaposing personalities makes this abundantly clear. Frankie Dunn gives people opportunities and strives for perfection whereas Eddie Dupris lives his life in regret for not being able to achieve his life's ambition. Maggie comes along with the pain and loss of her past life and is able to connect with these two experienced yet jaded individuals that transcends their sorrow. Through sheer determination of the sport, they battle on together. Like a family they unfortunately never had. Using the sport of boxing, Eastwood turns a simple plot into a subtextual construct about inspiration. Very touching. All performances were outstanding. Swank, Freeman and Eastwood were phenomenal, could watch them all day. Eastwood's direction was incredible, particularly how he filmed the boxing matches. The shots are far away so that you can see the actors fight, as if it was a real boxing match. Paul Haggis' screenplay was sharp and rather cut throat. Eastwood's lines were quite savage which enhanced how fatigued he was. The third act's tonal shift may steer some away but this is a well crafted and well acted sports drama.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Heartwrenching and reflective movie...,"I had always been curious about this movie because is considered by many among the best movies from 2004, it's the only movie for which Morgan Freeman won the Academy Award and it was directed and acted by Clint Eastwood (who has an amazing track record as both director and actor) so I knew I had to see it! And this movie, other than loving it, it made me reflect a lot.In the first hour and 20 minutes this is a boxing movie. A young woman (Hilary Swank) is determined to become a champion of female boxing. In doing so he begs a traines that has a reputation for training worldwide known champions, Frankie Dunn (Eastwood). Dunn at the beginning is reluctant, but with also some advice by the gym cleaner and best friend Eddie Scrap Iron Dupris (Freeman) he accepts to train her. At first it all goes well and she is recognized as a world champion, and her dream is accomplished. However during one fight she falls in the ring and after hitting her head on the chair she becomes paralyzed and is taken to an hospital... and then the movie becomes better but darkest. It asks the question ''Do we have an innate right to die?'' when we think there is no apparent quality in life. It's an important and ethical question that no one never asks. And I am sure that many viewers after they saw this movie wanted to discuss this subject with the family members or friends. Few movies will make you think like MILLION DOLLAR BABY does... this, combined with great acting and a terrific script, makes for one of the best movies of the decade and it's no surprise it even won the Academy Award for Best Movie.Overall, I think I said a lot about this movie and many said everything that had to be said about it so it will leave it here. A must see to all fans of great movies! And it should be shown also in movie schools.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"...a well-realized movie, but not for everyone...","This movie is sensitive, compassionate, intelligent, touching, and deals with a topical social issue- assisted suicide.The acting is excellent and the direction is more than competent.However the movie is also primarily naturalistic and goes to one of those places I don't find at all appealing in the art I seek out. I believe this kind of subject matter is better dealt with in television documentaries or news stories, not in cinematic art.I realize that many people would disagree. But if you are one of those who don't like to go to a movie to be made to feel pity at a tragic spectacle- then avoid this film.Clint Eastwood has sold out it appears...after being envied and vilified early in his career ( for the spaghetti westerns and Dirty Harry movies )...he has capitulated in stages to the establishment to the point where he has become an establishment icon.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
A truly excellent movie!!,"Clint Eastwood really plays his part in his role great. The movie was great and I will watch it again and again. It is almost like the modern day Rocky movie except with an awful ending. I almost cried at the end, but you all have to realize what you would want if you were in the fighter's situation at the end of the movie. This movie will really make you think about your life and make you realize how fast something bad could happen. Anyway, if you watch the movie, you will understand what I mean. Another thing I didn't like about the movie was Maggie's family. They were so ungrateful that it made me mad and I wasn't even in the movie. Maggie was out there trying to be the best she could be, and they were so ungrateful for the things she was doing to try to help them. I really believe that they were my family, I would have turned my back on them just because of that reason. Either way, I still give this movie a 10 and would give it an 11 if allowed.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Oscar Oscar Oscar !!!!!!!,"From the trailer to the ending, ""Million Dollar Baby"" encompassed everything to deserve an Oscar. Every role was right on and every angle should never be changed for this film to remain PERFECT. Ms. Hillary Swank payed her dues in the ring and I believe that really put her in the mind set of a struggling yet determined older female boxer, which in turn got her her second Oscar. Mr. Morgan Freeman, what can I say but excellent, he never lets me down and always delivers. Mr. Clint Eastwood has made one of the best films of all times with ""Million Dollar Baby"".

It never let me down and should be viewed by anyone who has never seen it and it will surly change their opinion about the best movie of the new millennium.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Review of Million Dollar Baby,"We ordered this movie last night on PPV, and I didn't know anything about it except that it involved boxing and starred Clint Eastwood. While watching the last Oscar Awards, I saw Hillary Swank's acceptance speech and thought it was a bit over the top with emotion. Now I understand why, and I also understand why it's so important to see the nominated films before the awards! I have never seen Ms. Swank in any other movie, but as of today I am a die-hard fan. What a gut-wrenching, heartfelt, sincere performance she gave us! Not to mention her efforts put forth to recreate the physical and conditioning demands of such a role.As for Clint Eastwood, his character holds immense content to create such a beautiful film. He is an inspiration to those of us who may be feeling less 'able' as we age. Although the narrative role of Morgan Freeman's character made me hearken back to 'The Shawshank Redemption', I did not mind the similarity. Like Shawshank, I found great comfort in hearing his voice. It provided some sort of calming reassurance through all the swirling emotions I felt as I watched this film.I urge everyone who loves films to see this one and to tell everyone you know to see it as well.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Heart-Warming, Amazing and very Thought Provoking","Not knowing anything about the film before watching it, I was amazed and taken aback by what seemed a ""by the numbers"" sporting drama was done.Morgan Freeman's narration, and 2 of the most moving performances by Clint Eastwood and Hilary Swank all add up to a moving masterpiece that should live on for many years, and left me wanting more, yet glad that it ended when it did.Within the space of 2 hours you see each character transform and ""grow"" as actions, decisions and consequences affect the life they lead. Comparable to Shawshank Redemption in terms of the mood of the film, the cinematography and the uplifting feeling, only good can come from watching this film and I urge you all to see it.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
This won movie of the year?????,"Unbelievable that this type of movie would win so many awards. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. The content was as depressing as depressing can get. And many parts of the movie were UNREAL; they didn't ring true. It was contrived dialogue and inappropriate emotions.Let's start with boxing. Boxing is a brutal sport and how anyone can get excited about people knocking the crap out of each other and risking serious injury is beyond me.Then the entire second part of the movie was about the fallen champ becoming a bedridden vegetable. Depressing all the way to the end! Of course, Clint wants to help her out of sheer guilt. So he somehow forces himself to pull the plug despite any legal consequences and despite the fact she IS conscious. Unreal. Didn't buy it for a minute.I also didn't buy her family. There are redneck hillbillies and then there are just people with absolutely no moral fibre, good judgment or sensitivity in their body. Her ENTIRE family was the latter. Nobody's entire family is that bad.Piece of contrived, depressing art is all this movie was. And I like Clint. My friend's Irish old dad is a dead ringer for him.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
formulaic and self-indulgent,"While this comment goes against the tide of popular opinion, I believe that ""Million Dollar Baby"" is tediously self-indulgent and formulaic. From the opening moments of this overly-long, predictable movie, the audience is presented with one clichéd situation after another - in fact towards the end of the film, one can practically see the kitchen sink descending! Many of the characters are nothing more than stereotypes - particularly the boxer's trashy and unscrupulous family.Swank's acting skills cannot be faulted, but one becomes very tired of Eastwood's deeply soulful gazes, as he metamorphoses from an impatient curmudgeon, reluctant to undertake the training of a ""girlie"" boxer to a deeply caring father-figure.None of the characters is explored in depth. Instead we have hackneyed situations, inducing a strong sense of deja vu. Haven't we encountered these themes and these character types in one form or another before? Morgan Freeman is an extremely capable actor, but hasn't he assumed a similar persona in many other films? ""Shawshank Redemption"" comes to mind, for a start.I realize that ""Million Dollar Baby"" will have much popular appeal, since the film demands no challenging cerebral activity from its viewers, but instead shamelessly manipulates their emotions. For my part, I found the movie to be a nauseating concoction of schmaltz, political correctness and predictability.",3.0,Anonymous,Drama
Rare glimpse into the goodness of mankind,"I can tell you that seeing the goodness of mankind in a movie these days is so rare. In this movie, you see raw passion that is not driven by revenge or anger. The characters are so believable and real - you feel like you want to know more and more. The story was simple, but the emotional tones were complex and interesting. Clint Eastwood has a unique talent in showing an audience kindness and sincerity in a person's character without making them look or appear meek or mild. I took away a refreshed hope and relished in the wholesome quality of his artistry. So many people heralded this movie as a ""best yet"" or ""movie of the year"", but it surpasses these statements as a BEST EVER. I am so thankful Eastwood took a rather unattractive story line (woman boxer) and made it a legend!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Best cliché you'll see for sometime,"This film has received criticism for its use of clichés; and the clichés are here, and they are plentiful. But the production, direction, and acting breathe life into them to the extent that most of them are unnoticeable, and a few are even welcome. Morgan Freeman's character is pure formula, but to the extent that he is an excellent actor, who cares? and to the extent that this IS a ""boxing"" movie, where would it be without such a retired ""old-school"" boxer (punched-out eye and all) to comment on the nature of the sport? The fact is, the construction is so well-done that it is hard not to watch the film all the way through. And the main characters are, on the whole, very likable; we care about them.A well-made, memorable presentation, even if we have seen these elements before.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Eastwood has made another great and touching movie,"Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) is an old boxer, trainer, and sometimes manager who owns a boxing gym. Frankie has trained and managed a boxer for the last 8 years to a title fight, but he says he needs some more work, before he goes for the title. Frankie has been overprotecting his fighter, because he had a problem with another title fight many years earlier. The fighter drops Frankie and gets another manager. Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank) an untrained 31-year old fighter wants Frankie to train her, but Frankie tells her that she is too old and he doesn't train girls. Maggie begins to train on her own. Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman), an old boxer who lives in and looks after Frankie's gym, gives Maggie some tips on hitting the bag. Frankie wants Maggie out of his gym until he finds out that she has paid 6-months of gym dues in advance. Maggie trains day after day and finally gets under Frankie's skin. Frankie agrees to train Maggie, but she must follow his number-one rule, protect yourself at all times. Maggie begins to win fight after fight, and after 1-½ years, Maggie gets a title fight in Las Vegas for a share of a million dollar purse. Clint Eastwood not only stared in this movie, but also directed, produced, and wrote the music. The movie shows the determination a woman must have to fight her way into the male dominated world of professional boxing. Hillary Swank will surely be nominated for an Academy Award. The movie also shows the friendship and sense of family that is formed between a trainer and his fighter. You may shed a few tears at the end of the movie.

a fine new addition to an American tradition in film-making,"Since the days of silent film and pioneer filmmakers such as DW Griffith, and the days of the Western and its main contenders like John Ford, and through the time of the gangster films of Raoul Walsh and the like, and until today, there has been a tradition in American film, a tradition of film-making and storytelling that chronicles the great struggle for self-fulfillment and achievement. In ""Million Dollar Baby"", we have a grand return to this form by Clint Eastwood, one of the quintessentially American filmmakers still working today. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is by no means a virtuoso film, or innovative in its use of the camera or cutting. Here is a film that sticks to tried and true methods such as continuity cutting, smooth tracking shots, and atmospherically centered and balanced mise-en-scene. The film establishes a true sense of place in the boxing ring, the gym, and the hospital. The camera takes us through the world revealing to us the truth of things rather than telling us the truth of things. The characters play out their interactions thus without stylistic interference. Indeed, Eastwood has mastered the Hollywood style. He has stripped it of all its commercial coverings, and shown us what American film-making is really all about: honesty. A character study of enormous depth that plays out in a tried and true narrative, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is not a hard nut to crack. It is a film about finding peace with oneself, about the generosity and determination of the human spirit. It is a film about the battles each of us fights but that no one likes to talk about. A great movie, it is about hope and redemption in the end. I was profoundly moved.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Not Just Boxing,"For those people who do not like boxing (such as me) take heart. It might not matter. In my opinion this movie transcends boxing, just as the movie Sea Biscuit was not just a horse race movie.I have heard it said that when Clint Eastwood directs a film and is also a star in it, it will be a notch above most in seriousness and overall quality. Having added this one more Clint Eastwood picture to my viewing experience I have to agree. Clint Eastwood is definitely an interesting person. With no one to direct him but himself, he turns in a fabulous performance as an actor in this movie. Perhaps due to casting, perhaps due to Eastwood's direction and perhaps due to both, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman also deliver acting performances that were among the best I have seen anywhere. With this realistic acting, serious direction, and an interesting story line, Million Dollar Baby is easily one of the most powerful movies I can recall seeing in recent years. Powerful is the correct word. With both exceptional and yet believable roles played by Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman, and Clint Eastwood himself, one can easily get lost into the movie themselves seeing it through one of their eyes, and thus almost become a part of the film itself.I know that some will try to typecast this movie and pigeonhole it as a certain type. Some will call it a boxing movie. Some will say it is a pro euthanasia movie. Now, I also believe that I am a moral person. However, to typecast this movie as simply as either of those I believe is to be unfair to Eastwood. Eastwood does not take the subject of boxing too seriously, and yet he more than does enough to render the subject of life and death itself a most serious matter in this movie also. In fact, after watching this movie, one wonders if Clint Eastwood is capable of being ""casual"" about anything. Clint Eastwood is a serious director, a serious actor, and a serious man.I highly recommend watching this movie. However I would also caution what I say is its most important point - that of being a powerful movie. By powerful movie you may, as I was, become drawn deep into the movie and the story. When that happens you might want to cheer at the times when it has good news, and be very sad during the movie sad parts. That is what I believe powerful means.I recommend this movie and am personally looking forward to the next Clint Eastwood production.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Highly respected actors,"I did not know a lot about this movie until I had actually seen it. I knew it starred Eastwood and Freeman and that it had won many Oscars. Boy, was excited. Then it hit me - what a brilliant movie! From its first minutes to the very last scene I was stunned.The narrator is, and may I say 'of course', Mr. Morgan Freeman - one of my favorite actors. He has an excellent voice does a very good job as the narrator as well as the former boxer Eddie. 'Million Dollar Baby' is directed by Mr. Clint Eastwood I haven't seen any of his movies before so to me, this was a nice experience.'Million Dollar Baby' is a touching story and very well-done which makes it to one of the best movies of this decade.

Good story telling technique but script is lackluster compared to everything else.,"Million Dollar Baby is a very good film. If I were to make a top ten, it would be on there but not before probably 4-6 films. This is not Clint Eastwood's best directorial job. It is however his best performance as an actor and in my mind, deserved more recognition than just a nomination. Swank and Freeman are both very good but in my opinion they fall short of Eastwood's performance. Most critics and industry people are jaded because they form relationships with these people and root for them and that taints the accuracy of reviews and nomination processes Freeman won this year because he should have won a long time ago for either Driving Miss Daisy or Shawshank Redemption, whereas this year the actual best performance in that category was clearly Thomas Haden Church. Swank won because she was in the best movie at the best release time. If Eternal Sunshine for the Spotless Mind was more popular and was released after Halloween, Kate Winslet would be billed everywhere in every magazine as the next Meryl. I think what makes this film fall short of being an immortal piece of work is the script. It's good, like everything else in the movie (except maybe cinematography, but that's being very picky). However, Haggis' script is not insightful enough. There is too much responsibility on the actor's side to give us insight into the suffering all of them have suffered and are suffering. That is why I feel Eastwood's performance is the best in the entire film. He tells us everything that has gone on in his life with just his look and voice. Freeman and Swank give us some indication but not to the depth. Had Haggis provided more insight into the struggles of Scrap and the drama between Maggie and her family or a deeper relationship exploration between her and Frankie, this would have moved me deeper and placed it among the great American movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Million Dollar Tears from this one,"This is without a doubt Eastwood's best ever movie. From start to finish we see how one man can and will be able to make a difference in someone's life when they need them the most. As a martial artist I've always believed that the teacher appears when the student is ready, and never is this more apparent than with Swank's character.I related to her in this, as I saw her family issues arise from her career success and the jealousy which can go with it. I also have to say it gives me tears every time I've watched it, and I simply refuse to see the end of it anymore. Its that good, its that powerful.So if you're looking for a good movie, no, make that an awesome one, this is one to get. I rank it up there with The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile.

Good but not excellent,"The film leaves many mixed feelings and emotions. First, the actors' play is always very good. Marty Freeman, Clint Eastwood and of course Hillary Swank are in all senses excellent actors, their delivery is impeccably smooth and almost close to perfection. It is not the acting that spoils the mood, it is the very tedious tempo of the film. Did you notice that sport films are mostly very boring? The acute, high-pitched and up-tempo sport scenes are intermittent with impossibly slow and boring ""real life"" moments, when we see that they are also people, that they have their problems too and so on. But, dear me, I always wait till these boring moments will be replaced with those sharp sporty scenes again. The same with MDB - as a sport film, this is great, as anything else, it is slightly slowish and boring.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Disappointment: Ruined by Bad Ending,"I'll avoid spoilers at the beginning of this review. MDB was well-acted and directed and had me interested in the story up until the ""twist,"" which took the film in a different direction for the final 45 minutes.An important element in a good film is being able to make the viewer care about and sympathize with the protagonists. MDB lost me and I stopped caring about the main characters because of some of the decisions that they made near the end of the film. MDB tries to be a drama, but a number of unrealistic scenes make it play more like a melodramatic comic book. One scene, in particular, involving Morgan Freeman, is laughable in its lack of believability. In the end, the film comes off as being preachy. Out of the blue, it tackles a controversial societal topic and tries to force its point of view upon the audience. In doing so, it betrays the integrity of the film and ruins everything good that had built up to that point. The last half hour was torturous to watch and just dragged on at a needlessly slow pace.***SPOILERS BELOW*** I get the feeling that the intention of MDB was to make a case for euthanasia all along and just use the boxing story as a disguise. I strongly disagree with the message of the film: that it is better to die as a championship boxer than to live a life in a wheelchair. The film is a slap in the face to all those who have achieved great things after paralysis, such as Christopher Reeve. Maggie could have used her celebrity status to go on to do great things and raise money and awareness for her condition, as Reeve did. Instead, she makes a terrible decision. I am truly baffled as to why some people applaud the films ending or are emotionally moved by Maggie's death.On a final note, I am not against euthanasia, per se. I think it depends on the situation. For example, in ""One Flew Over the Cookoo's Nest,"" I was deeply moved when the Chief took Jack's life at the end, and I agreed with the decision. This was a case of someone who had a lobotomy and had his personality robbed of him. Maggie, on the other hand, had her personality and intellect still in tact, which is more important than her body.***END SPOILERS***",3.0,Anonymous,Drama

Pure Genius,"This is not so much a review of just the excellence of the film but also of the DVD extras that come if you purchase the DVD special edition.Not only is Million Dollar Baby one of the greats of film, the DVD extras disc is one of the best extras discs which I have seen. Why? Well unlike Peter Jackson's ""Rings"" epic's extra features, the extras with this DVD don't seek the average moviegoer to understand the concept of storyboarding, nor to be interested in the minutiae of film making. As meritorious as the compilers of the ""Rings"" DVDs may have been, they could learn much from those who compiled Million Dollar Baby's extras video. We see interviews with not only the major performers in the cast (Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank) but also other segments feature the minor but quite influential characters and one other segment features the producer and also the writer of the screenplay.The film itself? Absolute brilliance. I first loved Eastwood's direction in a passionate sense after seeing Unforgiven. Gone are the panoramic shots which were characteristic of Unforgiven and The Bridges of Madison County. The camera adopts the claustrophobia of the gym and the hospital ward for much of this film and it succeeds wonderfully. Here is a film that well and truly deserved the Academy Awards which it secured. The plot? Why bother?

An absolutely excellent example of filmcraft . . . engaging on so many levels,"This film really surprised me, in that I am not a ""boxing movie"" type at all, not even remotely, and in general not particularly interested in the sports / boxing saga type of genre'.But in this piece, the character development, the way that the various threads of lives and story are woven together into a compelling tapestry is well crafted, and performed.The entire piece completely transcends the usual sort of cliché' components that are so typical in other such films of the genre'.Of course, I must confess that I could watch Hillary Swank in almost anything, but here she really delivers a performance that may be her best yet . . . and I've seen almost all of her work.Clint Eastwood really has matured as a talented director, which was the other major surprising aspect of this film.The pieces of the puzzle fit together perfectly as the story becomes evermore detailed, the background of her family history and the strange (but highly believable) collection of characters in that family, and of course, Clint's character as the father searching for an answer, a resolution to a seemingly impossible personal quest.There are no weak links or dull moments in any of this, but the ending is . . . difficult to accept, not because of a lack of credibility, but rather for the exact opposite reason, in that the hard edge of life's challenges do indeed become manifest in their own unexpected ways.No clues beyond that will be offered here, though I will offer one parting thought for consideration.This is one of those films that I can (and have) watch time and again, and still discover an engaging experience every time.Rarely do I suggest a rating of 10, for any genre' of film, but in this case, I do so without the slightest hesitation.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Tries too hard to be both drama and comedy,"I have really enjoyed a few of the movies that Clint Eastwood has directed, but this was not one of them.The story overall was quite good, and could have presented the viewer with an interesting and involving story. Instead what I found was characters that did not seem real and a plot progression that didn't feel right. It was the details that didn't work for me. A few words and a few scenes here and there that just yanked me away from the movie, leaving me feeling no attachment at all to the characters.I think that they went all out in the many comedic scenes, so that once they put those same characters into serious scenes, it felt like an adaptation of a comic book -- not very believable. I kept on thinking of the scenes in the first Spider-Man movie when he went to that fight, not very real, but fun to watch. I enjoyed the comedic and action side of Million Dollary Baby, but it left the dramatic side feeling pretty distant and surreal.Surprisingly, I found my favourite character in the movie was not either of the two leads, but the secondary character ""Scraps"", who was played by Morgan Freeman. He felt far more real and believable than the others in this film.My rating of this movie is 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Greatest Film Sine ""Shawshank""","I myself am currently a film school student so to measure the quality of a film is much more complicated considering the things we learn to take into account. (Which characters have arcs, who's the mentor, who's the weight-and-mass character, where and when is the second act turning point, etc.) In the 22 years I have been in existence there was until recently only one utterly flawless film in existences and that was ""The Shawshank Redemption"".But now this gem of a film must serve alongside the blatant brilliance of ""Million Dollar Baby"". Unlike most film enthusiasts I did not have the highest expectations of this film seeing as how I was not that big a fan of ""Mystic River"" so when my buddy convinced me to go I was skeptical. Fifteen minutes in I knew if the film just kept it bearings the result would be metaphorically orgasmic. Everyone from Morgan Freeman to Hilary Swank and Jay Baruchel played the emotionally draining script to a pristine glimmer.This film is undoubtedly the best film of the year and one of the best I've seen in my entire life.

And because its anyone's story, its stellar. Hillary Swank and Clint Eastwood are at there believable best. Morgan Freeman ""supports"" the story, Swank, and Eastwood with subtle finesse.

Now I see what all the fuss is about...,"I never doubted this movie was good, but I was eager to find out why it was good. And I was, of course, curious about the ""plot twist"" everyone was talking about.This is an incredible little movie. Keep in mind that it is ""little,"" because with all the awards this movie has taken home already, some might be fooled into thinking it is more than that. But hey, little is good.If you don't know already what the story is about, I'll give you a brief synopsis. Ageing, haunted Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) owns an old boxing gym. He is so full of guilt over his estranged daughter, Katie, whom he hasn't seen in years, and who refuses to read his letters, that he goes to mass every day. It's starting to get on the nerves of his priest. His only friend is Scrap (Morgan Freeman), a former fighter who watches over the place for Frankie, and keeps people in line.Frankie has a good fighter he's managing, but he doesn't like risks. He's holding him back from a title shot. His fighter likes Frankie, but he wants his shot at the title. He realizes if he's going to get anywhere, he needs to look elsewhere. Simultaneously, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank), a white-trash waitress from Missouri, wants to learn how to fight. Frankie won't train her, until he realizes her potential, and is egged on by Scrap. That's as much detail as should probably be revealed.The movie is almost entirely shot in underexposed film, giving it a dark, washed-out look that complements the boxing theme. It's like the entire movie takes place in a boxing ring, and that's where the lighting and colors are most alive. Eastwood has made a superb follow-up to his masterpiece of scarred Bostonians, ""Mystic River."" Like that film, this one has a strong undercurrent of Irish heritage and Catholicism. Frankie reads Gallic in his spare time, and even gives Maggie a nickname in the language. The detail given to the environment is also very similar. While in ""Mystic River"" everything seemed cold and stark, here it's just dark and claustrophobic. This is a smaller movie, but it is just as good.And everyone in the movie gives first-rate performances. Hilary Swank has tapped into that same great ability that won her the Oscar for ""Boys Don't Cry."" I have always liked Morgan Freeman, and a lot of other people have, too, I know, but after a number of relative duds, he's reminded me why he's such a good actor. And finally, the real treat is Clint Eastwood. Some people may have written him off as a man who can't really act much. But either way, he's almost always played the same tough, hard-edged characters, people who at some point or other are willing to take a stand. Here, that persona, his persona, is not even there. Here, he is a man who has been falling apart for some time, and has payed the price for holding people back. But he unfolds into a man of compassion, who just wishes he could have the chance to fix his mistakes in life. The fact that he's seventy-four and looks it only helps in conveying his inner demons.This I know is not a movie for people who don't like to watch boxing movies. I don't like boxing, but movie depictions can be good. There are some bits of dry humor in the movie, and some that even take place inside the ring. The movie is also very heartrending. If you don't care for deeply emotional movies, don't watch it. But I personally give it a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
This movie elicits every emotion imaginable,"This movie is definitely not a sugar coated portrayal of the sport, this script does not hold back! The characters are very well developed and Hillary Swank delivers an amazing performance. The movie goes much deeper than just the sport itself. It's a story in which each character posses their own inadequacies which they must learn to overcome. The boxing aspect simply symbolizes each individuals struggle to fight their way to the top and learning to ""roll with the punches"". Hillary Swank's character becomes the inspiration that seems to have been lost somewhere along the way. An excellent example of how what we put into the ""fight"" is more important than the outcome.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
What an excellent directing!!!,"Clint Eastwood is better than ever in front of the camera and behind the camera. The start of this movie was marvelous, short sentences, the atmosphere, and the storyteller, his voice was like straight from your favorite grandfather. this story is a different story and a brave movie from Clint Eastwood. There was two different thing in this movie (from my eye). The first was that dirty boxing box, the dark boxing gym and that little word-fight between old veterans, with a beautiful music. The second was the nights and days in hospital, with no sound but the sound of machines around poor Maggie. I admire the attitude of Maggie Fitzgerald. And I admire that Frankie Dunn was ready to put poison in that little girl's vein, which he really admired, I think most (after that girl he fell in love years ago) of his long-lasting life. I thank him, Hilary Swank and my favorite grandfather Morgan Freeman!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Elements of movie-making shine in this film,"This is an almost flawless movie (other than needless profanity from a Catholic priest). Extremely poignant for a movie centered on the boxing world, this movie is a female Rocky for the 2000s.Of course, it is more multi-dimensional as it takes a hard look from not only the boxer's vantage point, but also that of the trainer-manager, too. The intricacies of the protoypical father-daughter relationship -- and the inferred protectionist attitudes therein -- are juxtaposed with the hard-knock, gritty world of female boxing.The twist at the end is surprising. The movie may end a bit too abruptly, but it makes one think. It has a strong moral play that goes beyond the bounds of boxing, and raises questions of utility for those possibly discard by the rest of society. I can't say any more or this will be a spoiler.Almost all of the elements of movie-making shine in this film. None more so than direction and acting. Truly artistry at every turn.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Clint Éastwood gives a fine, moving performance, much different from his western movies and Hillary Swank's portrayal of a women in a mans world came off very real and believable.I really like Morgan Freeman, he always seems to play down to earth, unpretentious characters and he gives a great performance in this movie.

This is just Hollywood sentimental rubbish.,"Million Dollar Baby does not solve any questions it presents. I can't believe it's in the top 250.OK, where shall I begin? Well, for a start, it was incredibly predictable. Clint Eastwood plays one of the most clichéd characters ever. He's a tough man with a heart of gold. John Wayne anyone? Also, Hilary Swank was garbage in it. She was so wooden, and I didn't believe for a second she was a remotely good boxer. I hated it how she got all the good scenes instead of Morgan Freeman who was the only good thing about this film.Paul Haggis is perhaps the most overrated writer in recent times. He uses such formulaic dialogue, it makes a Tarantino fan like myself vomit feverishly when I hear a line like ""You're all I've got."" There are tons of other examples but I can't remember them because I was so bored.Also, it tries to do too much. It tries to deal with the father daughter relationship, Rednecks, euthanasia, how you have to take chances, how you shouldn't gamble etc. Never heard those issues being discussed before have we lades and gents? Especially not in one film. I can imagine Haggis at his typewriter thinking ""How can I spread the plague of my crap TV writing to the wider audience? I know, I'll try to make a boxing movie, WITH A DIFFERENCE!! I'll deal with tons of issues to win the critics over."" Sadly Paul, I'm not fooled.I admit, the cinematography was good in the car scene where the light moves and you can't see their faces and stuff but this light dark thing didn't work for a lot of the film. There were countless scenes where a character stood with their head in darkness. That's not an overused technique is it? And the ending, oh God the ending was abysmal. For those who haven't seen it, let me just let you know it is predictable the second she gets knocked out by a one dimensional East German evildoer. Ahhhhh! I hate characters like that boxer. They don't exist in the real world and how the hell is she world champion? She would get disqualified for breaking the rules obviously. It's such a cop out from the idiot that is Paul Haggis of making poor innocent Hilary, who has just knocked like 20 people out with one punch (realistic huh?), get knocked out by a cheating communist bitch.If only Pauline Kael was still alive and writing. I am certain she would have shown this film for what it is, sentimental garbage. She is famous for hating unrealistic idealism and that is exactly what this appallingly overrated film is about.

"A true MASTERPIECE.  Not really about boxing, but more about relationships.","Mesmerizing -- Ebert is right -- a real Masterpiece. Eastwood is at the top of his game.

He doesn't have to ""eat the scenery"" and carry on like some other so-called great actors. Morgan Freeman as always gives a fabulous performance. But it is Hillary Swank who owns this movie. She is clearly the best actress of our day, and if she doesn't win as Best Actress for her performance then I have to wonder about the Academy members who voted.

Terrific Movie,"I don't know if I can write a review on this. There are 83 pages of reviews  many of them good. Many are fair in both their praise and reservations. I found the details wonderful in both their simplicity and effect.The film starts like something done as a film noir. In fact, Million Dollar Baby would have been an ideal candidate for black and white.After winning a particularly brutal fight, Frankie Dunne's (Clint Eastwood) championship caliber boxer begs a favor. He asks Frankie to go get his wife's car back, which Frankie does. The boxer comes to thank Frankie, (we think, but there is hesitancy). He wants another manager and he leaves Frankie. Though it turns out to be a good move for the younger man professionally, it shows him to be rather thankless and ruthless. Certainly Frankie is not part of his family: he owes Frankie nothing. We don't see any loyalty and gratitude: just a cold business relationship.Though there is no evidence in the film to suggest it, I think that explains why he so hesitant to take on Maggie. He spent eight years with the other fighter and he thinks he will have to spend another 4 on Maggie. It's too much. He's tired. He just wants to go to church write his weekly letters and banter with Scrape. We see Frankie begging for the easy way.Perhaps that is why Scrape (Morgan Freeman) keeps needling him. He wants Frankie to try again. He sees something in Maggie and he instinctively knows she will be good for Frankie. Frankie doesn't know. He's a devout Catholic (about which his priest is almost totally opaque): he doubts he can stand the guilt of the failure of yet one more relationship.The priest in the first scene is totally unsympathetic (or seems so). He asks Frankie if has written his daughter. Frankie tells him every week. We are led to believe that the priest does not believe him. It is a brutal miscalculation from the church's representative. Frankie is used to that: he deals with brutality daily. Why should the church be any different than the rest of his life? These details are foreshadows of what will come.What Frankie finds in Maggie is a woman trusts her feelings. Probably the best part in the movie is the diner scene where Scrape tells us why he never had fight 110. Much has been said about this scene. (The best description is in Roger Ebert's review. Check it out). Maggie learns why Frankie is such a good manager. Maggie knows class when she hears it and she knows life poetry when it's spoken to her. Another manager? Not on her life.There is nothing but love and loyalty in this girl. Contrast Frankie as a father with her actual mother. Maggie does everything a daughter should and her mother insists on treating her as a ten year old who has to be corrected. But Maggie knows some things and tries to be a kind loving adult daughter only to be reprimanded by a fool and a course lazy lout of a mother. It is no wonder she loves Frankie. He was the parent she never really had.Now we come to the real spoiler. We find out that Frankie really has written his daughter once a week. He has kept all his letters (which were returned unread and unopened).After a terrible event in the ring, Maggie has her neck broken. She is a vegetable compared to the way she was. She is not sorry. There are no heroics in any of her statements. She tells him that she has heard the crowds and she does not want the voices to go away. She wants to die. She wants him to help her. In her mind, she is the same as a crippled dog she had as a child. The dog finally had to be put down by her father.He is horrified. He cannot do such a thing.He goes to the priest. He is completely torn apart. Not even his daughter had this effect on him. His tears are those of someone in the deepest anguish.He knows she's right. This was a girl who was nearly a champion athlete who now is not only confined to a bed but who can only be put in a wheel chair after hours of effort.Perhaps because I'm not Catholic, I find the priest's attitude almost incomprehensible. He does not seem to be able to think outside the box. He gives Frankie the standard position about taking life and threatens alienation from the church and with it eternal damnation (the latter implied from the former). The priest does not truly see the problem and Frankie in tears, knows it.Maggie will not accept life that is really a prolonged death and tries to commit suicide by biting her tongue. It is then that Frankie knows what he has to do. It is the tenderest scene in the move. It is so touching that no one with feelings can avoid registering the over powering human conflicts that take only minutes to show. It is one of the great love scenes ever made. Who knew that Dirty Harry had it in him? In the end we are left with Scrape who tries to explain to Frankie's daughter the nature of the man she has stubbornly refused to have anything to do with. She is making a terrible mistake in not acknowledging him. Scrape does it not for Frankie. He does it for her.If there are people who thought this was an OK movie, they either did not see the one I did, or they can't feel. It is the summary of a man's life and it has nothing to do with occupation. It has to do with value.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Clint Eastwood does enough to convince me to somehow get all his other movies and watch them.However, the ending could've been a bit better, which is the reason for the missing star.

A Knockout for Clint,"Forty years ago, Clint Eastwood was immersed in a trio of spaghetti westerns. Fifteen years later he was playing second banana to an orangutan named Clyde. Somewhere between the 1970s and turning 70, Mr. Eastwood became one hell of a director. Unforgiven landed him multiple Oscars, while Mystic River brought him some of the best reviews of his film-making career. The recent release of Million Dollar Baby has given even his most ardent doubters pause, displaying his continuously expanding talents before and behind the camera.Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) is an aging boxing trainer whose modest gym acts as a second home to a ragtag crew of wannabes and runaways. His one genuinely gifted fighter leaves him shortly before hitting it big, citing Dunn's over-protective nature as the reason for his departure. Dunn's fears reach an all-time high when he finally agrees to train newcomer Maggie (Hilary Swank), despite an aversion to coaching women. Her persistence and stubbornness eventually wear him down. As expected, she proves herself a natural, overcoming every opponent in her path.Swank's performance as the loyal, scrappy underdog cements her status as one of the great actresses of her generation. Eastwood's surprisingly emotional performance is a far cry from the one-dimensional, deadpan delivery he made chic decades ago. The story itself unfolds in unexpected ways, but its simple honesty is what truly sets it apart from many of today's flashier, self-important films. A few missteps aside, this is easily one of 2004's best efforts. Don't miss it.Rating: A-",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Predictably enough, those same people thought that after he directed Mystic River. Wrong again. Eastwood slams another one home with Million Dollar Baby, the movie that took home the gold for all those concerned with the picture. Hillary Swank's stock just keeps going up and up she should be listed on NASDAQ. Freeman is stunning as ever with his performance and narration and let's not forget Eastwood. Eastwood hasn't shown that wide a range of acting ever. For the first time in my life I felt truly connected to one of his characters.

I Don't Get The Hype,"Very good film, but hardly ""the masterpiece"" described by Roger Ebert. It is basically a very well done Hallmark Hall of Fame TV Movie. It has Clint Eastwood as a lovable curmudgeon with a heart of gold. Hillary Swank, who is terrific, plays a strong-willed survivor with a heart of gold. Morgan Freeman is cast in his usual role of a wise, quiet observer with a heart of gold. All this becomes ultimately too cloying. Perhaps I expected more because so much was written about it.

The cinematography, camera movement and Eastwood's choice of lighting and sound (or lack of) was right for the movie's subject matter and tone. the silence in the film carries with it a lot of meaning and creates a space where the viewer can pull back from the movie for a second to reflect on the character's feelings and thoughts which gives the movie a lot of depth.

It deserved every award it got...,"I was reminded of a great observation I'd once read about film acting when I was watching Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby."" I believe Roger Ebert said(I could be mistaken there), in an analysis of great film actors, that Marlon Brando showed us all everything that could be brought to a film performance, that Paul Newman learned that from Brando, and then went on to learn what could be left out. Clint Eastwood learned from a lot of great directors in his days as one of the greatest movie stars in the world, and he's become one of the greatest directors we have, because he's confident enough, and disciplined enough, to know exactly what he needs to show you, so that you understand why the characters have made the choices they've made.Million Dollar Baby is one of the two best films Eastwood has given us(his other Best Picture winner, ""Unforgiven"" would be the other one), and it's superb because every single scene, every single line, builds on the one before it. It's a masterpiece of story-telling economy(all the more miraculous because Eastwood shot Paul Haggis' first draft of the script) that pulls you in to the classic story of an underdog boxer that gets a shot at the big time only to then break your heart without ever taking a false or cheap step. This movie doesn't depend on a twist-- the ending is where this story was heading the entire time. It's just that the writer, the director, and the actors(Eastwood, Hilary Swank, and Morgan Freeman, all perfectly cast and at the top of their game) have too much story-telling integrity to let you ever get ahead of them.It's simple, it's powerful, it's honest, and it's heartbreaking.

Heartwrenchingly powerful...it's a movie that nearly anyone can relate to and enjoy,"'Million Dollar Baby' was the first Oscar winning screenplay written by Paul Haggis (Crash). Directed by film legend Clint Eastwood, MDB is nearly perfect in every aspect of film making. When you see this, the acting of Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and especially Hilary Swank will leave you moved. Deserving of all the accolades it received, MDB is not only the best picture of 2004, but one of the best in history.Frankie (Eastwood) is a very hardworking and talented boxing trainer, getting the most out of his fighters, even if their talent isn't Ali or Louis caliber. His most talented fighter has just left him (you see this in the movie) for more money, but is very sad he has to do so, and thanks Frankie by saying that he taught him all he would ever need to know. Then, one day, Frankie and his custodian (Freeman, who lives in the boxing gym) notice a young woman (Swank), Maggie Fitzgerald, punching a bag like clockwork every day. Frankie is at first annoyed by the upstart lady, rapidly declining her request that he train her. Over time, when Maggie tells her story of poverty, financial struggle, and desire to become a champion to Frankie, he reluctantly agrees to train her until she finds a manager. After Frankie decides to fully train and manage her, we see Maggie's success skyrocket. What ensues are some pretty intense boxing scenes. Also what begins is a fantastically acted father-daughter relationship between Frankie and Maggie.We begin to see Maggie's success and popularity soar, and we get more insight into her life, especially her troubled past, consisting of a neglecting mother who we will grow to hate. Swank's performance as Maggie is so good that you will love Maggie so much for her determination to becoming a champion and her kick-ass approach in the ring. All the while, we get a preview of Maggie's ultimate opponent, a ruthless and dirty fighter, a fight which will scare the squeamish. It is hard to go on further without spoiling the plot, which I will not do.The best acting of the movie comes after Maggie's big fight, and it is the reason the movie won so many awards. Eastwood's portrayal of Frankie's inner-struggle in life because of boxing over the years is just great. If not for Jamie Foxx's brilliant portrayal of Ray Charles, Eastwood would've won the Best Actor Oscar last year. Hilary Swank delivers one of the best performances in history as the chipper and lovable Maggie, and Morgan Freeman, while I have not mentioned him too much in this review, is once again great as usual. He is Frankie's right hand man, adviser, and best friend. What you'll notice is that each character will have a scene that defines their performance. Eastwood's is the last scene of the movie, Freeman's is in the middle-end of the movie when he is cleaning something, and Swank's is virtually every scene she is in. That's how good she is.As I said before, it's really hard to review this movie without giving away plot details, and while I'm doing a horrible job of hiding that fact, Eastwood's direction and Haggis's writing do an excellent job of making the movie's most important events come out of nowhere to get to you. In most movies, you feel like you're just watching a fictitious adventure that's pretty cool. This is not the case. You'll feel as if you are getting a look into Frankie and Maggie's lives, and that is the mark of a job well done. You'll get the same feeling when watching 'Crash', which I've also reviewed. I'll admit, I watched this movie at my school's auditorium a few weeks ago because they showed it to kids who were excused from testing, but I decided to watch carefully and I'm glad I did. There's one other fact that made this movie so good: Never before had I seen something or someone that could silence 300 teenagers, but this movie did.9/10 --spy",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

As me and my mates have discussed it, it boils down to this:1) She doesn't try to be manipulative. She doesn't see herself as clever, as many women tend to. In stead, she does her best and gives her most, without regret. She doesn't try to sell herself with her ""interesting and quirky personality"", or push buttons. She wants to prove herself with achievement, actions. This is so incredibly rare, and stands out so much.2) She is goodnatured. Not a mean streak in her.3) Yeah, her being beautiful and feminine is a big part of it. But, though this is about the natural beauty of her face as well, it has much more to do with the way she acts and moves. A practical kind of femininity. Low on make-up, focusing very little on facial perfection, and in stead on fitness - which almost any of you can achieve - and feminine attitude - NOT to be confused with an attitude of weakness, as is too often the case. She's very respectful, but sure as hell not subservient.* This is turning into a bit of a rant, heh. But, seriously - if I get to just one female out there, it's worth it. I know that you young and brainwashed minds are oozing about out there, so listen up: the main character of this movie summarizes what I so often hear men agree that they are missing and searching for. Take those other role models out there, the pretty and weak and clever and dependant ones, and ****'em. They get attention, but of the short-lived and mean kind. In stead, be just half of what this girl is... and the worthwhile ones will single you out.Another amazing thing about this girl is that she would never excuse not bothering the effort by saying that it's ""too late"" to begin.{/rant}",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Far from knock-out,"There are some good boxing movies, but they all share the same problems: The boxing scenes aren't realistic. In ""Million Dollar Baby"" we meet the same problem. There are raw swings here, that wouldn't be accepted even by drunken gold miners in the West. It's obvious, also to a boxing ignorant.But surely Hillary Swank is good and Clint Eastwood too. But until the last half hour, you can't understand all the fuzz about this, except for the famous people who are in it. Swank does the boxing trash broad who fights herself up. You have seen it before, I promise.But in the end there is a discussion about existentialist matters, that you hadn't expected and Swank is really great here.

"Very good, but Mystic River was better","I really liked Million Dollar Baby, but what bothers me is that Mystic River was way better in every way but because of LORD OF THE RINGS, it didn't get the recognition it deserved at the Oscars last year. OK, Million Dollar is a beautifully written, somber, dark, drama but I don't think it was the best film of the year (AVIATOR). I found it a bit predictable with too many hints and foreshadowing in the film for the ending. The cinematography was perfect, but Morgan Freeman has been way better in other roles (Driving Miss Daisy, Glory and Shawshank). His quiet, expressionless janitor role won him an Oscar for obvious political reasons (he never won before). I think I'm just bitter that Million Dollar won the top awards such as best actress, director and picture. Sorry but how hard can it be to direct two other people and a few extras compared to Scorsese's work in the Aviator? Also Kate Winslet's performance in ETERNAL SUNSHINE was much more Oscar-worthy than the boyish-playing Hillary Swank which seems to be the only thing she's good at.. (Boys Don't Cry). WOW, she gained muscle, give her the Oscar!!! Million Dollar Baby is a great film but in all fairness, Eastwood's Mystic River was way better and I'm just bummed that Million Dollar has gotten more of the credit.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of the best films of 2004.  A heavy weight Oscar contender,"Heres a review for one of the best films of 2004, Million Dollar Baby. Gathering up seven nominations in this years Academy Awards, its one of the best-reviewed movie, and this one will really be no different.Million Dollar Baby is the story of Maggie Fitzgerald, played by Hilary Swank, a wanna-be boxer who has made it to her level by sheer determination and raw talent. Maggie seeks out the help of aging boxing trainer, Frankie Dunn, portrayed by director Clint Eastwood, who co-owns a boxing gym with retired boxer Eddie Dupris. Frankie, who has been burdened by his relationship with his estranged daughter, finds something remarkable in Maggie's determination, and is able to open up to a relationship with her. The film carries these characters through the pains and struggles of, not only boxing, but life as well to an astonishing and beautiful ending.I have to admit that all the other reviewers have been right. This movie is one of the best of 2004. The performances are remarkable along with the direction. Hilary Swank is astonishing and not only deserved the nomination for best actress, but also deserves the trophy. Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood both do a great job playing off of one each other as old boxing friends. The chemistry throughout the movie is spectacular. The script works on so many levels. The movie looks like a heavy drama, and is, but does not nerve away from adding some other great, heart-warming characters and some great lines.Clint Eastwood, as one would expect, truly grasps this story and makes it come alive with his directing. He is definitely a big contender in the best directing category for the Oscars, and may even walk away with the statue. Eastwood is able to make this movie about the boxer, and the trainer instead of about boxing, as some other directors would have. It's a movie about the life behind boxing, and that's what makes the film great.When reviewing a movie, a critic always looks for not only what was great about it, but also what hinders it. And I can honestly say that I cannot think of a single item. The only, for lack of a better word, problem I had with the film, is how much it looked like it reeked of ""gimme Oscars!"" However, it's less obvious in the actual film itself than in the trailer. And this ""fault"" is, by no means, a bad thing.Million Dollar Baby is a fantastic use of celluloid, and after my many reservations about the movie, I must concede to the professional reviewers and give this movie five stars. Because it is that good. While Sideways is my top pick for best film, Million dollar baby is definitely, soul crushing pun alert, a vicious right hook knock out.",,Anonymous,Drama
Clint Eastwood has done it again,"Clint Eastwood has done it again, directing and acting in another memorable film. 'Million Dollar Baby' will surely tug at your heartstrings by the end and give you some deserving reflection on parts of your own life too. The story encompasses a lot of human endurance's and dwells on the path one takes in life; whether it is the right onewe will never know for sure. It centers on the hopes and dreams of 3 main characters; - Frankie Dunn, Maggie Fitzgerald and Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris. Each has their own story to tell and this is done bit by bit throughout the film. Hilary Swank was a wise choice to play the part of Maggie Fitzgerald she is so convincing as the aspiring boxer with stars in her eyes. She wants to better herself and accomplish something in her life before it's too lateher dream to be the best boxer she can be. Not easy with an unwilling trainer and no previous formal training, which makes it that much harder. Yes, I suppose you've guessed by now this film is about female boxing and yes again, it's that good!!! Before I watched it I had no idea what it was about, not an inkling of what to expect at all.The 4 Oscar Awards absolutely deserved.everything concerning the production is excellent. Not to mention the acting.as always Morgan Freeman steals the limelight with his role of Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris - the gym caretaker who adds warmth and humor to an otherwise lonely place. Quite different from Frankie where he shows sarcasm and less confidence, Eddie (Morgan) plays off this with such a natural acting ability. The two congeal their parts so perfectly and the dialogue exchange between the two is sharp and witty, you'll be snickering to yourself when you hear it.'Million Dollar Baby' I think is a tremendous testimony of talent to one of today's most respected director/actor. Clint Eastwood has had a successful career behind the camera, he is (what I call) a thinking director  knows exactly how he wants his films done and simply does it. See it if you enjoyed watching the likes of 'Rocky' and 'Raging Bull'.not exactly on the same level of masculinity, though with a lot more heart!!! 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

impossible not to release tears,"This one of the most sad movies I've seen so far. Comparable in sadness and topic toChangeling (2008),Prison Break (2005)andRun (2020). Topic is serious, realistic and good, and it is not only sports or competition, but also humanity, faith, being injured, sick, and risking. Feelings of desperation, hope, disappointment dominate. Feeling is similar to encountering death, accident, loss in real life. Good actors who look like real trainers and sports players. Deep. But bad is the obvious negativity, even tough it's real. Best to watch for sports lovers and those not sensitive to negative stuff like injury, loss, and death.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Pretty good, but far from great","I'm not sure if this film's critical success stems more from a decline in film-making in general or Hollywood's love of Clint Eastwood. Heck, I love Eastwood. I also love Hillary Swank and Morgan Freeman, they are huge talents. However, this was a formulaic movie, very predictable in parts. You can almost see the numbers as Eastwood paints them in. This does not diminish from the fact that you have solid actors working hard. However, some of the supporting cast strains credibility, no more so than the family of Maggie's, who plays bad as one-dimensional as you can. And some of the boxing material is also a stretch. A fairly unknown female boxer a year into her career is fighting for a million dollar purse? Don't think so. Perhaps my review would be more positive if this film was not so highly rated, but it is, and I am not sure why.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Giving up the fight,"I don't know what it was about the early 2000s that turned Clint Eastwood's directing output around from largely middling fare to seriously fantastic filmmaking, but it honestly could be no more than him suddenly deciding to direct better scripts. He should keep doing that. What he found with Million Dollar Baby, a script by Paul Haggis, was a tragedy that gave him time to shine both in front of and behind the camera. I don't often get a bit choked at movies, but this is the first Eastwood movie to do that to me.Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) is a gym owner and trainer whose latest protégé, Mickey (Bruce MacVittie), is becoming impatient with Dunn's very slow approach to getting him a title fight. As Dunn's business partner and friend, Eddie (Morgan Freeman), says, Dunn could have gotten Mickey the shot two years before, but Dunn won't commit. And that is the early crux of the story. Dunn is a fighter who doesn't want to commit. He's always on his heels, unwilling to charge into the fight, and he does that on every facet of his life. Into that life comes Maggie (Hilary Swank), a poor, approaching middle-aged woman with dreams of becoming a successful boxer. She wants Dunn to train her to be a fighter, but Dunn is simply not interested. However, when Mickey leaves Dunn for another manager who will give him his shot at the title, Dunn suddenly finds himself a bit lost.This is a character piece at heart, and Frankie Dunn is a great central character. With a shadowed past of sin, in particular around his estranged daughter, he goes to mass daily where he seemingly just shows up to needle the priest (Brian O'Byrne) with borderline sacrilegious questions, a front to mask the guilt he carries around with him everywhere. Something in his past has kept him from reaching higher or faster, and then Maggie comes and is his exact opposite. She's untrained and overeager, winning small bouts messily in ways that show she's not ready to move up in class. She's also completely determined on getting Dunn as her manager, and she will not back down. Every time she moves in, he backs away, until he feels like he can't back away anymore, especially with Eddie encouraging them both at the same time.Maggie is an eager student and eats up Dunn's advice, quickly becoming queen of her small class and obviously ready for a move up. She is alone in Los Angeles, her family living off of welfare back in Missouri, and in Frankie she sees a potential father figure, the kind of caring, attentive person she'd always lacked. Considering Frankie's cantankerousness, there's a certain irony in it, but like Frankie's treatment of the priest, it's a front.And this is where the movie would feel the most generic save for Eastwood's directing style. If he were more of a chameleon, he'd ramp up the sports feeling of this middle section where Maggie begins to fight under his tutelage. However, Eastwood (for good or ill across his filmography) is just going to make movies his own, lowkey way no matter what, and it really ends up being an asset to Million Dollar Baby. Maggie has her rise to the top, but it's not handled in an over-the-top fashion, it's handled with tact and a certain quietness so that scenes of Maggie easily winning matches can rest surprisingly comfortably with small scenes of two people talking in subdued tones, like when Eddie explains to Maggie about how Frank tried to get him out of a fight decades past that Eddie refused to back out of where he eventually lost and lost his eye. Frankie never brings it up, but Eddie can see it in Frankie's face every time he looks at him.Frankie cannot let go of the past. It's why he goes to mass every day. It's why he acts so slowly in advancing in life. He's been hurt somehow, and he's carried that hurt for a very long time, and it's Maggie who finally finds a way to let him reach out to someone else again.And then, of course, the movie takes a hard turn in Maggie's title shot fight, and we suddenly see that no, we were not in a sports movie, but we've definitely been in a tragedy the whole time. This is why Eastwood's lowkey approach to the middle section is such an asset. We do get the standard elements of the sports underdog story, but keeping it muted in tone doesn't lead to a whiplash at the turn. We know we're in a drama primarily through the first 90 minutes, so when there's the turn, it's an evolution of that rather than a complete undermining of the more general sports take it could have had.The finale is dominated by Frankie's newfound determination to fight for Maggie. He fights for her health, for her money, and for her life. She has become his replacement daughter and he her replacement father. They are all they have in the world, and Frankie is going to do everything he can. He's going to fight for the first time in decades up until the point where Maggie stops fighting and gives up.This is the controversial part of the film, but much like the ending of Mystic River, it's an embrace of the morally complex. Frankie has an impossible decision to make, something that if he does it he will destroy his soul, as the priest says. This is a greater sin than anything he's committed in his life up to that point, and his scene with the priest is probably Eastwood's finest moment as an actor. He's completely torn apart by this, and his moment where he finally reveals himself (in part) to the priest is heartbreaking. He's going to do something wrong. He's going to hurt the woman who has become his daughter, but he feels like he has to do it because she wants him to.Could Maggie have lived a full life in her state? As full as any other handicapped person, but she doesn't see it that way. She's outright suicidal to the point that doctors have to keep her permanently sedated. She won't accept the life she suddenly has, and no one will convince her otherwise. What Frankie does is a mercy, but it destroys him in the process. He essentially vanishes, like a ghost. I remember reading the short story collection that inspired the screenplay (Rope Burns by F. X. Toole), and the writing there makes it more explicit that Frankie destroys himself in doing what he does. Of course, anything outside the film doesn't count, but Eddie's voice over (which wonderfully reveals itself to be a letter to Frankie's daughter by the end) reinforces the same idea. After it's done, Frankie has nothing.This is an awful choice that Frankie must make, and I was there with him. It was a gut wrenching decision that I might not have taken myself, but which I understood. He's finally found something to fight for, and he has to give it up. Not only is he losing his one real connection in the world, but he's also been defeated in reversing his entire outlook on life. She had opened him up to fighting again, to leading instead of falling back, and her pain knocked him back as well, but it was her giving up that knocked him flat. That's just good writing right there.I think Eastwood himself is the centerpiece in the acting round here, but the rest of the cast is wonderful as well. That starts with Swank as the white-trash with a dream Maggie, who's full of fight, not all that smart, but is willing to listen and learn. Her earnestness in her attempts make her a great scrappy figure at the center of a typical sports film, and the tragic direction in the final third she handles well in her limited physical state. Freeman is a rock that operates almost like a Greek chorus, especially in his voiceover (the mere presence of which was becoming something of a cliché at this point in cinematic history, for sure) while also offering up some of the film's small lighthearted moments. He also has some nice screentime with Jay Baruchel who plays a hopeless, all-heart welterweight wannabe who could never get a real fight.This is one of the triumphs of Eastwood's career. This is a hard-hitting film that perfectly matches with Eastwood's directing style. It's some of the finest acting in an Eastwood movie, all laid on top of a foundation written by Haggis that understands its structure and characters incredibly well.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
the best laid plans of..............,"i don't see what everyone is all up in arms over this movie about. true the actors do fine jobs in their given rolls but the movie seems like a cross pollination of rocky and Of Mice And Men. The hints that are dropped throughout the movie of what is coming at the end seem pretty clear and so the end doesn't come as much of a surprise. Clint Eastwood is great as Burgess Meredith and Morgan Freeman plays the same roll he plays in every movie, that of the aged, wise, and world weary man with hints of narration. If Freeman wasn't so good at playing the roll it would be unforgivable but try seeing if his roll from Glory, or Se7en, or Shawshank, or Unforgiven, or Kiss The Girls, is any different.....What really leaves a foul taste in the mouth and holds this movie back is the utter lack of reconciliation. The only bit of it comes between Freeman and a cocky young boxer. I'm shallow i like vengeance in film and too many characters do to many evil or annoying things without some sort of closure.

Morgan Freeman has a center roll in the movie as a narrator (much like Shawshank Redemption) and as Clints friend and fellow boxer/trainer. The two together with a fine performance from Hilary Swank make this film a must see. Take your Kleenex and be prepared. The music is clearly Clint and at times may remind you of pieces from Unforgiven.The film is simply awesome, moving and unpredictable.

Million Dollar Baby,"by Morgan Young.In this movie that features award winners, Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, and Morgan Freeman, you are taught a lesson: never let anyone stop you from fulfilling your dream. Scrap (Morgan Freeman) was a retired fighter. He cleaned Frankie Dunn's (Clint Eastwood) gym, and he always saw the good in everyone. Scrap was the one who saw something in Maggie (Hilary Swank) way before Frankie did.Maggie was a small town girl from southwestern Missouri. She grew up knowing that she would never amount to anything more than trash. All she wanted was someone to believe in her. Even without the approval of her family and others around her Maggie never let go of her dream of being a big time boxer. She always kept her unshakable focus.Frankie hated taking risks and never allowed himself to get close to anybody. That all changed, however, when he met Maggie. He took a chance and agreed to train her, not knowing that she would win him over. They would both face 'a battle that would demand their hearts and courage' stated by Scrap. They grew to have a strong friendship and found a sense of family in each other that both had lost a long time ago.As you follow the journey of Maggie and Frankie you will not only grow to cherish their friendship, you will see that the real magic in boxing is 'fighting battles beyond endurance and risking everything for a dream that no one sees but you'! No matter what, always remember the one key rule: ""Always protect yourself."" You will learn what happens if you don't, but only if you go see Million Dollar Baby!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Fantastic,"Went into Million Dollar Baby expecting a straightforward underdog sports drama, but what I got was something far deeper and more devastating. Clint Eastwood delivers a story that doesn't just tug at your heart-it tears it wide open.

The film isn't about boxing as much as it's about life, love, and the sacrifices we make for each other. By the end, I was sitting in stunned silence, overwhelmed by its honesty.

An inside look to a well read story!,"This film is made ever so much better by the fact that; for the most part, it is narrated by the attractively engrossing bitter truth that Morgan Freeman brings to everything he reads aloud. If you've seen the film 'The Shawshank Redemption', and enjoyed the narration within, you'll once again find the same comforting friend tell you another story.Hilary Swank, (as Maggie Fitzgerald), gives the performance of her career, as a woman not quite middle aged, but not exactly young either, chasing a dream of her youth that she just can't let go of. Clint Eastwood's, (Frankie Dunn), portrayal of a burnt-out & cantankerous boxer/trainer character, is so believable, it makes you feel as if you'd be anxious to try to please him, were you in Maggie Fitzgerald's,(Hilary Swank), place. How she plays into that interaction is the key to the tenderly complicated relationship that Maggie & Frankie develop. Morgan Freeman, (Eddie 'Scrap-Iron' Dupris), plays the character that ties everything together & bears witness to it all. His elocution of the facts are the base of the narration given throughout.Needless to say, the cast is exquisite, and the collision of fates within the story is inspiring.

Kind of Depressing Knock-Out Movie.,"This is an Oscar-winning film about Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), a waitress from a dysfunctional family, deciding to become a boxer. She seeks training from the experienced Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) to coach her and be her manager, with the support of his old partner Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman). What we see is a lower-class woman beating all odds to be a boxing champion, thus earning her a career that would put her in a better place in society. Swank gave a committed and solid performance, knocking out her opponents one after the other. What I like about Morgan Freeman is that he is steady, calm, yet powerful and dramatic is his acting. Clint Eastwood portrayed Dunn as pretty tired-looking and socially retired. He doesn't have much spirit and zest, due to his character being shut out of his daughter's life - very powerful. Eastwood also did a good job directing. Unfortunately, the movie does get pretty sad towards the latter half of the movie and the events only add on to the depressing life of Eastwood's character. My favorite scene in the movie is when Freeman knocks out an opponent of one of his trainees, proving that he still got the zest after all the years.Overall, a pretty powerful, but depressing film.Grade C",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

Hillary Swank proves that she deserves to be a 2 time Academy Award winner and gives an unforgettable performance.

A triumphant drama about triumph,"I don't think I need to say much. Million Dollar Baby is Clint Eastwood's masterpiece. Clint showed his knowledge of capturing melancholy elements, and casting them out gratefully in Mystic River. This was different. Some may say that the drama in the film was the last 20 minutes, where the characters face a drastic experience, but that was not the main point.Million Dollar Baby is a triumphant drama about triumph. We see Maggie Fitzgerald (played by Hilary Swank) triumph and conquer her way through boxing matches by hard work, determination, and the love of her boxing trainer named Frankie. (played by Clint Eastwood, himself) We hear Morgan explain ""If there's magic in boxing, its the magic of fighting battles beyond endurance, beyond cracked ribs, ruptured kidneys and detached retinas. It's the magic of risking everything for a dream that nobody sees but you.""The story is narrated by Mr. Scrap. (played by Morgan Freeman) They couldn't have chosen a better choice. Morgan Freeman is an excellent narrator; he captures the emotion in the scenes where it is necessary. After all, why would of he narrated in March of the Penguins and War of the Worlds? Most dramas have plenty of emotion, but those with a short attention span will probably not realize it, because of all the dialogue. This is different.There is just something about this movie that makes it so beautifully touching. The music that Clint showed off in Unforgiven is apparent here. The acting is better than good- It's so excellent.Million Dollar Baby knows when to be light-hearted and fun, and when to be moody and depressing. For example, in the first scenes, Clint shows off how much heart he can really put into a movie with the bond between Maggie and Frankie. The film becomes even more fun with some jokes added here and there. ""You spent so much time on the floor, that I thought the canvas had a pair of titties."" Crude, but hilarious. During the final scenes, the film goes on kind of long, but Clint Eastwood still manages to show all the heart he can put into a movie, and he knows how to put in the dark and tragic elements he added into many other films.Million Dollar Baby does have some dialogue, but manages to grab a hold of your interest. There is a certain unexplainable feeling that is in the movie. It seems to have a magical quality to it. Maybe it's the fact that the relationship between Maggie and Frankie is sweet and beautiful. (Beware, it is not a romance.) It could be that you think of a girl-who knows she's poor trash-work as hard as she can with the love of Frankie. Or, it could just be the fun boxing scenes, where people beat each other up. Who knows? This is surely one of the greatest and most memorable films of the year. Not many other films capture the glory of victory like this one does. Million Dollar Baby is truly triumphant, beautiful, touching and almost flawless. There are simply not enough words to describe it.Best Picture is only the start of the praise that this film truly deserves.10/10Good: Beautiful, good boxing scenes, full of heart and joy, funny, carries a certain light-hearted tone throughoutBad: The last scene is pretty long",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Eastwood answers it bravely and in a manner that will not be seen everywhere as being politically correct.Oscar level performances by all three main characters, but especially Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman (so the Academy and I finally agree, for once).

2004's Best Picture Masterpiece,"Today I finally had the pleasure of watching ""Million Dollar Baby"" on the DVD and I got to tell you that this is one of best boxing films and also the greatest Clint Eastwood film ever made at the same time.The film concentrates on the principal actors Clint Eastwood as the trainer, Morgan Freeman as the Narrator and friend, and Hilary Swank as the woman who wanted out of her old life to be a boxer, in which we get to study these look at these characters as human beings rather than just actors playing a part.Clint Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, a former professional boxer and trainer who runs a local boxing gym with his buddy Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris (played by Morgan Freeman) in which Jimmie knows the ropes on how to fight, how to move and how to win. In the prologue of the film, we see Frankie trying to heal a scar from a boxer before the boxing doctor comes to check. The character of Frankie Dunn doesn't have faith in the people he trains, after in a scene he tells the boxer that he doesn't want him to fight to get the title or else he'll get hurt; especially when Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) tries to come in and box at the gym, he tells Maggie that he doesn't train girls because it will look bad on his reputation.Maggie Fitzgerald has always dream of becoming a boxer as she attends every fight event that takes place in order to talk to Frankie, but he refuses to train her because she is too old. It doesn't stop Maggie as every day and night she trains at the boxing gym where Eddie gives out advice and tells her how to posture her movement. She doesn't quit until Frankie decides to help her. During the prologue of the film, Eddie explains the story behind Maggie as we see her working as a waitress in a dead-end job where she steals most of the leftover food and takes it back to her house where she eats the food.Eddie is the narrator, and the character that Morgan Freeman portrays is similar to Red Boyle from ""The Shawshank Redemption"" in which the character talks about the events that took place especially getting to know the characters a little better. Eddie is blind from one eye as he explains to Maggie that he lost it in his 109th fight when Frankie was his manager; he also lives in the gym where he has a small room near the entrance where he sleeps, eats and watches TV. Like Frankie, Eddie takes in a poor retard from the streets named Danger Barch (Jay Baruchel) in which the retard has dreams of winning the championship title; though the kid may never have a chance, Eddie will believe in him.""Million Dollar Baby"" is more than your ordinary boxing flick; it's also a character movie where we get to know these three characters and actually have feelings for them as we root them on. I was cheering when I watched this film as I watch the character Maggie win all the fights, including having a smile on my face when we saw Maggie and Frankie talking during a road trip. The last forty minutes of the film is a sad tragedy as we lose one of the main characters of the film; it is truly a great and powerful scene.Last year I saw Clint Eastwood's ""Mystic River"" a tragedy about three men and the nightmare that came back to haunt them; that was one of the best films I've ever seen from a Clint Eastwood movie; now after watching ""Million Dollar Baby"" on the DVD, Clint has completed his tragedy masterpiece where I will never forget that people do have chances in life.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"""This Is My Fighter""","Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) is a former cut man who now owns a gym. It's one of those no-nonsense gyms where fighters live their lives among the peeling paint, the stained canvas, and the discolored walls.Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman) is the manager of the gym. He and Frankie have a long history built on hard luck and a mutual understanding of unspoken debts.Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) picks Frankie to be her trainer, showing up one day with an eagerness borne of ignorance. He won't train her for various reasons, including her age, but she has heart, and even a hardened case like Frankie has respect for such desire, so eventually he gives in.There is no chewing of the scenery here. These actors deliver unstated elegance, like the music that accompanies the film. Their characters have nobility and a charm chiseled from the granite of their lives. They are all emotional orphans.Eastwood directs, acts, produces, composes; he probably swept the sets. He creates a piece of art that give the viewer characters that one can root for. Freeman is counterpoint to Eastwood. Voiceovers generally should be avoided, but here he provides a beautiful narration that illuminates. Swank's character has a yearning in her eyes. She lives her life in occasional teaspoons of accomplishment, always remembering her emotionally impoverished roots.""Million Dollar Baby"" is intelligently filmed and edited. The story is a heartbreaker. The acting is superb. The Oscars won were totally deserved. This is a film guaranteed to touch the viewer.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Another good film elevated to undeserving greatness at the Oscars,"The story of a white trash early 30s woman (Swank) determined to be a good boxer and the veteran coach (Eastwood) who reluctantly takes her on board. The tale is narrated by Eastwood's gym buddy Freeman.Solid direction from Clint, and a surprisingly good acting performance from him too. Swank does nothing wrong, and Freeman brings his usual trademark quiet dignity to his role. The story is simple. Swank surprises everyone with her boxing talent, Eastwood develops paternal feelings towards her and the two of them strike a father-daughter relationship. Swank's lack of a father figure in her life, and her clearly trashy family makes her relationship with Eastwood whose own daughter is estranged from him all the more relevant.Alas in time Swank gets bested by a top hardcore boxer, and she has to contend with her shattered dreams. Taking a philosophical angle, she contents herself with the thought that despite her career ending defeat and serious injuries she lived a lot more and made more of an impact in her world than she would have if she never got into boxing. Better to live a couple of years with intense passion than a lifetime as trash.Freeman won his long overdue Oscar, but this again highlights that Oscars are not about the best performances or best pictures. He is as usual good in his role, but he has given more impacting performances in more demanding roles in the past. Somewhat ironic then that he should win his first Oscar for this one.There is the obligatory sideline goings on at the gym, which feel a bit contrived. However Eastwood's direction is very good, and the three principal leads know what they are doing.My issue with the film's best picture win is less a criticism of the quality of the film than the politicking going on at the Oscars. Simple effective films like this have won in the past (like Ordinary People deservedly in 1980, Terms of Endearment undeservingly a couple of years later). But the best picture winner must feel like the best picture of the year. That Million Dollar Baby ain't. Eastwood has obviously built up a web of alliances in Hollywood, and is one of it's most influential figures.I suppose the fact that this film won Best Picture shouldn't be particularly surprising. Almost everyone knows that the Oscars are not about the best. It's about what looks good, what reflects the style and power play of Hollywood the best.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Clint Eastwood-excellent Actor/Director,"I admire Clint Eastwood a lot and think he is a genius film director comparable to John Huston and John Ford proving again and again that he is capable of handling any subject and giving it a fine finish. The talent of Clint is not limited to film direction only but he has excelled in acting as well. His forceful acting and direction has given us many good films: Fistful of Dollars, Good bad & ugly, Where eagles dare, Paint your wagon, Breezy, Play misty for me, Outlaw Josey Wales, The gauntlet, Beguiled, Pale rider, The unforgiven, Bridges of Madison, Midnight in the garden of good and evil and now Million dollar baby-the list is very impressive.

Hilary Swank was fantastic in this and you can't help but fall in love with her attitude, determination and unselfishness. Clint was perfect in this role, he reminded me of my grandpa, angry at the world in his own lovable way. My biggest criticism is that they don't go into enough of his past to explain him. Morgan Freeman plays perfectly right along side Clint and they do a great job playing the roles of long time friends. There is a magical touch to this film that is indescribable, you can feel the connection between the characters and you feel like you are watching something real. Unfortunately the ending leaves you a little down and incomplete. I think they could have cut that shorter and spared me the long drawn emotional pain.

Johnny we hardly knew ya.,"This is a moving yet frustrating film about the short career of a female boxer trained by an old embittered manager/trainer who still feels responsible for his former-protégé-now-business-partner's loss of an eye many years before. The three main characters are played, respectively, by Hillary Swank, Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman -- all powerhouse actors. The problem is that none of them has much to work with: the plot feels more like an outline than a finished story. Perhaps Eastwood, who also directed, was trying to convey the idea that in the ethically dubious world of professional boxing people just don't know each other very well, or want to. However, that shallowness of character makes it awfully hard for us, as viewers, to identify with the potentially very dramatic events that occur. Hillary Swank again puts in a stellar performance as the androgynous woman who remains persistently feminine despite outward appearances, just as she did in ""Boys Don't Cry."" And one wonders throughout, as so often (""Levity"" in particular comes to mind) why Morgan Freeman doesn't get top billing when he is the top character and top performer in every respect.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
The best film in a year of wonderful films.,"Million Dollar Baby is the best picture of the year through and through. After taking the history of motion pictures last semester, I somehow decided that I was going to reject the mannered style of classical Hollywood cinema such as Howard Hawkes and Frank Capra, where style and montage are subordinate to narrative. Despite this, I couldn't stop myself from falling in love with this film from the first frame until the last. Clint Eastwood has an eye for film-making and directing that is worthy of all accolades, including the Oscars. If there is any justice, Clint will walk away with his second best director trophy, well deserved over Martin Scorsese (who also directed a good film. Just not as good, and noticeably not as good.) Million Dollar Baby follows the rise of underdog boxer Maggie Fitzgerald, in a flawless performance by Hilary Swank who has proved that her turn in 1999's Boys Don't Cry wasn't a fluke. She too will take home her second Oscar, also well deserved over her ""overdue"" competition who will remain nameless. Maggie is too old to start training, too inexperienced to fight and too dumb to realize it. The film centers around her relationship with hardened fighter-turned-trainer, Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) who approaches her with steadfast reluctance that believably morphs into a paternal love that words can hardly describe. Eastwood too gives a wonderful performance as Maggie's trainer/surrogate father whose troubled relationship with his own daughter leaves a void that Maggie fills with her unwavering loyalty.Possibly even more wonderful than Eastwood and Swank is the film's narrator, Scrap played by the ever-lauded, yet still Oscar-less Morgan Freeman. His performance is on-point, consistent and almost effortless, as he narrates this tale with haunting grace. If this performance doesn't garner Freeman an Oscar, then there truly is no justice in the academy.To say that this film switches gears some two-thirds of the way through is redundant and pointless at this point, considering the press the film has received. I won't specifically divulge what that twist is because it isn't my place. Yes, this movie is at its heart, about far more than just boxing. The fact that this movie is getting some bad press from right-wing media, wasn't the most Oscar nominated film (Scorsese's the Aviator got the most noms) and lost the Producer's Guild award will logically keep Million Dollar Baby from stealing the best picture trophy from the Aviator. However, like Hilary Swank's Maggie, I believe that Million Dollar Baby, with the odds stacked against it, will rise above all obstacles and take home Oscars for best picture, director, actress and supporting actor. Clint has truly pushed himself to earn his best director and best picture trophies this time around. While it would be great to see Scorsese finally take home an Oscar (it's a travesty that he doesn't have one by now), the general consensus is that it's Clint who deserves it and I'd be loath to disagree.",,Anonymous,Drama

Is professional boxing a real sport?,"Since long time I am convinced of the need to prohibit men professional boxing, so for women it is much more obvious, and this film probably reflects much of our concern about this ""sport"" managed and ruled often by gangs. I still remember the Tyson-Hollyfield match, where Tyson finished biting Hollyfield's ear, ridiculous and anti sport behavior, but Tyson after sometime started to box again. Professional boxing destroyed several valuable boxers, among them Joe Louis, Kid Gavilan and others. Often you have an invented champion like Benny Parets in the 50s, who at the end was killed in the ring in a match with Emile Griffith. Parets was never a real champion, he was just the bait for a big match with Griffith, who was much better than Parets. Here the film goes around a girl of a very humble origin, with a family nearly illiterate and a bit wild. She wanted to help their relatives working and boxing, but her family wanted all money earned by her without giving any service to her at all. She (Hilary Swank) was persistent in her intentions to become a boxer, and was good under the advice of his trainer (Clint Eastwood), and got nearly all victories in the ring except one. The film plot is interesting in general, but I am asking myself: what happened to that wild woman boxer who did not follow the rules of the fight? The film never said nothing about her final fate, probably she continued behaving herself as she was. In boxing the spectacle is much more important than the human's life, the rules are made to see bloodshed, people falling down after several punches and agonizing. There is no protection to the man, at the end if he/she dies, who cares? These constraints are well shown by the film, which could have gone deeper into this problem, but probably Eastwood preferred to show some insides of this ""game"". It is not the first film about the problem of professional boxing, but it's the first one including women. Good acting of Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman, in fact both really were well awarded by their acting, Eastwood was also good but a little bit under the level of Swank and Freeman.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

"$500,000 Cliché **","(Spoilers Galore):Here it is in a nutshell, so don't read if you haven't seen the movie or if you don't want the whole thing revealed to you: Clint Eastwood is a crusty old fight manager whose latest client decides to bail out on him, so when a feisty and determined girly boxer named Maggie (Hillary Swank) shows up at his gym and begs him to train her, he eventually agrees after first putting her off. The girl becomes a really good fighter, knocking all the competition out in the first round, but ultimately meets her match in a dirty-fighting opponent who breaks her neck in the ring and sentences her to a fate at the hospital, where she loses her will to live.Here we have another one of those non-deserving Best Picture Winners. Let's not get carried away here -- the film is ""pretty good"" at best, and certainly watchable, but this is nothing more than a retread of so many other boxing and heart-tugging tearjerkers that I'm surprised so many embraced it. All I can guess is that a lot of people never saw the ROCKY films, LOVE STORY or TERMS OF ENDEARMENT. This is a familiar old tale: ""Struggling boxer wants to be managed by the best, and an aging old trainer wants one more shot so he hesitantly accepts the challenge. And then, toss in a heaping helping of sudden tragedy from other tearjerkers which causes everyone to pull out their handkerchiefs and Kleenex"". The End.The assets of the film come from the performances of Eastwood, Swank, and also the dependable Morgan Freeman, along with heart and soul and a collection of characters that really relate to one another well. Clint's trainer in particular is given a complex nature, as he goes to church every day to talk to his priest and is haunted by the mistakes he feels he's made during his years. But Swank's Maggie turns out to be a real phony in the end, as she decides that life without one of her limbs is no longer worth living. I don't have a problem with that decision in and of itself, but up to this point we've been hit over the head again and again that Maggie is one tough cookie who never says ""no"" and doesn't stop fighting. I didn't buy for a minute that she'd give up the real fight of her life when the going really got tough.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

Mo Cuishle...,"About Clint Eastwood's last movie I'd heard it was something we had seen a million times; very cliché. I don't pretend to get inside the story, because I shouldn't tell much of it, but it is, with a simple look, what we've already seen in ""Rocky"", and maybe in ""Karate Kid""; two classic movies of the genre. But Clint Eastwood doesn't dig the classic, he digs the proper; and the fact of not winning the awards he won this year with ""Mystic River"" is intriguing. And ""Million Dollar Baby"" won them not because of its relation with other films, but on its own right.The emotional power this movie has and many other things, are comparable to the equally good ""Mystic River"". The thing is Eastwood knows how great he is and he closes with the credits in white; simple, over the black screen in both films. Anyway, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is another movie, and if it entered late in the radar, it didn't matter because Eastwood knew what he had in his hands and what it would be, more than anyone.Again he looked for stories that excellent screenwriters would adapt (Brian Helgeland the last time, now Paul Haggis), composed the music and produced his piece. However he is not proud, and if one doesn't know what is to see, finds out about all this in the end. This round, he added an habitual detail in his directions, that turned down a couple of years ago, but concluded now in another Oscar nomination: his performance in the movie. Between the darkness and the lights sow well handled under his lead, I was able to see some faces that spoke for themselves, and acted. The pro was also thrilling in the beautifully written chats Frankie, his character, shared with Scrap (played by Morgan Freeman). With a lot of knowledge, both men exchanged words as the figures they are and as their characters, friends who have been giving each other support since always, and know that's not going to change, so they're not afraid of honesty. These chats turn out to be between the film's best moments.Clint directed and acted in top form, without forgetting about the partners around him. In Hilary Swank he saw the love and commitment with acting, getting the best of her, en what is more than a transformation. The transformation is part of the commitment, but the love enters in knowing how to use it, because: What good does a transformation has if it won't be taken advantage of? Completing one of the best ensemble works I've seen since...Well, since ""Mystic River"", Morgan Freeman played his cards once again, narrating and talking wisely to receive the Oscar he should have had over a decade ago for ""The Shawshank Redemption"", were he was splendid.The way Clint Eastwood has to escape from the obvious (a man who directed lots of westerns, which are pretty obvious), can be seen clearly in all those moments where you're waiting something typical and his camera, or his movie's script, doesn't give it to you. In ""Rocky"", the man trained by himself, and felt proud of that; in ""Million Dollar Baby"", our girl is in desperate need for one only trainer, and besides being proud of, loves him. It's amazing how he loves her back.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Fantastic,"The U-turn this film takes is one for the ages, and gives the film an emotional element to go along with its inspirational main character. Hilary Swank is extraordinary in every aspect, infusing her character with authenticity and looking every bit a real boxer. She makes this movie worth seeing, even if you're not a fan of the sport. Clint Eastwood is great too, though the script relies a little too much on the crusty old men shtick, and uses Morgan Freeman in a way I've seen too many times to truly enjoy, narration and all. The depiction of the welfare family is a little cartoonish and the dialogue at times is mediocre, but those quibbles aside, my goodness, the film packs quite a wallop. I liked how each phase of the story gripped the heart in some way, and had genuine tension. I also liked how the backstory for Eastwood's character, his alienation from his daughter, is never fully explained. There is a certain depth to how the ending raises moral questions, and Eastwood's performance in these scenes is among my favorite of his career. It evokes the W. B. Yeats poem quoted in the film:I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,
And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made;
Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee,
And live alone in the bee-loud glade.And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,
Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;
There midnight's all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,
And evening full of the linnet's wings.I will arise and go now, for always night and day
I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;
While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,
I hear it in the deep heart's core.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Good Old Fashion Storytelling,"The funny thing is that a few months before this film came out, I was extremely disappointed with cinema in general and asked, ""Why can't anyone just make a simple story and tell it?"" Sure, there's a handful of films out there like that, but why are they so few and far between? Why must there be gimmicks? Why so many distractions (that don't distract) for the audience? And along comes Clint Eastwood . . . thank you, Mr. Eastwood for having integrity and making the movies you want to make.I love this movie. I'd go as far as to say it's one of the best films I've seen in the past ten years. What is Million Dollar Baby? Just a good old fashion movie, shot in a solid old fashion style, whose focus is squarely placed on its characters where it belongs. That's it ladies and gentlemen. This is story telling at its best.And honestly, the story really isn't even remotely unique  a character has a dream and shoots for it despite the opposition. This same story has been told thousands of times under thousands of titles and thousands of variations on the circumstance--in one movie it happens to be a warrior fighting for a cause, in another movie it's about an Olympic team, here it's simply about a woman who wants to take up boxing. But you know what? If it's done well, it doesn't matter how many times we've heard variations on the tale.Million Dollar Baby is done well.I could go through and talk about the characters, the wonderfully realistic, sincere, and heartfelt performances from Eastwood, the ever-awesome Morgan Freeman, and Swank, but this film's strength lay in ""how"" and not ""what."" As stated earlier, it's a simple story that's been told numerous time--person has a dream and chases it--what separates Million Dollar Baby from the rest of the pack is how the story/characters are presented, and that needs to be experienced first hand.Even if people are usually turned off by ""sports"" films (believe me, I'm one of them), I still highly recommend Million Dollar Baby because, quite frankly, this is not a sports movie. In Million Dollar Baby you meet Eddie, Franky, and Maggie, you spend time with these three, learn about them, and they become real so you no longer watch their lives, you experience it too.It's somewhat strange that the best films I've seen I have so little to really say about them. The greatest compliment I can give to any film is simply stating that an accurate description is beyond words. It has to be seen, heard, and felt. The film has to be experienced.Million Dollar Baby is one of those movies.",,Anonymous,Drama

Million Hearts Won,"To tell you the truth I'm not a big fan of boxing, in fact I think it is basically repugnant sport (if two people trying to brain each other can really be considered a sport). So for this film to win me over, it had to be really special. And it was. One of the reasons for this is that although the film does show the positive aspects of boxing, it doesn't glorify it. You see everything – the glory, the pain, the heartbreak, the feeling of belonging that is all some people have to hold on to. This film takes you on a real roller-coaster of emotion, taking you from the bottom to the top and back again.Million Dollar Baby is the story of a female boxer Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), her trainer Frankieie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), and his sidekick and business partner Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris (Morgan Freeman). If anyone had doubts about the genius of Clint Eastwood, they should run, not walk to see ""Million Dollar Baby"", perhaps the best movie that came out of Hollywood about boxing after Raging Bulls. But mind you Million Dollar Baby is not a feminist version of Raging Bull, intent on bludgeoning the audience with gritty violence. Nor is it a maudlin rewrite of 'The Champ' or a woman's version of 'Rocky'. Million Dollar Baby is a rhapsody about life, using the harsh world of boxing as a metaphor.In ""Million Dollar Baby,"" Frankie is a trainer and manager who never seems to know when to make a move or throw in the towel. He is also the owner of the Hit Pit, a boxing gym where would-be contenders look to flourish under Frankie. The gym manager is one of his former boxers, Eddie ""Scrap Iron"" Dupris (Morgan Freeman). After Eddie's career ended, Frankie became less sure of himself as a manager. Eddie tells us, though, that Frankie is the best cut man he's ever seen. Frankie can prepare virtually anyone to get back into the ring between rounds.Enter Maggie Fitzgerald, a woman who squeaks out a living by waiting tables at a local restaurant. She has some street smarts, and some talents using her fists. Her dream is to be a champion female boxer and she knows just the place to practice- the gymnasium operated by Frankie. Maggie wants Frankie to be her coach and her persistence pays off when he finally gives in and agrees to train her in the sport of boxing.What makes this film so entertaining is its winning formula. On every level, this movie succeeds at captivating the audience and making them anticipate the next scene. Here story isn't as predictable as other sports films and many scenes will catch you off guard. A great movie does not need awesome special effects, loud musical scoring, fad or fashion. It just needs plain old-fashioned quality film making where talented people perform at the top of their craft.'Millon Dollar Baby' strikes you when it's least expected. There are many points which leave you wonder: What do you live for? For basic survival or for reaching your goal, so you can be your true self? Are you willing to pay for it? No matter what? And what is life about? If you had seen the film, you would understand what I'm talking about.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Clint Eastwood Masterpiece,"""Million Dollar Baby"" is one of the finest films ever made, but I can't list it among my personal top favorites simply because it is so, so sad. It is such an original story and screenplay, but it took a great Director like Eastwood to make it into this great a film. Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman definitely deserved their Oscars for their performances. Swank's performance is among the very best by an actress that I have ever seen. It's also interesting, at least to me, that Swank, who was 30 years old at the time, plays the role of Maggie, who was 31-32 in the story. Eastwood's performance was also good enough for an Oscar, but winning Oscars for both Best Picture and Best Director must have been very satisfying. Freeman is simply one of the best Actors in the business, and he easily could have won Oscars for at least three other of his performances.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Wow, what a great show! Eastwood's just getting better!","I personally am not a huge fan of boxing movies or any other films falling into that kind of category. However, I have to say that Million Dollar Baby, with the legendary Clint Eastwood as lead actor and more importantly, as director, made this movie into a masterpiece. It just works wonderfully on every level necessary to make a great movie. Along with Clint, we have Hilary Swank and the also well-known Morgan Freeman, who won on Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in this movie.Million Dollar Baby is a great movie with tremendous good boxing action and later on, heart-breaking drama that will bring tears to your eyes. The bond between the two main characters and what eventually happens to one of them just rips anybody's soul apart. And I just love how Morgan Freeman is playing an in-the-background, but equally important character. He definitely deserved the Oscar he won.And Clint deserved what he got as well. Just like he had done with his hit Western ""Unforgiven"", he made a great movie out of this by directing and playing the lead role in this. He did a great job as a cantankerous and rough boxing trainer who eventually realizes that he can have a heart.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The Most Non-Self Indulgent Film Ever Made aka Possibly The Greatest Film Ever Made!,"I hate to see everyone nitpicking at stupid details such as when Maggie goes down and hits her head on the chair, everyone is silent. ""In real life there is no way that would happen, fans would get up, throw things, the trainer would retaliate."" People, first of all, Eastwood isn't wasn't nor will he ever be a boxer. He could have chosen any sport or medium through which to tell his tale. Boxing and a woman just so happen to be great choices for a few reasons, #1 not everyday stuff (woman wanting to be a boxer) #2 great way to symbolize a desire and hidden feelings toward the unexpected for both the female boxer and the trainer. This movie was shot with such impeccable detail that you can bet 80% of most viewers have these things go unnoticed, and cannot identify them, yet almost all of these people are subject to the effect the cinematography has. THAT is truly brilliant. The subtleties like the noir-like voice overs and typical lighting (darker) and word choice in dialog esp between Swank and Eastwood as we see how Maggie truly loves her trainer as a father. And he the same. When Maggie falls down in the ring and gets injured, it is such a dark moment because Eastwood has realized the (in his mind) inevitable tragedy which he has led Maggie into. At that point in time, he already realizes retaliation would be of no use. I actually think that part is one of my favorites. Eastwood is so hit by the fall that he is already past anger and revenge. As if there was a part of him that knew this would happen and now he is feeling guilt and hopelessness. Its really an amazing scene. The filming of that scene also totally emphasizes his inner darkness and pain. This movie stays away from clichés and doesn't give the audience what it wants to see. It doesn't even deal with Maggies death in a ""noble"" way. Its very real. And that is shocking. This movie is 100% guaranteed to withstand the test of time. I don't know much about Clint Eastwood, but this is all I need to know. The man is brilliant. If you don't shed a tear in this movie, you have no heart. Swank deserves an Oscar, so does Eastwood for the directing. Freeman is the only Cliché (the wise old has been black guy) but if you study his character closely you will see how he is actually not clichéd at all. This movie is so powerful that you need a few hours to recuperate and that gut feeling you get during the movie sticks with you for days, and the appreciation will last forever. GREAT MOVIE. MASTERPIECE.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Instead of watching ''It's a Wonderful Life'' on Christmas, I've watched this.","And it torn me apart. I have to recognize that Clint Eastwood has a talent in telling great stories about people who win by losing. I was impressed when I first saw his great anti-war story fueled and filled by/with humanity , 'Letters from Iwo Jima'' , but now he's taken one step further and hit close to home for me.Maybe it wasn't the best time of the year to see it but hey, luckily this Christmas feels a bit different due to the pandemic and maybe something unconventional is a good idea after all.A 10 out of 10 from me.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Million Dollar Baby - Million Dollar Experience,"Heavy. Not in a ponderous way. More like overwhelming. While the movie has many parts that are light hearted and pleasant, the confluence of its undercurrents and themes towards the end seems almost too much to grasp. It left me deep in thought, struggling to deciminate this striking portrayal of human relationships. Acting was superb. The plot moved. I cared about the characters. Violence was sometimes difficult to watch but meaningful. Only criticism I had was some of the scenes could have used a little more lighting (too film noirish) and at times I had problems following the dialogue. One of my co-workers said this movie was not about boxing. I tend to disagree. It was about boxing, but was also about life, love, caring, redemption and dedication. Tough at times to watch, it was tough to forget. If you want ""Singing in the Rain"" or other family fare, this isn't the picture. If you want to feel emotions, whether they be happy, sad, or anywhere in between, if you want to care about the characters you watch and think about them later, put this one on the list.",,Anonymous,Drama
A disturbing drama about the highs and lows of boxing.,"This is a very accomplished picture (directed by Eastwood) about the fight game but one that is troublesome and without giving too much away, truly disturbing (In fact so much so, I don't think I'll be revisiting this one). Such films to me are way more scary than any horror movie and total respect for anyone (man or women) brave enough to climb through the ropes.

Very good movie about  an aspiring woman boxer.,"This movie is really two movies in one. The first half is about an aspiring woman boxer and the problems she must overcome to get where she wants to go, and also about her trainer and how he gets involved with her. But the second half of this movie is the real drama, about how people affect each other's lives and how they find meaning by taking that one shot and how they face adversity. I would have given this movie a perfect ten but I was really in the mood for something a little more uplifting, instead of deep. Still, the acting couldn't have been better, the plot was interesting, the cinematography was good, the direction was excellent. Go see it!",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Certainly one of the best Eastwood's films,"I have seen this movie fairly recently and I have been absolutely amazed by it. I have seen a lot of Clint Eastwood's movies in the past such as ""Invictus"", ""Letters of Iwo Jima"", ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"", ""Gran Torino"" and so on... ""Million Dollar Baby"" is right at the top; Indeed, Mrs Swank, Mr Freeman and Mr Eastwood are spectacular. Their performances are outstanding through the entire movie and the story of this masterpiece is greatly inspiring. Before watching it, I was expecting another ""boxing movie"" but it was all but boxing. Of course, boxing is present however, the main plot is the relationship between Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman. Anyone who will see this film will be shocked, amazed and inspired. ""Million Dollar Baby"" it is not only a ""must-see"" movie but a ""must-see"" Masterpiece. I firmly believe this movie is able to touch you in unique ways and I would recommend this movie to everybody.

Please see this movie!!!,"Clint Eastwood is a master director and with this movie he is at the top of his game. If you liked Clint's directorial efforts in Unforgiven and in Mystic River, you will love his efforts in Million Dollar Baby. Brilliantly acted with Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Hilary Swank at their best, the movie is one of the best movies of the last few years. The three actors all deserve their Academy Award nominations and maybe this is finally the movie that gets Morgan Freeman his long deserved Oscar.The movie is very poignant and funny at the same time.

It's even harder to imagine that the man was nearly seventy years old at the time.

Good film from Eastwood,"Good Eastwood film. Like ""Gran Tornio,"" it's a tragedy -- but unlike ""Mystic River,"" it packs an emotional wallop, punching into the viewer gradually, jabbing and hooking, weaving a bit, then slamming the audience hard with tragedy, knocking us out with a painful blow that never once rings sentimental, or false. Freeman is superb, as always, while Swank proves the genius demonstrated in ""Boys Don't Cry"" was no fluke. Eastwood gives one of the most sensitive performances of his career.

Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman had some funny moments together which was nice considering the rest of the movie was a hard drama.

Eastwood's 'Million Dollar Baby' packs an emotional punch with powerful performances and nuanced storytelling,"""Million Dollar Baby"" directed by Clint Eastwood is a gripping and emotional tale of a female boxer who strives to achieve greatness in the ring. With outstanding performances from its cast, this film is a masterful exploration of the human spirit, determination, and the bond between trainer and fighter.Hilary Swank delivers a raw and intense portrayal of Maggie Fitzgerald, a waitress turned boxer, who teams up with veteran trainer Frankie Dunn, played by Clint Eastwood, to pursue her dream. The chemistry between Swank and Eastwood is palpable, and their performances make for a powerful and moving experience.The film is also elevated by its excellent supporting cast, with Morgan Freeman giving a standout performance as Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, Frankie's former boxer and close friend. The characters in the film are complex, and the relationships between them are layered and nuanced, adding depth and richness to the story.The film's cinematography is also noteworthy, with its moody lighting and close-up shots conveying the intensity and physicality of the boxing matches. The score is equally impressive, complementing the film's emotional moments with a poignant and stirring soundtrack.Ultimately, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a profound and touching film that explores the themes of perseverance, sacrifice, and the power of the human spirit. It's a must-see for fans of drama and sports movies alike.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Million Dollar Baby is much more than a boxing movie. It is a drama about overcoming, courage and determination!","How far are you able to go for a dream? Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) shows us that there are no limits to getting what we want. Million Dollar Baby didn't get so many awards for nothing. It has its merits, and they are not few. It could just be a boxing movie, but it surprises and proves to be a competent and exciting drama. The 25th feature film directed by Clint Eastwood, which, like The Unforgivable, deservedly took home four Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director, is a triumph of character studies in an intimate, delicate, and moving approach that is never seen before. Valley of exaggerations or cheap sentimentality to pass on its simple message.Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) has spent his life in the ring, managing and training great boxers. Frankie often teaches the fighters he works with the same lesson he follows for his life: first of all, protect yourself. Hurt with the removal of his daughter, Frankie is a closed person and only relates to Scrap (Morgan Freeman), his only friend, who also takes care of his gym. Until Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) comes into his life, a determined young woman who has an unfinished gift for boxing. Maggie wants Frankie to train her, but he doesn't want to train women, and besides, he believes she's too old to start a boxing career. Despite Frankie's denial, Maggie decides to train daily at the gym. She receives support from Scrap, who encourages her to keep going. Overcome by Maggie's determination, Frankie finally accepts being her coach.In essence, it's just three characters. Frankie Dunn is an aging boxing trainer who runs a run-down gym in Los Angeles where his friend and ex-pupil Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris lives., also, of narrator in a very similar way to the work of the actor in The Shawshank Redemption. Into this masculine and decadent environment, young redneck waitress Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) arrives wanting to train with Frankie, even though he repeatedly says he doesn't train girls. Scrap is that, seeing there a light, a hope in the darkness, he needs to convince his friend to give the young woman a chance, which ends up rekindling an old flame in Frankie.The relationship between Frankie and Maggie, which Eastwood Lens lovingly builds, isn't a loving one, though. Nor is it something you could call father and daughter, even if there are undeniable contours of it. There is something even deeper there, a co-dependency that is difficult to explain, but which Maggie sums up when she says, after the two of them visit her disgusting mother (played by Margo Martindale), with a simple ""you are all I have"". Maggie sees in Frankie her freedom, freedom to have the chance to pursue a life other than that of a waitress who would undoubtedly end up just like her mother, living in a trailer and living on government aid. Frankie, for her part, carrying guilt on her shoulders related to Scrap that even her daily visit to the Church for 23 can't atone for, has in Maggie a kind of spiritual salvation, but not exactly absolution, but something like her last chance at life. Smile and breathe a sigh of relief, probably for having managed to do something with his life.Eastwood, the director, extracts exquisite performances from everyone. Swank does her life's work as the hopeful young woman who doesn't want much more out of life than to have a chance to succeed. The way Maggie looks at Frank is a mixture of reverence and thanks, in the same way that she manages to convey genuine love, like a child looking proudly at his father, without the exact awareness that this feeling is more than reciprocal. But it's not just the chemistry between the actress and Eastwood that works well, as one of the most touching scenes in the work is when Maggie and Scrap talk in a restaurant about Frankie, in which we see the actress, practically immobile, give herself so completely to his role, convincing us so deeply of his immersion in his character, that we forget we're watching a movie. Freeman, on the other hand, is the wise man who sees the situation very clearly from the outside looking in and narrating it in a way that only an actor can. As in The Shawshank Redemption, his role in Million Dollar Baby is undeniably very similar to that of Red, the inseparable friend who deeply understands the subject of his observation. The other two Oscar statuettes, for Actress and Supporting Actor, were also surgically given to the two.However, the Academy failed to award Eastwood despite his Best Actor nomination. If he already deserved the statuette for his work in The Unforgivable, here he reaches his highest point in his acting career. Frankie Dunn is an externally tough man like the vast majority of characters played by Eastwood, but, in Million Dollar Baby, the viewer realizes very clearly that this unbreakable appearance takes a huge and disproportionate price that takes the character away from the world and from more human interactions. Relevant than your connection to Scrap. As is the motto of the feature, at no time does the viewer receive this information about his past chewed up on a silver platter. The script by Paul Haggis is much smarter than that and makes the presence of Father Horvak, played by Brían F. O'Byrne, the most didactic sign of this condition of the protagonist that goes far beyond his past with Scrap. And the final moments of the film leave Eastwood exclusively with the task of making the work work without fussiness, something he sensationally achieves when he finishes transforming his irreducible Frankie into a conduit of love, life and the search for some kind of happiness.As a director, Eastwood noticeably evolves. It's okay that he exaggerates when he villainizes Maggie's opponent's boxers - a primary mistake that risks playing the film in simplest - but the filmmaker's successes are greater than the slips. Take, for example, his portrayal, at the same time affectionate and implacable, of the customs and people of the South of the USA - the character Danger, by the great actor Jay Baruchel, with his thick accent and his excessive self-confidence, is a rare find. Eastwood's courage to develop extreme situations, both visually and metaphorically, such as the signing of the contract in the hospital, is something that is not normally seen in a prudish industry like the North American one.The director is equally careful and delicate, transforming Frankie's gym into the beating heart of his feature, the place where everything most relevant happens as a true character. It is there that hopelessness and loneliness give way to hope and connection, with the music composed by the director underlining this transformation. But shadows are very important in Million Dollar Baby. They set the mood and mark the beginning and end of the work with a flawless photograph by Tom Stern, who has been with Eastwood since his debut in this chair in Debt of Blood. Using a lot of natural light and letting the shadows completely take over the narrative in some moments, sometimes even hiding the actors - notice the phenomenal lighting in the sequence where Maggie and Frankie talk in the car or the very long shadows in the final sequences -, bathing them in an air of melancholy and hopelessness.Million Dollar Baby is much more than a boxing movie. And look, they talk about it almost all the time. I can say that they breathe boxing. It's strong, heavy, surprising. It is a drama about overcoming, courage and determination. Maggie had everything to give up her career: financial difficulties, a little old age for boxing (as Frankie said) and a family that didn't support her and only thought about financial compensation. But she didn't give up and fought until the end. This is a very simple work, full of subtleties, which moves us and teaches us that we cannot give up on our dreams.It's certainly one of the best films Eastwood has directed, considering at least About Boys and Wolves and The Unforgivable in this feud, but the film certainly seems to be the most mature and most human of the actor-turned-filmmaker's vast body of work. An audiovisual triumph that enchants and excites without dictating feelings and without ever betraying its proposal. Hollywood has already given audiences boxing masterpieces, such as Scorsese's Raging Bull (1980). They are classics precisely because they borrow sport as a motto to talk about life. And as much as it looks like a traditional film, Million Dollar Baby shows its authorial value between the lines. Knowing when to resist and also when to let your guard down is your most valuable lesson for the real world.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

A Raw Emotional Powerhouse - Raging Bull For The Millennium,What do I say? Epic Direction. Really intense ring footage. Really nice narrative by Sir Morgan Freeman. The script is polished. The acting is first class. It really delivers a huge knock-out and it's for me the best boxing movie after Raging Bull!The ending is extremely tragic and raw. The only thing I am not sure about is the casting for her mother and how different she is to her. However the accents and regional hillbillyisms are played superbly.It's totally raw and in-your-face. The script is excellent. I love the little plays in the gym between boxers. Really romanticising boxing. The brutal honesty of boxing and the money and fixing is open and blatant. I'm not sure with modern sport regulations if that would happen now.Hillary Swank is a mesmerising actor. I really feel for her for how hard this movie was to make. A true powerhouse actor who really emulated Robert DeNiro in Raging Bull. Absolutely superb performance!The chemistry was fantastic. Morgan and Eastwood both together is a pleasure to view. Absolutely on top of their game. The film really touches on how difficult it must be to run a boxing gym.Some of the comedy in this black film is fantastic. It's a real emotional roller-coaster of a movie. I especially loved Jay Baruchel.as Danger Barch and. Special mentions for Anthony Mackie and Mike Colter for very believable roles.I just loved the movie. The only thing I thought which did not make it a 10 is how different her mum was from her. The shot at the end also made me question something too! However it's a minor issue in an otherwise epic movie.Really fantastic direction and acting from Sir Clint Eastwood too. What a powerhouse. Now he is a powerhouse director and actor. I would like him to make a few more sports' movies before his long overdue retirement!What a movie backed by a stella cast with excellent dialogue and a great script. So much action and drama. Evocative of Raging Bull and so refreshing to see a female lead for this genre!,9.0,Anonymous,Drama
If you are looking for a good mix of action and drama this is a great film.,"This film introduces a struggling thirty-one year old waitress named Maggie, played by Hillary Swank, who has a desire to make it big in the women's boxing arena. Her biggest obstacle is to convince Frankie, played by Clint Eastwood, to accept the position to train her to be a prize winning fighter. Frankie doesn't seem interested in this endeavor due to his past mistakes while training Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris played by Morgan Freeman. Eddie ""Scrap"" just happens to be Frankie's only real friend, who lives and works in the ""Hit Pit"", Frankie's rundown old gym in Los Angeles, California. Scrap noticed Maggie's potential and works on getting Frankie to forgive himself and give Maggie a chance.I was drawn to watch this film because of the appearance that is was an action boxing film but it turned out that it was more dramatic verses action packed. I'm not into watching dramas, however, this film had a good balance of action scenes to keep my interest. The dramatic elements of the film were also interesting and added to the overall theme of getting Frankie to give himself another chance at training as well as letting Maggie have the opportunity to show the world what she is made of.The storyline continues as Frankie trains Maggie and they develop a strong father-daughter bond. During this time Frankie begins to feel he has made the right choice in training Maggie because she turns out to perform very well. Frankie finds redemption from his inner demons and fears by watching Maggie doing what she loves, this reminds him of a relationship with his own daughter that he neglected to cultivate. Unfortunately as fate would have it, the story takes a dramatic turn for the worst and Frankie is again faced with making a moral decision at Maggie's request. This film's theme is similar to that of ""The Karate Kid"" where and older and wiser father figure takes a young naive apprentice under his wing. In this film, Frankie takes Maggie under his training ""wing"" to develop her natural skills into ones that will allow her to beat the odds and live her dream of being a prize fighter.The use of the close up accessory lens in the gym office scene with Frankie and Scrap was a good example of how the cinematographer is able to focus in on the foreground on one side and background on the opposite side. This allowed the viewer to see Maggie's determination toward her training in the background while viewing the conversation between Frankie and Scrap in the foreground.This film shows that in spite of your past failures life can give you opportunities to overcome inner struggles. It also proves that with hard work and determination anything is possible.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Still amazing after nearly twenty years,Saw this on a list of great movies and although I'd seen it when it was released I thought I'd give it another go.Wasn't disappointed.Everything in this movie shines.I remember at the time of release there was a lot of praise for Hillary Swank and the amount of training she'd put in to add credibility to the character. She plays this role to perfection. It would have been so easy to fall short of playing this role because of the technical and fitness requirements but it was only after the film finished that I even thought about it. Totally seamless.Another great aspect of this film is the greed of the main characters family. Another aspect that could have jarred but didn't.I suppose Clint Eastwood and Malpaso were just a film making machine at this point in time and this film is a master class.

The biggest problem I have with it is that the storyline seems to attempt to be true-to-life but if you examine it, it is so utter preposterous: a woman in the first flushes of middle age (Hilary Swank) decides to start boxing and convinces a reluctant veteran (Clint Eastwood) to train her; then within a year or two she is a boxing world champion defeating the stereotypical evil European opponent. (Frankly, when I see an American film that contains a ""foreign baddie"" (and sadly, so many do), it's a pretty clear indicator as to what kind of audience they are targeting.) Give me a break. I can't see how anyone can take seriously such an absurd tale.Are you detecting shades of Rocky here? Yes, so was I. So not only is the storyline preposterous, it is unoriginal as well. The only thing that saves the film is the emotionally stirring scenes near the end as the boxer deals with tragic events that afflict her life. They are excellently acted and brought a lump to my throat. However, not even that can offset the ever-predicable and toe-curling subplots about the loud-mouth bully being put in his place and the no-hoper who just never gives up. You don't need me to elaborate on those subplots any more - you've seen them in a thousand other films. Aren't audiences getting tired of this by now? Where's the originality? Where's the realism?",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
After Thoughts,"Phew! My gosh! What a movie. As a viewer you feel like you just got off an emotional roller-coaster. Clint Eastwood did an amazing job directing and acting in this movie. The range of emotion show from Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, and Morgan Freeman is astounding. And the shot and writing for this movie are tuned perfectly. This has to be one of, if not my favorite boxing movie ever. I learn more and more that Clint Eastwood's movies that he directed are becoming some of my favorites of all time. I cannot recommend this movie more, I give it my highest praises and it is definitely going on my list of top movies ever!",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
This Best Picture winner left me stunned.,"I just finished this movie and I am stunned. Million Dollar Baby must have the saddest ending in a movie that I have ever experienced. This is kind of ironic, considering the rest of the movie made me feel so good and excited.The movie may remind you of Rocky, which won Best Picture as well, 28 years prior. While I do agree that this was the best of the nominees(though I have not seen Finding Neverland), I personally love The Passion of the Christ and Spider Man 2(by one spot) a bit more.This stars Hilary Swank as Maggie, a poor waitress who struggles so much that she has to take hardly eaten steak home to eat for dinner.She asks Frankie, a trainer played by producer-director-composer Clint Eastwood, to train her. He refuses at first since she's a girl, but with the help of his friend, played by Morgan Freeman, he agrees.She gets good, but tragedy strikes, and Frankie, who grows to like her, has to make a very difficult choice.I have already mentioned my emotions while watching this movie. That pretty much summarizes what makes this movie so great. It put me through a ton of emotions, and the story was so well told.The ending made me tear up and cry a little, and few movies make me do this. Million Dollar Baby has the saddest ending since The Green Mile, assuming few sadder movies were made in the next 5 years.(Besides The Passion of the Christ, which came out earlier that year-though that makes me tear up throughout, so that doesn't count in this scenario.)As I watched the movie, I thought that this must be a true story-it seemed very realistic, and the kind of true story that would be adapted to film. But as I looked at the special features, I found out that it was fictional. Isn't amazing how great of a story humanity can tell to others?If I had to have one gripe about the movie, it would have to be something that may not apply to you. I have partial hearing loss, and it was hard to hear the actors most of the time, so I watched the movies with subtitles. Though that's a minor complaint.These aspects now makes this one of the best movies I have ever seen! Million Dollar Baby is a priceless masterpiece.4 quick cool movie facts I want to share:1. This was the first Best Picture winner to be released on HD DVD and Blu-ray.2.It was in theaters for 6.5 months.3.Roger Ebert also called this the best movie of the year.4. This is the 2nd Clint Eastwood movie to win Best Picture-the other is Unforgiven from 1992. Morgan Freeman stars in this, as well.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

An absolute masterpiece,"Million Dollar Baby (2004) is an Eastwood masterpiece that I recently rewatched for the first time in a long time on MAX. The storyline follows a desperate young lady and a boxing trainer who lost his contender and doesn't want to train females. The young lady convinces him that she's worth his time, thanks to some coaxing by a janitor that works at the gym. A bond is formed between the three individuals that will change their lives forever.This movie is directed by, and stars, icon Clint Eastwood (Unforgiven) and also stars Hillary Swank (P. S. I Love You), Morgan Freeman (Se7en), Jay Baruchel (Goon), Mike Colter (Luke Cage), Anthony Mackie (Avengers), Michael Peña (American Hustle) and Riki Lindhome (The Last House on the Left).This movie is an absolute gem in every way. The movie has a tremendous cast, narration and perfectly written dialogue. The storyline is unique with great subplots and unpredictable circumstances. You really get bought into the characters which makes them easy to root for and every scene more dramatic. The background music is perfectly selected and the ending is magnificent, no matter how sad it is.Overall, this is an absolute masterpiece and must see. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Good study from Eastwood,"Million Dollar Baby is arguably the most well-acted film of 2004 and the most compelling. It holds our attention almost all the way through with its passionate storytelling. Swank and Freeman are both entrancing in Oscar-winning efforts and Eastwood is no less enthralling as Swank's grizzled trainer. Eastwood does not focus on as much the boxing itself, but the nature of the characters that participate in the sport. The only flaw is the murky, strange ending that does not sum up the film in the way our emotions want. However, 95% of this is excellent movie-making that challenges the viewer to think, not just watch and listen.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

MILLION DOLLAR BABY is a good movie --- not great --- but good,"I think MILLION DOLLAR BABY is a good movie --- not great --- but good. There were many moments of the film that were outlandish - especially some of the boxing sequences. Some of them were as unrealistic as you'd find in a ROCKY sequel.However, Swank and Freeman gave excellent performance and some of the dialogue was quite good. Eastwood, on the other hand, come across too bland at times. The last church scene, IMO, was were he was at his best. As for his directing, Eastwood did a good solid job.The film does suffer from inconsistent pacing and some emotionally manipulative sequences.All in all, I'd give the film a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Very underwhelming,"I saw this movie yesterday after seeing all the acclaim and boy, was I disappointed. There are many implausible plot lines, and frankly who needs another boxing movie about man/woman reaching glory by winning boxing matches. Many reviews stated that the boxing theme was minor but I didn't find that to be the case at all. After Rocky and Raging Bull, the turf has been covered. I thought that Eastwood eclipsed with Mystic River and this was a letdown, same with Hillary Swank who was more interesting in Boys Don't Cry. I never saw Los Angeles come off more like a rural hick town than in this film. There is this relationship with Eastwood and his daughter that is mystery estrangement and it is never resolved. The pacing was also very slow. This has to be the weakest of the Oscar contenders this year.",4.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Triumph for 74 year old Director and Star......CLINT EASTWOOD,"Take a sports drama and litter it with every cliché in the book then let the great Clint Eastwood surprise the audience as he manages to deliver a highly satisfying, original, thought provoking film. Despite containing some of the most realistic fight sequences I've seen, this is not a film about boxing, it's about loneliness, redemption and achievement, something that brings together three characters played by Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman.Eastwood displays his emotional side something he touched upon in UNFORGIVEN, IN THE LINE OF FIRE & BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY, but here he excels in one of the most moving performance's of his career, he directs with pace and flair but never over indulges with style. He also composed the beautiful score, a talent many movie fans don't know about(he also wrote the theme alongside regular collaborator Lennie Niehaus for UNFORGIVEN).Freeman is excellent (as usual) in a role not too dissimilar to that in SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and let's not forget the lovely MILLION DOLLAR BABY herself Hilary Swank, she gained an Oscar five years ago for BOYS DON'T CRY but never achieved star status...hopefully this movie will change that.This is as good as mainstream Hollywood can get and Legend Eastwood doesn't need big budgets to please a Cinema audience and with his 75th birthday in May approaching he shows no signs of stopping.",,Anonymous,Drama

Eastwood's Finest Film - A Future Classic,"I'm not a fan of drama's, I watch film for escapism. But I do make few exceptions and in rare cases they pay off, Million Dollar Baby is a fine example of this, it tells the story of a young woman who has a big dream to become the best at boxing. Sounds cliché doesn't it? Yet, Eastwood gives a lesson in film-making, driven by a performance from Swank that has been burned into my mind for the foreseeable future. Swank's character Maggie Fitzgerald slowly grows into a capable fighter, but the fights feel like the side-story in this film about discovering how hard life can hit you(quoting Rocky here seems fitting). I cannot remember a film ending that hit me harder, I wept for a good few minutes and considering I'm not a fan of drama's and am pretty dried eyed, this should give you an idea of what to expect. But nothing will prepere you for this journey through the vivid and heart-breaking story of a young girl trying to make it. Supported by a strong cast including the man behind the scenes and legendary Freeman. This film is a must watch for anyone asking ""how could it be worse?"" Eastwood is about to give you a run for your money. I feel like movies like this will be missed, Cinemas are being flooded with superhero films, makes me wonder, Has the film industry taken a wrong turn? Sure an action-flick is great escape, but it feels so hollow when you see perferfomences like Swanks. Imagine being a fan of film and not knowing about this? I envy you, theres few films that gave me the whiplash that MDB did. Fewer even with a lead that gave me goosebumps. It's a shame that Swanks talent's are being wasted lately, as she's an actress that deserves better.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Very Heavyweight.,"Sometimes it's hard, years after a particular Oscar season to look back and assess why a particular film did so well. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is, for me, one such film. Though there are some aspects to admire, much of it feels like a fairly overt attempt to tick off ""Oscar worthy"" boxes.Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) runs a boxing gym with Eddie Dupree (Morgan Freeman). Reluctantly, Frankie agrees to train and then manage Maggie (Hilary Swank) a tenacious and prodigious boxer. Eventually the pair work their way up to a Las Vegas Title Fight which has fateful consequences for the pair.Questionable politics aside, Clint Eastwood deserves his legendary status in Hollywood and though ""Million Dollar Baby"" doesn't come close to matching ""Unforgiven"", his talent at framing a shot, and use of lighting is evident. His performance in front of the character her is a little.. one note, and brooding, misanthrope does start to wear then - even when the actions of the conclusion start to weigh heavily on him. His verbal sparring with Morgan Freeman is nice though sometimes crosses the line from funny to bizarre. I wasn't massively impressed with Hilary Swank's performance either, though her commitment to the role was admirable, the rest of the execution felt a bit forced. (I know she won the Oscar, and who am I to criticise, but still, in my opinion).The Casting Agent did a really good job though, with early performances from Mike Colter, Margo Martindale and the MCU double bill of Anthony Mackie and Michael Pena. The trouble is, apart from Colter's Willie who serves the plot by making Frankie wary of committing to training again, the rest of the gym are just there to fill time, with a unresolved B- Story that doesn't serve the film's narrative in any way.Did I enjoy ""Million Dollar Baby""? No, how could I? How could anyone given the miserable conclusion? But did I appreciate it - somewhat. I had heard a little of the ending before seeing the film, so it wasn't as much of a bait and switch as it would have been at the time. It has, to be fair, stayed with me for the 24 hours after seeing it, but I'd also don't feel like I'll ever want to sit down and watch it again.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Clint Eastwood Shines, Hilary Swank Does Her Thing","I'm not the biggest fan of this movie. It's like many other sports films: the underdog tries to make it big. But the beauty of this film is in Clint Eastwood. Like his later role in ""Gran Torino"", he plays an older man set in his ways and somewhat prejudiced who loosens up and becomes a hero of sorts. Morgan Freeman is also great, but when isn't he? Hilary Swank is not one of my favorite actresses, but she played this role well and I cannot see anyone else doing it. Someone mentioned that Sandra Bullock (for example) would have killed this role and therefore the movie. Absolutely right.There was much to like in this one, like the featherweight who wanted to be the champion... but as well as it held my attention and was well-paced and acted, I wouldn't say it was a masterpiece. Clint Eastwood is a fine director, but for me he didn't get the power out of this one that he did with ""Torino"".",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Cliché-packed amateur production,"I never cease to be amazed at how easily manipulated the American public can be: witness the rave reviews and awards lavished on Eastwood-directed movies: that pretentious excuse for a Western, ""Unforgiven,"" got the Oscar for Best Picture for Goodness' sake! As for MDB, its plot is full of clichés and inconsistencies that leave thinking viewers frustrated. (Judging from some of the reviews on this site it seems that I'm not the only one to have been mostly underwhelmed by this Eastwood amateurish confection.)

Is this moving really about boxing?,"I must begin by confessing that I hate boxing. So I'll make this comment notwithstanding that. Well but is this movie really about boxing? I don't think so, I mean, in my opinion boxing is here a mere pretext to tell a story about love, friendship, dedication, will strength and fighting spirit for an aim. The main character is a boxer by chance as she could be a soccer player, a singer, a dancer or a pianist. And this is also the story of a false hard hearted guy who loses a daughter and meets another to whom he can give his fatherly love and get it returned. This movie is made with a, shall we say, atrocious realism both visual and psychological and the acting performers do their best to express it. The outcome, though caused by a fortuitous (or not?) fact, inserts itself totally in the atmosphere created by the two main characters (or three if we consider that the old ex-boxer is also a catalyst of the whole process of events, playing a fundamental part in the consciousness of the other two and acting somehow like their counterpoint). I think we are perhaps in presence of one of the best 2004 movies if not the best one.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
This is Eastwood's mature vision,"Beautifully written, produced, acted; Eastwood continues to grow, and it's great to see that. May he continue to be the maverick who takes on stuff like this and do things few dare to do.You can't ask for better; a movie which says everything that needs to be said about the choice to make the search for truth one that involves a fight. For Dunn, life is a fight. Contenders for claims to the divine must run through searing heat, so the dross burns off and what comes out the other side is pure gold. This movie pushes us right into the volcano. Do we come out with or without hope that this process produces something ultimately beautiful? Sorry, but this movie declines to convince or reassure. That is for each of us to decide at the movie's end, just as we will have to assess at our lives' ends. If that sounds like a ""stone bummer, man,"" then don't watch this film.This movie joins others, like Fellini's Nights of Cabiria, that dare to leave us with no clear and pat conclusions about the fates of the protagonists. In the end, the real issue involves our feelings as we face life's challenges--and deal with the outcomes, both desired and undesired.

These two guys are the best of the older actors that are still around. AS for Swank, I don't believe I've ever really cared for any of her movies, good or bad...but this film was great for her.

Not a knockout but a solid effort,"In some ways Million Dollar Baby is as simple as movies get. It's a story about three people. And one of the three seems to be there really just to tell you some things you otherwise might not know about the other two. The two principals in question are aging boxing trainer Frankie Dunn, played by Clint Eastwood who also directs, and the aspiring female boxer he will soon train, Maggie Fitzgerald, played wonderfully by Hilary Swank. The only other character of any great significance, played by Morgan Freeman, is Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris. Scrap, a former boxer himself, now helps Frankie with the operation of his rather seedy boxing gym. But perhaps more importantly for the film, Scrap serves as the narrator who tells us things about Frankie and Maggie that otherwise would have taken too long to flesh out. We get to know Frankie and Maggie as much through what Scrap tells us about them as by what we see them doing ourselves.The three main characters are brought together by boxing but it's really not a boxing movie. It's more about the life's journey of Maggie Fitzgerald and how Frankie, a man near the end of his own journey, will help her fulfill her destiny. Maggie and Frankie's unlikely partnership drives the movie forward and Swank and Eastwood each do a great job in bringing their characters to life. As the determined and somewhat naive underdog Swank shines. Very few actresses would have been able to handle the emotion and the physicality of this role. Swank absolutely nails it. Eastwood's character has a lot bubbling under the surface and initially we're not really sure if we should like this guy. But despite his initial misgivings (he is very emphatic in stating that he doesn't train girls), Maggie brings out the best in him. They have an unusual but undeniably strong bond and they go on a fascinating journey together.The story is an intriguing one, the characters are compelling and the acting, from Swank especially, is excellent. But Million Dollar Baby seems to lack a certain energy driving the film forward. For much of the film it seems we're just biding time waiting for the inevitable climactic fight. And that climactic fight? Well, it's how shall we say, quite interesting, and certainly puts a different spin on all that has come before. Part of the charm of movies is in delivering the unexpected but I'm not sure how many will be charmed by the climactic events here. In the end, Million Dollar Baby is certainly powerful, thought-provoking and full of emotion. No all-time classic but a fine story well worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Great,"Million Dollar Baby (2004)**** (out of 4)It's rather amazing to see how much great work Clint Eastwood has done over the past fifteen years. It's so great in fact that I think you really need to take a closer look at him as being one of the greatest filmmakers of recent decades. I certainly don't think this is one of the greatest films ever made but it's certainly a revalation in today's terms since Eastwood has the balls to do something the audience doesn't expect. I knew something happened at the end but I was able to not have it spoiled by reading nothing about the film. I went back and read some of the controversy that came up and found it all quite silly. I guess when people have nothing better to do they start stuff up. In the discussion thread here I saw a lot of people bashing the white trash family in the film and I found it rather funny that their locations had them in states not really known for ""white trash"". Being from KY and having to hear these jokes, I must say this is one of the most realistic examples of this type of family. In fact, I'd say it was the most realistic and there certainly wasn't any cartoonish moments or over the top moments. The performances by Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman are right on the mark. As with Mystic River, it's good to throw the CGI in the toilet and see a movie being carried by great acting.As for the ending, again bless Eastwood.",,Anonymous,Drama
This is one of those films that's worth much more than a million dollars. How does it hold up today?,"""Million Dollar Baby"" (2004), this is one of those movies that epitomize the meaning of unpredictable. On top of that, it has found a spot on my top ten all-time saddest films list. ""Million Dollar Baby"" has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and also a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The plot is, a woman named Maggie is an amateur boxer who seeks the help of a reluctant trainer in the hopes of becoming a professional. It's about a simple as you can get, but for a story like this, it's warranted, as it allows for more character development. For the first half of the movie, it's kind of like a female version of ""Rocky"". Which, it kind of is, in a way. Then, there's a sudden twist that you will not see coming when you watch it. I certainly didn't expect it when it happened! That, of course made it all the more heartbreaking. I won't go into any further details about the plot, because I don't want to spoil anything for those of you who may not have seen it yet. But, let me warn you, that I suggest you have a box of tissues next to you for the second half of the movie and especially for the ending. That being said, I didn't cry when I first saw it. However, I suddenly felt my eyes water a little bit. That's saying quite a lot, especially from someone like me! If a film can make me almost cry, then it more than succeeded with it's execution. All of the acting is impeccable from the whole entire cast, they knock it out of the park! But, the best performances come from Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman. They do a sublime job with their respectable characters! The best acting though in this movie is from Hilary Swank, as Maggie. In my opinion, I think it's her greatest acting performance out of all the films she's starred in. Hilary Swank is a great actress, and this movie laments that a thousand-fold! Her acting, as well as the others in the main cast, makes you genuinely care about their characters and want them to succeed at the end. All of the sets/locations are beautiful and give the film a stunning atmosphere. The lighting, in particular is very good. It highlights the emotions to full extent in the more serious scenes and accentuates how each character is feeling. All of the special effects are perfect and still hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack is a masterpiece and sets the perfect tone for the storyline. Aside from being the director, Clint Eastwood also wrote and composed the film score for this movie! How about that? Talk about full control! ""Million Dollar Baby"" is, quite simply, a masterpiece. It's one of those films that will leave you speechless when you watch it for the first time, or however many times you see it. Even though I know what's going to happen, every plot twist and moment is still a shock and the ending still moves me. I'm giving this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Million Dollar Baby"", what are you waiting for? Go see it today! But, like I said, make sure that you have some tissues with you when you see it. I personally guarantee that it will most likely make you cry!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Clint is surely one of the greatest directors, actors to make movies","Clint Eastwood, one of the all-time most famous actors -- and directors -- has more than enough money where he could choose to pull the strings on block-buster, mindless action pictures, Ala Jerry Bruckheimer, or comic books. Or, hell, in his twilight years he could just lay back and enjoy his millions. But no. He has chosen instead to make quieter, lower-budget, heart-felt, character driven films like ""The Unforgiven"" ""True Crime"" ""Mystic River"" and now Million Dollar Baby. And the world is a better place for it. Eastwood uses his multiple talents to make films that have something valuable to say. In the emotionally powerful, Million Dollar Baby, he tells an allegorical tale of boxing to subtly express themes of hope, redemption, sacrifice, persistence, and belief in one's self. The movie emphasizes that failure is a more honorable and personally fulfilling trait than never having tried, while also frowning upon laziness and leeching off others. But see the movie and judge for yourself. I personally consider great films as the ones where I leave the theater with a better understanding of human nature, or a desire to improve the world by even a little bit.

Most of the movie plods along pleasantly enough, with shades of Shawshank in atmosphere but not a great deal to back it up. Then it rushes headlong through matters of real importance and my overall impression was somehow of cosy predictability. Given the nature of the subject matter (I won't spoil it for you, but as you may have heard the later part of the movie is not so cosy in content), this is both ironic and appalling!Million Dollar Baby is not a bad movie, and I did enjoy it, and Hollywood can do much worse, but don't rent it thinking you're getting a film of the year.Million Dollar Baby is also a great title for a movie, but not this one. They appear to have lifted it from either one of two pre-war features; I don't know.",4.0,Anonymous,Drama
Over-hyped and Overwrought,"""Million Dollar Baby"" takes the well worn boxing genre and turns it into so much mawkish manipulation. Though Hillary Swank gives a great performance, the story is painfully transparent. The use of the omniscient voice-over distracts from what is happening on the screen. Clint Eastwood airs out his limited selection of old catchers mitt expressions and Morgan Freeman is his typecast old self as the wizened presence with a hatful of aphorisms. This film covers no new ground and you might be left with a desire to approach the theater manager about a refund. When a film has the Oscar prognosticators panting only ten minutes after the film has opened, you may have seen a great film, or you may have been sold a bill of goods. If you can remove every boxing film cliché' from your brain before sitting down to watch, ""Million Dollar Baby"" might be the former. If not, carefully fold your money, and go see something with a little more creativity and depth.",,Anonymous,Drama
Million Dollar movie,"""Million Dollar Baby"" (2004) is a compelling drama that stands out for its emotional depth and strong performances. Directed by Clint Eastwood, who also stars alongside Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman, the film explores themes of perseverance, redemption, and the complexities of relationships. Swank's portrayal of a determined boxer is both gritty and heartfelt, earning critical acclaim. The film's narrative takes unexpected turns, offering a profound and often poignant look at the struggles and sacrifices involved in pursuing one's dreams. With its powerful storytelling and exceptional acting, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is both a gripping and moving cinematic experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
interesting to watch,"I only watched this movie today because I wasn't into women in boxing, but now I regret not seeing it earlier! Hilary Swank's performance is outstanding, and Clint Eastwood adds his unique touch. Morgan Freeman's narration adds depth to the characters' emotions. Another thrilling action genre that you need to check ..The ending is well-known, but I won't spoil it for new viewers like me.

Definitely worth watching for a deeper understanding of boxing and self-reflection! 🎬🥊 What do you think about movies that challenge your perspective?",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Masterful film!,"I confess. I didn't think I would like a movie about women's boxing. However, Million Dollar Baby managed to keep me glued to the TV until the end. End is the right word, even if it's a finale that I would have wanted to be different. I would have wanted a more typical American movie ending and less of a Greek tragedy. But that's not how it turned out. And it's better that way. Boxing is just an excuse to tackle delicate themes such as life, death, and relationships. Great actors for an Oscar-worthy performance. Overall, a masterful film, one of those to be included in the list of the most beautiful films of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A very good work.,"In general, I like Clint Eastwood's films. Million dollar baby is a sincere and realistic work. There is a small, strange story with two strange people. A boxing coach with such dedication and a soft soul covered by ruggedness, and a girl with such determination to become a champion. The story becomes unique with the characterizations of Dunn and Maggie. There are bad people in the story but they are not purposefully exposed to be 'villainous'. Her mom and sister were not that much loving as a normal poor family with a bad/dead daddy and living in bad surroundings expect to be.The main good thing is the story line and the script; both of them with sincerity and dedication. Next ones are the acting, music and photography and in fact direction of Clint. I wondered about Clint Eastwood's music. It was very simple. I don't know it involved any mind boggling composing of tunes. It was just plain but it was more than enough. In this modern world with readily perverted, what-the-heck kind of minds, this kind of plain good simple-natured story and characters might look odd. It did (that is why these Oscars I guess). I loved this film. It's like a perfect little short story (of two hours time though). Many criticizing comments read Morgan Freeman has nothing to play. But as I see it, Freeman adds more depth into the story. Watch it if you can go with slow-moving but strong stories.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

"One of Eastwood's Best, But A Very Different Film From Him","If there was a Clint Eastwood film that proves how great of a director and actor he is at the same time, this movie is it. This movie really extends his acting chops. It's one of his best performances in the likes of ""Unforgiven "" and the under looked ""Honky Tonk Man"". Hilary Swank was impressive as the leading lady. As always, Morgan Freeman was excellent. There was fine support, especially from Jay Baruchel, who has really grown since ""Undeclared"". What also makes this movie is the great story line. As the movie develops, you realize that Eastwood and Swank develop a non sexual relationship, in a way as father and daughter do. The movie ends in tragedy, but that just makes the movie better for me. This is the best picture of 2004, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.",,Anonymous,Drama
A Perfect Film,"After having watched this movie for probably the tenth time, I feel compelled to shout my love for it from a mountain top (or at least, from the IMDb commentary page)! ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a masterpiece in all possible respects. The brilliant screenplay could in no way be improved upon. The story is beautiful, gritty, sweet, tragic, warmly funny at times, and profound. The method of delivery as the story is written (which we find out at the end), is not merely icing on the cake, it's like lightning striking a crate of fireworks stored in the viewer's heart.The acting is impeccably understated, as it should be. I watched it this last time trying to imagine how it would have played if the lines were said differently, by anyone else. (I'm a movie dork, I know.) It could have come off as really schmaltzy and melodramatic if the actors hadn't been so very sensitive, and the direction hadn't been right on key.Speaking of direction, I suppose it's time we mentioned one Sir (he must be a ""Sir"" by now, mustn't he? Dude's an artistic genius after all...) Clint Eastwood. Not only did he bring the ideal combination of crotchetiness and underlying tenderness to the roll of ""Frankie"", aka ""Boss"", with his acting, not only did he direct (gently--I've heard he's the favorite director of all actors) the gifted Oscar-Winners Hilary Swank and (the incomparable) Morgan Freeman to do their finest, he actually composed the emotionally resonant soundtrack!I find myself torn between wanting to prostrate (not prostate, that's something else altogether) myself before Mr. Eastwood, and wanting to slap him upside the head for being so darn talented... Bastard. (Just kidding!) My only disappointment was that he didn't win the Oscar for Best Actor.This film is not for the faint of heart. I went in thinking it would be like ""Rocky"". It was, for the majority of it... then it took a most unexpected dramatic turn. I loved ""Rocky"", but ""Million Dollar Baby"" is an entirely different animal: an animal to be reckoned with, and an animal to be loved.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"""Million Dollary Baby"" - a knockout","I'm amazed at the strength of this movie, ""Million Dollar Baby."" I'm also amazed at how far its director and lead actor, Clint Eastwood, has progressed as a filmmaker. (It's easy to see that his ""Dirty Harry"" days are way behind him.) Since 1992's ""Unforgiven,"" we've seen an insightful, straightforward way of storytelling from the actor-turned-director, who has developed the most unique talent of any filmmaker alive today, which is to understand his characters and present them in a significant, but not overstated fashion that brings about their emotions, pains, and successes. His latest film, adapted by screenwriter Paul Haggis from stories printed in ""Rope Burns: Stories from the Corner"" by the late F.X. Toole, searches the souls of three people in the boxing ring of life. The first is old and tired gym owner Frankie Dunn (Eastwood), the type of world-weary character Eastwood specializes in, who knows the ring inside-out and reads poetry in his spare time. The second is hillbilly (white trailer trash?) Maggie Fitzgerald (a knockout powerhouse played by Oscar-winner Hilary Swank), who thinks boxing is the only way out of her job as a waitress, which she has been doing since the tender age of 13. Frankie reluctantly takes her under his wing and their path leads her on an escapable course with destiny. She trains hard, sweats hard, knocks out the competition in one round for several bouts (a feat that embarrasses the daylights out of certain managers), and a chance at a title shot if she can unseat the brutal Billie ""The Blue Bear"" (Lucia Rijker). She makes a complete turnaround in character, going from bright-eyed rookie to seasoned professional, and the way the film tracks her progress is relayed to us beautifully. Lastly, there is Scrap (Morgan Freeman), who is also the story's narrator. Scrap is sincere in his narration in yet another world-weary manner like Eastwood and doesn't twist or play with his words to make points. As a former fighter who Frankie once trained, he's blind in one eye, out of the ring, but possess the wisdom worthy of one to tell a story like Frankie and Maggie's. It's not hard to see why Roger Ebert showered it with praise; nothing in his review convinced me he was lying. The raw power of ""Million Dollar Baby"" lies in the performances and straightforward narrative of the story, all of which I described earlier. It won four Oscars and two Golden Globes, though sadly enough the emotional score that Eastwood himself composed didn't win anything. This is the best movie about boxing and boxers I've seen since ""Rocky"" (1976). But right there is the distinction. ""Million Dollar Baby"" isn't so much about boxing and winning the title as it is a close inspection of the relationship of three different people. ""Rocky"" is about that one shot, that one chance to make something of yourself; this film is about living those dreams. ""Million Dollar Baby"" - a knockout.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"A much more poignant, heartfelt Rocky","I absolutely hate boxing - I find it to be a truly inhumane sport (it's not even a sport; it's people inflicting maximum pain and damage on each other), and I always saw Hilary Swank as just a pair of silicone implants and a horsey smile. But I AM a sucker for films in which the characters (reluctantly) team up to accomplish a goal, whether it is a heist or winning a boxing title.Combine this with the heartwarming, mandatory Morgan Freeman narrative of the film and I have endless affection for it. Well, not endless perhaps - but it is a well-crafted quality drama with superb acting performances and exciting boxing games. Clint Eastwood as grumpy veteran boxing trainer who reluctantly takes on Maggie (Hilary Swank) has got to be one of the most likable characters in film. There is also quite a bit of humour in the first half of the film when he begins coaching her. I love it how he is never disturbed by Maggie's stubbornness, just sort of exasperated.The film delicately sees these two personalities juxtaposed with each other to overcome initial difficulties and in the end, develop a strong father-and-daughter like bond. It sounds corny, but it translates very well on screen and I do not remember the last time I was as engrossed in a character's struggle as I was with Maggie's, which tells me Million Dollar Baby is doing something right. Very right.When Paul Haggis' (of the horrorshow Crash) name popped up in the end credits as screenwriter, I was quite stunned but it made sense later on - because the writing of Million Dollar Baby is very explicit and spelled-out for audiences. That said, it is not as bad as Crash. Had I known Haggis had written it, I probably would have avoided it for a while longer in fear of being met by a blinking sign over a character's head that says ""THIS PERSON IS SAD"" .As far as sport-themed films go, Million Dollar Baby is a grand accomplishment that projects so much heart that I must have cried nearly all the way through the second half.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
What?! No Nudity?!,"I finally had an opportunity to view this incredible gem of a movie and now know what all the positive buzz was about. It's so refreshing to see a film built on story and acting actually win the Best Picture Oscar. It's even more gratifying to see Hollywood, the ultimate Land of Youth, honor a seventy-something year old director. And what a bargain. At the cost of a mere $18 million you know right up front that money wasn't thrown at it to make it more appealing to today's typically shallow movie going public. Usually the first 20 million or so goes directly into lining the pockets of some lousy, over-rated star who's supposed to supersede actual creativity in order to guarantee a decent box office crowd. I'd love to shake the hand of the gutsy Hollywood execs who green-lighted this one. Some of the best decision making Tinsletown has ever seen. No gun play, no fireballs, no CGI showboating and NO NUDITY. Not even nudity ""intregal to the plot line!"" and yet it actually succeeded in creatively topping every other film of 2004. How's THAT for bucking established trends? Here's to hoping that more films follow form now that there's proof that substance does mean something after all. So if you haven't yet seen ""Million Dollar Baby"", give it a shot.

"Maybe, ""Thousand Dollar Baby?""","I see more than 100 movies a year in the theaters, and with all the over-hype of this, I expected something truly great. Well, if you read through all these reviews, it'll explain the plot, so I won't waste time and re-do it, but I will say this...this film is a major disappointment. Considering Eastwood's last, great film, Mystic River, I expected something in that caliber. There is nothing in this film that holds up to Mystic. No, this film is not a complete loss, it does have good moments, but no great, or significant moments. It's all huff and bluff, but nothing more. The performances are fine, but not spectacular. And the script has to be one of the poorest scripts of a major film this year. It is juvenile and amateurish and far from the caliber Eastwood should be working with. It takes from classic great films like ""Raging Bull"" and ""Shawshank' to name a few, but adds nothing to them and can't even match the brilliance of either of those truly classic films. Eastwood should have known better, but this is obviously a director out of his league and not fully comprehending what he wanted to do or say. When the narration fails under the weight of the great Morgan Freeman, you know you are in trouble. Swank does well, but her role is not terribly complex. I think back to the great Imelda Staunton, in 2004's Best Film ""Vera Drake"" .Now that was great acting!! And a truly great film. This film will receive a lot of Oscar noms and probably win some, but it's a sad commentary when a film like this is so over-rated and people seem to buy into it. Roger Ebert called this, the best film of the year, but he, like so many others, seem to be star struck and not really paying close attention to details, script, plotting or what is on the screen. I liked this film, well enough, don't mis-understand me. I'd give it a ""B"" on a scale from A-F. But ""B"" is hardly what I expect from Eastwood, and far from what I expected reading all these over-praising reviews. I have the real sense that many viewers, who listen to the hype, will leave the theater sad, disappointed, and wondering what all the chatter was all about. So do I.",,Anonymous,Drama

The acting, especially Hilary Swank is superb, including Freeman, who is in supporting this time (who also won). The music was haunting but great, there's offbeat humor, and some of the most important lessons everyone should learn. The only probably with this movie was the last thirty minutes of the film.

He is really a good director and approach his films as raw(real) as possible. As far as I can recall, when he directs films, the actors that are involved has been given citations for their acting.

It is a mature and realistic story that seems so original and interesting that you can't help but admire those involved with it.As far as boxing films are concerned this is definitely on par with Rocky and Raging Bull- possibly the two most memorable ones of the genre for the last 30 years. They each tell a different story that works in its one way.Eastwood, Swank, Freeman and the rest of the supporting cast are outstanding and Paul Haggis' script contains plenty of memorable scenes between the characters and you really do get more and more involved as the story progresses.I urge you to see this moving film whenever you get the chance.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

One of the most moving films I've ever seen.,"I am writing this review on the afternoon of February 27th, a couple hours before the Academy Awards begin, and I really think that the Best Picture category is going to be mostly a contest between The Aviator and Million Dollar Baby, both of which are spectacular films, as are the rest of the nominees (Finding Neverland, Ray, and Sideways, in my order of preference). I caught this movie about a week ago at a theater a block from my house. The one thing that I really like about living in LA is that, especially at Oscar time, just about any movie nominated in any category is bound to still be playing somewhere, regardless of how long ago it was released.Except Best Animated Short Film, of course. I still think those never play anywhere.I have a feeling that Mystic River was passed over for the Best Picture award because of too much similarity to Clint Eastwood's outstanding 1999 film True Crime, and I had anticipated something in that general vein with Million Dollar Baby, if only because the appearance of the film is so similar. Eastwood has gone from making westerns to making one exceedingly dark film after another, and in this film he has succeeded like he never has in his storied career.Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, the owner of a pretty run-down boxing gym where hopefuls come to work out and get some training from him. It's the kind of gym from which you don't really expect to see many people rise to boxing stardom, so Frankie concentrates hard on one man that he's training, who has a chance at a title bout. It is during this time that Maggie (Hillary Swank) walks into the gym and starts calling him Boss, which he does not appreciate because, as he flatly tells her, ""I don't train girls.""Up to this point in the film the plot has not really revealed itself. We know we are watching a movie about boxing that's not really about boxing (a sports movie cliché that Million Dollar Baby brilliantly sidesteps) and that Maggie is more than likely going to turn into the brilliant boxer that Frankie has been looking for. But beyond that the movie could go in a hundred different directions, and it promptly goes exactly where you didn't think it was going to go.This could very easily have become a quickly forgettable sports film that disappeared into video store obscurity like even the good sports films like Miracle and Mystery, Alaska seem to have done, but by the end of the movie it has gone in such an original direction and given the audience such an emotional workout that, on my way out of the theater I saw people leaning against the handrail. This movie is so powerful that you have to rest after you see it.Frankly, given how violent some of these sports movies are, especially ones like this, it amazes me that no other ones have gone as far as Million Dollar Baby does. The boxing scenes are thrilling to watch, even providing good comic relief as Maggie consistently knocks girls out in the first round and then looks sheepishly over at Frankie in her corner, who has instructed her not to knock them out so fast because it's getting so no one wants to put their boxer in the ring with her. He ends up having to bribe managers.The conflict comes from the fact that Maggie is desperate for a title fight. She has come from a trailer in middle America where she worked as a waitress for something like 17 years, and she knew that she would never do anything else until she got herself out of there on her own. Her family certainly was not going to help. My God man, I could not believe those people. She was uneducated and unskilled, she didn't even know how to box but she had the determination and the motivation to learn, and learn she certainly did.The problem is that one of Frankie's past trainees who managed to get a title fight was Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris (played in the movie by Morgan Freeman), who not only lost the fight but also was knocked blind in one eye. By the end of the movie, by the way, I like to think that Eddie may have considered changing his nickname to Eddie ""110"" Dupris. Frankie blames himself and he doesn't want to have another fighter injured. An honorable feeling, but it clashes with Maggie's goals, for whom not getting a chance to a title fight means she'll have to go back to being a waitress, which to her is nothing more than waiting to die. The interaction between the three characters is some of the best I've seen in years. And I've seen a lot of movies in years.I am reminded of Friday Night Lights, which came out in late 2004 and was hailed as the best sports movie ever made, a bold statement that inspired me to eventually watch it. Fairly entertaining movie, but the ludicrous statement that it's the greatest sports movie ever made becomes even more ludicrous if you consider Million Dollar Baby to be a sports movie. This is one of the great films in all of film history. Do NOT miss it.And with that, it's almost 4 o'clock. I'm going to go up to Hollywood Blvd. and see if I can catch a glimpse of Clint Eastwood.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Doesn't hit the hype.,"I just saw Million Dollar Baby on HBO last night and I must say it doesn't live up to the hype. Is it a good movie? Definitely an achievement for Clint, but it is not one of the greatest movies of all time. The acting is certainly superb, I can't deny that. If you want to be incredibly sad and hurt, this is the movie for you though. It is a tear jerker for sure but where's the creativity? Sure it's interesting but movies are supposed to innovative and creative as well as entertaining. This movie just goes for gritty drama and relies way to much on it's actors to make it. A movie must have more than a line up of great actors to make it great. While the premise touches the heart and then rips depression into your heart, it doesn't have the qualities to be the best of all time. It's just missing that certain creativity to stand out. Unlike Pulp Fiction or Taxi Drive or the Godfather or A Clockwork Orange, this movie will be forgotten with the rest of the Oscar winning dramas. While a good movie, doesn't fulfill the hype, and I found myself sadder at the end of My Dog Skip than this one. 6/10 for acting.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

Worth Every Dollar!,"Clint Eastwood is always at his best. This movie in my opinion tops ""UNFORGIVEN"", hands down. Yet, this is ""UNFORGIVEN's"" equal. Hilary Swank was great playing the heavily determined boxer. If it hadn't been for her tenacity, she would automatically given up. Morgan Freeman who worked with Eastwood in ""UNFORGIVEN"" is back with him. He's the more somber character in the movie, while Eastwood plays the harden one. Given the spot to teach Maggie the ropes of boxing wasn't all its cracked up to be, at least it was Frankie's first to teach a girl. Maggie(Swank) is nothing like her role Julie in ""The Next Karate Kid"". In that movie, she was surly. Frankie Dunn(Eastwood) is nothing like ""Dirty"" Harry, yet he displays some hardcore attitude in the movie which makes it watchable. To me, Maggie was the person who show determination, and receives inspiration from Frank, cause to him, he's reminds her of her late father. Since she has complete distrust in her family, she tries to give them what they needed, in return, they ended up being ungrateful, so why send them something? All they want to do is snuff it up. This movie also shows that even the gruffest of all grumps can have a softer side. And it's the first I've seen Eastwood get soft. AWWWWW! But Hey! This movie was no hype.

Average people can do incredible things,"I've been pretty moved with this movie. You don't even have to like boxe, I don't. If you like clever, beautiful dramas, I recommend it.First, the acting. It's really pleasant to see how the old trainer (Clint Eastwood) is so confused by Maggie (Hilary Swank) who won't listen to anything he says about getting another coach, going to another club. She just wants him as a coach and no one else. You can feel how Frankie is reluctant to train a girl, but then he starts to like her, and this is made in a very subtle acting. Both Eastwood and Swank are outstanding.Frankie and Maggie have deep psychology, especially Frankie who is really conflicted, and are well-developed throughout the movie. Maggie is an average waitress who realizes she can actually do something great by motivation. It's really interesting to see average people evolving but not much but pure willingness. She stands up to Frankie, it looks like he doesn't really have a choice, she's so stubborn !Photography is beautiful as well, close shots emphasizing drama, not taking risks but mastering the manual in a nutshell.Now what's wrong. Some really random scenes disturb the narration. They even talk about socks for a WHOLE scene, and it's not presented like it's supposed to be funny, or philosophical or anything, it's just socks, really.About the weird, retarded boxing guy : this is SO badly written. It looks like he is not finished as a character, that he should be in another movie or something. In 2 hours, scenes about him spawn randomly. This serves no purpose.Ending's great because it doesn't follow expectations about your average boxing movie.TLDR; not flawless, but still one of the best dramas, I recommend.

It has a decent script, good acting, and a surprisingly atmospheric soundtrack.Film critic Roger Ebert defended this movie by saying it not about boxing, it is about people. While that is true to a point, a lot of this film is about boxing and a large chunk of this film shows people boxing. The first 2/3 of the film is almost like Rocky except the acting and dialog is much better. The professional film critics have all agreed not to talk about the last third of the film except to say ""it takes a dark turn."" If you don't like depressing films, you should skip this one.Overall, I gave this film a 8/10 rating. It's really good but it's a downer and it's a boxing movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"A brilliant exploration of love, loss, and death","""Million Dollar Baby"" is on its surface a story about a female boxer and the aging fight manager and gym owner who trains her, which might lead one to think of it as sort of a female version of ""Rocky."" But it is much more. At its core this film is a brilliant exploration of love, loss, and death. Clint Eastwood proved again with this film that he is one of the great American directors, in a class with his hero, John Ford. Under his direction both Hillary Swank and Morgan Freeman won well deserved Oscars and Eastwood himself won two more for Best Picture and Best Director. Finally, Paul Haggis was nominated for the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar.No movie is perfect and ""Million Dollar Baby"" is no exception. Many of its characters are cartoonish characterizations, used as props for the more fully developed manager Frankie, played by Eastwood, His fighter, Maggie, played by Swank, and ""Scrap,"" Frankie's faithful friend and employee, played by Freeman. Maggie's hillbilly family, the brutish fighter, who Maggie fought for a championship, and a couple of the hangers on in Frankie's gym are examples of the less than believable characters in the film.But don't be put off by these overdrawn characters, for they are merely props designed to illustrate the relationships among Frankie, Maggie, and Scrap, who are fully realized and entirely believable. Frankie and Maggie come to love one another as the father and daughter each has lost. Although Scrap and Frankie are each other's dearest friend, each recognizes the weaknesses of the other. These relationships are used to dramatize the anguish of a moral dilemma and the triumph of the human spirit in the face of great odds. Not to be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
I Remember Rowdy Yates.............,"I've watch Clint Eastwood on TV and film nearly all my life - and I've watched him become the full-rounded actor/director he is today. He hasn't tried to stay with all-action hero as he's got older, and a good decision that's been. Now he is capable of turning out a small masterpiece like this. I don't like boxing, but this movie held me enthralled. All the actors played their parts wonderfully well. Miss Swank was totally believable, and Eastwood and Freeman bickering relationship sets the film off perfectly. The fight scenes are well filmed and I found myself wincing as each punch landed. I won't spoil the film for by giving anything away, but I suspect the Eastwood/Swank scenes at the end will challenge the hardest of hearts. Please, even if you don't like boxing, go and see this. You won't regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Emotional Knock-Out ...,"""Million Dollar Baby"" is undoubtedly the most acclaimed movie of 2004. It has often been referred by movie critics as a cinematic come-back to a more traditional film-making, like the dark and gripping Hollywood underdog stories of the 30's and 40's, a comparison that has been made for ""Rocky"" in its time.""Million Dollar Baby"" is a film of a few characters that yet constitute a solid and powerful acting ensemble. But has Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman ever gave a disappointing performance? Even Hillary Swank who won the Oscar for Best Actress, is totally diluted in her role as Maggie Fitzgerald, the white trash Southern girl whose only dream in life is to become a professional boxer. 'Dream' is too vague a word, 'reason to keep faith in this world' is more appropriate. And faith is a redundant theme in the story, faith as a strong belief in life's driving forces, including ours. It's definitely an underdog story, but told with great respect to the viewers.Like its glorious 'underdog' predecessor, ""Rocky"", ""Million Dollar Baby"" restrains all the emotions until finally imploding during a poignant and heart-breaking third act. The first ones consist on building relationships until their reason-to-exist within the story emotionally bloom. Clint Eastwood is Frankie Dunn, the hardened boxing trainer and Morgan Freeman, his assistant Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris, an ex-athlete whose dead eye symbolize other unconcealed wounds in his heart. Frankie also has demons to exorcise, and the film never tries to hide them. We understand it's about a daughter life has taken away from him, that he tries to find some meaning about God, harassing a priest with pointless questions ... that would take all their significance at the end.It's also easy to see that Maggie would complete Frankie, that he's going to help her as much as she will. It takes time before he takes the crucial decision to train her, maybe too much time but this is the mark of a film that cares more about characters than action. It's true sometimes, we can feel some events coming, when Frankie seems reluctant to engage his most valued protégé in Heavyweight championship; we know it's a matter of time before the man leaves him. Why? Because there has to be a gap in Frankie's heart, and relationships are all about ""filling gaps"". That's what Balboa said about his romance with Adrian, the same goes between Frankie and Maggie, in a father-and-daughter way. There is a mystery surrounding the Gaelic nickname he'll gave to her, the translation, if not surprising, is nonetheless poignant.That's the point, if you expect surprises, if you expect twists and new artistic licenses on the Sports genre, get ready for disappointment. ""Million Dollar Baby"" has the one flaw of Clint Eastwood's film: things are obvious and straight-forward, the bad guys are bad, the good ones are good. The way Maggie is treated by her opportunistic Welfare-cheating family, almost as villainous as the Big Blue Bear, is Eastwood's trademark, the depiction of a world in black and white. The film itself has a dark and shadowy atmosphere, conveying the nastiness and cruelty of a world, where the most precious moments have to keep intimate and secret. Rather than an exercise in obviousness, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a film that focuses on these intimate interactions, these moments where something sacred is transmitted: a secret, a declaration, a revelationAnd only Eastwood and Freeman can get away with their own clichés without ruining the film's intents. Yes, we have Morgan Freeman and his noble voice-over narration, translating into words what sometimes images can't express. Yes his gravely, deliberately monotonous voice, has a hypnotizing effect in our ears. Yes, Eastwood is groaning, grumpy character. Yes, the comparison with ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is inevitable, and it's impossible not to laugh sometimes at Eastwood's bad moods. But ""Million Dollar Baby"" has to be judged in its entirety, if you feel manipulated, ask yourself about the movie's pay-off, what does it speak to you? What does it say about life, about dreams? Sentimentality is one thing, but movie-making is an art-form whose merit can only be judged on its capacity to inspire emotions. And emotionally, the ending is satisfying.I feel like I would spoil the film if I go further in this review. I don't want to reveal the events that constitute the final third act, although the film's ranking among one of the greatest tear-jerker give enough hints not to expect a happy ending. But again, it's not about happiness, but about people meeting each other, and filling each other's gaps. It flirts with some obviousness, but to be sincere, I never felt it forced or stereotypical. I wish I could be smart and cynical enough to dismiss the film, and label it as propaganda, manipulation and dangerous influence, but the fact is that the three performance touched my heart. I understand the criticism, I even understand the hatred, but the film deeply moved me.The 'obviousness' is precisely what critics refer as renaissance of Hollywood tradition. Maybe in this era where psychological thrillers and non-linear narrative are overused by new talents, a movie like ""Million Dollar Baby"" that doesn't care about subtlety and nuance yet cares to tell a gripping and powerful story about three people, maybe this is the refreshment cinema asked for. And the fluid directing, the shadowy cinematography, the patient editing and the acting, contribute to a powerful movie, showing people evolving with time, people with dreams and hopes.Reviewing a film is a matter of genuine feelings and sincerity; I would be lying to myself if I started to criticize it for the sake of it. If I did, no matter how clever and hip I would sound, I wouldn't dare to review other movies. In all sincerity, I loved ""Million Dollar Baby"" and it's indeed one of Clint Eastwood's best works.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Dreams, Hopes and Loss, Million Dollar Baby is a sure winner","Million Dollar Baby was watched by myself and my mum just last night. Between us we knew nothing of boxing or the world that lived within its grasp, so we were anxious of the outcome of a boxing movie that had fantastic reviews. But Clint Eastwood didn't let us down. Million Dollar proved an insightful, honest and beautifully captured picture. With top-notch performances all round especially from Hillary Swank getting Best Lead Female Role in a film at the Oscars and Best Supporting Male Actor from Morgan Freeman also at the Oscars. The point is don't be discouraged from watching this film from your lack of boxing knowledge, this film perhaps from a point of view like myself is critical of the sport saying how barbaric and inhuman hitting each other is.

Riveting! Eastwood Just Gets Better With Age!,"What can I say that almost a thousand other comments haven't said? Clint Eastwood loves his craft. That's why his films are so good. He simply loves what he does........and it shows. He is a simple task-master but it works. What he lacks in talent he makes up for in grit, hard work, love of craft and determination for depiction of the truth in a natural way. He has a knack for simplicity and story-telling that is gripping and satisfying. He picks screenplays that are controversial and revolutionary and that require you as an audience to think and use your brain. He is not just there to entertain, though he always does that in large measure, but also to inform and to provoke one to thought - but rarely does he preach. He chooses themes that are often out of the mainstream, but can engage an audience so thoroughly with the universal emotions that we all share in our daily lives that he galvanizes large audiences into reactions that are at once massive but at the same time diverse in opinion. And that is precisely what Clint does here with great success. He does not give you a ""right or wrong"" to it. He just puts it on a platter for you to try it out and see for yourself what you think. I love Clint as an artist and so do many other people. This is a great film. Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman fit into their roles beautifully and Clint looks good too. Hilary and Clint do magic together on screen.Get this film and own it today. Watch it often and Enjoy! One of the Best Films ever made and perhaps Clint's finest!",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A solid but really mixed and ultimately unsatisfying effort,"The first two thirds of this film were excellent, with very good boxing/training action and lively performances from Swank and Freeman, and Eastwood even cracking a joke or two. The last third, when the melodrama hits, it hits like a tornado that sucks all the air out of the room and neglects to fill the vacuum. This movie was saved by the acting, but it was fairly chock full of clichés, and the fact that she walked into the gym supposedly after winning a fight throwing punches that off-kilter gave it a believability gap that took a while to get over. If they had started the film without her having stated she had won a fight, the story wouldn't have changed much (well, the clichés would have been a tad more obvious) and my believability would not have been so challenged for the first half hour.The last third of the film, where the well-known controversy exists, is incredibly long and tedious even in comparison to other melodramas. Without the ending, I would have given it an eight or nine for the lively Swank performance that, like Sylvester Stallone in the first Rocky film, took an old fashioned formula and made something really great out of it. The ending, however, dragged that all the way down to a six. I don't think I could watch it again without turning it off after that key defining event, but if I did, I'd end up watching a much more enjoyable movie. The movie had heart up until that point, but then it sold its soul.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

You guys watch TOO MUCH REALITY TV. Turn on TCM once in awhile and learn about art and cinema and real film making (e.g. Seven Samuri, Doctor Zhivago).

One of Hollywood's Best Ever Films!,"Note: Actors names are used instead of their character's names in the film.""Million Dollar Baby"" (2004) Directed by: Clint Eastwood Starring:Hillary Swank, Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman**** Excellent""Million Dollar Baby"" (2004) is that rare and daring film from Hollywood, when skilled direction, writing and acting come together in a surprisingly powerful manner. ""MDB"" is a small scale, low key, intimate film that packs honesty and raw, heart wrenching emotion.Hillary Swank gives a powerful performance as a poor, single waitress from a rural background, who decides, against the odds, to become a boxer. Clint Eastwood portrays a former boxer, now trainer in his own gym. He reluctantly accepts Swank as her first trainer. Morgan Freeman portrays a retired boxer who almost won a title under Eastwood's training. He is now an assistant to Eastwood at the gym and is the one who notices Swank's determination and gives her a chance getting started with training at the gym. Both Eastwood and Freeman give strong performances to back up Swank's memorable acting performance.Swank's character and transformation are convincing and believable, as she begins to find herself in life. Her toughness, stubbornness and determination help make her a winning boxer. From a troubled, broken family and a life of struggle, her new boxing career becomes a life renewed. During the several years of successful partnership as boxer and trainer, Eastwood gradually becomes a father figure to Swank.Nothing, however, really prepares one for the sudden and unexpected change of events that occur about midway into the story and dramatically changes the mood of the film. By this time, we have strongly bonded emotionally with Swank's character, feeling empathy for her life situation and struggles. So this sudden shift in the story is all the more powerful and sets the stage for deeply intimate and heart wrenching emotions in the second half of the film, which ends in a surprising and poignant manner.Unlike typical Hollywood films, ""MDB"" has honesty, sensitivity, believable, ordinary people and raw emotional power. ""MDB"" will leave you with lingering, heartfelt sorrow. An extraordinary film.",,Anonymous,Drama
Three of the best performances on film,"Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) is a boxing trainer whose daughter is painfully estranged from his life. He doesn't take risks with his fighters, he's calculated and protective; leaving him less than successful at his art.Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank) is a wannabe boxer, with an remarkable and unshakable focus on success; but her age is against her. Her family are less than supportive of her ambitions, and they are disrespectful to her in-spite of her desire to do the best by them.When Frankie begrudgingly agrees to teach Maggie, they learn to share a common feeling of fulfilment, and find the sense of family that they have both lost, in each other.Morgan Freeman plays an integral part in the story, his is Dunn's helping hand in the gym, while also being his council and his guide; but he is also the narrator of the story, in a very similar manner to the one used in the Shawkshank Redemption.Eastwood's direction is sublime, again he proves his knowledge of what a film needs to truly tell a story and compel an audience. All of the support characters are interesting, sometimes funny, but always well portrayed; the story itself is excellent, it has power and passion, and if it fails to provoke your emotions then i'm afraid you may in fact be dead.What completes this masterpiece is the performances of the leads players -Eastwood is typically brilliant, he's inspiring and impossible to take yours eyes off.Freeman is on top form, he's faultless and plays the voice of reason and rationality throughout the film.And finally Swank, she is simply awesome in this role, her physical ability as a boxer is astounding enough, but when coupled with her exemplary acting talent, she commands the screen in every scene with ease - AwesomeWhatever your expecting in this film, it won't fail to move you or impress you; it's a masterpiece 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

MDB is very unique with a plot that goes one way, veers a little about a third through, and then about two thirds goes off in a totally unexpected direction with fabulous results. It reminds me of Psycho in that way. Very brave and extremely unique. I can't think of any other film that does this.

Still I got hooked by the atmosphere,characters and (sometimes predictable)development of the story. Especially interesting for those fond of tearjerkers and fans of Clint, Morgan and Hilary.

I don't know what to really say and I am not questioning it, but perhaps due to my thick skin is the reason why I am not sobbing in tears but damn, you have to be heartless to not take this movie to your being.Many people have nit picked and were very critical in their reviews and comments but such is the world of criticism.

Eastwood does a great job with the characters and you feel like you know them/attached to them. I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. This movie is clearly worthy of all 7 Acadmy Award nominations and I believe that Eastwood should win best director, Swank should win best actress, Morgan Freeman should win best supporting actor, and this film should definitely win Best Picture.

How does Eastwood do it?,"Time and time again, the old school of Clint Eastwood has demonstrated that quality over quantity is the name of the game in the art of movie making. He manages to pluck winners with a pristine and clarity that would rival any producer/director of age today. He churns them out slowly, but when they arrive at our movie screen doorstep, the reward is well worth the wait.This movie rivals the effort and result that came from ""Unforgiven"". It will be regarded as a classic modern tragedy in the years to come. No one will forget seeing it. It deserved every Academy accolade it was given, if not short a few more.Morgan Freeman is the world best supporting actor of all time. Very few have the ability to debate this fact. No one fits this role better, or has mastered it better than he. Don't believe me? Rent ""Shawshank Redemption"", ""Seven"", ""The Power of One"". Hell, you could even rent ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" for all I care for the sake of argument. He shines even in a weak film.For Hiliary Swank, all I can say is that I misjudged her early. This woman was made for intense dramas. I had earlier thought that Hollywood propped her up as what was ""in"", but she has time and again since ""Boys Don't Cry"", proved me wrong. She is the real deal, and she has one hell of a career still ahead of her to dominate the industry and the acting peer space as one of the best of her generation.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Absolutely essential - Eastwood has done it!,"OK, I will admit from the outset that i like Clint Eastwood. I like his style, both his acting and directing style. I like the look of him, and whats more i think that he lends a certain gravitas to any movie he's involved with (whether he be on or off screen). However i will also say that although i found both 'Unforgiven' and 'Mystic River' to be satisfying movies on the whole, they each suffered problems which kept them from being all they could.I'm happy to say that with 'Million Dollar Baby' Eastwood has finally done it. His direction is as precise and exact as one could want, and with a unbelievable sense of balance he still manages to create a truly intimate and obviously personal picture. For me it is balance that is the key to why 'MDB' outdoes his previous efforts and elevates itself to the practically flawless. The emotion and atmosphere is never over the top (and if anything is slightly restrained) this maintains a hard-to-watch realism which demands your attention, draws you in and keeps you involved throughout.The real star of this picture is the beautiful Hilary Swank. As Maggie Fitzgerald she has done something many (including myself) thought impossible and surpassed her Oscar winning performance from 'Boy's Don't Cry'. With this mature, subtle and thoroughly expert turn she has proved that she is one of the most promising and talented actresses in the world today.Swank becomes the character. Swank is Maggie Fitzgerald. In this picture, Swank doesn't steal scenes, She owns them. She holds her own and more, even when sharing the screen with Freeman or Eastwood.This is a perfect example of classic direction, real emotion and fantastic acting from all involved. Swank deserves Best Actress without a doubt and likewise the Best Director should go to Eastwood.9 / 10",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
2004's best...Eastwood's usual...A lessonful masterpiece,"There weren't many contenders for 2004's #1 film spot. People say Sideways was a close first, come on, is that really the movie you want to be watching? I mean, it spelled snobbish all the way through. But Million Dollar Baby is a heartfelt, different side of things and that's what Eastwood likes. An example is his latest, Letters from Iwo Jima. It shows the Japanese point of view in WW2. I really do think that's key. If you run out of ideas for one subject, you take another side and milk it as much as possible. Million Dollar Baby is its own special category. This movie teaches us that ultimately, winners are simply willing to do what losers aren't and that's what screams out a lot in the movie. This film has a lot of heart and pride, and it sure wasn't taken away by the acting or directing of this film. Million Dollar Baby shows the rough side of things to really get the mood going and the mood was set off perfectly. There was remorse, guilt and willingness to do anything all through this film. This film cries out to be understood. Sometimes your family will let you down and sometimes you'll let yourself down but you just roll with the punches life has to offer.

Has both heart and legs,"For those who don't quite ""get"" women's boxing, let me recommend two books that might help. The first is Rene Denfeld's 1997 title Kill the Body, the Head Will Fall, a post-feminist critique. The second is a new book by Leah Hager Cohen (2005), Without Apology. Both books maintain an analytical and critical stance, while at the same time allowing readers the opportunity to ""get into the skin"" of those who are drawn to the sport. Our society's fear of (and consequent denial of) female aggression is symptomatic of a much deeper problem. Almost all psychologists and sociologists would agree that integrating our aggressive feelings and impulses is an important part in the development of human wholeness. The degree to which we deny this development to women is commensurate with the degree to which we deny them their full complement of humanity. The movie Million Dollar Baby provides a corrective, indeed wholesome model of a woman seeking just such wholeness and integration. The second issue (likely to draw more in the way of negative criticism) dealing with Frankie's mental torment when confronted with a life/death decision may seem a bit sanitized, but the pain of decision is well-portrayed, and the issue is one we have tried to duck as a society, as well. For those not afraid to consider alternative viewpoints, I would recommend the title Death and Dying in the very helpful Opposing Viewpoints series published by Greenhaven Press (2003).",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Most over-rated film of the century,"Having watched a few days after the movie grabbed the Best Picture Oscar, I cannot but record that it was a big let down. I haven't yet seen the other Oscar nominees of 2004, but then Beautiful Mind, American Beauty, Forrest Gump and English Patient too have won that Oscar (not to mention the all time greats such as Gone with the Wind, Midnight Cowboy and Kramer Vs Kramer) Is this movie on par with those? The movie does not truly explore the human relationships since we are not aware of many circumstances of the main actors. There appears to be a father-daughter relationship but we are not aware of the real father-daughter relationships of them. So how can we be sure? Are we supposed to read the book too? I am reminded of great story tellers such as David Lean who in Ryan's Daughter and Doctor Zhivago told complex stories while at the same time delving into the depths of human and social spirits.I have a feeling that ""Raging Bull"" is far ahead in exploring the human being beneath the boxer than this film. This is perhaps the most over-rated film so far in this century. Perhaps the super-human scale of Clint Eastwood is too overpowering. But all tear-jerkers are not good films.",5.0,Anonymous,Drama
Superb is an understatement.,"When I first saw the Flyers for this film wasn't keen to see it. Female Boxing is not my kind of sport, figured it was ""Rocky"" with tits, and wondered why Eastwood had bothered. Fortunately I did make the effort and how rewarding is this picture. It absolutely deserves the Oscars it won, and again establishes Clint Eastwood as a legend in his own time. The fight part of the story, although superbly realized, is secondary to the relationship between the case hard boxing trainer (Eastwood) and a fiery ambitious young boxer (Swank) who wants to succeed at all costs. Initially Eastwood wants no part of training a girl, but with the help of Morgan Freeman (as a old fighter who works in the Gym) Swank at last convinces Eastwood to train her. With results that neither party could imagine, it will effect their lives, and brings them together against tragedy. A human and moving drama set against the gritty background of boxing rings and training gyms. Up there with ""Requiem for a Heavyweight"" and ""Raging Bull"" (directed by Martin Scorsese who was pitted against Eastwood in the Academy Awards with ""The Aviator"") Eastwood made the film on a modest budget in less than 40 days shooting, which is a truly remarkable effort for a man in his 70's. Both directing and acting a lead role. One of the best ""boxing"" films ever produced, but more importantly one of the most human stories of love and ambition.

Hillary Swank won an Oscar for Best Actress, Morgan Freeman won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor and Clint Eastwood won two Oscars one for Best Director and Best Picture. This movie also has some humor in it. This movie was well directed by Clint Eastwood. I cannot wait to see Flags of Our Father and Letters from Iwo Jima. This movie was nominated for Best Actor - Clint Easwood, Best Film Editing and Best Adapted Screenplay. Clint Eastwood is one of the greatest directors. I almost own every movie he directed. Clint Eastwood makes some great westerns. Thank goodness Clint Eastwood has not died yet.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Incredibly moving - superb movie,"Frankie Dunn (played by Clint Eastwood) owns and runs a boxing gym in Los Angeles, as well as managing some of the boxers there. Working for him is Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman). One day he is approached by Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank) who wants him to train her. He declines. Undeterred, Maggie joins his gym, hoping that he'll notice her and train. He is equally perseverant, knocking back all her requests to train her. However, eventually she wears him down and he trains her and manages her fight career. Her career goes very well and she now has a shot at the WBA title. Her opponent, the champion, does not play fair though...Brilliant beyond description. Much much more than simply a boxing movie. It's a movie about friendship, looking out for one another and caring for those you love. Wonderful character depth and development and relationship development. Made by a twist nobody would see coming, and an ending that is emotional beyond compare.Superb performance by Hillary Swank in the lead role, for which she won her second Oscar. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman are also great in their roles - Eastwood got a Best Actor Oscar nomination and Freeman won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Freeman also provides the narration for the movie, and this is always a good thing.The movie itself deservedly won the Best Picture Oscar in 2005 and Eastwood won Best Director.This was to be Clint Eastwood's magnum opus and came in the middle of a purple patch for him. Before this he has made Mystic River and after was to come Flags of our Fathers, Letters from Iwo Jima, Changeling, Gran Torino and Invictus.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Very exciting and guarantee to make you cry,"I rarely see an Oscar nominated movie, but this motion picture is worth all the hype. The movie starts out like an old-school Rocky movie starting with exciting boxing scenes. I liked this movie for the unhappy ending and I found myself crying even four hours after the movie was over. Clint and Hilary have a great rapport that makes me like the two main characters. Hilary Swank is a great in her character as a boxer and she is very lady like also. I was surprised that Eastwood can still perform like his younger days. The locations were very well chosen and the cast was well chosen. It is very sad, but it is an excellent script and great direction by Clint. I loved it and I hope it wins some of those gold little statues.",,Anonymous,Drama
What a movie!!,"I did not see this for a movie till today. Great movie with two great performances. Hilary Swank, I must say suited perfectly for the movie. Looked tough like a professional boxer. Clint Eastwood is a gem of an actor with even greater ability in directing the movies. Hillary's character depicts how to be tough, resolute and stay focused on the ambition.Clint Eastwood's genius shows that a great movie does not require too much of budget of special effects.

"Good film, not deserving of it's praise.","So what is all this talk about Million Dollar Baby about? Well it is a good film, mostly directing. Clint I believe has himself another Oscar (Sorry Marty). The film does indeed look and feel real, which is a good relief from the recent Big Budget Fantasy films. Clint handles the characters extremely well and gives them each their moment in the sun.The gritty old feel of this film is perfect for it's style and the theme of boxing. Everyone gives great performances, unfortunately, Swank, doesn't deliver on the level of expectancy. Don't get me wrong, she does a very well job of giving the character emotion and depth and you feel for this girl, but it seems like we've seen it before and it becomes clichéd.The script was well written, the film actually becomes something of it's own in the third act, which is the best part of the film. Morgan Freeman and Clint both deliver great performances which saved the film from being another random ""Oscar"" movie, is this Clint's best? NO Is it this years best? No, Is it going to Win an Oscar? Yes, because it's the Oscars...",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Agree or disagree with it's controversial ending,you'll come away knowing you just watched a powerful drama.","Clint Eastwood just continues to top himself as a film maker.His latest masterpiece is Million Dollar Baby.This powerful,moving drama will have you cheering,as well as bring you to tears.All performances are memorable,particularly that of Hilary Swank.It is not often,in my opinion,that Oscars go to the right people.This is indeed a rare case of the award being given to the rightful person.Eastwood shines just as much in front of the camera as well as behind it,and he never goes wrong pairing himself with Morgan Freeman,whose Oscar was also well deserved(he was long overdue).The ending is a controversial one,as you will see,or probably have heard about in advance.Whether or not you agree with it,you will come away knowing that you have just watched an overwhelmingly powerful,dramatic film,proof that Clint Eastwood has indeed matured as a director.Like fine wine,he gets better with age.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Excellently executed, ""pulsating"" story","I have just seen the movie yesterday. I would completely agree with the previous comment by Andrew DiMonte - I will only add a few impressions of the way the movie has been made and the moving story presented.Everything, witch has to be said about the story, has been said by Andrew already, only the fact that the life of the characters is dramatically changed after a period of time. You would think, watching it, the film could be a straight, ""easy to digest"" story till the end, but it's not.As to the technique of the movie - from my point of view, witch gathered my attention from the beginning - is that the sources of expressions are simple, I would say somewhat ""rough"", yet they are so reach in their meaning. The interiors, tempo of the action, even acoustic effects, shallow echos of the sounds, pauses - remind me the characteristics of theater - the climate of the scene and the special relation between actor and the audience - that's what really matters in this film.You must see this movie.

Eastwood's 2nd Best,"Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, a long-in-the-tooth boxing manager and trainer who is too timid to allow his pupils to pursue the championship. As soon as Dunn loses his last protégé, along comes Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank, in her second Best Actress Oscar victory) into his gym, determined to be Dunn's next and first female boxer. After some nudging from his gym's janitor/companion and the film's narrator Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman, winning his first Oscar for a sub par performance), Dunn reluctantly takes young Maggie under his wing and finds the best fighter he's ever helped. From this point, I can't say too much more due to a major plot twist, but the film as a whole is a perfect example of the typical formula for a Shakespearean drama. Once again, my favorite scene is because of Eastwood's performance, about 15-20 minutes from the end, when the tough Dunn breaks down into tears in front of his priest, desperate for a perfect solution he ain't gonna get. Half a star is held back thanks to a pile of clichés like Maggie's pit bull of a final opponent, the bully of the gym getting his at the end, and Freeman narrating (sooo Shawshank). Besides that, holy McCuishle! If anything at all propels M$B into classics territory, it's the second act.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Move over Raging Bull, you have a sister","With the release of Million Dollar Baby, Clint Eastwood has officially entered the sweepstakes for golden statues in 2005. Already nominated for Five Golden Globes including Best Picture and Director, expect the same when the Academy announces its category finalists on January 25.Written by Paul Haggis (a Canadian that has spent most of his time writing for the small screen) and based on stories by longtime boxing manager and cutman Jerry Boyd (under the pen name, F.X Toole), the story surrounds boxing trainer Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) who reluctantly takes on a persistent female boxer named Maggie (Hilary Swank).The start of the film is textbook storytelling and you can see most of what is going to happen before it unfolds. Dunn is the reclusive manager that is reluctant to take on a female as a client believing that boxing is a sport for the Y-Chromosome's only - ""Girlie tough is not tough enough"" he mutters.But when a career waitress with aspirations of making a name for herself in the ring shows up in the gym with a work ethic that continues long after the lights are turned out, Dunn becomes intrigued by her determination and takes her under his tutelage.It is here that that Million Dollar Baby begins to separate itself from the formulaic. Although there is plenty of ringside action, the movie somehow is able to have the gruesome boxing matches as only a back drop for what becomes a budding relationship between the two leads. Match after match and day after day, Dunn and Maggie become closer, sharing each others hopes and dreams and inviting each to share in family experiences.But just when you think you have figured out where Million Dollar Baby is headed, it takes a sharp turn. One of those turns that we as critics like to see but hate when we have to review. The last third of the movie revolves around the consequences and situations of the device and it would be a disservice to anyone reading a review to have it revealed.So, we focus on the positives of the first two-thirds. The wonderful understated performance by Morgan Freeman (together again with Eastwood after 1991's, Unforgiven), as former boxer Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris, for example. Freeman is the driving force of the growing relationship between the two leads and pushes the story along with such subtlety and effortless motion as to put him also in line for a golden nomination.Even the tiny little subplots work well to create atmosphere and build character. The characters that participate in daily training at Dunn's gym, Maggie's trailer-living family and Dunn's estranged daughter are all crafted masterfully by director Eastwood into telling a moving story that will haunt you long after you leave the theatre.Client Eastwood struck gold with Mystic River last year and hits the same vein with Million Dollar Baby. It is his 25th attempt behind the camera and he just gets better with experience (I will forgive him for Bloodwork, but barely). I think this new career high for Eastwood is because he simply 'gets it'. He understands that life doesn't have happy endings all the time. That movies don't have to put an aging acting icon together romantically with a young budding actress in order to get audiences to take notice. And that movies can just end when they should, not all wrapped in a bow.It is surprising for this writer how boxing movies have had more critical success than any other sporting depiction despite the fact that the sport itself is in a time of mistrust, arguable decisions and no true heavyweight icon like Ali and Foreman were back in its heyday. But when you take the Rocky's, Raging Bull's and now Million Dollar Baby into account you can argue that not even the Field of Dreams, Pride of the Yankees and Eight Men Out's can stand as consistently proud of their output.That noted, Million Dollar Baby stands alone. Alone as a boxing movie. Alone as a character study, and alone as maybe the best film of 2004.www.gregsrants.com",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Fine Movie,"This film certainly deserves the Oscar nomination and to my mind is a better movie than The Aviator.The film focuses on a wannabe boxer who like most boxers is from a poor background. The only difference here is that the boxer in question is a woman. Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank) wants Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) to be her manager. He doesn't want to manage a woman, but I don't think it's giving too much away to say that he finally takes her on.One of the best things about this film is that the boxing is realistically shot and the fact that it's womens boxing doesn't feel out of place. Whilst Swank deservedly takes the honours for acting, Eastwood and Freeman are as dependable as ever. The final act is very well played and if you're into fell good movies I'd steer clear of this. 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

"""Baby"" carries a powerful punch and knock-out performances","""Million Dollar Baby"" is really two films in one. A classic underdog story about a white trash waitress who wants to be a boxer. She comes from a small poor trailer town and saves whatever money she earns to give to her thankless mother back home. Hilary Swank plays Maggie Fitzgerald and she is good natured and only wants to fulfill her dream. She knows that Frankie Dunn, an aging struggling gym owner and former trainer is the man to get her there.Clint Eastwood plays Frankie and he's fighting his own demons. He attends church every day for no apparent reason. He isn't sure why he goes everyday, but he just feels he needs to make up for his lost daughter and his empty career. When Maggie appears in his gym for guidance, he sends her on his way, but she keeps coming back because of her determination and he eventually gives in. The two of them form an unusual bond. They ultimately need each other. She needs him to help her dream come true and as a father figure. Frankie sees Maggie as the daughter who'll return his letters and be in his life.The boxing sequences aren't focal or anything special, but they're well directed and simple. Eastwood accomplishes what he needs to with these. The story is about the characters. It's not a boxing film. Naturally, Maggie gets better and better and a title match ensues.While the first portion of the film is a true underdog story, the rest of it is a tearjerker as something unexpected occurs. Both portions blend well together and you'll be weeping like a baby. The film is a story about commitment, dedication, family, and redemption.All the roles are carefully laid out and as Eastwood has gotten older and older, he has gotten better and better as a director. Like, last years ""Mystic River"", he directs his scenes with simplicity and he does it carefully without being too flashy. He lets his actors carry his films. Speaking of which, Hilary Swank is nothing short of amazing. She hits every right note as the naive woman who wants nothing more than to follow her dream and have a better life than she knows she has. Eastwood is terrific too. His best roles and acting jobs are when he is playing characters his own age. He hits the right notes more times than not. Morgan Freeman narrates the film and sort of plays the conscience of the film, like he did in Shawshank Redemption.I don't know if ""Million Dollar Baby"" will come home with Oscar gold. It's not as flashy as ""The Aviator"", but it's a better film and it will have you talking when you leave the film. (****)",,Anonymous,Drama

"A vintage of a film by Clint Eastwood -- for mature appreciation, no doubt","A rare true depiction of life's fragility - its dilemma of hopes and dreams, risk taking and facing mishaps - can we ever avoid, do we always blame - does God care? ""Birth, Aging, Sickness, Death"" are inevitable stages to one's life cycle (a Chinese traditional saying).I really like this Clint Eastwood film. Besides directing, producing, and performing in ""Million Dollar Baby,"" Eastwood also did the music which was simply well-integrated and perfectly composed to match and quietly enhance the plot progression, the mood, and the reaction of the characters. This is a gutsy film, gritty in emotions. It can be a tear-jerker yet not at all sentimental. It tells it like it is - the down to earth hard living of boxing (the theme being a 'crutch'), while the crux of the story concentrates on three main characters (each with haunting past): Eastwood as Frank the weathered boxing trainer, Hilary Swank as Maggie the enthusiastic spark in this whirl of boxing energy, and Morgan Freeman as ""Scrap"" - besides being the voice-over narrator, provided the bridging catalyst as the cool and caring mainstay to both Frank and Maggie. There are sprinkles of wit and humor here and there - that's how life is: making up of laughter and smiles occasionally in the midst of challenges and struggles, joys and disappointments, hesitation and reinforcement of faith, plucking up courage to take that risk, and mishaps nevertheless happen. There is ""whose life is it anyway"" dilemma - the confrontation of death, to be or not to be. Reminds me of the theme of Alejandro Amenábar's ""The Sea Inside"" (a film I've yet to catch - it was shown for only a few days just before Christmas week. A good film with tough subject is so hard to come by.)Since ""True Crime"" 1999 (which I appreciate and posted comments), I prefer this Eastwood endeavor more than ""Mystic River"" 2003, ""Blood Work"" 2002, ""Space Cowboys"" 2001. Here we have basically a simple story in structure (screenplay by Paul Haggis), focusing on only three main characters (not ensemble casts we've been getting so often lately). This is not exactly a total upbeat film, but it is poignantly true in the expression of feelings, conversations, and the inevitably linked relationships between them - unspoken support to each other in being alive, appreciating living and respecting death.Yes, the subject of death is not being shied away - it's approached head on with no circumventing the issue. With the ending of year 2004, the many events that involved increasing number of deaths, debate on wars, disasters, religious beliefs - the question of faith does come into play. There are no straightforward answers to questions of morality or the right thing to do - God's or man's decision (one believes that God works in mysterious ways for reasons one may not understand fully). And so the ending, be it a resigned assumption or not, it boils down to trusting one's heart with faith. And Freeman's calm voice closes well as it began - almost with a poetic touch to the tone.The music lingered on (Lennie Niehaus orchestrated) beyond the credits roll. ""Million Dollar Baby"" - a loaded title (precious Maggie that appeared from nowhere; replacing an empty spot of an unreachable daughter; the professional status Maggie attained; takes a lot of heart to train her; takes a lot of courage to fulfill her request). The film did present and tackled a thoughtful subject after all. This may not be a Hollywood blockbuster, but the three stars' impeccably inhabited roles in this quintessential Eastwood film certainly warrant equal appreciation.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
A true sports drama masterpiece!,"Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take a sports boxing real human life portrayed Drama, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Million Dollar Baby (2004) is Clint Eastwood's true masterpiece and one of his best movies and touching performances I have ever seen. This movie is million miles way better than the new movie Creed (2015)!! Creed (2015) hides from this movie! Clint Eastwood plays Dunn and directs, produces and composes music for this acclaimed, multiaward-winning tale of heart, hope and family. This is the real sports boxing drama portrayed about human young woman's life been a boxer. A lot of people disagree with me for not liking Gran Torino Clint Eastwood's overrated movie and does not accept that I love this movie. Beside Rocky and Southpaw is my third favorite best sports drama boxing movie. I just love this movie to death, I love it so much. This film is touching, powerful, incredible movie with amazing, amazing performances from Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank. Clint Eastwood sure did a great well excellent direction on this movie. This is my favorite best Clint Eastwood movie and no one can tell me not liking it, like Gran Torino that movie is better, in my opinion is not. Million Dollar Baby is the best human boxing drama life portrayed in a film ever!Million Dollar Baby is about an under-appreciated boxing trainer, the mistakes that haunt him from his past, and his quest for atonement by helping an underdog amateur boxer achieve her dream of becoming a professional. This movie isn't just about fighting and boxing matches it is about a bond, friendship and true love for sport. The chemistry between Clint and Hilary was awesome and masterful done, they both make a connection bond between father and daughter. Maggie Fitzgerald never had a father, while Frankie Dunn never had a daughter before. The underdog tale about young girl's life ids astonish telling, but the film isn't only about her. It is a about grief Frankie did a big mistake in the past and he does not want to repeat again. Morgan Freeman did awesome performance as retired boxer Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, Dunn's gym assistant.Great story with good action and well mix of emotion. One of the best movies but saddest movies I've ever seen I love boxing there's a few boring bits but overall great movie well done. Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman & Hilary Swank provide a storyline much deeper than simply the world of women's boxing. Another Directing delight from Clint Eastwood !! What more can I say? Just amazing. Humor, photography, acting - all exemplary. The music was rather repetitive though. It holds up well over the years. Loved the way the relationships were drawn. I think Million Dollar Baby is the Best Movie in the world I think this Movie is for the older crowd Awesome movie by the Way. Another score for Hilary Swank (best actress for the second time)! Excellent movie all the way around, superb acting from all the cast. If you haven't seen it and think it's just a ""boxing"" movie then you're really missing out. it's much more about the characters and their relationships, past and present. Very powerful movie. Highly recommended!Hilary Swank did the best job in the world playing Margaret ""Maggie"" Fitzgerald, a determined, aspiring boxer, I seriously love the actress. She was my first true crush love since I saw her in a TV movie Dying to Belong (1997) wen she was so damn sexy and hot and her previous movie The Next Karate Kid (1994). This is dramatic filmmaking at its finest. Eastwood paints a realistic, down-to-earth dramatic picture with this film. The trio of stars (including Eastwood himself) gives the performances of their careers - no one is overacting or winking at the camera.The most what I love is how we find more about Maggie's life. What I never saw in any movie beside Rocky what can happen to a boxer if he get's permanently damaged. The fights in this movie are realistic in the last fight when Maggie gets a deadly shot by her opponent in her blind side and lands on her head on the corner stool, breaking her neck and than suffers spinal neck injury that leaves her paralyzed for life. That was real, everything is real! I never saw that you can get paralyzed from fighting for life! The last 1/4 of the movie is about euthanasia and human morals. Maggie is bedridden for a long time and eventually has to have her leg amputated due to bed sores turning gangrenous. That scene really remind on my mother when she was lining in the hospital and the doctors amputated her leg. I love how Maggie stick up for her self once in her life when her mother and her sister tried to ripped her off and squeeze her out off her money. All her family was ever caring was just money not their daughter/sister's health and life.

Just A Few Words,"This is a great film to see once. Acting by cast is always in the moment. Feelings evoked are operatic in scale, and humanely humble. Narration is authoritative, precise, and penetrating. The stories, by F.X. Toole, on which the film is based, richly reveal the true grit of human nature. The boxing is as good as that in Cinderella Man. That is good.There three major characters in this film. Freeman, as Scrap, doubles as the narrator. Whenever he narrates, his voice brings authority, precision, and penetration to each and every word.Eastwood, as Frankie, doubles as director, and writes much of the haunting score.Swank, as Maggie, has to deal with a character not quite as finely-drawn as the heroine of Girl Fight, but she, like Eastwood, brings pathos to many scenes that require ""doing nothing, very well."" She reaches peaks of performance she aimed for in Boys Don't Cry. She brings authenticity to the role of Maggie, the poor girl struggling hard to overcome poverty.They all earned Oscars for their work.Some of the dialog in Million Dollar Baby is terse, telling, and subtly beautiful. For example, Scrap tells Frankie that people die every day thinking they never got their shot. It is a short speech, but worthy of the line of poetry about people leading lives of quiet desperation. It should remain in the living language for quite some time.The film may suffer, however, from the rash decision by director Clint Eastwood, to shoot from what was essentially screen writer Paul Haggis' rough draft. On repeat viewing, some of the longer scenes that evoke true empathy the first time seem to drag. The whole work then becomes clunky and manipulative.On the DVD, the bonus features are great!",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Best Picture: A Masterpiece,"""Million Dollar Baby"", winner of 4 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress, and Best Supporting Actor is in a word...extraordinary. It is a motion picture as beautiful and rare as a precious gem.Clint Eastwood crafted a masterpiece with deep characters and a brilliant, moving story. The film centers a around a grizzled old fight trainer and gym owner, Frankie Dunn (Eastwood), his sidekick, Eddie ""Scrap Iron"" Dupris (Morgan Freeman), and an aspiring female boxer, Maggie (Hilary Swank). The characters teach us that even though life can be hard dreams are worth pursuing because if we're lucky we all get one chance at achieving our dreams. We learn that no matter what happens to us, we're better off if we can say we had our shot.Hilary Swank gave a stunning performance as Maggie and dazzles on the screen. Her work in this film is a lesson in acting and earned her, at the young age of 30, a second Academy Award win for Best Actress. She improves upon her Academy Award winning performance in ""Boys Don't Cry"" (1999).Morgan Freeman earned his first Academy Award, as Best Supporting Actor for his turn as a hardened, hard luck, wise old former boxer who manages Frankie's gym and looks after some of the boxing hopefuls who train there.Early in the fall of 2004 when critics began to zero in on which films and performances were Oscar contenders, ""Million Dollar Baby"" was barely on their radar screen. That's because the film had been planned for a 2005 release and was not available early in the fall. Eastwood only began shooting the film in June of 2004, which would ordinarily be too late in the year for a film to be available for release that same year. But Eastwood filmed the movie in only 37 days. The beautiful screenplay by Paul Haggis needed no rewriting, and most scenes were filmed in one take. When studio execs at Warner Bros., which released the film, saw an early rough copy in the early fall, they were so impressed that they rushed the film so that it could be released in time to qualify for the 2004 Academy Awards.Once it appeared, the critical acclaim for ""Million Dollar Baby"" was enormous. A.O. Scott of the New York Times marveled at the subtle beauty of the film and lauded its director, Clint Eastwood. He called it a masterpiece and proclaimed it the best film released by a Hollywood studio in 2004. Scott compared it to the classic films of Hollywood's heyday when pictures were in black and white. The popular critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times stated in his review, ""Million Dollar Baby is a masterpiece, pure and simple, deep and true."" The film was instantly thrust into the running for the Best Picture Oscar and the buzz surrounding it began to grow.After a brilliantly timed, modest Oscar campaign which included a limited December release and a nationwide release the weekend after the Academy Award nominations were announced, the film gained momentum so that by the time the Academy Awards show aired only a month later, ""Million Dollar Baby"" had become the new front runner for Best Picture. Early on, the front runner had been ""The Aviator"" (2004), the Howard Hughes biopic, directed by Martin Scorcese, which had captured the Golden Globe for best Drama Picture. ""The Aviator"" also garnered 11 Academy Award nominations compared to 7 for ""Million Dollar Baby.""Among the film's 7 Academy Award nominations was a surprising acting nomination for Clint Eastwood. He received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for what many critics hailed as the best acting performance of his fifty year career.""Million Dollar Baby"" also brought Eastwood a second Academy Award win for Best Director, for a film many critics believed to be his best work. He had won the Academy Award for Best Director previously for ""The Unforgiven"" (1992), which also took home an Oscar for Best Picture.""Million Dollar Baby"" is the best film to win the Oscar for Best Picture in the '00s.",,Anonymous,Drama
boxers' blues- one of the more notable points in Eastwood's career,"Something a friend of mine talked with me about after he and I had seen the film was a good point about the film's dramatic structure (which prompted me to see the film a second time, aside from knowing intrinsically it would get doused in Oscar liquid). It's like a darker, slightly harsher Aesop tale, with simplicity in its message ingrained into it, but with power none-the-less. I wouldn't say even after a second viewing that Million Dollar Baby, Clint Eastwood's latest film as one of the few remaining Hollywood auteurs, is one of his very best films (I don't know if I may be one of only a few that found Mystic River more shattering on the whole). Still, I think that at the least with these two latest films, Eastwood has reached on his own level the heights of one of his great dramatic influences- director Vittorio De Sica. His films were filled with an intuitive touch of humanity, observing where heart lies within people, and where it doesn't. Aside from the darker themes that the film brings up, it's also at the core a simple tale of those who observe who has heart, kindness, and who doesn't.Eastwood is better than usual as Frankie, a trainer and owner of a boxing gym. His friend and observer of the film's details, Scrap (Morgan Freeman, supreme in his understated performance), was once a boxer too, but with going too far with a fight, he became half-blind, but given a job and residence by a guilt-ridden Frankie (who is so for that and a few other things, some kept perfectly ambiguous). When he loses his boxer for being 'over-protective', a woman, Maggie (Hilary Swank, intuitive as always in her scenes), asks to be trained. After much convincing, Frankie takes her on, and little by little, he gets looser on his strict terms of not being questioned with his teachings. Then, as Maggie finally reaches the top, there comes what is called in screen writing as the second turning point, and the story turns its last act into the contemplative, the deep, and the tragic.One thing that grabbed me even more so on a second viewing was that the theme of what boxing does to the human spirit and psyche is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, as Scrap observes, it's ""un-natural"", to be moving around getting right in the face of pain and not running away, and how it is not a very glamorous 'sport' at all (a theme that makes it more worthy than a lessor boxing movie would give). On the other hand, it also goes in hand with the theme of having heart; the two supporting characters of Danger (in a satisfactory performance by Baruchel) and Shawrelle (Mackie), who are a major contrast. I really liked how Eastwood and writer Paul Haggis (from a book of short stories) dealt with the sub-plot to go so well with the main plot of Frankie, Scrap and Maggie. Another exceptional scene that makes this point clearer- and more resonant as the final act unfolds- is when Maggie gets a treat on her 33rd birthday from Scrap, and he tells his story about how he lost sight in his eye. In this scene, both of the actors are brilliant in their tone and reactions, it makes for one of the more meaningful, and dramatically compelling, pieces of the story.I wouldn't say, as I said, that the film is entirely flawless (which is arguable, I know). One problem I had both times I saw it, though not overall, was with Morgan Freeman's narration. For the most part it is insightful and narratively correct, but unlike Freeman's key narration role (as the key observer in Shawshank Redemption), not every line seemed very crucial for the story. It is a simple story with simpler, sometimes philosophical notes of narration, but I sometimes wished that everything had to be outlined - one can sense things right in Eastwood's face and eyes while Freeman talks gruffly behind him. And, arguable still, the sheer simplicity of the film does leave it so that one can't figure out parts of the story for themselves.Never-the-less, the film is an extraordinary stroke of skill for Eastwood as a director. If one can't say that his performance is one of his very best, one could say that his direction, his use of the camera (via DP Tom Stern), is at a peak. The way he uses his strokes of lighting and darkness, and with the way he can control the camera and not be (un-appropriately) flashy, makes it extremely professional. That he's been known to shoot scenes in one or two takes makes for such a sweetly spontaneous result, however totally controlled. Indeed, I agree whole-heartedly with one critic who said ""to call this an old man's film is a sincere compliment"", especially on the craftsman side. A-",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Absolutely brilliant... one of the best Eastwood films.,"MILLION DOLLAR BABYWow... this is a great film. I am not surprised that it won 4 Oscars, 2 Golden Globes, 2 Screen Actors Guild Awards and 10 other awards from various institutes.The story is about a guy who lives and works in a gym. All through the film you are hearing what he is seeing. He is seeing a tough trainer refusing to train a girl, all because she is a girl. The journey the three of them take together is a real roller coaster. I really can't explain more than that without posting spoilers.The story is so touching and emotional. I have been sitting here staring at this screen for about 10 minutes not knowing what to type. This film really has left me speechless.At first I thought it was going to be Rocky with a female. But it was nothing like it. Yes there was boxing and training, but in a completely different way.Now, it seems a boxing film can't be made realistically. Every boxing film I have seen just can't quite make the boxing look real... unfortunately it is the same with this one. I watch a lot of boxing and it is all about skill and technique. But in these movies it seems it is all about getting your butt kicked until you all of a sudden win with one punch. There were bits in this film where one boxer in particular did some underhanded moves... if that happened in real boxing the boxer in question would have been disqualified straight away... but not in this film. It is a shame, but I also understand that the film makers are trying to make the film more interesting. I do still love boxing movies... the Rocky movies are classic (except for part V... terrible!), and they are not very realistic either.The acting was absolutely brilliant. The casting was perfect. Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank & Morgan Freeman star in this. And if Clint wasn't busy enough, Directed by Clint Eastwood, Produced by Clint Eastwood & Original Music by Clint Eastwood. The man is a legend.There is so much I want to talk about here... but I can't really because it will give to much away.I will give this film 8 out of 10.A very strong story and a very strong performance.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Perfect,"Clint Eastwood is simply a master, and of all his directorial achievements, this for me is the sweetest of the bunch. A film adapted from a short story and fleshed out to be something so much more incredible, and which blindsided everybody as a great deal more than ""just another sports movie"". The story is told with so much cinematic swagger it should be illegal; it is perfectly paced, with not a frame wasted.Clint and Morgan Freeman work as well as two masters should, to the extent that you could watch every scene with just them and simply enjoy the banter of the characters they create. Hilary Swank impresses, and together with ""Boys Don't Cry"", this performance shows that when given the chance, she can go toe-to-toe with the best and stand her ground.The whole thing is beautifully played out; it is intelligent, surprisingly emotional, and finds its way into your heart. Literally a perfect film.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"I enjoyed Clint Eastwood's fable, but had some reservations","Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a film not so much about boxing but one about a boxer. Hilary Swank plays Maggie, an inept fighter with a lot of heart and ambition, but her gender leaves her at a training disadvantage. This fact is most true with Frankie, played with a crusty soulful mourn by director Clint Eastwood. He will not train a girl, never has and never will. The movie never makes it completely clear why Maggie has chosen Frankie, but that seems beside the point.There is a lot of boxing in ""Million Dollar Baby."" More so than in ""Girlfight,"" ""Raging Bull,"" or possibly even the ""Rocky"" films. I have never been a boxing fan and did not start while viewing this film. Though the sport disinterests me, the rise of Maggie's abilities struck as impressive. She comes from a small town but travels to Frankie's gym to strike it big.Frankie, an ex-fighter much closer to the end of his training career than the beginning, cannot bring himself to take a stab at a high-profile duel even with his most talented fighter. When he leaves Frankie for greener pastures, Frankie decides then to take on the girl who cannot hit the punching bag correctly and doesn't have enough money to spend on a speed bag.The film's narration is threaded by the great, vital voice of Morgan Freeman, who helps out and lives in Frankie's gym. It is he, an ex-boxer as well, who first sees Maggie's raw talent and heart. That is the stem to this flower, how it blooms is up to the viewer to experience on their own unmolested by the words on this page.. The almost unanimous love ""Million Dollar Baby"" has appreciated from critics leaves me wondering a few things. Paul Haggis' script follows many of the same routes accessed by films of the past. Frankie and Maggie's relationship follows a well documented formula; Freeman's narration is well sounding but its service as a crutch to move the story along is apparent early on; the film's final third, which houses its most brilliant scenes, ignores the stories it nourished before. Freeman all but disappears and an odd sub-plot involving a scrawny boxer in Frankie's gym is underdeveloped and is never as satisfying as the filmmakers wish.The acting is superb, especially noting Hilary Swank who has reprised her role as an actress who shines after appearing from nowhere. She gained this accolade after winning an Oscar for her heart-breaking role in ""Boys Don't Cry."" Clint Eastwood has improved with age and abandons much of his stoic image that has aided him in the past. Morgan Freeman is fine, but his role isn't as fleshed out as I would like and we have seen him much better in the past, including his previous pairing with Eastwood in ""Unforgiven.""I seem apologetic to inform the reader that I liked Eastwood's film but did not love it. After all of the awards and critical acclaim, I cannot honestly jump up and down for ""M$B,"" as some have lovingly nicknamed it. My happiest moment was falling back in love with Hilary Swank, taking on another role not for the standard pretty Hollywood actress. Let us pray she never becomes one. *** out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
The Characters are Great!,"Do not let anyone tell you that this is not a film about boxing as some critics have said - it is, or at least 85% of it is. But, whether you are boxing fan or not (and I am definitely not!) this is a great film, that is brilliantly acted and directed with the three main characters being stand-outs. Firstly, Clint Eastwood's acting and direction are peerless, while Morgan Freeman brilliantly plays his part in an understated way, but what a performance by Hilary Swank - the Academy had to give her the Oscar. The mood of the boxing game was well-caught, but without giving anything away the last half-hour of this movie is fantastic, and will remain in the memory of all who see ""Million Dollar Baby"". Clearly Eastwood is the premier Director in Hollywood with his great ""Mystic River"" and now this.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Nicely done drama about a VERY interesting  subject.,"Million Dollar Baby is half boxing movie, and half... Something else (I don't want to give away spoilers). If you go in expecting inspiring Rocky-type heroics, you're going to be VERY disappointed. If on the other hand, you want a moving, sombre experience who two of America's great modern day actors (Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman, in case you haven't guessed) and Hilary Duff matching her amazing turn in Boys Don't Cry as a female boxer, then step this way.The relationship between Duff and Eastwood forms the centrepiece of the film... She comes from a rubbish family, and is reduced to stealing leftovers from the cafe where she works just to eat. All the money she does make goes towards her dream... Which is to be a professional fighter. Eastwood is a gruff, dismissive owner of a local gym... Who doesn't believe girls should fight and that at 31, she's too old anyway. But she insists on bothering him, until he reluctantly agrees to train her... And as they begin to spend time together, she becomes sort of a surrogate daughter to him. Seeing as how he made such a pig's ear of his ties towards his flesh and blood one...Some of the dialogue exchanges feel a little too calculated in the context of the film and a few situations seem a bit overly 'set up' for maximum dramatic impact, as opposed to feeling authentic. Nevertheless, this is an extremely involving two hours, whether it be the brilliantly directed ringside sequences, or the well maintained interaction between the three main stars. And when the shift focuses to... Something else in the devastating third passage of the script, get those hankies out. The acting muscles REALLY emerge, and we see why this cast is so renowned.Seriously, get the Kleenex along with the popcorn. You'll need it. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Eastwood, Swank and Freeman are tuned to the same devastating emotional string--that Eastwood delivers such a performance while also directing the picture is nothing short of an artistic miracle.The film is aptly named, its title reminds us of an old song which plays in our hearts and minds long after the movie is done.",,Anonymous,Drama

"Great acting, powerful story but  ""What did he say?""","Acting: Overall, the acting is superb. Morgan Freeman and Hillary Swanks were brilliant, and Clint was good but not great. How difficult is it to play a crusty old man that grouches at everyone? Clint's acting could have been a bit more nuanced at those times in the story when he is supposed to feel sad or uncertain or frustrated. Most supporting characters were also tremendous - totally convincing and they did a lot with their characters. A priest and a family lawyer were the two characters that did not work for me.Cinematography was good with an effective gritty realism to the first 70% of the movie. There were some some noticeable lapses in story-telling and continuity.Worst problem with the film was the sound. Much of the narration and dialog early in the movie were hard to make out, Morgan Freeman is occasionally unintelligible. And in a climatic scene, Clint Eastwood chooses to deliver the most memorable line in the movie in a whisper that left my wife and I asking ""what did he say?

A Punch in the Stomach,"This is a very touching human drama movie, with the best director, best actors, and the best story.""Million Dollar Baby"" directed by Clint Eastwood was released in 2004, and received four Oscars that year. This is a breathtaking human drama about a thirty-one year old Maggie (Hilary Swank) and a boxing trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood.)Maggie a waiter from the poor and dysfunctional family decides to make a change in her life. She asks the experienced boxing trainer Frankie to be her coach and manager. Frankie refuses Maggie at first, but with the help form Frankie's old partner Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman), Maggie walks in to his gym and starts training.Maggie is a very determined hard worker and wins 12 matched on a row by KO. Then she starts receiving offers for bigger matches, and Frankie makes a decision to make her go for the championship match against ""Blue Bear"" Billy in Las Vegas. She enters the ring with confidence, but she and Frankie did not know the life waiting for them after this game.Hilary Swank went for a three months training to prepare for this role, and plays very powerful and emotional role. It is certainly a magnificent performance, and she won her second Oscar for this role, after winning her first one for ""Boys Don't Cry."" Morgan Freeman also plays a wonderful role as Frankie's partner, very quite but has a strong presence. He won his first Oscar for his role, after being nominated four times in the past.I will give this movie ten out of ten, and recommend it to anyone over 13 years of age. Especially to those who are in a relationship or having trouble with family members. This is not just a simple boxing film, but it makes you think about life and death. This movie has a twist in the end, so do not go to the bathroom in the last 20 minutes. Be prepared, it is going to leave you speechless.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Sports fan or not, check this film out","This is one of the best boxing movies every made, heck it's one of the best sports movie I ever seen.

And as time goes by her game and skill improves. It's inspiring and yet depressing film that is most definitely a classic. Didn't even know of Hilary Swank but she puts on a amazing performance and she is going to go far in the movie industry, this movie is so good it basically made her.

This film is a must see!,"Million Dollar baby follows the journey of Maggie (Hilary Swank) as she works toward her goal of becoming a professional boxer. Her first fight is to convince Frankie (Clint Eastwood) to become her trainer and show her the way to the top. This film is set and directed in such a way where there is not a lot of emphasis on a particular characters story or life but simply highlights the ups and downs of each character. The main focus is on Maggie and her journey however the film also incorporates the stories of Frankie and Eddie (Morgan Freeman) who is Frankie's assistant. This film offers so much to the viewer. It does a great job in creating a deep connection between the viewer and the characters. It is set in such a way that the viewer feels like they a part of the film. It is easy to feel for each character especially when Maggie is dealing with her unappreciative mother and other family members. Maggie is a very tough and loyal woman and inhibits the type of determination that does not show any signs that she is afraid to fail. This movie is simple yet complex and offers a very interesting plot and theme. It is refreshing to see a hard hearted character like Frankie begin to soften from scene to scene and be able to appreciate his loyalty and protectiveness towards Eddie and Maggie. He is tough on the exterior and that is what makes his character so believable. Clint Eastwood is a talented actor and was able to make the character Frankie come alive. Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank also delivered outstanding performances in this film. It was also nice to see Maggie as her character grew from scene to scene. You cannot help but appreciate her character and how even though her boxing career begins to take off she still remains the same and never forgot where she came from. When I watched this film I assumed that it would be a movie based and centered around boxing but it was so much more than that. Whether it is boxing, obtaining a new career, or any type of goal that we have this movie showcased how much work and determination it really takes to reach a goal. Maggie's character is a role model for what women of all ages can achieve. She entered into what Frankie saw as a man's sport and took it by storm. This film is a must see.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Good flick, but a bit overrated","This was a pretty good movie. Clint Eastwood directs in a reasonable, straightforward way that does not detract from the story or the acting. Some directors just have to find a way to say ""LOOK AT ME!!!"" Oliver Stone comes to mind. Excellent athletic acting by Hilary Swank. And Eastwood's acting is by now as professional as it gets. Same for Morgan Freeman. I'm sure everyone is aware of the ending by now, but I will follow the rules and avoid writing a spoiler. I wish that I had not known what was coming. I can imagine how powerful all that must have been to people who thought that they were just watching a boxing movie. While I may not agree with the politics involved, it was done powerfully, and relatively tastefully. While I enjoyed the film, I don't believe that it is the 61st best movie of all time.

Flawed and therefore overrated,"Eastwood's film about a veteran boxing trainer who reluctantly takes on a female fighter starts slowly, builds in excitement, then abruptly runs out of ideas. I won't give away the ending (I've heard that if you do Eastwood comes round and personally beats the crap out of you), but I will say I found it clumsy, contrived and (worst crime) far too drawn out.The film works fine in the claustrophobic atmosphere of Eastwood's gym, but when Eastwood and Swank move out into the wider world it gets lost. Eastwood is preparing Swank for a world title fight, but where are the promoters, the agents, the TV crews(the fights appear to televise themselves, the lawyers, for goodness sake? Why doesn't anyone offer Swank sponsorship (for example Everlast, who get their logo into every other frame in this movie)? There's a bit where Swank mentions ""magazine articles"" but we never even see her talking to a fan, let alone a journalist. Her entire career seems to take place in a vacuum, when common sense tells you anyone who looked and performed like her would be an instant media sensation.The problem seems to be lie with the time-frame of the film. It's nominally set in the near-present (Eastwood waves a VHS cassette at one point) but its heart is in the '40s or '50s, or rather a sort of non-specific past mythical past you get in ""The Shawshank Redemption"".There's much to enjoy here in the way of dialogue and cinematography, balanced by some major longeurs and lapses of taste (such as going totally OTT in its determination to stick it to welfare claimants). It's not so very bad, but I can't see where the Oscar nominations are coming from.",,Anonymous,Drama
Thank God for Clint Eastwood.,"Thank God for Clint Eastwood. Every time I am tempted to despair of the American cinema industry, along comes Clint with one of his masterpieces. In this film, he starred, directed and produced. He even composed the music ! Clint Eastwood has a gift for avoiding the typical Hollywood clichés and superficialities without sounding pompous and yet manages to reach the true depth of any given situation. His films avoids any distraction which would not help the story along. This film is long - over 130 minutes - but it seemed short to me. The very tragic ending of this film could easily have been mishandled, but Clint keeps it simple, concentrating on the essentials. For the first time in years, I admit that I cried. Eastwood also made me doubt for the first time about my moral positions on euthanasia. I am still against it, but readily admit that reality has a way of creating situations which are more complex than what a philosopher would imagine. The main actors, Clint Eastwood along with Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman, are all simply superb. Now we expect that from veterans like Eastwood and Freeman, but Hilary Swank was an agreeable surprise, at least for me.

My favourite movie of all time,"I've rewatched Million Dollar Baby almost every year since it's release (about 10 times). I won't know why, but i just keep coming back. This movie sends out a big message to me which is 'pursue what you love in life to the best you can'.The movie makes my cry from the sheer power in Maggie's character. Sure she's strong physically, but her willpower and passion is where she is a knockout. Hillary Swank outshines any performance i've ever seen in acting in this movie and every scene involving her is powerful. I remember (after seeing this movie) watching most movies she's acted in and seeing her supreme acting skills shine through in all roles. Clint Eastwood is also top notch as Frankie, and the bond that develops between fighter and trainer is so well done and tasteful.Sure there are some extreme moments a little overdone at times like the absurd sheer ignorance of her family or the rediculous fighter she ends up competing with for the title. However, these extreme moments only make it more emotional and make you feel more strongly with the two main characters who are just trying to do a little good in the world.I come out of the movie with Maggie and Frankie feeling as role models and people to look up to in rough times.

A Classic,"The title is deceptive. It could be a Betty Grable picture - it once was a Priscilla Lane/Ronnie Regan movie - or a piece of show-biz hype about triumph over adversity. In fact, for it's first half that is exactly what it is and if the plot seems formulaic, Eastwood imbues it with such a feeling for character and milieu that cliché is the last thing you are likely to think of. Then about mid-way it takes a darker turn. Guilt and redemption come to the fore and the up-beat triumphalism of what has gone before is jettisoned in favor of another of Eastwood's bleak studies of the American malaise. Not a bad thing given his skill in handling this kind of material, though you may come away from the film admiring it rather more than you actually like it.As a director Eastwood has never been one to blind you with technique; this is an old-fashioned movie in the very best sense. The performances and the script drive it and even when it's at it's most austere the closest Eastwood comes to being 'cinematic' is a series of slow dissolves to blackness. And those performances are very fine indeed. If Hilary Swank fits her part of the trailer-trash hick who wants to be a boxer like the proverbial glove she, nevertheless, seems to find shadings and depth in her character that lifts her out of the ordinary.Morgan Freeman, virtually monosyllabic as an aging ex-boxer, conveys more with a look than most actors could do with a barrage of words. He is so much in character here that even his clothes seem to fit him like a second skin. But ultimately the film belongs to Eastwood in every sense. As a director he has developed a classic style that is the very antithesis of what modern movies are about; as an actor he has learned how to inhabit the character he plays with effortless skill. His performance here may well be the best thing he has done on screen, certainly on par with his William Munny in ""Unforgiven"" and this dark, sad, forgiving film bears mention in the same breath as both ""Unforgiven"" and last year's ""Mystic River"".",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

The story itself is about a desperate, white trash, waitress, (Swank) who dedicates her life to a sport that doesn't necessarily want her. Eastwood is a jaded boxing coach with a deep past. And Freeman plays a long retired boxer who was never able to make good with his big chance. It's a dark film, and the cinematography is appropriate to that.

Before see the movie I thought it would be a Rocky style movie where hero wins at the end in any situation. But here movie is totally different. At last crucial fight of Maggie she got hurt and made her to lying down in the bed. How pity! But my surprise, the real drama is just starting then and ends only in tearful eyes. I never expect such ending. It was a shock. That's why movie being different from others. It has two separate section first half is only boxing in pit and ring and rest second is in hospital.
Clint Eastwood has a brilliant and super acting as well as Hilary Swank too. Other is Morgan Freeman. Direction by CE is also superb. There is no wonder for winning 4 Oscars for such all time best movie. I strongly recommended for every movie lovers. Must watch (before you die.....as a list on IMDB).",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Brilliant!,"WOW!best picture of 2004 at the academy awards what can i say.Clint Eastwood directs this brilliant movie,I never thought much of him as an actor but as a director hes becoming a fascinating venture. 1.THE STORY flawlessly written. is about a young trailer trash park women with a Will to succeed in the boxing ring.she finds a helper/trainer with his own demons to deal with and together they find comfort.If you are expecting a girl rocky give up now cause you will be disappointed.this movie is not for people who think die hard was the best movie ever it is a thoughtful character study. 2.THE Performances Hilary swank is good as Maggie she is so natural you don't feel shes even acting.Morgan as always does not disappoint that Oscar was long overdue and clintwood is also good as Frankie Dunn the wrinkled old boxer.But truth be told Hilary did not need another Oscar especially for this role though shes good the role is not much demanding as the other nominees in that year she won for this role but she made audiences cry and feel for her character and swayed many votes her way""Imelda Stanton"" was robbed for Vera drake.Morgan on the other had has had better performances in his career but regardless of other nominees that Oscar was long overdue",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Excellent,"Very nice movie. Excellent performance by Clint Eastwood and Hilary Swank. Very much inspirational movie. Movie name is very much appropriate for the movie. Movie is one of the must watch movie, because it has inspiration for the peoples. Cast is mostly concentrated on the how one should react in life. It is true that life is 10% of the action(accidents) and 90% of reaction for that. The tragedy happened in movie is little unacceptable. Director could have choose something different. But picture is very good and direction is also good. Morgan Freeman played a good role too, how react to different things is nice. End is also good and appropriate. Thanks Dhruv for suggesting to watch this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Thousand Dollar Baby,"Eastwood and Freeman are good as the grumpy and wise, respectively, old men running a boxing gym but the film belongs to Swank, who is terrific as a determined female boxer. The boxing scenes are well staged. However, some of the characters are cartoonish and the plot is implausible. Maggie's family is portrayed as poor white trash without a single redeeming quality. It is hard to believe that Maggie, who is an angel, could have come from such a family. The plot device of Eastwood unable to connect with his daughter while building a relationship with Swank is too obvious. It explores some serious themes but treats them superficially. All in all, it is well-acted by the three stars but it certainly is not worthy of Best Picture or Best Director Oscar.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Very close to the bone - classic Hollywood cinema,"First of all: ""Million Dollar Baby"" is not a movie about boxing (neither are ""Raging Bull"" or ""Hurricane"", for that matter). Every film needs a setting, and the setting of ""Million Dollar Baby"" (adapted from several short stories by F. X. Toole) just happens to be the boxing world. Of course, there are a couple of rather violent fight scenes, but, as in all of the truly great 'boxing-movies', these are only a necessary means for telling a story that is about something completely different and much more universal.In the first scene, which happens to be one of the aforementioned fighting scenes, there is an impressive close-up shot of an open wound  a cut in a boxer's face, close to his eye  that defines the theme for the rest of the film. This is, indeed, a story about open wounds. Frankie (Clint Eastwood), a veteran boxing trainer, was once known as the best cut-man around  an expert in treating such wounds in boxer's faces. Ironically, he lacks expertise when it comes to taking care of his own (psychological) wounds. Some cuts, it is said at one time in the film, are just too deep or too close to the bone.Frankie lives alone. For some reason his daughter, apparently the only remaining member of his family, has deserted him and returns all of his letters unopened. All he has left is his business, an L.A.-based boxing gym crowded with some real fighters and a whole load of wannabes. His life suddenly changes when his long-time companion and ex-protégé Scrap (Morgan Freeman), who is also the narrator, discovers Maggie (Hillary Swank) among the many seedy characters in the gym. Maggie, a 31-year-old, uneducated, lower working class woman  ""trailer trash from the Ozarks"", as she puts it herself  wishes to be trained by Frankie and become a professional fighter so she can break the cycle of her unsatisfactory life and support her family. At first Frankie is skeptical; he's opposed to the idea of training a woman, and he obviously doesn't want to be involved in any way with a woman about the age of his daughter. But after a while, persuaded by Maggie and Scrap as well, he agrees and, of course, Maggie becomes one of the most successful fighters worldwide.In boxing, it is said, the final round is the hardest (that is, of course, unless one of the two fighters gets knocked out before that). The same thing is true for Eastwood's movie, which takes another abrupt turn towards the end, when after a drastic incident Maggie and Frankie's world is turned upside down once more and everything that seemed certain is in question again. It is up to Frankie now to make one more fateful decision.On the surface ""Million Dollar Baby"" has all the clichés and stereotypes: the loser who, through a metamorphosis achieved by hard practice, turns into the ultimate success (Maggie); the veteran mentor who has been through almost everything and has a hell of a time coping with all his grief (Frankie); the streetwise, somewhat poetic observer/adviser/narrator  blind in one eye  who serves as a moral authority (""Scrap""); the outright ridiculous and disgusting hillbilly clan (Maggie's family); and even a rather bizarre version of the terrifying, evil foreigner (Billie, the black, ex-prostitute, fighter from East-Berlin, played by real-life boxer Lucia Rijker). It is its frank and modest tone above all(just pay some attention to the sparse use the editors made of music and sound effects) that saves the film from being just another shallow and cheesy affair, and allows viewers take an interest in the characters' development and the outcome of the story, which can be said to raise more questions than it is able to answer.Essentially, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is an American story, the first half driven by a lively from-rags-to-riches or you-can-get-it-if-you-really-want mentality (furthered by constantly drawing on certain myths of the boxing world), the second half dominated by an atmosphere of absolute doubt. Clint Eastwood, along with screenwriter Paul Haggis, has created an outstanding piece of classic Hollywood cinema, dialogue-driven and simple in style. Highly recommended, not only for fans of boxing or movies about boxing!",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Would a Bright, Primary Color Here or There Be Too Much to Ask, Mr. Eastwood?","""Million Dollar Baby"" hit me like a punch to the solar plexus while I was watching it in the theater. But then afterwards, when I started to think critically about the movie, little nagging details started to really bug me and took away from the film's lingering impact.Clint Eastwood does fine work as an actor, but my praise of his directing abilities has cooled somewhat over time. There's something overly formal about his films that always remind me I'm watching a movie. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is relentlessly gray and brown, both in actual physical production design and in tone. Though it seems like matter-of-fact filmmaking stripped of any pretense, Eastwood infuses his controversial story with very little ambiguity. He stacks the deck so much in favor of the film's final thesis -- that assisted suicide with dignity is better than living out the rest of one's life in a paralyzed state -- that there's little room for argument. And the goonish caricatures he presents as Hilary Swank's trailer trash family are an embarrassment to his movie.This film clearly comes from a heartfelt place, but it's not without its flaws.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Emotionally shallow,"I really cannot understand all of the fuss about this movie. I saw it last night and I found it emotionally shallow, very predictable, and, although Eastwood directs with great skill, and many other elements are deftly contrived, the characters are so clichéd that that I found myself getting quite bored, and I stayed uninvolved throughout.The characterisations in particular were a joke - i,e, the forthright priest, the trailer trash family, and the scrawny kid in the Gym. Most of all the coach, played by Morgan Freeman was used in such a predictable way, and the 'villains' were so obvious, it was simply laughable. In short, what this film lacked was emotional honesty and some sense of reality. I would only rate this a 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Drama
Baby Is A Knock Out,"This movie is actually one of the best movies i have ever seen. I just watched it again tonight and I'm still in love with it. First off it is amazing how Hilary Swank became so fit to do this part, she plays the part like she was actually this person.It was all about passion, determination, perseverance, dedication, desire, and work. It is a very inspirational movie because of all these aspects. Maggie (Swank) shows that no matter what anyone says if you work you'll achieve.This personally motivated me to work a lot harder in my training. ""Play like your in first, train like your in second."" Even though Maggie was able to knock these girls out within 5 seconds of the first round she never quit training and practising. Great movie, the ending got a lot of heat saying it was bad but i don't think it could have been better. It was not corny which was surprising because most movies have these types of endings.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

The movie is very inspiring, it is a very good movie, 99% sure that it is the best movie of the year. Already won Golden Globe, has to get at least 3 Oscars for the Best film, The Actor and the Actress. Clint Eastwood was awesome, Hilary Swank made me cry, what else can I say.

"Million Dollar Baby: ""I Don't Train Girls""","Maggie Fitzgerald is a thirty-one year old amateur female boxer, and all she wants is a fighting chance. ""I don't train girls,"" says Frankie Dunn, a grizzled, but respected trainer who wants nothing to do with a girl fighter. With the help of Frankie's old partner and gym caretaker, Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris, they convince Frankie to coach and to be Maggie's manager. Frankie has a relationship problem with his long-lost daughter and adopts Maggie along with her career, until she is seriously injured in a fight for championship and Frankie has to make a decision.This movie was made in 2004 and directed by Clint Eastwood. Scrap (Morgan Freeman) is narrator through out this entire film. Maggie (Hilary Swank) is trying to escape her trailer-trash life and dysfunctional loser family. She accomplishes this by boxing, which she feels is her ""way out."" Frankie (Clint Eastwood) does not want to coach girls, but is finally convinced to not only coach Maggie, but also to become her manager. Maggie works very hard. She follows all Frankie's instructions, and does not ask any questions. When she finally starts fighting, she knocks out opponents in the first round. Soon nobody wants to fight her, so Frankie moves her up in class. She gets a fight against the champion, but everything goes wrong.This movie does not have one particular plot, but several subplots. Frankie has a long-lost relationship with his daughter. He is constantly writing her letters, but they are all sent back to him. Maggie has a dysfunctional family which she is trying to escape. She also has a dream of becoming a professional fighter. This movie shows me that great films do not need one storyline, just great actors and directing.This movie had excellent use of light and shade. There could not be any better characters put in one movie. I thought the part when Frankie asked Scrap why he had on socks with holes in them, his response was ""I like to get air to my feet at night,"" yet Frankie gave him money to buy socks, though the money made its way to the tracks. This movie will make a viewer laugh, cry, and be moved by this powerful boxing classic.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
realy good one.,"This movie is great..
but i just cant rewatch it..becouse it was so sad.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
I had an epiphany about this movie today,"And its Tea-Party roots.Basically, this movie was a tool used to inject poison. I'll get to that in a bit.This film was released at virtually the Nadir of some of the worst years, not of just my life, but of this nation.If we look at the events surrounding the year of it's release: US is embroiled in basically a war which our then-president caused over OIL. The Housing bubble had burst, and one year later, Bush's first attempts to privatize our social security system was put into effect, namely ""Medicare Part D"" which privatized a function of Social Security, took it AWAY from the State, and handed it directly to private entrepreneurs and Insurance Sharks. Many of our elderly went without medication for up to three years. If Part D were put on the table today exactly as it was in 2004, it would be rejected, because it is supposed to be ""Federal"". The reason why this I bring this up is because it was an issue during the time this movie was being made, it's director and writer believes in it, and mainly this movie attacks the idea of Social Security.So I watch this movie, and it actually did have some good things in it, ergo my 5 rating. For the first half at least, some of it was very good, because Chair-Talking' Clint actually is a talented director. But I thought I was watching a movie about a girl who liked Boxing and became a woman boxer. And it was interesting as that movie... Until Clint decides to speak to that empty chair for the first time.Suddenly, the film is no longer about a budding girl boxer, suddenly she is disabled, and her ""evil"" mother is fighting with Clint over her money (The mother who just so happens to be worried about losing her Social Security benefits because she is given a HOUSE).If a Disabled person, meaning a person dependent on Social Security to do things like get Medical Care, EAT, find transportation, etc (In other words, those things that people who are not disabled take for granted) - If suddenly were given a HOUSE like that, well for a fact there would be serious and instant consequences- They COULD lose their Social Security. Now, the mother is no angel, and has problems: But to be worried about losing Social Security is a dread fear for all people who get it. However, the woman did receive and act on bad advice from other family members. But Clint uses this one dysfunctional family to make all of Social Security look bad, attacking the recipients of it, in order to state his political views on not liking the system. Well, to hell with you, Clint! Basically, this film is a war about a girl's inheritance money - Should it be given to her Family, who does not seem to give a rip about the girl, or should her ""beloved"" trainer get it? The Problem is, regardless of how bad the mother appears, she was justified in being worried over losing her benefits. Simply put, Clint is not a valid person or director to put these elements into a movie, he's never had to LIVE on Social Security. Maybe at times he's had to get California Disability, but that's not the same thing- a person who is on Social Security can own a house, but to just be GIVEN a house is a serious problem.Perhaps if Clint had not made such a big deal in the movie about the mother's fear of Losing Benefits, but it just seemed to me, he went out of his way to make it into some kind of ""statement"". I mean, if the mother is a B****, then just have her be a B****. The whole thing about fear of losing Benefits had no place in this film.Now regarding the relationship Clint has with his Boxer played by Hilary Swank, I could believe that a bit. But that was at the very end of the movie, where his true feelings came out (He tells her what the Irish Slogan he had sewn on her robe meant). It would have been a better ending for a better movie had not Clint used the Anti-Medicare Detour to get there. Now, I've never read the stories that this is based upon, I don't know if the reactionary ideas were in the stories, or if Clint simply put them in. All I know is that this film uses those unfortunate events to make a system we depend on look bad.But this is just Par for Eastwood Movies these days, he is no longer interested in making any good Drama, he actually used to make films that supported the underdog, lately he makes films to support radical right wing reactionary ideas. But mostly he creates these huge canvases where he basically justifies telling a lie as the truth, like his latest sniper movie which gives his stamp of approval to the War in Iraq. I'd rather see him stick to Fiction.",5.0,Anonymous,Drama

"""Million Dollar Baby"" definitely on my Top Ten List.","""Million Dollar Baby,"" is an epic film directed by Clint Eastwood that has definitely sealed a spot in my ""Top Ten."" I, personally, am a Hillary Swank fan and she lives up to and excels her leading role as Maggie Fitzgerald, a woman coming from nothing to attempt to succeed in a mans sport that she loves. Maggie is working to live and then spends the rest of her time working out in the gym to become the best. This film is full of many different genres and feelings; drama, hope, despair, persistence, and even David vs. Goliath. Maggie isn't the youngest, the quickest, or the strongest, but what she lacks in skill, she compromises with her heart. So much heart, that the once stubborn Frankie Dunn, Clint Eastwood, agrees to become her trainer, even though she's a girl. Throughout the training and success of Maggie's career, they spark up a friendship as strong or even stronger than family.

That of a Sunday afternoon made-for-TV movie - decent production values, distinctly pedestrian script enthusiastically delivered in amateurish fashion (I know - shocking, considering the cast, but perhaps the tight filming schedule had something to do with it), and a hackneyed, seen-it-all-before plot.Let me try and draw on the positives: Morgan Freeman - sterling performance under trying circumstances... erm... that's about it, actually.

Eastwood at the top of his game,"A heartfelt portrait of the bond between a sun-setting boxing manager and his upstart apprentice, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is equal parts hopeful and energizing, and absolutely soul-crushing. I can say without exaggeration that this film wrecked me, and yet I cannot recommend it highly enough. Though the punches are gloved, this isn't really about boxing at all. This is a human drama, one-hundred percent, and the movie's all the better for it.This is the story of a young woman who knows her place in life is at the bottom and refuses to accept it. Her way out of poverty, physical weakness, and a wretched family is the boxing championship, and she fights harder than everyone around her to get there. I honestly feel that Maggie is the root of my love of strong female characters; she made a mark on me in 2004 and I haven't been able to shake it (would I really want to?). As incredible as Eastwood and Freeman are in this film, Hilary Swank personifies its heart and soul. She is on a whole different level here.Everything here, from the casting to performances and direction are handled with great care; and no matter how shocking this film may be, it never comes off as cheap or manipulative. Quite the opposite, I think this is one of the most moving films I have ever seen.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Million Dollar Experience,"Million Dollar Baby tells a story that hits the viewer hard upon first viewing, and while that initial feeling hurts, it's one that I believe everybody should experience because this is a story that's so refreshing to see unfold before your eyes. The writing is superb and masterfully tells the story of these characters, especially Maggie, because you feel like you're legitimately living with her and watching her go along this journey filled with defeat and disappointments before she finally starts achieving everything she's ever wanted. The score also works perfectly in tandem with the writing, and the acting is fantastic from everyone involved with the film, such as actors with smaller roles like Mike Colter, to the star, Hilary Swank. Everybody does a perfect job with their respective roles and really help to build out this world of the underground boxing scene and where these characters come from.However, this movie does have pacing issues, particularly towards the 3rd act of the film. The reason why pacing issues begin to develop towards the end is because the film is really attempting to draw out and elongate these interactions between two certain characters, which ultimately I feel like did more to hurt the emotional impact of the ending rather than help it.With that being said, this film is absolutely worth watching for anybody who enjoys a story about triumph, perseverance, boxing, or simply just quality storytelling. Just be wary of the last 25 minutes that end up feeling like 50, but the finale of this movie will leave you in a state of disbelief. I strongly recommend this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Ready-built for tragedy,"Story of a young, eager female boxer (Hilary Swank), her manager (Clint Eastwood, who also directed) and his assistant (Morgan Freeman) certainly impressed the Academy, winning four Oscars out of seven nominations. Eastwood's directing career has brought forth some very spotty pictures; when he loses his dryly-askew sense of humor, the filmmaker can get awfully one-dimensional. ""Million Dollar Baby"" comes ready-built for tragedy. It has sympathetic characters, strong performances from its cast, and an intriguing scenario that doesn't initially appear to follow a well-trodden formula. However, by the second-half, both Mike Haggis' screenplay (adapted from F. X. Toole's ""Rope Burns"" stories) and Eastwood's agenda have changed dramatically--from a character portrait into a wallow (it's never quite a ""boxing moving"", per se). Haggis seems to be saying that life is rough--for the girl, for her manager, for the assistant, and for the (God help us) mental kid who hangs out at the gym in a gratuitous subplot (designed to give mentor Freeman a few extra scenes). It's an occasionally unpleasant and queasy picture which skirts soap opera territory. Eastwood is an intelligent and caring actor-director (who also provides the somber, quietly effective mood music on the soundtrack), and yet the assembly-line progression of situations here are disappointingly trotted out. The finale is indeed moving, but the set-up for it is almost mechanical. ** from ****",5.0,Anonymous,Drama

I was very moved and broken-hearted by the turn of events and haven't felt so overwhelming sad over a movie in decades. Morgan Freeman's voice-over narration is a bit hard to hear at times and Clint's gruff voice is hard to understand at times. It's a slow-paced movie but always manages to keep your interest.

Three-Disc DVD Set Highlights An Eastwood Masterwork With a Powerful Turn by Swank,"It has been quite a few years since Clint Eastwood was reamed by critics for starring and sometimes directing ultra-violent vigilante action thrillers. What they neglected to acknowledge is that Eastwood has always had a strong sense of story, and age has really sharpened his film-making techniques to a deeply resonant emotional level without the need for gimmickry or special effects. Nowhere is his immense talent more evident than in this acclaimed 2004 film, a low-key, patiently paced, three-person drama that takes a surprising turn that lifts the movie into something quite extraordinary. The only significant thing miscalculated is the movie's title, which seems almost too comically ironic for such an enriching film.Written by Paul Haggis (""Crash""), the basic story is simple, almost deceptively corny sounding a bit like the distaff version of ""Rocky"". A spunky female fighter from the wrong side of the tracks, Maggie Fitzgerald, wants a grizzled old trainer, Frankie Dunn, to guide her to become a professional boxer. Of course, the trainer owns a third-rate gym with an array of male fighters encompassing all the stereotypes. He also has an aged assistant, Scrap, who is of course, willing to champion Maggie's potential more than Frankie, at least at the beginning. Eastwood, however, belies the predictability and takes his story to a far deeper and more nuanced level than one would presume from this set-up. It turns out that Maggie is pushing 32 and considered over-the-hill for getting into the game. Frankie is estranged from his daughter, reads Yeats, studies Gaelic and goes to Mass every day mostly to annoy the young priest. Scrap was a contender trained by Frankie but lost an eye and his boxing future when a match went awry.How these three characters interact with each other supplies the film's main pleasure, not really the obligatory boxing scenes that will assuredly make one wince by their realism. In fact, one of the more painful scenes in the movie is not in the boxing ring but in a new house that Maggie buys for her ungrateful mother, when Maggie comes to the revelation that she has no one but Frankie to provide emotional support in her life. This is not to say the film lacks humor, as Eastwood infuses a clever sensibility that subtly draws you into these characters' lives without hesitation. The story follows Maggie's ascension in the boxing world, and what happens beyond that development is devastating. While it is enough to say there is tragedy involved, leave it to Eastwood, in his straightforward, confident directorial approach, to make the last part of the story surprisingly life-affirming and not at all exploitative. Only a film-making master could pull off such a feat in such an honest and emotionally affecting manner.As an actor, Eastwood continues to impress primarily by his innate connection to Frankie. Probably not since his surprisingly open-hearted turn in ""The Bridges of Madison County"" has he made himself so vulnerable on screen, granted this time under the veneer of his hard-earned, leather-faced machismo. His sense of authority is never in question here, and he shows it off with great relish, especially as his character realizes how much more complicated life becomes as he grows older. Morgan Freeman plays Scrap with his customary humanistic skill. In fact, he provides the narration as a voice-over letter to Frankie's daughter in a manner that will remind you of his similar turn in ""The Shawshank Redemption"". That's not to say his performance is unsurprising, as he and Eastwood have an easy rapport that plays to both actors' strengths. But the standout is Hilary Swank portraying Maggie with an emotional directness and piercing vulnerability that cuts right to the heart. Not only is she physically impressive in the gym and in the ring, but she elevates what could have been a one-note character into someone far more complex, intelligent and affecting. The film is wonderfully profound with superlative acting.The three-disc 2005 DVD set is solid but rather light on extras. Disc One contains a pristine print transfer of the film but no commentaries from Eastwood or the cast. There are three extras on Disc Two. The first is an 18-minute featurette, ""Born to Fight"", which features interviews with the three stars and three other cast members, in particular, boxer/actor Lucia Rijker (who plays Maggie's fatalistic opponent) who discusses the ways in which the film parallels her career in boxing. The second is ""The Producers' Round 15"", a 13-minute short on the film's production process featuring Haggis, as well as producers Albert Ruddy and Tom Rosenberg. The last extra is a roundtable discussion, ""James Lipton Takes on Three"" with the three stars being interviewed in typical sequestered fashion by the erudite host of ""Inside the Actors' Studio"". Disc Three is the soundtrack CD of Eastwood's atmospheric musical score orchestrated by Lennie Niehaus conducting the Hollywood Studio Symphony.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"A very depressing, yet fresh punch of filmmaking.","Clint Eastwood remains and is still known as a legendary person. He's acted in terrific films like 'Unforgiven' and 'The Good, Bad, and Ugly', as well as directed 'Mystic River' and 'Unforgiven'. You CANNOT despise him of his works, because they are all fresh pieces of art. I had high expectations for this film and it succeeded thoroughly, but in a very grief way.'Million Dollar Baby' is a fresh punch in the face with a total knockout. It features outstanding performances; as well as a trustworthy script. Unfortunately, it falls under a film I won't see again, because of the depressing atmosphere...Acting is basically the category that really makes this film. Eastwood, Swank, and Freeman give staggering performances with lots of characterization. Eastwood is a true genius; he plays 'Frankie' with aggressiveness, courage, and confidence. What a show! Swank is almost better than him; shady, determined; and achieved. Freeman is probably the best; a great narrator, showcased, and calm.The script is 'second-best'. Joining forces with the incredible acting; it really works. Again, lots of credit towards Eastwood.Depression though cannot be under defined. The film is thoroughly grief-full and a bit of a set back. Basically, tearful and the only thing I didn't like about this film.Overall, if you are a movie-goer, go see it right now; you won't be disappointed. Though, be WARNED; its depressing and will make you cry. Clint Eastwood really is even more achieving with this film...",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
hopeless ending,"hello everyone .. casting, script was great particularly the act of the Hilary Swank as not only a fighter,but accent and her facial expression was so great. in the movie it is really encouraging her heart and motivation and drew a target for herself regardless of her age and by her hardworking she could reach whatever wanted in a short period of time because of being determined and clear path she had. til here movie is 10, but at the end after breaking her spinal (not considering what caused it and actually she was the winner ,but some gutless couldn't beat her in during the game) she lost her spirit and asked for death, and it could end with natural death after the incident with strength and her sense of humor and kindness.that's why I gave 7 for the discouraging and so sad ending.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Not as great as I expected!,"i went to see this film expecting it to be amazing like a lot of people say but, having seen it i would rate it as an average film.The first problem is that the acting is so underplayed that, as an audience member, i found it hard to really feel any connection to the characters. If i had, perhaps i would have cried but i didn't, i just felt like a distanced spectator. Clint Eastwood, as a withdrawn boxing owner played his part well, the problem was just that, he was withdrawn. Realism in film is good to a point, here it was overdone.However the film was well made and kept my attention throughout. Hilary Swanks portrayal of a gutsy boxer probably does deserve an Oscar nomination.Overall a good film, but overrated, and there are films/actors out there far more deserving of academy awards - not that that makes a difference.",,Anonymous,Drama
This picture is worth a million dollars,"Believe the hype about this movie. Eastwood has not only directed one of the finest movies to date, but he as well has shown incredibly deep emotion in his own character. Million Dollar Baby gives true insight to life lessons that go beyond the mere comedy or action that is in this picture (which does entertain). This is what the really good movies are about. This raw emotion is what gives people something to talk about afterward and will stay with you for awhile. Hilary Swank gives an incredible performance that will undoubtedly propel her career, and Morgan Freeman continues to become the best supporting actor ever (see top 250: Unforgiven and Shawshank Redemption).",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

One punch and one knocked out,"I read a lot of reviews on million dollar babe and i havan't read on bad yet and i hope i'm never going to read one bad on this movie.This movie is probable the best movie of 2004.Clint Eastwood did a very good job directing this movie.If Clint is planning on stopping directing movies or acting in movies, million dollar babe should not be the last one.All i can say about this movie is the acting of this entertaining movie.The acting in this movie could'nt be any better except for Maggie Fitzgerald's (Hilary Swank) family members, Earline Fitzgerald (Margo Martindale), Mardell Fitzgerald (Riki Lindhome).Those two actors wasn't that great in this movie but it still made a very good movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A brutally realistic tale not suitable for all viewers,"Hilary Swank won her second Best Actress Oscar for her performance as Maggie Fitzgerald, woman boxer, in this outstanding movie directed and produced by Clint Eastwood. Her first was for Boys Don't Cry (1999). It's clear she put a lot of work into the part and was outstanding and clearly deserved the award. The movie is one of Clint Eastwood's best. I would not however recommend that everybody see this. The latter part of the movie is brutal and the ending is not pretty.Morgan Freeman as Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, a tough-as-nails veteran of 109 fights and owner of only one working eye, narrates part of the action as the jack of all duties at the Hit Pit Gym for boxing hopefuls run by Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood). Scrap is addressing somebody. At the end of the film we find out who (but of course I can't say). This is a nice touch that adds some depth to the theme of the movie which is the love that exists (or should) between a father and a daughter.Clint Eastwood plays the father figure to Swank's irrepressible Maggie, ambitious trailer trash girl with a heart as strong as a bull. Eastwood's Frankie Dunn is a deeply troubled man who is continually writing to his daughter only to have the letters always come back unopened with the words ""Return to Sender"" on them. Apparently Frankie did something so bad that his daughter will no longer have anything to do with him. I didn't notice that we ever find out what this something was, but it doesn't matter. Frankie's character is such that we forgive him even if his daughter doesn't.The story starts out like any one of a hundred Hollywood fight movies with the difference being the boxer is a woman. But the story does not end like a ""Rocky"" contrivance. Instead Eastwood and Paul Higgis, who wrote the heart-wrenching script, opt for a kind of stark realism that will not please some people. There is the sense that this could really happen and is the kind of tragedy that Shakespeare and the Greek dramatists would appreciate.But the tragedy is not Maggie Fitzgerald's alone. It is also Frankie's. And it is Scrap-Iron's as well. If only Frankie had not trained her. If only Scrap-Iron had gone to Vegas for the title fight and been in her corner. If only Scrap-Iron had not encouraged Maggie. ""If only,"" like so much of life, has no meaning after the fact of what actually happens. Scrap wants to believe that Maggie was the better for having really lived and had a chance at a great personal triumph; and even Maggie herself seems to at least want to believe that. Frankie however is clearly not in agreement.At the end Frankie, who is a lifelong Catholic who goes to church every Sunday and is looking for the meaning of life, must face a terrible dilemma. Maggie asks him to do something that he cannot do, that goes against his religion. Yet he feels he must do it.How one interprets the ending--did he do the right thing?--may very well determine whether one likes the film or not. His moral dilemma is very real and I, for one, cannot say what I would have done in his situation, and so for me the horns of the dilemma are very sharp indeed.I quit watching boxing on TV many ago because of the way the fights excite the blood, since the point of a boxing match is to make the opponent helpless. I don't like feeling like that. This movie, in a way, perhaps accidentally, comes to the same end as many a fight: the winner goes on to another fight, and to an eventual loss, while the loser is made helpless.Some people might be wondering what the message here is. I'm not sure, but I can tell you this: Shakespeare essentially said there is no message. Life is tale told by an idiot...in the end signifying nothing. And the existentialists will tell you that life has no meaning except for that which we ourselves bestow upon it. I guess Scrap is the existentialist and Frankie the Shakespearean.And who is Maggie? And who is everywoman and everyman?(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

I could not believe it..,"I saw this movie recently and with all the high praises (and Oscars) that its gotten i was really very excited to see this film, especially since i'm a boxing fan. However, by the end of the movie i was wondering if i saw the same movie everyone was talking about. To be honest i was disappointed with it. For a casual fan the boxing aspects of the movie might be okay but for a boxing aficionado they are not.. There are things happening (esp. inside the ring) on the movie that are simply unbelievable, you might even say its out of the world, and for that its just hard to love this movie. Now i'm sure people will point out that this is not a movie about boxing; this is a movie about People, about Relationships, and i get that. The thing is boxing is what holds the movie together, from the principal characters to the main scenes, and i just wish it was done better and realistically. PS I can't believe this won the Oscars for the best picture.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Thou shalt not kill,"Watching this I kept thinking 'oh this is really great, Eastwood is great, the girl is excellent,,,.........etc etc' Then suddenly it was if someone pulled the plug on the film and it sunk to an absolute crummy dead end around half an hour before the finish. It's hard these days to watch any Hollywood film without realising you're being propagandised somehow. Some rich and powerful people want the power of life and death over you and they're using the media as a way to bring the subject of euthanasia up in order to familiarise you with the concept that killing is OK under certain circumstances. I've seen loads of articles recently in the news such as 'The case for killing Granny' and others. Sorry, but killing is killing is killing and thou should not kill. End of. So they serve up the 'exception' to the rule ie. in this case it's a merciful thing to do. But as we all know and especially alcoholics know, the exception to the rule can rapidly become the rule. Before you know it they'll be popping you off 'cause your insurance ran out just like they pop off unborn babies for free 'cause you don't want the hassle of looking after one. Hell, life is cheap these days didn't you know? Also they brought the Church in on this one to get the Christians on board too. Nothing Hollywood puts out these days is just innocent entertainment. It all has a political message. They want your mind. And what was the dumb white boy there for? 'Oh we're all fighters and it's the spirit of fighting that counts even if you're really a sorry stupid loser.'= be a loser and let us have control over you. Apart from anything else these subjects do not make good drama. Maybe the key to realising the propaganda part is being pushed is to know when you're feeling bored suddenly. Another intelligence insult. Another one for the recycle bin.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Probably the Greatest Film on Boxing, Period","This has to be one of, if not, the finest films ever done on the sport of boxing. The fight scenes are great, but its the gentler moments between Hillary Swank and Clint Eastwood that help make this film what it is. However, the true glue of this film is Morgan Freeman. He definitely provides a true center as the narrator of the story. It is his gentle nature that helps make this film an all time classic. Also, this is a great story about relationships. You pretty much can see this as Frankie pretty much establishes with Maggie, the relationship that he wishes that he could have had with his own daughter. This relationship really comes to a head especially at the end.The other thing that I really liked about the film is that unlike most boxing films, it doesn't end with the big bout that sees her win the title and become champion. Instead, it uses that scene to pretty much set up the real strong part of the film. This film is definitely a great film not only on boxing, but on relationships as well.",,Anonymous,Drama
A Most Wonderful movie,"This is one of the most wonderful movies I've seen in recent times. Kudos to Hillary Swank and Clint Eastwood. Morgan Freeman, as always is at his very best.The screenplay of Paul Haggis has kept me guessing all the time. This film does not attempt to satisfy the viewer with a cheap happy ending. But at the end the viewer is bound to feel contented with the effect that it leaves on the mind. This will leave an indelible mark in the history of Hollywood films. Clint Eastwood, no doubt has positioned himself as one of the great directors of this time with this classic form of art at its very best. This is a must see film for all who nurture the passion in the visual form of motion picture.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Eastwood's emotional rollercoaster baby!,"My Rating : 8/10Winner of four Academy Awards, Million Dollar Baby starts off as a tale of determination to chase your dreams but it ends in a sad tale of dealing with difficult situations and the power of friendship. The film's brilliance earned Eastwood his second Oscar for his work behind the camera, it helped that in front of the camera he was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role and was paired with Hillary Swank who won for Best Actress and the always wonderful Morgan Freeman who won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. A film about boxing that is also an emotional rollercoaster.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Eastwood does it again!,"First of all I just wanna say that I hate everything about sports and the reason why I wanted to see it is because Clint Eastwood directed it. And after seeing Mystic River, I wanted to see Million Dollars Baby cause Clint Eastwood is an incredible director that brings the actors in his movies in good light. I had only seen Hilary Swank in Boys don't cry so I didn't knew much about her but she just blew me away. They way she talked and living herself into that part were just amazing. I believed her. She's brilliant for being so young. And giving her an Oscar was the right thing to do. Also, Morgan Freeman. He's so ordinary in that movie and brilliant. You just wanna feel sorry for him for being so alone in the movie. I mean living in the gym? Who wants that? The story is gripping and you just wanna comfort them all. Everything in that movie is so human. It's all about making it through the day no matter how hard that is. And sometimes, you just want it all to take it all in the end but you just need a little help to make that happen. It's all about that. It makes you think what would I've done if I was him or her.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Great Film,"Maggie (played by Hilary Swank) takes us on an amazing journey as she tries to work her way up to becoming a professional women boxer in Million Dollar Baby. Frankie (played by Clint Eastwood) is a straight to the point out of date trainer, who Maggie only wants to have train her. The main focus of the film is watching Maggie as she develops into a professional boxer while also shedding light onto Frankie and his side story with his daughter. The viewers are drawn into and develop along side of these characters only to be setup for a brutal end. You become closer to Maggie as you see how everyone else in her family holds zero to no hope for her and only care about themselves. You become stronger as Maggie does as she shows a strong determination and drive even when people tell her she can't do it or it can't be done. As the film progresses you start to understand how Frankie became the way he has and understand why be starts to open up to Maggie and treats her like his own daughter and him as her father. This film has many ties back to Rocky as far as the boxing aspect of the film. You are pulling for the underdog and you are alongside them as they grow as a person, but that is where the ties end. Million Dollar Baby will find you heart strings and take you on an emotional journey one with many highs and lows and make you come out on the other side asking how I got here. Must see.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of the best films I've seen in recent times. I recommend!,"I was truly impressed with this film. It is one of the most impressive and intense that I have seen in a while and I believe that it couldn't have had any other destiny than winning the Oscar for Best Motion Picture, in that distant year of 2005. Its also, for me and until now, the best film by Clint Eastwood, where he not only plays one of the most important and complex roles, but also directs. Remarkable!The film is basically about a young girl from very modest backgrounds who finds her life's course in boxing. The problem is that she is a woman, and all boxing academies reject her because of that. However, she will be able to capture the attention of two coaches, former retired boxers, who accept the task of training and teaching her, each of whom has a past linked to boxing and very complex personal lives. To knew more, its best to see the film, its worth every minute.Clint Eastwood is the man here. He had already proven himself to be a great actor and great director, that wasn't new when he released this film, but it is difficult to conceive of something that can be even better than this. Eastwood's skilful hand and attentive and detailed style are everywhere and earned him the Oscar for Best Director that year, with all merit and fairness. The script, based on tales by F.X. Toole, was written by Paul Haggis and is excellent. And here I think Eastwood took a chance, given that Haggis had made a career as a screenwriter more associated with television than cinema. But the risk was well rewarded, and the proof is Haggis' collaboration on several Eastwood films from then on.The cast is not very large and that is a good thing, as it gave the actors time and space to shine. The star is Clint Eastwood, who plays a tough guy with feelings and an unresolved past. Next to her is Hillary Swank, a young actress full of personality and who had already shone in ""The Next Karate Kid"", also in a female action character. She was impressive and reached here one of the pinnacles of her career, winning the Oscar for Best Actress for the second time, which is always impressive for an actor. Another actor who deserves a note in this film, and who managed to collect the Oscar for Best Secondary Actor, is the impeccable and already veteran Morgan Freeman. However, and despite being a great actor, this was the only award that the Hollywood Academy has given him so far.Technically it is an impeccable film. Cinematography provides us with excellent footage and a masterful use of colour, shadow and contrast to express and amplify feelings and moods. The sets and costumes are excellent. The sound effects and soundtrack, very discreet, fulfil their function with merit but without taking our attention away from the story told. The post-production work was also done with care and attention.Anyone who says that this film is just a boxing film is totally wrong and made a reductive reading of this film. Its a film based on boxing, but it goes far beyond that, offering us much more: a story of poverty, ambition, greed; a story of dreams that are gradually crushed, punch by punch, by the harshness of life and reality; a story about pain, death and loss, in which highly pertinent and debatable moral questions are raised.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
