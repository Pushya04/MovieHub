Underrated,This is an underrated gem. I don't really know why it doesn't get the praise that it deserves,8.0,Anonymous,History
A REAL CINEMATIC TIME MACHINE!,"TROY is More than just a movie, TROY is a species of time machine. In a most compelling and exciting way, it will transport you to a time and place far away! To the Greek islands of over three millennia ago, to be precise!For those of you with a good Home Theater, this film will provide two hours of historical battles, conducted in a very realistic and impressive way, spectacular vistas of both land and sea, seamless digital effects that are difficult to distinguish from reality, and for women, a well-oiled Brad Pitt projecting a multifaceted and enigmatic Achilles, whose performance was highly underrated by critics.In contrast, Orlando Bloom (Lord of the Rings , Pirates of the Caribbean) as Paris was somewhat indecipherable, leaving one with the question of whether the lack of character in his portrayal of Paris, was intentional or due to an underpar performance. The rest of the cast appears to be generally well chosen (with the exception of Diane Kruger in the role of Elena, who looked like a mechanical porcelain figurine) and bestows a resonance and a dimension to this historical drama rarely seen in a movie of this genre.As announced in the end credits, TROY was ""inspired"" by Homer's Iliad, authored some 2,500 years ago. It's hard to understand the logic of ""purists"", who have cried ""FOUL!"" because Troy's plot often differs notably from Homer's original work. They complain that the movie is neither faithful to the Iliad nor to history. Well, the fact that the HUNDREDS of gods and demigods present in the book are absent from the movie is, perhaps, not necessarily a bad thing!... When You think about it!As for historical events themsleves, nobody really knows for sure what happened in Troy three thousand two hundred years ago! Practically everything is purely conjecture! So consider that TROY is a completely separate film version, with a different name, of the written work, the Iliad.It is worth making a few comments on some technical aspects of the production : costume design, scenography, weapons, boats and other elements of war demonstrate a work done taking its time, with enough love and an almost obsessive attention to an endless number of details, almost impossible to see and perceive clearly the first time you see the movie, but that REALLY stand out during a second viewing!There have been many works where the Seventh Art has spent a fortune, and the result ends up being anything but artistic! In the case of TROY, at least, it seems that the budget of $200 million has presented us with a very harmonious and esthetic result!Even the AUDIO, for those who are set on these things, is some of the best that has been produced so far for DVD! We must recognize the director, Wolfgang Peterson (Das Boot, Air Force One , The Perfect Storm) which reached an orchestrated, intense, clear and consistent cinematic vision of TROY!A final recommendation.... Despite the fact that TROY, really lacks any scenes of graphic violence, much less any sexually charged ones, because of the amoral, indecisive and unfocused tone of some of its protagonists, it would probably be a good idea to do a pre-screening with family and friends over 12, and then decide if you deem it suitable for younger people in your family!.Hoping you really enjoy your two and a half hours in the city of TROY, in the second millennium before Christ ... and do not forget to PUMP UP THE VOLUME !!!8******** ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA!Any Comments, Questions or Observations...in ENGLISH o en ESPAÑOL, are most WELCOME!",8.0,Anonymous,History
Entertaining,"People give this movie too much hate for being ""not entirely accurate to the Iliad"" or whatever. But In reality, I don't think there's ever a time I haven't been impressed when watching scenes from this movie. Some are emotional, most action packed, and most importantly makes Achilles look badass (as it should). But all in all movie quality or not, this film is entertaining.",8.0,Anonymous,History
One of my favorite movies,"I love this movie, by far my favorite R rated movie and in the running for one of the greatest and most epic in my opinion. The acting, the world-building, the character depth, and the thrill of such an incredible depiction of the time period. I didn't think it was possible to make an accounting of the Trojan war void of the supernatural presence of the Greek Gods that rivals the old story in excellence, but this movie does.",,Anonymous,History
very surprised !!!,"Well well,.................. expected the worse because of hype, but i was gladly surprised . Screenplay , direction and most of all Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Brian Cox, and Peter o'Toole were completely on top of their game, even Olando Bloom as the love sick coward Paris was very watchable.Fight scenes were not overdone, and the love scenes were part of but didn't completely rule the story of Troy which I also liked. If any thing else Troy will go down as having one of the most impressive fight scenes of any film in history. The fight between Hector and Achilles is reason enough to watch Troy alone...",7.0,Anonymous,History
It's just a movie,"I'm sick of all the bad reviews for this movie. I really don't give a damn if it's true to the Iliad or not. The movie is extremely entertaining. I really like the fact that the gods are downplayed in this movie. It makes the story a lot more realistic. The acting was good. The story was good. The dialogue was good. The action scenes were good. I really can't see what's not to like in this movie. I guess I could pick it apart and find flaws, but I could do that with every movie ever made. For those upset by the fact that there was no definite good side or bad side, I have some shattering news. In war, there is never a good side or bad side. War is all subjective depending on whose side you are on. Every side thinks they are the good guys. A lot of people were upset about Paris, who is cast as a coward, becoming heroic in the end. Like it or not, we all have cowardliness and heroism within us. We just don't like to admit it. So, ignore the critics and watch this movie. Remember, critics have an opinion just like everyone else and as the old saying goes, opinions are like a**holes. Everyone has one and a lot of them stink. You don't have to agree with me, but don't let someone else make up your mind for you either.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"""Where does it end?"" -- ""It never ends.""","If Homer's mythical epic ""The Iliad"" is based on a factual story, that story is magnificently depicted in Wolfgang Petersen's 2004 epic ""Troy."" In other words, don't expect any goofy 'gods' or 'goddesses' like Athena popping out of thin air because ""Troy"" is a realistic portrayal of the Trojan war.More than that, ""Troy"" is arguably the best sword & sandal epic ever put to film. You name the picture -- ""Samson and Delilah,"" ""Spartacus,"" ""Ben-Hur,"" ""Ulysses,"" ""The Viking Queen,"" ""Conan the Barbarian,"" ""Braveheart,"" ""Attila,"" ""The Odyssey,"" ""Gladiator,"" etc. -- ""Troy"" is superior. At the very least it's as good as some of the better flicks just noted, like ""Ben-Hur,"" and far edges out ""Spartacus"" and ""Samson and Delilah."" As for more recent sword & sandal epics, like the overrated ""Braveheart"" or ""Gladiator,"" ""Troy"" blows 'em out of the water.Roger Ebert is a great writer and critic, but his mediocre review of ""Troy"" is all wrong. Ebert's major criticisms, believe it or not, are the main reasons I have such high respect for this film: He complains that Petersen omitted the many Greek 'gods' & 'goddesses' and gripes that the actors perform their roles as believable people and not larger-than-life caricatures. This can, of course, be respectably done, as in the 1955 film ""Ulysses,"" but this is not what Petersen was shooting for in ""Troy."" His goal, as already noted, was to depict the actual Trojan War on which Homer's myth is based. (Even if it never really took place, wars LIKE IT did).Regarding Brad Pitt's heavily criticized performance as Achilles, I couldn't care less about Pitt until seeing this movie as he does an outstanding job portraying Greece's greatest warrior. No, he's not the bulkiest warrior to ever grace the earth, but he's fast as lightning, confident, expertly skilled and deadly accurate. Even his voice completely fits the role. Eric Bana (from ""Hulk"") is also great as Hector, Achilles' Trojan counterpart, who's sick of war and just wants to live a life of peace with his family. These two have a showdown in the film and it is without a doubt the greatest mano-a-mano sword & sandal duel ever filmed.What's interesting about the picture is that you never really end up rooting for one side or the other. When Achilles and Hector have their powerful face-off, my wife and I couldn't decide for whom to root. Maybe that's the point. Don't get me wrong, Agamemnon could be viewed as the villain in this picture, and I wasn't rooting for Menelaus when he fights Paris (Orlando Bloom, who seduces Helen, Menelaus' wife), but neither the Greeks nor the Trojans are painted as the 'good guys' or 'bad guys.' They're just people at war, and in war there's no real glory, as Hector points out... and it never ends, as Achilles states. An additional point is that living in a state of war is a JOYLESS existence. And both Bana and Pitt get this across well.As for beautiful women, there are only a couple mentionable: Diane Kruger plays Helen, ""the face that launched a thousand ships."" Some have complained that she's too plain for the role, but I disagree. I'm not a fan of hers or anything, but she looks pretty dang sharp to me (not to mention has an impressive behind shot). Besides, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. If Paris deems her worthy of starting a war, who are we to disagree? Also on hand is cutie Rose Byrne who plays Briseis, the virgin priestess whom Achilles converts to the pleasures of the flesh.I should point out that ""Troy"" was one of the most expensive pictures ever made at the time and it definitely SHOWS on the screen. Make no mistake, ""Troy"" is breath-taking just to WATCH -- the colossal armies, ships and battles are awe-inspiring to behold, not to mention the Maltan and Mexican locations. And the CGI effects are outstanding for the time, not fake-looking like the Rome & Coliseum scenes in ""Gladiator.""Another complaint by Ebert is that the dialogue is lousy; nothing could be further from the truth. There are great pieces of dialogue interspersed throughout, including Achilles' comment that the 'gods' envy people because we're mortal and ""Everything's beautiful because we're doomed."" Thankfully, there's not one goofy one-liner anywhere to be found.James Horner's score should also be mentioned. If you enjoyed the soundtrack of ""The Passion of the Christ"" you'll love this one because it's just as good/serious/reverent/powerful. For instance, the intense percussion during Achilles and Hector's showdown is magnificent.Interestingly, Brad Pitt, who plays Achilles, injured his Achilles tendon during shooting. Fitting, no?FINAL WORD: If you're in the mood for a sword & sandal epic, ""Troy"" more than fills the bill. The story captivates from the get-to and never lets up the entire 2.5 hour runtime (technically 2 hours, 42 minutes, with credits). It extravagantly visualizes the Trojan War for you, something I never did until seeing this mind-blowing, outstanding piece of cinema.GRADE: A+",10.0,Anonymous,History
Proof that critics should be ignored,"I finally got to see this movie in the bargain theaters here in El Paso on Labor Day. I originally hadn't thought much about the movie, but as time went on it had left the regular theaters here in town and I realized that I'd wished I'd gone to see it. I remember hearing several outside critics blasting the movie as horrible and wanted to judge for myself. I'm very glad I finally saw this movie.This movie is not the usual Clash of the Titans/Jason and the Argonauts type of movie where the gods are constantly shown and portrayed as more important and powerful than the lowly humans. In fact, this movie completely ignores the so-called gods and instead places the focus where it belongs -- on the warriors themselves. I have studied the Iliad as well as other stories surrounding the mythical Trojan War since my days as an elementary school geek obsessed with mythology and Dungeons & Dragons. Instead of being targeted toward that audience this film demystifies the Trojan War and treats it in a manner in which it could have actually happened. We see that the elders who continually refer to their so-called gods come across as fools. One of the most telling lines is when Hector (Eric Bana) refers to the fact that Apollo did not strike down Achilles (Brad Pitt) for desecrating the statue. It is very telling that Hector seems to doubt the gods he has been taught to worship.I have been a longtime critic of Brad Pitt as a second-tier talent who became famous only because of his looks, but in this film he surprised me. He is the TRUE star of the film. Achilles is easily the most interesting and entertaining character. I applaud Brad Pitt's effort in making his character a tragic hero. Achilles acknowledges that he is NOT the son of a goddess and is not immortal or invulnerable. The movie basically shows us how a rumor can blossom into a legend unto itself. Achilles' legend BECOMES immortal. He even refers to this in my favorite scene when he is inspiring his men and starts the invasion heavily outnumbered and still triumphs. Later in the same scene he scoffs at the so-called gods the Greeks and Trojans worship by decapitating the statue. I found this scene symbolic of the movie itself. The gods are nothing to both the characters and audience.Instead of supernatural powers and impossible feats we're treated to realism. Even Achilles' death is more realistic than in the myth. In the myth Paris does kill Achilles with an arrow, but because he has no battle skills his hand is actually guided by Apollo.If there was one thing I did not like in this film it was the transformation of Paris into some kind of hero. Paris was a coward in the original myth and I saw no reason to transform him into an overnight hero in the movie. I guess Orlando Bloom fans wouldn't be able to bear seeing him as the bad guy and were given the uninspired transformation of Paris into a better archer than Robin Hood.While this movie was nowhere near the epic masterpiece that the producers had hoped or that it was advertised as, it did not deserve the bad publicity it received from critics. I applaud the makers of this film and look forward to buying it on DVD.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Overwhelming and breathtaking epic film with all-star-cast.,"It's a great adventure movie that offers a wide range of impressive expectations in the epic genre. This historical movie deals with Troy war as a mamouth adaptation from classic poem written by Homer. Helena (Diane Kruger) , wife of Menelao of Sparta (Brendan Gleeson) , escapes with Paris (Orlando Bloom underwent archery training for his role as Legolas in Lord of the rings, 2001, and its two sequels). The Greek Army and ships go to Troya with Aquiles (Brad Pitt who trained for six months to get a body that looked like that of Greek statues), the king of Micenas , Agamenón (Brian Cox) , and the Spartans . They battle king of Troya (Peter O'Toole) and his sons : Héctor (Eric Bana) and Paris.Wolfgang Petersen's film benefited itself from the considerable effect ""Ridley Scott's Gladiator"" and offered the possibility of expanding commercial horizons towards a movie that achieved a big commercial success, including a cast of thousands . The hand of the director carries out an interesting story as well as thrilling and unsweetened, reasoning the causes and motivations of their roles , taking their time and giving large doses of artistic genius . If you are accustomed to battles as Braveheart or Gladiator, you will enjoy with ""Troy"", a great epic that shows the limits of the legend , which allowed Petersen to take some particular elements based on the ""Illiad"" of Homer. The battles are breathtaking, thousands of extras took part though mostly were staged by means of computer generator. The tale is pretty violent , the struggles are very bloody and savage , in fact , Brad Pitt and Eric Bana did not use stunt doubles for their epic duel. The main cast is made up of big names who give acceptable acting . Support cast is frankly good, such as Sean Bean , Garrett Hedlund , James Cosmo , Saffron Burrows , Trevor Eve , Nathan Jones , Nigel Terry , Vincent Regan , Tylor Mane and veteran Julie Christie . The movie is rated ¨R¨ for violence , profanity ,and brutal combats and that's why it isn't available for children , neither very early teenagers . Film direction by Wolfgang Petersen was well made, cinematography by cameraman Roger Deakins is excellent and musical score by prestigious composer James Horner is spectacular, the latter composed the soundtrack in less than 6 weeks . Rating 7/10 above average.This events about 'Troy war"" have been adapted on various films : Silent movie titled ¨The Private life of Helen of Troy¨ by Michael Curtiz 1927 with Maria Corda , Lewis Stone ; Hollywood/Italian version ¨Helen of Troy¨ 1956 by Robert Wise with Jacques Sernas , Rosana Podesta, Stanley Baker, Harry Andrews, Brigitte Bardot ; Italian version 1962 ¨War of Troy¨ by Giorgio Ferroni with Steve Reeves , Juliette Mayniel, Lidia Alfonsi, Mimmo Palmara ; Italian recounting titled ¨Fury of Achilles¨ by Marino Girolami with Gordon Mitchell , Jacques Bergerac , Gloria Milland , Ennio Girolami .

Still love this movie,"Watched this movie last night. Had not seen it for years. Loved it then and loved it now. Yes, the acting is a bit naff but seriously what a movie. It really is a historical war movie rather tran an action flick. The battle and fights scenes are superb, some of the best you will see. The costumes, set design and CGI are excellent. Everything is bathed in glorious sunshine, I don't know how anyone can really knock it. It also does challenge you on who to support. The Greeks kind of go looking for war but at the same time it was the wimp Paris who ran off with Helen. The Trojan's don't want to fight but at the same time Paris did instigate it. Hector is the most noble but then stupidly steps into his brothers duel to save him, ending the one chance of peace Troy has. As for Achilles, well he is super cool and moody. Don't bother taking sides, just enjoy the sun.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Troy: The Good and The Bad...,"The Good: Peter O'Toole Sean Bean Eric Bana Rose Byrne Brian Cox Fight SequencesThe Bad: Some of the dialogue THE MUSIC! (So disappointing considering how good the music in the trailer is)There have been a lot of reviews making very sweeping statements about this movie. Especially regarding the casting of Brad Pitt and the acting of Orlando Bloom. To be honest, the above is nothing to worry about, both do a more than adequate job. One review on here said the movie would have been spectacular if it was on mute. I didn't know what he/she meant, but I can laugh about it now. (they're right) As the only downsides to this movie is the music and some of the dialogue. Other than that it great entertainment. O'Toole was awesome (like there ever was a doubt) every scene Sean Bean was in boosted the credability of the film. I felt sorry for Eric Bana's character Hector which means he did his job well. Rose Byrne and Brian Cox were the two surprise packets, delivering powerful and believable performances. All of which adds to the theory that if you want a great epic: You can't leave all the acting to the Americans! one needs some Brits or Aussies.(like in.. Gladiator, Braveheart, Lord of the Rings and now Troy.)Don't worry about all the hype, this is a great and inexpensive way to spend an entertaining 3 hours. The scenery and fight sequences are awesome, it's almost worth paying to see how Brad Pitt moves with some of his weapons (shield especially).7/10",,Anonymous,History
Some unforgivable mistakes took the magic away,"Troy could have been a great epic film... if wouldn't have been for some really disrespectful and unnecessary alterations that they did to the immortal story, the great Iliad written by Homer, and considered a masterpiece of literature through thousands and thousands of years... but this guys here just modified it like if all this wouldn't matter...Note: Spoilers coming!Yeah! I am talking about Menelaus killed cowardly by Hector, or Agamemnon killed by Briseis, or Achilles being the cousin of Patroclus, or Hector killing one of the Ayaces, and where is the other Ajax, Diodemes, and all the other Heroes??? If it would not have been for these alterations to the original story, which really disturbed be (if you ever read the Iliad, you'll understand me)and which i really regard as unnecessary, and the usual Hollywood crap added to most American films (a good dose of machismo, exaggeration, historical inaccuracy, etc) This could have been a great film but unfortunately it is not...But this movie is also far away from being a terrible film. The director and the actors did a nice job, Brad Pitt acts very good as usual, The guy that plays Hector does it in an amazing way too, taking most of the sympathy of the public. The movie is exciting and the battles are good, my favorite scene is before Achilles fights Hector, and he repeats the same line that in Homer's book ""There are no pacts between men and lions""!! Another thing that I quiet liked and that was different that the book, is that in the film the GODS don't have much to do with the story, while in the Iliad they are central... but that's not too bad, I didn't miss Zeus or Apollo in the film, and I think this is a smart move for the film, because including the Gods would have been quiet difficult for a film like this.What i missed was the respect for some important aspects of the story, which i mentioned before, and which were removed unscrupulously ... It could have been and immortal epic, but those omissions and alterations are unforgivable, and bring my given note from 10/10 to 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
Best fight scene,"The sequence between Hector and Achilles is the best choreographed fight scene amongst epic fight movies. Cons for Jaime Abregana Jr.The harmony of the deathliest attacks of the heroes, usage of the camera plans with minimum keeps the sequence to watch in breathless.Until the warning of the shocking rise of the back music with the first death injury of Hector, you completely forget to inhale. If you don't care the out of the plan insertions of the castle balcony people (King/father, wife, Helene etc) the whole fight sequence is planned and played very well.The rest of the cast is good enough with a special note for Peter O'Toole and Brian Cox. Their lines are well delivered and their characters are believable.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Fateful struggles,"Have always been fascinated by Greek mythology and the Trojan War, and Homer's 'Iliad' is a major example as to why. Also love and appreciate many film epics, of which there are numerous classics, and they were the main reasons in my interest in seeing 'Troy' (another being that it was the film of choice at the friend/family weekly film night).'Troy' had a lot going for it. A talented cast, it is hard to go wrong with Brian Cox, Sean Bean, James Cosmo, Eric Bana, Brendan Gleeson and Peter O'Toole, a more than capable director in Wolfgang Petersen (though he seemed a curious choice on paper) and a fine composer in James Horner. Will admit to not being completely sure about Brad Pitt, in terms of physicality and whether he had the complexity and presence for a character as complex as Achilles, and Orlando Bloom at first. The reviews for 'Troy' were very mixed and still are, some like and even love it and have been very passionate in their defence and others dislike it intensely and are just as passionate in their criticism. My opinion is somewhere in between, leaning towards moderately liked, there are many strengths that have been mentioned and for me some big weak points, so can see both sides of the debate very clearly.Starting with the positives, 'Troy' looks great. The setting and production look very handsome, evocative and imposing in scale. All beautifully photographed and the editing flows and is at least coherent. Worried that Petersen would struggle with the bigger and bolder approach his directing would need than the claustrophobic approach impressively brought to 'Das Boot', actually he does well in this regard.Particularly in the action sequences, which are exciting and tremendously well staged, showing the passion that was missing in some of the drama. James Horner's score is nowhere near one of his best or most inspired, the rushed composition process does show, but it does have its rousing, beautiful and haunting parts.Most of the cast acquits themselves well. Brad Pitt was better than expected as Achilles, not always comfortable but the charisma and passion is definitely there. Eric Bana excels, providing a noble and sympathetic Hector and have no qualms with Sean Bean who has some of the script's better lines. Brian Cox brings relish and steely intensity, while Brendan Gleeson is a powerful presence in a role that in lesser hands would have been incredibly bland. Likewise with luminous Rose Byrne. James Cosmo is as ever reliable, while Peter O'Toole is perfectly cast, on an emotional level he and Bana are the most believable.Not all the cast fare well, though only two really didn't do much for me. Orlando Bloom is a very characterless Paris, even for a character written as a coward there was nothing interesting about the character and got nothing out of Bloom on a performance level. Diane Kruger has a non-entity role and some of the script's worst lines, and she made the character even blander by bringing absolutely nothing and looking completely lost and even out of place.Would have liked more passion and deeper characterisation, did like that the film didn't try to take sides or make the characters too black and white but the complexity of some of the characters is lost. The romantic elements fare the worst, whereas the action was exciting and passionate the romantic elements were pure soap opera with no chemistry let alone emotion. It is here where Petersen's direction became static.Am not going to go into detail about how many inaccuracies and dumbing down there are in order to be kind to the film, but a lot of the dialogue is more cornball and soapy than thought-provoking or natural. The pace is uneven, there is urgency and purpose when needed but in more intimate moments the film does go dead. Am not going to criticise the film massively for being overlong, there are much longer epics out there on film (many classics), though it did feel at times there wasn't enough content and that the film tended to be too on the surface and not have enough substance so for a two and a half hour film some of it felt on the thin side.Overall, somewhat of a mixed to moderately liked view here where both sides are understandable. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Troy (2004) - Long Live, Achilles!","Loosely based on Homer's 'Iliad', Wolfgang Petersen directs this epic war film, with an ensemble cast including Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, Diane Kruger, Sean Bean, Brian Cox, Rose Byrne, Garrett Hedlund, Peter O' Toole, Brendan Gleeson, & Tyler Mane. Set in 1193 B.C., this movie tells the story of a war between the two cities of Troy and Sparta, and the story of one of the bravest warriors to roam ancient Greece named Achilles. Brad Pitt delivers one of the best performances of his career as Achilles, giving the right amount of power and strength. Eric Bana is also terrific as Prince Hector, trying to negotiate peace between Troy and Sparta. Besides the supporting cast, Peter O' Toole is just perfect playing the king of Troy. The only disappointing character in this movie is Orlando Bloom as Hector's prince brother, who seems to overreact in every scene he is in, as if trying to end the project early, and walk away with his paycheck. Although the movie contains a running time of 162 minutes, director Wolfgang Petersen perfectly makes the audience forget about those 162 minutes, because they'll be distracted by all the incredible action. This movie contains some of the most elaborate action sequences that I've ever seen on film. The costumes and the art direction all stay true to the ancient Greece setting, and they all create a realistic feel to the movie. This movie is perfectly well-made, from the distinguished art, to the intense battle sequences. Yes, the movie is somewhat inaccurate to Homer's Iliad, but at least this movie is flat out entertaining. I haven't seen that much gladiator movies in my time, but I can safely say that ""Troy"" is one of the most remarkable and action-packed motion pictures that audiences will never forget. ""Troy"", in my review, ""action-packed, beautifully well-made"".",8.0,Anonymous,History
Remarkable production value but very flawed,"For a movie loosely based on a poem written thousands of years ago, the director and screenwriter have done an excellent job in re-creating the epic story and the ancient world on the screen, which was probably quite a difficult task. The production is fantastic, visual effects are great, and yet my opinion on Troy is divided in two: The movie is built in such a way that we, the viewers, aren't entirely sure who are the bad guys. Brad Pitt's Achilles is displayed as the star, the hero, and yet he fights for the Greeks, who are displayed as brutal warriors under the rule of a greedy tyrant, Agamemnon. In fact, the entire Trojan War was started only because of the greed of the king of Sparta, Menelaus. Paris, the prince of Troy (son of Priam, the king) took Helen, Menelaus' wife, back to Troy with him after a peace meeting in Sparta. This enraged Menelaus and so Agamemnon, his brother, rounded up the entire Greek army to attack Troy and retrieve his wife. On the other hand, the Trojans are sort of shown as the ""good guys"". Just because of one mistake that Paris made, the Trojans now have to hold back an attack of 50,000 Greeks, while loosing thousands of husbands, sons and cousins in the process. Hector is displayed as a family man: He doesn't want to go to war, he'd rather stay home with his wife and newborn child, but he is loyal to Troy and must fight for her. This is slightly different than the way the Trojan War had always been conveyed to me: Helen did not run off with Paris, but Paris seduced her and practically kidnapped her with him back to Troy. Hector was a big, brutal warrior who had absolutely no problem with killing as many people as he possibly could. I really liked the way the movie showed the Trojans as the good guys and the Greeks as the evil, greedy tyrants. It's definitely a fresh and original approach to the story.Production-wise the movie is stunning. The costumes, the sets, and the weapons everything is top-notch, with excellent attention to details. The visuals are also stunning. The shot of Brad Pitt standing on the deck of a ship with the camera slowly zooming out, eventually revealing the entire Greek navy consisting of 1,000 ships is really a treat to the eye. The computer graphics are excellent. It's really hard to tell in the huge battle scenes which soldiers are computer graphics and which are extras, although you know that some of them must be CG because there are so many. The long shots of the city of Troy are also great eye candy. In all, the one thing this movie is especially excellent at is entertaining, and it is definitely a visually satisfying movie.The acting is also pretty good. Brian Cox definitely stands out as the power-hungry Agamemnon. His acting is top-notch. Peter O'Toole is also good as Priam, the king of Troy. Eric Bana was great as Hector, although I don't think he physically matches the part. Brad Pitt wasn't as bad as I was worried he would be. In fact, his acting was quite good. Which brings me to my second opinion: While Brad Pitt's acting was quite good, I just don't think he fits the character of Achilles. It seems as if Brad Pitt wasn't entirely comfortable with Achilles' character, so he took it and dressed it over his own personality, which changed the character a bit. Physically, though, he looks perfect for the part. Eric Bana, on the other hand, is just the opposite. He truly captured the essence of the Hector character, and his acting is great, but I don't think that he physically matches the part. He's just kind of small and scrawny, while Hector is supposed to be taller and more muscular than Achilles, which is not how it seemed in the movie. It also seemed that his character was a bit too weak. He's supposed to be the greatest fighter on Earth, matched only by Achilles, and yet he struggled a bit just to kill Achilles' cousin, who had never even been in a battle before. When you look at how easily Achilles killed the giant soldier in the very beginning of the movie, it kind of makes Hector look far weaker than he's supposed to be. Also, while Agamemnon was supposed to be power-hungry and greedy, he was not hasty, and was considered to be one of the wisest kings. And yet, in the movie he makes very hasty and stupid decisions, which kind of lower his character to a stupid power-hungry oaf, while he was really quite smart. One character that I'm really happy about is Odysseus, played by Sean Bean. His character's essence was truly and perfectly captured: He's cunning, a good warrior and extremely smart. He constantly gives Achilles advice on how to approach Agamemnon, and is conveyed perfectly as Achilles' close friend. Odysseus also suggests various war strategies to Agamemnon, who is reluctant to listen. Now as much as I dislike Orlando Bloom, he actually pulls off the Paris character quite well, and fits the part of the weak, cowardly, naive pretty-boy prince perfectly.All in all, Troy is definitely an entertaining movie, and the production is remarkable, but a few major historical inaccuracies, strange casting choices and a particularly cliché Hollywood ending lower my appreciation for the film.",6.0,Anonymous,History
What this movie needed was more gladiator style combat n more footage of Ajax.,"Its strange that my earlier review got deleted. Must be some Bollywood fanboy.I first saw this in 2004 in a theatre, then again on a dvd which I own.Revisited the Director's Cut of 196 minutes recently which has more nudity of Diane Kruger (amazing boobs n butt), it has more violence and gore, including much more of Ajax's bloody rampage on the Trojans during the initial attack by the Greek Army.It also has a sequence where the few surviving Trojans escape to Mount Ida.The only thing i didn't like in the Director's Cut was the scene depicting the soldiers raping women and murdering babies.This one is a good example of a sword n sandal movie but there is no tension or suspense.The best scene is the fight sequence between Hector n Achilles along with a superb background music.",7.0,Anonymous,History
So it's not(!) the Iliad...,"But it's an inspiring tale of men(!) at war in ancient times.  The movie, albeit long, moves along a good pace, with mercifully brief romantic and philosophical breaks between the combat scenes.  This movie is action, with more than a little thought put into accurately presenting the realities of the tactics used in Greek warfare.  Troy is also to be congratulated for not over-armoring the cast like previous Hollywood productions and staying true to the lightness of armor prevalent during the historical period.Lovers of Homer and Greek mythology may be disappointed but keep in mind this film is about the Trojan War, not the Iliad.  This war is epic in scale and isn't about poetry.Still, it would be great if Sean Bean were given the opportunity to play Odysseus again.  Although not on screen much in Troy, his performance is edgy and true to the legends of the cunning king of Ithaca.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Major failure. Brad Pitt IS Derek Zoolander in Troy,"Not too much to say about this much-anticipated but seriously disappointing epic. Brad Pitt's performance can go down as one of the worst ever. He actually does a great imitation of Ben Stiller in Zoolander throughout the picture. Who ever thought that this California surfer-dude type with minimal acting talent could actually bring the stoic yet complicated heroism required for the role of the great Greek hero Achilles. Possibly the worst casting ever! Brad's acting is criminal in this movie. The epitome of junk-food lollipop Hollywood cinema. It could just as well as been Britney Spears as Achilles, with same effect. On the flip-side, most other actors are quite good, especially Eric Bana as Hector.The music in this movie is horrendous, sappy, syrupy, and recycled from Jurassic Park and Star Wars. It made me sick to my stomach when this cheesy cookie-cutter music swells during the battle scenes. ugh!The cinematography was also less than par. When everything wasn't CGI and actually human, the footage seems over-exposed. Close the iris 1 f-stop Roger Pratt! What were you thinking? The film had no visual lavishness, no colour-play, no truly great pictures to look at. Let's not even mention the story! Who on earth gave Peterson the right to kill off Agamemnon??!! Homer and Aeschylus are rolling in their graves.The movie might be more than tolerable if it weren't for Brad Pitt.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Typical Hollywood Epic ie Not Historically Accurate But Visually Enticing and Decent Entertainment,"Petersen's 'Troy' boasts of high quality production values. The sets are lavish. The props, especially the costumes and weapons are interesting. The locations and visuals are spectacular. The cinematography is stunning. The special effects look good. The one-on.one combat scenes are well choreographed and visualized. However, the battle scenes look a bit too decorated.Most fans of Hollywood epics would love 'Troy'. I stress on the word Hollywood because for me that is also a major flaw of the film. For the sake of convenience, the film isn't exactly accurate to the source and has the usual Hollywood ending. The characters and parts of the story have been slightly altered. Agamemnon who was known to be a wise thinker appears to be rash and silly here. Hector is known to be extremely strong but here he struggles to fight with Patroclis and appears clumsy and a little frightened when fighting Achilles.The casting of Brad Pitt was definitely intended to pull a larger crowd. Not that Pitt is awful or anything, in fact he does show signs of good acting, but you pretty much see his usual on screen persona rather than him playing Achilles. Eric Bana, though it is questionable whether he fits the part, does a splendid job in the acting department, beating his more famous co-stars Pitt and Bloom. Orlando Bloom is rightfully weak, naive and stubborn as Paris. Brian Cox is brilliantly menacing. Julie Christie has one scene but she shines. Sean Bean is great as Odysseus. Peter O'Toole is excellent as usual. The scene where he displays Priam's despair as he watches Troy fall apart strikes a chord more than any other scene and another scene where he meets Achilles to take back the body of his dead son is incredibly done. This latter scene also has some superb dialogue.The women do not have much to do. Diane Kruger is drop-dead gorgeous as Helen. She fits the part like a jigsaw puzzle and conveys Helen's guilt, ambivalence and love with grace but the character, who plays such a crucial role in history is given too little screen time here and the viewer does not get to see the depth of her thoughts and feelings. Saffron Burrows needs to eat more but her acting is better than her usual. Rose Byrne is alright.'Troy' may not be a cinematic masterpiece but it is visually enticing and overall decent entertainment.",,Anonymous,History
Not bad... but not great.,"TROYThis is an epic film. It is not really my kind of film, but I can understand why it is popular to other people. There were things about this film I loved, but there were also things I was not too keen on.The film is about the battle of Troy. The main character is Achilles played by Brad Pitt. The acting was really good and the film had a brilliant cast list. Starring in this film with Brad is Sean Bean, Julian Glover, Nathan Jones, Peter O'Toole, Eric Bana & Orlando Bloom Everyone does a great job.The story was quite good, but I felt it dragged on for too long. I was hoping it was going to be gripping throughout the movie, but there were times where I was getting a little bored. But just as I was getting bored, another fighting sequence came along.The fighting scenes were absolutely amazing. They were violent, gory and very well shot. I don't know how much of this film was computer effects and how many extras were used, but there were so many people during the fighting scenes that you didn't know where to look. It was action and excitement every time. Sometimes you could see that when the people were stabbing each other, they were missing by miles, but it was not very often and it didn't ruin the scene.My favourite scene in the whole film was when the king played by Peter O'Toole went into the enemy camp to get his sons body back. The conversation he had with Brad Pitt in his hut was very tense. I could sense the respect and tension between both characters, and even though they were only talking it was a very captivating scene and the best scene of the film. Both actors played that scene perfectly.I will give this film 6 out of 10.Good fight scenes and great dialogue, but it was too long and a little boring in places.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",6.0,Anonymous,History
Terrific Troy!,I'm not much of an ancient war movie type of girl. But this really caught my attention. Other than the fact that I saw loads of people die horrendously and having to cover my eyes for a quarter of the film. It truly was really good. The acting was marvellous and the music was amazing. I especially love when the music builds up up to an intense scene. The scenery really captured that essence of history. I would definitely recommend this to any war movie lover.

Still great after 18 years,"LatetotheShow here - just rewatching a few of my favourite movies, and Troy is exceptionally great as a period movie - and it is just exactly what all such movies should be;
beautiful compositions, fantastic cast, excellent dialogue, wonderful costumes, compelling story, well cut & put together, paced perfectly, and limitlessly entertaining.As for those who are such sticklers for 'facts' I don't see how they enjoy any movies. All they seem to do is watch movies like this for the express purpose of daring the production to be wrong in any way so they can rant about inaccuracies.If you want some facts - at least the few you can get regarding this era of ancient history - watch a documentary and read books by archeologists & historians.If you want a fantastically entertaining movie night, watch this.There is so much unknown & so much conjecture about ancient Greece - so who cares how an epic film portrays it? Moreover, a lot of this story is based on pure myth. If it's myth-novel-and fictional - then why can't it be portrayed in any another fictional way?Yet again, a handful of loud people who insist their pure fiction remain unchanged. They don't even like any altered version of children's fairy tales.*sigh*

solid entertainment,This movie is quite long but very intense the whole way through. It has a good story line fair acting and some amazing production values. This movie has some of the best battle scenes I have ever seen in a movie like this and I have seen a lot.This movie is about a young prince of troy (Orlando Bloom) who destroys his fathers peace treaty with Sparta when he steals the kings wife away from him. The angry king gets all the men of Greece and launches the largest army ever seen at the time. !000 ships 50000 men all to the beaches of troy. The trogans get ready and prepare to defend their home.This movie is great. Brad pitt did a great job and so did everybody else except Eric bana.

*Brad Pitt Made This Movie*,"Brad Pitt portraying Achilles,was absolutely spot on to me.I never had much regard for Achilles in Greek Mythology,until I seen this movie.I am a fan of all Brad Pitt's films,but this one really made me think,""man he can do it all"".He is what I inspire to be in the movie world,and that is a lifelike character in any role he takes.I never see him as an actor,I see him as that character,what ever it may be,he brings it to life,is real,and doesn't seem to just be a pretty face reading lines.For all the haters of him,I will say this,name actors that feel ""real"" in their role,such as Samuel L. Jackson,John Travolta,Denzel Washington,and you will quickly find that Pitt fits the same mold.Some people are meant to act,and do it with no problem,and that is how Pitt feels as Achilles in this film.Now Don't get me wrong though,this movie is more than just about Pitt as Achilles,there is great acting throughout,great cinematography,and the story is raw and as close to the myth as possible,without leaving out the hardcore,raw,fighting that would almost surely be present in those times.Great Film and I promise after seeing Pitt as Achilles,you will have a new image of the Great Achilles!

Did Homer really write this?,"I remember a time in eighth grade when Eddie F. challenged me to a fight. I was class monitor, charged with upholding the values of decency and honor. (My main job was to keep kids in their seats when teacher was out.)  Eddie F. was the leader of kids who wanted out of their seats.  Anyways, about 25 people gathered around in a littered alley as Eddie F. beat me to a pulp because he received too many demerits. I guess that's the same scenario in ""Troy"", when in the middle of a pitched battle, 100,000 sweating, bloodied and ferocious warriors ceased stabbing each other to watch Hector and Patroclus(thought to be Achilles)fight to the finish. Sound reasonable?In another scene, Achilles comforts the beautiful cousin of Hector, who is now a captured ""guest"" of Achilles, and who has just been beaten and tossed about by sweaty, hell-bent Greek soldiers.  ""Are you hurt?"" he asks while attempting to wipe her blood-covered face.  Another example of inane dialog is when Helen of Sparta/Troy says to Trojan prince Paris, her illicit suitor of the past two nights:  ""That was a mistake.""I think Homer must be summoning the gods for a sign that this was really the Iliad that he envisioned.However, I sheepishly must admit that I was entertained nevertheless. Brad Pitt looked good, leaped handsomely around the set during fight scenes, and gave the suggestion that the film should have been called ""Achilles"" instead of ""Troy.""   The computer-generated armies looked convincing, and the acting was at least better than average. 7* out of 10*.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Helen Had Nothing To Do With It,"Went to see the movie ""Troy"" this afternoon. Here's what I learned:Contrary to popular opinion and history in general, Greek men were not gay. EVER. This was clearly established immediately at the start of the film and reinforced every five minutes or so thereafter. So it is safe for American dudes to see this movie.Helen of Troy always had impeccable hair and makeup. She looked gorgeous in all of her brief cameo scenes which, though numerous, were probably all filmed on the same day, one after the other, with the director saying, ""Alright, now look beautiful . . . good ... OK, now look frightened ... good... now look depressed ... good ... now look interested . . . good ... now look beautiful again ... good...""Most Greek and Trojan men had British accents. Those with American accents couldn't act.Trojans looked just like Greeks, but they tended to stay on the right side of the screen.Brad Pitt does not blink on camera.Helen of Troy's biggest line was, ""They're coming for me.""Trojan music sounded remarkably like modern Bulgarian music.Brad Pitt's thighs go all the way up.Achilles had a young male friend with whom he was very close, but it's OK. They were cousins. Never mind what history says.Peter O'Toole can tell an entire story with just an expression.Trojan gods apparently all had Greek names, but their statues either looked Egyptian or like Peter O'Toole in drag.Greek men never touched each other unless they were fighting, much like American men.All of the thousands of extras in the movie had exactly the same skin color... Light Egyptian, by Max Factor.Troy had only three women.There were lots of blond Greeks, which is good news for Brad Pitt, who would otherwise have really stuck out.Despite their coastal desert locale, Greeks had the uncanny ability to find unlimited amounts of timber to build fires, funeral pyres, Trojan horses and the like.British actors look silly with Greek hairdos.Brad Pitt changes expression only when the sun is shining directly in his eyes.Greek soldiers fought constantly, but their outfits always looked impeccable.Greek soldiers wore underwear under their skirts.Apparently Greek temples were always in ruins, even back when they were all new.",1.0,Anonymous,History

Re-watching it recently i rediscovered just how great this movie is looking and well paced it is. At running time 2 h 35 min this almost movie never drags and is terrifically looking entertainment from start till finish. Actors did terrific job - they all are great in this one (just except for maybe Orlando) . I always liked that there is not clear hero / villain in this one and you can root for both sides : Brad Pitt and Eric Bana were truly superb in their respective roles and especially Bana who is the star of this movie i think. Sets were gorgeous and its feel of place and time is superbly made. The only flaw i think was a third act that it felt a bit draggy, but still there is a lot be loved there.Overall, ""Troy"" (2004) still hold up as a terrific popcorn entertainment.

Average movie but bad adaptation,"I can recall having seen this movie when it first came out in cinemas. While I can understand that adaptations need to thin out the source material and change a few things, I really didn't like the changes made in this movie. I mean, the director(s) changed who lived and who died and once more in a movie about Troy, the greek hero Diomedes isn't even mentioned.
However, I don't want to base my review on the changes made by the director since I can kind-of understand. The actors are doing a pretty good job in their respective roles, the movie looks quite nice and the fights are gory and entertaining.Should you see it?

There is also tremendous support from Eric Bana, Peter O'Toole and Sean Bean. Strongest of recommendations.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Wolfgang Petersen...go home please!!!!,"Hello there,This is my first post in IMDb even though I use it as a reference for quite a while. I would therefore like to salute you all. The fact that I am a Greek is inevitably going to affect my judgement I hope not to your annoyance.I spent 2 years of my life, (all we Greeks did actually), analysing Omirus epos (and not Homers as you see everywhere), rhyme by rhyme. If I recall well it was Iliada (Iliad) on 8th grade and Odysseia (Odyssey) on 9th grade. Warner's Troy, was a big disappointment to me and my fellow Greeks around the campus (I study in the UK).Iliad epos is one of the very best literature works ever made. It was composed by a Greek poet Omirus a whole 400 years after the actual war. Historians put Trojan war around 1200 BC, and the actual reason of the war not being Helen's beauty but the strategically crucial position of Troy. That said one may now understand that Omirus epos is not presenting the actual events (as it's not accurate historically) but this was never the purpose of this work.Reading this huge poem, one can find himself wondering for the very definitions of honour, love, anger, hate, heroism, discipline, loyalty and so on. The best part and the most educational as well were these prolonged talks between the warriors before the battle. None of these though were revealed in 'Troy'Warner's Troy was really cheap to my eyes, and to other intellectual people English Finnish and German colleagues of me as well. It is a shame to spend millions of dollars in such a bad scenario. By the way perfect storm was a bad and stupid blockbuster (computers graphics did the whole work), and yet it is Wolfgang Petersen's best work.I conclude saying that you'd better watch something else instead. I would give Troy 2 out of 10. It is a really expensive B movie.CheersAlex",2.0,Anonymous,History

Could have been great,"Troy was well paced, well edited, well written, well directed and for the most part, well acted. What went wrong? The soundtrack and Brad Pitt.Mr. Pitt does not act, but rather poses his way through this lengthy adaptation of The Iliad, like some cross between a rock star and the vainglorious Achilles. Is this posing,superficiality and transparency supposed to symbolize Achilles' vanity and egotism? How then, do we explain his interest in Perseus, and his ability to inspire warriors in battle more profoundly than the greatest Greek kings? Pitt indulges a grand total of two facial expressions - disinterest and mild annoyance - throughout the entire recounting of Homer's epic detailing the Trojan war. The rest of the actors are quite excellent, making Pitt's flashy performance stand-out like a sore thumb.Although this is probably a personal peeve, the soundtrack for this film really aggravated me. The score consisted of pseudo-classical meanderings-about a redundant theme - with tempos all too perfectly suited for the various battle scenes etc. My guess is that the music was supposed to heighten the excitement of these scenes. Unfortunately, for me, it only distracted me from them.All considered, I enjoyed Troy. I think it could have been a much much better film, however, had Brad Pitt been encouraged to use more of his talent and less of his abs and pecs. The film easily would have achieved a rating of 8 or 9 from me had Achilles role been more competently handled - even with the tedious soundtrack.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Gods envy men's mortality: myth is mutable,"Far better than I expected from its reputation and the critics. This is as lavish and enjoyable an old-fashioned film epic as I have seen, and much better than most. Epic is not an easy genre in which to satisfy the nit-pickers: it paints a story with broad strokes, and it's not difficult to find fault with smaller details. Things worth noting: the contrasting balance between the two sides seemed particularly well done. The Trojans were vaguely Asian or near-Eastern, and the Greeks were vaguely Germanic or Western. At the same time the armour and equipment of both were equally impressive, and more or less of an age. The Trojans were softer, more civilized and tender; the Greeks were rougher and tougher and more barbaric, but more effective --- and cunning. A civilized man is a city-dweller. The Trojans were citizens, the Greeks were rustics. In the end the cunning peasants won.The settings and fight scenes were terrific. Much of the acting was excellent, and Brad Pitt, especially, was extremely powerful. He comes over as a kind of cross between Schwarzenegger and Crowe; just a slight touch of the Neanderthal without seeming stupid. In fact, while watching, I kept thinking how real his Achilles was --- whether or not the man ever existed, three thousand years ago. Hector, who is presented as the honourable, civilized man, could have been a bit more rugged, in order to give greater stature to Achilles' opposition. The homo-erotic relationship between Patroclus and Achilles is glossed over, and does not convince. Patroclus doesn't look good enough, and calling him ""cousin"" fails to explain why Achilles gets so worked up about his death. I agree with those critics who felt there was insufficent physical chemistry between the protagonists, and some of the dialogue was a little clunky. There wasn't quite enough life in the passions between Paris and Helen, Hector and Andromache, Priam and his sons. On the other hand the Iliad itself is not about love, but centres on Achilles; his grimly fatalistic attitude, and his acceptance of a short, spectacular life instead of unmemorable longevity. This was very well presented, and strongly reminiscent of the Old Norse belief that the only thing that doesn't die is a famous name.The presence of the Gods was finely suggested: these ancient humans are in the grip of forces beyond their control. They are doomed by fate to act out their given roles: which the Gods have decided for them. Freedom and choice was illusory. It still is. As for ""accuracy"", as several viewers have pointed out, this is quite irrelevant, especially as the film never sets out to represent Homer's Iliad, line for line.Watching this adaptation for the second time, it is sinking in what a new, deeply interesting and creative take the writer has made on the prehistoric legends. Bad films often seem good, first time round, but repeated viewings reveal them to be shallow. Good films get better the more you watch. As time goes on, this re-interpretation will surely mature and improve, until its worth is recognized.Some reviewers have criticized the performances of Paris and Helen. I don't get it. The actress is beautiful, and that is all she has to be. She is merely the face that launched the thousand ships: the excuse for the war, not the real reason. Paris is a feckless playboy, a lover not a fighter, but a good archer.This film is stuffed with mind-expanding ideas, superb performances, spectacular action and scenery. The computer graphics are inevitable, these days, but they do conjure up powerful images. This is certainly one of the very best epics I have seen; and I'm astonished by the number of negative reviews.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Flawed in many ways but yet perfectly entertaining to watch.,"""Troy"" is a movie that will not live long on in the memory. There are several problems with the movie but yet it serves its purpose well; to bring some popcorn-entertainment.First problem I had with the movie was the story. This version of the famous the Iliad is extremely Hollywood-ized, including a typical Hollywood like love-story. The 'villains' are also stereotypical, which brings me to another problem, who was actually supposed to be the main hero and villain? Brad Pitt's character Achilles is way too arrogant to sympathies for and Eric Bana's role is too small and uninteresting to regard him as the big hero. The story never picks sides, so with as a result that the movie is almost like a documentary like observation. Only problem is that it is not very good documentary material. They simply took too many liberties with the story for my taste.But seriously, this doesn't take away that this movie is entertaining to watch. OK the movie is not really epic in terms of the battles or story but the man-against-man fights are well choreographed and spectacular to watch. Most certainly the highlights of the movie.The movie is filled with some big names in both small and large roles. Brian Cox is unfortunately a bit overacting at times and Diane Kruger is not perfect enough to play Helen. Helen is supposed to be the most beautiful woman to have ever lived, I agree with Wolgang Petersen on this one, the Helen character should have never been showed in the movie, no actress can meet the expectation of all the people in the audience in terms of beauty. Best actor of the movie for me was Peter O'Toole. It was nice to see him in a big production again and the same goes for Julian Glover.But why oh why did they ever rejected Gabriel Yared's musical score? James Horner's score is mostly unfitting at times and once again sounds too much like most of his other work.The movie is simply at times a too much of an epic-wannabee. It never succeeds in creating an epic feeling, or any really memorable sequences. I think we can conclude that Wolfgang Petersen was simply not the right man to direct this movie. Still it's way too harsh to call the movie a disappointment or failure.Expect to be entertained and maybe impressed at times but don't expect to be blown away by it.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Stunning production of the movie, Brad Pitt and acting beyond imagination","I loved this movie so much, It may be one of the best movies to ever exist in terms of acting. Brad Pitt, Eric Banna, Bryan Cox, Vincent Reegan and Brendan Gleeson literally played the roles of their life in this movie. The sword fights and 1v1 fights in general are pure art in this movie. The first time I celebrated about something in a movie ever is in (HUGE SPOILER ALERT) Hector's death. The only reason I won't rate this movie a 10/10 is due to the (kind of) silly ending. Where the producers and script writers really seemed like they rush to kill people and put an end to the movie as quickly as possible without giving enough time before it for these thing to happen. Although that may be a more realistic kind of way for things to end I find that the only flaw of the movie.

The reason we tell these tales over and over again is no accident...,"This movie was absolutely perfect. Brad Pitt has arrived as a great actor; and matches the legendary Peter O'Toole (who plays King Priam) as he creates an organic, believable 'Achilles'. The fact that Wolfgang Petersen overlooks the orthodoxy of Homer and amalgamates Virgil's Aenied ( including the Trojan horse) is of no matter to me. Nor does it matter, the absence of the mysticism of Greek mythos. The relevance of the Greek Gods has been suppressed in this film. The terse dialogue still respects the ancient characters and concepts. Ed Bana is just as I would imagine 'Hektor' would be like. Brian Cox plays 'Agamemnon' as he could possible be in reality: selfish, ambitious and yet somehow heroic. 'Odysseus' perfectly balanced humanity is well preserved from the Homeric prose (brilliantly and humbly played by British stage veteran, Sean Bean) Indeed, the personalities of the characters and how they contrast are what make the Iliad the ultimate tale of human morality.The screenplay by David Benioff is well adjusted to modern times w/o sacrificing the mores of that time. The only other period-film that succeeded in both being ""Hollywood"" and actually convincing, time-wise, was Tombstone (directed by George P. Cosmatos, 1993). Troy highlights the vanities that we no longer analyze within ourselves. Pride and Greed are now interwoven into our culture. That was probably the true motivation that inspired Homer in his day  which was a time very similar to our own. The luxury of ancient Greece and Troy easily matched our opulence and privileges. The bourgeois trappings of a comfortable society rend the same beasts: sheep, wolves and lions.The reason we tell these tales over and over again is no accident.

For instance, did a goddess actually save Paris from being killed during his duel with Helen's husband or is the grain of truth in the episode that Paris somehow survived in a less than noble manner? Similarly, was Achilles' mother a goddess who dipped her son's body in the River Styx making him invulnerable in battle or is the grain of truth here - as some historians have suggested - that he had some of the first iron armor which could not be penetrated by the bronze weapons of his opponents.As Homer did Troy focuses on the relationship between Achilles and Agamemnon and not the love story between Paris and Helen. If her face launched 1,000 ships it was because she was the pretext, not because she was the reason.What Troy accomplishes is a very well done depiction of the human egos, ambitions, flaws, anger, and tragedy that lie beneath Homer's poetry. The acting is excellent, the costuming beautiful, the special effects are flawless, and the battle sequences are wonderfully choreographed. If you aren't interested in any of that then you can just relax and enjoy watching Brad Pitt, Orlando Bloom, and the rest of the cast.Hundreds of years later Troy was still remembered in Homer's time because it was a clash between two great civilizations which went to war and destroyed themselves.",,Anonymous,History
"A few pluses, a lot of minuses","Do blue-eyed flaxen-haired bronzed Brad Pritt and Diane Kruger really resemble Greeks, ancient or otherwise?  Can you really thrust a sword or a spear through pieces of armor plate, front and back?  Did Troy really look like this place?  You could go on, and in fairness there are a lot of questions about the historical basis of the Iliad on which this is very loosely based. How possible would it have been in Greece, for example, with its denuded hillsides (munched by goats) to find enough wood to build 1000 ships?  But back to the film. I agree with those who say Brad Pitt was the wrong person to cast as Achilles, while Peter O'Toole puts in a good performance but which in no way compensates. I also had misgivings about Orlando Bloom. Most of the other actors are adequate, nothing more.  The realism of the battle scenes varies a lot, sometimes good, sometimes ridiculous.  Ditto for the accompanying sound effects.  At times the film manages to resurrect fleetingly the feel of historical epics of the past (""Ben Hur"", ""Cleopatra"" etc), and that is one of the pluses.  Another plus is that some people might be inspired to investigate the classics and/or ancient Greek history.   But overall there are just too many faults and too much lacking.  5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"""Troy"" is a thrilling ride, one of the year's best and most underrated action movies.","""Troy"" (2004) Dir. Wolfgang Petersen I, like so many others, was expecting A LOT out of ""Troy"" when I headed along to opening night and sat in the dark cinema, watching the action unfold. Initially, I didn't think as much of the movie as I now do. I gave it a 7/10 on first viewing, but I knew I had to see it again, it is just one of those films that demands multiple viewings.So I saw it again for History class (since it's not historically accurate, perhaps that wasn't the best idea). And I bought the DVD.And look what happened.I strongly suggest to anyone who was looking forward to ""Troy"" in cinemas to rent or buy the DVD and give it another chance in your home. It is truly a much richer, perhaps even exciting experience, as your expectations have been lowered, and often this makes a movie-watching experience better.Anyone who is not tired of the two-huge-armies-face-off battles we've been seeing in ""The Lord of the Rings"" films and now many other films following in that trilogy's footsteps will sure love the battles in ""Troy"". ""Troy"" takes it's battle sequences very seriously and while they have an epic grandeur look about them, at the heart of the battle - men are dying, men are killing other men. It's not all about kicking ass in this film. The battle sequences are a little more graphic than you might expect, and they are certainly brutal.Brad Pitt, looking absolutely incredible here (the months of training sure paid off), shoulders the movie with much confidence and adds layers to his arrogant, self-centred Achilles. It's refreshing that Pitt, though technically the central hero of the piece, plays the character in a less likable way than you might expect. Achilles is unpredictable and dangerous, he was ""born to end lives"". As the greatest warrior in history, he is most definitely convincing.Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom play more emotional heroes, and while Bana manages to give Hector an awesome kick-ass edge, strong nobility and adds many dimensions to his heroic part, Bloom doesn't quite handle the job as well. I do not dismiss Bloom's part in the film to be the ""pussy"" as so many have put it, but in emotional scenes, Bloom simply falls flat. His lines (""I'll hunt deer and rabbit, we can live off the land!"") are often laughable due to bad delivery. It is more likely Bloom was put in this part for his looks rather than his talent, which is still in question by yours truly. I did like, though, that Bloom had a more realistic touch, the scene in which he faces Menelaus and fails to defeat him, running back to his brother, is nerve-wracking and powerful, not all men were great butt-kicking heroes, even back then, so it's good to see that put into the film, even if he does play the more ""pussy"" role.One of my main complaints about the film the first time around was the unnecessary relationship between Briseis and Achilles. With more viewings, I have come to appreciate this subplot a lot more. As Achilles puts it, she gave him peace in a time of violence and war. Achilles is a character so often covered in other men's blood, constantly killing and fighting, that Briseis allows for Pitt to show the more sensitive side is actually useful to the character's development. Their final scene together is very emotional and the actors have genuine chemistry.Wolfgang Petersen was criticised for being too much of a claustrophobic director to take on one of the biggest films ever made, but he handles the epic, large scale of the film nicely, if perhaps maybe not using as many swooping, stunning shots as he could. I certainly would've liked to have seen more of the set of Troy exposed. In the inevitable fire-fuelled finale it is showcased brilliantly, but more of these kinds of sequences would've been useful for Petersen to shut his critics up. He does a good job with the film, rooting the battles in genuine emotion and intelligence, and giving it a distinctive, memorable atmosphere and artistic look.Perhaps as a historical piece, ""Troy"" isn't the film you're looking for. But for sheer entertainment value, it is one of the best films of 2004. Again, I urge anyone who was disappointed by the film to rent/buy it on DVD and give it another spin, it's not a decision you'll regret, I know I didn't.9/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
"The ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" of sword and sandal films?","When I first saw the trailer for ""Troy"" and heard that Brad Pitt was playing Achilles, I thought to myself ""This is going to end up being like 'Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves', a film that looks great and has some good actors but it's all offset by a crucial casting error - Brad Pitt as Achilles."" To my surprise, I actually enjoyed ""Troy"" but I still couldn't get my head around the casting of Brad Pitt as Achilles, except that director Wolfgang Petersen admired Pitt's work in ""Fight Club"" and used ""Troy"" as an excuse to work with him. Had this film been made 15 years ago, Brad Pitt probably would have played Paris of Troy.Let me get something straight first though: I don't hate Brad Pitt. I'm not a fan of Brad Pitt but I don't hate him either. I understand that women think Brad Pitt is sex on legs and that has been the big factor in his success, but he's also worked hard over the years to prove that he's more than just a pretty face with odd-ball characterizations including ""Snatch"" and ""Fight Club"". While I commend Pitt for his efforts, I must also acknowledge that being able to play psychopaths doesn't automatically qualify him to play a mythological character, least of all Achilles. I always pictured Achilles as a man who looks like a force of nature, rough and rugged. Pitt clearly hit the weight room, but even at age 40 his face is still too boyish and pretty to really compliment his character. Pitt's performance isn't terrible but it's a mixed bag at best; Pitt gives his all most of the time, but some scenes he's just not trying, like when he refuses to fight the second day of the war after King Agamemnon (Brian Cox) takes Briseis (Rose Byrne) from him. Brad Pitt drives a chariot as though he were Charlton Heston in ""Ben-Hur"", but Pitt is no Charlton Heston.Well, in this loose adaptation of Homer's ""The Iliad"", the aforementioned Agamemnon of Mycenae has gotten pretty much everyone in Greece to join him, with the foreign country Troy being the only rival left. His little brother, however, King Meneleaus of Sparta (Brendan Gleeson) is tired of battle and wants peace with Troy, which he thinks he's established with Princes Hector (Eric Bana) and Paris (Orlando Bloom). What Meneleaus doesn't know is that Paris has been having a week long fling with his wife Helen (Diane Kruger). Paris, being as stupid as he is, smuggles Helen back to Troy to be his wife, which pisses off Meneleaus and prompts the Trojan War, led by Meneleaus and Agamemnon. In addition to King Odysseus of Ithica, AKA: Ulysses (Sean Bean), Achilles is also joining the fray, even though he and Agamemnon don't like each other. Agamemnon hates Achilles because he's kind of a jerk who fights only for himself and Achilles hates Agamemnon because he thinks the king is a power mad coward who won't fight his own battles (in other words, he has no honor as Achilles would define it). Achilles joins the fray only for the glory of his own name and as a favor to his pal Odysseus, the only man he'll listen to. Achilles wins Agamemnon the beach on their first day, but he gets mad when Agamemnon seizes his girl, the spunky Briseis for no apparent reason except that he's a dirty old man and perhaps to annoy Achilles (in ""The Iliad"", it was compensation).Helen thinks of giving herself back to the Spartans in order to protect Paris and Troy, but she is denied that.The lovable family man warrior Hector doesn't want a war and begs his dad King Priam of Troy (Peter O'Toole) to give Helen back to the Greeks, but Priam believes that they can win because of their walls and the fact that they've got Apollo God of the Sun on their side. Hell Hector's first impulse was to sail back to Sparta and give Helen back and beg Meneleaus for forgiveness and then take Paris home and beat some sense into him, but Paris stubbornly refused to let her go unless he went with her and he didn't want his little idiot brother to get killed. Paris tries take responsibility for his actions by challenging Meneleaus to a duel, but despite being younger and quicker Paris is no match for Meneleaus and just as he is about to be killed he turns and scampers away, shaming himself and the family. A further enraged Meneleaus tries to kill Paris but Hector, on familial reflex, whips out his sword and stabs Meneleaus. That pisses off Agamemnon and a big battle is waged without Achilles and his forces, and Hector and the Trojans beat the Greeks back and even kill the power-house Ajax (Tyler Mane) in the process.Paris is ashamed of himself for being a hypocrite and a coward and shaming the family, and despite Helen's attempts to console him, he resolves that he must reclaim at least some of his dignity and pride by getting in touch with his inner elf (sorry, couldn't resist) and starts boning up on his archery. Achilles eventually gets Briseis back in return for his services and steps in just as she's about to be gang raped by some Greeks. Well, Achilles infatuation with Briseis has softened him up and he decides to take his men back home, which annoys his cousin Patroclus (originally just a friend and ally), who feels like they're turning their back on their countrymen.Given Achilles refusal to fight Agamemnon, Patroclus takes it upon himself to fight in Achilles place and leads their men into battle, wearing Achilles armor, as the cavalry against the advancing Trojans, but he is killed by Hector. No one is exactly happy about this except Agamemnon, who counts on using Achilles rage to get rid of one of their biggest obstacles: Hector. Predictably, Achilles goes after Hector, thirsting for revenge despite Briseis begging him not to fight Hector because he's her cousin and the two men fight each other before Troy. Hector fights valiantly but in the end he is killed by Achilles and then dragged away tied to Achilles chariot. Priam later comes before Achilles and begs for his son's body and Achilles eventually agrees, promising him 12 days of peace as well as returning Briseis and complimenting Priam - ""You're a far better king than the one leading this war."" Agamemnon is annoyed with the peace but Odysseus uses it as the chance to plan - by building the Trojan horse that they will hide in and offer up as a kind of gift of surrender to Troy. Achilles tells his first officer to take the men home while he fights a personal battle.The Trojan Horse is built and left for the Trojans to find. Paris has a bad feeling and suggests burning it, but Priam is convinced by his Irish priest (Nigel Terry, King Arthur in ""Excalibur"") to take the thing home. After the celebration, Odysseus and his men open the gates and the Greeks attack, while Achilles searches the city for Briseis. Priam is stabbed in the back by Agamemnon, and Agamemnon is killed by Briseis. Paris gives the sword of Troy to Aeneas and tells him to lead the others out, including Helen, while he searches for his father and happens upon Achilles as he is about to take Briseis and shoots him down with his arrows, thus avenging Hector. Paris and Briseis disappear into the night but we do not know if they escape or not. The film ends with Achilles being burned and Odysseus being philosophical.Like ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" the film is epically mounted and features some great actors, but Brad Pitt kind of offsets things (though he's not as bad as Achilles as Kevin Costner was as Robin Hood). The film works hard at first to keep from having a specific villain, but Brian Cox's campy Agamemnon comes very close to being ""the bad guy"". The best of the lot is Eric Bana as the heroic everyman Prince Hector (though he might have made a better Achilles than Brad Pitt) and Peter O'Toole as King Priam, who has one of the film's most touching scenes: begging for his son's corpse. Let's face it, to the world, Orlando Bloom will ALWAYS be Legalos, and he certainly is so when he picks up the bow and arrow for the climax, but his performance is passable, as there are hints of an actor trying to escape his boyish appearance. He doesn't look quite angry enough when he watches Hector die, but he sounds pretty mad when people dance around the Trojan Horse (""Look at them... you'd think their prince had never died."") Diane Kruger is a decent Helen and she and Bloom work hard to make their characters sympathetic despite their actions. Sean Bean is good but under-used as Odysseus, as is Brendan Gleeson as Meneleaus. Saffron Burrows makes the most of her role as Hector's wife, as does Rose Byrne as Briseis.Some good music by James Horner (who scored the Star Trek films) and well mounted battle scenes similar to if not on par with ""Lord of the Rings"".",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Good film for war/history fans, flawed, but worth every penny","Troy is an excellent movie. For any war/history buff there is enough here to feed upon to overlook any flaws.First, in response to all the Gladiator lovers who said on the boards that there is no one to cheer for in Troy, I say they are idiots. Gladiator was about a single protagonist. Homer's Iliad was always a complicated, ensemble story. The audience has to deal with a lot of main characters and THIS IS A GOOD THING. Its the Iliad, not Batman.There was a complaint about the film not having a good side to relate to. This one irritates me. Real life seldom has the simplistic good guy vs. bad guy dichotomy. This in my mind makes Troy that much more believable. When events unfold I actually believed they could happen. Japanese cinema is so good at times precisely because we don't know who the good guy is. The question is simply irrelevant.The script was written with a mind to keep the important details of the original story intact but to make it as realistic as possible. The gods are there but only in spirit. They don't get directly involved in the action like the original. I think this is a good thing as well. Troy looks like historical recreation rather than a literal translation of the poem. In one scene I thought there was an unlikely event and researched only to find it actually is in the Iliad. When the writer was asking for too much, he was in fact being true to the text. My bad.OK, visually this film is amazing. Not just the army special effects but the sets and scenery are all beautiful. The costuming is first rate and feels very authentic. Remember, we are going back 3200 years. Quite an accomplishment.The violence is likewise beautiful. Blood and guts galore, but interestingly it is both on the battlefield AND in single combat. A fight fan will appreciate the attention to detail in the combatants' moves. I had never seen a shield wielded so realistically on film. Spear and sword are given very realistic treatments as well.Brad Pitt is a good actor. No question about that. Here he has a few moments where he seems out of place, a pretty boy in a soldier's world. But the combat scenes with him are more than enough to make up for that. It has already been discussed how much bigger he is than in Fight Club. The womens will have plenty to look at. His character is complicated and this is also true to the Iliad. Brad Pitt does this internal conflict lots of justice. His actions in the film really seem appropriate. I never asked, like I do in other films, ""Why did he do that?"" But this is not Brad Pitt's film. It's Eric Bana's.Eric Bana was amazing. If Achilles was complex, then Bana's Hector is even more so. I had only seen Bana in Black Hawk Down and The Hulk and while BHD was good, there wasn't much for his character to do but be a soldier. The Hulk was so bad I wrote him off completely, blaming his acting for not saving a horrible script. But here in Troy I have new-found respect. He is the main character in the film if you judge by acting power. Lots of emotional struggling going on here that Bana takes on like a pro. He will join this generation's acting elite if he finds more roles like this.The rest of the cast is good enough with a special note for Peter O'Toole and Brian Cox. Their lines are well delivered and their characters are believable.The writing is good as far as plot development goes but I would take a few points away for some of the modern vocabulary. ""Stop playing with me,"" the pretty Helen tells Paris. ""Playing"" should have been ""joking"" in that scene since I associate playing with modern English and even worse, with modern hip hop English. I shouldn't be getting that feeling in an ancient epic.A+",10.0,Anonymous,History
A great epic with a confused script.,"This film is an adaptation of Greek myths and legends surrounding the war between Greeks and Trojans. According to legend, Troy was besieged for ten years and only fell when the Greeks deceived them with a wooden horse. The film also tells the mith of Achilles. Directed by Wolfgang Petersen, this epic film has screenplay by David Beniof based on Homer's Iliad, and a good cast with the participation of Brad Pitt (as Achilles), Eric Bana (as Hector), Orlando Bloom (as Paris), Diane Kruger ( as Helen), Brian Cox (as Agamemnon, the Greek king), Brendan Gleeson (as Menelaus, the Spartan king) and Peter O'Toole (as Priam, the Trojan king).This type of epics, whether mythological or biblical, has an important feature: the whole script, scenery and costumes must be carefully written and planned because the audience knows the story beforehand and is waiting for something consistent with what she know. And this film managed to comply with this feature, although its too far from Homer at various moments. Visually, the film is excellent, with great costumes, scenery, photography, sound and visual effects. Some of the performances also surprised by the depth and drama, like Peter O'Toole in the role of Priam. Brad Pitt also performed very well, although his character doesn't leave room for him to show all his talent.The big problem of this movie is the script, which tries to mix various Greek myths with the story of Homer's Iliad, ending up lost and confused by too much information. Consequently, there are characters in the film that have great relevance but hardly appear in the myth (Briseis and Patroclus for example), whereas other characters that mythology values ​​will end up virtually disappeared in the film (Cassandra and Ulysses are obvious examples). Another ""victim"" of this poorly thought out script was Achilles, a central character in the film, beautifully played by Pitt but a shadow of mythological Achilles, which has a much greater depth and psychological wealth, something that the script didn't know or didn't want to explore. I'm sure that Brad Pitt would have been up to the challenge if writer had followed that path. Unfortunately, he chose to value other things, almost creating sub-plots that then kills at birth by not giving them continuity. There are also characters and situations that arise and only those who know the Greek mythology understand why, because the film doesn't give them any explanation or follow-up. For example, the sudden and momentary appearance of Aeneas at the end of the movie... only who knows the mythology will know that Aeneas is one of the names associated with the founding of Rome.This movie is a good movie, with good actors and a good story. It would be an even better movie if script was better but, nevertheless, worth seeing it.",6.0,Anonymous,History

I know it's nowhere near accurate to the book. Because trust me I do love the book and definitely prefer the story of it to this movie. But it's not as bad as most people think. I mean, if you think this is bad, go watch Clash Of The Titans (2010). This movie could have been way worse. But it's fun and I enjoy seeing the characters go from page to the screen. I also really enjoy the fact that like the book they manage to make both sides relatable and you have characters to root for in bothe the Trojan and Greek Armies.

""Kalifornia"" ""12 Monkeys"" ""Fight Club"" ""Snatch"" His self deprecating humor makes him human, almost accessible. Fortunately ""Troy"" will soon be forgotten. Only still photographs with Pitt, semi naked in ravishing sprint positions will decorate the walls of legions of salivating fans. Strange, ""Das Boot"" is one of the great films of the second part of the 20th Century. What is Wolfgang Petersen doing directing this?

"Epic, For Better And Worse","Everything about Troy smacks of 'Hollywood epic,' from the lingering establishing shots to the score to the stilted dialogue to the bloated runtime to the vaguely British accents of the cast. The work that went into the sets and costumes is indeed impressive and there a couple of excellent, albeit relatively brief, action scenes - especially the centerpiece duel between Hector and Achilles. The movie's biggest flaw is its core premise: it condenses the siege of Troy from 10 years to about a week, and it tries to directly adapt The Iliad (and parts of The Odyssey) but it omits the gods and goddesses. As such the characters' motives and actions don't always make sense. In The Iliad, for example, the warring armies are separated in the midst of battle and forced to retire for the day because Zeus intervenes; in Troy they just kind of decide to stop fighting and take the afternoon off because ... too many people are dying, but they'll come back tomorrow and try to massacre each other then?",6.0,Anonymous,History

Clean fun with flaws,"Ok, this story had to be adapted. It was far too epic and super-sized to remain in Homer's pages. To do it, of course they would have to get all the best money can buy, and the results when you see it are as expected: massive sequences, massive sets, amazing sights, amazing visions. But ""Troy"" falls a bit flat specially because of the way the source material had to be juggled in order to adapt itself for a two-and-a-half-hour movie. So, apparently, the gods are dropped in favor of a much more militaristic, ""gladiatoresque"" approach - in the original tale, men fought alongside the gods, which were pivotal to the battle events. Here, men fight for honor, for their homelands, for greed, for courage, for love, but are never aided by some sort of divinity. This makes ""Troy"" little more than an extended battle scene, divided into several set pieces, some amazing (the fight between Aquilles and Hector is an eye-opener), some a already-seen (those rings movies already defined and claimed the massive battle shots we witness here). Of course, as an epic of gigantic proportions it certainly achieves - the shot of a thousand ships sailing to troy is unforgettable. But even if Brad Pitt transpires charisma, and Eric Bana provides a much-needed nobility, this enterprise sounds like little more than Hollywood dollars to the service of popcorn entertainment.

Not faithful to the source material but very entertaining!,"Troy was the first of the recent epic film wave (I'm not counting The Lord of the Rings) and it is by far the best. Alexander was too flawed, Kingdom of Heaven's protagonist was far too weak and King Arthur was... well King Arthur was just plain crap. Not only is the main protagonist of Troy very strong but the film seems much more polished than any of the two other films and the overall cast is only a few steps short of brilliant. Troy is as most people know based on The Illiad but only very superficially. Some of the characters from the book are used but overall the film is very different from the book and in my opinion it was probably for the better. Don't get me wrong the book is excellent but the God element would make the film way too complicating as the Gods would need to be introduced for it to make sense at all. Also the siege lasts about 10 years in the book but in the film it only lasts a couple of weeks and that was another thing which was probably necessary for dramatic purposes.The cast is mainly very good. Brad Pitt is brilliant. He really conveyed the energy of the character, Achilles, very well. His sense of timing and overall presence is undeniable. He does an incredible job in the action sequences he is in and brings the menacing nature of Achilles very well to life. However, he also does a good job in the more intimate scenes where he seems to have great chemistry with Rose Byrne who plays Briseis. Eric Bana was the greatest surprise for me as he did an excellent job in bringing Hector to life. Like Brad Pitt he is brilliant both in the action scenes and emotional scenes. He matches the intensity of Pitt and this makes their final confrontation a true climax. Brian Cox and Brendan Gleeson do excellent jobs with their characters as well and especially Cox who acts in a way that makes Agamemnon seem very devious. Two thumbs up. Peter O'Toole is great and does a seemingly impossible feat in stealing a scene from Brad Pitt. Where the casting fails, however is in that of Orlando Bloom and Diane Kruger. Orlando was never a good actor but in Troy he doesn't even look the part like he does in The Lord of the Rings. He spends his time with a pathetic apologetic look on his face. Its pretty much the same with Kruger. Their chemistry is heinous. The worst I have ever seen. There is absolutely no spark whatsoever between them. I've seen better chemistry between two rocks. Aside from the two aforementioned the cast is very good. One last actor worth mentioning is Sean Bean who produces a very likable character in Odysseus.The action is overall very well done and feels very epic. The combat scenes with Pitt and Bana are very well done and you really get a sense of the different combat styles used. Pitt has a very refined way of fighting. It almost looks like a dance whereas Bana's style seems more like he taught himself and thus looks nowhere near as graceful and this kind of difference in style is very appealing to me. There is another character, Ajax, who is all about brute strength just to name another. There are a few epic battles where the computer effects work great. The effects aren't brilliant like in LotR but they are decent and convincing enough. The true climax, however, is in the final battle between Hector and Achilles which is one of the best choreographed fights I have ever seen. Overall the action is very satisfactory and entertaining. Kudos to the director.The story is well written and much of the dialog is both very sharp and witty and the complete refrain from contemporary expressions was in my opinion a nice touch. Instead the writers came up with other expressions like: ""You sack of wine"". which I found was highly entertaining. The story progresses in a satisfactory manner but after the climactic battle between Hector and Achilles the film does lose some steam. Overall I thought it was a good idea to leave out the whole story with the gods and instead focus on reality was a good thing as the including the gods would have made the film too confusing and far too long.All in all Troy is a very good film and aside from a few glitches in the casting the film is nothing short of excellent and definitely a must-see.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,History

A big screen historic epics, taking a lot of licenses relative to the classic story, re-creating the ancient times via the perspective of the modern American cinema viewer. Some of the characters behave just like Western heroes, some other quote classic text while behaving more like contemporary American politicians or Afghan war-lords. Directing is quite straight-forward, the story is told well, acting is good - especially Peter O'Toole which is a pleasure to see again in a historic role after all these years. It is not art, and if you do not expect anything serious like Greek tragedy and you take it for what it is - popular entertainment - you can enjoy the fights and effects. 7 out of 10 on my personal scale.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Brad Pitt's Achilles fascinating,"This is director Wolfgang Petersen's vision of Homer's epic poem of the Greek tragedy after Trojan prince Paris (Orlando Bloom) takes Helen (Diane Kruger) home to Troy. Her husband Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson) provides his brother Agamemnon (Brian Cox) the perfect excuse to invade Troy bringing along his champion Achilles (Brad Pitt).There is a lot to like about this movie. There are big action scenes. Brad Pitt's Achilles is absolutely fascinating. In many ways, the movie is dragged down by all the intrigue and the various other expositions. The movie is hamstrung by Wolfang trying to do a good and proper job explaining this story. It would be much more compelling if it concentrated on one character preferably Brad Pitt's Achilles. Nevertheless it's a grand overstuffed epic more reminiscent of another era.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Modern look at the Classics: clumsy, rugged yet grand.","Like the sacrificial ox burning to honor ancestors, TROY pays significant homage to the epics that have come before. For a 21st Century Hollywood Machine production on one of the Classics, and taking into account how LORD OF THE RINGS totally spoiled us when it comes to such adaptations, TROY doesn't fare too poorly. Perhaps a little clumsy and rugged at times, especially in the editing, but the well-done casting is able to polish a bit of grandeur onto the epic.Wolfgang Petersen, along with screenwriter David Benioff, present not only a digestible rendition of Homer's poem crafted for the youth of today, but also craft the film as being historical fiction. Gone are the gods' roles and involvement and even Achilles' supernatural origins are obtusely dismissed. Brad Pitt's sculpted Greek form, however, puts him as close to gods as anyone on this mortal plane as his legion of worshippers will attest to.TROY definitely slants to tale to show favor for the film's namesake kingdom. Peter O'Toole, in a much-needed award-winning role, plays Priam with benevolence and wisdom although with perhaps a little too much naiveté when it comes to the gods as opposed to the always- enjoyable Brian Cox's warmongering Agamemnon. Eric Bana's Hector is a warrior family man while Pitt's Achilles is indifferent, and even bored with battle and only fights to preserve his name. Even Helen, who leaves her rabble-rousing husband Menelaus for love and sanctuary in Troy, comes across as being innocent. Only Odysseus, skillfully acted by Sean Bean, comes across as a Greek who knows his place and station and merely wishes to survive. And if surviving means constructing a horse from the boat's lumber, so be it. After all, he has a date with Sersei and the Cyclops later on.Of course the ultimate question is will TROY live on in eternity like Achilles so desperately sought after or will it be dismissed like the setting sun over the Aegean sea?",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Beautiful, but with its weaknesses","I don't really need a movie based on the book to be 100% accurate even if this is such an epic book like The Iliad. There is no need for it, it doesn't take away from the greatness of the book itself just because somebody too the general story and made it to a movie the way he likes it.It does irk me a little bit to see many historical inaccuracies from that time on a big screen. But I think this won't be a problem for many since not everyone will realize that neither architecture, not clothing or war fit the time. I will still take off a few points for that because it bothered me.I wish Patroculus was Achilles' lover and not cousin, just as it is regarded in many books. It would add so much to the movie and make his coming to Troy for revenge so much more passionate.I also didn't like Diane Kruger and Orlando Bloom as Helen and Paris. I do think that they are both great actors and fitted their parts with their looks, but there was no real chemistry there. No way in hell will I believe that this was the reason the war with Troy happened.At the same time I loved other casting. Brad Pitt is perfect for the role of Achilles. He does give one the feeling of being half human half god. Erc Bana is amazing as Hector, he gives the character a lot of depth and always shines when on screen. And there are a lot of other actors worth mentioning.Another thing I wish there was more of is Gods. No need to bring them in as the actual reason of the war, but it would have been nice if they have played an important role in lives of these people like it really was at that time. It would also add a lot of ancient feeling to this movie Would also be nice to cut it a bit shorter. Since they were not accurately following The Iliad, there is no need for almost 3 hours.The show is full of beautiful scenery, like the sun going down over the ocean and the beach or all the battleships approaching Troy. And seeing toned up, Brad Pitt in his warrior skirt makes the movie even more beautiful.This movie has its weaknesses, but it is still worth watching for the entertainment value as long as you are not looking for a historically accurate perfect adaptation of the original story.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A Movie of Epic Proportions,"This year's starting blockbusters of the summer include TROY, but don't expect the movie to be anything like the epic poem, 'The Iliad'. Characters that die in the poem live in the movie and characters that shouldn't die in the movie live in the poem. There's a reason why this movie is called TROY and not 'The Iliad', as the movie's ending credits clearly point out that the movie was 'inspired by the Iliad', so don't watch TROY expecting it will be like 'The Iliad'.TROY, directed by Wolfgang Peterson, is entertaining from start to finish, considering it contains three of the most hottest men in Hollywood: Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, and Orlando Bloom, all in skirts. The movie starts off in ancient Greece, where Trojan Prince Hector (Eric Bana) and Prince Paris (Orlando Bloom) have come to Sparta on a diplomatic mission to make peace with Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson), the Spartan king. Unbeknownst to Menelaus, Helen (Diane Kruger), his wife and Queen of Sparta, is having a passionate affair with Paris, the Prince of Troy. Their love will ignite a war that will lead to endless destruction and devastation of both countries. Thus when Paris steals Helen away, Menelaus is insulted and wages war against Troy with his brother, Agamemnon, (Brian Cox) who finds this a perfect excuse to conquer Troy. But in order to conquer Troy's vast defensive walls, Agamemnon needs the help of Achilles, (Brad Pitt) believed to be the greatest warrior alive. And thus ensues a vicious battle fought over greed, honor, destiny, but most of all, love. And for love, a nation will fall and burn to the ground, leaving history its most devastating story ever.Brad Pitt is perfect as Achilles. Besides his finely chiseled body, which for some reason the director felt had to be shown in almost every scene, his performance truly brought out the defiant, arrogant, rebellious, invincible warrior side of Achilles. However, Pitt's acting was wooden in a few scenes, which is hard to blame him because he is a terrific actor and it isn't his fault his lines sound so lame. The fault goes to the atrocious script that David Benioff wrote and the terrible soundtrack James Horner offers. Orlando Bloom as Paris, still needs to hone his craft; however, he played Paris convincingly enough for the audience to understand that Paris is a womanizing, pathetic excuse for a warrior. His best scene is when he loses to Menelaus and crawls back to his brother, clutching his brother's leg, imploring Hector to save him, showing the coward that Paris really is.But the true star and savior of the movie is Eric Bana with his excellent portrayal of Hector, the heir and Prince of Troy. His performance was truly memorable and his screen presence was captivating; he was one of the film's few truly sympathetic characters. Bana is very convincing as this passionate father, son, husband, and warrior all wrapped into one human being. His battle scene with Pitt is perhaps the best and most riveting fight scene of all time. Bana conveyed perfectly all the expressions of love, anger, fear, hatred, pride and suffering in his eyes, while Brad just looked fierce the whole time, even in his death; the only exception was when Achilles sobs over Hector's body, which was Pitt's best scene. Helen's scenes, played by Diane Kruger, are nothing short of contrived; in fact, they're barely bearable. She looks stupid half the time and there is no chemistry between her and Bloom, but she is no doubt beautiful, but it is very hard to believe that her face is the face that launched a thousand ships. Instead, Saffron Burrows who plays Andromache gives easily the best performance out of all the female characters. The chemistry between her and Bana is very believable.In the end, it all comes down to Eric Bana's brilliant deliverance and TROY's terrific CGI sequences. The choreographing for the battle scenes can be at times, tiring but it's nothing like The Matrix Reloaded's monotonous fight scenes, in fact the battle scenes in TROY were very well done, but don't expect any Oscar award winning performances, save Eric Bana's. TROY is just a nice summer blockbuster to get viewers excited about Spider-Man 2 and Harry Potter 3. It's a nice way to spend $9.50 and 3 hours in a movie theatre, plus it's a perfect excuse to watch and drool over three very good-looking men with very chiseled bodies.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Homer's Troy...not quite but close enough,"Rarely these days do film makers attempt to make movies on such a grand scale that involve characters of legend. Its a daunting undertaking.Troy sits in that zone of pretty good, could have been better and thankfully not worse.It does have its flaws but they are easily overcome, generally by the credible performances of the cast and the strength of the core story.I'm also thankful that this is a long movie, much shorter and the compression (or omission) of story elements would have had a major negative impact. As a longer film it does deliver well with pacing, never allowing the view to get bored.Have fun with it :)",7.0,Anonymous,History
The True story had been.....desTROYed,"Yesterday I finally bought the TROY DVD. However my disappointment was enormous.The epic story of Homerus is twisted in the most extraordinary way.The producers/directors whoever  most probably have not read the whole Iliada.In conclusion, apart from the fact they present the Greeks been idiots and war thirsty, they skip one of the most tragic moments of the war. The Ifigenia's sacrifice to goddess Artemis in order for Greeks to sail the port of Aylida.Just for the record this sacrifice is one of the best plays by Sofokles and is called Ifegenia En Aylidi (free translation Ififenia at the port of Aylida). And of course since there had been no sacrifice Agamemnon dies in Troy.For your information as per Homerus, Agamemnon was killed by his wife as he was taking his bath when he returned form Troy. Famous Klytemnistra killed her husband because he did sacrifice their daughter to Artemis in order for the Greek vessels to leave Aylida. And definitely he was not killed by any Trojan girl by the name of Brhshida.Another peculiar thing is that Achilles died in deed by Paris but along time ago before we, Greeks entered Troy. It was disgusting and very insulting to the epic story to see Achilles dies inside the burning Troy with several arrows on his chest and belly as Achilles was invulnerable because his father Pileas baptized him in a blessed water when he was an infant but as he was holding him upside down he did not sink his feet holding him from his ankles. That is why his only vulnerable spot was his heels. That means that only one arrow was enough to kill him at his heel.This was a point that should be highlighted. It was not the fact that Achilles was a blood thirty warrior who he was just capable of being a 'Jean Claud Vandam' of ancient Greece beating any opponent. HE WAS JUST INVULNERABLE. He could not be killed. Furthermore he was killed by Paris indeed (one of the few things according to the story) but not in order to save his cousin, but after Hector's death as revenge and after Apollo revealed to Paris that Achilles has only one week spot.One thing more is that according to Homerus, the war lasted ten years. It seems in the movie it lasted what???? A few weeks?In addition there are many other points created out of director's mind and not according to the original.I really feel that from now on, anyone who really wants to make a great movie must very very carefully read the original. However I understand that some things cannot be presented to cinema like in the original. But this is a totally different thing than twisting is that disgusting way story.It is like for someone to make in 1,000 years a movie about world was 2 and describing Hitler as the good guy or even more to say that Hitler did not commit suicide but he was killed by Winston Churchill or Abraham Lincoln after they had decided to fight each other and whoever wins the other troops will surrender. Just imagine that. How stupid it is. But it is what the producers of Troy have done.I would be really glad to find copies of Iliada translated in English and to send them as gifts to the production.",1.0,Anonymous,History
The Director's Cut is a definite improvement.,"(This is a review of the Director's Cut of Troy, which is significantly longer, more brutal, and better overall than the theatrical version. There's more time for character development and the battles are much more intense. It's definitely the version to watch.)Troy plays fast and loose with history and Greek Mythology, but it ends up being a pretty entertaining movie, as a result. And really, isn't that the point?Yes, Brad Pitt as Achilles and Orlando Bloom as Paris are direct and blatant ploys to get butts in theater seats, but they're certainly not bad. The hodgepodge of accents can be a distraction, but the cast is likable (Sean Bean as Odysseus was a favorite of mine) and there are equal parts drama and epic battles to keep a wide audience satisfied. Lots of blood, noble, lusty heroes, beautiful women, and a pretty spectacular take on the ultimate fall of Troy.This movie doesn't quite reach the heights of the best movies in the genre, but it mostly achieves what it sets out to do: put a fresh take on one of the oldest and most famous stories of war.",7.0,Anonymous,History
It can be enjoyable also for classicists,"A book entitled ""I Greci al cinema""(=""The Greeks on the screen.

Troy by Wolfgang Petersen is very well considered by these scholars.Vito Zagarrio (III University of Rome) advises ""to enjoy the glamorous special effects, to enter the new digital universe that allows any journey across the time"" and to ""enjoy the magnificent duels, especially the one between Hector and Achilles"".

"Passion, blood, catharsis","I often had the impression that Greek legends are just about people loving each other and being unhappy because of that. 'Troy' is an excellent example of that, as couples love each other extreme, but none of them have a beautiful life in peace. Men do love their spouse, but they love more pride, honor, glory and patriotism, so they leave to fight against each other, they are being killed on the battlefield and women are left alone in tears and perhaps this is why they are loved by their women. I think these are all real values, no problem with that; however on my list of values love for my wife and family comes before some honor of a victory.If you are not familiar with the legend of the Trojan War, just relax, as the story differs from the usual storyline known from the most known interpretations - the 'Iliad' or the 'Odyssey' of Homer or from the later Roman book II of Virgil's 'Aeneid' - at several points and you would be probably upset examining which parts are conform to the ancient literature and which aren't. I don't see it as a problem, as in my understanding a legend is a legend because you can alter it if you like. So here's a little summary of Petersen's simplified version, which contains just the right amount of happening for a movie.We have the Greeks on the West, led by power hungry king Agamemnon (Brian Cox). He loves war and takes every opportunity to conquer on a new land. This way, he turns almost all the neighboring kingdoms to be his servant and their soldiers to fight for him. On the West, we have Troy, separated from the Greeks by the sea, almost the only kingdom resisting the Greek attacks, ruled by the old and wise king Priam (Peter O'Toole). King Priam sends his two sons, the elder Hector (Eric Bana) and the younger Paris (Orlando Bloom), to make peace with one of the kingdoms in Greece, Sparta. However, in Sparta, Paris falls in love with Helen (Diane Kruger), wife of Menelaus (Brandon Gleeson), king of Sparta. So, on the way back, Paris simply eloped Helen on his boat. Here we go, Menelaus gets angry, wants his wife back, and king Agamemnon is just happy to have an apropos to gather all his armies and attack Troy. They sail over to the shores of Troy and the war begins. A key element in the war is super hero soldier and king of Myrmidons, Achilles (Brad Pitt) and the of course the large wooden horse. Though in the legends the war lasts for 10 years, here in the film it is only a couple of days.However, in the 2.5 hours of the DVD, there was way too much blood for me. Achilles, then great Greek warrior opens the movie by a triumph over Boagrius, the we go on watching soldiers fall in various ways, however I just got tired having every ten minutes someone with his blood spreading out. Of course, this movie is about a legend of a great war, but it was just too much for me.I was happy for the lack of Gods being shown on screen - people pray to them, call for them, there are temples and statues of them, but except a short appearance of the mother of Achilles in the beginning, fortunately no any God appears. We see things happening 'from the Earth' perspective and this way everything were so real compared to those 'fairy tale' like adaptations I had seen in my childhood. Otherwise, I got the most popular aspects of the Greek legend I expected: beautiful Helen taken away by Trojan prince Paris, the giant wooden horse full of Greeks and hero Achilles being hit on his tendon.Before I started to watch the film, I had the impression this won't be a romantic comedy and it really wasn't. 30 minutes before the end I became sure that all heroes I got to like during the story will die soon - after several hits on each side, the war finally gets an ending when the Greeks pretended to withdraw, leaving behind them a large wooden horse with a raiding party concealed inside. When the Trojans brought the horse into their city, the hidden Greeks opened the gates to their comrades, who then sacked Troy, massacred its men, and carried off its women. Ergo there's no happy ending and you live the cinema with this certain though complete but pleasing sadness.The extent to which the story reflects actual historical events is not known, and the version in the film remembers me to the Medieval European writers, who unacquainted with Homer at first hand, found in the Troy legend a rich source of heroic and romantic storytelling and a convenient framework into which to fit their own courtly and chivalric ideals; see the French 'Roman de Troie' (1154) or the English 'The Recuyell of the Histories of Troye' (1474).In summary, the movie reaches to be monumental, with a huge number of extra, with pictures, colors, landscapes, costumes being magnificent throughout the film, however we don't get that outstanding acting like in Ben Hur or Cleopatra, therefore I rate it 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Cool film about the futility and tragedy of war.,"Nice adaptation of Homer's classic ""The Iliad.""Although a bit sensationalistic, this is a fine film, blowing life into the bones of the lost souls of Ancient Greece.In essence, this story is about the deconstruction of the myth of the Greek war hero - as in any war, there are no winners; only loses and survivors, who may have won a few insignificant battles, but ultimately lost the most important battle of all - namely the fight for Peace.This also applies very much to the current situation in Europe - namely the senseless war between Russia and Ukraine - with Putin having been waging his war in Ukraine for nine and a half years.As Acting President of Russia, the UN, EU, UK and USA, we will end Putin's illegal war on Ukraine; by bringing Vladimir Putin to Justice and withdrawing all Russian troops from Ukraine - so that Peace can be restored.The Path to Peace may lie in effective security guarantees for both Russia and Ukraine through an overarching European Security Treaty. Only this may create the conditions for Russia and Ukraine to achieve a negotiated settlement to their conflict. Any solution must guarantee Ukraine's independent sovereignty and territorial integrity. It must also address Russia's legitimate security concerns.It should also be noted, that as a product of the Cold War, NATO has not constituted an effective overarching institutional security architecture, something that has been fundamentally lacking, in effect, ever since 1945.Hence we intend to implement the replacement of NATO by a new International Peacebuilding Alliance (IPA) - one Peace has been restored and Vladimir Putin has resigned.Love and Light,
Mark / President of Russia - EU - POTUS - UNITED NATIONSPS: The legend of Achilles and his mother Thetis - whose magic made him almost invulnerable - also symbolizes very much the Christian belief, that the purest form of Love in this world, is the Love that a mother has for her child - probably also the psychological reason why so many girls want to experience motherhood :) After all, there might be some sex and humping between a girl and a dude; but that's mainly sensual stuff :)In short, at the end of the day, all mothers want to protect their sons. And all mothers are devastated when their sons die in war - both in Ukraine and Russia. Hence Peace must be manifested in this world. Period.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"Right up there with ""Ishtar"" and ""The Bible"".","In the overall scheme of making movies based upon classical literature, this is one of the worst attempts I've seen in my 63 years.

It amazes me that the director of this movie directed ""Das Boot"". So, I supposed some hard examples are in order, so here's a few: (1) ""The Iliad"" has nothing whatsoever to do with the Trojan Horse; (2)Achilleus, probably one of the most complex characters in all literature, is not a hybrid between Conan The Barbarian, a Zen Buddhist and the father, on ""Married w/Children; (3)The ""Atriadae"", Meneleus and Agamemnon, had an entirely different fate than that in the movie, and without those fates, the entire sense of the story has vanished; (4)With the possible exception of O'Toole's Priam, all the characters essences were stood on their heads, and (5)The Theme(s) of the epic was utterly lost.

Troy was easily a 10 (Excellent),"Troy was excellent. Definitely not over exaggerated or boring. Based on reading ""The Iliad"" and watching the movie itself, I was highly impressed. David Benioff also innovated such a wonderful script for these amazing actors to follow upon. The movie was much more diverse than to be expected and very unpredictable; as it possessed Adventure, Drama, Action, War, and Romance movie genres. The Epic was very clear and not confusing, yet effecting. Lucinda Syson knew exactly who should have played these roles, when she picked out the wonderful cast members. Brad Pitt was the perfect choice when it came to portraying the handsome brute warrior Achilles and Eric Bana was the perfect choice to for the role of Hector (soldier and prince of Troy). Peter O'Toole as King Priam (King of Troy)totally enlightened the story and made it more vivid, as his character was a spark to add to the movie. Brian Cox once again pulled the movie through, by playing the perfect villain, Agamemnon. I think when Wolfgang Peterson created this movie, he had the word ""life"" in mind, as he brought the story to life. He took a fictional movie and made it very real. The plot totally focused on realism and the war was very believable. The battles, fights, the swords, the archery, i.e. is completely fascinating and so realistic that you will have chills. Peter Honess edited the movie to perfection. James Horner knew how to create a theme song and was wise to pick Josh Groban to sing ""Remember Me"" (as Josh has an amazing voice) This movie defines the term used by Sun Tzu ""Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer"". People who dislike this movie, obviously don't understand it. If you have never watched this movie, I highly suggest watching this movie, as it is easily a 10.",,Anonymous,History
"A good job by Peterson and his cast and crew, could've been better, could've been worse...","Wolfgang Peterson and David Benioff's adaptation of Homer's Illiad story, about the battles and people beneath one of the greatest wars in human history, is like a 2nd place science fair project by a kid in middle school. You're impressed, but there's still some things that keep it from the prize.  Troy is loaded with CGI visuals carried over in tradition from Gladiator and LOTR, has wonderful cinematography by Roger Pratt, and certain scenes and performances are near perfect (Peter O'Toole in particular).  But that doesn't mean Peterson's vision doesn't carry with it some flaws.Some of the visual effects, though intricate and vast, are a little much at times.  In a sense they work well for the production, but I thought the film might've benefited from more extras, much like a big-scale production from the Golden age of Hollywood.  Stars like Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, and Orlando Bloom are more or less capable to hold up the film, with Pitt creating conflict and poise in his Achilles where it sometimes isn't needed, Bana creating a directness with what's around him, and Bloom giving some over-acting (or under-acting) for his Paris.  The female characters aren't of much praise and speculation except that their main part in the film is to discourage the men from fighting.  This, as well as the score by James Horner with a single female singing voice in most battle scenes, gets a little much as well.It seems as though Peterson is fond of dramatic excess in this film, and it serves as both an asset and a crutch.  For example, in the fight scene between Achilles and Hector, there are repeated cut-aways to close-ups with the royal family looking on.  This would be fine if it wasn't interferring so much with the action going on.  This same focus on the fights and battle sequences also gets diverted with the score and cut-aways.  But the good side to this is that this stylized, glossy, and occasionally brutal action gets pumped up.  That's how I felt overall about this picture- it's exciting, interesting summer fare, but it won't be a big contender against the epics of the past, or even the other action films due this summer and year.

News from Trojan War era,"My name is Diomeda, a female slave of Achilles'. I tried to attract his attention when Briseis was not his lover yet. But it was not that simple: so many girls fell in love with Achilles...even Trojan girls, such as princess Polyxena. So, if you read the Ilias, you will find my name. Only once, in the ninth book. But Patroclus advised Achilles to choose Briseis...ans so they got rid of me. Now look at the movie: I am the girl who sleeps with Achilles at the beginning. In any case, I must admit that all the girls who appear in the movie are characters that you really can find in Homer or in the later mythological tradition. Maybe Briseis is a mix of herself and Polyxena (who helped Priamus to bring home Hector's corpse, and under that circumstance met Achilles and fell in love with him). But in Mario Camerini's ""Ulisse"" (1954), Silvana Mangano is both Penelope and Circes, and Circe is a mix of herself and Calypso...

Having Read Homer's Iliad...,"I took Western Mythology in high school, and I read the Iliad.  If I hadn't read the book, or epic poem, whatever you wish to call it, I probably would give this movie a nine or ten.As it were, I think this film is worthy of an eight.  The action was excellent, Eric Bana and Brad Pitt were fantastic, and the sets were amazing.The only thing I was disappointed in were the inconsistencies between the movie and the Iliad.  First off, Menelaus and Agamemnon do not die in Troy. They are both killed in their homes.  Ajax (or Aias, as he was called in the book) also doesn't die until after the war.  He loses a footrace to Odysseus for Achilles' armor and kills himself because he felt like he was cheated. I didn't mind Ajax being killed as much as the others, because it did help in the progression of the movie, and portraying Hector as a great warrior and a hero for his people.I did not like that there was no indication of how much time passed during the course of the war.  The Trojan War was ten years long, and there was never any mention of that.Contrary to what people have been saying, Orlando Bloom did an excellent job of portraying Paris.  Paris is by nature a coward, and selfish.  He does not think of others before thinking of himself.  The role was played well, and the part was written accurately.One thing that was integral to Achilles' return to the battle was left out. When Patroclus wore his armor into battle, and Hector kills him, Hector takes Achilles' armor and wears it on the field.  Achilles is brought new armor, made by the gods, by his mother Thetis, a goddess, who played too small a role (you only see her picking up seashells before he leaves for war), I felt.Aeneas' involvement was also something I felt was missed.  You only meet him in the movie when Paris gives him the Sword of Troy and tells him to take the people through the tunnel.  Aeneas was Troy's best soldier after Hector, the son of a goddess.  He is wounded by Diomedes (a character I was disappointed didn't make an appearance) and is taken off of the field of battle, which leads to his journeys in Virgil's Aeneid.One thing I loved, Sean Bean as Odysseus.  I loved him in this role.  I would very much like to see him play the same character in an adaptation of The Odyssey.Achilles also lived far too long in the movie.  He did not live long enough to see the inside of Troy,  he dies on the battlefield, and never sees the Trojan Horse.One simple thing the peeved me, the pronunciation of Brendan Gleeson's character's name.  They pronounce it ""Men-uh-louse"" when the recognized pronunciation of it has always been ""Men-uh-lay-us.""Don't get me wrong, overall, it was a good film, well acted, well shot, well edited.

Troy: Best movie ever!!!!,"Troy is the best movie ever. I love the movie but I do not like it how Achilles dies. I know he had to die but did he have to die in those contexts. Like he was defenseless and Paris was attacking him when he was not doing anything wrong. Sure he thought he was going to hurt his cousin but still she said ""Stop"" ""Don't"" like why wouldn't he listen to her. I like it how Achilles was a kind person. He was supposed to be a mean person but he was a very kind person. I also like it how there was a love story involves with Achilles and Breseis. But I think that Paris should have been killed, instead of living. I do not like that at all. Whenever I watch the movie I always cry at the end because it is the saddest thing ever. And then at the very end of the movie it played the song ""Remember"" and I cry even more because it is a very sad song. I love Troy and it is my favourite movie and it always will be no matter what. I would definitely recommend watching the movie because if you didn't watch it then you would be missing out on something very good. If you didn't see it then you would have a part of you that would be missing. I hope that someone will be influence to watch Troy because it is the best movie of all time.",7.0,Anonymous,History
empty characterization,"A real disappointment. Historical movies are so scarce these days that I badly wanted to like this movie more than anything in my decent movie going history but had to watch in between my yawns how in a tediously boring way the movie was parsed together. I really miss the old Hollywood style of using real actors in situations where thousands of extras were used (read Spartacus) to visualize the mass battles. The CGI effect of copying the same thousand extras here was too easy to notice and for me it flattened the visual glory of what it might have been.Brad gave a good performance, Sean Bean was again as natural within his acting maneuvers as a freezer full of frozen ashes and Eric Bana couldn't unfortunately rise above the acting in Chopper or Hulk. Bright star here was Bloom as whimpering gayish Paris.And the ships would have been seen from Troy many many days before they were actually even near the coast if the movie was supposed to have been shot on Tellus.

As a writer, I was in awe of David Benioff, the screenplay writer of this film, and I thought the entire movie was quote-worthy. I wished I had had a paper and pen with me so that I could have written the lines down, they were magnificent. The story was portrayed so that I did not know which man I wanted to survive.

Well made,"I found the 2-DVD version of ""Troy"" in the bargain bin at a local department store. Since it only cost me the equivalent to a few dollars, I decided to buy it. And I was not disappointed.Troy, as most of us know, depicts the Trojan War described in the Iliad.First of all, I would like to make one thing clear - Neither the Iliad nor this movie are in any way historical documents. The Iliad is an old fairytale, whereupon this movie is based. To seek rational explanations for this and that is a waste of time. Consider it for what it is and has always been, a great and very entertaining fairy tale, like the Lord of the Rings is of today.I'll proceed with the review. This movie is a ""slightly"" condensed version of the epic itself. And of course with the necessary touches of hollywoodization added to it. For good or for worse. Being made into a Hollywood movie is usually either the best or the second worst - being made into a Disney cartoon is the worst - thing that could happen to a classic story like the Iliad. But Troy actually manages to end up somewhere in between, which I find rather unusual.As I wrote earlier, the story depicts the Trojan war, a result of the elopement or kidnapping of Helen of Sparta, by prince Paris of Troy. Troy was according to legends - as well as a few historians - a city located in what is today northwest Turkey. A city that by the standards of that day was considered large and prosperous. As well as damn near impregnable, with walls that couldn't be breached or scaled*. And since this war involved the greatest nations of the known world (at least according to the ancient Greeks), it was important enough to involve the gods themselves, who gladly gave their chosen champions a helping hand here and there, as well as taking every opportunity to back-stab their opponents when possible.Unfortunately, every divine or arcane intervention was left out of the Hollywood version, that is basically an action movie set in ancient times. The reason for this is that the filmmakers wanted to make an accurate historical movie, and thus they left out the parts that were considered a bit too unreal to fit in. I fail to see the logic in that decision, though, since the Iliad IS in fact simply that, a fairy tale. Not a historical document**. Didn't they realize that? This means that this movie sometimes feel very real, and since the acting is top notch, some might find it disturbing. Especially since most of us knows how it will end. Throw in a lot of blood and gore, and there you go.In my personal opinion, this was a really bad call. I mean, doesn't this movie really cry out for a sequel? No, I'm not thinking about ""Troy II - Paris revenge"" *duh*, I mean the Odyssey. But how could you make a watchable movie out of the Odyssey without the fairy tale part? Remove that, and you end up with a boring and probable box office bomb about some guy getting really, really, really lost on his way home from Troy.The ""fairy tale"" bits'n parts that were left out aren't the only changes the script writers made. Although many of the characters from the original Iliad are represented in this movie - and by very skilled actors as well - there are some changes that have been made to their personalities, traits and fates. Some, like me, might dislike that, but it's just a movie anyway. And as I wrote, it is a bit condensed, especially the time-frame. In the Iliad, the Greeks spent ten years outside the walls of Troy, until they finally realized that their current tactics weren't working, and that they should try something new. In the movie it is a matter of weeks.Even though the script writers and filmmakers have made a lot of changes*** to the story, Troy remains quite a watchable movie. Removing the fairy tale part and trying to make a historical movie was a mistake though, for that is what the Iliad and the Odyssey is - Ancient fairy tales that have survived through time, thanks to a literary genius in ancient Greece.-----------------* This happened long before siege engines was invented. They didn't even have iron back then. Metal objects were made out of bronze, thus it was called the bronze age. On the other hand, siege engines hadn't been of much use, since in reality it's likely that there never even existed walls and fortifications like those of Troy back then. Buildings were small, city walls were low, ships were short, swords were weak and soft, armor gave little protection, etc.** We don't know if Troy ever existed. Archaeologists have found remains of at least one ancient city in that area of Turkey, not necessarily the actual city of Troy. Quite a number of fairly large cities existed around the Mediterranean sea during the bronze age, and most of them have been lost. In short, there are no conclusive evidence that support the claims that Troy have been found.*** There are changes that are necessary to make the movie watchable. And there is always the possibility of improvements. At the same time, you should - as a filmmaker or script writer - ask yourself this question: Will I be remembered as a one of the greatest writers of all time in a couple of thousand years, comparable to Homer or William Shakespeare? If you feel that ""no"" would be the most suitable answer to that question, don't make changes that aren't necessary. And make no improvements.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Makes Gladiator seem like child's play,"Gladiator won Best Picture at the Oscar's. It was a joke then, but now that Troy is out, it is especially clear how Gladiator was a trifle compared to Troy.Troy is film-making as good as it gets when it comes to complex and difficult subject matter compressed into a movie less than 3 hours long. Wolfgang Petersen doesn't have the sumptuous and warm visual aesthetic of Ridley Scott, but stages the fight scenes and battles beautifully and gives us locations and buildings and uniforms we've not seen before. Troy has a much more you-are-there feel about it than any other film about the Classical Age.Gladiator homogenized and made pretty its ugly world, and had so much CGI, you almost thought you were watching a George Lucas film.Troy gives us extras in uniform for the battle scenes, hundreds of them at least, if not thousands. The CGI is kept to a bare minimum and the difference really shows.Let us remember that Troy is based on The Ilaid and the story covers at least 10 years. So it is no small feat to compress the timeline.I wasn't thrilled with the choice of removing the supernatural from the story, or the homosexual relationship between Achilles and Patroclus - two of the central pillars upon which this epic story is built. But, hey, this is Hollywood, and we have Oliver Stone for the homosexual love story in his version of Alexander the Great (to Stone's credit he didn't shy away from the reality of this actual historic figure), and most Americans under the age of 50 are so undereducated and/or dumbed-down that it would take a 2-hour movie just to explain all of the Greek gods and their significance as it relates to the human characters in the Iliad/Troy.Troy, as is, really works, with no homosexuality (it is obliquely referenced for those who've read the book), and no Mount Olympus gods. Achilles' mother Thetis is a sea-nymph but that is also referenced indirectly.It would have been really cool to see Achilles' new armor glowing, but, Peterson chose to keep his film grounded in the human dimension. An explanation of just why Achilles was vulnerable in his heel (his mother held him there when dipping him in the River Styx to make him invulnerable thus that part was not made invulnerable) would have proved helpful for the purpose of heightening the drama when he is finally felled by Paris at the end.What is great about the film is its pacing, the superb acting by all involved, the look of the film, the visceral and effectively executed battle scenes, and the sense of another time.A weakness of the film is the casting of Helen. My vote would have gone to German actress Xenia Seeberg, but Diane Kruger did a fine job acting-wise... her beauty and presence were not grand, as required though. It would have been nice to have a beauty that was truly breathtaking to underpin the story for the viewer as to why she could launch a ten-year war.The greatest weakness of the film has to be the music. The original score was tossed out and excellent composer James Horner was brought in at the last minute and created a score that lends nothing, really, to the film. Imagine some of the surreal music by Nino Rota from Satyricon in place of Horner's music and you get an idea of how otherworldly and brilliantly the right kind of music could have elevated this film.Despite its minor flaws, I give the film a 10 out of 10 because it is clearly the best film ever made in the genre.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Moderate epic,"Last Wolfgang Petersen movie I liked was ""Never Ending Story"". And now I've found another.I remember critics where little unsure what to make of this Greek epic without gods. Others liked it, others disliked it, I found it very entertaining, yet little bit too long epic, with a punch of great acting and some little less not so good acting.From the actors I have to bring up Eric Bana, whose performance as Hector is above all other young heroes. Brad Pitt is not bad either, but he's been a lot better and in some places he seems a bit lost in the middle of this movie.What comes to Orlando Bloom, well, he still doesn't convince me with his acting skills. Legolas still seems to haunt his career. ""Lord Of The Rings"" is still the only movie he did fit in perfectly.I cannot claim myself to be a scholar of Greek mythology, and so I don't know how much has been left out, besides the gods, and what has been changed and how much, but as adaptations go, this is very good one. I give ""Troy"" a solid 7 from good effort.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Return of the Epic,"I'm not sure why there's a large camp of people who've seen this and regard it as one of the worst movies of 2004. Usually, these are brief, offhand remarks, and don't explain the reasons for this antipathy. I do agree there are definite flaws. Most detractors (and even some fans) believe Brad Pitt was miscast, but I wouldn't go there. Pitt's Achilles is a curious mixture and can be divided almost squarely in two: half the performance is just fine; the other half is not so good. It all depends on what scene we're talking about. An example of the negative is when Achilles and his men are in their boat, on the verge of reaching the beach of Troy. Achilles makes a brief statement to his number two to fight for him. I think Pitt's intent was to make Achilles super-casual in moments like these, when everyone else is tensed up. But it just doesn't work; his line reading reminds me of an office manager asking his assistant to buy some more paper clips. However, there's something to be said for the view that Pitt was born to play this role. There's no getting around the fact that, physically, he is ideal. And, there aren't too many actors, whether thru presence or sheer egomania, who can stare down an entire army and make them feel small. The film, as a whole, is filled with such moments and it's a compulsive re-watching experience, not for the obvious 1000 ships sailing in, but for seeing mythical characters come alive and interact on screen for you. And for, oh yes, seeing Achilles down a giant warrior now & then. Now, as for GOOD line readings, I must mention the actor who impressed me the most - Brian Cox as Agamemnon, the 'pig of a king.' His performance was flawless and his was as a magnetic presence (in some ways, more so) as Pitt's Achilles. The actor Bana was excellent as the strong, heroic Hector and Gleeson great as the brutish King Menelaus. Sean Bean seems well suited for these epics and is very smooth as the legendary Odysseus. O'Toole brought in his usual class as the elderly King Priam. I've missed the Epic; I'm glad it's back.",8.0,Anonymous,History
My Big Fat Greek Tragedy,"I didn't expect it, but this was surprisingly good.Although some viewers might expect this to be an epic of Brad Pitt running around in a cocktail dress, it isn't by far.In fact Peter O'Toole(Priam), Brian Cox (Agamemnon) , Brendan Gleeson (Menelaus), Eric Bana (Hector), along with Brad Pitt (Achilles) are all excellent, right down to the bitter end.The story is the story of Troy, although somewhat condensed and does 'outline', Homer's epic work.The special effects are excellent. The presentation just borders the classical stage, and the portrayals of these tragic heroes brought to life will appeal to your conception of the ancient Greeks of legend.Some sound effects are a bit over done, like sword 'clanking' and infantry charges, that sound more like cattle drives, and there is a heavy base overtone, that detracts from beautiful, and well placed vocals.So forget those expensive translations, toss out those 'Cliff Notes' and get Troy, a reborn classic.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Its not history or the legend, just damn good film making","Your ""Loath to Love"" quota for this film will depend on two important factors, first what do you think of Brad Pitt? If you hate him stay away. Second you have to throw out the idea that this is anything other than suggested by the historical/legendary event, if you can do that you're golden.Since I like Brad Pitt and am not bothered by historical accuracy, especially involving one we really know little about I fell in love with this movie. I think this is a grand spectacle of the sort they don't make any more- or didn't until computers made it easier to do so. This is dark brooding heroes and wondrous action. This is why I love movies, you go somewhere else for three hours and just let it wash over you.The only major flaw seems to be the fact that once the horse shows up it races to the end much much too fast.I can not argue the purists who want the story as told over the centuries, but allowing that they condense a ten year, very complicated story into just under three hours, its amazing. I will whole heartedly  say that the removal, or at least the questioning of the Gods role in things  makes it even more tragic since we are the ones who made the mistake and as such we have no one to blame but ourselves.The cast is across the board good to excellent, with Peter O'Toole a certainty for an Oscar nom, if not award next year. I also want to take back some of the terrible things I said about Eric Bana in the Hulk. At last he has a role that explains why he was given the role in that film (even if it doesn't explain why he was so flat there.) Here Bana is a wonderful Hector, a man who's love for his brother brings everything down around him. We feel for his pain.This is an excellent film, 9 out of 10, for a last twenty minutes in need of lengthening.",9.0,Anonymous,History
First movie better seen in full screen,"I know that there're debates about artistic purity in seeing a wide screen movie edited for full screen, but I truly believe that Troy is the first movie that's actually better seen in full screen format.The focus is much clearer on full screen edition, and you won't lose any information seeing it in this format.Brad Pitt is great in this movie. His moves, and his acting are all spot on as Achilles. I also didn't know that Eric Bana was such a good physical actor until I saw this movie. The only cast I wish was more convincing was Helen. She actually looked like a girl next door and not the exotic beauty that we imagine Helen to be. So it's not totally convincing to say that she had the power to launch 1000 ships. If only they were able to dig deeper into casting of this role, the movie would have been better.Production is of epic proportion and captures the atmosphere of the city and the battle well. Purist might complain that the story is not accurate to history, but if Achilles actually chased Hector couple of times around the walls of Troy in this movie, that would take up all the show time.If you're planning to see this movie, try the full screen version. You won't be disappointed. I just wish that DVDs produced stuck to the standard encoding format.

Troy...Oh Boy!,"There is greatness afoot in this movie. It comes from the Director, the actors and of course the story of the Iliad itself. Beautifully filmed and easy to follow my only complaint was that it didn't last longer when I saw it in the theater. I saw it again on cable and even bought the DVD. But then, I discovered the Blue-ray which added 30 extra minutes giving me closure on the issue once and for all. If someone said to you, choose a side: The Greeks or the Trojans? Then it becomes a personal war because you study closely what your choice is doing and why. Lots of lessons here for runaway egos, pride and smugness and in the end we all get what we deserve. The battle scenes here come across as very realistic and make no mistake. You fight until you cannot fight anymore. There is no yelling for a medic at the top of your lungs. Also note that the swinging of a sword tires one out more than you would think making even the most brutal warriors vulnerable after a short time.

Peter O'Toole in his most memorable role since Lorens of Arabia. His night talk with Achilles made my hart sink. Salute to all cast n crew, specially to the film editor, whose sense for balance and rhythm of a 3+ hour's movie is staggering.

Troy,"The arrival of Troy heralded slightly unfair expectations  all the critics expected it to be just like Gladiator. But why? They are not the same. Let's get this cleared up right now  they're not set in the same period, the same country, nor are they about a similar topic. One is about a war, the other a personal vendetta. One is made up, the other is based on stories told over 3,000 years ago. In fact, one could almost say that the only things they have in common are sandals and swords. Oh, and remarkably everyone speaks English. Which is helpful.Troy is a much more epic film than Gladiator, and this clearly shows in its impressive production values, whether it's the awesome sight of the 1,000 ships sailing across the Aegean Sea, or the brutal battle scenes  everything looks right. However, whilst this is all well and good, the problems stem from the source material itself.The credits claim the film was ""inspired by The Iliad"", and here is the first problem. The film is historically inaccurate, and this is most obvious towards the end. The Iliad is the story of Achilles, and does not involve the infamous Wooden Horse, or even the sack of Troy. These are covered in later epics The Odyssey and Virgil's The Aeneid. It's as if the director never read these works, and made up the rest of the story as he went along. Not that it makes too much difference to the story, but those familiar with the epics will feel cheated. Also the motives for the war, whilst they made absolute sense in the society in which the stories were first told, don't hold true anymore. In the epics the stories were concerned with heroes, honour and love. That this war was started because Paris stole someone else's girl just doesn't sit well with a modern audience, and so they cannot relate to these heroes. It doesn't help with the fact that the audience doesn't know which side they should be rooting for  there are in the epics no real ""goodies"" and ""baddies"", merely two nations each with their own heroes. The director has to take time every now and again to reiterate the reasons for the war, that of Paris' love for Helen, but tries to give a more believable reason by giving Brian Cox's character of Agamemnon a more imperialistic bent, deviating further from his source.I've managed to make Troy seem like a disaster, but it is in fact far from it. If the audience can just accept the reasons for the war, then there is little problem in enjoying the rest of the film. The beginning is slow to get going, but once Achilles (Brad Pitt) and Hector (Eric Bana) have their one-on-one clash, the film reaches a momentum it does not lose. The battle scenes easily rival any seen on the big screen to date, and most of the cast do an impressive job in portraying their heroes in varying degrees of suffering. Honours should be given to Eric Bana for his role as the suitably regal heir to Troy, who suffers the wrath of Achilles in a simply choreographed yet remarkably compelling clash, and to Peter O'Toole who plays Hector's father and king of Troy, Priam. Also, contrary to most critical response, Brad Pitt plays the character of Achilles with a suitable display of bravery, power and shows one hell of a temper, even though after his fight with Hector his motivation for staying is lost. Orlando Bloom's Paris is a little weak, turning into Legolas-without-the-wig towards the end, and Diane Kruger's Helen lacks interest, but otherwise the cast are fine. Aside from a few niggles - including a fairly clunky script which does the film no favours - and an extensive running time, Troy is an enjoyable film, which deserves to sit high up in the ranks of sword-and-sandal epics.Rated: 7.5/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",7.0,Anonymous,History
The Epic to Beat,"Title: Troy Directed By: Wolfgang Peterson Starring: Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, Peter O'Toole, Brian Cox, Brenden Gleeson, Sean Bean, Rose Byrne, Diane Kruger Rating: 8/10Where to start, where to start? Troy is, in my opinion, one of the greatest achievements in film history. The reviews are quite mixed, some like it, some don't. Thats the way it is with this film though, you either love it or you hate it. There is no ""middle"", really. That is what is killing this movie when it comes to the feedback. Fortunately, though, the majority of the reviews are positive.I have seen this film 3 times in the theatre. Each time is just got even better. I had never read The Iliad before I saw Troy. I vaguely knew the story, just the fact that the Greeks destroyed Troy by tricking them with a Trojan Horse. 'The Simpsons' helped somewhat on the background, as they also had an episode on The Trojan War. Of course, though, I didn't take everything to be entirely correct, whether it be The Simpsons or Troy. When it comes to a historical film, it is very rare you find one that is completely free of Hollywood's twists and additions.Homer purists will HATE this movie. Well, most of them anyways. Each purist I have spoken to have not liked this movie. It goes the same with LOTR purists. They are so attached with the original story that they cannot bend the lines a bit. Since Troy is so far off from The Iliad (remember, people, it was ""Inspired By"", NOT based!) they just cannot cope with all of the changes. Both minor and major.People have to understand, though. When you hear a historical story is going to be made into a major summer blockbuster, with an A-List cast, do you REALLY think they will stick to the story completely? Yes, I assumed they wouldn't stray as far off as they did with Troy, but still. The people on these boards are over-reacting just a tad. I expect some emails yapping about this or that, but honestly? I don't care, and you want to know why? This is my personal opinion.Yes, if you say ""Well, me not liking Troy is my personal opinion, too."" Thats true! It is! But those who are spamming the boards with ""TROY SUCKS"" or ""WHAT A TERRIBLE FILM, JUST TERRIBLE!"" and not even giving a good reason why they didn't like it, just don't seem to get that this is a Hollywood version of The Iliad.So, please, please, PLEASE think your post/review over before posting it here. Troy was a fantastic, entertaining film, and all of the actors did a wonderful job in their roles.

"Engrossing and gorgeous as a spectacle, as history, and as drama for our times","This is a truly contemporary view of these ancient events, complete with religious ""fundamentalist"" priests guiding political leaders into erroneous directions with tragic results, and warrior heroes seeing the folly of war but helpless to redirect their own actions. The spectacle is beyond the old films of the 40's and 50's and strives to be as authentic as possible in detail, without reaching so far as to create an artistic fantasy like ""Amadeus"". Archaology and travel buffs can revel in the realistic beauty of the sites while history buffs are discomforted only minimally by the most minor and inconsequential diversions away from Homer's narrative. Bloom plays true to the historical profile of Paris-- no hero, but a real person from our own times-- perhaps someone we know personally: vain, impulsive, irresponsible, and noble too late. Pitt is, surprisingly enough, a convincing Achilles, one of whom Homer himself would probably have approved. For all its length, it was over too soon for me.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Better than expected. Much better.,"You'd think this film was another Ishtar if you'd paid attention to some of the critics when it came out. Troy is a modern-day epic loosely based on the poem of Homer written centuries ago. We see what happens when young prince Paris (Orlando Bloom) seduces and steals away with another king's wife and takes her back to the heavily fortified city of record. All the kingdoms of Greece align and attack the city with everything they've got. The result is one hell of an entertaining film.I am not well versed in ancient Greek history or mythology. Apparently this film differs greatly from Homer's poem, but since I am only vaguely familiar with the story, that was not a problem for me. Much of the mythology surrounding the story was dropped to make it look like a historically plausible picture. We are left with a story about warlords who pray to Greek gods, but are very much mortal.The film has large cast made up of great actors (O'Toole, Cox, Bean) and people who are just nice to look at (Pitt, Bloom, Kruger). The script has some cheesy lines, but most of the actors give as much dignity as they can to them. Apparently this film was a very negative experience for O'Toole who was reportedly so unhappy with director Wofgang Petersen, that he refused to see the final product. That's unfortunate, since O'Toole gives the film's best performance. Brad Pitt plays a brooding and vengeful Achillies. His acting skills aren't quite right for this part, but any women in the audience are sure to be impressed by his physique. It took him nearly six months to attain those muscles, and the results are impressive for any man his age.The battle scenes are brutal and exciting. There are some characters in this film that can whip some butt. Eric Bana and Brad Pitt have a fun, but too brief one on one match at one point. The large-scale archery effect is getting a little old. We've already seen it in Braveheart, Gladiator, and the Lord of the Rings movies, so the spectacle isn't as awesome this time. Most of the effects are computer generated, but look good enough.The film is a little long, but it won't cause you to daydream. The film had ridiculously high budget ($185,000,000), and it failed to make that money back in theaters. DVD sales and rentals over the years may yet make it a profitable venture. Heck, even Waterworld has about broken even after all these years of being on the market for home ownership.If you're looking for an exciting story with tremendous production values, then Troy is right for you. I consider it to be a superior film to Gladiator, and that one snuck away with an Oscar.9 of 10 stars. The Hound has spoken.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Some comments from the king of Ilion,"Are you surprised? Of course, it is only a joke. In the ancient archives of Hattusas, a group of archaeologists found the name of Alaksandu, king of Wilusa, and identified this man with Paris/Alexandros, prince of Troy, son of Priamus an brother of Hector. It is a little odd that Homer portrayed me (oops...Paris) as a silly, inconsistent woman chaser. But as Troy, in the thirteenth century B.C. was the most powerful city in the Aegean sea, it is natural that Helen, daughter of Zeus, followed me: Helklen was a goddess, and represented ROYALTY, just like some Oriental goddesses such as Inanna and Ishtar. But I don't mean to annoy you. On the other hand, I am ANNOYED by some big mistakes that I read in some reviews of Troy. The movie is very good, the acting fine, the archaeological reconstruction of places and monuments excellent (especially as regards Agamemnon's palace and the walls of Troy). But above all, Achilles and Patroclus were REALLY cousins. Hesiod says so, other ancient sources confirm this statement. So, please, stop mocking the readers by saying that Troy is a homophobic movie. It is only faithful to the mythological tradition.",10.0,Anonymous,History
How do you like them Golden Apples?,"The movie is colossal, spectacular, stupendous, gongoristic, monumental, and secular.What happened to the GODS? I mean the whole thing started with Eris and that damme golden apple and vain Aprhodite -- whom I would not want backing me in a war, I'll tell you. Yes. It's a godless movie, no doubt propagated by some leftist Commies in Hollywood. Oh, sure. Lots of people entreat the gods, or propitiate them, or insult them, but does anything happen as a result? They don't. No, they don't. You may call it secular humanism but I call it hubris.The best thing about the movie is Peter O'Toole. He practically gives acting lessons to the leads. Brad Pitt I feel kind of mixed about. He's not bad actually -- humorless, narcissistic, and relentless except when he's in a snit. By the way, didn't Achilles hide in drag among the women in order to avoid being drafted? Maybe not. My memory is a little rusty after all these years. I didn't have a problem with Brad Pitt, the actor, but rather with his role as written and directed. We already know that Achilles is full of love for himself, but must we be too? Pitt is all pumped up and musclebound and the camera gives us more than one shot of his bare behind. That's okay as far as it goes because the Greeks were pretty casual about nudity (""gymnasium"", etc.) but then, well -- why not a bit more of Helen too? Or Briseis? What's the matter with their behinds?Speaking of Briseis, the erstwhile temple virgin with whom Achilles falls in love, brings up a couple of creaky places in the construction of the story. Alright, they don't have to hew too closely to Homer's original. He probably didn't hew very closely either. After all it was an oral tradition and there wasn't too much to hew to. But the introduction of the romance between Achilles and Briseis, which I don't remember being in The Iliad, almost turns the movie into a Harlequin romance punctuated by scenes of battle and intrigue. In fact all the romances are handled through dialog that is positively an embarrassment. Near the beginning Paris sneaks into Helen's room and she says, ""You shouldn't be here."" Paris: ""That's what you said last night."" Helen: ""Last night was a mistake."" I kept waiting for one of the lovers to turn to the other and say, ""We have to talk."" At least the Helen/Paris romance was required. Her sleek Teutonic beauty is what launched those thousand ships. But Achilles and Briseis is off track. It's the story of a man who ""found himself"" through the love of a good woman. (Ho hum.)It turns out, according to this version of the story, that Paris didn't shoot Achilles with an arrow before the walls of Troy after all. Instead Achilles is killed because he foolishly rushes around the burning palace searching for Briseis, his missing love. When Briseis yields to him and agrees to leave, he sweeps her up in his brawny arms and Paris, mistaking this for a coerced abduction, plugs him in the heel. There follow the few last words to his lost love, from a man who died tragically just as he found the true meaning of life. The real Achilles must be begging the boatman to take him back across the Styx so he can strangle the writers.Visually of course the movie is overwhelming. Maybe too much so. We see a horde of about two thousand Greeks in dark armor plodding relentlessly towards Troy, while ominous music throbs in the background. It owes something to the score for Alexander Nevsky, but if you're going to rip somebody off it might as well be Prokoviev. The fact is, there are too many guys. In The Iliad Homer gives us two lines of warriors -- the Greeks and Trojans -- shouting insults and shaking spears at one another until some of them rush out of line to do battle. This puts the spotlight on individual mano a mano combat, like that between Hector and Patroclus. But when you have a myriad of men hacking away at each other, who's to notice, and stop to watch, when two heroes swear off against one another?It's not a bad movie at all. Rarely does one's mind drift. But why did the writers try to hammer that round peg of a romance into the square hole of the narrative itself? Is Brad Pitt such a bustier-melting hunk that someone thought the audience wanted to see his tender side? And his backside as well? Was he so expensive that somebody figured he ought to be given more lines of dialog? And get that stupid helmet off so we can all see how handsome he is? I was reassured to see that the guys I enjoyed and admired most in the original -- the morally upright Hector and the clever, ironic Odysseus -- receive fair treatment here. I never liked Paris much. I always thought of him as a handsome namby-pamby and an idiot to boot. Happily he doesn't get much better play in the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Excellent, Truly Excellent.","Troy is truly one of the best films I have ever seen. The casting is spot-on and the digital effects are a definite rival to the Return of the King.Brad Pitt's portrayal of Achilles was the best I have ever seen, filled with the arrogance and sensitivity contrast that I am looking for in 'The Illiad's Akhileus!Eric Bana's nobility as Hector wiped the floor with any Oscar nominees of the last two years (Sean Penn? what is that? Johnny Depp was well better!!!) and deserves recognition for his finest work yet.Though Orlando Bloom's performance is quite weak in comparison, I believe that his portrayal of Paris really captured the cowardice that is Paris. The slight arrogance of naivety and selfishness that became the doom of Troy.Newcomer to film, Diane Kruger's Helen was, though very restricted, quite emotional. She seemed genuinely afraid of her husband and in love with Paris. Her line ""Every day I was with him, I wanted to walk into the ocean and drown. I don't want a hero. I want someone I can grow old with"" was one of the most emotional for me. However i found her voice incredibly annoying and hard to bare.Achilles' lines are sure to be the most memorable. for example ""You will not have eyes tonight. You will not have ears or a tongue. You will wander the underworld blind, Deaf and dumb and all the dead will know; this is Hector: the fool who thought he killed Achilles."" is a line a believe i will never forget. However it was quite a wooden performance and the accent was less than perfect.Appearances of such greats as Julie Christie as Thetis, Peter O'Toole as Priam and Sean Bean as Oddyseus were, however, by far the best performances and the only flaw is that there was not more to there characters.I love the cast, the action, the drama and the most impressive part was DEFINITELY the Hector/Achilles fight. Though no match to my beloved Lord of the Rings, Troy is definitely ONE OF my favourite movies of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A superficial wannabe epic,"Troy is just a superficial attempt at making a historical epic. Its visually impressive computer generated armies, battalions of ships and cities make it nice to look at , but thats as far as your enjoyment will go with this film (unless your an undemanding female in which case you have the chiseled bodies of brad pitt to look at....).This is a story where characters die , wage war on each other , betray each other and go through all other sorts of drama , but the characters are so unlikeable that all of the potentially powerful plot developments involving them just loose their impact when they occur.You really wont feel that bothered about moments that are supposed to be really tragic or intense.Its not all bad , but its uninvolving story and one dimensional characters ensure that it ain't exactly all good either. And the less said about achillies blonde hair and blue eyes in a racially homogenous ancient Greece , the better....",,Anonymous,History
Well done modern retelling,"I was impressed with this version because it presented the characters as genuine people without the mystical involvement of the ancient Greek gods.Most importantly, Achilles is presented as a superior warrior whose skills and talent prevent him from being defeated. There is nothing of his immortality from being dipped into the river Styx. Pitt portrays an Achilles who is human and questioning his reasons for killing and his role in life.The kings are presented as people driven by greed for power. Human nature is the directing factor, not the gods.The battle scenes are terrific especially the choreography of the sword fighting.I rarely see a film twice in succession. This is one of those times.",9.0,Anonymous,History
So average it hurts,"This film is so average it makes me want to dislike it more than is strictly fair.The actors were almost universally below par, even the likes of Peter O'Toole which is a great shame. For the duration of the film I was hoping that someone would give the ever-infuriating Orlando Bloom the kicking that he so clearly deserved (how on earth has he convinced Hollywood that he can act!?!?!?), Brad Pitt was given some fairly shocking dialogue to deliver and ended up competing with Brian Cox for the most overly-grand performance award. Only Eric Bana and Sean Bean did themselves justice, though surely the woeful script writing team should take most of the blame.The character development was minimal and with such a rich original to work from this is unforgivable. In the first half of the film we are reminded about half a dozen times in the most unsubtle manner that Achilles is in it for the glory. That is his motivation taken care of. Then we learn that Agammemnon is something of a megalomaniac. That takes care of his character.Hector is the all round good guy fighting someone else's war (cut to cute shots of him with his wife and kid). Paris and Helen spend a good five minutes wrestling with the guilt and then figure what the hell, we are young and pretty and can't possibly get our come-uppance in this piece of Hollywood schamltz.Finally there is the dialogue, the biggest weakness of this film. Almost every speech is delivered as if it was the climax of the greatest epic ever made. Imagine every conversation conducted as if it was Russell Crowe in Gladiator revealing himself to the upstart emperor (Pheonix). It is beyond over the top and grates from start to finish.The fight scenes are impressive, especially the showdown between Hector and Achilles, but it is not as if the result is ever in the balance. As for the scale, I only appreciated when watching Troy just how high Lord of the Rings had raised the bar. A valiant effort was found wanting in almost every department as it could just not match the tension, the balance between the individual characters and the overall sweep nor the detail of the Rings films.Perhaps a lesson reveals itself in all this: Tolkien and Homer essentially wrote similar stories involving strong and memorable characters, long time-scales, detailed mythologies and themes of sacrifice and greed etc etc.The LOTR scriptwriters tried to stay a lot more faithful to the strengths of their source while one gets the feeling that with Troy the makers just wanted a summer blockbuster and Homer provided a must on which to hang their budget. What a pity, they have squandered a magnificent opportunity.Still, Helen looked nice...PS A different reviewer seemed to think that a better option would be to see Van Helsing. I could not disagree more, for all its faults Troy is a whole universe better than Van Helsing, which is among the worst pieces of cinema I have ever had the displeasure to endure.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Fulfillment of the main issue,"First two hexameters of Homer`s Iliad are the main point of this heroic-epic story, and this is the Achilles`s ANGER, which is the essential part of his character and his very doom. According to this, as the second hexameter told us, he was the one who put all the host of Achaeans (not Spartans, yet!) in many of the troubles. Homer`s Iliad described just about 20 days of the Troy war, which lasted 10 years, and it was the last year of war (Agamemnon and Odysseus mentioned they`re abiding on the shores before Troy a full 9 years, since they left Peloponeses). Somewhere in the middle of this story we can reveal the cause of this war - Alexandar-Paris took from Menelaus his wife Helena, which shows that she was dwelt in Troy for 9 years, ere all those things happened Homer telling us. The Achaean host actually waited and dwelt before the strong walls of the city of Troy and it`s destroying, for full 10 years (remember that Odysseus was apart from his kingdom on Ithaca for 20 years, 10 in Troy war and 10 in his wanderings - ""Odyssey""). The death of Achilles we can recognize only in Hector`s prophecy words while he was dying, told to Achilles alone, that he will be slain by Paris. Also, Agamemnon (son of Atreus) the king of Mycenae, was nothing else but the first between the equals in that time (bronze age of Aegea), so Achilles had no any obligations or obedience to him, he was free to release his anger and to follow his doom defined by gods. There are only 4 great battles in Iliad, including one-on-one between Hector and Achilles, as the crucial one. Now, Hector, noble too, had completely opposite character, but in the very first of meeting the Achilles he fled before him and after their running around walls of Troy (3 circles they ran) Hector finally decided to confront Achilles. Nevertheless, Hector was the greatest hero of Troy indeed, for he knew Achilles is invulnerable, given to him by Nymphes and gods, but he was farsighted, knowing Paris would shoot the Achilles`s only weak spot, so he excepted his own doom, to be slain by Achilles. All the gods were directly involved in this war, by love, or hate, or by cunning.So, Wolfgang Petersen made a great movie, for the main issue of the Iliad, ACHILLES ANGER, is fulfilled in his excellent deed.Brad Pitt is wonderful Achilles, the right one (Homer ever called Achilles handsome and blond)), so, Brad, I don`t know if you like this roll or not, but you was born to act the Achilles, as Viggo Mortensen was so to act the Aragorn (I don`t want to compare the actors!). Splendid.Eric Bana is so noble and valiant, but full of sorrow and love, care and loyalty. In Iliad Hector was similar. Bravo.Brian Cox, well done, though Agamemnon was a bit more cunning and he gave up Briseis much earlier (she was Achilles slave and lover before Agamemnon took her from Achilles, the reason for the one of the first arguing of these two men, and the cause of all the further troubles in the last year of war).Orlando Bloom is no one else, but Paris, young, a bit spoiled, but his courage grows as the time passes during war, his love for Helena as well. Orlando`s acting satisfied the Paris`s character, the intact mimics of his face, especially.Sean Bean as Odysseus is brilliant, acting wise but cunning man, opened to the others, but hidden in his minds, as Odysseus was indeed.Now, there are some unclear things. First is that Ajax (the Big Ajax, there are two with the same name in Iliad)is in the battle changed with Diomed, it`s confusing one person with another. Second confusion, more exactly of the rolls in movie, considers Briseis. She was Achilles`s lover, the war ""trophy"" from the city of Lyrnes (Lirnes), long before Troy war and she never was one of the virgins of Apollo`s shrine near Troy, but it was Kasandra, Priam`s daughter, sister of Hector and Paris, who was farsighted (a gift to her from Apollo alone) and she was the very person who foretell all the troubles in Troy and the final destroying of the city and Priam`s realm, forever. In a movie it is a big mistake. Where is Kasandra, anyway?Yet, I voted 10, for this movie by itself is the great one, perfect done. All the details (costumes, tools and weapons, ships etc.) are very convenient. Excavations of built levels of Troy shows that the levels VI or VIIa might be the Priam`s realm, so the costumes and tools I mentioned are well reconstructed, considering the artifacts from those levels, also they`re of the same kind with those in Agamemnon`s Mycaena, from the same period.Congratulations!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Disappointing,"This film is not actually poor. However, with the huge publicity surrounding it, i really wanted it to be better than it was.The cinematography was awesome, the score was subtle, the story itself is compelling but the problem was that it lost something in its delivery. In actual fact, it got a little bit boring about an hour and a half in to the film which is neve good when you are only half way through!! There were moments of excellence, for example the results of Achille's cousin's battle, the revealing of the Trojan Horse (breathtakingly accurate) and the battle scenes..well though they seemed to be all very similar, they were stunningly choreographed.Petter O'Toole proved that he is one of the greatest actors around as the King of Troy and Eric Bana was a revelation in his post-Hulk role as his son, Prince Hector. Saffron Burrows, usually not the best actress of her generation, pulled off a smaller role with adeptness and Brad Pitt was of course..well..Brad Pitt (average acting-wise yet physically commanding when on screen).BUt then you get to Orlando Bloom and Diane Krueger...Neither of the pair is a bad actor but the chemistry between them is so lacking that it almost had me shouting at the screen. I also found it hard to come to grips with the relationship between Hector and PAris's cousin and Achilles, her captor. I know that in such circumstances, hostages can become attracted to their keeper, yet the fact that he was an arch enemy who was killing her family and friends off with one blow of his mighty sword just seemed a little off the mark..However, i suppose this is all based on teh story that has existed for years so it cannot be changed. And if i caught a glimpse of Pitt's body sweaty and naked, i would hardly turn him away - women will get a glimpse through the eyes of Jennifer ANiston!SO, yes - a remarkable story. Nicely executed with some bravura performances but on the negative side a little bit slow and poor casting of two of the pivotal central roles leads to a disappointment if you were expecting 100% excellence throughout.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Interesting political parable,"When I was a Film Major, I groaned inside whenever my classmates attempted to instill political themes into whatever movie was up for discussion. Well, sometimes they could be right. TROY is definitely a movie with a contemporary political subtext.Growing up I used to read Greek mythology.  I grew up believing the Greeks were the good guys, out to rescue the fair Helen from the nefarious Trojans. I also grew up believing that America was always the good guys in any conflict.  The invasions of Grenada, Panama, and Iraq sure dispelled that belief, both for me and for a lot of the world.Watching the movie it struck me fairly quickly that the Greek invaders were symbolizing the US invasion of Iraq.  Agamemnon is clearly George Bush Junior, seizing the convenient excuse of Helen's abduction as rationale for the invasion he wants more than anything.  Odysseus seems to be Powell, the only one of the Greek kings with any integrity or real intelligence.  When Odysseus protests the men still believe the war is being fought to help Menelaeus rescue Helen, Agamemnon coldly replies that the invasion was never about Helen.  One can easily imagine Powell being similarly rebuffed by Bush Junior.  Agamemnon is obsessed with destroying Troy as a means to increase his power.Notice how Agamemnon is always accompanied by his two vassal kings, analogous to how Bush Junior rarely acts without Rumsfeld or Cheney.Achilles then comes to represent the American Fighting Man.  He is the one who actually fights, who actually faces danger.  But Agamemnon, like Bush, sits back in safety and gathers the glory for himself.  When Achilles points out that Agamemnon had done none of the fighting he claims credit for, Agamemnon merely gloats. Achilles is more than willing to commit atrocities but he is also capable of noble acts.Agamemnon, like Bush Junior, denounces any attempt at negotiation.  The one time he does pretend to negotiate, when Paris challenges Menelaeus, Agamemnon intends to break the pact.  Again, consider how we now know that Bush had no interest in any negotiation or cooperation with Iraq.The Trojans have strong religious beliefs.  The Greeks, on the other hand, give lip service to the gods and happily desecrate temples to gods they ostensibly worship.Note that Helen soon moves into the background, almost disappearing from the story of a war that should center on her.  Likewise, Osama bin Laden, the reason for the twin invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, is rarely mentioned.Is the film anti-American?  In some aspects it can be seen thus.  After all, even when the Greeks know there is no longer any possibility of reuniting Menelaeus with Helen, they continue their onslaught.  Likewise, even after the world knew that Iraq had no connection to 9/11 and that there were no Iraqi ""weapons of mass destruction"" the US continued their invasion.  The film is clearly even more anti-Bush in the form of the homicidal demagogue Agamemnon.  That Greek king thought nothing of killing his own daughter to get his fleet underway.  Has anyone seen Bush exhibit any real regret at the 700+ American soldiers already killed in his trumped-up war?Bravo to Wolfgang Petersen and David Beniof for speaking truths that are increasingly hard to say in America.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Two Thumbs Up,"In my eyes, the action in Troy works. The one-on-one fights in the movie are well-filmed and nicely choreographed. The casting is perfect. Troy rocks and, if not for some lengthy moments, could have found its own place among other epics, such as Spartacus or Braveheart.Prince of Troy runs off with Greek ruler's wife. This is just the sort of excuse Greece needs to send its entire army, with brooding champion hero Achilles in tow, to wipe out the Trojans.The best moment in Troy is when the King, played by Peter O' Toole pleads to Achilles to return his son. Our screenwriter has made the heroes as human as possible, and lets the audience decide whom to pass judgment on. Aside from the unnecessary armies expected in a movie such as the Rings' Return of the King, Troy is a very deep movie, that creates its own myth, or tragedy, if you will.",7.0,Anonymous,History
What about menhirs?,"I really can't cope. From an antiquary and archaeological point of view,""Troy"" is the only serious film about ancient Greece I have ever seen. Nevertheless, a lot of silly things have been said and written about it. Why? Because the gods are excluded from the action? There are lots of ancient and modern retellings of the story which exclude the gods. Or because Hector shows scepticism about the ""winged messages"" alleged by Trojan priests? But this is Homer (Iliad, book 12). Religion, temples and sanctuaries in ancient Greek epics are a very difficult and delicate matter. The movie treats this subject with intelligence and information. In the Mycenean era, the temples were usually annexed to the royal palaces, and this is very well shown in ""Troy"". But Homer (and later epics) tell about independent sanctuaries, such as the one of Athena (Ilias, book 6), which is probably an anachronism, just like the temple of Apollo Tymbraeus, sacked by Achilles out of the walls of Troy (Cyprian tales, Apollodorus and so on). The Greek religious architecture begins in the VIII-VII centuries b.C.: the movie tries to reconstruct a temple belonging to that time, with reference to insular and ""Orientalizing"" evidence (Gortina, Prinias). But the most intolerable mistake I read in some reviews concerns the building where Achilles trains with Patroclus. The movie was located in Malta and Mexico...so, please, remember that there are NO Greek temples in Malta or in Mexico. The structure is a MENHIR, placed in Malta, and dating back to the third millennium b.C. There were menhirs also in Greece, and obviously we can suppose they were ruined when the Trojan war was beginning. It is possible that Achilles trained in the ruins of a menhir, and in any case the idea is very suggestive.",10.0,Anonymous,History
george bush and the Trojan war,"i wonder how many people thought of the comparison between geo.w bush and the Mycenaean king, Agamemnon. I realize the packaging is more refined today but the goals seem very similar. Bush wants to Americanize the world. He is the tool of all the kings of business that seek a new world order. The hubris here is on such a primitive level. I would have hoped we would have learned more about respect and peace in the past 2,255 years. Iam glad I viewed the movie. Brad Pitt made a good Achilles. He reminded me a bit of Kirk Douglas or Victor Mature. I kept comparing this movie to Helen of Troy, one of the first movies my dad took me to see. I think that was 1955 or so. With the advent of computer technology the grandeur of the Greek fleet was really impressive.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Bookworms - Give it a rest already...,"I need to make something clear to the literati here. For what it's worth, a lot of us have read the Illiad and heck, many even enjoyed it. But - and here's the kicker - THIS IS A MOVIE. A MOVIE. I have every suspicion that portraying the events as they 'actually happened' would make a fine MINISERIES. But of necessity for the medium, they chopped up your beloved epic. And if we *really* wanted to get down to it, the events you so desperately seek aren't found only in the Illiad either. Get over it. To the question of whether this is a great movie - no, it's not a great movie. But it isn't a 'bad' movie either. The central characters are portrayed as they needed to be - flawed and invariably compromised by their actions. Nobody's acting to eat the scenery; things are played in a rather straightforward manner. I respected the effort put into the movie and mostly the fact that the ""Bradster"" wasn't allowed to run away with things... which the studio would have loved. Yes, the movie has flaws, but it is neither a disaster nor an classic. This movie won't be fondly remembered. But it ought not be completely dismissed either. It warrants a 6-7 out of 10 simply for being able to keep people attentive to the goings on (please oh wise literati, show us *your* even moderately coherent script comprising dozens of characters) and maintaining at least a semblance to the material. If it gets someone turned on to the old Homie's epic (epics actually - The Odyssey and the Illiad), then I say good on ya Wolfgang. I'll also point out that the studio that produced Lord of the Rings *guaranteed* 3 movies. Wolfie and his crew got 1. This is a good effort at making a mainstream movie from exceptionally difficult material. And besides, even Herodotus was skeptical about the stories he heard. So give it a rest, bookworms.

"7/10 Excellent acting, respectable dialog, terrific artistic presentation, bad direction, bad soundtrack, lacks momentum.","THE GOOD: The acting was as good as I would expect from anyone. The characters were presented in a consistent way. The script was good, definitely held a few nice touches and avoided a few auto-complete phrases. The action, generally, was done well.THE BAD: The soundtrack was annoying. Bah. Tried to be 'epic'. It was botched. The directing... This movie has no momentum. Just when you start to care what's going on, just when something interesting is happening or is being said, something mundane and pointless follows and you're back to zero. There was way too much time spent looking at ordinary things happening, large groups of people moving around, or pan shots of scenery. We all know that ordinary things happen and that large groups of people must move around. Normally this would be ok, except that such things killed the momentum of the movie and wasted precious screen time.SUMMARY: Generally I liked the movie for what it was, and I'm very very glad that the actors did a great job with a fair script; they saved the picture. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,History

Troy triumphs as expected.,"I must say that despite the negative reviews I've read about this movie before I saw it, I was actually impressed by it.  Ever since I saw the first trailer to this movie, back when ""The Matrix Revolutions"" was released, I was anticipating the release.  This movie, plus ""The Passion of the Christ"" were two of the biggest movies I've anticipated watching for the 2004 movie season, and just like ""Passion,"" I was satisfied with ""Troy.""Brad Pitt, who is Achilles, starts the movie off with his swordplay, as well as his arrogance.  But that was the man Achilles was.  Pitt puts Achilles in a good perspective as to the man he was in the Greek ages.  Pitt also keeps the movie going into its climaxes and other points.But Pitt isn't quite the heart of the movie, Hector, played by Eric Bana, is.  He is a good man who loves his city of Troy, in which he holds the crown of the Prince of Troy.  He devotes his honor for Troy and his father Priam, played by the great Peter O'Toole.  Hector knew that there will be a time in which Troy would need his protection and honor, but it wouldn't have come so soon if it hadn't been for his brother Paris, played by Orlando Bloom.I must say that Bloom is a good actor, but I, along with many others who have seen this movie, don't like his character.  I understand that Paris was very naive and cowardly, but then again, I thought Orlando Bloom was right in playing a role in which he wasn't the brave man he portrayed in ""The Lord of the Rings"" saga, and in ""Pirates of the Caribbean.""  But he isn't the main flaw of this movie.I have learned about Ancient Greek mythology way before seeing this movie, and I will only complain that most things in this film were completely inaccurate.  I'm not going to spoil things for everyone, but I will only say that if Homer were still alive, he would complain on how his poem, ""The Iliad,"" would have only been half the inspiration for this film.  Because that's about how much ""Troy"" had presented itself from the poem.But the inaccuracy isn't enough to label ""Troy"" a bad movie, because it's not.  I still recommend this film to everybody.

the author haven't read Homer,"The movie is full of mistakes:1)  at the time of the war of Troy there was not cavalry because horses where not mounted at the time;2)The armors, the helmets and the shields where different as those described by Homerus and in use about in the 1250 b.c.;3)First man reaching the shore at Troy was Iolao ( then the army changed his name in ""Protesilao"" meaning ""first among the people"")saving the Achilles' life on behalf of a prediction about the death of the first man landing at Troy;4) There is a big confusion beetween the ages, Myceneians, Greeks, Hellenic age and so on;5) Buildings, costructions and temples are not of the age.The movie is a real disappointement to those that loves the poems of Homerus even the feeling of the epic era was wrong!

"Oh boy, it's Troy","This film is too long, plain and simple. I know they were going for that good old-fashioned epic feel, but let's face it, these guys aint exactly Cecil B. DeMille and Company.   I still give it a 6, which is my imdb equivalent of ***, because Pitt's good, the girl who plays Helen is sufficiently beautiful, and Brian Cox and Peter O'Toole raise the bar every time they appear.  Plus there's a certain other-worldliness to the proceedings, even if it's not of C.B. DeMille caliber.  But my first statement still holds:  lop off at least 30 minutes of troops-running-toward-each-other scenes and we would find a far more engrossing film lying underneath the spoils.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Fantastic! Amazing! Stunning!,"I don't know what everyone is going on about!!!! When I go on this website all that I see are people saying how bad the movie was, but I saw it and thought that it was great!!! Fantastic!! Sure, they don't stick to the Iliad exactly, but Lord of the Rings didn't stick to the books exactly, and you don't see many people complaining! This review is just to let everyone out there know that this film is fantastic! The battle scenes are amazing, the 1000 ships at sea are stunning and the actors do a great job. Eric Bana is probably the stand out performance as Hector, but, like I said before, they all do a great job. When they hear how long this film is, many people groan, but the 2hrs 50mins flys by as you are taken into this amazing film. It is an adventure for the men, romance for the women, and sad for anyone who likes to cry (I went with a friend of mine and she cried 4 times). 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
Awesome movie - who cares that it's not in line with Homer!,"I am always disappointed when people judge a movie on whether or not it is historically correct. Unless that was the intention of the producers.... WHO CARES!! Troy was an amazing movie. I have a Master's degree in ancient history and I have read Homer's work numerous times. I don't really care that the movie differs because I think they did a great job on it. There are certain things they had to alter in order to make the movie more entertaining to the average viewer. If they hadn't, history buffs would have been the only one's satisfied.The battle scenes are spectacular, especially the moves they were able to give Achilles. And on that note, Brad Pitt did a great job of portraying him. The only problem i have with this movie is Orlando Blooms performance. Although Paris was supposed to be a coward, I think Orlando was too much of a baby and overdid it a little. Sometimes it made me a little sick.Anyway, these comments people are making remind me of when Gladiator came out. It was a wicked movie but obviously historically incorrect. It wasn't until the movie won some awards that people started to back off.So lay off of Troy. It's a great movie. I loved it and own the DVD. Being historically incorrect is not a reason to judge it since that was never a goal of the producers... they were just out to make an entertaining flick, and they did a tremendous job of that.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Wonderfully acted, poorly directed film","I have to say this was a wonderful film and does a pretty faithful depiction of the original text. (the few times it strays are plot motivated, and work well) Brad Pitt turns in a top notch performance, as does Eric Bana. Sean Beam and Brian Cox consistently provide terrific performances as well. Peter O' Toole also gives an incredible performance and one of the best portrayals of a king I have ever seen. The major disappointment I have is the terrible job the director of photography did in this movie. Not just are many of his shots unmotivated, but some are just downright awkward and even hurt the feel of the film. I have certainly heard of the Dir. of Photography having a hand in the success of a film, but this is the first time I have seen one hurt a picture. I also question the directing in general; anybody can make a great epic from such a great text, and David Benioff wrote a terrific screenplay. It seems that Wolfgang Peterson might've had his work cut out for him, especially with such a strong cast. The auteuring here relies upon the story and the actors who portray it, and that maybe works for the better.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Amazing Movie....Must See,"This film is wonderful....the setting and tone are perfect even if at times it can be a little predictable. the action is very good and has a nice authentic feel, much better than the dreariness of a similar genre movie like say ""king author"" which was everything this film avoided, e.g. wooden acting and lack of captivating plot. Troy is captivating in many senses as it realistically shows war as having heroes on both sides and in this case no clear bad guys.... of course there are bad guys in it but neither side is really portrayed as the goodies or the baddies which makes for an interesting spin on a war film. Watch this film asap if you haven't had the pleasure already, it really shows that films of the older type (Jason of the Arganourts and Clash of the Titens) really should be remade with the advanced CGI because a realistic film of the era works.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"""Any similarities between the film and the Iliad are purely coincidental""","For those who don't know the story from the Iliad, they still won't if they watch this film. With the exception of Peter O'Toole, acting is at a premium. That's not as much a criticism of the cast as the ludicrous script they had to deal with, but Brad Pitt's performance is a caricature, not a character. The Iliad revolved around one romance, but Hollywood, which always thinks more is better, contrived two more. CGI helps, especially to convey the large scale, but it's still not as impressive as the real life action staged in various films made before CGI existed, such as ""Spartacus"". The Iliad was written 9-10 centuries ago, but people still remember it. This film was made a little over two decades ago -- most people no longer remember it, and many more wish that they didn't.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Heroes and the Ancient World,"Achilles was known as the immortal created by the waters of the river Styx. His heroic story reverberates across the centuries and is illuminated by the film entitled TROY. Director Wolfgang Petersen draws well on his extensive talent and has created an enormous masterpiece for audiences for years to come. Combining the enormous talents of such notables as Peter O'Toole, Eric Bana, Brian Cox, and Orlando Bloom the setting awakens with a true panorama of both spectacle and historical value. The few flaws wound within the beautiful tapestry of the film are only apparent to those who have any knowledge of the works of Homer or studied classic antiquity. The most obvious is the absence of the intimate relationship between Achilles and his lover Patroclus. Also noticeable is the Spartan soldiers allowing women at their feast instead of their traditional partners. Other minor flaws consist of squeezing the ten year siege war into the space of two hours and of course, for the more aesthetic among us, the unattractive ""Trojan Horse."" Nonetheless, the spectacular, panoramic fight scenes are impressive and magnificent. A classic film if ever there was one. ****",9.0,Anonymous,History
"May be not that good, but very entertaining","'Troy' is based on Homer's 'The Illiad' but has changed the story from a Greek myth to a Hollywood epic tale. That is not a good thing, but it definitely gives us entertaining results. This Hollywood version shows us the Trojan War a little simplified. The reason of this war between the Greek king Agamemnon (Brian Cox) and the Trojan king Priam (Peter O'Toole) is Helen (Diane Kruger). Trojan prince Paris (Orlando Bloom) has taken her from Agamemnon's brother Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson) and Agamemnon sees this as the perfect opportunity to conquer Troy. The Greek have Achilles (Brad Pitt) and the only man Achilles is able to respect, Odysseus (Sean Bean). The Trojans have prince Hector (Eric Bana). Both Achilles and Hector belong to the greatest heroes from the Greek stories.How the story unfolds I will not reveal although the trick with the Trojan Horse is probably familiar with most people. Like I said the movie is not that good, especially on certain levels, and for some that makes sure they will not like the movie. It is true that computer generated armies are not that impressive anymore, it is true that people here talk as they are in a Hollywood romantic comedy, it is true that Brad Pitt, a fine actor, is very miscast as Achilles, it is true that the war doesn't seem to take ten years, it is true that Diane Kruger doesn't make her Helen worth fighting for and it is true that the movie sometimes has its focus on the wrong things.That said, let me focus on the good things. May be the great battles are not that good, although they are entertaining enough, but I have to admit that the inevitable fight between Achilles and Hector is one of the best I have seen. The movie knows that we are not supposed to have a favorite and therefore the sequence is even more exciting. Other action sequences are at least spectacular. There is a fight between Paris and Menelaos who wants his vengeance and the movie makes the right choices in how to shows this sequence.Pitt, Bloom and Kruger are not very good, or at least miscast. True, but Bana and especially Gleeson, Cox and O'Toole are terrific in their roles. O'Toole is mentioned as very positive not for the first time for his performance in 'Troy', his scenes are the best on the emotional level. Most other things are not very good on the emotional level. The cinematography is not bad although it uses the same trick over and over again. The camera starts with a low shot and then it lifts to show how grand and great it all looks. Admittedly, it looks great. Its production design, costumes, visual effects and score from James Horner are close to flawless.Considering all the above you can understand that 'Troy' is a movie with many flaws, some on pretty important levels. I realize that, but if the flaws are not that distracting and the entertainment is as good as in 'Troy' I don't want to complain too much.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Beware of Hollywood bearing Greek skits.,"I read in some of the reviews, within this site, of how historically balanced and/or accurate Troy is. In what alternate reality or universe would that be in? This movie is historically and geographically inaccurate from the get go. If you visit Sparta and then visit the ancient areas of Menelaos or Agamemnon, you will realize that the nearest beach is about 30 miles away, not port cities as the opening of the movie portrays. Second, if you should read the Iliad you would see that: A) Menelaos does not die, but in fact is reunited with Helen and both go back to Sparta. B) There were two characters named Ajax, and they did not die on the beach. C) The war lasted 10 years, not a few weeks as portrayed in the movie. D) Achilles and Petrocles were lovers, not cousins.I could go on, but what is the use. Hollywood did it once again, deciding to take what is already a great epic, with great characters and great plots and twist them into a mindless spectacle (as they Did with ""Alexander"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven"").I also find it old and irritating that the same character actors who portray Barbarians, or other medieval warriors, are here portraying Greeks. Are there not enough actors, or make up artists, to make actors look and sound like the characters they are supposed to be portraying? Must English (or for that matter, Irish or American) actors sound English? Even on the shores of Troy and in the palaces of Peloponneso?If you read any review that tells you this movie is in any way faithful or close to or has only slight variances to the real Iliad, please inform them to either take a Western Humanities I college course, or to pick up a copy of the Iliad and read it before they go on to make such blatantly incredible statements.The irony is, that the director could have stuck with the original poem as story line, and it would have been more interesting in suspense, character development, drama and alike, than the movie they made.But why do that, the Iliad has only been around for approximately 2800 years, where as Hollywood has been around for approximately 100 years. Of course the latter would know better what the former was trying to articulate and do it so much better.As far as the acting, Pitt and Bana are excellent, and the movie oscillates in drama and action between these two. Bloom does not convince me of anything in the movie, let alone a Lover and stealer of other men's' women. This is where the idea of Helen, being given to him as a prize for naming a most beautiful Goddess, would come in handy, for Bloom does not have what it takes to steal another man's wife. His best acting came when he had to portray the real Paris, as sniveling, kneeling coward begging for his life. Peter O'Toole is a great actor, one of my favorites, but this movie was not for him.Final assessment: some great acting by a few, the cut and paste warriors is old, the scenery is magnificent, the history is laughable, and finally, when will Hollywood even attempt to get something right?",3.0,Anonymous,History
"If all you want is spectacle then this will just about do you  but it is dull, emotionless spectacle","King Agamemnon sweeps across the land with his mighty army and his supposedly invincible warrior Achilles at the front. Meanwhile one his subject is brokering peace with the princes of Troy  Hector and Paris. When Paris steals the beautiful Helen from Menelas and takes her to Troy it sparks a battle and gives Agamemnon the chance to seize Troy. Inside the city walls of Troy the defences are build and the walls relied on to withstand the attack as they have so often, while on the beaches the mighty army of Agamemnon land and prepare for a long and bloody battle.Let us not forget that this film is a summer blockbuster and, as such, the important thing is spectacle and noisy effects rather than anything else  it's a sad fact but it is a fact. If this is what you want from the film then it has plenty of action, plenty of big bronzed men with swords, heroic deaths and big set pieces. If this is all you want then you are very easy to please and I salute you for that  I wanted more than just action and unfortunately I found Troy to be devoid of anything else of value. In terms of action and effects it all looks good and is technically impressive but the problem with the action, nay the whole film, is that it has zero emotional involvement to draw you in. I could barely care less who lives or dies, who wins or loses because these were not people  they were just big, larger than life blocks  the gods may have been removed from the story but they have been replaced by Petersen who views these characters as his playthings instead!I won't get into petty squabbles over the changes to the source material (I'm reviewing the film in itself) but it did seem to me that the loss of the gods is part of the problem. With the gods' meddling, all the fighting is their fault and we would have felt for the characters  they had no choice. Without the gods the whole war is silly and pointless, based on the silly crush of a boy on a woman who is known for her beauty more than her character (a beauty that will fade). For this reason I never felt for any of them because I wasn't sure who I was rooting for  I was against them all and only wanted it all to be over. But hang on Bob  aren't you missing the point? Well, maybe. I thought that myself  this is a sort of anti-war film after all so maybe the pointlessness of the whole affair is the message the film is delivering? Maybe, but I doubt it. The film tries to be anti-war by having several speeches about the futility of it all and how it never ends but then at the same time it revels in the battle scenes, the heroic deaths, the honour of the men and the roar of battle. It wants to have it's cake and eat it too but in the end all it does is undermine itself in both regards. The situation is silly and pointless and the film knows it  indeed it tries to move way from the battle for Helen as quickly as it can and make it a bigger thing  but it fails, the foundation is weak and never engaged me and attempts to draw me in later were poor. All the story manages to do is to slow the film way down between the battles  it gets the point where I found the film painfully dull and it all was full of it's own self-importance without having anything to actually back up this claim.The cast is deep in names and faces but very few actually have anything to do  like I said, these are not characters; just blocks to be moved like toy soldiers. Pitt is, well, Brad Pitt. He is very sexy, he looks pretty, he moves well and his body is well sculpted: if that is all you want then that is what he delivers. What he doesn't do is deliver a character or a performance. He plays his hero like an arrogant, petulant child and his woeful attempts to give him a personality or emotion in the final stages of the film are just that  woeful. As a blockbuster star he is OK and does what he normally does, but let us never think for a minute that he is an actor. Bloom shows the same acting ability that he did in LOTR, ie none. He is weedy and needy as a character and it needed a talented actor to deliver this, Bloom can't do it. Bana is a good actor (see Chopper) and he has a good presence here even if his material is weak  for my money he was the star of the film and he outshone Pitt. Kruger is beautiful no doubt but she brings nothing else to the table. Cox is good because he not only seems to be enjoying himself but also is sending the whole film up! He is not a kingly king, he is a modern one and his performance comes close to taking the p*ss. The rest of the cast features a large number of faces that add class even if they have no material to really do anything with  Gleeson, Bean, O'Toole and the ever-reliable James Cosmo.Overall this film looks great and will provide spectacle if that's all you want  but be warned that it cannot sustain it's running time and it gets very dull between all the noisy effect shots. The story is dull and lacking in any sort of emotional involvement  a fact that makes it duller and takes away from the impact of the action scenes. This is expensive and a big noisy film but it is so deeply flawed and pointless that I found it hard to get through. I'll leave others to debate the issues over the source material, all I cared about was if it was an enjoyable summer film or not  it isn't.",,Anonymous,History
Enjoyable even if inaccurate,"At the risk of running against what I've read in most of the critics reviews, I liked this film.This movie was anything but historically or archaeologically accurate. Still, it's about what one can expect from a Hollywood epic in this day and age, and an epic it most surely is. From the special effects of the 1,000 ships stretching from horizon to horizon, to the massed fight scenes encompassing hundreds of suitably garbed warriors, this flick rivals Ben Hur and then some. Surprise, surprise, the acting isn't half bad either. Forget about historical accuracy for 160 minutes of thereabouts and immerse yourself into an age of humanity when barbarism and honour stood side by side, ankle deep in fresh gore. When the ability to fight and die for your city-state overrode any other considerations, even unto the death of your nearest and dearest. An age when every man could be, and probably was, a king for a day, or at least a few years, over his own patch of the Mediterranean.I think I enjoyed 'Troy' primarily because of the character portrayals, which were - different. Achilles, played by Brad Pitt, and extremely well played I thought, wasn't the overall ruthless fighter he's been made out to be by Homer. Oh, sure, he could fight, and until he was killed, he always won, but in Pitt's portrayal Achilles he was something less than the ultimate killing machine. Achilles was a troubled individual, seeking an end he knew was coming, and seemingly demanding it to show itself as he expected any other enemy to do. Son of a Goddess and a mortal man, I gathered he was more than a little angry that he turned out to be not quite immortal after all. Arrogance, seething anger, troubled psyche, tenderness and a searching desire were encompassed in Pitt's character and artfully so.Helen of Troy, nee Sparta, played by Diane Kruger, was a fairly meaningless part for the young lady, but she does have the primary attribute for the character, that of a flawless complexion and a stunningly illustrated beauty, no doubt enhanced for the cameras, but stunning just the same. Her few real 'meaty' parts of the script were well carried, and I congratulate her for what must have been a deceptively difficult role.Eric Bana, that son of an Aussie soddy, performed brilliantly as Hektor of Troy. His bearing and demeanour as Crown Prince of Troy was the most convincing I've seen him play yet, even down to his death at the hands of Brad Pitt. Every centimetre Trojan royalty, every centimetre the honourable human being. Good guys usually finish last, but he was dead well before the two hour mark.Orlando Bloom as Paris, younger brother of Hektor presented the love-struck sibling to a tee. His youthful innocence and fresh-faced looks completed the picture extremely well. His incompetence and fear on the field of single combat before Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson), the cuckolded husband of Helen, King Of Sparta and brother of the movie's villain, Agamemnon (Brian Cox) was well done, giving me the feelings of both disgust and disappointment at his failing and fear for his ultimate death. Of course, it doesn't happen there, with the story taking a twist which leads into the over-sized wooden equine saga, and from there into the eventual sacking of Troy by the massed Greek forces of Agamemnon and Odessyus (Sean Bean - most recently as Boromir of LOTR fame), with Achilles blundering through the death and destruction, seeking his own love and ultimately, the end he knew he was seeking but couldn't pin down.The only part of the movie I can honestly say I didn't like was the death of Achilles, ironically at the hands of Paris. I won't spoil the surprise for those of you who haven't seen the flick, but when the demise of Achilles comes, you'll know what I mean as the camera draws back from the supine form of Pitt, lying in death. I've been told of the reasons behind the term, 'Achilles Heel' but if you follow the 'Iliad' and the legends surrounding the death of Achilles, you'll understand just how banal the scene is. All said and done, the film is a portrayal of the human factor at its most base, running off the twin elements which encompass both the soaring future and ultimate degradation of the species - Love and Honour.The detriments aside and no movie is perfect, I'm still going to recommend this film as a solid 7 out of 10. It's an epic, it's a spectacle and above all, it's a story and a damn good one.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Better than I expected.,"When I heard that Hollywood was making an epic movie based on Homer that would star Brad Pitt and Eric Bana, I thought to myself: ""NO WAY! IT WON'T WORK!"" Subsequently I watched the movie and was pleasantly surprised. The movie ""worked""; both Mr. Pitt and and Mr. Bana were quite good and the story, although greatly condensed, was still credible and watchable. In fact, this movie restored my faith in Hollywood's ability to make an epic movie that's more than just a tedious exercise in special effects. For although ""Troy"" is loaded with special effects, it actually tells a story. Yes ... TELLS A STORY! So if you want to watch an epic movie with good acting and which actually tells a story, then watch this movie. By the way, this movie is also one of the great anti-war movies, and if you know the story of Helen of Troy, you will know what I mean.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Not exactly Ben-Hur or Spartacus, but still enjoyable","No gods (with the exception of Julie Christie's cameo as Achilles'mother).Delayed or anticipated deaths.Mr ""Nice Guy"" Brad Pitt(with a British accent)playing brutal warrior Achilles.These are some of the reasons Troy was hated by Greek mythology purists, and I have to admit, being something of a purist myself, that the absence of the various gods annoyed me(I think Michael Douglas would have been good as Zeus,while Hugh Jackman could have been a decent Ares,god of war). As for the other things, since a few characters are more boring or rotten than in the Iliad, changing their demise time isn't that shocking.And Brad Pitt?Well, accent aside, he's actually enjoyable as the half-divine killer.The same can't be said for Diane Kruger and Orlando Bloom, whose forbidden love fuels the Trojan war in the first place.They're a handsome couple, that's true, but their acting makes the romance so insipid.But who cares?We're here to watch the bloody battles.Well, not that bloody, actually:the final duel between Achilles and Hector, which was the most graphic part of the Iliad, is reduced to five bloodless minutes.As for the rest of the cast, the only ones who are really satisfying turn out to be two Trojans(weird, considering we're supposed to hate them),Eric Bana and Peter O'Toole,playing Hector and his father Priam, as well as one Greek, Odysseus, portrayed by Sean Bean(for once he's a good guy).It may not be entirely faithful to the source material(the audience will prefer the Trojans), but if you ignore the flaws, you can enjoy Troy for what it is: a visually impressive, decently acted, Hollywood-style epic.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"""Troy"" is one film worth watching.","To start this off, I'd just like for everyone to keep in mind that I started watching this movie at eleven o' clock at night on HBO, despite the fact that both my parents had said it was absolutely horrendous.I have ADD, and thus was confident that if my mother couldn't sit through it, I probably wouldn't be able to. But, of course, I tried it anyway, having heard both excellent and terrible reviews of it.Holy crap, what a movie.I enjoyed nearly all of the film, and not just because of all the extremely beautiful man flesh that was being tossed around. Although that was a plus, the story was so huge and epic I couldn't help but fall madly in love with it.I have heard people whine about it be historically inaccurate, to which I say this: It's the Trojan War, people. Were you there for the Trojan War? Do you know what happened? And, more importantly, do you really think that Homer was only writing history? The man took some artistic license, and if you haven't figured that out by now, you are a complete fool.But enough bickering, onto the facts. I found most of the acting to be outstanding, especially Eric Bana's performance as Hector. Upon seeing him in that god-awful letdown, ""The Hulk,"" I wanted to see him redeem himself. He did an astonishing job here. He made Hector come to life with such humanity and such grace. Thank you, Eric.Brad Pitt was halfway decent as well as the super-beautiful demigod Achilles. Of course, he barely attempted an accent, which sort of made his character seem less real. But I think he made up for it in the long run. Achilles is one tough character to portray. His inner struggle is something only the best can pull off, and since he did ""Fight Club,"" I have considered Brad Pitt to be one of the best. He was melodramatic, but not so much in a way where he took away from the story. I applaud him.Orlando Bloom as Paris and Diane Kruger as Helen were the weak links in the chain. Sure, Orlie's almost as pretty as Diane, who is absolutely gorgeous. But Paris came off as a cowardly little naive girl, and Helen...I don't know what to say about her. I just didn't CARE about Helen. Kruger failed to give her the personality needed to support a character of that magnitude.Everyone else was rather good, and I loved seeing Sean Bean in there. He is such a fox. Peter O' Toole was lovely as well, and the various ladies scattered about the film were very good.All in all, this was a movie that kept me interested from beginning to end. I fought serious fatigue to get through it, but in the end, it was well worth while.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Pretty good,"Not quite as good as I expected it to be but definetely worth seeing. However I've never been a big Brad Pitt fan and this film done nothing to change my opinion of him. I suppose his female fans would have enjoyed his performance though as he spends most of film with little clothes on, being male I found the massive battle scenes more appealing and they WERE massive and superbly shot. Eric Bana was really good and stole the picture and Orlando Bloom was as usual completely awful. Wolfgang Petersen is a great director and he does a fine job here, I give it 7/10, if you hasn't seen it and want some Summer thrills wait until it comes out on DVD and see the much more entertaining The Day After Tomorrow or Van Helsing instead.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Not perfect, but great enough to be truly epic","This movie is an epic adaptation of the ancient poem ""The Iliad"" by Homer. The producers changed the story about a bit (eg. the relationships of the characters) and changed the time span of the war from 10 years to a mere 16 days or so. But the end result is a fabulous movie to watch. Although the special effects are not really what I consider ""one of the world's greatest"", the camera direction is one of the best I have seen and the sound effect is entrancing. Wolfgang Petersen has carved himself a real reputation from directing this movie.I will not call the overall sets and costumes colorful, as they are all mostly earth-tone colors. But they do fit in very well with the movie. The costume designs are really not bad. The costumes for the Greeks are plain, simple, nothing we have not seen before. But the costumes for the Trojans are something. Very original. Something different from the other ancient Greek or that type of genre movies.Let us not forget the cast. I have watched many movies, and of all I will have to say that TROY has the best cast of all. The actors ARE the characters the play. I highly doubt that another set of cast would be able to bring these legendary characters to life like Brad Pitt and gang did.The war scenes and combat are extremely well choreographed, some of the best I have seen in fact. I would rival the first war scene from TROY with the one in LOTR 3. In comparison, TROY's war scene special effects are better that LOTR's. TROY is definitely a movie worth watching again and again. So buy the DVD. I highly recommend this movie. I highly doubt that there will be another movie coming soon which will be able to match the scale and grandeur of TROY.",9.0,Anonymous,History
An Excellent Film,"There are films with heart and there are films that are epic.  Troy folds in both those categories and much much more.   Because of bad criticism I was not looking forward to it as much as I was before.   It's fascinating to know what we expect from an epic like Troy.   Look at the list of epics we have been gifted with over the last five decades.   Ben Hur, El Cid, Spartacus, Cleopatra, Braveheart, Gladiator and now Troy.   They are pretty much the same in the way of size, as they all contain huge battles scenes with lot's of heroics and sad endings.   Troy doesn't change that and it brings something a little extra to the table to make it all the more glorious.   Gladiator fans will love this and I think it's fair to say that Troy is a lot better than Gladiator.   As soon as the opening credits pop up the whole movie starts off straight away without a moment to rest and this is how it is till the very end.I have never had the pleasure to read Homer's masterwork Iliad so I wasn't comparing the movie to the book which I prefer because then for me nothing is taken away but straight away after the film finished I wanted to get my hands on the book and see what was in the film and what was taken out as it is just one of the most fascinating movies I have seen for a long time.   I never go home disappointed from the Epic's and continue to do so with Troy.  Orlando Bloom is obviously falling into the same trap as Leonard Di Caprio did with titanic because everyone just seems to hate the guy but,  is he the worst actor in the world that he is made out to be?   I'll admit he is not the best actor but surely he must be praised for the brave performance he gives as Paris.   Some parts did make me feel a bit uneasy with some cheesy dialogue but there were others where he was just fantastic.  Take the scene where he decides to fight Menaleus to win the heart of Helen.  I won't go on any further but it brings to the character of Paris and who he really is. The scene is so well acted by all concerned especially Orlando Bloom who is more than just Legolas in Lord of the Rings.   Brad Pitt is a big surprise as Achillies, Eric Bana as always is on top form and has a rising rising career ahead of him.   Brian Cox and Brendan Gleeson are on top form but I don't see what the fuss is about with Peter O Toole.  No one could ever take away his performance as TE Lawrence but I was lead to believe that he was the strongest actor in  the film.  As far as history goes he is but I have seen him in better films than Troy.  Oliver Reed will always get a vote ahead of O Toole's performance.  In some scenes it was like Wolfgang Petersen shouted `Ok Peter, can you make that face now' and after making it's done it's like he shouts `Ok Pete, that's it' because his expressions during some of the battle scenes and others just don't seem convincing and very put on.  The single scene with Pitt and O Toole is very well done and extremely important but the rest is very questionable.   Deborah Unger was quite a waste of time but that's the script writer's fault for not giving her the time she so well deserved but I still expected to see more of her towards the end.   The battle scenes hit you in all the right places and has plenty of emotion to back it up and bring you to tears in some parts.I look upon Troy with a lot to say about it but can't describe the words I am wanting to say.   It's more epic than you could have ever imagined.  The acting is first class, the music and photography are very well conceived and has quite an old fashioned feel to it.Wolfgang Petersen has never made a bad film.  Das Boot is the prime example of that and along with Air Force One and The Perfect Storm that are good add on's to his collection of movies Troy will open the eyes to people who have never heard of the man and know that he is up there with the best.    Ignore what they are saying, people just can't get over the fact that this is what Hollywood do to famous scriptures and will do for many years to come.   I would feel the same if it was something that I had loved and admired for years and years but I would appreciate that someone is trying to make a film out of it the best way possible and I know there are parts in the film which don't add up to the story but we should be grateful that this does what it's supposed to do and that's wow us and keep the faith.  It deserves that much.",10.0,Anonymous,History
this is not troy,"i really want to say that this movie offends greek people and everyone who has read the real story.First of all,achilleus wasn't serving agamemnon or anyone else.He was born in thessaly and especially in the town i came from(farsala).So the fact that in the beginning he is fighting against thessaly has nothing to do with true.Now in troy,hector kills menelaus and ajax at the first day of the war,when it is known that menelaus survived of the war and went back to sparti with helen of course and ajax killed himself at the last year of the war because of a fight he had with oddyseus about who would take achilleus' weapons after his death.The war lasted 10 years and not of course two weeks.Paris killed achilleus at the 9th year of the war.Also,agamemnon didn't die by the woman in troy,but from his wife when he got back in mikines.And the only trojan who survived from the massacre was aineias,who carried his sick father and his little son in his back.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Brad Pitt spoil what would have been a good movie,"Ever since time immemorial people have been fascinated with the stories of great heroes.Everyone of us has heard the names of Herclules,Samson,king Arthur,and of course Achiles.We all love those stories and when we go to the cinema to see our favorite heroes on screen we expect not only an actor boasting his defined muscles but also an actor who can show on screen real depth of emotions,show us what it was really like to be Hercules,Samson,king Arthur.And if Eric Bana was a convincing Hector,Brad Pitt was nothing close to Achiles. I find that the bast scene in the movie as a whole was the moment when old king Priam went to Achile's tent to beg him for his son's body.The reason?Peter O'Toole's performance.He once again proved his quality as an actor.Unlike Brad Pitt.This could have been the role of his life.Achiles is a great character - the warrior who was born to fight,the warrior,fighting for immortality,the warrior who falls in love and is ready to change his life for this love's sake.But instead of focusing on the emotional side of his character,Pitt seemed to be concentrated only in showing his masculine body...What a pity.If it had not been for his poor acting,the film would have definitely been a good one.Take Eric Bana for example.He was made for that role,he acted with passion and devotion and that definitely showed on screen.If you compare Troy to other historical films like Brave Heart or Gladiator,you will see that what was missing in the film was a good actor in the leading role.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A successful version of an old old tale,"The reviews of this film were so mixed - especially of Brad Pit's acting - that I wasn't sure if I would enjoy this film. I need not have worried. Wolfgang Peterson's directing was superb, the action flowed fluidly and the camera work was brilliant. Reviews have suggested that the film lacked pace but I didn't find this to be true and even though the ending is well known, the unfolding tragedy was deeply moving. The acting was for the most part very good. Brad Pit made an extremely convincing Achilles and Sean Bean, Orlando Bloom and Eric Bana were also excellent. Rose Byrne as Briseis made a good foil to Achilles and was very convincing. I was not so impressed by the other female stars and was especially disappointed in Diana Kruger as Helen. I would have preferred a little more time spent on setting up why Paris eloped with Helen. Although Orlando Bloom's Paris developed and grew as a character - Helen seemed very cardboard. The film certainly was different to the book in many ways but I think it succeeded it giving the essence of the tale.",9.0,Anonymous,History
My Comment,"I don't really like ""war movies"", I just hate all the blood and violence. I watched it because my English teacher was giving out extra credit. I rented the movie and watched it; I have to admit it is a really good movie. Just like a good book, you never want to put the book down; I didn't want to take my eyes off of the television. I feel that the actors did a really good job.After discussing the Trojan War through out all my years in high school, I never really understood it. This movie pretty much explained it well. One of my favorite roles in this movie was Hector; he did a very good job as being a leader and a protector. He was one of the ""good guys"" in the movie and I envied that. I like the scene where Paris backs down in the fight with Menelaus and Hector comes in and kills him. I like that scene because he protected his brother, even after his stupidity of bringing Helen into Troy.Another one of my favorite roles in this movie was Achilles, even though he was not one of the ""good guys"" I liked the scene where he gave Hector's body to Priam. Even though he said that Priam will always be his enemy, he showed respect to him Hector's body. After that talk that Priam had with Achilles, I think Achilles felt really guilty because he was crying over Hector's body.I think it was very foolish that the Trojans accepted the statue of the horse from the Greeks. I mean how can the Greeks hate the Trojans so much, up to the point where they want to demolish them and then all of a sudden end the war and give them a huge statue of a horse? Priam should have listened to his son Paris and burned it.I really enjoyed watching this movie. It was a good experience, I like the plot of the whole thing and the actors fit perfectly well in their roles.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Epic.,"Is it possible to do a review without a least a little spoilage?This movie was so fantastic that I actually managed to shake my anal book-to-movie requirement checklist and just enjoy Troy. So what that Patroclus was not Achilles' cousin, that Briseis was nowhere near that prominent of a character, that the only god/goddess to make a cameo was Achilles' mother, Thetis, in a much smaller role than she was entitled to? Okay, so it bugged me a little bit. But the book is 3000 years old, and has been retold thousands of times in thousands of ways. If people don't get the gist of it by now, then who's to say that they ever will? It did bug me that they left out the whole story of Nestor leading Patroclus to his death. And I was a little miffed by the mispronunciation of Briseis, Menalaus, and Priam. But the discovery that Eric Bana actually CAN act well made up for it, I must say. And even though the scene with the knife was never in The Iliad, I must say that I appreciated its addition for Brad Pitt's Achilles.All in all, I got past the book, which is something I can almost never do. I highly recommend this beautiful movie to anyone, and it is worth every minute of the three hours it takes. Four stars.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Historically ""correct"" for entertainment's sake","Troy is based on Homer's poem, the Iliad, in which we are not assured of any historical fact. Due to this lack of information Wolfang Petersen decided to create fictitious story-lines to please the movie-going public. And it worked. Troy is a passionate, compelling often powerful film that was worth it's duration yet not nearly worth it's quarter of a billion dollar budget.Brad Pitt turns in an unexpectedly excellent portrayal of a Hollywood altered Achilles. Eric Bana gets a five out of ten and Orlando Bloom's weak portrayal of Paris is the down point of the film. His presence may have enticed the female crowd to see this epic, yet in every regretful scene with him he is low and transparent. Nonetheless the younger cast of pretty-boys is made up for by the older more experienced cast including Peter O'Toole and Brian Cox.The war scenes are not what you would have hoped for. They are lacking in comparison to Braveheart and the Lord of the Rings. What you really have to watch out for are the one-on-one fight sequences between the key characters.Troy is an exciting film worth watching even more than once though watch it as a compelling action flick,not as a historical epic.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Best War Movie For a Long time,"WHAT A GREAT MOVIE. Absolutely mind blowing. I went to watch this movie at the theater, and what a movie. Stupendous acting. Finally after a long time, Bradd Pitt proves his worth as an actor. Also Eric Bana is superb. Totally mind blowing.The story is well written, although there are a few goof ups, (like Menelaus, who never actually dies in the entire Trojan war is killed even before it starts, also, Agamemnon, is not killed according to Homer, Helen who supposedly goes back to Menelaus after the end of the war, flees from the Greeks, and the best of the lot, Paris, the prince of Troy who supposedly was to be brutally killed by the Greeks manages to escape through a secret tunnel), but all these goof ups can be overlooked, after watching the movie. The epic battle, the love for one's country, the love for a family member, the love for a brother. Everyhing is so amazingly depicted, it is hard to ignore it. An amazing amazing story, which will surely move your heart. The scene where Hector takes his father's blessing before going out to battle with Achilles, knowing fully well, only death awaits him, is mind blowing. Also, extra ordinary, is the sequence where Achilles' nephew gets killed by Hector, and his men are shocked into learning that he killed a child. And Lastly, the scene where old King Priam begs for Hector's body before Achilles, will surely make your eyes moist. Troy, is indeed a classic, and'm truly surprised that its rating is so low. With such amazing screenplay, mind blowing action, and soothing music, Troy has all the qualities of making a classic, it is very unfortunate that it is so lowly rated.I give it a full 10/10....",10.0,Anonymous,History
Waste of potential,"Large budget, large actors, and a proved director. I would expect a 9 rated movie at the least. Taken at face value this is an exceptional movie, a 7. It's potential far surpassed its achievement. The scripted Orlando Bloom being a pansy to the shallow love affair by Brad Pitt. If only directors would see the obvious shortcomings of a film and change it into a great film. If you want to see a great war movie, this is it. Detailed battle scenes and elaborate props make for something you can really enjoy. This movie is like a boiled steak. It's still going to make for great eating, but in the end your going to be disappointed because you know what it could have been.",7.0,Anonymous,History
An exciting movie of war where heros and legends come to life,"Troy features the battle between Troy itself and the united nations of Greece. The war is caused by one woman, helen who created a dispute between the king of Sparta and Prince of Troy, Paris. This leads to the greed for power of one man, he brother of the king of sparta. He decides to fight the war and win Troy. A hero, Hector, brother to Paris, fights the war for his father, King of Troy, Priam, bravely as a general. However, this all comes down to the main character of the movie, the legend that comes to life, Achilles, the greatest fighter ever known in history. He is partially immortal, except for one of his ankle that is his weakpoint, the only part of him capable of sustaining a mortal wound. His mother, thetis, a nymph, told him that if he goes to war, he will never return again as his glory and honor will die with him. But if he stays, he will find peace. However, born to be a fighter, Achilles sets off for the battle. He dies from an arrow shot by Paris when he was unaware for he was in the process of saving his love, Paris' cousin. (The arrow was shot at his ankle, his mortal weak point). Of course, even hector died at the rage and warth of Achilles when he actually slayed Achilles' cousin whom he thought was Achilles himself. Troy fell in the end and both the kings died. However, the name of Achilles and the other heros will always endure. The story is remarkably captured in the movie and it is a must-see show for all who are into action movies. The show is about 2 hours and 30 minutes.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Epic. Why don't the Greeks like it?,"I loved spending my evening watching this movie. I got my 7 euros worth. Don't know why so many Greeks like me say that we should boycott the movie, because it does not stick to the true story of Troy, as written in Homer's ""The Iliad"".Really, does it even matter if someone who actually lived 3,200 years ago died a little earlier than depicted in the film (Achilles died and never entered Troy)? Or if the role of the Gods is played down? Or if there was a love interest? Or even that the war lasted 10 years and not 15 days as depicted?Hey, no disrespect to Homer but crowds are much tougher today. They got things to do today you know. Back then, they had all the time in the world to listen to the story again and again, all 10 years of it. But this is Hollywood, come on! 160 minutes of running time is long enough already!Really, I enjoyed it very much, it'll make a wonderful addition to my DVD collection in 6 months.",7.0,Anonymous,History
How bad can it get!,"I had high hopes for Troy and I am so bitterly disappointed. The film was directed so badly it made my stomach ache. The pacing was so slow, the dialogue laughable and the film - well apart from a nice fight scene between Achilles (Pitt) and Hector (Bana) - the rest was shallow.And why, oh why does Hollywood always insist on rewriting stories to fit 'consumer approval'. Agamemnon didn't die in Troy, the war lasted 10 years and Achilles was killed by Paris OUTSIDE the walls of Troy with an arrow to the ankle! It annoys me that such a classic story as this is turned into a soap.And don't even start me on the 'lack' of chemistry between Helen and Paris. She was the woman the war was fought over and it didn't even look as if the two of them cared a great deal about the other. No sparks, no emotion, no hope.I have to say in the films defence Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Peter O' Toole acted very well with a bad script but that isn't enough to save this awful movie.Can anybody tell me where the £200 million budget went? Maybe in all the trees they used for the funeral pyres - where did they get all those trees?I am so disappointed it hurts.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Very Impressed! (Not just with Eric's muscles),"Wow! I greatly enjoyed Troy. Being a fourteen year old girl the muscles and short skirts of Brad Pitt, Orlando Bloom and Eric Bana were an obvious highlight for me, but I was surprised at how much I actually enjoyed the movie. The scenery was spectacular, although I noticed there was nothing about the gods tricking Paris into taking Helen back to Troy. There was a fair bit of gore, but I found myself not minding so much, as the battle scenes were wonderfully filmed, and balanced out with the romance and plot.Eric Bana gave the best performance,( as Prince Hector,) and I found myself feeling his emotions, his anger at killing Achilles' cousin by accident, his worry for Troy, and a wave of sadness overcame me when he was defeated. I felt, however, no such empathy for Achilles, as Brad Pitt did not make it easy for the audience to relate to him. All up, I loved the movie and I was very impressed with the digital effects and the way the directors kept to the story.",,Anonymous,History
A strong film with moments of greatness but with problems as well.,"Any review of Troy must be necessarily long and complicated. It is one of those films that gets some things remarkably right and other things remarkably wrong. The result, imbalanced film-making and lengthy reviews.The Cast:Well, so far many have said this and I will add my voice to theirs: Brad Pitt??? Were they thinking? Pitt is a far better actor than most people criticizing this performance grant. But, this was not his performance. They tried harder to match body-type than Screen-Actor type and it hurt the film and Brad Pitt.Orlando Bloom does a decent job but nothing close to what this kid is capable of. His acting is better than in LOTR and Pirates . . . so he's improving but, sadly, don't expect much from a Paris that comes off more pathetic than necessary[Blame the script for this as well].Brian Cox has a good performance but it is shadowed by the sheer brilliance of Peter O'Toole's job as the tragic king of Troy. Undoubtedly, O'Toole will land another Oscar Nod [Supporting of course] and he probably has his best chance of winning one in more than two decades. Eric Bana could surprise us with a2nd Supporting Actor nod for Troy with a performance far better than manyanticipated. He captured the passion and reverence of Prince Hector in a way that shames most of the other cast members.I can sum up the ladies of the cast in one word: Forgettable. None of the female characters stand up to their Male counter parts.The Rest:Cinematography is well done. Especially when one considers the Cinematographer was strapped with demands to make this film look like a marriage between Gladiator and LOTR. Wolfgang Petersen did a good job working with his Cinematographer to get, what in my opinion, are the best possible shots for the script in many areas.Art Direction/Set Direction and Costume Design are well done. If you are a historian, archaeologist, or other purist prepare to be disappointed. The Costumes, while authentic looking, are authentic for other armies and other times. If accuracy is the issue, this stuff fails. If a unified wholistic image that is awe-inspiring in areas and captivating in others, then this stuff succeeds. In short, your degree of satisfaction is based on what degree of historical accuracy you are looking for.Nothing special by way of the Script. Part of Pitt's and Orlando's failure is due to unremarkable lines and even awkward dialogue moments. Editing, Visual Effects, Sound, etc. all acceptable, even well done in areas but nothing so wonderful that we are talking multiple nominations for this film.And, finally, the Score: James Horner is a great composer but this film's score is nothing more than a glue-job of pirated scores and themes. It is mainly influenced by Gladiator with echoes of even the Hercules/Zena t.v. series. Even more alarming is the direct cut of the main theme of Stargate for the final sequences of Troy and the burning of Achilles's body.[On a historical accuracy note: There was a lot of Egyptian-like elements in the film. No doubt the use of the Stargate score meant to echo that.]The Summation:In short an enjoyable and well put together film. Serious issues in the script and the casting [more the fault of the casting director than the actors themselves] causes distinct problems. Definitely worth seeing once.6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,History
Intellectual expectations!,"Despite, Troy is one of the best modern historical epics so far, many people including critics did not like the movie almost at all. Yes, the reason of all the people who did not like the movie is not the same, but I believe that generally this is because of intellectual expectations. It is said that the movie is very bad, because there is no mythological material, or the movie is very bad, because it is not a smart adaptation, instead so conventional. And there are also people who say that they did not enjoy it. If this is not entertainment, what is it then? Troy is not an unusual movie or it is not postmodern or an art house work, but these make the movie bad? Another director might have focused on Helen Paris love affair, then the movie would have been unbearable, but we get involved in the adventure quickly. I know that either, there are some people who hate Brad Pitt and always say he cannot act! Brad Pitt is a great actor. To me, he proved that in Jesse James and Burn After Reading. And his performance in Troy is one of his bests. He reflects his character's power, arrogance and extreme self confidence. And watch the Patroclus scene and see yourself whether he is talented or not. By the way, after the killing, I hated him, he became my enemy, for a while, I even could not follow the movie. If we hated the character, it means that he did a very good job. You don't care about the characters in some movies, Troy is not one of them. The fight between Hector and Achilles is one of the most exciting and fresh fight scenes ever made. Very high adrenalin and great movements. And the mark on the shield. That is matter a lot. The fights in Troy are very critical, not only that one, but also the fight between Paris and Agamemnon. Again very exciting, high adrenalin. Paris does not know how to fight, he is too young to die and if it happens, it becomes a real pity. By the way, in a scene, Paris shows his 'Legolas side'. I said to myself, you are the prince! And the war scenes, the big war. Despite we have seen similar scenes almost a lot of times, it captures you and looks dazzling. I watched it over and over again and still do. In some moments, it is obvious that the army is CGI based, especially the opening scene and the scene which the army walk to the castle throughout the beach. However, it does not ruin the movie exactly. The sneak peek of Troy was from the scene that thousands of ships sail on and every time, it looks dazzling to me. Besides all, Troy has soul. Lastly, all the characters are human being in the movie, as mentioned no mythological material, but this realism somehow becomes an advantage instead disadvantage. Despite I love fantasy genre, realism seems a great idea in the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Troy may be flawed, but is ultimately as fun and entertaining a historical epic as you could hope for","Rewatching this was a fun flashback to my classical languages courses in high school, where we would read (parts of) these classical literary works like The Iliad in their original language (Greek or Latin), thoroughly studying the themes, characters, motives, cultural significance and so on. Often there were modern pieces of pop culture thrown in to demonstrate the lasting impact of those works, like how one teacher would show us The Usual Suspects and connect that film to De Bello Gallico through their similar use of an unreliable narrator (Julius Caesar -> Keyser Söze, think about it!).I had a lot of fun during those classes, translating and interpreting those stories, comparing the way stories are told through different mediums etc. In hindsight, I would even (partly) credit this classical languages portion of my education for instilling in me a bourgeoning interest in different kinds of culture and (maybe even more so) learning some of the principles to apply when interpreting films, books or plays.All of this to say that during Greek class, we would read The Iliad, dissecting the different themes of the story, doing character deep dives on Agamemnon and Achilles and analyzing the roles of the many Gods and their significance in Greek culture. In this case of course, the companion piece was an obvious choice and so we would watch scenes from the movie Troy that corresponded with certain passages of the book and analyze how the text was translated unto the screen.This was my first time watching Troy since those Greek classes about 15 years ago and honestly, I was prepared to hate it. Having seen many, many films since that first viewing, I have learned a fair bit about my own preferences and I know from experience that sprawling, historical epics are usually not something I really enjoy watching. I just get tired from the mind-numbing violence, the big, corny speeches, the melodrama and just the overall self-seriousness of it all. That being said, I sat down, watched the full Director's Cut of Troy (which runs for a hefty 196 minutes) and even though all of that stuff is in there, I still kinda liked it.This is a big budget blockbuster about a war of mythical proportions, so there are obviously going to be some extensive fight sequences, but I was pleasantly surprised at how this film actually takes its time to lay out the most important themes, conflicts, characters and motives from the text and gives its story room to breathe before getting to those big action set pieces. It pits Agamemnon and Achilles against each other from the very beginning and makes it clear throughout what drives these two self-obsessed men: one is fueled by an insatiable greed and lust for power, the other is obsessed with building his legacy and being remembered as the greatest warrior who ever lived. As far as I can remember, this is the central conflict at the core of The Iliad and this film addresses it in a satisfying manner. Furthermore, we understand how King Priam has blind faith in the will of the Gods and the impenetrable high walls of Troy, which ultimately dooms his beloved city. We get to know Hector as a reluctant warrior driven by love for his city and his father. And Paris is exposed for the whiny little brat that he is.The film is obviously far from perfect and there are many grievances to be found if you are so inclined. For example, there are a still a great many liberties taken with the original text. On the other hand, this can be expected and is probaby even preferable when adapting a 3000 year-old poem (which was initially passed along solely as an oral tradition for generations) into a feature film. There are some dumb and tired 'Hollywood movie' tropes though, which is most evident with the character of Briseis, who is turned into a love interest for Achilles. I remember the capture of Brises as actually being part of the conflict between him and Agamemnon, but turning her into a damsel in distress to be wooed by Achilles' deep philosophical thoughts feels grating. I won't spoil it, but I also immensely disliked the bit of historical rewriting they had her do at the end of the film (that was just too big a liberty to take with the 'original' story in my opinion). Additionally, there are definitely some of those aforementioned big, cheesy speeches and dumb lines of dialogue here, with some of the actors hamming it up a bit too much while delivering them.I would say however that overall, the good outweighs the bad in Troy. The film takes its time to set the stage and does about as good a job of developing its characters as one could reasonably expect from a big Hollywood blockbuster like this, while still delivering all the obligatory bombastic action. There are some iconic set pieces with the battle between Hector and Achilles (Hectooorrr!!!) and the big climax inside the walls of Troy as standouts. Both sequences are gripping and actually make an emotional impact, precisely because we have gotten to know these characters and understand what drives them. So as far as big budget historical epics go, Troy provides a pretty fun and entertaining ride without dumbing things down too much, making its +3 hour runtime seemingly fly by.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Raw and crude but so real,"Great to have the chance to revisit this movie 🎥 16 years after its release and my last viewing. It is undoubtedly a very thrilling show, everything from start to finish, plot to actors, sound to music 🎶 , scene to costume. Its greatness is magnified by great acting skills of great Hollywood heavyweights like Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Orlando Broom.
While being highly bloody and crude, this movie is deeply fascinating in that it depicts a very genuine picture of human nature. As we all know everything in this world is complicated, so is the soul of this movie. Politics and history, war and peace, love and hate, women and sex, greed and generosity, enmity and respect cannot be more paradoxically reflected in the story, so much so that I find it a bit hard to accept although able to comprehend, and so much so that it makes you feel a bit psychologically hard to breathe, like jumping into freezing waters in the middle of the Atlantic. Yet again my cynicism has somehow captured me in that I pity human nature just as Briseis the princess in the movie pities soldiers.
I find it very real and almost a bit surreal that we all exist to serve the function of a larger mechanism, sometimes at our free will or otherwise with little or no choices.
What a well spent evening with such a wonderful movie . I find myself increasingly engrossed into movie 🎥 plots. Even right now the scene in the movie 🎥 are still playing in my mind. I did not expect myself to be such a philosophical and perhaps a bit literary person.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Every cliché in the book, but i liked it","Troy opened up with some music, a little too heavily synthesized, building up tension between two humongous armies approaching each other. The suspense comes to a halt in an anticlimactic moment, as the all-powerful king cracks a joke. He then persuades his opponent to have their respective armies' best soldier fight each other rather than a more traditional all-out battle to spare bloodshed and gore. This is another anticlimax of sorts, we expected a big all-out fight and now we're not getting one, and now the squeamish people in the audience who don't like to see a bloody battle can feel relief. Within seconds, the next clever plot twist arrives, as we find our hero, Achilles, who we're looking forward to seeing because he's played by A-lister Brad Pitt, is actually missing from the battlefield because he had a wild night of passion and overslept, but he wakes up and goes out to the battlefield, where awaiting us are plot twists #4, that Brad Pitt is not as friendly as we thought he'd be, and #5, that the cocky guy twice his size is really no match for him.Within five minutes, every trick in the book has been used and while it's unoriginal, those gimmicks might have worked in other circumstances, but here, they felt like a half-desperate attempt to make sure that any and every mainstream viewer would be hooked onto this film. The original story of Troy, just wasn't gonna cut it, the producers probably thought. It's too long-winded, too complicated, these people regularly talk and interact with Gods, who would go for that? So the producers gave us a more Americanized version.When rallying his troops to war, Prince Hector cries, ""no men, we all love our families, we all love our country, and we all love our Gods"", which sounds just like how the president would address soldiers today, making the audience think, ""oh, I was originally not sure if I'd like this boring Greek story, but these characters are so universal and I can relate to them,"" but the truth is that those characters weren't relatable, because, yes they might have had some love for family or for country, but they're love for their Gods was much stronger and incredibly different than our love of Gods today. Not only did they believe in more than one God, but they weren't abstract beings from an unknown place in the sky, they regularly came down and interacted with the humans, they were recognizable detailed beings with different attributes and they didn't all like each other, not did they like all of the humans equally. In the Illiad, the gods Apollo and Athena are even rooting for the Trojans to win the war and actively help control the turn of events. In fact, Achilles is half-God himself, that's why he can run so fast. These parts of the story were vaguely referenced but ultimately left out to spare confusion.I really didn't get what the point was of digging up and adapting a Great work of Greek literature of they were going to strip it of it's Greekness. If I wanted to see great special effects, I could have gone to The Day After Tomorrow, but I chose to see this because of the cultural context of this story, where Gods were more numerous and warriors had a different place in society. This is definitely part of a trend that echoes our new global era in politics, where barriers between countries are being lowered and people around the world are discovering they have a lot in common. At the same time, though, our differences in cultures over history should be celebrated too, and it's a more worthless experience when the makers of this film chose to leave out those cultural quirks.I also think another force in play, which isn't the film's fault, necessarily, is how tightly all the big-budget films are released within one summer. Ten years ago, Forrest Gump opened in the summer of '94 and made 24,000 in its opening weekend, taking the #1 spot, dropped only 1.3% percent the next weekend, and was the #1 movie 6 weekends of that year. Troy, opened only 5 days before a highly anticipated Shrek, which made an eye-popping $125 million by weekend's end. Troy cost 175 million to make, so in order to make its money back it had to attract audiences attentions, and I think the filmmakers were under so much pressure to make that return that they made a safer picture with surefire widespread appeal, which deprived of us of what could have been a great movie.I don't know how this could be fixed, but it's a clear sign that the onslaught of new summer blockbuster after blockbuster, each one displacing the one before it as #1, is taking its toll on the quality of films.Sorry to drift into a tangent there, so back to the film. I still gave it 3 and a ½ stars, because once I accepted the Americanized road I was traveling on, I could enjoy the film's dramatic moments, the cinematography and, with the exception of Orlando Bloom, a first-rate ensemble. Homer wrote an incredible story, so it was hard not to be moved, and I have heard an argument that this Americanized version has encouraged viewers to read the book and culturally enhance themselves. I just think that the film, if it stuck to its roots, could have been better.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Great Movie,"If you love period movies,TROY is a treat.Brad Pitt makes u believe he is Achilles.The War sequences are beautifully shot and so are the one to one combat scenes.The combat between Hector(Bana) and Achilles is the best I have ever seen,especially cause the fight is not the usual,basic sword/spear fight,rather it is very intelligently choreographed; with unconventional fighting styles.The special effects are very convincing.The cast is perfect and everybody does justice to their character,and i don't think any other could play Achilles as good as Brad.The movie may be just under 3hrs long but is fast paced and keeps u engaged.It's a must watch for all period movie buffs.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Best movie of a long time!!!10 STARS!!!,"We went to see Troy on the weekend and we loved it.I know some of the critics did not like this movie,but for me,it was a great one.And why to analyze a movie so much,as some of the reviewers did?Could have been better.Maybe,but who cares?The 2 and a half hrs. time went so fast,I could not believe it.The computer images were so good,you could not see them,not like in Lord of the Ring.I think this movie was much better then any of the Ring trilogy.At least we did not have to see a boring character like Mr.Frodo.The fight scenes were very good,the girls were beautiful ,the music was excellent.Well,I give 10 stars for this one and I will buy it on DVD the first day is out.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"""Strike a Pose Brad Pitt""","I feel this movie was mainly showing Brad Pitt's statue like physique off. If you may have noticed every opportunity he was given he would ""strike a pose"". But all in all it was very good as far as the cinematography, and sound was concerned. I loved the thousand ships. I also feel that Hector was the better actor and I was impressed with his role. His acting was great. The actress that they used (who was she?) to play Helen of Troy wasn't as beautiful as history described her to be, well actually they could have gotten a prettier actress. Who would you have suggested to be that actress? They should have depicted the meaning of Achilles's death (why he died by getting shot by a arrow in his heel). Achilles was half mortal and half demigod. His mother dipped into water hold him by only his heel. So the only part of his body that was fatal was his achilles tendon. Historically it was some what accurate if you know your Greek Mythology.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"very inaccurate, overall poor","firstly i should say that i know the story of the Iliad and its associated plays and poems very well. i know the Iliad by homer, the aenead by Virgil, the orestia by Aeschylus etc etc. you don't need to know these stories before you see the movie. i am also a fan of gladiator even though i know it's inaccurate and it is just a remake of the fall of the roman empire. that didn't stop me enjoying that movie.if i was to give troy a grade it would be 7 out of 10 for entertainment value (not as good as gladiator) and it would be 3 out of 10 for its literary and historical value. its treatment of the original stories stink just about as bad as anything i have ever seen. i wish the liberties they took had been in order to inject something greater into what remained, but everything still felt flat and never really took off. it never really ever even approached the level of a masterpiece and that is a real shame.the battle scenes are without question fantastic, though there are not as many as you would expect, and the special effects are by and large seamless with the actual landscape. the music was very dull and forgettable and the camerwork was for the most part very good.brad Pitt has an amazing body and i think he is an excellent actor but in troy he seemed uncomfortable in the role and that surprised and disappointed me. peter o'toole was an excellent priam and his scene with Achilles was tremendous. hector was played by Eric bana and he really surprised me. the role of hector is very close to the original, and despite the fact that hector was physically bigger in the stories, Eric bana really made up for his lack of stature. he was a wonderful hector. Paris was played by Orlando bloom and he played a coward very well indeed, he surprised me too considering. the lady playing Helen i don't remember but i didn't find her either very attractive or very good and she doesn't even appear a the end of the film, she's lost from the story completely! sean bean who i usually don't like played one of my favorite Greek characters, the wily odysseus he was okay. vigo mortensen is the prefect odysseus, but bean also surprised me. the man playing menelaus was completely miscast, but on purpose it seems, and agammemnon was good.the movie starts with agammemnon at war with thessaly and Achilles fights under his flag and wins a duel with thessaely's best. this sets up that Achilles hates agammemnon who is a war monger, it's a love hate relationship true to the spirit of the original. since it's ironic considering Achilles is the best warrior and lives for battle. Achilles wins and Greece is united for the first time. this is not historically accurate, Greece was never united as such, but it will do for the movie in place of complicated explanations.then we go to a peace banquet at argos which in the movie they call Sparta since it's the same place. the banquet is between king menelaus and his wife Helen and Paris representing troy with his brother hector. this is the first diviation from the original because before it was Aeneas, who was second to hector as a Trojan general and went on to found ancient Rome. but in this movie he doesn't appear except for one line at the end, and Paris doesn't even know him, odd for the cousin of king priam!Paris woos Helen, hector covers for him, and when they leave, Helen is smuggled out because she doesn't love her husband. i should say here that is all wrong too. originally menelaus was called away to his grandfather's funeral on Crete, and Paris and Aeneas then looted menelaus's vaults and took women (plural) as a prize. menelaus was also young and had been chosen by Helen herself and after the Trojan war they got back together and had other adventures, but in this movie menelaus is a fat old bully. this makes the Trojans look better i suppose but it's a distortion and not a pleasing one.so Agamemnon decides this is the perfect excuse to go to war to get troy for himself. however, if you have ever read Herodotus you will know that the Greeks had been undergoing many attacks for decades and the in actual fact this was the first time in history that the Greeks collectively had had enough and decided to fight back! so that is all wrong.the Greeks go to troy once odysseus has convinced Achilles to fight, that was a good scene, with Achilles practicing fighting with his (now cousin) patroclus. patroclus's treatment in the film mirrors the motives in the original so it was fairly entertaining. patroclus comes with him and wants to fight but is not ready.the Greeks arrive at troy and a ferocious battle takes place and a priestess is taken captive, trophy for Achilles. this is all greatly condensed but done very well and is very exciting. we meet ajax who is known as the equal of Achilles. in the original ajax after all the years of war goes mad when his friend Achilles is killed and commits suicide. in this film he barely know Achilles and is killed by hector in the first few minutes! ajax was the character with the soul but in this he's a big oaf. that disappointed me greatly but there was more to come.in the original the Greeks declare that troy can save themselves if menelaus has a duel with Paris, but Paris is pressed into fighting bby hector who is furious for his brother starting this war, and Paris is a coward. in the movie it is Paris who asks for the duel, and again he acts like a coward and tries to run away halfway through. but because it is him who asked for the fight it makes the Trojans look nobel again when they're not! menelaus goes after Paris, and now hector kills him! so menelaus who for three thousand years has always got his wife back, now doesn't! this is so stupid and also forgets that it was a nervous Trojan archer called panadarus who fires out of nerves that starts the next battle.the Greeks take a pounding which is very exciting and they must retreat. the Trojans breathe a sigh of relief and at dawn they attack and try to burn the ships (with bizarre flaming balls, i don't know where they got that idea from) Achilles refuses to fight for Agamemnon so patroculs wears Achilles armor into battle and hector kills him, this sends Achilles into a frenzy and the most gripping duel takes place between Achilles and hector and he drags hector's dead body around in the dirt. this part of the movie is more or less just like the original and is the best part because this is the only part of the movie that seems to work for everyone in the audience.what is missing completely however is the sense of futility that occurred during the Trojan war. in the originals, every time the Greeks thought they had won, more reinforcements would arrive to help troy. amazon warrior women and the black memnon with his Ethiopian forces, but this is all completely missing. in the film instead cuts to the end of the story, priam rightly gets hector's body back from Achilles, and Achilles grants him 12 days for funeral games, but now the film does its own story again and the Greeks use this excuse to build the horse as an offering to the gods for their ruse.in the original odysseus had managed to get inside troy and desecrated their temple to pallas-Athena, a horse called the pilladium. the Trojan horse was built as a fake apology to the god for their safe trip home. in the film it's an offering to Poseidon. it makes no odds, but it's annoying.anyway the Greeks get in and torch the city, but Agamemnon, who in the original went home and was murdered by his wife ina fantastic play, in this film gets killed! Paris does kill Achilles with arrows, but who knows if he goes off with Helen, she disappears completely from the story.with the story annoyances to one side, i did not like how the film was directed or written, many parts had very hammy dialogue and the way it was directed was very cheesy, gladiator dealt with the cheese much better than this film does. i did like the battle scenes they were excellent, but it was very obvious that many of the actors also had problems with the cheesy parts.what really annoyed me the most was that movie made the war feel like it lasted about 4 days not the 10 years it's supposed to be, and i also absolutely loathe the fact that the movie came down heavily in favor of the Trojans and not the Greeks. but the originals are supposed to be about each side finding humanity in the other, in this movie it's al about finding humanity in the Trojans - who are the ones that did wrong to begin with, and finding no humanity in the Greeks. that is all wrong. period.overall it was moderately entertaining, not as good as gladiator, which it was trying to be in some parts, and whatever you do if you're studying this in class don't use this film as reference. you will fail.overall 5/10",1.0,Anonymous,History
A different subject matter.,"I only became aware after doing some research on the internet that Troy was based on Homer's Illiad (which is on my ""to read"" list). My initial impression was that Troy was in the vein of Gladiator, although covering a different subject (which it is).The performances seemed a bit stilted initially, I was worried that Eric Bana might be falling short on the acting skills. I noticed all the other actors including Brad Pitt gave the same delivery which left me conclude that perhaps they'd done too many takes in a row. I got used to that anyway or it wasn't a problem, the events of the film were interesting enough that it fell by the wayside. The casting was good, I always think Brad Pitt does well in non-pretty boy roles, even Orlando Bloom who's still riding the post-Lord of the Rings wave suits his character overall. It's reassuring that Eric Bana had the presence to pull off his role convincingly, and this film will surely look good on his resume.Troy doesn't have much in common with Gladiator except it involves war and is set in ancient times, it covers different themes and is more philosophical, thanks to Homer no doubt.Troy was a pleasant surprise for me, the film was better than I thought it was going to be. I can understand how small things can affect how big a film is in the high pressure environment of the US box office, but with its worldwide presence it'll still be remembered in years to come.",,Anonymous,History
Interesting but NOT an epic...,"TROY was an interesting movie, and I'll probably buy the DVD when it comes out, but it won't be a repeat view at the movies for me. The first hour is so campy it's comparable to an episode of the old 60's BATMAN TV show, but the last 45 minutes or so saves the entire movie.As a wrestling fan, I have to say that Brad Pitt does a great imitation of Raven, in his ""everything is about me"" attitude. Truthfully, ANYONE else would have been better in this role..including Raven himself, probably. Pitt is just SO over the top it's scary...and it marrs what otherwise would have been a great character. I didn't find myself liking the character at all, even for what it was...I found myself wishing his scenes would end ASAP.The movie's true stars in my own opinion is Peter O'Toole, who should pull out an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor; and Eric Bana, who isn't one of my favorite actors, is fantastic as Hector. Orlando Bloom, who I usually like, is thrust in many scenes into a cowardly version of Legolas and sometimes his scenes are truly laughable.Garrett Hedland, playing Patroclus, is the discovery of the movie...he often steals the scenes he's part of in such a way that he doesn't come across as over the top, but subtle...you have to be, since most of his scenes are with Pitt.All in all it was an enjoyable almost three hours...but too much overacting will keep it from being the dynamically remembered epic that most of the critics out there are claiming it to be...My score - 6",6.0,Anonymous,History
Instant classic,"The performances of the actors were great. The story line also was on the money. Their option to leave out all of the gods involved and to focus more on what the people did was an excellent idea. If Gladiator was a movie to remember, this has gone one step further. From opening shots to striking take down, from battle scenes to dialogs, this film captures you. You almost forget that this movie is over two hours long. Its as though you get consumed by the movie and get set in a trance. Even thought you know what is coming next, you are still surprised to see the delivery and interpretation. The main fight scene leaves you in awe. If you have not seen it yet, there is no need to wait! This is an instant classic...",10.0,Anonymous,History
Eric Bana gives an amazing performance!,"I am such a huge fan of Eric Bana after seeing this movie. I had only seen him in ""Chopper"" before this film and I was so impressed. He really stands out as being a truly talented actor. On the other hand, Brad Pitt was only mediocre. I usually like him but I didn't think he was right for the part of Achilles. He didn't make me care about the character. Orlando Bloom was good as well. Overall, I enjoyed this movie but it's very long, you really have to be in the mood for an epic. One thing that bothered me was that in the film, the Trojan War only lasted three days but according to the story I think it was more like years and decades. I think that should have been reflected.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Brad Pitt's Achilles' Heel,"""Brad Pitt picks up a sword and brings a muscular, brooding presence to the role of Greek warrior Achilles in this spectacular retelling of 'The Iliad'. Orlando Bloom and Diane Kruger play the legendary lovers who plunge the world into war, Eric Bana portrays the prince who dares to confront Achilles, and Peter O'Toole rules Troy as King Priam. Director Wolfgang Petersen recreates a long-ago world of mighty warships, clashing armies, the massive fortress city, and the towering Trojan Horse.""Director Peterson does a good job keeping this long, big-budgeted epic rolling; especially, he is good with the chest-piercing battle scenes. The film's thesis; a more plausible, historically, version of the mythological ""Iliad"", is a good one - if only the ancient Library of Alexandria in Egypt hadn't burned, we'd know so much more about the era Although the film is beautifully produced, the computer generated ""look"" is, at times, distracting; don't look too carefully, for example, at those mighty warships.During the picture, Brad Pitt was experiencing a second wave of mega-box office popularity; and, while his on screen presence undoubtedly thrilled millions, he is not entirely successful in the ""Achilles"" role. The camera treats Mr. Pitt as a drugstore paperback novel cover boy - with biceps and blond mane prominently displayed. He is obviously trying to essay the role, but Pitt most often looks to be simply posed. Consequently, the usually ultra-sexy Pitt appears almost sexless. Rose Byrne's ""Briseis"" helps, thoughThe more sexy story involves Orlando Bloom's ""Paris"" irritating big brother Eric Bana's ""Hector"" by taking Diane Kruger's ""Helen"" as his lover. Of the four ""hot"" young leads (if you count Pitt, Bloom, Kruger, and Bana), Mr. Bana comes off the best, with Ms. Kruger edging out Mr. Bloom as the prettiest. Peter O'Toole and a strong supporting cast look as good, if not better, than the stars. Worth checking out, for the spectacle (great art direction/set direction & costume design) - and for Eric Bana's acting one-upmanship.******* Troy (2004) Wolfgang Petersen ~ Brad Pitt, Orlando Bloom, Eric Bana",7.0,Anonymous,History

This movie has all the things you need to make a fun and interesting movie. It has romance, drama, action, and war as well as others. Wolfgang Peterson has yet again made a movie that you actually want to sit through since gladiator. I would strongly suggest that everyone see this movie. And even though you hear some people say that they don't like it or it isn't believable, they don't know what they are talking about since this is one of the best movies of our time.

"Good, but not good enough.","I didn't expect much from Troy, and I'm glad that I set my expectations low. It was a good film, but nothing more. I can see it being overtaken by future films this year, quite easily (although it should achieve a Best Director nomination next year in the Oscars). The film was done justice, but it just didn't have the factor that so many other films had. It was a long film, with very little put into it.I felt that Peterson could have done so much more with this epic concept. It was just battle after sex scene after battle after sex scene and a little bit of ""honour"" and ""glory"" sandwiched in between.Nevertheless, I found Eric Bana's performance a stand-out from all the other characters. His portrayal of The Prince of Troy was dignified and greatly acted. I was hoping to be impressed by Orlando Bloom, but alas. The best scene with Bloom in was his cowardly solitary fight against Helen's ""husband"". Otherwise, he was exactly the same as in any other movie. I think that we will see a different side of Bloom, once he is given a more challenging and diverse role.I did find the film entertaining, and I did feel sad at the end (the last 20 minutes were spectacular), but it just wasn't as good as it could have been. However, it is definetly worthwhile seeing! 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
The rebirth of the epic movies,"I went to see this movie the first day it came out, but I took two days to have the impressions settled , instead of rushing in to post them into the fray without giving them a thought at all. Maybe there's a lesson to learn for many who didn't do so and now are ashamed of the heated words they uttered with heads still buzzing from the movie showing.I liked this movie. It is from a genre thought long gone and dead, the epic movies, which supposedly have no place in our age of politically correctness and financial greed. This is a movie for men, and men alone, a story about brotherhood, friendship, courage, patriotism, and above all heroism (yes, that defunct concept akin to stupidity). There's no romance to appease and bring into the cinema room the middle class housewife; there are no silly/funny sidekicks to amuse and entertain the kids. Leave them at home. It's not a movie for the pacifist or for the intellectual - there are no attempts in openly preaching the ugliness of war and no convolute psychological and moral twists of kafkian or dostoievskain nature.As such, the movie is doomed not to make 'enough' money as it caters to a very thin category - and this will undoubtedly please those critics across the world which have , for a long time , tried to fit every movie in a bed of Procust and bash it if it doesn't fit one or another rigid demand.The story *is* flatly told, and some of the lines *are* ridiculous. There is some bad acting and some absurd moments.For that , I would have given the movie an solid 8.5 but I've given it a 10 to balance the 1's and 2's a bit and to reward the risks taken by ignoring all the above described marketing wisdom.For I am glad that once in a while movies like this are still coming out.Movies that speak about times when a man had to guard his own with a sword and a shield and he had only the support of a handful of neighbours and friends to count upon - and he valued and cherished these men above all the pleasures and delights of life. When your enemy would stare you straight in the face and would expect no quarter - for he will give you none. A time of darkness and blood undoubtedly - but also a time of heroes. When I'll need to show my boy an *ideal* of what being a man really is about, this will be one of the movies I'll show him. And when I'll need to show him how men *really* are, I'll show him ""American Beauty"" :-)*I*, as a fanatic of movies accurately depicting large scale battles, could never have enough of them. And since the '60s when the large armies of figurants began to cost too much for such movies to be produced, people like me were left waiting. It's good that the CGI tech is finally coming of age and enables us to see spectacular scenes of fighting once again (it all started again with a B movie called ""The Mummy"", if you remember...""Gladiator"" came long after that).I tire of telling people not to blame the actors for the flatness and stupidity of some lines a dumb scenarist is placing in their mouth. As of late (see ""The Lord of the Rings"" ) Hollywood seems to think any 120$/h scenarist can do better in writing than Homer or Tolkien and thus it shamelessly mutilate ages-old stories at the whim of a producer who knows what ""sells best"" at the moment. Case in question , some of Brad Pitt's lines , which always begins with ""You are "" (""my best friend/the single king I am listening to/the only one I care about /the one that brought me peace/ a courageous man/ the best fighter I've fought"" and so on. Now I've seen the lines being derided all over the movie's forum, but is it Pitt's fault that the scenarist lacks, of all things , talent and imagination?How about the ""sword of Troy"" moment? ""What's your name, you unimportant faceless teenager running scared in the dark?"", ""Aeneas, mylord"" , ""well, here's the future of our nation, you take good care of it , allright?"". Why bother with the sword of Troy altogether? It's textbook inacurate and useless for the movie except for the embarrassing moment that I described above (and yes, I do count Paris partially redeeming itself by running back hurt to recover it in the face of advancing Greeks). And if you do place it in, why not let Aeneas be who he really was, a minor son of the king , but a courageous participant in the siege, and indeed, the saviour of his people.I went through all this because I did like Brad Pitt's acting and I feel like defending it. Achille is a larger then life character. Like Aragorn in LOTR, it's impossible to play it perfectly. But if anyone can play a Greek demigod, a culmination of beauty and power, a creature of lust and war, with the lack of sensitiveness and remorse afferent, Pitt's the man. I think he did a very good job. And he *does* look incredible , a reason more to leave the wife at home :-)But the great role was Eric Bana's Hector. I was following this guy since ""Black Hawk Down"", I am glad someone had finally seen his potential - and he delivers a Hector exactly as I imagined it. If he does nothing else after this, which I hope is not the case, I'll always remember his name for this one role.They wasted Sean Bean again - I thought his Boromir was worth a secondary role Oscar nomination, well, he has even less opportunity to show how good he is in this one. But for the moments he was on screen, it was*his* screen.Excellent Peter O'Toole - well the guy's a legend anyway , but don't you like seeing someone who kept acting for 50 years still able to raise the bar for all the crew?Also very good Brendan Gleeson and Brian Cox - the fight with Paris was one of the highlights of the movie.And while at this, they must have had one of the best individual fight choreographers this side of ""Rob Roy"" - can anyone tell me who it is? See the culmination point in Hector's duel with Achilles (and the build-up to it, Hector's farewell to his wife) - now I feel that's a classic moment that will stay in the cinema's history for years to come.Helen and Paris - I thought they were the weaker spots of the movie. While I can see that Paris's inconsistent character is clearly due to a lack of understanding from the scenarist on how(or whether) a spineless, spoiled, don-juanesque prince can grow up into a leader of his people, Helen's character was consciently diminished to make apparent the director's take on the fact that the real reason for the war was political supremacy and not the beautiful princess. While consistent with the realism that Petersen tried to maintain in the movie(see the lack of gods interference, so important in the Iliad itself), I think this was a mistake. An increase in Helen's role would have not only brought more women into the cinemas, but would have given an interesting twist to the old question of how far are men willing to go for a pair of beautiful er..., eyes.I have only good words for the battle scenes. If there were mistakes, I didn't see them. Highlight: the Trojan phalanx pushing the Greek one, decimated by ""the best archers in the world"" .Nice music, though the mix of archaic vocalisis with Hollywood like drums and tuba seemed odd at points. Better if they would have kept only the first side of it and use the primitive drums (that work so well in the Hector and Achille's final confrontation) across all battle scenes.I thought the costumes and the scenery were great, and it did fill my imaination on how protoistoric high Mediterranean civilisation cities might have looked, as architecture and dressing code. As far as I could tell, Troy was very accurately built, looking very much like in a documentary I've seen a couple of years ago (no, I don't watch the crap they put on History Channel before each historical movie to keep the hype up).Overall, a good men's for men movie. Grab your beer drinkin gang and see it, leave the wife and kids at home. And if you read the professional critics opinions about it, remember that these are the same guys who criticized Spielberg's ""Jurasic Park"" for lacking the depth of ""Schindler's List"". Do not compare pears and apples, the Greeks used to say: place the movie in its category and then rank it. This one, I say , stands up very high ; indeed, up with the best of them.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Its desire to be great is its doom, just like it was Achilles'.","For a big-budget Wolfgang Petersen production, it had the potential to be so much better. All he needed was to lose a few things. Brad Pitt, for one.Watching this 163minutes (too) long adventure, I did enjoy quite a few parts. The foreshadowing of the attack on Troy by the Greeks was handled in a similar manner to the Helm's Deep battle in LOTR: Two Towers, mostly because it featured a strong fortress-like wall and a tense build-up that culminated in a very fierce battle. I liked this part; I thought it was well-done.Other than that, Troy simply doesn't hold one's interest; it is too long and tries too hard to be ""epic"" without succeeding. I really can't emphasize enough just how wrong I think Brad Pitt is for the part of Achilles. Sure, he's got the vanity part down alrightbut he's still too much likeBrad Pitt. It's annoying and distracting.Diane Kruger as Helen of Sparta/Troy truly is the face that could launch a thousand ships for me. Yet her beauty is rivaled to that of Rose Byrne's and Saffron Burrows'. The casting directors should definitely have gone with less pretty girls to emphasize Diane Kruger as Helen and make it more believable that 50,000 Greeks would set out to fight for her. Now, with all the gorgeous girls everywhere, it's almost a little overblown. It goes back to what I said about ""trying too hard"" and it seems as though this is Troy's inherent flaw. I guess that could relate to the themes of Achilles in the Iliad. Achilles' desire to be great and glorified leads to his doom, just like Troy's desire to be a great, epic film leads to its failure, but I sincerely doubt the filmmakers had this irony in mind. In fact, I'm quite sure they mostly had box-office success in mind and made this film according to the standard recipe for Hollywood adventure.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Brad Pitt, who usually turns in a good job of acting, was completely miscast, and utterly uncomfortable and unbelievable in his role of Achilles.

"As Hollywood epics go, not a bad try","We saw Troy last night.Frankly, I was expecting the worse, and I was pleasantly surprised. Overall, this is an enjoyable movie (though not one you would watch over and over again).Naturally, the movie is a very rough approximation of Homer. But Hollywood was never known for sticking to the text or carrying about historical details. But on the plus side, you see Petersen taking the text, and putting his own original imprint on it. Homer's Trojan War was essentially a war of gods using men (or should I say, goddesses) to wage battles on Mount Olympus. But the movie chucks all gods and talks about war as it really is - a product of human greed and hunger for power. At times, the movie really felt like an anti-war movie in some respects.As for the actors, I was really impressed with Eric Bana (Hector) - he really came off as genuine human and humble hero. I also really liked Peter O'Toole as Priam - a man with honor most kings would not and did not have. Ditto for the actor who played Odysseus. Even Brad Pit (Achilles) did a decent job portraying a man who views military prowess as the only way to secure his place in history, but eventually realizes the insanity of killing others for the sake of glory.The movie did have a few rough spots. Selection of Diana Kruger as Helen of Troy was probably a mistake - she just does not seem the type over which men would spend decades fighting about. But may be Petersen had a point - the war was not really about Helen at all. For my money, she was not even the best-looking woman in the movie - that honor goes to Hector's wife. In any event, I would have preferred to see Gabrielle Anwar or Keira Knightley as Helen. Hey, I am biased:)Also, the bit about Helen running away with Paris to ""grow old with him"" was just silly - Paris, as portrayed by Orlando Blum, is young and weak and runs from bed to bed. He just is not likely to inspire that kind of sentiment in a woman.The movie also could have used some better background information. Achilles' military prowess and his eventual death do not make sense unless you know that Achilles has divine power on his side and has only one vulnerable spot - the one that would lead to his demise.But overall - a good experience. I recommend it.",,Anonymous,History
"Y'Know, for an 'Epic,' They Sure Did Spend a Lot of Time on That One Beach","Epic (n.) 1) An extended narrative poem in elevated or dignified language, celebrating the feats of a legendary or traditional hero.Personally, I'd define an epic FILM as being huge in scale, scope and size, something most of the '10' voters for this film apparently haven't ever seen.  This can be anything at all, kids.  ""The Bridge on the River Kwai,"" from so many years ago.  Even as recent as ""The English Patient,"" or the directors cut of ""The Abyss.""  It can and does exist, with dozens of characters, places and events.""Troy"" does not fit any of these categories.  Nine-tenths of the film take place in one of two locations (the walls of Troy, or the beach next to it), and the numerous characters speak in wooden, clunky dialogue that was so un-memorable, I couldn't even recall any from the time I saw it, to the time I'm typing this.  And the theater wasn't that far of a drive.Brad Pitt?  Yeah, he's pretty.  Peter O'Toole?  Great actor, but you can't win an Oscar when you only have six lines.  Most of the actors (save the gorgeous but one-note Diane Kruger) held their own, too, but they weren't given much to do.  Director Wolfgang Peterson is one of the few living directors who COULD deliver an epic, but the entire film collapses under the weight of a boring, paint-by-numbers script riddled with cliches and predictibility.  Want to know who's going to die next?  List the above-the-title actors in order from Most Famous to Least Famous, and start at the bottom.Yes, it's very pretty; lots of money was spent and evidently we're all still impressed by computer-generated armies.  Lots of people will go see this movie and think it's great, and then forget about it by June.  There's really no reason to see this except it's trendy the week of May 14th, 2004-- it's structured and written like an over-budgeted Soap Opera, from a screenwriter who didn't exist before last year and probably won't after this year.

"Beautiful to watch, but not much of a story","Hollywood should NOT make films based on ancient stories. Because according to them, the story itself is not good enough as it is, and must be changed. Drastically.So while the plot is the same (Prince Paris of Troy takes the Queen of Sparta to be his wife, making the Kings of Greece attack them), Hollywood simply MUST change everything else in order to fit the American audience. Because really. If Achilles and Patroclus had been lovers instead of...cousins...*snorts* the film would have flopped as badly as Alexander did.But all things aside, the film is beautiful to watch. the soundtrack is beautiful, especially the song ""Remember Me"" by Josh Groban, that plays at the end credits. Eric Bana does an amazing job as Hector, Orlando Bloom looks very pretty as Paris, and although Brad Pitt could have done a much better job, he's pretty decent as the mighty Achilles.But loads of eye candy and great actors isn't enough to make a film; Hollywood needs to stay true to a story as famous as this one if they want to make a movie out of it! ...And I didn't know they had South American Llamas in Ancient Turkiye.... how embarrassing.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Missing some of the point of the movie.,"Putting aside the acting which I personally couldn't think of anyone doing a bad job. Peter O'Toole as King Priam was amazing and definitely god some of the best lines. Esp the scene when Priam went to see Achilles is heartbreaking on some part and ... well see it to understand the impact from the lines/words in the movies.Enjoy the entertainment that it is for, but not do not forget to see the many factors involved.I have watch the movie many times, and every time there is more that I didn't realize from the time before.Anyhow, personally suggest that keep an open mind and look beyond the beautiful actors, the beautiful scenery, the silly romance between the characters, one esp that leads to this war. Just as it was said in the movie ""Two worlds will go to war for honor and power. Thousands will fall in pursuit of glory. And for love, a nation will burn to the ground."" and the questionable existence of the ancient God's and Goddess but look at the heart breaking scene of men killing men, and then the end of men just killing every Trojan in sight. Greeks killing womyn, children (which somehow very few were shown in this movie but imagine that there too were being killed without mercy). All those for greed of power. E.g. Hector: You want me to look on your army and tremble? Well I see them. I see 50,000 men brought here to fight for one man's greed.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"To anybody that still wants to make a true ""Iliad"" movie","In an episode of an Italian comic book series ""Alan Ford"" (a franchise largely unknown outside Italy and former Yugoslavia), a character tells a ""real story"" behind Trojan War. In that rendition Helen was a wasteful woman who led her husband, king Menelaus, to a brink of bankruptcy. When a naive Paris came to an embassy and began flirting with her, Menelaus saw it as a salvation for his treasury and even provided a ladder and the boat for the couple on the night of their ""escape"" to Troy. Paris happily introduced Helen to Trojan court, but once they realized there's no amount that woman can't spend they set to send her back to Sparta. Upon that news Menelaus raised an army and besieged Troy in order to prevent them doing so.This is a humorous example of what happens when you take a mythological story and try to explain it through the means of common human behavior. Similar process occurred with the movie ""Troy"". The screenwriters chose to omit gods and supernatural influence that is the driving force of Iliad and went for an attempt to explain everything through ancient geopolitics and fight for power between protagonists.That is perfectly valid thing to do, from a historian point of view, because the legend of Trojan War did have its base on some historical war that took place there. But in that case it's hard to incorporate heroes (portrayed in myths as demigods) and their extraordinary deeds in the story, and heroes and their deeds are crucial part of Iliad and plethora of other Greek myths. Achilles couldn't be the greatest warrior without the help of invisible shield of river Styx around his body, Paris wouldn't have seduced Helen without the help of Aphrodite and Troy wouldn't seem so doomed without Zeus, Athena and Hera determined to bring it down.Of course, I have put things the other way around here. The Iliad and other stories did come after the actual war and gods were included as a sort of justification for the deed done. And great heroes of the war were immortalized and whatever they actually achieved in it was blown literally to mythical proportions. But, today, to translate Iliad verbatim to a big screen would make an interesting movie and certainly something people would want to see. There already were a pseudo- historical interpretation of the war filmed (or several of them), but never the actual poem and its surrounding apocryphal literature.As far as the real-life interpretations go, ""Troy"" was quite good and fair. One might say that the screenwriters actually pulled it off. Everything from Helen's kidnapping through characterizations of various protagonists to eventual resolution was quite convincing, even without the presence of divine. Two characters stand out and are given a large chunk of screen time - Agamemnon and Achilles. Agamemnon was rightfully portrayed as a greedy warmongering tyrant (whoever is willing to sacrifice his own daughter for a mere safe passage of his navy to Troy cannot be otherwise). Achilles was also quite on par as a reluctant hero tired of life of constant fighting. His weakness here doesn't come from legendary heel but from his death wish. All in all I felt satisfied with how the script dealt with the motivations throughout.The movie is largely well executed, the battles and fights spectacular and occasionally surprising, the dialog is often intelligent and poignant. Some things are not so good though. The music concept borrows heavily from ""Gladiator"" - how many times can we hear soothing female voice over a battle scene before it becomes corny? Also towards the end direction falls apart and the epilogue looks both rushed and cheap (as if the production ran out of both time and money). Overall ""Troy"" could have benefited from at least another extra hour and in the end it shows. Nevertheless, what we have here is a good piece of cinema, highly recommendable, better than many would acknowledge and certainly better than many recent movies of the sword and sandal genre. Yes, it's better than ""Gladiator"", so kill me. If anybody makes a new version with gods and powers, it will become sword and magic genre and I will be able to say it's better than ""Lords of the Rings"" in which case someone will kill me for sure.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Worst movie, ever.","I've been reading other comments on this movie and here's my 2 cents:This was by far one of the worst movies, ever. Period. They tried to make Brad Pitt another Charles Heston and that didn't work out for him considering this was not his best movie ever. Movies like Fight Club and Seven are where we see Pitt best... This movie makes me want to hit him.The acting was not all that great by any of the characters except for Hector. He I actually believed.The musical score blew beyond anything I've ever heard. It sort of reminded me of Gladiator but not nearly as good.The historical aspects of the movie are extremely far off. The clothing and such was mostly correct, but there are things that were never even mentioned in the movie that played a larger role in the book. As far as I remember, Achilles was killed before the Trojan horse was brought into the city and he was killed in the middle of a battlefield, not alone. It was Odysseus who played a much larger role in the Iliad in the creation of the horse. Patrocklus is Achilles lover, not his cousin, and Achilles was fully aware that Patrocklus took his armor into the battlefield... Patrocklus even furthered them in the battlefield until he was struck dead by Hector. The Iliad ends with Hectors burial whereas the movie does not. Helen was also kidnapped... She did not go willingly. She was a prize won by Paris granted by... I want to say Aphrodites but I forget if it was her or Hera or the other goddess competing for the golden apple. Where are the gods and goddesses in this movie? The only goddess we are made aware of his Achilles mother and I don't recall her even being mentioned as a goddess (although I could be wrong).I gave this movie a '1.' I wasn't aware that I went to see a comedy. This movie made me laugh all the way through. I especially loved Achilles ""signature move.""",1.0,Anonymous,History
Troy is not Zulu,"""Troy"" is a very disappointing, predictable, nonsensical spectacle. Two far better movies are ""Zulu"" (for spectacle and other values) and ""Walk in the Sun."" Also ""Apocalypse Now"" is far superior. These three films exemplify aspects of good film making that are missing from ""Troy,"" namely good acting, good plot, penetrating dialogue. ""Troy"" lacks an aesthetic. Peterson has trivialized Homer and ""The Iliad,"" a process expected, perhaps, as that is what movies do to their ""inspirations."" Nonetheless, it is not offensive to combine events from different ancient legends, but when the fundamentals of the story are distorted, the result is dramatic histrionics without substance. This movie is a litany of numerous flaws in such an ""action thriller"": faulty, superficial characterization, wooden or hammy acting, inane or platitudinous dialogue, gratuitous nudity, artificial complications, maudlin meandering, absurd costuming, vacuous facial expressions. ""Troy"" has spectacle, and great music, features appropriate to moldy bread and circuses. Ron Rehfeldt, Rockford, IL",,Anonymous,History
Troy is well worth seeing!,"Whilst the subject matter of this film has been around for some time and read by academics and students alike, make no mistake, this isn't Homer word for word. Having said that, Troy does stand on its own and does tell a tale of heroes long passed into myth and legend. It's not important that parts of the story were changed or even missing. This is a movie after all. Go read the poem I say to purists and critics. Visually stunning and with scenery fit to match, who couldn't fall under the captivating spell that Wolfgang Peterson has wrought. I for one will be seeing it again.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Troy,"Now then, where do we start? On the plus side, this is one of the more intelligent applications of CGI in an historical drama setting. The film delivers lots of epic grandeur; the at sea-scenes/battles are classily produced and the attention to detail across the costume and prop departments is outstanding. Sadly, though, the acting isn't at all joined up. At bit like the Dutch football team of the 1980s, we have lots of individual stars but relatively little cohesion between them. Peter O'Toole brings some gravitas as Priam, bit otherwise it's a loose collection of A-lister performances that try their best with a staccato script and some fairly clunky direction. As an end-to-end adventure film, it isn't as bad as it has been accused of being, but it definitely could have done with a deal more emphasis on the characterisation - Brian Cox is dreadful as Agamemnon; Brad Pitt (Achilles), and particularly Eric Bana (Hector) are shockingly wooden; Orlando Bloom (Paris) & Garrett Hedlund (Patroclus) appear there merely as eye-candy and Diane Kruger as the one who launched the thousand ships sounded more like Celine Dion every time she spoke. This is undoubtedly a story that could have made Cecil B De Mille proud, instead I suspect he's have nodded off...",6.0,Anonymous,History
excellent film,This is the first time i have reviewed a film so... I watched Troy yesterday and i am not ashamed to say I almost felt like crying at the end. The tragedy in this film is amazing. All these people dying for the love of 2 people. Eric Bana is incredible as Hector. Brad Pitt plays Achilles equally well. The fight scene between these 2 is very tense and sad. Achilles relationship with Rose Byrnes is very poignant and the fact he dies just when he reaches her adds to the story. Orlando Bloom plays Paris effectively showing his love for Helen. the fight scene between him and Menelaus is very revealing and shows how much of a coward Paris is. even though he does try to redeem himself at the end. Diane Kruger is beautiful as Helen and i could truly believe she was the face that launched a thousand ships! overall i would give this film a 10/10.,10.0,Anonymous,History
Just Eye Candy,"I thought Wolfgang Peterson directed good movies. That is until I saw Troy. Troy was highly anticipated by me, and not merely for the fact that Orlando Bloom, Brad Pitt, and Eric Bana were starring in it. I truly believed that this movie was going to be the next summer blockbuster like Gladiator was. I was mistaken. This movie played out like a mediocre soap opera. I know I have seen better television shows than this big screen, million dollar picture. Everything made it sink lower and lower than it should of. I have pinpointed some areas which needed drastic help to improve this movie:The Acting - How can Wolfgang Peterson be happy with the acting? The only good actor that carried the movie was Eric Bana. I was expecting more out of Brad Pitt, but he never seemed to deliver. And his emotional outburst at the beginning of the movie really bothered me. It hit too close to Russell Crowe in Gladiator. Also, why Orlando Bloom? He can not act beyond what he has done in previous movies. I now have to admit he is in movies just for eye candy. Nothing more.The Music - The score didn't play along with the time period of the movie.One minute it played heavy brass, and then switched to some mournful woman singing away (again, like Gladiator). The music made the movie cheesy. There was no great score to work with the film to make it better.Make-up - O.K., I know this is minor, but I couldn't focus on the dialogue when I had to stare at Diane's face with one eye done in make up and the other eye without any. Was that to add to the effect? I don't know. But it did happen more than once.Dialogue - Was this movie supposed to be funny? In many places I found that the characters humoured me. Why? Because the dialogue was cheesy and my 4 year old cousin could of come up with the lines.How could Peterson make such a horrible movie? I know it will bring in money because the teenage girls will flock in droves to see Pitt, Bloom and Bana on screen. That is really all this film has to offer. I wish I could of liked this film, but with nothing going for it but eye candy, I hated it.For all of you out there that want to see a popcorn movie, this is decent to see, but just don't expect too much.P.S. Don't give Orlando Bloom a bow and arrow ever again.",6.0,Anonymous,History
The Mythological Epic Returns,"From Wolfgang Petersen and a huge team of international film technicians and artists comes Troy, the latest chapter in the swords-and-sandals revival. Often debated for its distortion of the source material, Troy, to a modern blasé film audiences, often hides its qualities very well...Troy is a throwback to the mythology-inspired epics of yesteryear, despite certain contemporary touches that ground it in the new millennium. It owes less to Ridley Scott's Gladiator and more to ensemble epics like Spartacus. People who favor a classic good versus evil or a simple protagonist/antagonist model will be surprised, since, for the most part, the many characters on display are surprisingly developed and layered.Many of the players give out memorable performances: Brad Pitt goes against expectations with an often unlikable Achilles, but the film's real gravitational center is Eric Bana's Hector. Rose Byrne is given her first chance to really impress in a major release, and the other supporting roles - of the kind that were formerly given to actors such as Jack Hawkins, Alec Guiness, Anthony Quinn and Omar Shariff - shine thanks to seasoned pros having a ball: be it Peter O'Toole's touching King Priam, Sean Bean as Ulysses (worthy of his own self-contained film) and Brian Cox as a mad, warmongering Agamemnon. The only bum notes, casting and writing-wise, are the very bland Orlando Bloom and Diane Kruger as the love duo that sparked a massive war.Two things annoy and stop this from being a really good movie. First, the scale is sometimes ridiculous, and you get the feeling that one pull-back shot reveals way more CG ships that all the wood in Europe could have allowed, a sad symptom of having to measure up to the Lord of the Rings level of epic audiences have grown used to. Second, this is not Homer's Illiad, but rather an attempt to reconcile that epic tale with historical probability. The Gods play no part and the interpersonal dynamics have been adapted to a late 20th century audiences in ways that are at times more progressive (the women are fleshed out a bit more), and sometimes strangely puritanical (needless to say, any homosexual undertones or relationships from the source poem are completely redacted here).John Ford once said: ""When the legend becomes fact, print the legend"". Petersen and team have tried to blend the two, and the result, while not always successful, definitely has its moments and points of interest.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Troy boys,"Eh - not bad. I almost forgot how much I enjoyed the Iliad and the Aeneid when I was a strapping young teen of a more rebellious nature. This movie brought me back a bit and made me want to strap on a spear and some leather. Minor qualm: Brad Pitt mopes about like a Hollywood movie star who lost his crayons. Greek heroes don't mope - they kick ass - and Greek ass to boot! Then they listen to cheering and eat and have lots of sex. There is some ass-kicking and sex and cheering but Brad's Achilles is too brooding and moody. The FX are pretty good, I liked the launch of 1000 ships. Peter O'Toole looks like he was happy to be surrounded by so many young boys again like in Lawrence of Arabia - his scene was good. Orlando Bloom plays a good Paris. Best of all is Eric Bana as Hector, who would've been better in the Pitt role. I could've done without the stupid 'reaction' shots - 50000 men on a field and Helen and Priam can see Menaleus and Paris fighting through all of them? Dumb. All and all, ""eh, not bad"".

have they no honor??,"I had the greatest enthusiasm going in to the advance screening for this movie. After all, this is one of the oldest and most complex tales known to mankind, and it was one of the first epic tales I read as a kid (even before Tolkien). I must say that IT WAS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. They completely made the plot into a joke and turned the thing into one long soap opera. The elements that WERE faithful to the plot were sprinkled throughout in such a haphazard manner that the audience was laughing at many times at the silly script that just paid lip service to this battle of all battles. It was a huge disappointment to see a complex character like Achilles (who has a strange combination of nearly Matrix-like powers, utter ruthlessness and male lovers in the original poem) turn to ""Fabio on the beach"" in the guise of Pitt (who with a good script and more effort could have turned this into the most complex and original warrior figure Hollywood has ever produced). The actors were actually decent, trying to make the best of a ridiculous script. It was actually a waste of so much talent (Peter O'Toole stole the show, and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean were pathetic). Compare it to LOTR or Gladiator and it doesn't even hold a candle to them. Plenty of hunks for the ladies to goggle over but not enough battle scenes for a movie that is about one long battle and siege. I wouldn't recommend that anyone pay to see this story dragged through the dirt like one of the characters was (at least they got that part right).",1.0,Anonymous,History
emotion,"i have just read the summary on troy. the person that wrote that review on troy had it in for the film from the start because the talk of lack of emotion throughout the film was rubbish. if you watch the film you can clearly see a deep sense of emotion for example when the king of troy and achilles meet in achilles tent because the king wanted his sons dead body back it was so touching when the king kissed achilles hands saying ""i have done the hardest thing a man can do i have kissed the hands of the man that has killed my son"". you cannot say that that whole scene was not touching and another part that is full of emotion is at the end where achilles has just saved polydora from king triopas he more or less tells her he loves her when Paris comes and shoots him dead he says ""you gave me peace in a lifetime of war"" no one can say that that was not an emotional scene because you could tell that polydora and achilles loved each other. if you go and watch the film i think that you will agree that at certain parts there is deep emotion and it will pull at your heart strings.",,Anonymous,History
Troy,"I have just finished viewing the movie Troy for my first time and I enjoyed watching it. Greek mythology is not my favorite subjects and I thought the movie would be boring. However, to my surprise it was not and I was actually drawn into the movie. I can even say that I learned more information in a shorter period of time watching the movie than reading the story. The movie was very interesting and I would definitely watch it again if I had the chance. The best part of the movie for me would have had to be when Achilles and Hector were battling in a one on one combat and Achilles triumphed. After winning, Achilles took Hector's body and dragged him back to his tent. Later that evening Priam entered Achilles tent dressed a large rob. He then kissed Achilles' hand and stated that he has done what no man has done before; kiss the hands of the man who killed my son. After, Priam begs Achilles to give his son back to him and after some consideration, Achilles does so. I choose this scene because this was the scene that my class had discussed about in school and I was very confused and lost. But after watching the movie I can say that I now know exactly what my teacher was talking about and will now be able to participate in discussions if more were to arise. The worst part of the movie would have to be when Patroclus was killed in a one to one combat with Hector. I disliked that part of the movie because Patroclus died at a very young age and would have not died if Hector had known that he was not Achilles. But due to ambiguous identity Patroclus lost his life. Because Patroclus lost his life Hector lost his as well. This is because after Achilles found out that his cousin, Patroclus had been killed by Prince Hector Achilles wanted revenge. Not thinking about why Prince Hector would kill Patroclus he took action. Achilles did not think the information given to him thoroughly; he acted on anger and rage. If he had sit down to hear the information, Hector had thought that Patroclus was Achilles. But because Achilles was stubborn he fought Hector in a one to one combat and Hector fell. All this bloodshed happened because Patroclus wanted to fight in the war and wore Achilles' armor. This could have been prevented and two lives would have been saved if Patroclus had listened to Achilles when he said he was not ready for combat. The movie was excellent and I really enjoyed watching it. It gave a new meaning to the story Troy and I now understand what is going on. The movie was very easy to follow and understand. There were no unclear parts where I thought to myself, ""What's going on."" I think that the actors portrayed their characters very well and did an excellent job and the director with his cast and crew worked very hard and put a wonderful movie together. This was an excellent movie and I wish I had seen it right when it was being previewed in the movie theaters.

A Flawed But Entertaining Epic,"I've never really understood the immense hatred that Troy received. Even in a year where we had failed epics like King Arthur and the atrocious ""Alexander,"" people still considered this to be a terrible attempt at adapting Homer's The Iliad. While I certainly agree that the movie could have fixed a few things, I can't help but have a lot of fun every time I watch this.The biggest thing I loved about this movie was that it felt like a tribute to the epic sword and sandals movies of the 50s and 60s. Everything from the sets, costume design, and even the running time of the movie screams epic. There are incredible battle sequences that never seize to amaze, and Brad Pitt does a good job playing the almost invincible hero Achilles. Even when the movie was at its downtime, I was still invested in its characters and story.The actors all do an excellent job. As I mentioned, Brad Pitt does a very good job, and definitely fills the presence of an unstoppable fighter. Eric Bana does a great job as Hector, and Peter O'Toole almost steals the show as King Priam, for the little bit that he is in the movie. I also really liked the performances of Rose Byrne as Bruseis and Sean Bean as Odysseus.And like I said, everything technical about this movie is stunning. The sets, particular those set in Troy, are beautiful to look at, and you can definitely see the attention to detail there as well as in the costume and weapon design. The musical score by James Horner is pretty good, though it can feel a little too bombastic at times (there is a loud female shout every once and a while). And the action sequences are perfectly choreographed and entertaining on many levels.Unfortunately we do have to touch on where the movie gets it wrong, and largely it seems to stumble when it comes to its dialogue. A lot of the dialogue here does come off a little clichéd and cheesy, and some of the actors aren't able to live up to their co-stars. Orlando Bloom, for example, seems like he is struggling to show himself as intimate and a boy in love, which may be because of how he's gain this persona as a elf warrior badass from Lord Of The Rings. Diane Kruger is a little stale as Helen, and sometimes Brian Cox feels a little over the top in his acting. Some of the death scenes also come off a little awkward, particularly the aftermath of Paris and Menelaus' one on one battle.Still, while these flaws are prevalent, Troy still is able to succeed due to its attention to artistic detail, entertaining action sequences, and solid actors whose characters we can connect with and enjoy watching. As far as epics go, this one isn't among the Bravehearts and Ben-Hurs of the world, but it still is better than a lot of the more recent epic action films we've seen as of late. I recommend checking this one out.",7.0,Anonymous,History
The Movie of the Year,"I watched Troy twice and I'm gonna have to say that I haven't had enough. I'll probably watch it 2 more times. I am seriously Infatuated with this movie. And Brad Pitt is definitely the meaning of BEAUTIFUL. I love the time period the movie took us back to, the Trojan War, the era, the feeling and aura of the whole movie. I realized that I am not infatuated with Brad Pitt. But I am infatuated with Achilles and his love for Briseis.There was a big commotion on how over-budgeted this movie was. Sure, it definitely was. But whatever Director Wolfgang Peterson wanted the audience to grasp thru TROY, he definitely succeeded. I feel fulfilled by the movie. No not in a sexual way. The movie fulfilled me in a deeper way that is difficult to explain in words. Its more of a inner feeling that probably only a few can share with me. I feel that the movie can tie in any theme possible if u dig deep, its definitely a timeless flick. Wolfgang Petersen is a genius. I will watch the film a couple more times just to grasp a deeper understanding on what emotions, feelings, morals, etc. my peers and I feel on the spectacular film. As I depart, I just want to state that the movie had a huge impact on me as of right now and probably years to come. I definitely think its the movie of the year.

Performances as Wooden as the Trojan Horse!,"After screening this film, I have to tell it like it is. I found myself struggling not to giggle at many parts of this movie. The script is laughable with lines no actor should have to utter and no movie patron should have to hear.I personally think that the biggest mistake made with this movie is with the casting. Brad Pitt is seriously out of his league in his role of Achilles. I think he was cast for the appearance of his buttocks more than anything else. Diane Kruger as Helen of Troy?? This is the classic beauty that ""launched a thousand ships?"" Who the hell is she first of all? Orlando Bloom is also miscast in the role of Paris. Eric Bana as Hector is also a bit of a stretch but a better fit than the others previously mentioned.The second mistake was with the script. Terrible lines that made me want to smirk...in fact I did smirk, many times. Thankfully I passed on the popcorn this time, as there is enough corn in this movie to feed a herd of cattle.I have to agree that much of the CGI was not impressive. The overall feel of the film is lacking. It does not have that Epic atmosphere about it, and personally, seeing it once is enough. I cannot imagine suffering through it again on DVD.My most memorable scene in this movie was the person two rows in front of me checking their indiglo watch over and over and over and....OVER again. That simple scene says it all about Troy. Two hours and forty minutes you will never get back!Any movie that has to change the content of a Greek Classic is a tragedy.

This will be the worst movie the world will ever see!!!!,"I'm asking all others who have viewed this ""epic"" to join me in arms and help others in saving their minds by not seeing this movie. Nothing. Nothing was good about it. Well, maybe one thing. It was so bad from the opening title on, that I was actually able to leave forty minutes into the movie, and save myself somewhat. And I was denied my refund. Why does an ancient Greek king, Menelaos, speak with a Scotish accent? Why does Priam, king of Troy, prey to Rah, the Egyptian sun god? Why is Agamemnon, a great warrior, so fat? Why is Odysseus, the great mariner, the last one on the beach? This movie is bad writing, on top of bad acting, on top of bad editing, on top of bad directing. I was hoping this movie would be great, and go down as one of my favorite movies to watch. Now it tops the list as my favorite movie to protest. To the great author Homer, I can only offer an apology from me, for living in the same time period as the people who made this movie. I would have more to criticize about this film, but I couldn't take any more after the taking of the beach. These heroes have been wronged, and so has anyone who has seen this...this....AAAAHHHHH!!!!! I hate this movie!!!!",1.0,Anonymous,History
"Good piece of entertainment, lighten up!","Warning, a little bit of spoiling below.A good, watchable piece of entertainment. There are plenty of great historical poets who have written of Troy, and most of us have a vague muddle of their story lines glued together when we think of Troy. So what if the film is not faithful to the Iliad? Makes you wonder if Virgil got a pasting in his day for re-interpreting it. Probably not, the Internet allows even the most ignorant or anal of opinions loud voice (even mine).I think Petersen made a good call by reducing the role of the gods in the story, it seemed to me that you could see the myths being born, the godly games invented to explain the tragedy by a master storyteller (Homer) living hundreds of years after these alleged events.I was a little annoyed that the film compressed the siege of Troy to what seemed a month or so, and also the scale of the battles seemed to be intended to inspire the awe of the LOTR, yet the number of combatants would more likely have been on the scale of a big football crowd... Say 50,000 for the Greeks and less than that for the Trojans, but again, does it really matter?For me, I felt the doom of Hector, and King Priam's loss keenly. One of Peter O'Toole's finest scenes ever. I defy anyone who has children not to be moved by that.But in all the hype and acid being flung at the film, I have to say I adored Rose Byrne as Briseis.

uneven though sometimes rewarding film,"Wolfgang Peterson's ""Troy"" is an attempt to recapture the look and feel of those sword-and-sandal epics of the 1950's and 1960's - those multi-million dollar, wide screen extravaganzas that helped lure audiences away from their television sets at home and back into the movie houses they had so recently abandoned. As is to be expected, ""Troy"" shares many of the strengths as well as many of the weaknesses of those earlier films.On the positive side, ""Troy"" provides us with the pleasure of watching history (or pseudo-history in this case) unfolding on a grand scale with events greater than ourselves being enacted on the screen. It also boasts spectacular battle sequences with thousands of extras (or the computerized equivalent thereof) stretching back as far as the eye can see. On the negative side, the movie suffers from over length, corny dialogue and banal characters who frequently get lost on the vast canvas of the film. The good news is that, for the most part, ""Troy"" manages to triumph over most of its weaknesses.""Troy"" is based very loosely on ""The Iliad,"" the epic poem by the Greek writer, Homer. So loose is it, in fact, that the screenplay dispenses completely with the gods and goddesses who play so crucial a role in the original tale and, instead, concentrates exclusively on the humans who are left on their own to act out the drama. Those characters read like a Who's Who of great mythological figures. On the Greek side, we have Achilles, the pouty warrior who sits out most of the fighting because he feels personally slighted by the king who doesn't appreciate him the way he should; Agamemnon, the arrogant chieftain who is more concerned with personal glory than with doing what is right; Menelaus, the impulsive cuckold who has no compunction about taking his nation to war over a personal humiliation; Odysseus, the pragmatic fighter who tries his hardest to get Achilles to see the error of his ways; and Patroclus, the impetuous youth eager to prove his mettle and his devotion to Achilles on the field of battle. Lined up on the Trojan side are Hector, the sensitive tactician; Priam, the wise king and loving father of Hector and Paris; Paris, the callow youth; and Helen, the world's most beautiful woman, for whose sake the epic battle is ultimately fought. In fact, it is Paris' ""abduction"" of Helen from her Greek husband, Menelaus, that inspires that nation to launch a thousand ships, cross the sea to the fortified city of Troy, and do battle with the Trojans.Because of the quality of the source material, ""Troy"" boasts a slightly more complex and conflicted hero than we are used to finding in action/adventure films. For even though he is reputed to be the world's most invincible warrior, Achilles is also petulant and spoiled, quick to anger and often more concerned with amending personal injuries than with safeguarding the welfare of his own countrymen. The squaring off between the two bitter rivals, Achilles and Hector - two men who, under different circumstances, might have been the best of friends - is excitingly well done and suspenseful. Ditto for the scene in which a mourning King Priam slips into the tent of his enemy to beg for the body of his son. On the other hand, Achille's love affair with the Trojan ""war prize"" Breseis emerges as pure Hollywood hokum. And poor Agamemnon has become far more of a conventional villain in this version than he is in ""The Iliad."" Although the screenplay stays relatively faithful to the broad outlines of ""The Iliad""'s storyline and characters, it can't duplicate the beauty and soul of Homer's poetic verse. The closest the writers seem to be able to come is having the characters repeat over and over again to one another that men for thousands of years will still be speaking of Achilles, Hector, Troy, et. al. and the events in which they are engaged. All this pretentious, self-reverential speechifying merely succeeds in throwing us out of the drama every time someone utters one of those ""prophetic"" lines.Brad Pitt, Orlando Bloom, Brian Cox, Eric Bana, Diane Kruger, Rose Byrne and Sean Bean round out the cast, but it is the veteran actor Peter O'Toole who, as Priam, delivers the one truly compelling performance. It's also nice to see Julie Christie in a movie again, although her role as the sea nymph, Thetis, Achilles' mother, is too inconsequential for her to have much of an impact.""Troy"" is little more than an Illustrated Highlights version of ""The Iliad,"" but for those unfamiliar with the work, it serves as a decent enough introduction for those willing to take on the real thing.",6.0,Anonymous,History
***Thumbs up!***,"I have always been fascinated by Greek History, and this movie is the best that I have seen on the topic. I think the movie is excellent, especially compared to most of the movies that have been shown recently. All areas are not altogether accurate, however, the general idea was presented well. My husband who has never read anything, seen anything or even cared about the matter, after seeing the movie, was able to relay the 'big picture' of what really happened during those days.I confess, however, that my only hesitation in viewing this film was because Brad Pitt was one of the actors. I have never really liked his acting in past (except for Legends of the Fall . . . which I only recently watched as well.) To my surprise, and enjoyment, Brad Pitt was phenomenal! He was able to portray a very confused, tormented, yet heroic Achilles very well indeed. There was very little left to be desired in the acting of this character. And how could anyone not be impressed by the skills used int he fight scenes. Again, Brad was phenomenal! He was good shape and form, and he showed that he could easily play an heroic figure. When I compare him with Tom Cruise in 'The Last Samurai' or Russell Crowe in 'Gladiator', Brad simply comes out shining. He has won my respect through this movie. Hats off to you, Brad!Eric Bana also did an excellent job in his character. In fact, I would say that he portrayed his character better than any other in the movie. His character was the most believeable, and that's because he played it so well. My favorite scene with him was when Paris comes to him while they were on the ship sailing back to Troy from Sparta. Paris reveals that he has Helen on the ship, and Hector goes ballistic! In this scene one can easily see what Hector's life was about . . . protecting Troy at all costs. I liked the speech he gave to Paris about war and death and that ""there is nothing glorious about it, nothing poetic."" Eric has always been a good actor, but he has really taken his acting to another level in this movie. He was able to portray love, anger, fear, courage, and some other emotions and attributes that are so real. Everyone should love Eric in this film!Everyone else in the movie did well, and contrary to what some are saying, I do believe that Orlando Bloom did justice to Paris. Paris is really not a 'likeable' character to play. Because of his inability to control himself, these two great cities were at war. So at the very beginning, you have no choice but to hate him. In spite of that, Orlando played his part well.I would recommend this movie to all of my friends and acquaintances because it really is a balanced movie. Thats more than I can say for most. I believe that it's going to win many awards this year!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Troy relishes in lavish epic battles and set pieces but has all the depth of blood-soaked sand.,"Having seen the theatrical version, I thought to give the director's cut an opportunity at winning me over. Totalling at a gargantuan 196 minutes, the additional 30 minutes of swords and sandals certainly justify the elongated runtime. But alas, even with all the blood and guts, it's hindered by a lacklustre screenplay. Loosely based on Homer's epic poem Iliad, depicting the Trojan War and the sack of Troy, which happens to be Homer's second poem Odyssey. A war of powerful greed, lustful pride and embellishing love, the Trojan War is one of the most famous wars in Greek Mythology. Director Petersen manages to convey the central theme of immortality through vivid battles and ultimatums, with little assistance from Benioff's screenplay. The sheer lack of characterisation, particularly from Paris and Achilles, resulted in a monotonous story about honour. There was no emotion. Understandably it is a period war epic and so the sprawling battles take precedent, and they are entertainingly violent. But when so much time is spent establishing these characters and the relationships between them, you would've thought some emotional resonance should've naturally transpired. Acting was functional, mostly focusing on the physicality of their roles, with Pitt and Bana being the standouts. The duel between Hector and Achilles remains one of the most engrossing battles put to film. The inventive sword and shield choreography was outstanding. Despite having wealthy mythological source material, Benioff managed to make several changes that lead me questioning particular choices, especially condensing a decade long war to a mere week or two. Being a fan of Greek Mythology, I found it difficult to believe certain aspects. Some characters died when they shouldn't have, romances bloomed that didn't exist. Yet, for mainstream audiences that are uninitiated with such backgrounds, this remains a well paced action epic with visceral violence and a solid cast. Just don't expect an honest translation of Homer's poem.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Okay Summer Movie,"Troy was okay as a summer movie and it is only a good movie if you judge by summer movie standards. I did go in expecting more substance than say the movie, Van Helsing, because it is based on a much revered work. The characterizations and script lack the depth of a movie like The Gladiator. Nonetheless, it works as a summer movie and occasionally injects heart here and there.  I initially had problems with the casting but everyone did an adequate job.  What is ironic is that is it not Helen and Paris' romance that you begin to care about.  It is the romance between Achilles and Briseis that you really root for.  That was unexpected.  I think Rose Byrne in addition to Eric Bana were the reasons why I stuck with this movie. I predict big things in the future for Byrne and Bana. They have true star appeal. Brad Pitt was better in the role than I expected.  I initially had problems imagining him as Achilles but he pulled it off.  I admire Bloom for taking a role that displays Paris initially as being so weak. I think he did fine in the role. Of course side characters such as Peter O'Toole as the king of Troy was exceptional. O'Toole doesn't even need to say a word, his eyes do all the acting... 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,History

Did this do poorly at the box office?,"I thought I heard somewhere that this movie was a box office bomb or did poorly financially. It became infamous or something. I must have been thinking about the movie ""Alexander"". I was also reminded of ""300"" while watching this. How many movies featuring loosely based historical battles were there made at this time? Anyway, I guess I'm not that familiar with the Illiad and I'm not even sure how factual it is. Then again, this didn't have any supernatural stuff, so it seemed pretty realistic to me. I admit that a flaw of this was that it was a bit too long.It seemed to take way too long for the famous Trojan horse to appear. It's still a good movie. It's odd how a fair number of critics didn't like it even though Leonard Maltin gave it three and a half stars. Good for you, Leonard! What I love about this movie is how epic it is. We get such wonderfully detailed battle scenes. I think my favorite part would be when they shoot these flaming arrows and then throw boulders that are engulfed with fire at their enemies! Most of this movie is just dialogue and fighting. It's still good because the acting is nice and it's a beautiful film to just look at. ***",7.0,Anonymous,History
This is not the story of Troy! This is fast food!,"Take it from someone who read Homeros original ""Illiade"" and knows a little something about Greek myths and legends - the movie is crap.1. Cast - a British Orlando Bloom as an Eastern Trojan prince? All of the actors were chosen only because they're on top of their carriers. All of them but Peter O'Tool. He was a veteran surrounded by amateurs. And that Krueger-chick is a lame travesty for a Helen of Troy.2. The plot - I will not tell the story considering those who haven't seen the movie, but one thing just must be said - IT IS NOT HOW THE LEGEND GOES. Peterson changed it all, he made the story average and DRY. He took away that little something, that not only makes the story epic but also intriguing.3. Gods - WHERE ARE THEY? If the movie was based on a true story (that probably happened some thousand years ago) no gods would be needed, but it is based on a Homer's epic poem where gods were the ones who carried the story. THEY WERE THE REASON TO EVERYTHING and played a very big part in the development of the war and people. Without them the story became so dry it was painful to watch.Yeah, it was painful to watch, what Peterson did to the story, and that people actually like it. It ruined Brad Pitt for me, before I even got to now his movies better :(And even if we drop Homer and legends and all this, the movie - the movie itself (acting, casting, war scenes, lines...) is bad. It's just a bad movie. Pitt is stale and woodsy, Krueger's only plus is that she's young and Bloom is none.If you want an entertainment antique saga which is both entertaining and faithful watch Homer Simpsons ""Odessy"" (with Agness Skinner as Helen of Troy :)",1.0,Anonymous,History
3.5 stars,"First of all, there are no 'gods' in Troy so don't expect them. The story is quite good without them however, if you can just say 'cinematic license' and get over it. Brad Pitt does a credible job as a sensitive Achilles, but also an Achilles that knows that what's most important to him is glory and renown. The young boy that plays Patroclus (in the film he is Achilles cousin, not his lover) is very good and looks enough like Pitt that you believe they are related. Of course, He is, along with Achilles and Helen, one of only 3 blonde-haired people in the movie! Brad is beautifully buffed and we get to see most of that, so if you are female that is very good.Sean Bean (Boromir from Fellowship of the Ring) does a nice job as Odysseus, even if his hair looks too modern and his heavy Yorkshire accent is distracting.Helen -- oh dear, she can't act and her accent slips into heavy German rather than the cultured British it's supposed to be more times than not!Eric Bana does a spectacular Hector and Peter O'Toole - well, even at his advanced age, he is still Peter O'Toole, brilliant as Priam and heart wrenching in a scene where he pleas for Achilles to let him bring Hector back inside the walls of Troy for a proper burial. I admit I cried and I was pleased with the way Achilles seemed to admire and even fear this frail old man, while knowing that he could kill him with one blow. O'Toole is worth seeing.Orlando Bloom... since I loved him in Lord of the Rings, it wrenches my heart to say that in 'Troy' his facial expressions were horribly over acted. Did the director not view the rushes? If so, he should have told Bloom to turn it down, especially during some of his scenes with Helen. I was also not prepared to see him clinging to Hector's knees begging for life after running away from a hand to hand combat with Menelaus! To be honest, this Paris is a selfish, spoilt little rich prince who has been coddled by his family and knows nothing about courage or honor. It makes one wonder at Helen choosing him at all - even if he is very beautiful. Yes, Bloom looks pretty, who could deny that? But he has much to learn about acting. His saving graces for me seemed to be the opening body shot with Helen where we get to see him standing next to the bed, near naked and damp with sweat, and when he finally takes up a bow and arrow and reminds me of Legolas. It seems he's retained his archery skills from Lord of the Rings - a perfect stance, a beautiful pull to the corner of his mouth and a deadly release... but all that only serves to make you wonder why Paris couldn't use any other weapon well and why, when his brother and countrymen were going to war over his folly - he wasn't obliged to fight.Worth seeing once at a matinee price - if only for the gorgeous choreographed battle with Pitt and Bana, the marvelous acting of O'Toole, and the scantily clad man-flesh. If none of these appeal to you, wait for the DVD.",,Anonymous,History
Directing was horrendous - movie was OK,"Honestly, some parts had people laughing way too much.Not to mention that there were really choppy cuts between scenes.  The back and forth dialogue was really just pathetic, and even the battle scenes were really weakened by the directing. Also, some of the lines were delivered pretty badly.  Orlando Bloom was definitely not at his best. I would say that this was a pretty good movie, but considering the budget, it certainly ranks well below other massive epic expenses like Gladiator or Braveheart. In addition, let's just say this was a much looser interpretation of the Iliad than I expected.  I'm not really complaining about that though.",6.0,Anonymous,History

I can handle inaccuracy but I draw the line at Achilles being straight,"I like this movie a great deal because of its action set pieces-the Hector/Achilles duel is the best scene in the film-and because of its production values. The film has a grand scope. There's a bluntness to everything-the writing, the machismo of the performances, the sets and costumes. Etc. Everything is just so brawny. If nothing else the film is engaging because it is loud and grabs your attention. I am however not overly fond of the script.The script works well enough to not sink the movie entirely but it's too Hollywood, too streamlined to capture the essence of the Iliad. It's also a fairly stupid and predictable piece of writing. Many of the changes the scripts makes-i.e. Removing the Gods and moments of divine intervention-are understandable and even defendable in the abstract.But it is both idiotic and loathsome that Patroclus was straightwashed into merely being Achilles' cousin. They are lovers and Achilles' final actions are driven by a lover's grief. In the film because the supporting relationship is missing makes Achilles a complete jerk and way too much a drama queen. The brutality shown towards Hector is only understandable as cold revenge. If the film wasn't willing to keep the Achilles-Patroclus love story intact much *much* more of a close kinship needed to be demonstrated. At the very least Patroclus should have been made Achilles' brother in the film's text. (They already changed so much what's one more thing?)I don't know why the script straightwashes this aspect. It is probably the studio lacking a backbone. But it might have been Pitt not wanting to play a gay man. Whatever the case it is a major problem in the final film.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Not Your Father's Illiad,"This is a very different interpretation of the Illiad than any I've seen.Gone are the meddling gods; this is a war between men. And it is fought for greed, honor, and religious fanaticism--not entirely unlike the war we're fighting today. Achilles and Hektor are no longer pawns on the chessboard of the gods, but two noble heroes fighting each other for ignoble causes.This allows Achilles to finally become sympathetic to the modern audience.(And as much as it makes me grind my teeth to admit it, Brad Pitt did an excellent job.)It takes a lot of cajones to change the greatest masterpiece in the history of mankind, but the changes they made were, in most cases, necessary for the sensical abridgement of the story or to explain things without using the gods. In all cases, the changes were extremely respectful to the original.Gone is Achilles hiding in a dress. Gone is Patrocles as the lover in exchange for Patrocles as the ward (which humanizes Achilles greatly). Gone is Briseis as mere war-trophy. She is transformed by a compelling actress and a vital role in the story. And thank Apollo, gone too is the profound injustice the Illiad does Hektor's courage.Unfortunately, also gone is the most recognizable and poignant scene of the Illiad--Hektor, his son, and his helmet. It is not quite made up for by the poignant scene of Priam in Achilles' tent. But Peter O'Toole does a masterful job there at realizing the undercurrent of the real Achilles story--this is, after all, where Achilles grows up.The eye-candy in this movie is extraordinary, and I'm not talking about Brad Pitt's butt. Looking at the Greek ships from the walls of Troy is a heart-stopping visual. The war scenes are wonderful. The confrontation between Achilles and Hektor is quite good. I'm not sure why the critics have chosen this movie to gripe about 'boredom' with computer generated scenes--perhaps we should blame Van Helsing.Yes, there are special effects and CGI, but it doesn't lose its focus, and the sight of Troy is a beautiful one. Hektor's fighting seems mortal next to Achilles', but Achilles himself does not seem a God. It is a glorious fight scene.Nothing can really be done to make Helen or Paris sympathetic, but blame Homer for that. There's also the moment when Paris is shooting arrows, and you suddenly think, ""It's Legolas!"" For that you can blame the casting director. There is also the brief, eye-roll inducing, guest-appearance of Aenaes.Purists may be disappointed in this movie, but historians and general movie-goers needn't be. It is a valiant effort and a respectful ode to Homer.It actually attempts to answer the question: 'What was the Trojan war _really_ about and what was really behind the Achilles hero-worship'. It offers a thoroughly banal and Hollywood answer--but it at least tries to answer the question.Most significantly, this movie does the impossible for the modern audience: it makes the Illiad Achilles' story again, not Hektor's. As classics majors everywhere know, that's no mean feat.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Some swords-and-sandals entertainment.,"Loads of high-adrenaline entertainment that was put together brilliantly on screen in some of the best choreographed battles in cinematic history. Was it just me, or did Kruger have a different accent in every scene? Plus...just a really awful performance on every level, though I think the same applies to Bloom. Other than that I thought acting-wise it was pretty well done, particularly from the beautiful Rose Byrne. Eric Bana and Brad Pitt were very intense and perfectly embodied the legendary soldiers that were superior to entire armies. The film was a little...overexaggerated (which was a good and bad quality, depending on the situation) even when it comes to the grand war that it was and some of the dialogue is too cheesy to stand for the most part. The choreography was beautiful, and I found a morbidly poetic sensation during the invasion of Troy. Perhaps the thousands of soldiers silently charging across the sand gave me this feeling. The ideas of getting rid of the Gods direct involvement and making Achilles an unstoppable badass added a lot to the film, especially in terms of entertainment which seemed to be Petersen's main priority (if it wasn't, then uh oh).",7.0,Anonymous,History
A War about the Beauty of a Woman -- Still told 3200 Years Later.,"Wolfgang Petersen has made a true match for ""Das Boot"" (1981). Give him a serious war and he will give you a serious film. This is the shortest 163 minute movie I have ever seen.Perhaps a little short on the Iliad legend, the movie carries a lot of punch. From a film full of stars, three excel. Peter O'Toole gives Priam one of his best performances in the last 20 years -- since his Oscar nominated role in ""My Favorite Year"" (1982). His scene with Brad Pitt pleading for the body of Hector is pure power.Brad Pitt as Achilles brings back memories of Kirk Douglas as another doomed hero in ""Spartacus"" (1960). Am I really comparing Brad Pitt to Kirk Douglas? Unlike the wacky Jeffrey Goines character in ""Twelve Monkeys"" (1995), this hero had to be fleshed out. I felt his disdain for Brian Cox's Agamemnon, his camaraderie with Sean Bean's tricky Odysseus, his rage with Eric Bana's Hector, and eventually his compassion and tenderness with Priam are more push than I have ever seen him give.The personal hit with me was Eric Bana's Hector. This pivotal role was fleshed out in the finest heroic tradition. To my reading, Hector is the true unsung hero of the Trojan war who is overwhelmed by events and super heroes. This film makes the dedication and heroism clear. Bana does a knock down job.I have singled out these few of the many stars of the film. Cheers has to be given to Wolfgang Petersen for finding the performances from so many competing egos.There is a lot of combat, but nothing like Saving Private Ryan (1998). This was war fought by warriors, not soldiers. Even the weakness shown by Achilles in his revenge against Hector is restored to strength in his chivalry towards Priam.There are a few bare asses, but nothing to stop the kids from seeing this harshly ""R"" rated movie. Eating a heart would have been an interesting ""R"" touch -- but omitted in this film. This is a classic movie about a classic legend.I give the movie a 10 for action, story, direction and stars.My only disappointment was the cinematography and effects. Perhaps it was a hard movie to film due to the logistics, but I would have hoped for more in this area.- Michael",10.0,Anonymous,History

There are no sides to root for in this film and that is why it is a great and in a way original film because war is pointless and humanity's dark nature. There is no point to comparing it to Braveheart and Gladiator becuause they were completely different movies about different subject matter and did not play as anti war films.

The summers biggest... disappointment?,"TROY (2004) *** Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Brian Cox, Brendan Gleeson, Sean BeanThere are movies of epic proportion, and there are epics; this movie tries to be a movie of epic proportion based on Homers epic  The Iliad. Sadly it fails.Certainly its eye-catching, there's plenty to look at and lots going on, but when you cut through the glitz, when you look for the acting', TROY runs out of steam.Peter O'Toole, though brave to take on such a role at his age, delivers a performance worthy of a television soap opera, not a massive budget `block-buster'. His performance alone damages the film almost beyond redemption. Not since Jeremy Irons, in his role as Profion in `Dungeons & Dragons (2000' has such over-acting been forced on a paying audience. Then there's Brian Cox, usually a quality actor in every role I've seen him in, yet the megalomaniacal delivery of his role as Agamemnon is even a bit too over-the-top for such a famous sociopath.One of the questions I found myself asking, even after leaving the movie, was this `Can Orlando Bloom actually play a role other than Legolas? And if so, when is he going to start?Kudos go out to Brendan Gleeson who gives a solid performance and demonstrates his versatility in yet another role. Sean Bean continues to demonstrate why he's in such high demand, but the real star of this movie is Eric Bana. Relatively unknown (at least in North America) prior to his role in `Hulk (2003)', Bana steals the show with his performance as Hector.Brad Pitt, typically, is spot on with his performance, and should not be discounted as the Lead. His solid portrayal of the chaotic Achilles makes up, at least in part, for the shortcomings of others.The fight choreography is spectacular, the score is breathtaking and the costuming and props are stunning. It's quite likely they'll get Oscar nods in these areas and stand a good chance at winning. Sadly, however, I'm sure the academy will consider O'Toole for a nomination just because he's been in the game so long. The prospect of that reviles me and if he were to actually win an academy award, where Ian McKellen failed to garner one for his role in `Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings (2001)', my faith in the entire voting process for the Oscars would collapse once and for all.Of course I'm sure the film will take in massive box office receipts and won't disappoint many, but given the hype I was expecting a lot more. At least the DVD will allow you skip over the many, many skippable sections.The only way you could get me to see this film again, in a non-matinee/cheap day setting, would be to sneak me into the theatre in a giant wooden horse.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Troy gets a 10 ,it was brilliant.","I give full points to Wolfgang Peterson for making such a tremendous movie.This is one of the films which allow us to see the kind of talent that the actors and actresses of our time posses.It was so beautiful the way that each actor transformed in the parts they played in that era,which was marked 3200 years ago. Brad Pitt and Rose Byrns were excellent .The other characters all did their parts to bring this film together.I have seen this film many times ,and each time I see it I find something new to love about each character.The themes in this show were brilliant ,especially since one man's glory and doom walk hand in hand.It is very hard to choose a best actor or actress in this film since they each got a rating of TEN from me.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"Amazing film, great performances, an overall great epic!","I don't understand people who think that the movie was bad because it wasn't true to the Illiad. Here is what it said: *Inspired* by the Illiad.I thought the movie was amazing. They made it deeper than just a war movie. I like that this movie actually had character development.The battle scenes were done perfectly, it's worth seeing only if you want to see Achilles(Brad Pitt) fight.Now for the acting: I thought Brad Pitt did an outstanding job as Achilles. It made me feel like he actually Was Achilles. He gave an outstanding performance. People think he is no good and became famous because he is good looking, no,he became famous despite that fact.Another outstanding performance was given by Sean Bean. I don't know why so few even mention him. I would give him an Oscar for the role. He stole the scenes he was in. I couldn't have imagined a better Oddiseyus. I am amazed!Of course we all know who the ""weakest links"" are : Orlando Bloom was just flat, he did nothing with his character and neither did the actress who played Helen.I watched this movie a number of times and the more I watch it the more I get the feeling that some actors are just reciting their lines.On the other hand, the more I watch the movie the more I am amazed by Pitt,Bean.Also I would like to point out the actress who played Brisseis- Rose Byrne. She did a very good job and she is very pretty.:)All I know is everyone sees what they are able to see. Some only see the outside glow of this movie, well,I could only feel sorry for those. I would say that this movie is not for people under a certain age and a certain mental ability.It is an amazing movie.",10.0,Anonymous,History
They did it better on XENA & HERCULES,"They did it better on XENA & HERCULESWolfgang Petersen should return to directing submarine movies. Troy is absolutely awful. His direction is undirected, the actors in Troy say the lines but without believable passion. The dialogue is lame and reminiscent of those sword and sorcery B movies of the fifties, but not as good. The film is plodding, dialogue is boring and the battle scenes were done better on Xena & Hercules not to mention those shows had witty writing spirited directing and good acting from then unknown actors. The casting is also uninspired. Diane Kruger who plays Helen is pretty in a blonde sort of valley white girl way and she didn't  have much to do in this film, the Greek  kings  all look like old bikers, and even Brad Pitt who I do like, looked ridicules. Troy just really stinks, a typical Hollywood piece of junk. Big budgets don't necessarily mean good movies, maybe great pay checks for the so called creative people involved, but that is all. !!!",1.0,Anonymous,History
my comments on Troy,"I was so disappointed to see Orlando bloom as Paris in Troy. He looked not only short, physically unattractive(kind of even turning ladies off), he was naive, immature and a coward. He looked like a 15 year old standing beside beautiful Helena which made me wonder what did she find so attractive about this guy! Really, what could she find so alluring about a Bloom look alike Paris !!! I guess that's why she couldn't do her part well either. It seemed that somehow she only wanted to get ride of her husband and finally she found a way out but I am sure that it must have been a different sensation in Iliad.About the scenes of the city and buildings, they looked so fake and above all it seemed that the whole story took place within two days!!! Brad was a bit disappointing too, he wasn't running around as much naked as I had red about it every where before the movie was released!Please any one who wants to make a historical movie, ask Mr.Peter Jackson to direct and cut back a little of that Hollywood glamor so that we can feel being in the middle of things. Thanks",,Anonymous,History
Argh,"OK, lemme first say that I wanted to like this movie. I REALLY wanted to enjoy this movie and hoped it would tell one of the greatest stories ever heard beautifully. Alas, it does not reach its lofty goal.OK, we start with the cast. Very well cast for the most part, except in one tiny little insignificant character who didn't mean much to the story named Achilles. Well, maybe not that insignificant. Brad Pitt is a good actor I guess, but not for a moment do I believe him to be this afflicted, tortured soul who also happens to be the greatest warrior of all time. Otherwise, the cast is dead on with great performances from Eric Bana and Sean Bean. Orlando Bloom pretty much just plays Orlando Bloom as Paris, the handsomest man in the world who gets his a**e kicked by a big fatty Greek.If there is one thing you can truly love in this film, it is the special effects. I listened to Roger Ebert's review who somehow thought that because there were so many Greeks and Trojans on-screen at one time that it pulls you out of the realism and reminds you this is just a movie. Wait, what? Ahem, my rebuttal: bulls**t. whatever else you want to say about this movie, it has CGI effects, from the amazing battle scenes to Troy itsef, which are rendered beautifully, though apparently a very large part of the city was actually built.But in the end, how does the movie really hold up where it counts; I found the dialogue to be, to use the technical term, summermovie-ish. There are a few great scenes, particularly when Priam, the father of the slain Hector, confronts his killer and begs to have his son's body returned. But when Brad Pitt remarks ""It's too early in the day for killing princes"" I almost laughed at the stupidity.despite its flaws, I still walked out of the movie with a smile on my face, though that might have been because one of my buddies ran into the soda dispenser on the way out. Troy is a good flick for people who want to see lots of men in small pants charge at each other screaming bloody murder, and then commence in the brutal slaying of one another. I enjoyed it despite its misgivings, and will recommend it for the summer lineup7/10",6.0,Anonymous,History
A gorgeously precise rendering of the most humanly flawed tale of all time.,"The Illiad being one of my favorite works of all time, I was dismayed when I originally heard about Troy.  There's no way, I thought, they could capture everything, there's no way 95% of the story will translate to screen.Thank god, then, that David Benioff was not trying to rewrite the Illiad for the screen.  His goal (and his accomplishment) was far more complex: turning the myth into a history, giving us the ""real"" story of the doomed city of Troy.Troy is an achievement, and while I think Wolfgang Peterson is wonderfully talented, I think what made this work was the team he made with Benioff, and the dedication of the actors.  Troy transports you.  I sat in the theatre in absolute awe of what had been accomplished, scenes I had been imagining since my childhood being played out in front of my eyes in spare yet rich detail.  There are no extraneous words or scenes in the screenplay, and the direction is deliberate and precise.The breakout star here, if he wasn't already on his way, is Eric Bana, as Prince Hector, Achilles' Trojan counterpart.  His Hector is at once confident and conflicted, pure and weak of heart, soulful, passionate and unrelentingly brutal.  Bana is stripped bare, he's thrown the whole of himself into this, and his huge presence is more than just his build. He's larger than life and humble at the same time.  He's managed to take a character written as the most pure, the most self-sacrificing with the most to lose, and made him unbearably human, as flawed as the rest of them, the rest of us, but overcoming it with a minute-to-minute internal struggle that's written all over Bana's open, mobile face.  It's worth seeing again for his performance alone, and for the chemistry that he sparks with every other actor.I will attempt to assuage some fears about Troy that I've been hearing since the moment rumors about the script and the casting started:1. No Gods:  This is a history.  This is not a retelling.  And in the oral tradition of the time of the original telling of the story, Benioff and Peterson have made this THEIR telling.  They made the decision to take out the gods, but they did not take out the spirit of the gods, they didn't take out the faith of the times or the people.  Yes, we all loved Clash of the Titans, but Troy is years better than men in togas presiding over claymation beasts.2. Brad Pitt:  A friend of mine said when the movie was announced, ""I have no ideas for casting except no Ben Affleck and no Brad Pitt.""  We were all, I think, a little shocked to hear about Brad's casting, because no matter how good he was in Seven and in 12 Monkeys, we all do just see him as his character in True Romance, right?  Rest assured, he's no Kevin Costner-in-Robin Hood.  Brad makes one of his finest turns as Achilles. Maybe not the best performance of the movie, but Brad committed himself to this role.  Spending hours researching and training , throwing himself into Achilles with a dedication I have to respect.  He does a fine job, and after the shock of actually seeing him for the first time, he blends into this new world that you suddenly find yourself believing in.3. Patroclus:  The love bond between Patroclus and Achilles, sadly, has been played down I assume because of the unfortunate general public reaction to an ""action hero"" being anything other than 100% straight.  I did feel like this detracted from the story, because while those of us who know their original relationship will be able to see it there (a deft bit of screenwriting and directing, as well as some excellent acting by Garret Hedlund), viewers who don't know this story inside and out will wonder at Achilles' motivations for his final choices, as ""cousin"" just doesn't have the same ring to it as ""brother"", ""partner"", or ""lover"" (depending on how, exactly you've chosen to read their relationship in Homer's tale.Orlando Bloom has a great turn as Paris, and has possibly the hardest role in the film: making an audience feel for who is possibly the least loved character in the history of literature.  His Paris is no longer the self-centered coward of the myth, but is what's inside all of us, the desperate struggle for life and happiness, torn between what he knows is right for his world and the simple life he wants.His performance and Benioff's crafting of his character is beautifully echoed in Saffron Burrows' portrayal of Andromache, Hector's wife and mother of his young son, who begs Hector to choose her, to choose life, over his love of his family and his country, his all-consuming honor.  Her honesty and her complete lack of guile is heartbreaking, and it makes her story with Hector one of the most tragic in a sea of tragedy.All in all, I found Troy to be more than I possibly could have hoped for, living up to my every expectation for a story I've been dreaming about since I was nine.  It's unpretentious and raw, precise and unrelenting.  It's a beautiful rendering of love, hate, honor and fellowship, and the choices we have to make as individuals when faced with options too big for one person. Homer would be proud.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Flawed Epic,"This almost $200 million dollar epic is loosely based on the 3000 year old classic the Iliad.  The question has to be asked of those who spent the money is what planet do they live on?  They had to be sitting around with the screenwriter and director talking about how to make the film.  One bright spark said, `You know, that Homer guy is a bit old fashioned.  His story is alright but after 3000 years it has gotten a bit stuffy.  We can do it better than some old Greek guy.'  Hmmmm.  Not good judgment.  If the story worked for 3000 years, why change it?Anyways, things meander about in earnest but plodding fashion until we finally get to Troy (Ilium).  Brian Cox chews up the scenery as a pretentious Agamemnon, the High King of the Greeks. Brad Pitt does well as the egotistical but fatalistic Achilles.  The real star is Eric Bana as the tragic Hector.For some reason, the 10 year war is condensed to a couple weeks, detracting from the epic Troy strives to be.  In that time, the classic confrontation between Achilles and Hector plays out.  This is the heart of the film and it works very well.  The satellite characters don't work well, and at times come off very awkwardly.  There are no Gods or Goddesses personified and so major characters who were heavily influenced by same are axed as well (eg. Diomedes).Overall, Troy is flawed by a misguided attempt to rework an epic story.  The central theme of the two heroes works very well, but even that is somewhat muddled by story changes.  The cinematography is first rate, it has a forgettable musical score (another flaw, all classic epic films has a memorable theme), but it also has pretty cool battle and fight scenes.  The violence and blood is not too graphic, but it is a bit too long for younger viewers and there is some brief gratuitous nudity.  Fans of the Illiad will be disappointed, but Troy is worth seeing for those who like epics in spite of its flaws.",7.0,Anonymous,History
*Best Movie I have seen in a long time****,"This movie has everything. From start to finish, you laugh(not that much) you cry, you smile, and you scream. The cast was well chosen. Brad Pitt was very good playing Achillies. But Orlando Bloom disappointed me with his selfish role. My favorite character would have to be Bersais. Mostly all the war scenes had some very gory images and I would not recommend this movie to anyone younger then 13 or 14 depending on there macheraty level. I have watched this movie 3 times since I have owned it and I still bawl my eyes out. The first I watch was 4 months ago. I was half asleep so I misted quite a bit. But a month later I watched it with a friend and we both loved it. A great movie to rent or buy. Filled with lots of emotion, and romance that makes this movie really great. The last time I watched this movie was 2 days ago and I cried more then ever. When you look at this movie, you think ' Oh it is just going to be one of those epic war movies with no story' But the movie is filled with a remarkable story. See this movie if you haven't already. And if you have and you didn't like it, watch again( maybe you missed something). And if you have seen it and love, watch it again just for fun, or invite a friend along.I list this movie as "" The best of its kind""",10.0,Anonymous,History
One of the best movies in recent memory,"Troy was an amazingly entertaining movie.The visual presentation, from camera direction to costume, was impeccable. The director and choreographers may have created the most visually impressive fight scenes with what they did with Achilles. The entire audience was awed almost the entire time Brad Pitt was fighting or leading soldiers. The iconic poses he hits during battle are going to be memorable to film. The epic battle scenes, the type that infects all of these movies, were thankfully kept to a minimum. Even though, the director was able to convey the sense that this was the biggest war ever waged to that point.All of the casting was perfect, and each cast member played their part as if they knew this. Each part was captured perfectly and acted as best they could be; I struggle to think of one role that could have been done better by another actor. I especially enjoyed how the writer made it clear that the romance between Helen and Paris was actually secondary to the real story: that of power hungry kings and glory hungry warlords, the men of wisdom caught between them, and the inevitable doom all men face.The retelling of the story was the best aspect of the film. The writer really amplified all of the tragic and ironic events of The Illiad, making you really care about the fate of Hector, Achilles, and Troy, and did so with perfect pacing. I was never bored, and I never thought a scene dragged on for too long. The retelling was also honestly believable and at the same time really sad: In the end none of it accounted for anything. Achilles' only gift was his curse, dying the moment he was finally liberated from his role as a warrior. Hector died for nothing, save the pride of a doomed nation. Paris lives for nothing. Troy falls for nothing.I am forced to give this movie 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Better than what I expected,"I finally went around to seeing this movie essentially because I was told it had an awesome rendition of the duel between Achilles and Hector, and I wanted to catch it on the big screen. Aside from that, I approached the movie with the expectation that the script was terrible, the acting equally flat, and the Iliad completely butchered. I guess with expectations that low, I must say, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the movie, unlike many of the IMDb critics who seemed to go in with very high expectations.The one criticism that I must agree with is that the love between Helen and Paris just didn't seem very convincing. Bloom and Kruger had no chemistry whatsoever. But as it turns out, the direction of this movie didn't seem to focus much on Helen and Paris but more on the juxtaposition between Achilles and Hector. Indeed, the script dismisses Helen as simply an excuse to wage a war that Agamemnon was itching to fight. Given that approach, I could forgive the lack of focus on their relationship.If you sift out all the battle scenes and cheesy lines (which you have to expect from a Hollywoodical epic and what most people pay to see anyway) this movie really comes down to comparing two heroes who have two different definitions of glory. In this regard, I thought the movie was excellent. While I think Bana was a terrible Bruce Banner, he was brilliant as the dutiful, honorable, and courageous Hector that Homer envisioned in his story. In the Iliad, Hector represents the ideal leader and is also a symbol of marital piety, both of which were well adapted in the script. On the other hand, while I think Pitt is generally a good actor, I think he was mis-directed. Pitt certainly did an excellent job of bringing out the arrogance and thirst for glory that represents the petulant Achilles, but did they have to cast him as a clean-shaven pretty boy the entire movie? It just seemed to take away from his credibility as an actor.Perhaps this movie shouldn't have been called Troy, but instead Achilles, since the movie is really more about him than about the siege of Troy. For example, they completely took out the Judgment of Paris and the character Cassandra. Instead, the movie begins and ends with Achilles; his flaws exacerbated by the virtues of Hector.While it certainly doesn't come close to any of the greats, overall it was a good film. Peter O'Toole was of course Peter O'Toole and Sean Bean did a fine job as well. I guess the key is to go in with low expectations and you may actually be quite entertained. By the way, the fight scene between Hector and Achilles really was great. Catch it on the big screen if you can!",7.0,Anonymous,History

"Bad epoch adaptation, extremely over-acted","I know its an epic movie and they usually have over-acting conceded, but add that to a bad epoch adaptation (screenplay, customers, make-up, manners, crafts, everything...) and the result is this gladiator-lordoftherings-wannabe that falls very short at the attempt.

But who knows, we've seen other overrated movies win a lot of Oscars before, like Titanic, where each statue represents like xzillion dollars invested which represent a lot of jobs....

A review of one of the worst movies of the year,"In all of literature, there is only a handful of works that can be considered to be truly great. One of these is Homer's epic poem, The Iliad. This Greek tragedy revolves around the Grecian hero Achilles and his role in the battle for the city of Troy:'It is the story of Achilles; or more precisely, it is, as has been frequently seen, the tragedy of Achilles, which develops through his quarrel with Agamemnon and withdrawal from battle, the sufferings of the Greeks in his absence, the death of Patroclus who tried to rescue the Greeks from the plight into which Achilles had put them, and the vengeance taken by Achilles on Hector, who killed Patroclus.' (Lattimore, R. 1961. The Iliad of Homer. The University of Chicago Press: Chicago)The Iliad begins during the tenth year of the siege and ends a few weeks later with the siege still under way.Oh the painSomeone forgot to mention this to producer and director Wolfgang Petersen and screenplay writer David Benioff. At least they had some sense in slapping a 'Based on Homer's The Iliad' before the end credits of this mind-numbingly long 165-minute film.In fact, the end credits are probably the best thing about this movie. I cannot understand this. Homer did all the work for them. They just had to transform it into a film.The trailers leading up to the release of Troy led us to believe that we would be getting an epic. Instead, all viewers will take with them after watching Troy is a false sense of The Iliad that is as twisted as it is blatantly wrong.In fact, given Hollywood's penchant for giving movies long titles, they should have called this Troy: How to rape a classic in three hours or less. Homer is probably on his way back from Hades to have a chat with Messieurs Petersen and Benioff.Money-making machineUnfortunately, this movie is going to rake in the money at box offices around the globe. Why is this? Well, there is a (potentially) brilliant cast on offer. Any movie featuring the likes of Peter O'Toole, Brad Pitt, Sean Bean, Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom has got something going for it. Alas, even a cast as strong as this has no hope of saving this wretched offering.For some reason - in all likelihood the screenplay - the acting is as wooden as the Trojan horse. The much-anticipated special effects come across as being bereft of any emotion. Even composer James Horner seems to have been sucked into the black hole that is Troy.This movie is a soulless example of just how badly Hollywood can waste the resources available to it. Warner Brothers would have gotten more value from the reported budget of $200 million if they had burnt it.Pitt (Achilles), Bana (Hector) and Bean (Odysseus) make an attempt at saving the movie, but do not quite manage it. While the glaring inaccuracies are too numerous to mention, the characters of Hector and Paris (Bloom) are the best examples of how making 'artistic' changes can succeed in irritating anyone who has ever read The Iliad. Even the one-dimensional Helen (Diane Kruger) cannot contribute anything to the movie other than provide it with a pretty face.Saving graceThankfully, there are two scenes in the movie which are worth watching. Of course, both revolve around two men trying to kill each other. The first instance is where Hector fights Patroclus (Garrett Hedlund) thinking that he is Achilles. The second being Achilles' fight with Hector. At least the choreographers did a good job.Other than cashing in on one of the most popular stories ever, I cannot even begin to understand what the reasons were for making this movie. I have seldom watched a film that has left such a bad taste in the mouth. Perhaps next time, Warner Brothers should get Peter Jackson to help them bring a literary classic to the big screen. God knows, Petersen cannot.",,Anonymous,History
I laughed a lot.,"Almost every time Brad Pitt opened his mouth in fact. He has been very good in some of his movies but he is so badly miscast here, that he unbalances the movie. His fight scenes aren't bad, but after listening to him struggle through the admittedly awful lines he has to say, I found the idea of him as a warrior just as funny as the rest of his performance. He even does a bad Marlon Brando impersonation shouting for HECTAAAAAAH at the gates of Troy. By this stage, I wanted anyone to smack him in the heel, I didn't much care who.Eric Bana works hard, looks great and is the most attractive character in the movie. At least, he has gravitas and some idea of what he is supposed to be doing. Rose Byrne is another who comes off well. Unlike the 2 actors who play the lovers. They are completely unbelievable, Helen has more chemistry with Hector than Paris. Peter O'Toole has one great scene, the rest is filler. Brian Cox shouts entertainingly. Poor Saffron Burrows is given nothing to do, neither is Sean Bean, who would make a great Odysseus in a different movie. The movie is packed with very good, professional actors but the script is so silly that the performers spend much of their time saying or doing unintentionally funny things.The battle scenes are OK (the night fight with the fireballs in particular is good to look at) and at least they don't involve much talking.A movie like this should drag you in, away from the real world and have you off in the Trojan War with them and it does nothing of the sort. Still, I found it so funny that I enjoyed it in a masochistic sort of way.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Best action movie so far this year,"Despite all the early criticism i have heard from this movie, I loved it.  I thought it had some of the greatest war and actions scenes in any movie.  I also thought all the actors did terrific jobs of their characters.  I complete disagree with people saying that Brad Pitt was miscast.  I thought he was great as Achilies, however I have to admit that my favorite actor/character had to be Hector played my Eric Bana. I do have to warn people that I don't think Wolfgang Petersen meant to try to make the movie exactly like Homer's the Iliad.  There a quite a few differences that i'm not going to get into.  Overall I definately recommend this movie to anyone who likes ancient war movies or any war movie for that matter.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"""I lived in the time of Achilles""","This film pretty much follows the story of Homer's Iliad with very few exceptions and a possible ending. However, the few exceptions and ending are what make this story work as a movie instead of a long poem. Stories being told many ways five different insights and there should be no conflict between the reader and viewer and both stories are real to the observer.For you, that forgot the story and you that know the story well but have not seen this movie we are looking at a story that you may or may not have had an opportunity to sidestep in school but can never have a grasp on social history without it. Some call it real and lost in antiquity. Others say that homer had a Good imagination. And others treat it as an allegory with a historical background.Brad Pitt who has played fickle people before is excellent in the part of Achilles and is sort of a heel. Nothing less was expected. It was the other actors that played their parts so well that you forgot you were watching the movie.The story:
Two Trojan princes are the guests of the Spartan ruler Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson). While Menelaus is preoccupied with other matters he leaves his wife, Helen of Sparta (Diane Kruger), to her devices. The younger Trojan prince Paris (Orlando Bloom) is left alone too many times with Helen and decides against everyone else's better judgment to make her Helen of Troy and thus pilfers her from Menelaus.As a husband, Menelaus is of course miffed. However, his brother the Greek king Agamemnon (Brian Cox) sees this as an opportunity to absorb Troy into his territory. Naturally this spawns a war in which Agamemnon recruits Achilles an extremely gifted and charmed warrior. Achilles goes to make a name for himself. He brings his cronies and his cousin. Together they do many bold and callous things.I will not go into the details of the war as you either know or will soon know the details. However, I will say that I thought that the Trojan horse was well and realistically designed. And you may want to pay attention to the background music as it is relevant to the film. The gods that fire the war are missing from this presentation.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Troy was one of the most devastating battles fought in history.,"Troy is an interesting movie because it focuses on the battle of Troy, rather than the emotional story behind it. One would most likely opt to represent the emotional story but then, one would opt for the epic motion picture as well.And so the makers of this movie have chosen to go down that path of making this a huge movie. And in concentrating the majority of the movie on the war, rather than the emotion has caused this movie to lag.I'm not saying this movie is bad. I recommend it to those people who are interested in Ancient Greek History... or seeing Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean in a skirt. It's great for entertainment, but the audience gets no satisfaction out of it and wonder what went wrong and why it feels like something was missing in the film.One thing that failed in this movie was the chemistry between Helen (Diane Kruger) and Paris (Orlando Bloom). The actors were unable to persuade the audience to sympathies with them because their relationship was not emphasised enough. I do not blame the actors for this. It wasn't their fault. There is only so much two actors can cram into not even 20 minutes of screen time together.Aside from Hector and Achilles, the story did not build up enough character for the audience to fully empathise with the other characters. Diane Kruger is beautiful, I'll give her that. And I felt sorry for Helen when she was crying to Hector because she felt it was her fault that this war started. But other than that, her character failed.And it is not entirely her fault. The movie was unforgiving to the rest of the characters because it chose to show the battles other than the emotion of the story. Diane Kruger did the best she could in the small amount of time she had to represent a portrayal of Helen of Argos/Sparta/TroyDid anyone else think that the beginning of this movie went awfully fast? It was almost like the direction of the film said ""Stuff the emotion, we want the battle!"".I agree with the fact that Troy is said to be one of the most devastating battles fought in the history of the world but is it worth sacrificing the emotional story for it?As for the story telling, it confuses audiences. Achilles (Brad Pitt) is not someone you would admire for being a hero. He is a legend and a hero to some extent. But he did not fight for anyone. He only fought for his own glory. The audience is following the story on the side of Achilles (or the rest of the mainland Greeks) Which the audience finds troubling. Because the audience usually sees the side of the story on a ""good vs evil"" side or a ""hero vs villain"" side. Achilles was not a villain but the audience feels he is when he kills Hector and drags his body back to the camp. And of course, the film makers try to get the audience to empathise with Achilles when he cries over Hector's body.On the other hand, before Hector dies, he is the hero. He's the noble one to the audience. He fights for Troy. He sacrifices himself for Troy. And the audience finds that admirable. He is the ""Good"" in this story. But us, as the audience, are seeing the story on the side of Achilles. It is slightly frustrating in this way because the audience wants to follow Hector who is the other protagonist in this story.I also want to mention the performance of Sean Bean (Odysseus) who is best known for his role as Boromir in the Lord of the Rings. If Sean Bean got more lines or more screen time, it would have been excellent. For someone who is so underrated as Sean Bean and for someone who got not nearly enough the screen time he deserved, he did a fantastic job.If the movie balanced the emotion with the battles, it would have been fantastic. It is still a good, watchable movie if you have nothing to do one Saturday arvo, highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Distractions ...,"I have to comment on the distractions I found in this movie.The main one being Brad Pitt.Ok, the dude is at battle, been so for days.  Knives, swords flying, shields pounding, blood, gore, and there is Brad clean shaven as all get out. Not even the beginnings of a five o clock shadow.Then his hair. Part of it neatly combed straight back and the remainder frumpled and wind blown. Distracting? At least for me, you better believe it.  Granted, at times he does get dirty and bloody, but through it all clean shaven at the very least.Oh, did I happen to mention that there is blood and gore in this movie?I gave it a 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A solid movie,"Not completely historically accurate and it took some liberties (Not that I care because I don't) but it was remarkable in many aspects. The cast was more than adequate and the realism was impressive. You feel like you are in the middle of the action and it never lets up. Watch it with surround sound and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. I have never been a Brad Pitt fan and probably never will be but I have thought that three of his performances have been noteworthy (Seven, Interview with A Vampire especially) and this is the third. This film needed a big big name to play Achilles, the greatest warrior who ever lived and they found one. You actually like his character and want him to win the battles and get the woman he loves and who loves him more than anything. This is the romance that the viewer really cares about not the silly and ultimately self-destructive one between Bloom and Kruger. The women were also very beautiful and added nicely to the viewing experience. I am also not a big fan of ""star-crossed lover stories"" but they did a wonderful job of weaving in the romance with all the action sequences. Bravo Peterson for not trying to give us another friggin Titanic which we didn't want or need. Eric Bana did a fabulous job as Hector he gave the film added credibility and Sean Bean as Ulysses was also a good if unexpected pick. Peter O'Toole as King Priam didn't hurt either and Brian Cox is back in the saddle riding high as the SOB Lord of Men King of Kings Agememnon with some clever dialog and witty banter with Pitt. Almost as good as Gladiator and Braveheart to be sure a great way to spend a Friday night. If the Gods are pleased they will follow up with The Odyssey as a sequel I would love to watch that as well and don't forget to cast Bean again.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Homer's got lucky, for he's dead","Dear Sir Peter Ustinov, where are you when we need you? And don't tell that you're dead, we don't accept this excuse.

Nobody saved this blown-up rip-off which left out all the wonderful Homerian ides which made the Iliad an extraordinary piece of literature over the milleniums.But maybe the fact that Homer is still dead led to what we had to watch for Homer for obvious reasons is not able to sue the filmmakers. He would have had enough reasons to go to court. Not only the storyline was destroyed, the changes in the main characters are unbearable.Dear Mr.Peterson and company: Achilles was designed as a brutal snobbish unreliable vanish arrogant bonehead on purpose, for example to create deep differences between him and the other Greek heroes like Odysseus, Agamemnon or Ajax. And so it would have been the definite better choice to cast the role with some kind of a young Sylvester Stallone. And by the way:Agamenon was killed according to the sagas back home by his wife and her lover.And, Mr.Petersen, have you ever thought why Homer wrote all the scenes about the gods fighting on one side or another? Could Homer have done this for dramatical reasons, maybe to create a real epic?And one last point,Mr.Petersen: The sun sinks in the west, and it does so for millions and millions of years, even in the age of the war for Troy.Thank you.",2.0,Anonymous,History
Finally a solid epic movie...,"This is the first epic movie I've seen in some time. Since the 50's the only one that pops on my head is The Gladiator, and it seems it started an avalanche. Now we are waiting for Hannibal and not one, but two Alexander The Great movies, and Troy has came. With such names as Brad Pitt, Peter O'Toole, Sean Bean, Brian Cox, and newly discovered Orlando Bloom and Eric Bana, it must be a spectacle. And it was. 160 minutes went with no sign of boring, the movie is very dynamic with battle scenes exchanging with the collecting of the dead and sad lamentations. The actors were very good in their roles, Pitt as an arrogant Achilles, a man who was born for glory, but who was fighting with his inner demons throughout the movie, and Bloom as a confused, scared and loving youngster, in the centre of the war that his love has started, and also Bana, as a calm and wise prince, who tries to defend his people. The story is known to us all, but i must it was very dramatic, and felt fresh and new, although two thousand years old. The things that bothered me: no sign of gods, which made the movie too realistic, I hoped to see at least Zeus and his lightning, but that's just me... :) And the Soundtrack should have been better. It's very monotone, with no catchy tune or theme, and doesn't fit with the scenes. After all I'd give it a 7.5, and hoping to see more grand epic movies... Maybe Sean Bean as a Odysess wouldn't be bad as sequel?",,Anonymous,History
Story line is a bit expected and simplistic,"I have read this story in high school and I after watching this movie I wasn't very impressed with the interpretation of the original story.1)I was hoping that a prologue with background history will be present to set a mood to the story.2)Lack (very much) of god in the movie, only Thetis mother of Achilles was present. It would be a cliche but if they kind of info-graphic (like in HellBoy) for the heroes and semi-god it would make it much more fun to watch.3)Patroclus wasn't his cousin. He killed a companion in an excess of anger, exiled himself in Thesallie where he Achilles lived.4)Apollo never showed up, it says Apollo helped Paris to hit Achilles in the ankle. Achilles suppose to be invincible everywhere except in the ankle. His weapons and armors are suppose to be made by gods.5)The list of things goes on and on...This is an ultra-conservative portrait of an outdated braveheart style (we have seeing too much mindless barbaric fighting, there is like only 2 scenes worth mentioning in this movie, Hector vs Achilles, and the first siege battle; we need technical battle scenes, for godsack) with the special effect of Mummy and cheap acting of Star Wars prequels. This movie really messes up my feeling about the ""maybe worth watching"" the up coming King Arthur movie.I would say that this movie is soulless, lack of technical fighting(army formation, strategic commands, logistics depiction), lack of human emotion (Greek mythology is like Shakespeare plays, it's full of tragedy, you don't get great emotions with a story, but with ppl acting on them. There is too much climax little to build the tension around it. It's too raw to be enjoy it, I got numb near the end of it. I never felt an urgency in this movie.), lack of grandiosity (I did not feel that Troy was a great city). Agamemnon wasn't evil enough...I will stop here:P If I wasn't a war movie fan I would rate this movie a 5.",7.0,Anonymous,History
surprisingly entertaining,"This movie suffers somewhat from negative publicity. Before it even hit the cinemas critics were writing it off. Never one to accept the critics views at face value, I went along to the cinema to check it out for myself. I have to say I found in thoroughly entertaining. It makes Homer's epic poem very accessible and fulfills the role of great escapist cinema very well. Brad Pitt is perfectly cast as Achilles and there are also memorable performances from Brendan Gleeson and Peter O Toole. Orlando Bloom and Eric Banna let the movie down slightly. I can just never take Orlando Bloom seriously. He'll never play anything other than romantic leads. The battle scenes are particularly powerful and some of the cinematography is quite breathtaking. Especially the thousand Greek ships sailing for Troy to bring back Helen. When it was released on DVD I bought it immediately.So don't be dissuaded by the critics, this movie is well worth renting at least.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"My, my, my...aren't we a bit prickly about this film?","And I thought that the people writing about Halle Berry's ""Catwoman"" were defensive.It seems to me that we have several camps of critics reviewing this film. Mr. Ebert represents this film as an insult to Homer and a bastardization of a legendary piece of literature. Others complain about the screen time that Brad Pitt has as Achilles. Let's just address these two issues for now.First, let's admit that Homer's work is based on legend and that most legends have at least SOME basis in fact. I think that Petersen does a pretty good job of filming a story that may have been the basis for the legends: The siege of Troy lasts several weeks, but is soon exaggerated to 10 years. Achilles is the greatest warrior, but is mortal like everyone else and dies in a manner that gives birth to legends about his parentage. The war itself is built on the pretext that Agamemnon is upholding Greek honor after Helen is stolen, while actually providing the excuse he needs to expand his kingdom. What's wrong with that? At least Petersen isn't depicting blue-painted Pict women fighting alongside the men.Second, Achilles IS a major character. He was a major character in Homer's poem and is a major character of Greek mythology. But I really don't think that he gets that much more screen time than do Hector and Paris. He's egotistical, a braggart, and a vicious fighter, all qualities I would expect in a famous warrior. Virtually all films ""based on events"" must focus on one or two individuals. Otherwise, you end up with ""The Longest Day,"" where all the characters enter and leave in just a few minutes.Now, I do have some criticisms. Whereas Petersen tries hard to stay realistic about in portraying the basis for the legend, I think he makes a mistake in depicting ""a thousand"" Greek ships. After all, just beaching the ships with minimum spacing between them would take over 4 miles of beach.I give this film *** out of *****.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Summer Blockbuster??,"Troy is good, but it lack of content. I thought I was gonna watch Troy as I watch the Lord of the Rings, but I was deeply disappointed. All I saw in that movie is Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom. This movie lack of 1.) content: the screenwriter choose to ignore the rest of the Troy history and related stories. 2.) Music, most of these kinds of films would have strong music to suit the movie, however, this one doesn't. So, what's this movie good about? The CG, of course. It's an undeniable fact. People behind this movie put a lot of time in the computer generating part, so we can see 1000 ships sailing on the sea and 50 thousand troops walking on the beach without having second doubt of its reality.Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie even though in my mind, it's a 6 points movie. However, this movie is the talk of summer 2004. I bet most people would forget about this movie before 2010 except Brad and Orlando's fans. Maybe I am asking too much. But, I think if they can spend the money on hiring Pitt, Bloom, and other superstars, they should come up with a better story line than this one.So...

Good (not great) but don't watch the TV version.,"I've watched Troy twice -- either the theatrical release or the director's cut when it first came out twenty years ago (too long ago to remember which) and the ""TV"" version just now -- and somehow they've managed to edit out every ounce of vitality from the censored version of this movie. It still has great action scenes and a great cast, yet the moment the killing stops they left nothing worth watching and I think that explains why there are so many negative reviews recently.That said, Troy (uncensored version) is just 7/10 good, not great, but it's worth watching provided you see it the way it was intended and not the butchered TV version.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Plot derailment?,"The film started in my opinion rather badly, since the lack of decent accents by the cast kinda got to me, Brad, Bana and Bloom are all very good except for the accents. they really hamper the film in its early stages.Once the invasion of troy begins things pick up. the Bloom single combat scene is where the film turns around for the better. the rest of epic in content and deliverance. the way that it shows the armies reliance on the main characters for leadership and victory is different than in most films i have scene and works vey well. The end is really let down as it seemed to me that they left out a few key scenes that would have rounded the film off nicely. the film takes to large a focus on Achilles and not on Helen and Paris. since they were (aside from the giant greed issue) the cause of the war, it would make sense to have some sort of reflection on how so many people died for the love of 2. but they dont. and it really let the film down.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Will Be One of the ten best movies of 2004,"Troy, the movie, has flaws, but it also many strengths. It is a much better than many of the critics give it credit for.Yes, Brad Pitt's Achilles is not perfect, but I can not think of any major actor who could do a better job portraying a man who thinks, moves, fights, and looks like he is an equal to the gods. Eric Bana's Hector was fantastic. Contrary to many of the reviews I did not find there were too many characters to allow any to be well developed. Yes, there were many characters, as the Iliad requires, but Achilles, Hector, and Paris were well developed and the story largely revolved around them.Among the minor characters, Sean Bean's Odysseus shined, as did Saffron Burrows' portrayal of Hector's wife. The costumes and sets did a wonderful job of bringing to life the late Bronze Age, a time more primitive and further removed from our collective consciousness than that of ancient Rome.The battle scenes were less gratuitous and were easier to follow than in many movies. Several of the one-on-one fight scenes, particularly that between Achilles and Hector, were exceptional.For me the movie's 2 hour and 40 minutes sped by. The script did have a few dumb lines, but also some good one. It is foolish to criticize the movie for taking substantial liberties with Homer's book. Any high budget movie of the Iliad that was faithful to Homer would have been financial suicide for its investors and much less satisfying to most viewers.My major complaints were that Diane Kruger, although clearly attractive, was not the rare one-in-a-hundred-thousand beauty (like the young Candice Bergen) that Helen should have been. I personally found Saffron Burrows much more attractive. I also thought that Brain Cox's Agamemnon was a little too much of a cartoon villain. But then many have complained the plot was too full of moral equivalence, so perhaps painting someone as a black hat was needed to make the story more emotionally accessible to the masses.In summary, I think it is likely that when 2004 ends, Troy will be at least one of my 10 favorite films of the years.",,Anonymous,History
"The only guarantee you have when you spend $200 mil, is that you spent $200 mil.","All in all, this movie was just barely average and here's why.  My first complaint is the color tones it was filmed in, this bugged me from the first few seconds of the film, it made it look old, like an old bible movie.  If they gave it more of a gold tint or a sharp clear image then the battle sequences would have been much more enjoyable to watch.  The next and biggest problem for me was the character development, and it's problem was, there wasn't any.  Things we just very rushed and weren't given the time to let you care for the characters.  They took a ten year epic and crunched it down into a three week dissapointment.  For example we have Helen and Paris, after three days or so of sleeping together they decide they are in love and decide to risk not only their lives, but the lives of everyone in Troy for it.  Then we have this huge army sailing over after them only a few days later, we are talking one thousand ships, suddenly packed up, including soldiers, set sailing for Troy.  And that scene wasn't near as grand as they made it look in trailors, it didn't have me excited at all.  And that was what really killed this movie, no excitement, you never got that, ""feeling"". And the fault in that lies in the hands of our director.  What I dont understand is why they give these huge budgets and trust these movies with people like Peterson and Zwick (last samurai), both of these films, with all the money they had and such great actors could have done so much better. When making these movies you need the likes of Speiberg and Zemeckis involved.  Actually, for handling this movie, I think Peter Jackson would have been perfect.  In the end I think the movie came out too soon and I give it 2/5 stars.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Initially Skeptical, But Now Predicting This Movie Wins Best Picture 2005.","I hesitantly went to see this movie because I couldn't find anything else worth seeing right now, and my husband likes action/adventure movies. Having watched most of ""Helen of Troy"" last October on USA network, I must admit that I feared seeing a regurgitation of a storyline I'd already seen and couldn't believe the playtime of nearly three hours, but I went anyway.If I had to sum up my review for this movie in a single word, it would be `Wow!' I predict that both Brad Pitt and Eric Bana will be nominated for Oscars next year for this movie, and it will win the Oscar for Best Costumes and Best Picture. I also believe that history will write this epic movie on the scale of ""Gone With The Wind,"" ""Cleopatra,"" ""The Ten Commandments"" and ""Titanic."" The only thing that will hurt the `classic' status of this movie is the R rating; though in hindsight, I can't help but think they were aiming for a PG-13 and just missed.After watching some of the promo interviews, I was kind of nauseated by Brad Pitt's disgust over the fact that the interviewer wanted to talk more about his physique rather than his role in the movie. The phrase `don't hate me because I'm beautiful' just kept popping up in my mind. But after seeing the film, I must say that I believe that this film will be the defining performance of his career. The only performer that `wowed' me more was Eric Bana who played Hector, and I have to give an honorable mention for Peter O'Toole as well. The stunts, the costumes, the settings, the screenplay, the cinematography, the casting (with one exception noted below), and the performances were nearly flawless.One other group that may be disappointed in this film is the one going to see blood fly and body parts severed. This movie makes Gladiator look pale in comparison, with the exception that the focus is on a well-planned plot and not on showing as much bleeding and carnage as possible. It does have many grand fight scenes and blood *is* shed, but the focus is on plot-necessity, not gratuitous gore. I count this a plus, but I know some will not appreciate this omission. I followed one viewer out of the film whose immediate response was, `That movie was so boring, but I'm sure it will win a lot of awards.' My guess is that she would fall in this aforementioned group of viewers.I am having a hard time coming up with criticism for this film, though I did find a couple of points. The movie is merely `inspired' by the original poem, `The Iliad.' While I think the `rewrites' are clever and add to the plot of the movie, I'm sure that history buffs will be annoyed by the introduction of `facts, not in evidence.' Also, whomever hired the *very* brightly blue-eyed son of Hector ought to be taken out and shot. Both Hector and his wife have *very* brown eyes, and this baby is much too large to be passed off as a newborn. The kid's cute, but the least they could have done was change the eye color in post-production. If I were Hector, I'd be wondering, `Who's the daddy?' because it definitely couldn't have been him. There's even a greater than 80% chance that the mom isn't his either, if you follow the genetic probabilities.Historically, I've not been a huge Brad Pitt fan, but I must say that this film is now in my Top-10 list of all time. And, believe it or not, I left wishing they had *added* five minutes to the movie to solidify the fate of one of the main characters but understand that the focus of the movie wouldn't allow for this clarification.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"A nice blockbuster suffering from an awful adaption of the ""Iliad""","Ok, I looked forward to this movie for months. No I must say that I´m a little disappointed. The movie itself was a solid blockbuster, nicely made and with a supreme cast. But if you know the ""Iliad"" you know how to make the story even better. (Originally) 10 (!) years of Trojan war decreased to a few weeks. That automatically has the effect of harsh story-jumps and is creating lenghts while explaining all the new problems emerging. Additionally, the ""Iliad"" is a divine story and the Greek gods take part in that war themselves: Achilleus is not killed by paris, but by a goddess who takes position for Troy and is raged about the desecration of Hector´s corpse. The priest Laokoon tries to warn not to pull the horse into the city and is killed by Poseidon´s sea snakes. I think these would have been nice story kicks which should have been brought in. But although if one decides to avoid divine influences the film does simply not reach the original tale. Good that there were also positive surprises like an amazing Hector (Bana) who totally convinced as honourable prince of Troy fighting for ""patria"" and family.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Very interesting film,"It has been years since I've read Homer's epic, so some details have slipped my mind. The filmmakers do make some changes, but none that struck me as so awful it diverted my attention.This film is 2 hours and 45 minutes long. Therefore, if you're going expecting to see one long bloody battle, reconsider. Much time is spent on the human relationships and the characters- thus making the audience care before someone is killed in battle.THis film is for those who have read, actually understood and appreciated Homer.

Troy — Beautiful Greeks in incredible battle and fights,"Troy is an action movie trying to extract all the influence of the gods from the Illiad in an attempt to rationalize the story as an historical event.The action is grandiose, the story interesting, the scenario has a good pace, and the special effects are still acceptable by today's standard.Brad Pitt, as Achilles, is at his sexiest and his most arrogant. Is rendition is probably close to what a invincible demigod would be like. Eric Bana is probably at his best in the role of a good hearted Hector. Brian Cox, as the power hungry Agamemnon, makes us hate his character like only he can do. Diane Kruger seems to struggle in her role lacking some fluidity. Orlando Bloom, as lacking talent as he does, probably did his best performance as the romantic, clueless, charming and cowardly Paris. Sean Bean is perfect as the valiant and cunning Odysseus. And finally, Saffron Burrows moves us with her lovingly tragic rendition of Andromache, Hector's wife.Now, for a few bad things. The fighting, either man to man or on large scale, is not realistic, and neither are the armors, although they mostly respect the style of the time. Also, the rowing wouldn't be functional as depicted. However, most of that is just nitpicking, and the really annoying bit is that the dialogs, while not being dull, are weak for the most part.If you want plenty of action in the time of the Greeks with beautiful people as actors, this should satisfy your needs.

Nothing too special,"Troy was great visually though I've been getting used to these large battles sans guns since LOTR so I've been a little dulled to them. The city of Troy, though very not-historical, was beautiful and portrayed much as we think Ancient Greek places must look. All the boats were very nicely done, though it doesn't look like they are being rowed very hard sometimes. Costumes were very nicely done too, though its hard to tell which side is which mid battle.I know in the beginning it says ""based on The Iliad"" but I really think it could have been a better representation of the great Greek Epic. It could have used some sweet Gods fighting amongst themselves and aiding the people to clear up parts of the story. They really had WAY more to do with the war than is remotely acknowledged in the film. It would have been difficult to do, but if it was done well-enough, it would have separated this film from others of the style. Paris's love in the beginning also could have been explained 100% better with the whole Hera/Aphrodite story.Speaking of the little coward, Orlando Bloom's voice is getting just plain annoying. Hes getting type-casted as the little weenie ladies man who is willing to sacrifice the British navy or some great ancient people just so he can get the hot girl. I'm getting a little tired of it. If he wants to prove himself to be a decent actor, and not some teen phenom, then he needs to show that he can do other types of parts. I knew he was Paris, so he killed Achilles (also not the way in the Iliad and also involving gods) but I was rooting for someone to smite the puny wuss. I kept wanting him and his little lame pick-up lines and quips about his true love to get off the screen in favor of Brad Pitt being cool.Other complaints: Some of the battle clips are really lame. You see like one or two people hitting others in a very fake/unrealistic way. One of the scenes in Agamemnon's ship is simply horrible. Its supposed to be comic relief I think except for the fact that its not funny at all. The Trojan King (forgot the name) is overdone in a few scenes. Achilles's cousin is almost as annoying as Paris.The good: Agamemnon's thirst for power was very well done. Fireballs rolling down the dunes were sweet. Hector and Achilles fight scene was spectacular. Great great choreography and well acted on both sides.It was definitely a preview to the big-budget summer movies to come.Overall - 6/10 - might have been a 5 if there weren't some good hecklers behind me",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Wow, that was one underrated movie","I usually trust most critics when it comes to epic movies since it's not one of those genres like comedy that would be described by most of them as ""low intelligence art"". Brad Pitt was truly excellent, all actors were truly excellent. Got some points of Homer's Illiad quite well, of course it couldn't include everything and hey, they were honest to say it was 'inspired' by Homer's ""Illiad"" not even based which would be OK. And anyway I'm from Greece and here we are taught Homer from Junior high school but not in any way does a comparison with the original poem makes the movie any worse or any better. The only way actually to make a book or a poem like that into a movie is to make it a series of many, many hours.Thumbs up, that was a 9/10 movie no doubt about it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A stellar cast in a pretty good flick,"It could have been shorter. It could have had a bit more character development. It could have had a stronger plot to string together the battles. However, I really liked it. Maybe it was the subject matter, maybe it was the cast, maybe it was the look of it and the cool battles, but I liked it. It's really the one-on-one battles that are more enjoyable and impressive than the large army clashes. It was interesting that they chose to show both sides equally, with neither being necessarily the ""bad guys."" More interesting is the fact that I don't think Helen was all that. Rose Byrne, as Hector's cousin (and Achilles' woman) Briseis, was far prettier. As usual, I won't go into great plot detail or anything, as every other review out there can tell you that.

What a waste!,"One of the most poetic and beautiful sagas ever written and they have ""inspired"" it to death! The siege apparently didn't even last long enough for Brad Pitt's hair to get dirty. Pitt was uninspiring as a hero. Although he was quite effective as a pouting little brat. His great fighting skill consisted mostly of a jumping sucker punch with a sword. The film was apparently a vehicle to showcase his buffed body and lack of acting talent. Peter O'Toole was decent and I am pleased this is not his swan song, it would be a travesty. Orlando Bloom, while he looked the part of pretty Paris, certainly could have used some acting lessons because he was boring as a wooden horse, strike that, the wooden horse was slightly more interesting. It was a complete waste of time, money, and effort to watch it and an unspeakable waste to make it in the first place. All involved should be ashamed.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Review from a teenage drama queen,"So, to be totally honest one of the main reasons I went to this movie was because of the cast. Brad, Orlando and Eric, what more could you want? But I actually really enjoyed it. I was a little bit wary because I had read several bad reviews, but I didn't think there was anything wrong with it, I thought it was highly enjoyable.It was a bit squemish at places with a bit of blood and gore, but the best thing about the entire movie was how cleverly they mixed in the romance with the battles. There was 3 romance stories going on, firstly between Paris and Helen of course, then between Hector and his wife, and Archillis and his romantic partner who I won't say cause it gives it away.But OMG Brad Pitt! What a wonderful character he played! So masculine, and dangerous and at the same time so adorably sweet! It's interesting I walked in an Orlando fan and walked out a Brad fan. He was fantastic.Being a Lord of the Rings fan, its funny how much LOTR and Troy are the same. There's similar lines at places for eg ""I would have stayed with you my brother."" And of course with Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean staring in the movie. WonderfulSo yeah, go see this movie. It deserves the recognition its recieved, and will certainly be one of this years big blockbusters.",,Anonymous,History
Thank God Wolfgang Petersen turned down Gladiator,"First things, first. The fact that this movie is not an epic like it should be is entirely Wolfgang Petersen's fault. We are all grateful to him for passing on the opportunity to direct Gladiator - the honor of which was finally bestowed on Ridley Scott. The movie falls short in many respects. First of all, the romance between Paris and Helen is not fleshed out enough to justify the war. Second, most of the actors like Brad Pitt as Achilles, Orlando Bloom as Paris and Diane Kruger as Helen are miscast. Although a good actor, Brad Pitt cannot bring life to the average script like a non-American Thespian like Russell Crowe would. He has the body, the looks and the moves of Achilles but he lacks the passion in his voice. Diane Kruger plays Helen but she also lacks the strength and presence necessary for the role. The script is lacking in many ways too. There are no memorable moments or dialogs that stick with you after you watch the movie as with Gladiator. The music is passable too. There are no musical themes for Troy, the Greeks or the heroes that add to the movie experience and that develop the characters or make the scene. On the positive side, Peter O'Toole and Eric Bana are both outstanding as are some other British actors.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Looks like we've got to go to 1250 BC to avoid Christianity,"I admire Wolfgang's convincing vision and Brad Pitt's interpretation of the spirit of the warrior. All in all a great time at the movies.Brad's wonderfully aggressive as Achilles and you can see why his opponents would fear him and his men would want to fight along side him. I don't think the departures from Homer noted in other comments are important as there's every reason to believe the myth could have arisen from events as depicted here. And all the women were captivating. I especially liked Helen and Hector's wife. Peter O'Toole almost stole the show though his part is relatively brief. But, really, EVERYONE does a great job. There's a very good grasp of courage here that's missing in most of the movies set in similar time periods.Wolfgang Petersen's far more insightful about the reality of that time, and of that kind of warfare, than his predecessors, with the possible exception of Gladiator. I found the computer generated armies only slightly disturbing. The important thing was the vision.And, by the way, though brought up a Catholic: What a relief not to have to endure a lot of Biblical bunk!",9.0,Anonymous,History
Troy and Pitt -- a fortunate combination,"Short and sweet -- I have not been a Brad Pitt fan before, and I still find it painful to listen to him speak extemporaneously. It is the usual wearisome, monosyllabic new-speak one has become accustomed to with his entire generation.So, perhaps it was simply a genius of casting that brought him into the role of Achilles in this movie, but however it was done, it was inspired. Whatever ability this actor has to convey and project the power of the Achilles personality was used here, forcefully, believably, and in the most visceral way I can imagine -- convincingly, but with subtlety.In the Pitt interpretation, Achilles is a lion -- almost superhuman. He's one of an uber-menschen class who rise innately at the opportunity to be part of an event that will make their names resound throughout eternity. But do not mistake this for some overly-directed, ""Charlton Hestonesque"", one-dimensional performance. Far from it.Pitt is keen and as fresh as the ocean spray he speeds through to be certain that he and his men are the first to burst upon the the shores of Troy, to capture the glory in taking the Temple of Apollo, long before bloated, jaded King Agamemnon and his 50,000 plunderers can get there.See Pitt's confusion and revulsion when King Priam appears in his tent. The sheer inability and unwillingness to countenance that singular human moment, finally submerged in respect for the old king and the son whom he killed. That alone was the equal of anything Brando ever did, and that is very, very good.Yes, Brad may well look back on this as being the movie that had him most-favorably cast, for there are few stories of any real interest that could focus on a persona like his. This one is it. It's all about Achilles. And it's quite well done, making you wonder if Brad Pitt doesn't have tremendous potential after all, even after you doubted it for years.Well, yes, Diane Kruger will render you speechless with her indescribable beauty. In another coup of casting, she is indeed a face that could ""launch a thousand ships"". Her beauty recalls that of Sophia Loren forty years ago, and that is magnificent.I didn't speak of Orlando Bloom as Paris. If you know Homer's story you know the rest. Believe it or not, there was a time when this was required reading in high school. It's somehow poetic justice to see ""Legolas"" with the Paris mission, so, I will say no more. Actually, they say Orlando has gotten quite good with a bow and arrow. ""Why doesn't that surprise me?""I didn't even want to rent this move, but did so because my wife wanted to see it. Bummer, but one does what one perceives keeps the peace. Now I'll very likely buy the movie. All in all, it's that good, although they did leave out one of the most compelling characters in the whole saga -- that of Cassandra, the prophetess.Pitt was so very good, though, they probably could have dressed him up in drag and had him play that part, too. If you like Pitt, or just wondered what it would be like to see him, just once, in something that didn't suck like an industrial-strength vacuum cleaner, then see ""Troy"". His magnificence in the role of Achilles cannot be denied. I am trying to think if I've seen one better....",8.0,Anonymous,History
"It's yours, take it.","Trojan prince Paris is not only having an affair with Spartan Menelaus' woman, Helen. He also lures her away to live with him in Troy. Thus giving the global domination obsessed King Agamenon the launch pad to war with Troy. Which in turn brings into conflict Spartan hero Achilles and Hector of Troy, two of the greatest warriors that ever lived.Troy, budgeted at $175 million, and given to director Wolfgang Petersen with orders to craft a swordplay epic based on Homer's Illiad, is not the truly great picture it really should have been. It is, however, a spectacle of sorts, that by way of the extended directors cut, becomes a fine enough addition to the genre it so clearly wanted to crown.The problems are evident from the off. The casting of Brad Pitt as Achilles always looked to have been based purely on looks. Nicely toned body and brooding close ups do not a warrior make, and thus, as good an actor as Pitt definitely is, this is a role (and genre) too far. Diane Kruger as Helen is under written, which since at the time was a poor actress yet to bloom turns out to be a bonus here, and Orlando Bloom playing the wimp like Lothario Paris the way he should do - still gets out acted and swamped by all around him. The other main problem is how uneven the story telling is. Petersen looks confused as how to condense the Trojan war in the running time, whilst also juggling the emphasis of the two great warriors at its core. That Eric Bana's excellent portrayal of Hector comes through the jumble is a testament to Bana's ability and nothing else.The good is, well, rather good though. Agamemnon, courtesy of a nasty turn from Brian Cox, is well formed. It gives the picture a reason for being outside of it being a war about some bloke stealing a woman from another bloke. Imperial cravings and a genuine thirst for blood helps lift Troy out of the rocky waters it had found itself in. Peter O'Toole, Brendan Gleeson and Sean Bean do fine work with what little they have got, and the production values on offer are hugely impressive. The fight sequences impact and are full of gusto. The fight off between Hector and Achilles is superbly choreographed (fought out to a score that James Horner has lifted from the one Danny Elfman used for Planet Of The Apes three years earlier) and the battle between the armies outside the walls of troy sits with the best in the genre. CGI is often called the bane of cinema, but when used so well as it is here (see the ships approaching Troy for instance) it proves to be an effective and entertaining tool.Troy has problems, of that there is no doubt. But come the end one knows that it has been entertained, one knows that this was a time of heroes. So with that, and the knowledge that the film made a profit of just over £320 million worldwide, Petersen can smugly sit in his chair musing it was job done. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,History

Not bad but I suggest watching Gladiator!,"In the year of the epic this one stood out for me as the most excitable. The other big one left is King Arthur and as a fan of Excalibur I thought that they would have a tough time beating that. Also we have not as yet seen a large scale version of the Trojan wars. It is a story that screams out for a big screen adaptation. Impenetrable fortresses, super warriors and giant wooden horses it doesn't get much better.As far as your standard epics this is somewhere in the middle. Not great but certainly not that bad either. In terms of spectacle it is fantastic. The film looks superb and has some truly massive battles. In many ways though it offers nothing we haven't seen even more impressively in LOTR. I now the basic details of Homer's story so in terms of peoples complaints that it doesn't stay true enough to the text I couldn't really comment on, but it does have what I wanted to see, the giant wooden horse.The cast are good. You have a big array of talent all on top form. Firstly though the negative side. Brad Pitt. Now just to point out, I'm not an anti-Brad person. I'm in the minority who thinks he doesn't get enough appreciation for his acting. In Troy however he seems to Brad Pitt, too much like he is putting on an accent and acting. It's not natural and it seems very much like the makers are milking the fact that this is Brad Pitt, much like Cruise was milked in the Last Samurai. As an action man he manages to convince however. He's in great shape in this movie. In fact he has put on a lot of muscle and kept his trademark six pack, the ladies will be happy. Eric Bana is superb as Hector. He also makes a good action man and he is basically Troy's super warrior whereas Achilles (Pitt) is the Greeks super warrior, albeit one who hates his king and can't be controlled. Orlando Bloom is okay but for the guy who causes all this trouble over a bit of skirt he certainly seems to disappear from the film for lengthy spells. Brian Cox is as usual superb in a villainous role as Agamemnon. Is he really supposed to be that evil though, I remember Agamemnon was in Time Bandits played by Sean Connery and he was a stand up bloke. Brendan Gleeson is also good as is Peter O'Toole. Not forgetting Mr Sean Bean as well who is good as ever, if underused. As for Diane Kruger as the trouble making wench Helen. She is really required to do little else than be pretty (and did they have make-up in those days? because she doesn't half wear a lot of slap.).The films action and effects are as you would expect from a reportedly 200million dollar epic, first rate. The action really crunches, particularly with one-on-one encounters. The fight between Achilles' and Hector is excellent stuff. The battle scenes are impressive but as I said before they aren't as good as LOTR because of the ingenious way Jackson can use effects, he is a master.The story has problems for me. Not the screenplay as such, but the original text. They had a lot of stories from all those thousands of years ago that can seem at times pretty stupid. They didn't really mind plot holes back then. Yes people will say this is an epic love story, but those people will be females who love Orlando Bloom and want to mother his children. This fool Paris steals away the king of Spartas wife and then starts a war that will probably mean the destruction and death of his kingdom, all for a woman. No offence to Diane Kruger but there is not woman alive who looks good enough for that! I might for Jennifer Connelly though. The real hum-dinger is the fact that the Greeks supposedly seem to have left the shores of Troy having left a giant wooden horse, just large enough to house 500 Greek soldiers with adequate room for toilet facilities and a pool table. Then they decide to bring it into their impenetrable fortress. I reckon that Homer couldn't think of a realistic way that the walls of Troy could be breached so he decided that the Greeks should be let in, then he thought 'I'll have them hide inside a giant horse'. To be honest they did kind of deserve to get slaughtered, and Blooms head should have been put on a spike to show the world what a Muppet looks like. Yes I'm getting sarcastic now but this is a problem, you cannot side with the Trojans. Effectively Greece are the oppressors and the bad guys and the audience should be siding with the Trojans but they aint half stupid. The human side of the story and the characterisation doesn't allow you to get close to a character. You can't help but dislike Paris for being a fool and having a girly name. You can't help but think that Achilles is being acted out by someone. Peter O'Toole as the King of Troy I didn't like either, he should have given Paris a damn good thrashing when he came waltzing in with Helen Of Sparta, and sent them both back. He kept listening to crap advice ahead of sensible advice too. As far as rooting for characters the only one who is given a good human dimension who we can root for is Hector and Bana is very good in his role.As for the sound and the music in this film. Well the sound is excellent. When people get sliced into two you can really here the cracking of bone cartilage. Every penetration of sword buzzes and vibrates from the rafters to your chair and into your spine. Really great sound design in this and as with most films of this scale it is pretty much got it's name down as an Oscar nomination for the sound. The score however will not. It is a big let down. Apparently they had an original score done then they dumped it and hired a new composer to do it coming up with something that is so standard epic and 'lets rip off Gladiator' that it becomes intrusive at times and at other times doesn't affect you enough.Overall though this is a good popcorn muncher. It doesn't have any great depth that an epic really must have to become a classic, and certainly I preferred Last Samurai this year in the battle for number one epic. Thus far it has been a bit disappointing as none have come close to Gladiator. LOTR is kind of an epic but it is more fantasy as well. I suppose I'll count them as epics but that means that King Arthur and also Alexander will have an even higher, probably unobtainable standard to beat. Thus far Troy comes third in the year of the epic behind Passion Of Christ and behind current leader The Last Samurai.***",6.0,Anonymous,History
Mythical melodrama almost at it's best,"No one did this story better than Homer. We'll leave it at that. However, the movie was great for what it was, a movie. Sure it's based on the great classic and the 1000+ year old story, but no one ever said it was accurate. I do think that had the writers been closer to the original story (as told by Homer), we would have seen a much better movie but, Hollywood being what it is, great is never great enough.It's all here: romance, deceit, love, hate, revenge, death, tortured lover etc. I went in not expecting much but great costumes, beautiful people, amazing action sequences and mediocre acting. What I walked out with was a little more. O'Toole was amazing. He does deserve an Oscar for his portrayal of Priam. Sean Bean was also a notable supporting character. I never cease to be amazed by his roles. Though I've never seen him in a starring role he is never forgettable but rather a force to be reckoned with. Bana surprised me with his talents (especially after the sad, sad mess that was Hulk) but most of all, I was impressed by Brad Pitt. Though I've always believed him to have some talent, I was a bit concerned with how well he would pull off Achilles, the greatest warrior that ever lived. I wasn't prepared for his excellent portrayal of the doomed warrior.I did leave happy. I got more for my money than I had expected and this will definitely be a movie I will consider adding to my limited collection. If for nothing else, this is a good, entertaining movie.

Hector vs. Fabio.,"The good news is, *Troy*  isn't as bad as the trailers would lead you to believe.  It is certainly better than Ridley Scott's  *Gladiator* . . . but this is not saying a great deal, as the latter was terrible.  Director Wolfgang Petersen deserves praise, first and foremost, for knowing how to film a fight scene.  The one-on-one fights, between first Paris/Menelaus, then Achilles/Hector, are thrilling and realistic, but more importantly, FILMED SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.  Petersen eschews the lazy new mode of fight scenes, which is to quick-edit them out of all comprehension.  His camera floats around the battles, giving us a nonpartisan and omniscient view.  Much the same can be said for the larger battle sequences as well, even though the overuse of computer-generated armies deducts credibility.  (We're told that Agamemnon's army is 50,000 strong, but what we see are millions upon millions of computer-generated cartoon-men.)A few ideas even manage to sneak into  *Troy*, along with the fabled wooden horse.  I liked the contrast between the older, far more civilized, Trojan culture, with its reliance on omens and religion, and the more grounded, realistic, Machiavellian political culture of the invading Greeks.  Petersen even gives Brian Cox's Agamemnon a decent speech about how proud he is of turning a ragtag assemblage of superstitious barbarians and  ""snake-eaters"" into a modern, imperialist nation.  Understanding the difference between the two cultures is crucial for engendering an interest in how things turn out.But therein lies the problem, because anybody who attended high school already knows how things turn out, and therefore a $200 million epic that puts its trust in plot to the general exclusion of other interests is bound to be ultimately forgettable.  It's not the STORY that's important  (and I don't even care about the screenwriters'  wild liberties with the Troy legend, as it's legend anyhow and not history), it's the SETTING, and the IDEAS, that count.  However, this movie simply cannot afford to immerse us in the pre-historical world of Agamemnon and Priam:  there's too much money at stake.  And so they'll have a big weekend, make their money back, maybe win a technical Oscar next April, but no one will remember the actual film. Big accomplishment!  Why bother?And there are other problems.  Let's start, first of all, with the score, which has got to be one of the worst I've ever heard in a major motion picture.  Written by James Horner, it consists of a woman moaning atonally for minutes at a time.  ""Ahh-yah-ahhh Yaaa hhaaa"".  It keeps cropping up whenever there's a battle about to take place or whenever some hero lies bloody in the sand.  It makes you want to tear your hair out and poke knitting needles in your ears.  Second, let's consider Brad Pitt.  God bless him, but the fellow has a speech impediment, and that never really works when you're playing one of the globe's most legendary heroes.  It's an unkind thing to say, but there it is.  Further, he looks like a cross between an aging California surfer and Fabio:  his physical presence carries zero credibility.  (How many BLONDE Greeks do you know?)  Third, Achilles is given a love interest in the form of a young Trojan priestess Briseis:  this is a mistake, because the actress playing her is prettier than the actress playing Helen.  A story about the Troy legend should always to defer to Helen as the sublime example of feminine beauty.  But then, I guess the writers couldn't figure out a way to get Achilles romantically involved with Helen, so they had to trump up something.  This flatters the movie's Big Star, but it hurts the movie.Pitt's miscasting is countered by an otherwise excellent cast  (Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom as Hector and Paris are particularly strong), but there's not enough good stuff here to warrant a recommendation.  4 stars out of 10.",3.0,Anonymous,History

It looked like butter being stabbed by a warm KNIFE!!!All in all, a great movie that was even better than Gladiator mixed with a little Braveheart.Ten out of Ten.",,Anonymous,History
"A Tale of Men, not Gods","Wolfgang Petersen's epic ""Troy"" is great spectacle and classic tragedy that enrolls us, due primarily to the performance of the classic movie star, Brad Pitt, in the role of Achilles. Much has been acknowledged regarding David Benioff's screenplay based on Homer's ""The Iliad"" that the Greek gods' presence has been omitted in this retelling of the fall of Troy. Also the great warrior Achilles (played by Pitt) is mortal-- more or less. This is left ambiguous with the appearance of his mother, Thetis (a brief Julie Christie), who foretells Achilles' fate. In Greek mythology, Thetis was a god who married Achilles' father, Peleus. Petersen's choice for ""Troy"" may be the right one. I did not read Homer's classic poem. Though having Achilles as a great warrior, aware of his mortality, seeking only to serve a noble king makes Achilles' courage and honor poignant. Also given the current state of affairs both ""Troy"" and ""The Iliad"" remind us of the paradox of war. Early on in ""Troy"" Achilles says, ""In war young men die, and old men talk..."" Homer's poem told a story of the fall of Troy and the cost of war. Like Homer, Petersen is also telling a story, and he does it well.The Prince of Troy, Paris (Orlando Bloom), flees with Helen, Queen of Sparta (Diane Kruger), away from her husband, Menelaus (Bredan Gleeson). Paris's brother Hector (the charismatic Eric Bana) must protect Paris as they return to Troy. Menelaus is the brother of Agamemnon (Brian Cox), who is king of Greece. As Paris and Hector return to their father, King Priam (a wonderful Peter O'Toole), Menelaus joins forces with Agamemnon, and Odysseus (a very good Sean Bean) to invade Troy to reclaim Menelaus's honor. For Agamemnon this is merely an excuse to add Troy to his empire. However, Troy is a formidable kingdom, so Agamemnon's adviser convinces him to enroll the rogue Achilles in his quest-- a man he respects though despises. Achilles also holds no regard for the king. However, the shiny object for Achilles is that this war will serve as his legacy. Surprisingly, it turns out that this is not really vanity on his part.In an interesting choice, Achilles is introduced as a ""rock star"". He has to be awaken from a drunken orgy, surrounded by gorgeous naked women, to be reminded that a deadly opponent awaits him on the battlefield. He expediently dispatches his hulking adversary, and challenges the other soldiers crying ""Is there no one else?"" Brad Pitt is an awesome and charismatic presence. For ""Troy"" he got in amazing physical condition-- his body looks phenomenal. He fights expertly with the sword and spear-- the training really shows. His fight scenes are precise, elegant, and brutal. The battle between his Achilles and Eric Bana's Hector is awe inspiring. Pitt is a gifted actor. Along with a fierce intensity, and seeming arrogance to the role, Pitt balances the performance with a sense of fatalism, and an understated compassion. He tells his captive priestess, Briseis (an effective Rose Byrne), that the ""gods wish they were us"", because life is invaluable. And there is an moving scene out of ""The Iliad"" where Priam (O'Toole) asks Achilles for the body of his son, Hector. Pitt's commanding performance really personalizes and serves this major epic.Aside from Eric Bana and Peter O'Toole's outstanding supporting performances, some of the other critical characters' renderings are distinctly uneven. Orlando Bloom plays Paris as love sick, stupid, and void of courage-- probably the way the character was written. Diane Kruger is stunningly beautiful, but as Helen of Troy, ""the face that launched a thousand ships"" something is missing. These two missings are noticeable, because they are critical plot points. Bana as Hector is noble, heroic, and humane-- a great rival and foil to Achilles. O'Toole as Priam brings a touching wisdom and world weariness to the role. He is a great actor.Petersen's ""Troy"" is visually stunning. The attention to both detail and the immense scale are a remarkable accomplishment. Though as great as the large battles are, it is the individual battles or conflicts that are most compelling. It is the personal quest of the hero Achilles that matters most. For that, one has to acknowledge the talents of Brad Pitt.""Troy"" is solid storytelling from a great director, Wolfgang Petersen, and has a moving and compelling performance from Brad Pitt.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"It does Homer justice, I think","This is an epic film based on an epic poem, and it is well told. There is much that is missed out and much that they've used license on but it works well and in terms of Hollywood is brilliant. Brad Pitt is superlative; beautiful, his physical presence on screen is domineering and like a ballet-dancer in the fight scenes. This is one of his best roles, and I imagine one of the most challenging; especially with all the leather mini-skirts he has to wear! It's not brilliantly acted, by all the characters, a little hammy, but in terms of CGI/SFX, production, direction and general cinematography it is superb. I would have liked to see 'grey-eyed Athena' in the film but the gods and that aspect of the story were missed out completely (except as reference, of course). As spectacle the film rivals the old Hollywood epics such as Quo Vadis and Spartacus for scale and also modern greats like LOTR.There's lots to get your teeth into in this film; action, romance, history, good storyline and tragedy and you don't have to be a ancient Greek historian to follow/enjoy the film although you are likely to know the end given that everyone knows the story of Achilles (don't they?) The Set Design and Costume were great; just the right amount of modernity but suitable historical reference. However, it is Hollywood and you can't get away from that, but it's the kind of Hollywood like Anthony and Cleopatra, with wide angles of whole ancient cities, and a massive cast of extras which is just great to watch. I loved the score - the ancient style of chanting and singing. There's some awesome ""bullet time"" (Matrix) slow-mo action in the fighting which will take your breath away - and some of the action is graphic and bloody but it's not so bad that it's offensive and as it's all in keeping with the era and genre and apposite to the story.The film makes me want to read the book again. It's not a perfect film and will never be a great classic, and the dialogue is a little confused, but visually it looks good and is an enjoyable watch if not taken too seriously.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Couldn't they have found someone to play Helen who COULD have launched a thousand ships instead of 3 or 4 canoes?And where the HELL were the gods!!! Talk about missing the whole point! The gods CAN'T be extricated from the story. It would be like The Ten Commandments with no God, just the burning bush.What a waste of 3 hours of my life.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Great Great Great Movie!,Powerful is one way to sum this movie up! I had learned all about the Trojan war before I saw the movie and it was the best version I have heard so far. The setting of the film was incredible! Brad Pitt was hotter than he has ever been which is pretty hard to imagine. It was the best acting he has ever done. He completely convinced me that he was the real Achilles. Eric Bana was so amazing. He was so full of passion I just was in awe. Orlando bloom was the perfect Paris. This movie was beyond perfection. I was so happy that it was not too bloody. They could of made it so gory and I'm so glad that they didn't. The love story between characters was incredible. This is one of my all time favorites! I recommend that everyone see it!,,Anonymous,History
"I am very mad at every underestimating review here, that was one hell of a movie!","7/10 IMDb ? really ?! this movie lacked nothing! now i haven't read the book or the Iliad or whatever that is you're talking about, but to underrate and give such horrible reviews about such a fantastic piece, i am sorry, what the hell were you folks watching? the movie had all the successful elements, and it came out a great solid amazingly-structured masterpiece, and please tell me why there has to be the bad guys and the good ones in war ? The people of troy were of course the people of honor, but Achillis and for sure many other Greeks, were undeniable, as Achillis was the man of glory.

I loved this movie,"Troy was one of my favorite movies! It was very enjoyable to watch. The scenery was beautiful and the acting great. I was mad that Hector died because he was a good man and would have mad a great king. Do u think Paris would have mad a good king? Achilles was a great leader and i loved how they per trade him. I wonder what would have happened if the Trojans hadn't let the Trojan horse in. I think that the Trojans would have won the war if they hadn't. I wonder if Bresis would have gone with Achilles if he lived through the war. Troy is one of the few movies that you get attached too. It lets you forget about your life and sink into the stories of others. It has it all, war, love, revenge, hatred, and comedy.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Needless Destroys The Story,"I just saw Troy... and damn it, I'm confused. I want to love it; as much as I want to hate it. The more I think about it, the more I can't because it's hard to distinguish between the movie and Homer's epic it's based on. David Benioff (the screenwriter) is smart enough to put ""inspired by"" instead of ""based on"" since, clearly this is not the Iliad I love.Things The Script Got Wrong:1. Achilles never fought for Agamemnon before the war.2. Hector never went to Troy.3. It ignored the Gods and The Golden Apple.4. The Achaeans and Trojans never wanted Peace.5. The war takes place over ten years, not days.6. Menelaus does not die.7. Achilles dies BEFORE the horse.8. Upon his homecoming, Agamemnon's wife Clytemnestra, and her lover Aegisthus kill him to seek revenge for sacrificing his daughter to Artemis and to gain control of his kingdom.9. Contrary to popular belief, the Trojan horse isn't even a notion in The Iliad (and is barely mentioned in the Odyssey. The Aenied actually gives the most in-depth story of the sack of Troy).10. Paris dies.11. The girl, Chryseis, Achilles falls in love and takes captive is daughter of Chryses, priest of the god Apollo. The daughter is not a priestess nor related to Priam. They mix up this story with the other tale: he fell in love with King Priam's Polyxena (Ploydora in the movie). In this tell, he wishes to marry her and goes to see Paris, who murdered him when they met; furthermore after the sack of Troy Polyxena is slaughtered on the grave of Achilles.11. The screenplay opts to leave out the meeting between Odysseus and Priam to end the war peacefully.12. Hector's baby cries because he sees his daddy with the shield on, not because Hector leaves!13. Sinon is left behind by the Greeks (buried in the sand up to his head) to trick the Trojans into accepting the Horse. It's not Paris who warns of the horse, but the Trojan priest Laocoön and his two sons, whom tells Priam, ""Timeo danaos et dona ferentis"" (""I fear Greek, even bearing gifts"").14. The Trojan Horse was a gift to ATHENA!!!!15. Apollo sided with the Greeks because Chryses prays for his assistance.16. The Greeks never sack Apollo's temple.17. Achilles meets with his mother after Agamemnon steals Chryseis away, not before he goes.18. Hector's wife survives, but his child is thrown over the wall.19. Helen goes back with Menelaus.20. Paris does not give Aeneas the sword of the city; moreover they escape because Aphrodite (Venus in the Aenied) assists him.21. Pyrrhus also called Neoptolemus, murders Priam and Priam's sons in front of Aeneas' eyes. Agamemnon does not kill Priam.Things They Script Got Right:1. The hatred between Achilles and Agamemnon.2. The honor of Hector and his love for country and child.3. The love between Achilles and Patroclus.4. The death of: Ajax, Patroclus, Hector, (and somewhat right Achilles).5. The scene between Achilles and Priam went Achilles agrees to give Hector back and have a twelve-day armistice.But... the real question still looms? Is it any good?Yes and no. The worse comparison one could make is ""It's not a good a Gladiator"". Well, Gladiator is a completely different movie. It's more personal and intimate, a rich character driven story with battle scenes sent in Ancient Rome. Troy is an epic, based on the Iliad, the ""first and last real novel"". So, for those expecting to see another Gladiator, you will be disappointed; and you have been misinformed.It certainly is a beautiful film to watch: the sets, costumes, extras, battle scenes, cinematography, and directing is rich in the Old Hollywood epic. The final battle scene between Hector and Achilles is superb.The acting is spectacular for what's there. Brad Pitt has received mixed to bad reviews for the leading role, however he didn't disappoint me. True, there where times he was doing some ""pouty-appear to be deep thinking-eyebrow"" acting, which I groaned at (because that is not the Pitt who won me over in Fight Club or suitable for the character). But, in the end, he comes through.Additionally, as much as I want to hate Orlando Bloom, he was good as Paris. He played him right, as the weak and feeble boy surrounded by men. Brain Cox is deliciously evil (even though he overacts at points) as Agamemnon. Peter O'Toole is simply brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. But Eric Bana might possibly be the best of the bunch, playing Hector as the honorable hero, who loves his son and fatherland.What Troy comes down to is the script. David Benioff fills it with long-winded superlatives and self-righteousness that doesn't always work. At times there's no momentum and the picture feels like it just stops. But, when it works, it works perfectly and entertains.If you know nothing about the Iliad, go and enjoy. If you can read it in Ancient Greek, you are warned.***/*****",6.0,Anonymous,History
Great War Epic in a long time,"I've seen many many movies and Troy really stands out, it is on a higher level than most other war epics. The fact that Brad Pitt will not win any awards for the movie just because he isn't a ""Russell Crowe"" (Gladiator) is ludacris. He acted brilliantly as Achilles-I couldn't have picked a better Cast. Eric Bana was outstanding as well, Orlando Bloom, I know all the ladies love him, but I don't enjoy his acting style as much...The balance between talking and battle scenes is something I notice a lot in these lengthy films. Many either have too much fighting or too much talking but TROY was so evenly balanced, I'm disappointed the DVD wont be released until January 4th, thats almost 1 year but it hopefully will be worth it! Its a double disc set. Hey check out the new Alexander movie with Colin Farrell...its a good flick!",10.0,Anonymous,History

"If you liked Gladiator, see Troy.","What we have here is a big budget, over the top Hollywood movie. Decent script, with lines delivered with Shakespearian emotion. It was fun. Simple as that. It's like Gladiator 2. A movie you can really get lost in. There are a couple of pacing problem, fast-slow-fast-slow, but overall a worthy night out. Brad Pitt's movements are as impressive as his acting, and Eric Bana has more than redeemed himself for his role in the awful Hulk movie. He is fantastic in this film! A true tragic hero. The CGI was not up to Lord of the Rings standards, but was still excellent. Sweeping battle scenes, and hacking and slashing a plenty!

Expected more.,"Review of ""Troy"" (2004)""Troy"" delivers visually stunning battle scenes and impressive choreography, making it a spectacle for fans of large-scale ancient warfare. The film's grand set pieces, like the duel between Hector and Achilles, are intense and well-executed. However, beyond the thrilling action, the movie lacks the deeper sense of tragedy and complexity that makes Homer's ""Iliad"" such a timeless epic.The character development is shallow, and much of the emotional depth and moral ambiguity of the original story feels lost. Achilles, portrayed by Brad Pitt, comes off as more of an action hero than a conflicted, complex figure grappling with fate and immortality. Similarly, Hector and other key characters are reduced to mere archetypes, missing the nuances that could have elevated the story.The film also glosses over the philosophical and thematic elements of the original epic, like the interplay between fate, honor, and the gods' influence on human lives. While ""Troy"" is visually impressive, it fails to capture the heart and soul of its source material. In the end, ""Troy"" is more about spectacle than substance, leaving those looking for a deeper narrative somewhat disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,History
You know what they say about empty vessels?,"I can't entirely hate this film because Julie Christie was in it.This film really does deserve the criticism directed at it. Brad Pitt is as wooden as the horse itself. My friend and I were discussing how much difference it would have made if they had swapped him for the David Beckham gladiator in the British Pepsi adverts, they performed roughly the same. The supporting cast are not so bad, well maybe they are but they are not on screen for so long but almost all of the major characters are woefully two-dimensional. This allowed for no atmosphere and a forced sense of drama that you had to prod yourself into staying focused to and thus plodding along to a conclusion. What several people said on here about unbelievable characters is certainly true. It would appear that a few mis-castings took place. Certainly Brad Pitt was, he simply is too 'Hollywood' to carry off an epic role. On the other hand, Eric Bana is competent and Orlando Bloom carries Paris off well enough (even if Helen and Paris have no on screen chemistry) but both contributed to an overall underwhelming feeling. You know this when the first 35 minutes have felt like 2 hours.The battle scenes are impressive as are all of the sets and infrastructure of the film but again this is nothing that hasn't been done in a bigger and better fashion by LOTR already. The film picks up into the final hour when the horse arrives and the final battle inside of Troy kept me focused and redeemed the previous 90 minutes to some extent.Then the ending went and blew it all... I have laughed at how people have stated that the film is 'loosely' based on The Iliad. They want to try and have respect for the magnitude and endurance of the tale before being so dismissive. The ending is appalling.Suprisingly, the eight o'clock showing of this was only about 25% full. It's not the worst film I've ever seen, far from it and I'm not necessarily right but it was a missed opportunity. Size is not everything and from the hype of the past few weeks, empty vessels clearly do make the loudest noise. 3/10.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Johnny Hobeika,"When i went to the movies to watch TROY , i didn't know what the movie was about ..... i heard of the legendary ""Trojan Horse"" , but never before of the whole war ... in other words , i went just because i'm a Brad Pitt fan ... but after i watched the movie , i was simply overtaken by it ... its unbelievably nice !!!! Few Months later , i bought the DVD , and ever since , i've been watching it over & over again !!! It's simply OUTSTANDING !!! I was so overtaken with the whole epic legend that i wanted to know more about ""Homer's"" masterpiece , and whether or not it really existed .... I began by reading the Illiad , and yes as most of the previous writers i did find a huge gap between Wolfgang's version of the Illiad , and the original story ..... And yes , as previously stated , Greek gods actually play the major role in defining men's destiny .... but i preferred Wolfgang's version .... Look at it this way .... there's too much details about gods to be prevailed in the movie , and if the makers of the movie were to include all these details , than the movie would seem something like ""The Matrix"" ....in other words , Wolfgang's version of the story is based on reality .... take for instance the death of Achilles . It is originally written that the only way to end the hero's life was through his tendon ,knowing that the hero was dipped in the holy water of the river Styx .... However , Wolfgang previewed his death as the ordinary death of any man , only Achilles pulled out the arrows except that of his foot , which ultimately led people to believe that the only way to kill him was through his tendon .Eventually , for me , the whole movie is simply PERFECT !!!! If it weren't , i wouldn't have watched it everyday for the last 6 months , and told others to do so .... The whole tragedy made actually consider of leaving MY mark in the world ... i now aim at immortality just like Achilles . My goal is to actually achieve something in life so that i would live on peoples tongues ,books , and tales for generations and generations to come .....",,Anonymous,History

But, the storyline wasn't explained well enough. I mean, sure I could tell exactly what was going on, but there is so much more that would have made the movie more impactful. If the writer had found a way to explain the legend from Greek mythology instead of making it a historical movie, I think people would take more away from this movie. Either way, it was still such a great movie. Brad Pitt was perfect for the role and Orlando Bloom was a great wimpy prince :) Overall, good job!",7.0,Anonymous,History
A Spectacular Take on the Iliad,"Wolfgang Petersen's take on the Iliad is a really special film from start to finish. He gets excellent performances out of his stellar cast. Many critique it stating that it differs from Homers work, however, I would argue it's about as good as you can capture in a time condensed format of a film as opposed to a mini series. I would also argue that this might be one of Brad Pitt's best performances of his career. Eric Bana is also excellent as Hector of Troy.Watching the film gives the feel that you are transported back to the times of the Greeks. The dialogue helps explain the thinking in weighing logical reasoning versus their beliefs in the impacts of their gods to determine their fates. It engages the viewer by often giving them advanced information to show how poor and flawed the decision making is made by certain members. This has you screaming in your head ""how can you possibly make this decision"". This sort of frustrating but entertaining feeling was very present throughout the film. It is perhaps one of the reasons I get the itch to rewatch the film every couple years.Also, all the battle scenes are all well done. The stakes always feel high. Even after having watched the film many times over Achilles anger with Hector and screaming his name endlessly and still knowing what's about to come gives me chills.An all time favourite movie for me. Must watch for anyone interested in any historical battles. Will be interesting to see what Nolan does with the Odyssey.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Great actors but too long,No doubt a monumental work from master Wolfgang Petersen. Simply story about soldiers and the sense of war.

I would compare it to the phantom menace,"This movie has things going for it for sure. Having Brad Pitt in your movie helps. The fights are very entertaining and most of the second half of the movie is solid. The plot is fine.

Homers ill my lad,"First of all who decided that every scene with ""epic"" qualities in this movie should feature a whining singer going oooh ooooh all the time, and why were'nt they shot. This spoiled every single great moment in this movie, and led me to cover my ears frequently. Brad Pitt is great expertly conveying Achilles boredom with the endless battles he is forced to fight, because there is nothing else he can do.  His first fight should surely go down as one of the great fights of the year second only to his fight with Hector. Peter O'Toole is a cert for an oscar nomination, especially considering most people assumed he was dead. Oh and for all those reviewers the Thousand Ships Helen launched, those were the ones the Greeks sent over to get her back. The only major flaw in this movie is the fact that Agammemnon only becomes a villain in the last half hour leading at points to the viewer not knowing who to root for in the battles.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Epic scale but thin characters,"An epic scale film for one of the oldest stories ever told. Helen, a senior figure in Greece, leaves to join the Tojan royalty sparking a vengeful war initiated by the warmongering King Agamemnon who is aided by the rogue but legendary warrior Achillies. The film looks great, the settings and costumes are incredible and the line up of acting talent is awesome. Unfortunately the characters are extremely thin and single-dimensional and the dialogue is unsophisticated, with characters needlessly and frequently spelling out their emotions and motivations. I also find the big scale battles to be dull to watch. Obviously this came out during peak Lord of the Rings fame and scenes of unfathomably large armies running at each other were all the rage. However I found the one on one fights much more compelling and the Achillies and Hector showdown was genuinely tense.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Watch the full director's cut.,"Just watched Troy (2004) Director's cut. I had only ever seen the theatrical release version before. It's criminal that Wolfgang Petersen's full version had to be stripped down by 33 minutes. The director's cut tells a fully story in all its bloody gory and does not feel rushed in any way. This is the only version I will watch going forward.This movie remains amongst the best in the genre. It tells a tale of love, war, honour, pride, duty, and respect with infinite glory. 20 years later, Wolfgang's depiction of Homer's The Iliad remains a timeless classic. My recommendation is to watch the full director's cut.",10.0,Anonymous,History
By Zeus what a disappointment!,"When will Hollywood learn that if its not broke don't fix it! So many times great books and stories have been defiled and defaced beyond recognition by film makers thinking their improving on the original. The Famous story of Troy and the Iliad has lived on for nearly 3000 years, yet in their infinite wisdom Hollywood decided to 'improve' it. I was left bitterly disappointed but the final product, it has no soul and the changes to the events leave a bitter taste. A strong cast cant make up for the lack heart and tension, whilst Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom are woeful as Achilles and Paris. It's the character of Achilles who takes centre stage yet Pitt has none of the gravitas of Russell Crowe's Maximus, instead he just furrows his brow a lot like he's taking a dump. There's no room for the interfering God's and memorable character's such a Diomedes, they have all been cut out for a typically turgid Hollywood romance between Achilles and slave girl Briseis, BORING!!! Despite quite an exciting showdown between Achilles and Hector the other fight scenes are totally uninspired, if only Ridley Scott and directed this! Hats off to Sean Bean who makes an excellent Odysseus, sadly he is not given nearly enough screen time that he deserves - one can only hope an Odysessy film is made with him in the lead role. The film's music is terrible and grates after a while. A musical score can raise a film this one does the opposite, why Gabriel Yared's original score was scrapped is a mystery. The finale is just damn right sacrilegious! Talk about a Disney ending!Obviously screen writer David Benioff had no real consideration for the legend of Troy because all the key events have been changed so there can be an upbeat ending. The less said about the song accompanying the credits the better, Rambo: First Blood anyone? All in all a movie that had the potentially to be a classic but ended up a rather average affair. Hopefully in the near future someone else will attempt at bringing this amazing story to the screen and do it justice.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Achilles and Patroclus,"OK I've read a number of the comments written about this movie - many tearing it down because of inaccuracies (not just inaccuracies but GLARING ones) - and in general I agree. While film makers need to have some license with the material in order to squeeze a 1000 page plus book into two hours, I agree with one of the other opinions that they changed SO much the writers would have been better off doing their own story in that time period. Peter Jackson did an infinitely better job with the Lord of the Rings because he gave the larger-than-life story the screen time it deserved.Let me just add a couple of observations that I haven't seen listed in any of the other comments as of yet. I've heard a bit of Greek music in my day and the music in the background during the battle scenes (a lady singing ""ah-ee-ay"" etc.) does NOT sound Greek - sounded much more like an Indian chant. But my biggest beef with TROY is this: The reason that Achilles was SO bummed about the death of Patroclus and treated Hector the way he did was not because he felt guilty for sending his ""cousin"" into war but because they were LOVERS! The two men were inseparable and ""closer than brothers"" as referred to in both the Iliad and Odyssey. Granted, I didn't expect to see Brad Pitt in any make out scenes with another guy - the producers in Hollywood (and America audiences in general) are still a bit too homophobic for that. There are ways they could have hinted at the relationship however and made the connection between the two men much stronger without ever resorting to a physical moment. Instead, they portrayed Patroclus as a young pup that hung on Achilles every word while leaving no question in anyone's mind that Achilles was a straight, womanizer (albeit reformed at the end). Look at our first glimpse of Brad in the movie- he's sandwiched between two wenches!! Is it so hard for people to believe that the best fighter in the Trojan war was capable of an intimate relationship with another man? The admitted gay heroes in myth and history are so few and far between  does Hollywood really think it necessary to make this famous couple straight too?",,Anonymous,History
A Movie for homophobes,"I would go on to review this movie, but... should I even have to? You know Achilles ""cousin"" in this movie, right? Patroclus? In actual Greek Mythology, Patroclus was Achilles' lover. Yes, his boyfriend. They where together. And they changed that to cousins in this movie. Why? BECAUSE THIS IS A MOVIE MADE FOR AND BY HOMOPHOBES!!!Seriously, this is the most offensive thing I have ever heard of! Even Hitler would be like ""come on - this is just low""! I know he has done some horrible things, but... it bites me so much this is how it works in media - especially in Hollywood. This is after 2000, people. Shouldn't we have grown more mature by now, you think?? I mean, come on... so Achilles and Patroclus where a couple in Greek Mythology. What is the big deal? Do you seriously do this to appeal more to the mainstream audience? Because in that case; it still IS very, very low. I mean, come on... COUSINS?!

Underrated film,"""Troy,"" as we all know, is an adaptation of Homer's classic poem, ""The Iliad."" It tells the tale of Paris, the prince of the Kingdom of Troy, who falls in love with Helen, the wife of King Menelaus of Sparta, and kidnaps her. This outrages Menelaus, and he begs his brother, Agamemnon, for help. Agamemnon sees this as an opportunity to make war on Troy, and he gathers all the kingdoms of Greece in a war against Troy. Warriors from every Greek kingdom is present at the war; among these warriors is Achilles, one of the most famous figures in Greek mythology. And thus begins the tale of the Trojan War.The story of the Trojan war is, perhaps, one of the most popular myths is human history. It has had several film adaptations, including the 1950's ""Helen of Troy,"" a 2003 film of the same name, and, of course, 2004's ""Troy,"" released after the success of epic films like ""Gladiator"" and ""LOTR.""David Benioff, using ""The Ilaid"" as a primary guide, writes the screen play and retells many of the most famous events in the myth. Of course, every adaptation of a literary work has some changes to the original tale, and ""Troy"" is no exception. It is filled with many changes to the ""Iliad"" in the name of artistic licensing. Example of changes include:-The Death of Menelaus under Paris even though he's supposed to survive the war and reclaim Helen as his wife again-The death of Agamemnon under Brisies even though his wife is supposed to kill him when he comes home from the war-The fact that Achilles is on board the Trojan Horse even though he's supposed to die even before it was built-Paris living in the end even though he's supposed to die during the war-And, perhaps the biggest change in the original story are the omission of the Greek gods, who play a major role in the story.But despite these changes to the original tale, ""Troy"" is a fair adaptation of the Greek myth. The omission of the gods is tolerable and makes the story realistic; ""Troy"" is an attempt to tale the tale from a realistic point of view, excluding many of the supernatural elements. There is no mention of Achilles' immortality (unless he's struck in the heel) and it takes several arrows to kill him. But this does not mean that ""Troy"" is an unfaithful adaptation, since it has the basics. The war, like in the original tale, in this film, is triggered by the abduction of Helen by Paris, and this film also has the famous Trojan Horse.With an acceptable script to work with, ""Troy"" fell under the direction of Wolfgang Petersen, famous for his work in ""Das Boots.""This movie includes an all-star cast, a cast headed by Brat Pitt as Achilles. Gaining muscle for his role, Pitt portrays Achilles as a strong warrior. But even though he is the star of the film, the real star is Eric Bana as Hector, the Trojan prince and hero of his people who comes face-to-face with the mighty Achilles. Bana portrays a noble warrior like Hector and makes him a person you'd want to root for. The best performance in this movie goes to Peter O'Tool as King Priam of Troy, a loving father and wise ruler. Other stars include Brian Cox as a believably vile Agamemnon, Brian Gleeson as Menelaus (angry that his wife left him for the pretty boy prince of Troy), and, of course, Orlando Bloom and Diane Kruger as puny Paris and beautiful Helen, the two lovers who started the Trojan War.Now, for the technical parts of the film, one word - impressive. The sets are realistic, and so are the costumes. The cinematography is breathtaking (this film was filmed in Mexico and Malta). And, of course, no film is complete with a score. Originally, Gabriel Yared's music was supposed to be on this film, but it was deemed too ""classical"" a replaced with James Horner's music that he made in less than two weeks, a score that is considered inferior to Yared's, but I still found it tolerable. This movie also includes Josh Groban's ""Remember"" in the ending credits.When ""Troy"" premiered, it receive mixed reviews from critics and the public. The criticism was based on its changes to the ""Iliad,"" while others blasted others like Orlando Bloom's portraying of Paris as a weakling (even though he's supposed to be) and several others. However, despite criticism, this movie still manages to get a 7.0 rating on the IMDb and has some decent reviews.Overall, ""Troy"" is a fair adaptation of the Iliad and a good epic film.163 minutes Rated R for graphic violence and some sexuality/nudity",8.0,Anonymous,History
A tale for our times?,"There are several problems with the film 'Troy', if one is trying to fit it too closely with the literature which inspired it, Homer's Illiad. There are too many deviations from the ancient Greek epic poem for this to be other than 'inspired by' - there are characters missing; there are characters whose fates are different from the Illiad (no spoilers, so you'll have to trust me), and the overall situation is cast in a very different light.In the film, Achilles (Brad Pitt, looking more bulky than usual) is the greatest warrior alive, with a reputation unparalleled in the world. However, he is a loose cannon, as likely to kill his own leaders as the enemy. Achilles is tempted to the battle with Troy, portrayed as one of the greatest battles in history, by the call of everlasting glory. Achilles is persuaded by no less an ironic character than his own mother, who recounts to him the prophecy of an idyllic life at home should he stay, but then to be forgotten after he dies, or the chance at immortality in legend, despite the fact that he'll die at Troy. Achilles sets sail.The war with Troy is portrayed as having been going on for a decade; at a peace meeting in Sparta, Paris (younger prince of Troy, Orlando Bloom) falls in love with the fair 'was this the face that launched a thousand ships' Helen, wife Sparta's king, Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson). Helen steals away with Paris on the ship returning to Troy; Hector, the elder prince and heir to the throne (Eric Bana) is conflicted as to what to do, but opts to journey on to Troy, and the die is cast.Agamemnon (Brian Cox) uses the event to band all the Greek city-states together into a final battle with Troy, the greatest rival to his power in the Aegean (and the centre of much of the civilization of the world at that time). This is where the retelling becomes much more modern. The Illiad is not so concerned with economics and hegemonies as with ethics and honour - Agamemnon is portrayed as a Realpolitick power-seeker of the first order, willing to stop at nothing to decimate allies and foes alike for his own power, willing to use honourable pretenses to achieve dishonourable ends. An astonishing armada is amassed and sets sail for the coasts of Troy. Once there, the beachhead is taken, and the first major act is a desecration of the temple of Apollo by Achilles, who nonetheless proves himself the most valuable warrior the Greeks have. At this point, the internal strife becomes as problematic for the Greeks as the front lines, as Achilles disregards the commands of Agamemnon and cares little for the political outcomes of the war.The intrigues and the plotting of the Greek leaders are cast in high relief against the more pastoral leadership of 'good king' Priam (portrayed by Peter O'Toole with his characteristic panache). Hector is a strong and wise leader under his father; Paris is the foolish and rather cowardly one. (We are missing the back-story of the Illiad of how Paris came to be part of Troy's royal family, and it is assumed that there is no unusual story there.) We rather lose sight of the fact that, indeed, Paris stole the queen of Sparta (again, the modern idea creeps in - in our day, a woman would have the right to choose where she wished to live, but not so in the ancient world; one might question whether the queen of a nation has the right to abandon her role and 'shack-up' with the neighbouring prince at will, but I digress...).The people of Troy are seen as virtuous despite the fact that they are defending the less-defensible position morally. The Greeks might have right on their side in some respects, but this is lost in their brutality and by the unbridled greed of their leaders, and of course it is the ordinary foot-soldiers, including Achilles, who have to do the fighting and dying for the cause, as their princes exchange gifts of gold, money and priceless art treasures to congratulate themselves on their victories.The film portrays the battle lasting only a matter of a few weeks; the brutality of the battle scenes is as dramatic as any in modern war films, just as bloody. The single-combat scenes between Achilles and Hector, Hector and Patroclus, and others are extremely well choreographed, introducing various techniques I've not seen before in sword-play films.I don't think it is a spoiler to give away the major ending here, in that Troy eventually falls, not to military might, but to trickery. The Greek ships have sailed, leaving only an offering to Poseidon behind - a giant horse. The Trojan Horse (if the Greeks built it, why is it always called 'the Trojan Horse?') is carted into the city whose walls cannot be breeched, and the people celebrate their victory. As they rest after the revelry, Greek soldier inside the horse emerge (including in this telling, Achilles), open the gates to the city, and the Greek army swarms in. However, the individual endings of the different characters is still left up in the air - who survives, and who doesn't? This is even more crucial than the pre-ordained destruction of the city.A nice touch to the film is the hand-off of the great sword of Troy to a young man named Aeneas, with the instruction that so long as a Trojan has the sword, Troy will live on (this connects to the Roman epic poem, the Aeneid, which tells of Aeneas' journey from Troy to Rome, making them the spiritual successors of Troy, particularly meaningful when the Romans then conquer the Greeks).",8.0,Anonymous,History
I don't understand!,"I watched it and I thought this movie was amazing! I'm one of the people that hasn't read Iliad, and I refuse to believe that if you haven't read it then you are stupid therefore you do enjoy the movie! And - I've been reading the other threads...I seem to be of a minority that think Brad acted really well! He was sooooo convincing as Achilles! The accent thing I did notice, but seriously, if you were enjoying the movie as much as I was then you would forget about it. miscast? i don't think so...and right now I cannot think of a better person to play Achilles...some suggestions?I do agree with the people that think Bloom can't act very well...his expressions are annoying lol. But I don't seem to be a very good judge of acting...I think most people act well! One last thing...Bloom didn't even touch Brad in looks and physique...how can anyone think otherwise? :D",9.0,Anonymous,History
Entertaining but irritating,"It's tough having majored in history, with a concentration on Ancient Greek and Near Eastern culture, and saying too much good about this movie. I do like it on one hand as it's action packed, has great fight scenes, and very good acting. The story moves along at a good pace and the characters are well done. It's an entertaining movie no doubt, and one that can be watched over and over and enjoyed.On the other hand, Troy is about as much about the Iliad as The Crucible was about the Salem Witch Trials. This movie is really just a thinly veiled allegory about the Iraq War with a bunch of barbs thrown at then-President Bush (""Imagine a king that fights his own battles,"" and ""20 thousand men come to fight for one man's greed,""). The story of poor men forced to fight an unjust war under false pretenses for one corrupt leader's greed doesn't need a genius to unravel what point it's trying to get across.Also included in the movie is the typical Hollywood disdain for religion. Every character who claims strong belief in the gods is shown to either be misguided, foolish, or vicious while Hector and Achilles, who claim they believe in the gods but largely scoff at them, are shown as wise and having the best grip on reality. The movie also throws a barb at the idea of afterlife, suggesting that the idea of a temporary, though flawed, existence is more attractive than the idea of living eternally, which Achilles claims would cause moments to lose their preciousness. The embrace of death and the devaluing of life is prevalent throughout. Whatever a viewer's personal philosophy is on religion, the world view shown in this movie is so far removed from Ancient Greek and Near Eastern thought that it's hard to take the movie seriously at many points.It's already been discussed in many other reviews where the movie deviated from the original story, or which characters should have been more prominent, so I won't go into that. My issue with the movie was that the creators were unable to divorce from their own world view enough to create a more authentic setting. Even if the creators wanted to make a movie without the gods as characters, it could have been done if the world view was more accurate.All that being said, I will conclude with the way I started: It's a fun movie that, if you turn off your intellectual side, you will enjoy.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Breathtaking !,"I must admit i wasn't to enthusiastic about watching 'Troy', but after doing so i thought it was one of the best films i have seen for a longtime. The cast is very good, each actor playing the role excellently. Brad Pitt shows his talent through this, from changing between warrior and falling in love with a certain lady he shouldn't. Diane Kruger who plays Helen - she looks stunning in this film, def passes off as the most beautiful women ever seen. I was very impressed with the fight scenes, my favourite being between Achilles and Hector quite tense. Its setting is pleasing to the eye, set in the grounds of Greece the scenery is amazing. I would definitely recommend this even if this really doesn't appeal2u, you will love it by the end ( so much so, i bought it the following day!)",10.0,Anonymous,History
Homophobic Trash,"The acting is awful, especially Brad Pitt who just postures around. The special effects do not save this movie. The worst insult, though, in this day and age, the beginning of the 21st century, is the perversion of facts through sheer homophobia. Achilles is drawn back into fighting because Hector killed Patroclus. Patroclus was his lover, not his ""cousin"", as it is repeated every time the character is mentioned. I could understand that a 1950's epic would somewhat obscure the fact that Achilles was gay or bisexual. Nowadays, it is unacceptable. It is not glossed over, but the lie is reinforced at every opportunity, which makes me believe it is not puritanism, but open homophobia. There are other historical inaccuracies, as in many movies, introduced for dramatic purposes. This doesn't hold water here: wouldn't it be more dramatic if Achilles returned to fighting to avenge his lover, not his ""cousin""?",1.0,Anonymous,History
One of the most exciting and gripping films I've ever seen,"An exceptional and sensitive treatment of the Homerian epic. The film is gripping from beginning to end and will keep you on the edge of your seat. Given the massiveness of the tale, the director is to be congratulated on sustaining appropriate complexity and human conflict. Where the film is flawed is not worthy of mention given the overall accomplishment. The film treatment is long (2 hours and over 40 minutes) but never boring. The violence is vivid but never gratuitous. The tenderness provides a fuller dimension to the characters and the story. The tragedy is a reminder of the human condition. At the end, one is left with a poignancy about what might have been.",,Anonymous,History
Lacking and uninspired,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie for two reasons: (1) it was supposedly based on Homer's Iliad and (2) it looked like it was made in the same vein as Gladiator. Unfortunately, neither predispositions were enough to rate this movie higher than ""fair.""To say this movie was based on The Iliad is, well, acceptable in so far as the characters and events are historically accurate, but other than that it's not a very genuine adaptation. Brad Pitt's portrayal of Achilles was bland, and his acting was as monotone as Ben Stein's voice.The action sequences should have been and could have been much better had they not been done with an overtone of utter blandness. They just didn't have the same spirit of large, grandiose battles like we've seen in Gettysburg, Braveheart or Gladiator.Orlando Bloom was a cowering simp in this movie, and if that was his intent for his portrayal of Paris, then he nailed it quite nicely. Otherwise, the movie would have been better off without him.The film's only saving grace was Eric Bana's portrayal of Hector and Sean Bean's depiction of Odysseus. They make the movie bearable for the two-plus hours I waited for this movie to take off - which, ultimately, it never really did. Troy falls well short of it's literary counterpart's brilliance.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A Truly Wonderful Film!,"This movie is amazing. The film moves with such a wonderful pacing and the action is awesome. That battle in front of Troy is such a wonderful spectacle. I just loved it. I think a lot of people are hard on this movie, and it's unjustified. It's an action/adventure epic that promises a war story with big battles, and that's exactly what it delivers. Some people say that the acting is bad, but it's not. And even if it is, why should that matter? Acting isn't exactly supposed to the be the strong point of this movie. It's the spectacle that is the attraction, and the spectacle in this movie is amazing. Why is that so hard for people to accept? Acting and story isn't everything. Anyway, the story was great IMO. There's a scene where Hector kills somebody, and the twist in that scene really surprised me, and the following scenes are amazing (Achilles learning of it, and then the fight between Achilles and Hector... wonderful!) I loved the Trojan Horse as well. Very well done. And the invasion of Troy was awesome. I loved everything. This sword and sandal epic is very entertaining. Don't expect great acting, and you won't be disappointed. And don't expect ""The Iliad"" from it either. If it was supposed to be ""The Iliad"", they would have called it ""The Iliad"". But they didn't, they called it ""Troy"", because it isn't ""The Iliad"". It's pretty simple! There's also an amazing scene in this movie, which has very good acting from Peter O'Toole, and also Brad Pitt. It's a very memorable scene, and quite powerful. I've never seen such a great performance of ""grieving father"" before.Overall, the movie exceeded my expectations. I went just expecting to see a bunch of great action scenes with good CGI. What I got was a bunch of great action scene with great CGI, and also a couple good scenes of emotion, and some good tension as well. Not to mention a great epic feel, and some good twists in the story. I liked it very much, and it deserves much more than what it's getting from the ungrateful audiences that films have today.

An Enjoyable and Exciting film,"I've seen Troy 3 times now; I watch films more than once often but only if they are truly worth it. Troy, for me, is worth it.If you like bulging muscles, tanned men, beautiful women, naked Brad Pitts, visually stunning scenery, amazing battle scenes, excellent stunts, some great acting, tear jerking moments, doe-eyed Orlando Blooms and Greek mythology then I would recommend this film for you.Don't expect it to follow the history or myth perfectly, this NEVER (well, very rarely) happens, and it never fails to gall me when people expect a perfect adaptation of a book/story/etc every time. Stop doing it. You are bound to be disappointed.I would mark Troy down though, because many of the actors attempted shoddy British accents, frankly - being British myself - I would rather they just did American cos they generally are really poor. But this is a minor issue really.Brad Pitt steals this film for me. He really makes you relate to Achilles and pity him. I was really routing for him throughout the film. He portrays the anger and pain Achilles is obviously feeling excellently and I wouldn't change anything about his performance.Orlando Bloom is a worthy addition to the cast but he doesn't really do much for the film as a whole as his scenes are short and he plays the character that everyone automatically dislikes; Paris. At the end he really comes through, and although you kind of hate him for what he does (you'll see what I mean) you begin to admire him.There are some tear jerking moments so if you - like myself - cry at films a lot I would keep the tissue box nearby!I can understand why Troy is not a 5 * film, but overall I think it's a really enjoyable film and worth watching!",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Troy is about the Trojan War, which took place about 1000 BC.","As far as I know, this story has been made into a movie only once before... Robert Wise's Helen of Troy (1955). Those who think that Troy is a travesty of the original should be lashed to a mast and forced to watch Helen of Troy (for which the story of Achilles is over with in 20 minutes.)I majored in Latin and classical literature, so I know the story of the Trojan War and the sources.There are a few things the screenwriter did (to change the original) which can be forgiven... and something you, as the audience can do, which will improve the viewing experience.The biggest problem for the screenwriter was to telescope a ten year war (which would have been incomprehensible to viewers) into a couple of weeks. Another problem was to take a story which was well known to those who heard it when it was first composed, 3,000 years ago or so, and make characters who could only appear for a few seconds into memorable characters.As the first reviewer mentioned, the Trojan Horse does not appear in the Iliad. Neither does the death of Achilles (from an arrow in his Achilles' tendon). Could a modern audience stand a story about Troy, however, which does NOT contain the few things about the story which he DOES know? For me, far more troubling is the ending, where Paris escapes with Helen from the burning city. This was added to make a nice happy ending... but in fact, Helen returned to her husband. If you don't believe me, read Homer's Odyssey, where Telemachus visits Sparta to look for his father... and meets Menelaus reunited with his wife, Helen.Cassandra may have a speaking part in the Iliad... I don't remember. Clytemnestra and her boyfriend did kill Agamemnon and Cassandra when they returned from the Trojan War, but did not serve his body up to their children... at least not in the Oresteia, by Aeschylus. Nor in Ovid's Metamorphoses, which goes over the same material. In Aeschylus' first play in the trilogy, the reasons for killing Agamemnon are complex... and fascinating.Now if you know the original story and don't want to be disturbed by the screenwriter's changes, the logical thing to do is to watch Brad Pitt's masterful creation of Achilles, and Sean Bean's surprising Odysseus. The remaking of the story can be endured... until just after the funeral of Hector, when Odysseus watches one of his men carving a wooden horse. At that point, the wise person will walk out of the theater or turn off the video or DVD and be left with a fairly satisfying experience. Everything after that point is a letdown. It even SEEMS like Hollywood changes to the story.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Nice adaptation...,"""Troy"" is a Drama - History movie in which we follow Homer's classic ""The Iliad"" and we watch how Menelaus travel to Troy with his brother Agamemnon and an army 50,000 of Greeks to get back Menelaus wife Helen. Achilles a notorious Greek warrior is going also to Troy with his army the Myrmidones.I liked this movie very much because the plot was interesting and despite the duration of it, it was not boring. The interpretations of Brad Pitt who played as Achilles, Brian Cox who played as Agamemnon and Eric Bana who played as Hector were very good and the combination of them worked very well. The direction which was made by Wolfgang Petersen was also very good and he did an excellent job on the adaptation of ""The Iliad"". All in all, I have to say that ""Troy"" is a nice movie to watch and if you are a fan of war movies I am sure that you will enjoy it very much.",7.0,Anonymous,History
maltreated - a great movie,"Bad movies come out in droves these days. The majority of critics must be on autopilot, bombing new releases left and right, because they missed this perfectly good movie and gave it the same shoddy treatment as the typical brainless blockbuster. But anybody with sense can see that ""Troy"" is clearly a cut (or ten) above the average summer fare. Beautiful sets, thrilling battles (particularly the one-on-one clashes), and a terrific ensemble cast elevate this film to the status of epic greatness. I wonder if it will be reassessed with kinder eyes in the future, when we're not all so cynical and burnt out from watching too many CGI spectacles.Common criticisms of this movie just don't hold up. Orlando Bloom makes a fey Paris, yes, but that's the nature of the character. Perhaps his love scenes don't give off enough heat, but they're merely a preamble to the real focus - the war itself. Brad Pitt is better than you've heard as Achilles; once again, the controversial aspect of his performance (he's sulky) is true to the original character. Of course, the real show-stealer is Eric Bana's Hector; after his lackluster and low-key performance as the Hulk, I didn't think much of him, but here Bana infuses Troy's greatest warrior with wisdom, power, and passion. If junk like ""Lord of the Rings"" nets Oscars, then Bana should definitely be up for Best Supporting Actor, but I doubt that'll happen.True, the movie is not particularly faithful to the original myths in many important respects. But it doesn't pretend to be anything but a modern re-interpretation; the title isn't ""Homer's Iliad,"" after all. It's pretty ridiculous that critics slam the movie for not sticking closely enough to a poetic work that is obviously an exaggerated and embellished account of the war. By eliminating the gods (their actual presence, not their influence), ""Troy"" makes the Trojan War seem more real than it was in ""The Iliad,"" and that's not a bad thing. It was a real war, after all (probably). And I'll bet the gods didn't show up in reality, either...Perhaps ""Troy"" has too much moral grey area for modern audiences, who have grown accustomed to black-and-white, good-vs-evil conflicts from both the movies (Star Wars, LOTR) and the political rhetoric of the day. But I love the ambiguity in this movie, and every time a character dies - whether he's Greek or Trojan - I feel bad. I never know which side is really right, which side I want to win. That's because the story has genuine complexity; nice to know that Hollywood is still capable of generating something with more than a surface layer of gloss.""Troy"" is also exceedingly manly, which could be alienating, as it celebrates not only combat and good muscle tone but such outdated concepts as honor, duty, and courage. Watching this, I couldn't help but think we're all complete wimps these days, in terms of our fallen virtues as well as our flabby bodies. But I'm drifting into weird territory now. Suffice to say that ""Troy"" is a beautiful and underrated story of honor, love, and cool battles between cool characters. Try to catch it in the theaters while you still can; epics always look their best on the big screen.",9.0,Anonymous,History
if it's the Iliad then it wouldn't be titled Troy.,"i wanted very much to watch Troy since i watched the trailer. in fact i don't know the complete story about the Trojan War. As i heard from many comments that Troy was narrated from Homer's Iliad so i purchased an electronic version of the Iliad and spent almost 10 days reading it.at last i went to watch Troy with some friends. I was amazed, this is nothing the Iliad. what's the problem with some people and some critics, this isn't the Iliad, this is the Trojan War so we can't fail a movie just for not matching the original text.in my viewpoint, the movie was about the Trojan War and the Iliad was the only written text available so the makers of Troy used the Iliad as their original raw material. we all know that the Iliad started with the tenth and last year of Troy besiege and finished with the death of Hector but the movie goes far beyond.i admire the talent of Wolfgang Petersen, he made a movie, another version of the wellknown Iliad. Maybe Homer created the Iliad from nothing and Petersen created his own version, who knows?. In fact this movie deserves the money spent on it because without its special effects it would be nothing. Some say that it was easier for Petersen to make the movie this way, i mean giving up all the Gods, the events we didn't see in the movie but i say that it was very much harder for him to change it into this form. In fact it was more convincing, i mean who cares about Gods and myths in such a movie. many people would love Troy just for being Troy even if they know nothing about the original story.there were some scenes that really were familiar, others needed some explanation. for example the scene when Odysseus is accompanied by some warriors to ask Achilles to participate in the war, doesn't it remind you of ""Mission Impossible 2"". one other scene, when Achilles is holding Briseis after the fall of Troy and Paris launches his arrow into Achilles' heel, he seems to lose power and die. many friends of mine were amazed by that. Does a hero like Achilles die because of an arrow in the heel, they needed some explanation from the Iliad to accept it, maybe through the movie someone had to mention that Achilles was invulnerable to wounds through out his body except his heel.any way the movie is a master piece of Wolfgang Petersen who saved it in many twists especially that the dialogue was so naive. consider watching it muted, that will change nothing.while Brad Pitt and Eric Bana were a real heroes, Diane Kruger and Orlando Bloom did nothing just looking very naive and silly, they never looked in love.Troy will never meet your expectations whether high or low.

"Whoops, it's rubbish","What with all the anticipation for the macho thunder epic 300's imminent release, fans of bloody historical battles in movies may be tempted as I was to go back and re-watch Wolfgang Peterson's Troy as a warm up. However, I'd strongly advise against it. My first impression of the movie when it came out a few years back was that it was decent enough but ultimately forgettable and a poor runner up to Gladiator's success. A second viewing nowadays reveals the full extent of Troy's weaknesses and it is undeniably a very poor film, trading any worthy story or acting for spectacle and leaving us with a rather shallow interpretation of an epic conflict.Set a really, really, really long time ago, the film sees the ruthless Agamemnon (Brian Cox), King of the Greek Empire looking for an excuse to invade his equally powerful neighbour, the nation of Troy. When his brother Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson) is humiliated by his wife Helen (Diane Kruger) running off with Paris (Orlando Bloom), prince of Troy, Agamemnon realises his chance and sets sail with a vast armada of warships, crammed to the hilt with Greek warriors in pursuit of conquest. And suckered into this high body-count soap opera come a variety of classical Greek characters, each with his own stamp to leave on the tale.On the plus side, despite being ""based on"" Homer's 'The Illiad,' Peterson makes clear this is not a direct transcription of the story. As a result, he jettisons the Gods from the proceedings, reduces the length of the war from ten years to a few months and focuses squarely on the fighting and the people involved. Thus, we are saved the sight of celestial super beings interfering in events and are given a rather straightforward war story. The downside of this however is that somehow, Peterson has managed to make what should have been an Earth shattering conflict come across as more of a quiet little skirmish.Take for example the initial beach landing as the Greek armada lands on Trojan soil. Leading the charge is Brad Pitt's Achilles who has raced ahead of the rest of the fleet in order to show off. Achilles and his men then go on to win the battle almost entirely by themselves in a logic defying leap designed to show just how dangerous the man is meant to be. Unfortunately, it fails to do so and instead makes the Trojan military force come across as a woefully inept bunch of losers who were lucky to survive this long, their response to Pitt and co landing on their shores being a pathetic flight of arrows when in truth, they should have been wiped out almost immediately by a hail of death.This doesn't bode well but things begin to brighten up when Agamemnon leads an assault on the city itself. The sight of the huge Greek army piling into the equally-huge Trojan force is the most visually spectacular moment of the film, but sadly it's all over too soon. The subsequents reprisals and the eventual climax to the war can only disappoint, the movie whimpering when it should roar.The acting meanwhile is a game of two halves. On the one hand, there is the likes of Sean Bean as Odysseus and Pete O'Toole's King Priam lending some heavyweight class, plus Eric Bana's fantastic portrayal of the heroic Hector who is easily the best thing about the movie. Then there is Orlando Bloom's nondescript Paris, Brian Cox's spoilt brat Agamemnon and Brad Pitt's Achilles doing their level best to scupper everything. Indeed, a lot of the time it feels as though the film is turning into a Brad Pitt vanity project, the camera lingering all over him as he pouts into the lens. Somewhat worryingly, he also spends the majority of the film stark naked, turning Achilles from an all powerful force of the Gods into a narcissistic nudist.These gripes aside, what ultimately wrecks Troy's aspirations of greatness comes in another common-sense defying scene in the later half that puts even the beach assault to shame with its crass stupidity. With both sides drained, morale low and stricken with tragedy, King Priam disguises himself and sneaks into the Greek camp to talk with Achilles in a moment of desperation. Yes, you didn't read that incorrectly, THE KING WALTZES INTO THE ENEMY CAMP IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR TO HAVE A CHAT WITH THEIR CHAMPION AND NOBODY THINKS TO MENTION IT. I mean come on, surely someone in the studio system must have noticed this rather glaring piece of idiocy and pointed out to the director how incredibly stupid it was? Needless to say, this is not a good movie. One impressive battle scene and a charismatic Eric Bana are not enough to save it from drowning under it's own flabby excess. It flits between a classical tale, a war story and a Brad Pitt love-in session with a worrying ease and leaves the impression that ancient Greece was nothing but a glorified soap opera. Gladiator and Kingdom of Heaven frankly, leave it in the dust. Here's hoping 300 rekindles the Greek pride.",3.0,Anonymous,History
"Ancient Greece? No, but here's the sexy playstation version","Thank goodness movies are fiction. This idea works well for much of the American film industry  after all events outside of the U.S. are either Not Important or Never Really Happened. Add big battles, sex, special effects and a notional wave at reality and you can find the downpayment on a few more Roads to Glory.This approach to film making can be justified in that it can raise the spirits of the masses. Not just in the U.S.  Bollywood, for instance, puts a smile on the faces of millions of Indians living in poverty. Back in the U.S. of A., it rallied spirit of troops for WWII and gave hope to the worried families back home that there was hope somewhere Over the Rainbow.For today's fattened (if artistically impoverished) viewers, movies such as Troy feel like a too-good-to-miss extra large helping of Death by Chocolate when we're already too sated to move. We already know the sensorama ingredients give nothing of value to us but they're nice anyway. Brad Pitt's immaculately oiled body is nearly every woman's fantasy hero as the valiant, sensitive, warrior-supremo Archilles. Orlando Bloom is Paris, tender but useless, adorable (if morally bankrupt) and with a make-love-not-war brigade expression (ie don't fight wars, you big pussy, just cause them by stupid, hedonistic indifference.) His love' of (dumb blonde) Helen is the nominal excuse for the war that launches a thousand ships and results in the sacking of Troy when she is swept off her feet by Trojan Paris from her nasty Greek husband. Helen, after a few nothing-to-do-with-me moral disclaimers, becomes the role model fro every female that aspires to an over-inflated ego.The credits mention the story is related to Homer's Iliad, but apart from name dropping and iconised events from general mythology such as the Wooden Horse, there is little of Homer's genius or subtlety, just as there is little that is identifiably Greek. There are many American and British actors prancing about with swords and overblown histrionics, making little or no attempt to disguise their accents, mannerisms or the fact that they are film stars. Within these parameters however, there are some enjoyable performances, particularly Peter O'Toole as the worthy King Priam, struggling to do the right thing for both his subjects and his offspring, and whom Achilles respects more than his own power-hungry king.Excellent use of computer generated graphics means we can have convincingly enormous armies in epic battle scenes, and the pacing a story are sufficiently well constructed to entertain us for nearly three hours.For anyone who found Lord of the Rings too fantasy-laden or Gladiator too bloody, Troy may well be the ideal Saturday afternoon family entertainment. Nothing wrong with a bit of harmless fiction after all . . .",7.0,Anonymous,History
The legend re-born,"I am grateful for how well this was handled. Thoroughly expecting the romance to take centre stage in the narrative (as has been the case in many costly movies of late), between Paris (Bloom) and Helen (Kruger), I remember thinking, as I left the theatre, how little screen time they shared together. Benioff and Petersen have instead simply given us The Trojan War as fought by the two great warriors of that age: Hector (Bana) and Achilles (Pitt).The story has always been a great one, but never satisfactorily rendered on the big screen. These Greek legends hold the origins of modern storytelling, but where are they now? Cinema has barely touched the richness of ancient folklore: maybe now is its time, as special effects become more miraculous by the week, and studios are embracing the scope of epic fantasy and history like never before. Where are the great movies of Hercules, of Theseus, of Odysseus...'Troy' was terrific entertainment. The battles are everything you'd expect, and comparing them to Helm's Deep or Pelennor Fields is unfair in the extreme. This is gritty, chaotic warfare in which good and evil isn't as clear-cut as men vs orcs; Homer saw it as bravery fighting destiny, and that is precisely what is presented here.Pitt is perfect as the arrogant but soulful Achilles, a warrior so deadly that his renown can literally turn the tide of a war. The actor displays a breathtaking physicality here, superhuman in both agility and grace. His presence fills the screen in every way. Bana is hugely impressive as noble Prince Hector, the only real bona-fide hero of the film. He radiates strength through every word, and is a commanding presence throughout. His performance is comparable to Russell Crowe's 'Maximus'.Most notable among the high calibre cast are Peter O'Toole (wonderful as King Priam), Brian Cox's loathsome Agamemnon and Sean Bean (fantastic as the fabled Odysseus). No one is conspicuously weak, but many roles are unfortunately only given the focus that a (quite strong) three hour script can provide. Sets are stupendous, costumes dazzling and the special effects are as grand as you'd imagine.Special mention must go to the climactic one-on-one fight between the two warriors. It's a truly amazing five minute sequence of cinema.The film as a whole works very well indeed, and the changes given to the original story (apart from one) are handled admirably. Ranks easily among the best historical epics of yesteryear, and offers a fascinating interpretation of the legendary Achilles. An impressive, old-fashioned extravaganza.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Battle Between Hector and Achilles,"I had very high expectations for Troy. Why wouldn't I. The Battle of Troy is the one story that has overcome time and lived for over 3000 years. The epic battles, the powerful characters, and most importantly, the beautiful women. To be brutally honest, Troy fell short in every aspect. If there was one thing that could have saved the movie, it would have been the battle between Hector and Achilles outside the Trojan walls. I was expecting a ten minute battle, a sequence that would have done justice to probably one of the greatest battles of ALL TIME. It didn't. It was unemotional and simply lacked creativity. To venture from the battle and discuss casting, Brad had his moments. He comes across as a hard brute, exactly what he should have been. It was not until half way through the movie, where his emotions started peeking through, that I began to enjoy his performance. To me, he just seemed distant and not in the moment. On the other hand, Peter O'Toole, the king of Troy, was AMAZING. My favorite sequence was when the Trojan Horse was brought into the city and the Greeks began to burn Troy to the ground, and the camera cuts to Peter O'Toole looking over it all. That shot had a lasting impression on me for the rest of the film (which was about 4 minutes), and only Peter O'Toole could have pulled it off. AMAZING job.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Biased review, film buffs look elsewhere","For a Greek who was raised by these stories as part of his heritage and history to actually see them unfold in front of him is a really huge thing.I got to see the film yesterday in Odeon's flagship cinema in Leicester square. Only the best would do for such a story. Since my knowledge of the story rivals your average scholar let me provide you with some (just scratching the surface though), information about it.The story you get to witness in Troy is not taken by one book. Homer's Iliad takes place in about 40-50 days of the 9-10 year war against the Trojans. The book actually ends with Hector's funeral. NO Trojan horse, or Achilles death etc. The story you get to see on screen is 85% Homer's (huge dispute about that as well, but i am not going to get into it) and the rest comprises by accounts and stories we have from different authors. I would estimate that about 60% of the story is taken from The Iliad, (as the credits rightly inform the story was inspired by the works of Homer, NOT Simpson)Yes changes have been made, like in other movies, in order to take account of the cinema generation. The script is written so as to give an account of the possible factual happenings thus deferring from all the divine intervention complications as in the original text.You see this story is not your Mummys or your Lord of the rings or your Harry Potters. The story is about a historical event that actually happened 3200 (?) years ago. You can go to modern day Turkey and visit the ruins of Troy. For years scholars were accusing the stories as fantasy. Heinrich Schliemann shut them up when he discovered the ruins of the historical Troy. That was only about 100 years ago. So do not dismiss anything from the story. King Agamemnon and his brother Menelaus were actual Kings, their palaces exist to this day, ancient Greeks did dressed like that, had ships like that etc etc. The costume designers didn't have to leave their imagination running. They just visited a few archaeological museums.Nowadays you can visit New Zealand and be taken upon the tourist trail of Lord of the Rings. You`ll be shown the filming locations like they were the factual locations. That's what a nation without heritage does nowadays. They fake it. Whereas, you can visit Greece and stumble upon the birth of civilization, upon stories and legends on a time when humanity was born, a time before modern religions (Christianity, Islam etc), a time before weapons of mass destruction. Well enough with that, you get the picture.Back on the movie. When I first heard that they were going to make a movie about the story of Troy I was thinking that they were going to create a simple action movie or worse, a tongue in cheek version in the veins of The Mummy. I was relieved to see that Petersen actually managed to put lots of heart into it, people around me were crying all the time, I couldn't cry, I cried many times decades ago when I was first taught the story, (part of the education curriculum in Greece for centuries).Most of the location filming was done in Malta so you get a fair representation of the actual historic locations. The soundtrack is dipped in ancient Greek music (Pythagorean scale) and costumes/armory/buildings/weapons are highly representative of the period, as I mentioned before a simply visit to a museum would suffice.I am taking my hat off to the people who did the research for the movie. They really did their homework, especially in the correct representation of the city of Troy and hints regarding actual shenanigans, (according to Herodotus, the father of history, Helen was actually in Egypt during the war, Menelaus collected her upon returning from his victory). Of course I have to forgive them for many false representations, since they had to make a story viable for current (easy going) generations. For instance, at that time there wasn't a collective term for Greeks. In fact, if such a generalization is to be made it has to be said that the Trojans were Greeks as well, (the Thracians, which take their name from the part of modern day Greece where I actually came from, where allies with Troy). I suggest you do your own reading upon that.The story is about a war, and war you get in the big screen version. Huge battle scenes with bird's eye shots of countless battleships (triiris), battalion formations etc. Achilles was the greatest warrior at that time (immortal apart from his heel, according to legend) and you get to see why. Again, unlike the Matrix let's say, these warriors existed and fought like that a long time ago. Back then it was all about the heroes and their honour. You will see in the movie that Achilles wants his name in history. This testament is not just something taken of the books, these men really did lived and died for that cause alone. Honour and Arete.Greeks to this day, still name their kids using these names. Just think about the history of your name and then try to compare that with a young kid living in Greece who is called Achilles.It's the year 2004A.D. and these historic figures, thanks to cinematography, are more famous than ever before. Do you really think they died in vain?Welcome to the greatest stories ever told.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The (more) realistic approach,"For better or for worse, this doesn't feature any of the gods of the myth. In fact, it apparently takes steps to eliminate the mythical aspects from Homer's epic poem... again, not everyone is going to like that. So this is a realistic(somewhat... it *is* Hollywood) retelling of the much-disputed story. Technically speaking, the film is good. The production values are rather high. The cinematography and editing are both quite skillful, and the epic shots covering the mass armies and locales are well-done. The acting is great, all-round. The story is played around with, details changed around, to fit the film they wanted to make. This tells both the story of the fall of Troy, and the stories of the people(though perhaps more the men than the women) on both sides of the conflict. The film will appeal to both genders, us men can look at all the war scenes, and the women can look at Pitt and Bloom bare-chested. The action is fairly accomplished... the camera-work, editing and choreography are all reasonably well-done. There is intensity in the fights and war scenes. There is some sexuality in the film. There is also violence, which I thought was the right choice, to not water down scenes of war(ones that may have actually been fought, no less). I don't know that it was ever gratuitous or over the line. I suppose this is a good watch for those who don't want the gods and other mythical elements(I won't say ""the story"", because I don't know that this is particularly accurate, in fact, all I've heard indicates the opposite to be far closer to the truth), and/or those who want to watch action set during that period. I recommend this to those who fall into the aforementioned groups, but any historians may want to steer clear, as well as anyone else looking for an account that sticks to the known facts closely. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
Peter O'Toole gives his best performance in a long time,"Peter O'Toole may just be one of the reasons to go see Troy. Sure, its a big budget epic with special effects and fight scenes galore, but the acting by O'Toole wins the show. While half of the performances fall short of anything Hollywood like, O'Toole picks up the pieces and gives an amazing supporting role as King of Troy. The role of Paris and Helen both fall short with hardly any substance or character development. Paris gains no interests nor is he anywhere positive, Helen is nothing but ""skin."" No substance besides 3 seconds of nudity that make up her entire being. The movie may fall short with story, but like Homer's version, you have to like the genre to enjoy the movie. Troy will win some awards for its production and for Mr. O'Tooles terrific acting, otherwise, nothing else to see here except your garden variety epic with a giant budget",6.0,Anonymous,History
beauty in boys not helen,"troy was brilliant. i loved every part of this movie, but one...diane kruger. helen was supposed to be the most beautiful woman in the world, and not only is diane kruger not that, she isn't even the most beautiful woman in the movie. i suppose it would be hard to be on screen surrounded by beautiful actors and actresses and have to live up to being the prettiest, but i think they could have found someone who would have had an easier time at it. the action was amazing, the acting good, and the casting almost perfect. orlando and eric look so alike, that it was hard to believe that they aren't real brothers. brad pitt stunned me with his buff body and angry persona, with the sensitivity oozing out all the rough edges. talk about an all star cast to make a movie bigger than life...i suppose that is just what was needed to put together a movie based on a story so grand itself.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Great epic movie,"What a good epic movie, with some drama on it. It was great. The setting was real and very natural. Good job. Its war was the biggest and full of action. From the first time I saw the trailer, I promised I won't missed it. After I watched, I felt so great.Orlando Bloom was the reason why I wanted to watch this movie. After his performance as Legolas, I knew he would be look good played as Prince Paris. He looked cute and innocent as Paris. But as a looser prince, he knows nothing. He only knows Helen.I like Eric Bana played Prince Hector. You are the man, Eric. The character was so unforgettable. He is the real hero. He hated his brother did that big mistake, but it's hard to leaved his brother. It was so so so sad when he died. Troy had lose the greatest prince.Poor King Priam. He absolutely loved his sons. But, o my God. He kissed the hands of a man who killed his son, Achilles. If I'm Priam, I won't do that. What I do is kill Achilles. And I like most of Priam quotes. It is very touching me.I was not really interested with Brad Pitt as Achilles. I think he acted too hard and it made the character not natural. He acted too persist. First, Achilles was a strong guy and everybody scared of him. And then, suddenly he weeped over Hector's body. What is this?!It's a good movie to see. An epic movie with a legend story.

This movie is ... G R E A T,"I show this movie with great interest , as i heard about it much from my friend. I regret that i show TROY on computer , actually it should be seen on big screen only , so you can realize how amazing this movie is going on with lots of interest and action. This movie is quite different that i ever show before this. All the characters are ""MIND BLOWING"". My favorite characters : Hector and Achilles. Brad Pitt has shown nice bravery and hector also. My favorite seen is that "" Hector & Achilles war "" , where Hector died. It was a really great fight that show with full interest & action , perhaps more than Jackie Chan's fight. I can say that the troy and Menelaus had already settled peace. But Paris brought Helen to Troy.And the real story started.Well after all those movements , i found that it was a great war for LOVE of Paris & Helen , where Troy paid a lot , Hector - A True Warrior.Well if you still haven't seen the movie , just go to theater only and ENJOY THE TROY.",,Anonymous,History
"Enjoyable, but could've been so much more substantial","I really enjoyed Troy for the most part, but it's severely lacking in places and there are big problems caused by some of the changes to Homer's text.Actionwise it's spectacular. Wolfgang Petersen's direction is perfunctory at best (imagine what a visionary like Peter Jackson or an action expert like Ridley Scott could've done with the material). The scale of it all is so great though, that such a problem doesn't impact too greatly on the entertainment value. There are literally thousands of warriors on screen slugging it out, and because so many real people have been used, there's no way of saying who are real extras and where the vfx begins. The fights aren't as dynamic as Gladiator's (the first of many times where I feel the need to compare the two) but there's plenty of punch and scale to it all. It's at it's best during the one on one moments, especially the Achilles vs Hector duel. There's an almost balletic quality to the way it has been choreographed, it's certainly not shot to look like your average bit of gladiatorial violence.In between action sequences the characters and plotting are diverting enough. Peter O'Toole especially gives proceedings a genuine gravitas as Trojan King Priam. Eric Bana does a very good job as Hector, he's got a good screen presence about him and there were moments where I felt genuinely moved by his performance, in his defense of Paris, his final night with his wife as he holds his baby son and his final march down to face his doom. As some have mentioned Orlando Bloom is very much his standard self, but it seems right for the role he is playing, Paris is after all a legendary ladies man. I never particularly got the feeling he was in love with Helen, but there scenes together did enough to suggest it to me. Diane Kruger's Helen is similar to be honest, nothing stand out, but it's functional enough to move the plot along.And what of the much talked about Brad Pitt. For me his portrayal of Achilles is at times hopeless. He's fine at the physical stuff and during the stroppy Achilles phase he does well, but the moment the role calls for any amount of emotion it goes to pieces. His reaction to the death of Patroclus his cousin felt like a whiny kid who'd just had his new toy taken away. And here's where the Gladiator comparison really does Troy no favours at all. You compare Pitt's feeble attempt at emotion to Russell Crowe's powerhouse display as Maximus. You want a broken man driven to revenge, take a look a Crowe, we've got rage, sadness, tears, the man even gives us snot. The scene where he collapses to his knees upon finding his family murdered says it all. OK maybe it's a bit harsh to compare a guy reacting to his cousin's death to a man who's just lost his wife and kid, and the diversion from Homer here doesn't help much either, seeing as Patroclus was Achilles's 'dear' friend, but come on he's practically untroubled by it all. Seeing as Petersen has set out to make a Gladiatoresque film, rather than giving us Homer's rich mythology, such a scene is vital and I thought it failed. Any scene from there onwards Pitt struggles, as he also does in showing passion for his lover Breiseis. That's a love that feels superficial, he might as well have won her in the lottery.Anyway I could go on about Pitt's performance all day, suffice to say he may as well have been in a coffee shop with Jennifer Aniston, which is probably my main problem with his casting. He felt to contemporary, not 'dirty' enough to play such a role, nor hard enough.Mention must be made of the music. James Horner is quite frankly a hack of a composer, something I've thought since Titanic, which was pretty much his score to Braveheart with a few extra bits. This is heavily pilfered from Gladiator, so we get the chanting melodies for sad scenes and the big chords for the battles. The difference being that Hans Zimmer has talent and produced something that felt fresh. The lyrical beauty of Lisa Gerrard's vocals is hoplelessly ripped off, especially as they were often used to score the more abstract moments of Gladiator, while Troy is very much a by the numbers movie.Anyway for a film I'd still rate seven out of ten, I've been heavily critical of it. It is entertaining, which for cinema is very important to me. This was supposed to be a contender for film of the year though, an Oscar hopeful, and it doesn't live up to that. Even if it hadn't been hyped so heavily, it would still be a waste of a great piece of Greek mythology. Troy has very little to do with the Illiad at all, except for containing the same characters. Stripped of the sense of adventure and the fantastical aspects this is a generic sword and sandals picture. People who haven't read any Greek lit, try for a moment and imagine the Lord of the Rings movies being based entirely around Helm's Deep and Pellenor Fields and you have some idea of how Troy has been adapted. I just feel they may as well have written an original script if this is what they planned to do. As a sword and sandals picture it pales next to Gladiator, as well as the older precedents Spartacus and Ben Hur. As an adaptation of The Illiad it's greatest crime is that we will never now see it as it should've been, on screen. Oh well it diverted my attention for 2 1/2 hours at least.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"Decent, thanks to Eric Bana's great performance.","Troy is mainly about the warrior Achilles, played by a mediocre Brad Pitt, and the battle between Greece and Troy, but it is also about vengeance, love, pride and sacrifice. The acting in this movie is not great, but some actors deliver fine performances. This includes Eric Bana in particular, but also Brian Cox, Rose Byrne and Sean Bean. Brad Pitt is good most of the time, but he delivers some of his lines badly. I usually do not like Orlando Bloom's acting, and sadly this is no exception. I enjoy most of his movies, but he is by all means no great actor. The battle scenes and the special effects are good, but the movie is missing something. It leaves you satisfied, but nothing more. It's pretty clear that director Wolfgang Petersen wants something more with this movie, but he seems a bit unoriented and confused. But the movie is still very entertaining, and it is by all means no bad movie.

Encompassingly Awesome! (With a side of beautiful Brad;),"All that needs to be said about this masterpiece of a film is that it is an absolutely awesomely fantastic movie, and is understandably adored my many, myself included! Eric Bana is amazing in this film. The PERFECT Hector; He fits the role as if he were made for it (Reincarnation, anyone?;) Also, Brad Pitt gives the performance of his life as Achilles. He manages to be savage, tender, and fierce at the same time. He should have won an Oscar for his body alone, let alone the great performance. Orlando Bloom does cowardly very well; surprisingly well, actually. He's the ideal Paris, despite his cinematic failings as a monarch. Helen and Hector's wife are played by very talented actresses who obviously did their homework when it comes to these roles. I just can't stress the casting enough. It's one of the best talent line-ups I've ever come across; also, the cinematography is beautiful. All in all, the film is a sheer delight to behold. It's entertaining and informative, and I definitely think they did Homer's 'Illiad' Justice.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A Missed Opportunity,"They give you beefed up Brad, who doesn't do bad as Achilles, though some more spear splintering rage like the Beach assault, rather than moping petulance might have made it better, an acting talent of an Eric Bana to portray a convincingly noble and believable Hector, O'Toole to deliver a heartbreaking Priam, a menacing enough Menelaus from Gleeson, though not near enough of ""Menelaus, the best of men"", and a passable Helen from the beautiful Kruger and whimpy enough Paris from Bloom--and all the CGI that one movie could eat, --AND the most riveting story of the last 3000 years and what do we get? Not near enough Sean Bean, no use of Diomedes as a character, AND FOR THE LOVE OF MIKE, LLAMAS!!!! No kidding LLAMAS skittering through the panic shot as the alarm is raised (Those long-venturing Acheans must have had some really dandy trade routes). Then 10 years are compressed into one, Achilles sneaks into town in the Trojan horse long after he died, Agamemnon, (a nice portrayal here as well) gets killed by Briesis rather than Clytemnestra back home and Menelaus gets his from Hector, instead of ""falling in love at the sight of golden Helen's breasts"" and taking her home. Come on, didn't anybody read the book? And what's wrong with the gods showing up from time to time? The Greeks thought they were there and played roles in the war. Divien intervention doesn't mean they had to get the Ray Harryhausen treatment to make use of them. Peterson didn't have to have them visible at all, just the effect of their action. So now we get a half-good treatment of the war at Troy. Now the opportunity to do full honor to the Iliad is likely gone on the multi-million buck budget for this under-performing epic shortfall.",6.0,Anonymous,History
my favorite one.  a masterpiece,"Troy was and remains my favorite movie ever. The first time I watched Troy I was stunned. I didn't think that movie would change forever my top. I was truly impressed by the acting, the story, the fight scenes and most of all, the love story between Achilles and Briseis which deeply impressed me. All he wanted was glory, and this movie is a story of Achilles, the hero, the super man, the soldier that obey no one but himself, but at the end, his desire of immortality, of glory is left away by his love for the beautiful cousin of prince Hector and Prince Paris, Briseis. I loved also the battle scenes, especially the one between Achilles and Hector. I must say I think this movie is the best of Pitt's, and in my opinion, he deserved to win an Oscar for this movie. Also I liked Eric Bana and Peter O'Toole as actors in this movie.

A Drama That Leads To Nowhere,"Before I start my review I must confess that I haven't read Homer's ""The Illyad"", but from what I can gather, the epic poem reads a lot better than this movie. I found TROY very confusing; I think that rooting for one character would help, but you end up feeling pity for Achilles (Brad Pitt), who is portrayed as a ruthless, heartless mercenary, hellbent on being ""THE"" warrior. At the end, you don't feel any sorrow nor pity for anyone...you kind of wish everyone dies, which they eventually do so. The scenery, the CGI fx and the overall acting is OK, although I have my doubts about Brad Pitt's casting...he's just ""too"" Hollywood, if you get my meaning. Still, he gets the job done with a decent performance. Eric Bana does great as Hector. Another miscast would be Orlando Bloom as Paris, Hector's kid brother. I think we've seen enough of Mr.Bloom in other ""Epic"" pictures...his agent should try to diversify his client's movie offers. For a moment, I thought I was going to get a GLADIATOR 2 kind of movie. It is similar (due to the period setting and overall feel), but where as GLADIATOR was wise and had a rapid pace, this one is slow and contrived. Again, I think I should read Homer's poem. Nice movie if you plan to rent a DVD on a Sunday night (by the way, TROY is already out on DVD here in Mexico and NO, it's not a bootleg!!!)7* out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A poor version of a great story,"Like a gourmet dinner after the chef forgot to add the Salt, this should have been a great movie that just doesn't work. The casting is wrong, the changes to the story are wrong, and the movie is just slow for a three hour action flick.Someone decided to write out the Greek Gods from the story and make it, ""Real."" This destroys much of the motivation of the characters and the reasons why things happen. BIG mistake.Brad Pitt is not a ""Great, Strong Warrior"" he's a pretty boy. The choreographed fights don't work because Achilles is supposed to be strong and skillful not possess a unique fighting style.History tells us that Agamemnon and Menelaus survive the battle of Troy and bring Helen home. History also tells us that Paris, Andromache(Hector's wife) and Hector's son are killed. Why did they need to change these facts?It was painful to watch someone rewrite a classic 3000 year old story and lose the lessons it contained.

To all would-be critics - think before you yap!,"One thing I find more loathsome than others is people who think that the world cannot do without their criticism. I realise that I, by criticising people who criticise, am placing myself in the same category. Nonetheless, I cannot refrain from doing so anyway, however, my critcism is directed at the critics of “Troy” by Wolfgang Petersen: Are all of you bright, super-intelligent critics who have supplied your comments, grandly supplying a list of the one hundred thousand things that did not correspond to either the “Iliad” or classical Greek mythology really so naive as to believe that the producers of the film were ignorant of the above? Here is logic for you: If I were going to produce a film on any subject, especially a classical one - and Homer's epic is THE literary work of art par excellence - I would spend ample time collecting material. I would also realise that, granted that the world is full of students of classical literature, there would be more scrutiny on the part of the public than in other cases. So why, for pity's sake, would you assume that Wolfgang Petersen would not have researched into the material prior to producing the film? That being the case, then, there must be another reason why the film is the way is and no different. Well - all I can say is that the producer took advantage of that thing known as artistic licence; also, the film is not titled “the Iliad” but “Troy”. Technically, of course, it’s the same subject since “Troia” and “Ilion” are two names for the same city (from Tros and Ilos, two of Priam’s ancestors, respectively), but still, by giving the film the name “Troy” it can be assumed that some amount of artistic licence is going to be taken. Regarding the comment by “Stephen Oestereicher” referring to “Brad Pitt” as being a “pretty boy”: If you read both the Iliad and the classical myths dealing with the pre-history of the War of Troy, you will find that Achilles was, indeed, a “pretty boy”! Due to the oracle stating that Achilles would lose his life in the War of Troy, his mother Thetis hid him on the isle of Skyros with King Lycomedes where he grew up with Lycomedes’ daughters. When, on the eve of the War, Odysseus came to summon Achilles, he had to use a ruse to distinguish Achilles from the girls. Does that tell you anything about the features of Achilles? So really, Brad Pitt gave a rather good rendering of Achilles, who combines in his person a number of opposites: He is both lofty AND emotional; he is both arrogant AND tender-hearted; he is both virile AND youthful - even child-like at times, with distinctly feminine features even (how else could he have been hidden unnoticed amongst girls?) – he is both “loved by the gods” AND a “mother’s boy” who runs to Mummy to be comforted. In short, the character of Achilles is indeed a perplexing one to analyse, but I think that Brad Pitt rendered it rather well. All right, so Brad Pitt’s Achilles was slightly more “golden haired” than is described in the Iliad, where Achilles has brown hair; but that’s really the only thing that did not correspond to the character of Achilles. There were, obviously, elements that were not mentioned in the film altogether, such as Achilles being entreated by a committee to return to battle, or his near drowning in the Scamander river (“Am I to drown like an imbecile?”) or his frequent running to his mother Thetis and crying his heart out to her, which constitutes part of the oddity of Achilles’ character; however, that which was brought across was not bad at all. As to the comparison with ""Helen of Troy"": Granted that Helen of Troy goes more into the pre-history of the Iliad, such as Theseus’ robbing Helen (which, actually, isn’t even elaborated on in the Epic Cycle but simply stated as a fact!) and telling her the truth behind her birth, or the origin of the vow of the Greek kings to support one another in battle if one of them was offended (although, according to the classics, it was Tyndareos himself who chose Menelaos as Helen’s husband), nevertheless, the latter part of the film is very much condensed due to lack of time, obviously because too much went into the beginning of the film. In short, where “Troy”, misrepresents certain items, “Helen of Troy” does the same with others. By the way: Briseis really WAS the lover of Achilles, so why do some of you insist that that shouldn't have been there? Feel free to contact me at Artemis.Lachanidou@gmx.net if you wish to argue more.",,Anonymous,History

Achilles is the intended tragic hero of the Iliad, but I found that throughout the film, we don't seem to learn enough about Achilles to truly feel great emotion for him.

Very entertaining movie - highly recommended,"Being of Greek ancestry, I thought the British accents, Peter O'Toole's(Priam) accent for example seemed very out of place. That being said, the scene where King Priam begs Achilles to let him give his son a proper burial was quite powerful and touching. I didn't like the idea of glamour boy Brad Pitt playing the part of Achilles. I also thought that an actor with more classical Greek features should have played the part, but then again Achilles was supposed to have golden hair.In the end, I thought Pitt did a better than average job of playing that role. His dialogue with Briseies where he talks about how the ""Gods envy us because we are mortal"" was quite good.Although the Gods did not play a real vital part in the movie as they did in the Iliad, I guess some liberties were taken to make it more palatable to today's audience.I really like Eric Bana's (Hector) acting in this film. As the son of Priam, he nobly defends Troy and you even find yourself feeling sympathetic towards him. Realizing his impending death, he gives his wife who is holding their newborn, instructions for hiding from the Greek army just before he goes into battle with Achilles outside the walls of Troy. You feeling sorry for Hector, as an infuriated Achilles seeks to avenge the death of Patrocolus who Hector has slayed.I thought that Orlando Bloom (Paris) acting seemed sub par. I was also expecting Helen to have more scenes and be more central to the movie.The battle scenes were very cinematic, and the showdown between Hector and Achilles may have been the best scene in the movie.This was a great epic film. I would also recommend The Gladiator.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Helen fails to convince that men would go mad for her beauty. The 10 year war is condensed into a few weeks, and towards the end of the film increasing liberties are taken with Homer's history. It would nice to have mentioned that the few escapees from Troy go on to found Rome which will one day conquer Greece.",7.0,Anonymous,History
I think there might have been some glue on the screen...,"When I first heard they were making a film based on Homer's The Illiad about a year ago, I was delighted, and as a lover of films and this book my hype was surely too much. As the date drew nearer, my excitement grew, I thought it was going to be the best film ever. Did I overestimate it?The Illiad is the only book I have ever read, I've attempted to read more books but I just can't sit down and read. I find it boring. But with the Illiad, it was the opposite. A truly great story which you can just sit there and read and let your imagination take control. But now, Wolfgang Peterson has brought this epic tale to life. If you take a look at the end credits, it will say, Inspired by Homer's The Illiad. You have to take this into account because you cannot expect any film to stay true to a book like The Illiad in every aspect, you see, I believe that the 'Inspired by' sets it apart from book-film adaptations such as Lord of the Rings, as this film is called Troy, and not The Illiad. Many people want this film to fail because they believe it shouldn't have been made and will be an insult to The Illiad and others who want it to fail because of its $200million dollar budget. As for the director of Troy, Wolfgang Peterson, I can say that I am not familiar with much of his work, apart from Air Force One, which I quite enjoyed. But despite his critics, we know he can create something special as he did with his powerful war/drama Das Boot (Which I haven't seen but being in the IMDB's top 250 at number 45 says alot.)When I heard the casting of Troy, I was quite suprised to see so many big names in one film, many people questioned the casting of Brad Pitt as Achilles and at first, so did I. I've always pictured Achilles in the physique of Brad Pitt, but I didn't think he could do it. I read that he put on an English accent for the film and I went in expecting a weak performance from him. At the beginning of the film I still was a little weary of him, but as the film went on, I became quite impressed with his performance. What could you expect? Achilles was very arrogant, egotistical, and a great warrior, and this was indeed how Pitt portrayed him, with a loving side to him, towards Patroclus. If anyone doubts him, they should look at him without all his star-glow and just accept that he IS Achilles and truly does give a great performance. Oscar worthy? I wouldn't think so but honestly, he should be worthy of at least a nomination. As for my favourite character in the book, Hector, was played very well by Eric Bana (The Hulk.) with clearly one of the better performances throughout the film, now, in my opinion, The Hulk was a bad film, but you cannot blame that on Bana, because he wasn't in it enough, the screen was taken up mostly by a big green thing which didn't seem to fit into his surroundings at all. But, in Troy, when Bana was on screen, I was taken by his performance and not thinking, 'When's this guy gonna turn into The Hulk?' Oscar worthy? Hope So. As for the casting of his younger brother, the cowardly, ladies man, Paris, I think Orlando Bloom was perfect for this role. Because, lets face it, the ladies love him and he is the 'big' thing at the moment. After starring in the Lord of the Rings, as a fearless Elvish hero, and being sidelined by an amzing Depp in Pirates of the Carribean as a fearless 'pirate' hero, it came as a nice change to see him play a coward, a character who loves ladies, and ladies love him back. I think he did the job very well but most of the time he was on screen, it was already taken by Bana or O'Toole (King Priam). Oscar Worthy? Not really, his character is too limited but still a great performance. Sean Bean was another good casting as Odysseus whos previous best effort came as the cold hearted human, Borimir in the Lord of the Rings. But, let us not forget the great performances by Peter O'Toole and Brian Cox (Priam and Agamemnon respectively.) As for the film, I think it was very well done and the battle scenes were nothing short of amazing, not one acotr stood out as a poor performance and the script too, hardly seemed to have any flaws. Its exactly how I imagined it. The scenes which stuck out to me were, when we first see Achilles laying amongst two other women and then half-heartetly getting up and going to the battle for a one-on-one which lasted mear seconds, the thousands of ships crossing the sea, the arrival of Achilles on the beach, the storming of the greek camp at day break, the fight between Hector and Achilles as Hector's whole family watched on, and the final scene with the Trojan Horse. In fact, the whole film stood out to me. Especially when Achilles talks to his mother who tells him that going to war will be his ticket to immortality. You know when I film of this length, 160 minutes, is good when you don't get a sore rear sitting down for this long, and you don't look at your watch once or have to think, 'When is this going to end?'As for the final questions... Is this film worth $200million dollars? Yes. Is it enjoyable from start to finish? Yes. Did I overrate this film going into it thinking it would be the greatest film I ever did see? No. This is a masterpiece and should be up there with the best of them. I know this film has had mixed reviews but who cares? I don't. Critics gave Lost In Translation a great review and it was pretty bad and rather boring, and thats just one example. I could give you many more, I know its opinion, but I honestly can't see what they saw in that movie and haven't seen in this one. And anyone out there, if you are looking to see something extemely entertaining, with a great story (Perhaps the greatest) and some good acting, Don't go and see Van Helsing, this is the movie you want to see. If Homer (If he really did exist as one man) was able to see this movie, he should be honoured that his story was brought to life with such grace. Peterson did a great job and deserves nothing but positive reviews anything other should merely be cast aside with the reviews for Lost In Translation.Best acted part: Eric Bana.Best scene: 'Immortality, take it, its yours!' Achilles and his men then storm the beach and the temple, destroying everyone in their path and then his first meeting with Hector outside the Temple, 'It's too early to kill Princes.'.Oscar Worthy?: Yes! It better be. It's still early in the year mind you, but I have a feeling it will be overlooked.Verdict: I'm sure there was some sort of glue on the screen which simply stuck my eyes to it... 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Troy is the best,The characters were awesome. Brad Pitt did a fine job and he was really hot in the movie. The Helen character was good. Hector was really good and all the fight scenes where the best. Troy was the best movie in 2004. Orlando Bloom was kind playing a fool and I did not like him so much but all in all it was still great. There was some things I found wrong that I think the history could have been more suitable and that is where Achilles and Chryseis where together and where Patroclus were his cousin that just wasn't true. Orlando Bloom kind started to confuse me. Another thing that bothered me was the fact that Menelaus was not killed by Hector and Aegememnon not by Chryseis. Menelaus did not die but returned home with Helen and that Aegememnon was murdered by his own wife and a suitor.it was still a very good movie and it inspired me a lot.,10.0,Anonymous,History
Impressive set piece drama,The sets and action are very impressive in this movie. It makes it enjoyable and fun to watch. I would say however it does have some weaker scenes in the movie when there are close scenes between characters.

Troy or Tripe?,"Troy or Tripe? On a score of 1-10 I'd give it a 3, just for the fight scene between Hector and Achilles. Horrible movie. Highly disappointing. The casting, the script, the dialog - all were mediocre and BORING. I agree with Roger Ebert - if Homer was alive he'd sue. How can you alter such a Classic story? Did anyone do any actual research, or did they just read Cliffs Notes on the Iliad? This type of movie is catered to the SAMs (Stupid Audience Members). I am angry thinking about what might have been...The made-for-TV mini series ""Helen of Troy"" was better, though there were some changes here as well.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Could have been a better movie,"This film was not bad, but could have been much better. 1. It needed a stronger lead actor, Brad Pitt is pretty, but his performance fell way short! An audience will forgive almost anything if the lead is a strong actor. Bravo to Peter O'Toole! A supporting actor nomination for sure! 2. I feel the film didn't build up Helen's character enough. After all, she was the supposed reason for everything in the first place. They touch on it in the beginning but it would have been interesting to see how she got involved in the first place. 3. Costumes were sometimes terrible, not very convincing, I hated those blue lounging robes! They looked like something for Return of the Jedi! 4. Some of the dialog was weak, too modern for an ancient setting. 5. The second half of the movie was better than the first half. I finally started feeling some emotion. I give this film 2 stars.",,Anonymous,History
Kinda boring for an epic . . .,"This ""swords and sandals"" outing is to be praised for its special effects and overall visual appeal.It seems to pay reverent homage to ""The Iliad"" but truth be told, if the characters in ""The Iliad"" were so one-dimensional and wooden I doubt we'd still be thinking about them today. Yes, that's a sideways poke at early dialog from the movie for those of you keeping score at home. I know because I saw that scene three times before I finally got through the whole movie without falling asleep.There are no stand-out performances that I could see but all were adequate. There is eye-candy for both sexes but mostly for the ladies that don't mind the violence; was that the audience they had in mind here?It was nice to see the Troy legend (?) without any over-the-top god(s) sequences to spoil the human narrative. Myth or truth; this story still has an obvious connection to the human condition of our modern age.",7.0,Anonymous,History
There Love Sank A Civilization,"The epic story of the siege of Troy, one of the oldest tales of the civilized world, was the basis for a return of the big budget sand and sandal epics of the Fifties and Sixties as the big studios were spending tons of money on films to make them bigger and better to compete with television. It's as spectacular as anything that Cecil B. DeMille did without the 19th century Victorian prose that his scripts were laced with. In fact it's better because DeMille did not have computer graphics available to him.One of the criticisms I hear about the film was that it was not comprehensive enough in terms of telling the whole story. To tell this whole story would require a lengthy mini-series and this was made for the big screen. If a two hour and 40 minute version of the story constitutes a Reader's Digest version of same, than so be it. The basic parts were covered and the errors are purely in the interest of editing.Brendon Gleeson is King Meneleus of Sparta and he has a lovely young trophy queen named Helen played by Diane Kruger. Paris the son of King Priam of Troy is on a diplomatic mission from his city state which is across the Aegean Sea and in what is now Turkey. Orlando Bloom as Paris who is a rather shallow and callow youth, takes one look at Helen and she him and the chemistry gets going. He sneaks her aboard the Trojan ship before word is out and she's in Troy before you can say cuckolded.Of course Meneleus ain't taking this lying down and he gets together with the rulers of the other Greek city states and they put together a D-Day like invasion and the siege begins. Although you wouldn't know it from the film, it lasts 10 years and that's really the only fault of the film. But again it's in the interest of editing.A lot of the success of the invasion depends on the legendary Greek warrior Achilles and his elite guard called the Myrmidons. Achilles is played by a bulked up Brad Pitt and it's one of his best performances. Although my favorite role of Pitt's is in Seven Years In Tibet, this one is cited by his many fans in saying that Brad's come of age as an actor and not just a pretty face.The climax is the famous fight between Orlando Bloom's brother, Prince Hector of Troy and Achilles. Hector slew young Patroclus played by Garrett Hedlund who was in Achilles armor and Achilles is out for blood. It's a no quarter match when Achilles slays Hector and with it a lot of the hopes and dreams of Troy. Hector is played well by Eric BanaMy favorite scene is when King Priam goes out on the field to claim Hector's body and meets Achilles. Priam is played by Peter O'Toole and I'm surprised O'Toole did not get yet another Oscar nomination for Priam in the Supporting Actor category. Achilles the disillusioned warrior because he sees the greed and rapaciousness of the Greek kings and Priam the heartbroken but still proud ruler of Troy who has to see his duty through meet and gain a mutual respect for the other. This scene between Pitt and O'Toole is the best in the film by far.Reading the ancient text by Homer, the Greek Gods play significant parts in the drama. Here they are acknowledged, but make no presence in the film. It's a most secular story indeed and is criticized by some for that reason, but I find no fault with it.The best reason to see Troy is to awaken an appreciation of the classics, especially among the young. If this Reader's Digest version of Homer's epic, inspires someone to do just that, it will be well worth the budget.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The Trojan War against all Wars,"The true revelation of ""Troy"" is David Benioff, the author of a tough, demystifying screenplay, which is also able to give coherence to a scattered, contradictory mythical tradition. Benioff eliminates the gods, lifeless ghosts of an ancestral religion, who already in Homer appeared to be only vain, even ridiculous puppets. Achilles cuts the head of Apollon off, but on the other hand Hector openly contests the useless superstitions of some grotesque Trojan priests. But the main target of Benioff's polemic script is the thirst for power of Agamemnon and Menelaus, the Homeric ""hateful sons of Atreus""; the Trojan war itself is condemned as a prototype of every ancient (or modern) imperialistic war. But if the movie blames the war, by presenting it as a dreadful myth of the past (but, unfortunately, of the present too), on the contrary it shows a deep respect towards Homer and his poetry. Entire sequences of the Iliad are carefully translated into images of flawless visual suggestion. If one knows the Iliad well, it is easy for him to identify keen references to single verses of the Homeric masterpiece: the Achaean ""phalanx"" which tightens itself, ""man close to man, shield close to shield""; Achilles who ""puts his hands on the chest of"" the dead Patroclus, and stays awake near his friend's pyre for a whole night; the impeccable representation of the Greek camp, of the ships and of the tents. The so often criticized 'alterations' of the Homeric text represent a discussion of the myth, not of Homer's poetry. As a matter of fact, the most significant changes do not concern Homer, but the final part of the Trojan saga, which was originally narrated by some modest rhapsodic poets trying to imitate the great Homer. It is worthwhile to indicate that the final of Troy, with its precocious sentimental implications, is inspired to the Medieval tradition, especially to Benoit de Sainte Maure's ""Roman de Troie""(very well known also to Dante), while the movie gives less importance to the incoherent, disordered tales of the late Epic tradition. Some more words about the acting. Brad Pitt is incredibly able to identify himself with the melancholic (although lethal)Achilles; but also Eric Bana is convincing in his interpretation of Hector, and Orlando Bloom manages well the anti-heroic character for excellence, that is to say Paris. Only the women are a disappointment, excepting Julie Christie and Rose Byrne/Briseis.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Legends of the Fall Part 2,"Well, this movie had a lot of hype, and in some ways really delivered. The battle scenes were well done and exciting. There wasn't too much fast moving camera so you could at least follow the fight scenes a bit. The overall feel of the movie was enjoyable and the movie did what it set out to do. It made you love the characters they want you to love, feel sorry for the appropriate ones and hate others. All well directed.For the most part the cast was excellent. Eric Bana and Brian Cox really steal the show as Hector and Agamamnon respectively. Brendan Gleeson was also superb as Menelaus. Orlando Bloom, Diane Kruger, Garrett Hedlund, and Peter O'Toole put up respectable performances. Another borderline scene stealer was Sean Bean as Odysseus. Brad Pitt however was utterly unpleasant. While I'm sure some ladies liked how he looked, he was the only misfit in the movie and was totally out of place in his role. Unfortunately this really wasn't so much a movie about Troy as it was about Achilles, which meant a lot of unpleasant scenes with an actor who wasn't holding his own. This alone almost ruined the movie, but the shoulders of Bana, Gleeson, Cox, and Bean were able to make this a movie worth watching.Now, while this doesn't detract directly from the movie, it isn't a very exact representation of the Illiad. People die at the wrong times, the wrong people live, and basically it's simply a movie inspired by the Illiad. I won't go into specifics as I don't want to spoil the movie for those who haven't viewed it, but be prepared that this isn't the Illiad by Homer.Overall, if you're interested, you should see it. You won't regret viewing it, but I doubt it'll be on too many people's top ten lists. It certainly could have been with a better actor for Achilles and following Homer's thoughts a little closer.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Best War Film Ever!!!!,"This movie is by far the most impressive war film to date. Yes, that's right, it deserves to be better than Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, and Gladiator as well. Brian Cox is absolutely ferocious as Agamemnon and Brad Pitt is as good as he gets playing Achilles. Eric Bana brings amazing honor and devotion to the role of Hector, especially when he delivers the movie's best line, ""Honor the Gods, Love your women, and Defend your country!"" This spectacular production offers battle sequences UNLIKE ANY OTHER, both epic-scale and man-to-man. An amazing retelling of Homer's ""The Illiad."" Thankfully, Orlando Bloom is there to bring his stupidity and selfishness to the role of the callow Trojan Prince Paris.

Spectacular battle scenes dwarf the human drama...Brad Pitt miscast...,"The biggest flaw in TROY is that BRAD PITT, while looking more buff than ever and obviously having trained for the battle scenes with a personal trainer, is a disappointment as Achilles. He pouts his way through the entire role like a petulant child rather than a mature man who wants his name to down in history as a great warrior.When pitted against an acting giant like PETER O'TOOLE his lack of charisma in the role shows badly. Furthermore, he's simply miscast. The film needed someone who could give gravitas to the role. In old Hollywood, it's the sort of part that would have been ideal for someone like GARY COOPER.Everyone else fares a lot better. ERIC BANA, PETER O'TOOLE and SEAN BEAN are excellent, while ORLANDO BLOOM struggles to make the role of Paris come alive. He's at a disadvantage every time he shares a scene with his brother, ERIC BANA, as Hector. Bana gives the kind of intense performance that Brad Pitt never achieves. Nor does DIANE KRUGER bring more than a beautiful face to the role of Helen of Troy.But the film itself is glorious to watch. There's spectacle galore for each huge battle scene and some of the human conflicts are well staged, although most of them seem dwarfed by all the lavish sets and costumes. There's stunning realism to all the battle scenes but the highlight is the way Bana and Pitt fight a duel to the death.James Horner has composed a marvelous score, full of exotic color and adding a lot of texture to the overall drama.The cinematography is gorgeous, especially all of the outdoor shots showing the vast landscape populated by a vast army (thanks to CGI) and the fleet of Trojan ships nearing shore.Summing up: Enjoyable view of ancient times, but purists will object to all the changes made in ""The Illiad"" on which it's loosely based. Fans of action films will get their money's worth.",7.0,Anonymous,History

A Song of Pitt and Bana.,"I suggest fans of A Game of Thrones rewatch this film, as I'm almost certain they will appreciate it all the more.Written by David Benioff, the man responsible for bringing the SOIAF series to HBO, Troy shares a number of resemblances to the acclaimed stories. What both tales do so well is create ambiguous characters, blurring the hero/villain dichotomy. Achilles (Pitt) is a bit of a prat, and Paris(Bloom)is a fool, leaving Hector (Bana) the 'hero' if one must be assigned.The film is a blockbuster at the end of the day, and the acting is of variable quality, but this adaptation is a strong depiction of the honour and respect of Ancient Greek warfare- if not particularly faithful to its mythology. Going beyond the brief appearances of Ned Stark (Sean Bean) and Maester Pycelle (Julian Glover), Benioff's two productions converge with the multiple deaths of main characters, and the conflicted emotions felt by the audience. Without elaborating, players on both sides meet their end, and we are not necessarily aligned to wish death upon either party.Focusing on the humanity and personality of individual soldiers creates a powerful emotional connection to both warring parties; a complex narrative achievement perhaps all too often taken for granted.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Something good to watch.,"This is a great movie overall, although the beginning was a little slow for me. It took me a great deal of patience to leave it on, because of the slow beginning, but I'm very glad I did due to it really picking up. I don't have any major complaints with the acting. I believe all the parts were very well casted, although nothing spectacular. This movie will stick in your mind for a little bit, although it is not something that will stay in your mind forever. The plot was not very complex, but solid without many loose ends. The action is what made the movie, the plot helped, but overall the war scenes are what made this movie.

Lets make epic stories not so epic,"An apparent trend in the year 2004 was to demystify popular stories and make them more down to earth. This ended up working pretty well in King Arthur, which claimed to use historical accuracy and fact as a storysetter, but as far as Troy goes, the end result was quite disappointing.If you are unfamiliar with the Iliad, there is interaction between the gods as well as mortals. Everyone and everything is incorporated into this massive battle for power and glory, but started by love. There are heroes on both sides of the battle, and the reader is meant to cheer for both sides and witness the pain and destruction of dramatic battle.However...Wolfgang Peterson decided not to incorporate the gods at all into the story, instead focusing on the human characters. Not that they aren't interesting or anything, but the story has so much more to offer. Getting rid of the gods and their endless drama with each other really downsized the scope of the situation. To put it in perspective, lets say they tried to do the same thing with Lord of the Rings. The movie would be more to the tune of ""yeah there's like 12 orcs coming over here. Maybe we should shoot them or something."" Meanwhile, the ringwraiths would really be the brazillian soccer team in disguise and the rohirrim would slide down the hill in their rocking horses. Oh yeah, and the whole Trojan war deal was shortened from 10 years to a couple days.The whole tone of the story just seemed downplayed. Odysseus said little of his homeland of Ithaca, Ajax played about as important of a part as an eating utensil, and there was no urgency or indecisiveness about Achilles' situation. They mention his little prophecy, which is kind of an important deal, once, and really don't come back to it at all. It should have been one of the main themes of the story. And remember how there should be like 2000 Myrmidans? You know, like the best warriors in the world that turn the tide of the battle? There's like 40 of them. And the greeks most desperate hour, when they must resort to building a wall out of their now unneeded ships to shield them from the Trojans, is nonexistent in this particular motion feature event.Besides for restraining the grandeur of the original story, the movie itself stands on its own I guess. The sets are nice, the acting was good for the most part (except for a horribly miscast Brad Pitt as the brooding and effectively emo Achilles). Orlando Bloom is perfectly wimpy and stupid, and Eric Bana is genuinely heroic and the all around good guy as Troy's Hector. And there were some nicely choreographed sword fights. The script lacked a little but there weren't any lines that immediately struck me as just godawful.If you're just interesting in a swords and sandal epic, then watch this and you shouldn't be disappointed. Don't expect a Gladiator. If you're expecting Homer's Iliad at its greatest splendor and epicity (is that a word? it is now...), then watch something else. Just recreate the battle with dinosaurs on your bedroom floor. It'd be more spectacular.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Fangirls, cheer for joy.

However, I'm sure I wasn't the only one that noticed (my friend did also), his accent couldn't decide if it was English or American.  By the end of the film I gave up trying to figure it out (luckily Achilles DIES before the end of the film) because I was begging myself to just get up and leave.However, credit must go to Eric Bana for his role.  Perhaps the only redeeming quality of this tragedy (pun intended).So, yes, fangirls -- you'll get your share of bare bottoms.  Probably the only hope this film has of being a success.

Will the real Wolfgang Peterson please stand up?,"Even though I am fervent admirer of Wolfgang Peterson's TV film in German ""Black and white like day and night"" made in 1978, his later films including his ""Das Boot"" and ""In the line of fire"" and ""Troy"" lack the ingredients of superior cinema. In the 1978 film Peterson came up with a brilliant performance from Bruno Ganz that will be etched in the memory of any film-goer, backed up by brilliant indoor shots.If someone thinks Troy is a great effort, they ought to compare the 1956 ""Helen of Troy"" (directed by Robert Wise) where the late Stanley Baker's Achilles was powerful though not having any penchant for reflection. Baker's Achilles was all brawn. Pitt's Achilles had the brooding hero shifting from the philosophical to the flippant, never letting the character develop to evoke sympathy for his fate, a character who knows his future actions (that he has to kill Hector in only in public and thus gain eternal fame). Pitt's and Peterson's Achilles taunts the gods and kings but is silenced by a woman. Peterson had a great opportunity to develop the contradictions in the character, but chose instead to truncate the useful scene with his mother (Julie Christieshe is good even in such brief appearances) that could have been developed further.I have read that Peter O'Toole did not appreciate Peterson's inputsyet O'Toole is the saving grace of the film (a film where Paris kills Achilles by shooting arrows at his chest rather than his Achilles tendon!). So was Nigel Terry whose stage voice stood out in stark contrast to the other actors. For me, O'Toole, Christie and Terry were the saving graces in an unremarkable filmunless you judge a film solely for its stunts and special effects.Peterson did make a great decision to enhance the appeal of the film by employing the singing talents of Tanja Tzarovska. But why did Peterson and screen-playwright David Benioff tamper with Homer's work to make Achilles one of the Greeks who entered Troy in the belly of the horse? That's totally out of character. Achilles was not a man who would adopt such tactics. In the original epic, Achilles dies outside the ramparts of Troy by an arrow shot at his heel.Even though most of his recent films have been lack-luster, I believe the Peterson who made ""Black and white like day and night"" is a talented director. I wish the real Peterson will stand up in the future and not be swayed by big budgets and studio pressures and deliver decent cinema as he used to decades ago.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Because Brad Pitt sucked, he could have given it more, he just memorized the lines and spit them out one after another, the acting level was basic, not much emotion and not enough in the right areas.EX> Achilles receives news from his Goddess mother that if he goes he will die and be remember forever, Brad Pitt crinkles his eyes and looks away from the camera and just stands there unbelievably terrible.Also there was insecurity in gesture and timing.Ex: Achilles giving his henchman the speech at the end, Achilles say,"" Take it, its yours"" The hand-word ratio was off and it looked weak, of and CGI use was overpowering.I was however happy with Orlando Bloom who I usually don't like, because he played down his powerful character of Legolas of the Lord of the Rings to play the sissy punk Paris who knew nothing of real life and thought love was everything, very good Bloom.Oh and I'm sorry but the choice for Helen of Troy was terrible, she wasn't even that pretty, what that actress was was CUTE, not HOT, Carmen Electra would've been great, even though her acting skills aren't that good, her face is beautiful.Oh and Pitt needs to learn how to be a bad guy, your not supposed to look cute, the acting bad part MAKES you look cute. It seemed Brad was just trying to hit good angles and catch some of that hair in his eyes and look luscious and it was making his character look weak.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Troy,"Best film I have seen in a long time. But one thing i noticed about the written film lines.Odysseus:If they ever tell my story let them say that I walked with giants. Men rise and fall like the winter wheat, but these names will never die. Let them say I lived in the time of Hector, tamer of horses. Let them say I lived in the time of Achilles.Tamer of horses? I think you will find it's tamer of Forces.Brad Pitt plays this part with sheer excellence, the entire film is truly awesome.

Shell of a tale....,"Well Homer it's not. There is no way you can make a movie and not cut 80% of Homer tale. If you didn't the movie would be days long. But you don't have to change things around to make it shorter. This movie makes the war weeks (or less) long where it took 10 years, with all kinds of twists. Achilles doesn't ride in the horse (but I guess you can't kill Pitt off before the end). No reference to Odessus's 10 years to get home (yes it's another story, but a reference was expected). Cutting the gods completely out of the story was OK, yet I liked the story where they are involved. They could have shown Achilles being dipped in the river Styx except for his heal to explain his dying. But I'll take a ""This is how it really happened"" take on the movie. It works OK.As for an action movie it's OK. I'm really getting sick of scenes that you know are CGI just because there is too much stuff (e.g. 1000 ships). The battle scenes are pretty good. It's no Gladiator though.The acting was all over the place. This is Pitt's worst yet. I think this is due more to the director than to Pitt himself (e.g. See 12 Monkeys). Eric Bana does a great Hector and Bloom turns in a pretty wimpy Paris. Peter O'Toole seemed he like should retire. He walked through the movie like he wanted to be somewhere else. Although I never would have guessed I'd see a movie with a Brad Pitt and Peter O'Toole scene.On the whole it was a fun watch. 6/10 (+6 for the action -4 for Pitts acting).

Very nice adaptation of the Iliad by Homer,"The Helen of Troy story is still great after 2500 years. Wolfgang Petersen does not disappoint and mixes mythology, myth and legend very nicely. Brad Pitt does a nice job as Achilles. Physically he is a good fit for the near-god. Brian Cox as the imperious Agamemnon is perfect. It is good to see him in more expanding roles. The battle scenes were well put together and believable. The special effects were well done but not overwhelming though it is hard not to do when a flotilla is called for and a cast of thousands; remember, Helen had a face that launched a thousand ships. Overall, a nice film and one to add to the DVD collection. It is too bad it went in and out of theatres too fast to give it justice.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Troy  - finally something for women,"Finally, porn for women. Amidst the the art directors' carefree attitude towards history, the unfortunate script writing, and the fact that we're numb to the special effects used in epic films these days, this was a great movie to watch over a glass of wine! Gals, we've been waiting for this. Men in little leathery skirts with hemlines that barely reach the outward curve of their thighs - and these guys keep falling down, legs akimbo. I have not seen so many tanned and taught legs since the time I sneaked into the gay dance party one summer long ago. I have now stolen Brad Pitt's hairdo, and looking frantically about for those wonderful little golden hair accessories the princes of Troy were so fond of. Anyway, all joking aside, it's an action movie people! It wasn't all that bad, just not what one would hope. But what it did turn out to be was a visual feast for the eyes with men who speak in complete sentences, look great even with blood on them, and remind us of the time we gals ogled the hunter gatherers. Besides, there are so many gorgeous and talented actors in one place - Brad Pitt, Sean Bean, Orlando Bloom, Eric Bana, Vincent Regan, et al. One for every weeknight after a long day's work. So, if you want to be reminded how smart you are, see a documentary. If you're alone on a Friday night, rent this movie.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Please read the Iliad!,"OK, I can skip the-striking nonetheless-absence of gods.Let's just accept that the director had a more ""human""v version in mind. But the most well known war of mankind just couldn't have lasted 2 weeks! Mercy, please! According to the Iliad-which along with the Odyssey have been for thousands of years the bedtime story as well as an essential part of every Greek child's education,so please excuse my anger-it lasted 10 years. Of course the epic covers a period of some days,as far as action is concerned,but couldn't the film have started in a more explanatory way rather than this completely fictional and ridiculous battle?For instance there could have been the dramatic sacrifice of Ifigenia, Agamemnon's daughter, ata the port of Avlida, so that the wind would blow and allow the Greek ships to leave.Personalities who have inspired the greatest Greek tragedies such as Klitemnistra,Agamemnon's wife who along with her lover killed Agamemnon on his return to Greece,not being able to forgive him the sacrifice of her child, and Electra and Orestes,their other two kids-the former killed his mother and her lover to avenge his father's death-are nowhere in the film. Just for your information, Achilles was no cold-blooded warrior,he was also a king and his Mirmidons were his army, not a bunch of stupid warriors. Another point where I was on the verge of breaking the screen was that of Achilles's death.The man died before the Greeks entered Troy, which is why the Greeks resorted to the solution of the Trojan horse. And of course he didn't fall in love with the slave,because no Greek man gave a damn about women,especially a foreigner and especially in times of war.Achilles was in love only with himself and glory.Paris did kill him- but he was killed immediately after-by hitting his only mortal part,his left heel. Menalaus went back home WITH Helen-we meet them later in the Odyssey. Another detail that could have added emotion to the film but was not seen,was the moment when Laokoon, a Trojan priest of Apollo, warned the king Priam ""fear the Greeks when they offer gifts"" when the latter decided to accept the horse.That very moment two large snakes came from the sea and drowned him and his two sons-sent from Poseidon,the god of the sea who was on the side of the Greeks. There are countless details and many important things that have been left out or distorted-such as the apple of Discord and the three godesses Athena, Venus and Hera who claimed it ,with Venus winning it by promising Paris the most beautiful woman on earth, or the numerous Greek kings that are seen nowhere in the film though thoroughly described in the epic poem. All in all, I must say I can't be objective on commenting on the film ,as for anyone who has seen it after having read Homer's masterpiece it is a complete disappointment.",,Anonymous,History
Entertaining Film,"Viewed older versions of stories dealing with the Greeks and the Trojan Nation and of course, the Trojan Horse. There were different versions with Archilles and how his wounded heel brought his life to a crashing end and in this picture it is quickly done without you even noticing it.This film gave a completely different outlook on the picture with great scenes of battles and how balls of fire went crashing to the Greek encampment near the sea along with a great cast of actors. Thought that Archilles, (Brad Pitt) and Helen of Troy, (Diane Kruger) both gave outstanding performances. Whenever Hollywood makes a film about History, you can always count on the facts to be distorted and completely cut out of a film: I would not be too critical of a picture like this because it is not a documentary film which gives accurate details. I found this film to be great compared to the older films depicting the story of Troy.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Very impressed,"A superb movie all around...I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. It seems most of the bad reviews on this film are coming from those who either wanted it to be 100% ""historically accurate"", or people who seem to just despise Brad Pitt for some reason (jealousy?). Either way, I myself am not a big Pitt fan, although I was pleasantly surprised to see he pulled off the role of Achilles much better than I had expected. Arrogant, cocky, yet at times sulky and emotional...he hit it imo. As for not sticking totally to 'The Iliad', well, I don't know if I could sit through an 8 hour movie because that's what it would take basically. Sure, Agememnon and Menelaus did not die at Troy, but in this case it made the movie better, which is more important to me. The fact is, most of the major events, battles, and characters were depicted accurately...much closer than say, Gladiator for instance. Paris and Hector in Sparta, Helen to Troy, the battles, Hector killing Petriclus, Achilles rage and then killing Hector, dragging his body in front of the walls of Troy, Priam going to Achilles' tent, etc, etc...bottom line is the main points were covered and I expect a certain amount of stray from the story to begin with. Sticking to Homer's version 100% would have made the movie longer and maybe even boring at times (we do not even know how accurate 'The Iliad' is to begin with!). I went to see this movie hoping for an epic spectacle with a fair amount of historical accuracy and not for The Iliad on screen. I got exactly what I wanted and much, much more.",10.0,Anonymous,History
No theme?,"If I were given the chance to change a single thing in this movie it would be firing James Horner. As if his reputation had no base. Where is the unwritten rule of all great movie scores, especially the ones from movies of such magnitude - you gotta have a theme brother. Where's the theme in ""Troy"", where's the feeling that something either epic and heroic or evil and malicious is happening on the screen. All we are treated with are female vocals that sound strangely familiar-oh wait, could it be similar to the great score from ""Gladiator"". ""Troy"" doesn't hide similarities with the latter, sadly they only make it look cheaper and without its own soul, but still, if they copied elements why not copy them right. In this aspect ""Troy"" is very much inferior to Scott's Oscar winner, it lacks in the actor's performances(only the two kings show the stuff that great actors are made of-kudos to Peter O'Toole and especially especially to Brian Cox who singlehandedly made every other actor in his scenes look like a good one, decent at the least), visual effects, cinematography, the works. It has nothing going for it that will satisfy a movie freak like me. Sure, those 3 hours went by pretty quickly, and Orlando Bloom even showed some hints of acting in him(the boy is truly awful in his scenes with Helena), Brad Pitt managed to make his hair color look authentic for a while, and Eric Bana didn't sound and feel like a Russel Crowe imitator all of the time, but the feeling that ""Troy"" could have been one of the better movies of 2004 remains-sadly! Need I start mentioning the book this movie is based on. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,History
Only one word for this film: Amazing,"I went to see this film mainly because of Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean (I love watching movies with LOTR actors/actresses in them), and also because I've developed an interest for war films all of a sudden, ever since I saw LOTR:ROTK.First of all, the acting: Everybody did a wonderful job (special mention to Eric Bana and Sean Bean). Yes, Brad Pitt's accent was a little weird at times, but it wasn't as bad as many claim it to be. Orlando Bloom did Paris very well too.Next is the CGI: Excellent. Nuff' said. :)Battle scenes: Strangely enough, my favorite battle scene is when Menelaus (sp?) beats up Paris. Wow, that was just... cool. I felt really sad for the prince, and I just wanted to hug him right then and there. BTW, Hector VS Achilles also had me at the edge of my seat.Nudity, violence, etc. : In the Philippines, it was rated PG-13 (Haha! jk), thankfully. There are about... three scenes which show *ahem* sexual stuff, all with Achilles in them :P. One scene shows Helen naked,  too. As for the violence, Gladiator was more violent for me. Patroclus' throat getting slit made me wince, and one scene where Achilles cuts the  head off of some guy was so fast I didn't even get the chance to cover my eyes (yes, I'm a coward). I understand why It's rated R in other places, but for me, PG-13 was just fine.Comedy: There *was* comedy in the film, though not much. Agamemnon served as the comic relief often.Other stuff: Whoo, Paris gets a bow and arrows sometime in the movie! Near the end he starts shooting his enemies down without being noticed. I know the whole theatre was thinking ""woah, he turned into Legolas all of a sudden"". I know, I couldn't help but think that.All in all, the film was fun, exciting, and did not contain one boring moment at all. I loved it. :) And I'm gonna see it again!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Giganto-fetish clouds some of the more personal aspects of splendidly captured war,"Epic, mega-budget release directed by the respected Wolfgang Peterson effectively conveys all of the visual splendor and passion the infamous battle of Troy would have entailed. While the production values definitively register as top of the line, the movie almost seems obsessed with it's own grandeur to a fault. Peterson offers some of modern cinema's most spectacularly photographed battle scenes with the unreal flyovers and other various techniques used when creating the thousands of soldiers do battle, but somehow manages to drown out the amazing characters covered in this material taken from The Iliad. Surprisingly the much criticized Brad Pitt in the role of the worlds greatest warrior, Achilles, holds well, with his darkly sensual performance overriding any believability coming from such a small frame and pretty face. Other main characters also blend in well with the roles they were cast in, even the usually laughable Orlando Bloom had the perfect lover-boy/wuss role at his disposal so as to not completely shatter the involvement of the viewer trying to take this questionable cast seriously. Overall, Troy was an awesome sight to behold that lives up to the historical weight thrust upon this battle, although not without compromising some of the more character driven material in favor of wide-eyed, though repetitious battle scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Loved it,"I am reading Homer's Iliad these days and thought watching the movie will help me visualize the story. I actually lost track of time and had a good amount of adrenaline released in my circulation.I think, criticizing the movie as too Hollywoodish doesn't make sense too me. If you're interested in more historical facts and less flamboyancy, well there are many documentaries about it. After all it is very likely that Homer's Iliad is a cluster of changed and exaggerated pieces of true history (if any) over half a millennium of oral poetry.Ohh by the way,in my opinion Eric Bana's performance in this movie is far better than Brad Pitt or Orlando Bloom's.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Great piece of art,"This definitely one to see. Even if it doesn't tell the history piece by piece, the special effects are to be seen. Troy's battle scenes are awesome and will leave your jaw wide open. It is not a movie to see if you don't like action and romance films. Brad Pitt really did a great job as Achiles, his acting was one of the best I have seen him do, he really must of have been training for month to get that control of the sword and that ""great"" body. This movie might not be as pleasant to you if you don't like a 90% action movie and 10% drama movie.

"Good film, pity about some casting.","I went to watch this film with great anticipation as i had loved ""Gladiator"" It did not disappoint. I have never read Homers' Illiad so i had nothing to go on.The film was shot beautifully and contrary to other opinions the script was fantastic, it really made the characters bear their feelings and souls, something which is often lost in action epics.Mainly the cast was fantastic. Brian Cox was a brilliant villain and the fiery exchanges between him and Achilles were entertaining. Eric Bana was by far the best actor in the film, and has probably undone the damage made to his career by ""The Hulk"".Not all performances were great, Orlando Bloom was positively wooden but Paris was not a very interesting or likable character.

"""Troy"" - The Honest Soul of the Iliad on Film","Given some cynical reviews based, I think on a lack of knowledge on the subject matter, I had avoided the current 2004 epic movie ""Troy"". But I bought it the other day for only ten dollars in a bargain bin - 2 disc deluxe DVD widescreen edition even. And after viewing the film I can only say it retains the soul of Homer's ""The Iliad"", that fantastic bard of Greek poetry that describes the tragedy of the senseless war between Trojans and Greeks, with the tale of Achilles, King Priam, Hector, Helen, and Paris in tow. It is a great sad story and to see it put to film in such a proper way is a real joy of film making from a fan's point of view.But why the professional critic's cynicism? Perhaps because of jealousy that Brad Pitt, as the legendary Greek warrior Achilles, can play a successful portrait with his athleticism, male sensitivity, and ultimate male brutishness that is so effective? Or is it that Peter O'Toole's character as Troy's King Priam is a tour-de-force and that critics have always loathed Peter for some reason - is he too good? Perhaps Hector played by Eric Bana is just a bit too human? That Paris' Orlando Bloom is ultimately a coward turned hero but in being so, in irony, kills in tragedy? That love is what sometimes causes wars? And maybe it is because the heroic women in this film, especially Helen, seen as a tragic painting by Diane Kruger, crushes the fragile male soul with her sad and hopeless ultimate beauty? Perhaps this movie is too close to human tragedy to be criticized by jaded movie critics?In capturing the soul of ""The Iliad's"" theme, this is indeed a film of epic tragedy. Everybody dies. Revenge is the cycle unbound and unending. The warrior kills until he is killed and then his champion's kill the killers. This is the cycle of the ancient world, the cycle that the civilized world seeks to unbind. In watching this film it is quick to analyze that the warrior's soul is not the way of mankind's successful future, and so this film in a way is good history lesson from the past tale of ""The Iliad"" and how not to be as a civilized world. Greek tragedy is an awesome ancient lesson that the modern world must learn from, and movie making as such does justice to popularize, but not glorify this image of tragedy. ""Troy"" directed by Wolfgang Peterson teaches this lesson.""Troy"" is a long film best viewed across either a lazy afternoon or two nights. The spectacle of ancient Mycenaean Greek battle is as authentic as the unknown of those times are to research from scant historical records. The weapons and tactics of the era in this movie are an attempt at authenticity, albeit a bit too much black leather going on. I think Achilles' armor would have been of the most polished brass of the time, not the dark fair that adorned the ultra fit Brad Pitt's form. But the shields, spears, swords, ships, chariots, and basic form of armor are historically correct as much as can be gleaned from rare records. The one on one battles depicted are violent and brutal, perhaps accurate, and if so, show a hacking time when man pitted upon man in ancient battle, makes the NFL look like a sewing circle.The sweep of ancient epic battles and walled cities is captured in this movie with a combination of effective digital effects and real life action. The widescreen transference from film to digital DVD is very well done without any noticed pixillation. And the women in this film's tears are heartbreakingly real. The soundtrack conveys a haunting sadness to the ear as if tragedy is always present.I was surprisingly pleased with ""Troy"" both from a technical, historical, story telling, and acting point of view. Highly recommended for it's type of film fair. Epic cinema at it's highest form. ""Troy"" is not quite ""Spartacus"" or ""Ben Hur"" but it wants to be, and is close to this type of film making.B. A.

Biggest letdown since Phantom Menace,"I went to see Troy with several expectations.  First, it would better than the USA movie ""Helen of Troy"" of 2003.  Better fight scenes, better dialogue, more truthful to the original story, and better cinematography. Second, Troy would be as complete in its characters as Peter Jackson's LOTR movies.  Third, a great musical score.  Fourth, a complete movie and not just a sequence of fight scenes.My last two expectations were fulfilled.  The musical score was perfect; orchestral - classical feel with grandeur and drama.  The movie flowed well and had enough dialogue and character development to balance out the blood, gore, and special effects.My first two expectations were unfulfilled.  The movie was very unfaithful to the original story by Homer.  Any adaption from literature must leave out stuff to save time and because some things cannot be shown, but only read. This I understand.  I also understand if scenes are shortened, or shown out of sequence in order to aid the audience.  But what I cannot fathom is why so much of the movie was very different from the original tale.  The death of Menelaus on the 2nd day of battle?  Achilles inside the Trojan Horse? Four arrows by Paris to kill Achilles instead of one?  The absence of Cassandra and Hecuba, the two most important female characters in the story after Helen.  And of course, the absence of any gods and goddesses to meddle with people's minds and hearts.  Instead the movie became a vehicle for Brad Pitt, his body, his athleticism, and his plain acting.  The movie should have been called Achilles instead of Troy.  The emphasis of the story also changed, from the original grand political soap opera caused by one bad romance (Helen - Paris); to a tale of two ill-fated romances (Achilles - Brises and Hector - Andromache) and one unfinished romance (Helen - Paris).Last, I was highly disgusted by the casting.  Outside of Hector, everyone looked AND sounded like northern Europeans.  This tale happened in the Mediterranean, yet I see British Bean as Odysseus, the German Kruger as Helen, Irish O'Toole as Priam, etc.  What the hell?  I didn't expect Troy to be as authentic as ""The Passion"" with all the actors learning Greek.  But they could have taken a look at Hunt for Red October.  Everyone on the Russian sub, including Sean Connery and Sam Neill attemped Russian accents. Get rid of Pitt, O'Toole, Bean, Bloom, and everyone else, and hire Greek and Turkish actors.  Tcheky Karyo would have made a great King Priam, and he is Turkish, which is where Troy sits.I give it 5 out of 10 stars; 1 for the music, 1 for the Hector-Achilles fight scene, 1 for the minimal gore to complement the great action sequences, and 2 for the great cinematography.  Everything else was a waste.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Classic battle,"This was a war about the battle for one woman. That sure does go along way. Wolfgang Peterson gives a special meaning to honor, loyalty, and betrayal in this drama based on the book ""The Illiad."" Helen and Paris give new meaning to the name of heartbreakers. Paris saw himself as somewhat of a so-called ""player"" who saw opportunity with Helen as his new love. Helen was unhappy with her marriage to Spartan king, Menelaus. They should have seen this coming. Menelaus becomes enraged and goes to his powerful brother, Agamemnon. Agamemnon calls all armies together to conquer Troy and get Helen back. With that, he summons Achilles, the world's greatest warrior known to man. Achilles does not like to serve under anyone but himself. Standing in the way is the Trojan King Priam. He is protected by his other son and warrior Hector. The battle scenes are great, especially Achilles and Hector. Fight to death!!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,History
A decent epic but far from flawless,"""Troy"" retells the epic story of Homer's ""The Iliad"", wherein the Greek army descends upon Troy in an attempt to reclaim the legendarily beautiful Helen of Troy.The basic story is of course familiar to most already, which doesn't exactly work in the film's favour. Nevertheless, the story is an entertaining one which modern visual effects bring to life in a vivid manner. Wolfgang Peterson's direction is well-handled throughout while James Horner's score is serviceable though not particularly remarkable.Unfortunately, the film's technical prowess is let down by some poor casting. I ought not to be surprised that in a multi-million dollar epic like this the producers focused on star power to drive the film. This led to some questionable casting choices. Brad Pitt & Eric Bana are not cut out for this sort of thing. A lot of their dialogue sounds stilted, although I must admit that they handle the physical aspects of their parts very well. Peter O'Toole hardly seems like his heart is in it (with the exception of one scene) and I don't think that I'd single out anyone at all as having given a standout performance.Nevertheless, if you enjoy epic films like me then you may find this one to your liking.

Silly (heterosexistic) crippled version of the poem...,"Well, I guess I don't have to repeat how shallow the movie is - others have done that here before. But what really made me angry was the way the script manipulated the poem, especially how it erased the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus and transferred Achilles' erotic/romantic interest to Briseis. What made this manipulation stranger was that actually in the movie Patroclus and Achilles behaved as male lovers would behave - yeah, OK, they were shown to be great friends but there isn't much of a difference between love and a very close friendship, is there? And I don't mean this in a homosexistic way (meaning that close friendship between men isn't possible without being sexual). But that's the way it is in the poem. This heterosexistic manipulation really robbed the movie of being a great chance in erasing 'gay' stereotypes or encouraging gay youth. Anyway, if you want to find out how it really was check out the chapter ""Achilles and Patroclus"" of Andrew Calimach's great collection of Greek myths (Andrew Calimach: Lovers' Legends. The Gay Greek Myths. Restored and Retold by Andrew Calimach. New Rochelle: Haiduk Press 2002). The book helped me a lot.",1.0,Anonymous,History

Did U read the book?,"My question is: Have U read the book? If U've read the book, this movie doesn't deserve a good mark.

Appealing interpretation of the myth,"I think many people complain about Troy's departures from the Iliad. But anyone who has ever actually read the Iliad knows that a screen by screen rehash of it probably would not work, it would involve a lot of CGI gods and warriors who seem like little more than chess pieces on the chess board of the gods.Personally, this is one of the few times changes to a story are actually appealing. In the Iliad the Greeks are portrayed as basically being the good guys, and since it is a Greek story that's understandable. But Troy reflects the differences in our culture and the world today than when the Iliad was written, and in an appealing way. No one in their right mind today would think it just an entire city destroyed and its people enslaved over a royal love triangle. So Troy just sort of brings to the surface the flaws in the Greek cause that are mostly ignored in the Iliad. Not normally a Brad Pitt fan, but he did a fine job as Achilles, added more depth to the character.****SPOLIERS**** Yes, it could have stuck a little closer to the myth, like the fates of Menelaus and Agamemnon, but it is a well worthwhile watch. Basically many things are the same, the Greeks still win with the wooden horse, Achilles still defeats Hector near the end, Paris still steals Helen. But you may find the changes appealing in surprising ways if you give the movie a chance.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"Brad Pitt proves he is an actor and ""Troy"" kicks off the summer!","Brad Pitt was much better than expected in this decent effort. It had some great moments, especially the one-on-one battles between Paris/Menelaus and Hector/Achilles. Many parts of the film were a little too over Movie-ized, like right before the Achilles/Hector fight when Hector says goodbye to everyone and shows his wife the secret passage out of the city to protect his son (who actually was thrown off a building during the siege). Eric Bana might as well have turned to the audience and winked, because anyone who did not know he was going to lose to Achilles after all of that must have been asleep. Plus, they condensed the Trojan War into a week! They made this big thing in the film about being remembered for thousands of years, and this was played up as the main reason Achilles went to the war, but all he did in the movie was fight one battle and duel Hector! The rest of the time he moped around in his tent, brooding and staring down Briseis until she slept with him. However, for anyone who was not familiar with the story of Troy, this would have been an excellent film, and there were definitely some great moments. The producers were pushing a little too hard for Oscar nods. They even had a song arranged to the score over the end credits! Plus, it was like ""see Brad Pitt cry! Give him an Oscar!"" Well, was certainly his finest performance to date, and overall a very enjoyable film if not based off of the Iliad.",9.0,Anonymous,History

In fact many of the parts of this epic puzzle were terrific...except for on thing. Many have compared this movie to Gladiator. I guess because they are both epic adventures with good looking heroes and heroins. Better or worse, who knows? ( I don't think so)... for this reason. The musical score in my opinion was horrendous.

Troy Sans the Gods?,"Troy is a great fun date film filled with exterior panorama shots that harken to the old David Lean Lawrence of Arabia views, and of course, Brad Pitt, who is buff enough to give a girl the vapors. Lordy!However, for anyone who has ever read Homer, and has an iota of recognition of the Oddessey, the absence of the Greek gods is a major disappointment. Hollywood of course went for the love story between lesser characters to play up the roles of Orlando Bloom and Brad Pitt, and this was more an annoyance when actors with chops including Peter O'Toole were on screen. The thin Hollywood pretty males looked decidedly underfed compared to the beefy Greek brothers from Sparta, and at times this was comical contrast in fight scenes between Orlando Bloom's Paris and Agamemnon.The important and tender scene between Hector (Eric Bana) and his wife (Saffron Burrows) and infant son were all but thrown out with the bath water in this production as was the friendship between Achillies and Petrocles. Can't Hollywood just leave Homer alone if it wants to make a movie where a boy loves girl, girl runs away with the boy, and Greece goes after her with 50,000 extras. I enjoyed the spectacle, but missed the substance, however, Brad Pitt's pecs were a mighty rush of lust for the wide screen. Once he dropped his leather skirt, who cared!",8.0,Anonymous,History
Ashley Cotton and the sons of Troy dress to impress!,"This is a sterling effort at the epic genre by legendary 'Never Ending Story' helmer, Wolfgang Peterson. First and foremost, the casting of the film is expertly done, with all of the best actors that come to mind cast so that blood ties become perfectly believable indeed.Brian Cox may get a gong or two for his deliciously despicable portrayal of Agammenon that is so evil and conceited the audience - and a British one at that - cheered when he was killed.The cinematography is absolutely stunning and their are some brilliant wide-angle sweeps over the battles that bring the story to brutal realistic life. One problem with the battles, however, is that the close up work lacks continuity and appears like a sort of 'highlights' clips package.THe sets, costumes and style of the film cannot be faulted really. THere were some greeks next to me in the cinema and they all seemed perfectly happy to gasp and whoop in all the right places.There is a camp-factor about it all, with the guys getting their bums out all of the time and a particularly homo-erotic sparring session between Achilles (a brilliant, on form Pitt) and his cousin where they giggle like little girls, fighting with a veritable 'Ohh, smack my bum and I'll hit yours harder' attitude.That's before Bean shows up to break it up and talk some man-sense! He's great and steals the show as usual. Eric Bana is so much harder than Achilles - he's a natural warrior, whereas Achilles is a gods-blessed cheat - and their final battle was one of the most excruciatingly tense one-on-ones I've ever seen.Lovely music that sounds like a combination of Gladiator and Titanic. An absolutely essential blockbuster for 2004. 7.5/10WARNING: This film is completely ruined at the climax when 'Eastender's Ashley Cotton appears for a cameo.

A decent account of the trojan war,"This movie is an optical extravaganza.Impressive sets,costumes,beautiful actors and amazing battle scenes.

Cinema more wooden than the Trojan Horse,"I heard that several years ago, Val Kilmer starred as Moses in a musical version of the Ten Commandments. As horribly bad as the prospect of that ""epic"" may seem, there is no feasible way in which it could have surmounted the dizzying heights of badness that this egregious disaster attains. They started with a bad script and simply worked their way down. The writing would actually be quite brilliant as some kind of satire on recent epics of the sword and sandal mode, such as Gladiator. Presented in the absolutely deadpan, robotic performances or Mr Pitt, Mr Bloom and company only accentuates the plain poor quality of the script. Check out the quotes page to experience just a taste of the awesome mediocrity in almost every line. David Benioff shows himself to be a contemporary William McGonogall in taking the eloquence of Homer's verse and converting it into this. He is the worst kind of Hollywood hack. The direction is just terrible. Actors wander around the set aimlessly, striking suitably macho poses, speaking their lines as if, like Bela Lugosi, they have learnt their lines phonetically. It is a bit like watching an amateur production of Shakespeare, but without even a good text. Brad Pitt is laughable as Achilles, far from the mythic, complex character depicted in any proper representation of the myth. His style here channels McCauley Culkin, as he struts around acting like a contemptible brat (showing off his enviable pecs simultaneously). Orlando Bloom presumably intends to portray a classic Paris who is more idealistic lover than warrior, but he comes across as an effeminate fourteen-year-old boy. Eric Bana is fine actor and usually a charismatic presence, but here he serves primarily as muscle-bound eye-candy. The leading ladies are not even worth mentioning. Peter O'Toole is the exception, displaying utmost professionalism, but you can somehow tell that he really did not enjoy making this picture. The special effects are rubbish. There is nothing epic about a battle which appears to be made up of about ten guys and a billion CGI clones. Effects of this nature somehow turn out to be both absurdly grandiose and rather pathetic at the same time. Cecile B DeMille may have had the subtlety of a Soviet diplomat, but at least he didn't cheat his audience, opting to do things the proper way. I'm sure the filmmakers could have paid for tens of thousands of extras using half of Brad Pitt's salary alone, so, for me, these lazily constructed CGI effects just aren't good enough. The score is utterly horrible. I read on the trivia page that the music was composed in 1 1/2 months after Warner Bros. rejected Gabriel Yared's effort. It most certainly shows. The the middle eastern-style vocalisation was reasonably fairly effective in the opening, but very quickly grated with overuse. Other elements of the score included (now) clichéd percussive passages (suspiciously similar to parts of Apocolypto), the likes of which have been done much, much better by Howard Shore and others, and sweeping faux-romantic orchestral music, some hideous bastard-child of early Berlioz and John Williams, alternately sugar coated and (no doubt intended to be) epic. I also noticed a few instances of less-than-subtle plagiarism, shamelessly ripping-off Shostakovich and others. James Horner has produced some respectable work, but this is not in that category. I loathe it almost as much as his deplorably saccharine Titanic theme. To sum up, this film (sorry, movie; film implies artistic merit/intentions) owes absolutely nothing to Homer, besides an apology. It to the Illiad what I, Robot is to the memory of Isaac Asimov. I thought that the sacking of temple of Apollo in the film was an apt unconscious metaphor. I am aware that cinema and epic poetry are two entirely disparate mediums, but this does not even stand up as a movie. It is truly appalling. The only benefits that could possibly be derived from Troy are the hours of fun you and your friends will have bagging it out after you pick it up out the bargain bin in a few years.

Big disappointment,"To make it short: I expected to see an epic action-filled masterpiece. But the first half of that movie was boring: neither screenplay, directing, music, camera nor actors were satisfactory. You only get the full bundle of monotonous dialogues and not much action in the first 60 minutes! One word to the music: in my opinion it is absolutely misplaced: when it should set the i-dot to some scene it only destroys it because it kills the camera dramatics.After 60 or 70 minutes the movie gets better, the actors (I liked Eric Bana most) also (but it's hard to love Brad Pitt in that movie).And there is also good music (stolen from Gladiator: woman's ""crying"" voice) and a ""stolen"" big battle scene that can't beat the perfect ones of LOTR II / III. Unfortunately the scriptwriter also changed the lyrical order in a very liberal way.The movie tries to show you how a city/ a room (even a king's audience room) looked like at that time. So it tries to transport you into another time. That's the good news. Bad thing is that this doesn't let the movie look like a multi-million dollar epic...So they get you into the cinema with that bombastic trailer, but then...I can only hope that the director of ""day after tomorrow"" which will start these days has done a better job.Conclusion: If you want to see a good epic tale you should watch ""Ben Hur"" or ""Gladiator"" or LOTR, but don't expect too much from this ""Troy"".",7.0,Anonymous,History

"this is good and fresh, a true remake","In fact, while I initially rate it an 8 overall, I may raise the rating. i rarely rate a movie with a 10 immediately. It has to sink in.That said, this story is the Iliad, with little amendments here and there, and yet, it is still the most faithful to Homer's original. Yet, the clever rewrite makes it superior.The Iliad was originally about the disagreement between Agammemon and Achilles. The former is portrayed true to form. He is supposed to be a cruel, stubborn character. So is Achilles. This movie is actually the truest to the book, of all the movies.The clever rewriting gives a good look at the war, and gives a credible account, even more credible than the poem of old. And who really knows what the original story was, since it was changed so many times before being put to print. And various generations would fit in their own versions to suit the rulers of the time. After all, it was to rulers that bards sang.For those who don't know, Troy is ruled by Priam, whose oldest son, Hector, is a valiant fighter, and his younger son, Paris, a lady's man. Paris absconds with the wife of Meneleus, Helen of Troy, which sends the Greeks to Ilium (Troy), which most people assume to be Turkey.Now this is a romanticized reason. And the real reasons for war were supposed to be for monetary trade reasons (probably spices). At any rate, other more realistic reasons are given in the movie.But the movie is more than just the war. It explores the characters much better than Homer ever did. We think of Homer as a great poet, but in truth, he (or they, since Homer is considered to be more than one poet) is overrated. The characters are quite identifiable, and they draw us into this world of war.The acting and directing is stellar. Pitt actually reminds a viewer of Crowe, and he gives a subtle, but unmistakeably great acting job. In fact, this is made possible because the entire cast is superb. And in such a case, one must credit the director and editors, too. An all around top job by the entire crew.The movie is long, but not boring. It quickly flows from action to action, from consequence to consequence.I didn't think I would like this movie. This was an excellent movie. It is a true remake, because it adds elements of its own to make a story we can accept, believe, and watch.Big thumbs up.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Alexander's Twin in Every Way,"Here we go again.In viewing TROY I kept getting references to category romance novels. Of course, anyone who reads this is probably going to on scratch his or her head and on this basis alone vote against this review but what the hell -- I can't change my points of view. Certainly not when the results are as weak as this. But I digress: see, the reason I join two genres that couldn't be more far apart has its madness.See, category romances (for those who are unfamiliar with the term) are short two hundred-page novels that publishing houses churn out month after month and all of them tell the same kind of love story with slight variations. Oliver Stone and Wolfgang Peterson, two very respected directors who have created much better work, have decided to film the same kind of movie -- sword and sandal epics -- with slight variations and coinciding in time of release and with interchangeable actors. Instead of Colin Farrell, we have Brad Pitt who is Fabio with acting power. Instead of Angelina Jolie we have... well, no female who registers, since the actress Diane Kruger doesn't have the oomph to play Helen of Troy. Speaking of Helen and digressing again, when confronted with what must have been the most beautiful woman in history, her beauty rivaling Aphrodite, it wouldn't have killed the makers of this film to leave Helen as a hazy, brightly lit but barely seen figure. Since feminine mystery is what drives the plot, why not leave it as such? Food for thought.Also adding to the mix we have Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom, both fresh out of blockbuster films, playing Hector and Paris, respectively. And Peter O'Toole, the only actor of the veterans here (which includes Julie Christie) whose part as Priam at least is worthy of something. Overall TROY felt, to me, that I could have seen any one of these movies and not known the difference (much like a romance novel) despite that one of them is a historic epic and the other a mix of history and legend which borrows freely from Homer's ""THE ILIAD"" but keeps the gods at bay. At least one fares secondary characters that I could somehow attach some meaning to, but even then, this is a film which in trying to be ""epic"" sinks under its pretensions, much like its twin Alexander.",5.0,Anonymous,History

"""I fear the Greeks, even when they bring gifts.""","Wolfgang Petersen's ""Troy"" is well-directed, well-acted, and the production value is very well done. However, this film follows in the footsteps of many other superior films that all make their point more strongly than this one. It is a very competent film, but I think is little more than a large-scale spectacle movie that is lost amidst all the sub-plots and characters. Had this been a six-hour mini-series on television, it probably would have played better with these many characters. Very distinct echoes of ""Saving Private Ryan"" and, most especially ""Gladiator"" are very noticable throughout this film. Even the score for this film is almost directly plagarized from ""Gladiator"". The one thing that distinguishes this film from the others of its kind is the question of who to care for more: The Greeks or the Trojans? On one hand, we have the Greeks, who have entered this war for glory and revenge. Their king, Agamemmnon (Brian Cox) is a power-hungry madman. Their greatest warrior, Achilles (Brad Pitt) is a fearsome and brutal killer who does so for his own glory and eternal fame. Then we have the Trojans, who are fighting this war at their doorstep because of the love of the prince Paris (Orlando Bloom) has taken Helen (Diane Kruger), the wife of another Greek king, Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson) who is brother to Agamemmnon, back to Troy with him, severing the fragile peace that the Greeks and Trojans have just made. The king of Troy, Priam (An excellent Peter O'Toole) has no desire for war, but will fight to protect his son and his city. There is also Prince Hector (An excellent Eric Bana, who can finally live down ""The Hulk"") who is a great but reluctant warrior who wants no more fighting so that he can live and be a husband and father. However, fate and the gods seem to conspire against all who inhabit this world. From what I understand, this film has taken liberties with the ""history"" of this story and made it a modern re-telling with flawed and decidedly modern-type characters instead of the legends of mythology. Unfortunately, there is a great deal of confusion and obvious suspensions-of-disbelief with many of the characters. Another element that this film suffers from is its frenetic battle scenes. The editing makes it very difficult to tell who is who a great deal of the time. Also, some of the performances are a little flat. Pitt, who I think is a wonderful actor who has shown in films like ""se7en"", ""Ocean's Eleven"", and ""Fight Club"" that he is more than just a pretty face and well-chiseled body. But as Achilles, he tends to wander a bit. Bloom, whose Legolas in ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy catapulted him to stardom and his role in ""Pirates of the Carribean"" only helped to solidify him as one of the next big things, is very one-note. Meanwhile, it is the women who suffer the most. Kruger, and Saffron Burrows, as the wife of Hector, have very little to do other than cry a lot and look pretty. Cox, who has his share of great performances from ""Manhunter"" to ""L.I.E."" sees fit to portray Agamemmnon as a brutal savage with no mercy and is the biggest cookie-cutout character of all of the players. The player in this film that will probably go unrecognized for his great work is the great Sean Bean for his wise and heartfelt portrayal of Odysseus. This is decent summer fare, but don't expect it to perform at the Oscars as well as ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Gladiator"".",7.0,Anonymous,History
Don't listen: It's great! PART 1,"All film buffs spend a good deal of time imagining what movies they would make if they only had a chance. For years, I've been thinking up various cinematic adaptations of The Iliad, which is probably my single favorite work of literature. I would not have come up with the same film Wolfgang Petersen has, but I am satisfied with it. In fact, regarding its reception by critics, both amateur and professional, I would say that my expectations were wildly exceeded. I quite loved the film. Yes, it is far from perfect, but it succeeds beautifully. I was especially pleased and impressed with the impeccable casting. I think I'm the only one who feels this way, but there is not a single character, not one, who is miscast.Yes, that includes Achilles, played by Brad Pitt. Pitt has received all kinds of flak, but he is as good an Achilles as I could imagine. I don't even like Pitt as an actor generally; the only other performance of his I like is in Twelve Monkeys. That, although it served its purpose well, was a performance of twitches. This performance shows more maturity than the actor has ever demonstrated before, and perhaps suggests that he might someday be a truly formidable actor, instead of the pretty boy star he is always dismissed as. You can just feel the violence oozing off of Achilles' body as he charges into battle after deadly battle. Pitt has the presence to make Achilles the lion that he says he is. But it's not only the presence that Pitt has. He also successfully demonstrates Achilles' existential dilemma throughout the picture. I really do think Pitt gives an Oscar-worthy performance.Eric Bana plays the film's second lead, Hector, and the film works just as well under his performance. Bana is definitely an actor who will figure prominently in the years to come. He was fine in last year's Hulk, but here he doesn't have to compete with a CGI version of himself for dominance. Orlando Bloom, who is also suffering a lot under the critics, is Paris, and, in my opinion, is perfect. His fight scene with Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson, one of my favorite current character actors) is the film's greatest moment. Brian Cox, who never disappoints, is Agamemnon. Peter O'Toole is fine as Priam, and, although I didn't think he was given quite enough to do, his confrontation with Achilles near the end of the film is as powerful as the scene in the Iliad. Rose Byrne plays Briseis, a character who figures more prominently in this film than in the original poem. This works well, and Byrne's scenes with Pitt are excellent. Sean Bean (Boromir from The Lord of the Rings) gave my favorite performance of the film as Odysseus.Perhaps the only real disappointment is Diane Kruger's Helen. A German, she makes the classic acting blunder of fluctuating in her accent. She seems like an American at first, but then her German accent starts slipping in from time to time. Kruger may have fared better if the screenwriter, David Benioff, had handled Helen's character better. As far as the characters go, Helen is the only one who isn't handled very well in the script. It's easy to see how Helen could get lost in the proceedings; after all, she's a difficult character to figure. Even the Greek authors after Homer had a difficult time dealing with her. They never really understood her role in the story, nor her intentions. Of course, that's not true when you're actually dealing with Homer's two epics; I think Helen comes off as a very strong character in both The Iliad and The Odyssey, and her character is consistent between the two.*continued below*(further comments were destroyed by jackass IMDb editors)",9.0,Anonymous,History
Nowhere near as good as Gladiator! Brad Pitt is no Russell Crowe!,"I can't help but compare this to 'Gladiator' and find 'Troy' sadly wanting. 'Gladiator' was one of my favorite films of recent years and I thought Russell Crowe was magnificent as Maximus. (Sure the film had some issues, but the good far outweighs the bad for me). You absolutely believed him as a soldier and general and a man of the ancient world.The same cannot be said of 'Troy.' Brad Pitt as Achilles is the big Achilles heel of the film. (Sorry, couldn't resist). He doesn't have the necessary heft as an actor and seems to expect his newly muscled physique to be enough. It isn't. He's fine when he's in combat scenes, but whenever he opens his mouth, his ""now you hear it, now you don't"" British accent is embarrassing. Especially alongside real British actors, like the always excellent Sean Bean. (Thank goodness Bean gets to provide the opening and closing narration as Odysseus. Can't get enough of his marvelous voice!)Apart from Brad's woeful acting is the presentation of the character of Achilles as a very unheroic hero. He's basically a glory-seeking jerk, all about individual acclaim and definitely not a team player, kind of the Kobe Bryant of the Greeks. He doesn't care about country or king (true, his king is corrupt), but compared to the noble and far superior character of Hector, we instinctively root for Hector. Eric Bana as Hector is the real hero of this film and whenever he's on screen, the movie actually works. Eric, all is forgiven for ""The Hulk!""To paraphrase a Gladiator quote (as this film does freely in its familiar dialogue), Achilles has the strength, but Hector has the honor. At one point, one of Achilles' men tells him, ""To serve you has been the greatest honor of my life,"" but we never see why. Sure he's a great warrior, but he's disrespectful of all authority and frankly a self-centered brat. All he cares about his himself and his cousin. Hector is the true leader here, making the hard choices and taking the brunt of the fallout from Paris' rash decision to take Helen to Troy.The rest of the cast is mostly good. Orlando Bloom plays Paris as an experienced ladies' man but inexperienced and frankly bad warrior, which worked for me. Some of his dialogue is naive and laughable, but I think people were laughing at the character, not the actor.The only other actor I had a problem with was the girl who plays Briseis. She was extremely annoying and her whole love storyline with Brad Pitt was completely uninvolving and only slowed down the film.And I'm not an expert on the Iliad, but I do know that Agamemnon meets with a different end than in this film. Read the play 'Elektra!'Overall, I give the film a 7/10. Worth seeing, if you can tolerate Brad Pitt for nearly three hours. By the end of the film, I was actually cheering for him to be taken down, I hated him and his character that much. And did they ever explain why Achilles is invincible? If they did, I missed it. I think they should have explained it for the majority of people who are unfamiliar with The Iliad.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Great Summer Movie,"The movie is not as bad as some critics had hoped it would be, and I suspect that some reviews were written even before the film was released. Some reviewers' prejudice appears in their selective gripes--attacking Brad Pitt's Midwestern accent as inappropriately Homeric, but saying nothing of Eric Bana's rather more pronounced Australian accent--or overpraising the fine contributions of British actors Peter O'Toole and Brian Cox as backhanded critiques of Pitt's fine physical performance as Achilles. Both Pitt and Bana are terrific in this movie, and, sure, the movie doesn't measure up to Homer's Iliad (someone expected it to?), but it's good entertainment and perhaps Hollywood's best representation of the ancient world since Anthony Mann's ""The Fall of the Roman Empire."" I agree with Roger Ebert that computer-generated visuals add nothing to the movie (already they look as phony and dating as the old rear-screen projections of the 1950s). Also, Garret Hedlund's debut as Patrocles and Julie Christie's cameo as Achilles' mother are fairly unimpressive. Still, the movie depicts heroic and craven behavior on both sides of the war, without taking sides, and depicts the human cost of warfare and the nobility of principled warriors and humane leaders--in this respect, ""Troy"" is a lot like Homer and unlike such constipated, vicious, yet critically praised historical epics as ""Braveheart.""",8.0,Anonymous,History

As with all good big-budget, star-studded, action-packed overwrought quasi-historical epics, ""Troy"" is as memorable for its follies (the horribly miscast Pitt as Achilles, the uninspiring Diana Kruger as Helen, the annoying as hell Orlando Bloom as Paris, the pretty-boy homo-erotic nature of it all) as it is for its triumphs (the massive sets and fantastically choreographed battle scenes, the scene-stealing performance from Peter O'toole as King Priam, the deliciously vile Brian Cox as the ruthless Agamemnon, and the star-making turn from Eric Bana as Hector).Thankfully Peterson is an old-school director, so despite Pitt's posturing and male model stares that reminded me of Ben Stiller's hilarious ""blue steel"" look from ""Zoolander"" and a painfully stale script that doesn't allow the viewer to root for anyone, he avoids all flash and music-video style editing to give the film its refreshingly old-fashioned look and its ""this is an epic from another era"" pace. Both of these welcome throwbacks to the heyday of Cecil B. DeMille make the film itself more endearing (albeit in a very dull way) than any of the wishy-washy characters parading in togas across the movie screen. In the end, with nary an authentic Greek to be seen in the cast of thousands, varying degrees of wavering British accents and the reduction of a richly layered and complex centuries old legend into a single two and half hour Hollywood movie, Homer is probably rolling over in his ferry on the river Styx, but I still enjoyed my popcorn and passed a few hours of my time.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Better than the original,"Homer's Illiad is a timeless epic adventure, but let's face it, it would never survive as a modern book. The characters make many long winded speeches, there are long stretches of nothing happening, and the gods are constantly (and I mean CONSTANTLY) interfering. It's incredible that the book has survived 3000 years and it's a fascinating snapshot of ancient history, but as a story, it's hard to get into.This adaptation takes many liberties that enhance the story. Timeframes are necessarily compressed (how do you keep up the tension during a 10 year siege?) and there are a couple of love interests introduced to keep the ladies interested. (The girls are easy on the eyes for the men too.) Hector has been changed to be much more noble (pun intended), and the constant interference from deities is gone (and that's a good thing, although perhaps they went a little too far).However, the essence of the characters and the tragedy are intact. Achilles is portrayed as a murderous thug seeking glory and missing in purpose, and the Trojans as the honorable heroes doomed to defeat. The theme and underlying feeling of Homer's story is also intact, but with incredible visuals. It's too bad the story centers on vast expanses of boring sand, but the armies and their battles fill the screen to bursting. It was also fascinating to watch ancient fighting styles. The screenplay shows us a precursor to the Roman way of fighting that created an empire.Overall an excellent movie. Pitt's performance was the standout here. He had just the right mix of arrogance and sadness, and the moves, to be Achilles. Put this with his performance in Snatch and we see a truly good actor, not just another Hollywood hunk.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Good action flick,"If you are looking for a rendition of the Iliad don't watch this movie! If you know the basic history/myth and are OK with the standard movie modifications of the books they are based on then you should like this movie.

Not so bad as it was made to look from other men's comments,"Troy is truly one of the major cinema events this year.The movie has it all - big budget,great cast and a spectacular storyline.And moreover the money was spent on purpose,the great cast produced a great performance...But there are many that would spit on the movie and say it's a crap.But why?Let's begin analyzing this.First we have the people that hate commercial movies,they would generally claim that every movie with a budget over 10 mil is worthless.I ,myself,hate commercialization too in a way ,but can you explain to me how can I properly depict the siege of Troy without the appropriate funds?Second we have those who hated the adaptation of the ""Iliad"".But history has proved that following a certain book blindly is disastrous for the movie.And who the hell would want to watch a ten-year war with one battle in it(""Helen of Troy"")?The absence of the gods is all for the better as it show that even mere humans can be great heroes.Third - poor performance on behalf of some actors?No,I haven't noticed much of that.I personally hate Brad Pitt and I would have given him the Oscar for the part of Achilles.And Eric Bana was even better.No,he was the best!Peter O'Tool,Sean Bean,Orlando Bloom - all played perfectly.I have some remarks on the acting of Brian Cox however...I could go on writing like this forever beating all of the arguments of the anti-Troy trust.I personally think this is the best epic since Gladiator we were given the chance to see.So don't miss it if you haven't seen it.You'll be pleased with it,I promise.",10.0,Anonymous,History

The simplistic  version,"This is a reasonable enough attempt at the Troy myth. The fight and battle scenes are very good; the best part of the whole film. The technical aspects too are strong.However where this film falls apart is that it is a comic book version of the story. The dialog is utterly banal. It's not bad; it's just boring and banal. It's all super heroes and super strength.This myth is not just strong for the story, it's because it was treated by really great writers in a number of plays and poems. Homer, Aeschylus and Euripides were really great writers.Take Euripides's ""The Trojan Women"" which was made into a movie in 1971. That retains the tragic destruction of war and the obsession with pride amongst other themes.This movie has epic fights egos from the warriors but the other themes are all absent. The other characters, the women in particular are non existent.For a young audience that lack of depth is probably fine enough but it's like so many film versions of classic works, its not even close to being the real thing.",3.0,Anonymous,History
A tragedy but not a tragedy,"I would love to be cynical about the film but in good faith i cannot. When i first found out that Brad Pitt was to take on the role of Achillis i was somewhat weary of the result. But i was not disappointed in the least. Although there were a lot of close-ups of hunky Brad it did no damage to the movie. Achillis was a warrior who became a legend. There is nothing wrong with emphasizing his perfection. However, i cannot but say that Eric Bana, Peter O'Toole and Rose Byrne stole the show. Eric Bana portrayed a character so deep that one cannot but get enthralled in the movie. Peter O'Toole is excellent as a proud and forlorn father and Rose Byrne was magnificent as a woman torn. ALthought the film does not stay true to the actual book, i am not disappointed. This was a great Hollywood attempt at summarizing and hollywoodizing a great historical event. It would have been impossible otherwise. The musical score however, did not find my fancy.. The fight scenes were original, unique and altogether mastered. This tragedy is definitely not a tragedy",,Anonymous,History
Myth understanding,"SPOILER, assuming you don't know who won the Trojan War.I haven't read The Iliad in decades, but wasn't Achilles invulnerable (like Superman), because as a baby he was dipped in the River Styx by his mother, except for one heel which she used to hold him? I am sure I am not making this up. So this means he would be incapable of being wounded (no lover would be able to cut his throat), and his mother would know about this quality. In this film, I am not sure anyone knew, or even if the invulnerability was a factor. The only blood I saw on Brad/Achilles was not his own.No scars visible on the 98% of Brad's body we were shown. But wasn't Achilles killed by a poison arrow? In the heel? Achilles without a heel is like Cyrano without a nose.It would have been interesting to explore the character of a brave warrior who knows he cannot be hurt. Is there any real bravery if you know you cannot be hurt? Patroclus stole Achilles' armor but could not steal Achilles' real protection. And how could Achilles hold Hector in such contempt if Achilles were indeed invulnerable, when Hector risked all and Achilles risked nothing?The movie played as though invulnerability was not a factor. Maybe the movie makers decided to scrap the myth. But if Achilles was not invulnerable, his survival of countless battles without a scratch is totally ludicrous.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"If not for potential, then for other things!","The fact that not much digital technology is used in the movie, is always a plus. It adds to the feel of reality and the watcher is taken into the world. The movie is epic, no doubt, but the potential to be even more epic was there. The possible potential is made up by the acting talent. Peter O'Toole plays Priam with such ease and confidence, it's sickening. Eric Bana IS Hector. He becomes his character. (That's all I have to say about that!) Orlando Bloom always plays the innocent part well and lives up to the wimpy-prince Paris image. Brad Pitt as Achilles, need I say any more about this?

"Certainly a cut above its director's usual forté of English language films, Troy isn't without serious flaw but sustains enough interest and drama to its conclusion.","Wolfgang Peterson's Troy opens with a voice-over proposing to us as to whether or not famous tales; stories of bravery and bloody warfare; fables about the rise and consequent falls of famous nations, kings and civilisations and heroic, blood-thirsty warriors as well as their actions will ever be remembered or recalled over the ages - whether people will ask as to how what happened, happened. It would seem the answer is ""yes"", but only if it's ever really distilled through the filter Peterson waters-down the tales of old he puts on screen here, and put out to a common-place audience in the manner that it is. If the aim of the film was to educate or inform or make those aware of the sorts of stories and content this piece puts to the screen, then Troy is ancient Greek mythology for the generation of social networkers; a three hour or so slog through warriors and their tirades, family affairs and love lives, a sweeping; scything; swooping film complete with overly dramatic delivery and the odd burst of orchestral music to emphasise drama and expansiveness. Provided with this in mind, it is a wonder that it at all works to the degree that it does.The film predominately covers two young men from two separate warring side as well as an awful lot in between. Eric Bana's Hector is a Prince to the higher-ups of Troy; a warrior but a politician and a philosopher as well as a mentoring figure to Orlando Bloom's Paris, his brother; Hector is a proud man, pleased that peace exists for the time being where he is based. Then there is Brad Pitt's Achilles, a fearsome warrior with long blonde locks and a stern expression; a man we first encounter in bed with a woman whom looks as if she might have just fallen out of a modern day centrefold shoot, a man effectively a mercenary-for-hire who's late for a large battle his employer, Brian Cox's Greek king Agamemnon, is about to instigate but negates any trouble with both his gyp and his unworldly ability to perform in a one-on-one fight. The situation these people and these kingdoms find themselves in is narrated orally to us in that manner that makes it sound like this is the most important tale you'll ever hear. Agamemnon, the power hungry tyrant, wants Troy and control of its surrounding area; mixed up amidst all of this is Brendan Gleeson's Menelaus, a man angry at those from Troy due to Paris' swiping of his wife Helen (Kruger), whom has fallen in love with Paris and has consequently eloped.Things escalate, with Achilles tempted into working with Agamemnon and his cronies of which include Sean Bean's (disapointingly cast as the grizzled 'tough-guy' once again and proving that 2007's Far North is the best thing he's done in a while) Odysseus, so much so that asking his mother for help merely sees her provide advice along the lines of: being famous and remembered throughout history beneath this mirage of 'celebrity status' is good; and lopping people's heads off for a living when you aren't driving swords trough their chests is a pretty decent way to go about attaining said status. The film, despite being set thousands of years ago, carries an annoyingly polished feel to it since there is very little grub and grime to proceedings, despite the unusually brave overall downcast nature Peterson applies to the material which was always ripe for that of being poorly played.The film is driven by rather beautiful, somewhat unrealistically photogenic people such as Pitt; Bana; Bloom and Kruger, each of whom come across as sympathetic as the film can possibly make them regardless of role and are in stark contrast to the older and wearier Gleeson and Cox whom are tyrannical, aggressive, all conquering and vengeful in a far uglier fashion. Achilles' gradual falling out with his king and employer Agamemnon sees Cox inform Pitt that ""no-body will remember him"" as ""history only recognises the kings from centuries gone by"" - information I'm not sure on what he's basing, since it was the actions of a fair few from around about this era which has gone on to spawn such thinking; not, with his dreams of stardom and fame, something Pitt wants to here. Their gradual falling out feels more-so symptomatic of this distinction the film makes between the 'young' and 'old' performers more than it does because two rounded characters are genuinely disagreeing.One cannot watch the film with a certain nagging sensation at the back of one's head, critical observations of 2000's Gladiator about how various feuds were instigated by way of trash-talking and calling one's opponent out alá a contemporary wrestling or boxing match rearing its head at specific points. There is some interesting material later on to do with Hector's battle he has with his council members more broadly linked to theology, proving the film can when it wants to have its 'pretty boy' leads fall foul of the elders therein on more substantial grounds when it wants to, but this sort of stuff is few and far between. Soap opera narrative aside and while it is generally allover the place, I was surprised by how much I came to be involved in the plights of its characters; Troy a war film with an eye on the more grandeur or scoped nature of battle but with an additional, more mature and more downcast eye on the love these characters have for one another behind the scenes. Very little is ultimately won in Troy but an awful lot is lost, and its perception of war as an ugly and terrible thing which does nobody any favours rings rather depressingly true when two supremely advanced nations are unable to come together and instead come to fight. Troy is a thoroughly mixed bag of tricks but one just about worth catching.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"If at first you don't succeed, Troy, Troy, again...","It constantly amazes me how, despite the uncounted original works of fiction that have never seen conversion to celluloid, Hollywood continues its tedious remake schedule of old, already done-to-death films. Of course, Hollywood covers up this trend with the new buzz-word ""re-imagining"", to describe this remake trend. But a remake is still just  a remake, no matter how badly you muck about with the story and characters or how many CGI effects you can cram in.So it is with Troy. Though not an awful film by any means, it really doesn't stand out as anything memorable. In fact, it had the feel of one of those old Italian sword-and-sandals epics from yesteryear, just with better known actors.The film moves along at a good pace and there is plenty of action, but it's not really edge of the seat stuff. Most of the actors give OK performances but the only one who seemed to have any passion for the role was Eric Bana, as Hector. The others just seemed to plod along. Orlando Bloom didn't seem at all comfortable with his role, at least, not until he had a bow in his hands. Peter O'Toole gave one of his usual ""I might launch into a manic moment at any time"" performances, though mercifully, he never does. And Brad Pitt.....Hmmm. Brad Pitt as Achilles, a legendary hero. Well, I have to admit that he certainly worked out a great deal and looked great. But he didn't seem to me to project the commanding power that the role required. Maybe if he'd been a few inches taller.....Overall there isn't much plot. The whole film is just an excuse for one battle scene after another. It's as if the writers decided that the audience knew the basic plot anyway, so they didn't need to do anything other than write ""insert battle scene here"" at various points in the script. In fact, this is a rare occasion for me. I have to say that I felt the battles actually got in the way of any story there might have been quite badly. As a result the movie is essentially one long series of battles interspersed with idle chatter and thin attempts to develop the characters.Oh, and how Wolfgang and Co must have laughed at their little ""Achilles' Heel"" joke at the end. That was one of the most awful contrived moments I've seen for a long time. Laugh it up Wolfgang....made your money back yet?All in all it entertains, though it is definitely NOT destined to be remembered alongside such old epics as Ben Hur or The Ten Commandments. Watch this movie for the battle scenes, which, whilst well done, are most definitely overhyped. Supposedly the most gory and realistic battle scenes committed to celluloid, they are, nonetheless, quite ordinary as far as I am concerned and could have benefited from some imaginative choreography.Not bad, but not good either.",7.0,Anonymous,History

But: if english is not your native language you also have to read the subtitles! And you just don't have the time to capture the whole image on the screen and read whatever they are saying. Another thing is that I expected more acting and less fighting. I had set my hopes on Brad Pitt who has proven many times to be a great actor. In this film his character is ""flat"" and all you learn about Achilles is his passion for fighting. Then again it was fun to see Brad in a mini-skirt :-)If you are not from another planet you know from the beginning that Troy is going to fall. The director did a great job on letting you sympathize with the people of Troy and with Achilles and his army. Anoying part in the movie is the story about Helena and Orlando Bloom; I think it was just there because people like a lovestory in a movie and to get younger people (girls) to the cinema as well because of Orlando Bloom.Overall it was a nice lesson in Greek History, impressive to watch, and poor acting.

From the beginning of the movie i was hooked. Also i do have to hand it to Brad Pitt because he did very well, if he was angry you could tell and if he was in sorrow you could tell. Not many actors or actresses have that talent anymore. Even though i am a fan of Orlando Bloom i do have to say that his performance in the movie was vague. I don't think he showed a lot of character. I also liked how the director got a unknown actress to play Helen because if he didn't than no one in Hollywood could ever fill out the character. What i mean is, if he had gotten some A-lister then we would have already known their past work and could have compared and so on. But with an unknown we don't really know of any other work so it would be completely new, also in a weird way refreshing, because, knowing that some big Hollywood actor or actress got the job i think would have ruined the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,History

It is OK,"I have mixed feeling about this one. Overall, for such a massive epic movie it is well made. Particularly battles scenes. Acting by Brad Pitt, Peter O'Toole and Eric Bana is great. Draws you into it. But. Overall there is little passion. Except may be the scene where Priam sneaks to Achilles' camp to pick up Hector's body.It more looks like actors are there to deliver their lines and proceed to the next scene.Particularly Paris and Helen. You would think that if a nation goes to war because of these two, it must be worth it? But, there is no much passion in their relationship, no chemistry. Helen is out of place on the set really. And Paris (Ken Bloom) has no character (other than being a coward). IMO, the film would have benefited by showing more personal drama, better dialogue and acting when trying to show the turmoil the characters were going through. So less massive epic battle scene, more character development would balance the movie and bring it to the next level.Then, for an R-rated movie the ""gore sex and nudity"" part is rather timid. Especially ""sex and nudity"" part. Sort of tokenized. Show chiseled Pitt's body for female audience and a couple of beautiful women's behinds for male audience. The two sex scene (that I recall) are laughable.IMO, you either do not include these at all and make it PG-13, or go full hardcore.

"Bad acting, Terrible story pretty backdrops","Wow this is my first review and I've got to say what a disappointment this film was.

He was completely unlikeable and i didn't really want to watch his character at all.The story was completely unbelievable and the script was also terrible in many places, you might have well have set this film in space in the 23rd century for all the relevance it had to real life or historical facts.I would really love to go on lambasting this film for all that it could have been but i think I've conveyed my opinion on it and any more words would be a waste of my time and yours.A typical rubbish action ""Hollywood"" film, such a disappointment.On a side note, one redeeming feature were the fight scenes which were excellently crafted (although the stretch towards martial arts styles was pushed this to its believable limit) and the ""showdown"" which i hope doesn't give too much away was great to watch.

Just another Greek legend falls apart at the hands of Americans,"It's not the first, and i m pretty sure it won't be the last time we find ourselves into the unfavorable condition to watch great ancient Greek legends and myths (such as war in Troy this time) being totally destroyed in the hands of American writers and directors who surely possess NO KNOWLEDGE of Greek history! It appears once more that in the altar of entertainment (shock and awe rings a bell?) nearly all vital characteristics that made this legend unique throughout centuries where sacrificed. For example...Achilles was already dead when greeks invaded troy (but when Brad Pitt is the main actor you can't kill him whenever Hommer-author of Iliad- wanted him dead. Or what can we say about the Total Absence of Gods?? Achilles was semi-god himself and Gods such as Athens or Zeus played a vital role more than once. But with the elimination of gods all this war (that lasted 10 years not 10 days) becomes naive and meaningless. And last but not least Troy was established at the shores of Minor Asia in what is Now Turkey. It's pretty impossible to watch the sun rise from the sea as we watch in plenty of ""epic"" scenes as Troy outlooks the west!!!! Show some Mercy!

My short opinion,"I went to the cinema's with the expectation Troy would at least as good as Gladiator, as some Dutch newspapers said. On the outside this film looks better, but when you pierce through the looks, you have to recognize that the film fails dramaticly to compete with an instant classic like Gladiator.Let me start with the positive things. Troy is truly a cinema-movie: the battles (there are lots of them, since this movie is only about the war @ Troy), 1on1 fights and actions sequences are great. The settings are marvelous too. The costumes, locations and effects really let you be a part of the action. The actors are really fighting themselves and some scenes really take your breath away. Extra thumbs for the message of the film: there are no winners in war and some things are inevitable (excuse me for my bad English; had some drinks :P).Now the points where the director fails: no really interesting dialogue, absence of emotion, and a missed change to intwine a romantic love story with old school epic action.Even the top-actors in the film couldn't prevent the emotional scenes from being dull. The director showed us he can film great action sequences (Das Boot, Perfect Storm), but he doesn't know what to do with the dialogues at all. The romantic scenes between Achilles and his Troyan girlfriend could have formed a nice second storyline, but instead they look roughly cut in the rest of the film. The lines said between the action scenes make you scratch your head and awake deja-vu feelings from The Matrix Revolutions: great action interrupted by inapprehensible philosophical sentences. But where you can unravel some deeper meenings out of the lines of that film, Troy only cites them superficially. Another thing: Orlando Bloom again proves he has no acting talent at all. In fact, the whole audience laughed at him when he was making his 'I'm so sad and lonely and I'm so surprised cuz a monkey jumped into my boot' face. FOR THE TENTH TIME. The model who plays Helena doesn't seem to have any emotion at all. I've seen Brad Pitt play much more exciting roles, but maybe he's trying to show the desperate proudness of Achilles. Then again, the real GOOD actors like Bean, Bana and Brian Cox do a fine job bringing to live Odysseus the Robert the Bruce of Troy, Hector the hero and Agamemnon the bad guy.So the movie lacks emotional weight and certainly DOESN'T allow you to feel banded with a character (like we sympathized with Maximus' fight against the cruel emperor). It isn't as bad as the instant action carnival of Van Helsing. Instead, it brings decent entertainment to the big screen, and it is a nice beginning of a night out. That probably will be the future for other legends and myths (Hannibal, Alexander, King Arthur)...",6.0,Anonymous,History

The cast of actors are from the best I've seen in a movie: Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom and Many more that are fantastic. The costume design was perfect and accurate, the score is beautiful, the set decoration was amazing although for a movie like this I imagine the production used CGI and green screen so I hope they also managed to create an accurate look of troy without any computers. Because the story is so familiar with people the movie gives us a perfect narrative of start to finish. If you know the story of Troy so you know how it will end. Too bad tough that Hollywood doesn't make movies like these anymore, but anyway who on the other hand is asking for a remake???",7.0,Anonymous,History
Troy,Troy was a great movie i really enjoyed watching all the action and drama was great. I truly enjoy watching films that deal with history or at least what had supposedly happened in troy. Achillies is my favorite character in this movie as well as in all of Greek mythology he was a cocky guy very fun to watch. Imortatality is one thing everyone wants and Achillies had except for that little detail he could not get hit on his heal. This is a story i wish could had really happened and sometime i do wish i was there to see it and experience the thrill of being part of history. Troy was a film many people enjoy and i think Hollywood needs to make a lot more films like this and on Greek Mythology.,10.0,Anonymous,History
"wobbly start, but impressive ending","As I had already studied the myth of Troy in Latin, I was very eager to see what Petersen was going to do with the myth of myths: was he going to leave some parts out or would he stick to the original story, even if that meant putting some stuff in that wasn't very credible? Petersen obviously decided against the latter, keeping the movie within the boundaries of the possible.At first I was a bit disappointed though, cause the fighting scenes were amusing rather than breathtaking (the bit where Paris crawled towards Hector and clutched his leg during a man-to-man fight with Menelaos was hilarious), but as the story evolved and the characters developed, I started to get really intrigued by their struggle for love, life or plain honour.The second half is obviously exceedingly better than the first one: only then do you get the feeling of really being pulled into the story. The impressive finale makes you shiver and leaves you with a feeling that you wouldn't have missed this movie. The last voice-over by Odysseus is the perfect end to the greatest adventure of this year's cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Ostentatious Garbage,"This is an epic picture. There isn't a moment in this movie where the director, actors, writer or the musical score let you forget it. Sadly, it a very poor epic. The dialog is pretentious posturing and war-mongering. Many times in the movie, our great, god-like hero, Brad Pitt, speaks and the crowd cheers. Utter garbage.There are wholly implausible moments in a movie that is attempting a very realistic presentation. There is a scene where Brad Pitt lops the head off a gold-plated, stone (or perhaps solid gold) statue like it was made of butter. This can work in a movie that is a fantasy or supernatural epic, but it was inconsistent with the timbre of this movie.The acting from very good actors is consistently bad. I like Brad Pitt. He is an exceptionally talented actor (just see ""12 Monkeys"" for proof of that). This movie made him look like a pretty-boy B movie actor, which he worked so hard to avoid early in his career.The director of this movie, Wolfgang Peterson, has to take the blame for this. He failed to execute on a very good, well-known story. Even the score of this movie was pompous and intrusive. There is nothing redeeming about this movie. The best part is the special effects, but that is no where close to being sufficient to save this dog.",3.0,Anonymous,History
What you would expect from Hollywood,"As a Greek, I've been taught many times our ancient literature. Yes this movie has plenty of inaccuracies, omissions and alterations compared to the original. But so what, Homer was NOT an historian, in fact ""Homer"" most probably was an imaginary name given to a pleiad of people that crafted this story throughout the centuries. Nobody claimed after all this to be Iliad. And you know what, if you stop playing ""spot the inaccuracy"", this movie is actually enjoyable! It felt great to have all these war time heroes of my childhood on the silver screen! Spare the cheesy dialogues and love stories (both Hollywood compulsory), the characters were pretty accurate in their behaviours. This was what I had in mind for most of them. What I didn't like was the active effort to capitalise on the Lord Of the Rings success (by means of same graphics, same battle sounds, same battle choreography, even same actors). Let me finish by saying that this movie have received too much unjust criticism. It is just a movie, for Zeus sake!",8.0,Anonymous,History
cried more tears than Niagra Falls.,"I loved and hated this film.I insisted on going to see it, getting the stunning Orlando Bloom and Brad Pitt in the same film just doesn't happen often enough to miss.It was an extremely bad idea though as I hate war and fighting and the 2 gorgeous guys where fighting for different sides.The woman sitting infront of me in the cinema kept turning round and eventually got up and left because of my constant sobbing and hiccuping.It didn't matter what happened I cried.Brad winning= bad. Orli winning= bad. And Orli just had to play the big sissy, didn't he? He couldn't have played the bold Hector ,noooo, he played the vermin crawling on the ground grabbing for the bold Hector's leg!Apart from being disappointed in the whole fighting and dying storyline ( I know this was unavoidable as it really happened ) I thought the film was good........ god I lie soo much. I love Orlando Bloom and a bit of Brad Pitt never did anyone any harm. mmm mmm mmm.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Sean Bean Rocks!,"Troy was billed as a great epic and as far as battles and CG is was quite epic like. But Brad Pitt is such a mega disappointment that it makes the viewing a little painful at times. I am a fan of Pitt in the sort of roles he had in Twelve Monkeys, Fight Club and Oceans 11/12. But he was wooden and emotionless, and sorry to say his line delivery was amateurish. Orlando Bloom played the worst role of his career (yes even more so than the Calcium Kid) Paris would have been an awful part for a lot of people but Blooms performance was at times embarrassing. But having said all that, Sean Bean was fantastic! He goes from strength to strength and I think in LOTR and Troy he managed to find his greatest genre!",6.0,Anonymous,History
Good overall but a few weak points.,"Troy is a film adaptation of the Ilaid the famous poem that Homer wrote about Achilles dying by Paris' hands and so forth. The movie itself was not bad, but I thought the plot in someways were stale. I wish that it could have focused more on Agamemon (played by Brain Cox) who was trying to take over Troy to rule all of Greece. Instead the plot itself, was staled for the simple reason that Paris took Helen from Agamemon's brother. I thought this killed the whole meaning of the war itself. I was glad however that the tension between Agamemon and his mischievous yet most elite soldier Achilles both on their own personal quests for power and glory, was present to counteract the sappy garbage that was going on.On to the positive's:Brian Cox was perfect as the ruthless Agamemon. He really brings out what he is trying to accomplish and sticks to that goal. Another great bad guy performance by this well versatile actor.After his plunk in the Hulk, Eric Bana has really brought himself out of the gutter as Prince Hector. His presence and determination to keep his city safe was well presented by Bana. I think this movie really brought himself out of the deep end.I always get angry about this. Sean Bean was great as Odyssesus. I just wish the directors would do more with him in his good guy roles. He is another well rounded actor and it bothered me that he wasn't in it enough.Once again Brad Pitt only chooses a role that he knows that he is capable of pulling off, and as Achilles he does an excellent job. I have always respected Pitt because he knows his limits and doesn't try to make himself anymore than what he knows he can do.NOW THE BAD STUFF:I have said it before, I will say it again. Orlando Bloom is not as talented as all the girls think. He was terrible in this film. He can't even pretend to be naive for about 10 minutes. The only thing he did that was credible was shoot a bow and arrow and he has already done that in L.O.T.R. I still believe that Bloom can evolve from his arrow shooting ways. I haven't given up on him yet, but if he doesn't improve within the next 5 years then he'll never be good in my eyes.Diane Kruger did absolutely nothing in this movie. As Helen she was more of a statue that you would put on a trophy than a helpless woman. I think she is a great actress but she presented nothing in this movie.The rest of the acting was pretty poor too. Even Peter O'Toole did not really strike anything interesting to me. Looked to me like they just added extra's in to prevent doing anymore work.Overall I give this movie a 6 out of 10. The battle scenes were excellent in this movie. I just wish we could have seen more of a conflict between Agamemon and Achilles. What could have happened was Achilles could have grown somewhat of a conscience and realize that there was more to glory then winning a war. I dunno it was just an idea.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Strangely flat and unemotional movie with one redeeming quality - Eric Bana,"For one of the greatest stories ever told, and a movie that had all the right pieces - great cast, incredible locations, wonderful story and loads of money - this was a strangely flat and underwhelming enterprise.Brad Pitt seemed uninspired, even disinterested at times, Orly is only slightly less culpable, but only because he obviously is not experienced or mature enough of a thespian for deep, dramatic roles yet, and Diane Kruger is a casting disaster the size of Titanic. Yeah, she's a pretty girl, but I'm sure Hollywood is full of pretty girls who CAN act.Although considering what silliness they were all forced to utter by the scriptwriter(s), one can be quite forgiving.I won't even start with the up-and-down directing and the shameless exploitation of the hunk factor (but c'mon, do the Hollywood producers really think we are THAT interested in Brad's naked behind?! the man could barely keep his pants on the entire movie!)Still, despite all that - and that is the biggest surprise here - this is hardly a bad movie. Even despite bouts of laughter during what were supposed to be dramatic scenes (and a few derogatory audience comments regarding Orly's matchstick legs), the fact that women in the movie are basically window-dressing without three brain cells between them, and ridiculously silly and out-of-place dialogue. Why? Three reasons, really.One - Eric Bana. Sure, he was lost as the Hulk, so much so that I was beginning to wonder if he were the same guy from Chopper and Black Hawk Down, but he more than made up for it with his thoughtful and insightful portrayal of Hector, the man who knows love, honor and sacrifice. Not only did he steal this movie, he slam-dunked it!Two - THE fight scene. Yes, I'm talking the Hector-Achilles duel to the death. That was one excellent piece of movie-making, and all praises go to Bana and Pitt who did it all by themselves, no stunt doubles.Three - the Peter O'Toole moment. The only really touching and spot-on dramatic moment in the entire 163 minute movie - King Priam begging the arrogant warrior who had just killed his son and disrespected his body to give it back for a proper funeral. You gotta give the man who can utter such a sappy line as ""I loved my son from the moment he opened his eyes till the moment you closed them"" with such conviction and heartache all the credit he fully deserves.Now, if only those three things were enough. Alas, for this viewer they were not, and I left the theater thinking ""where is a director with passion and vision of Peter Jackson when you really need him?"" Sad, but true.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Please kill me Achilles!,"If you crap into a 200 million dollar box, you still have crap inside! I love historical epics (braveheart, gladiator, and rob Roy), I love epics in general (lord of the rings trilogy), but this movie doesn't even deserve to be ranked with any of these. Its boring, poorly acted (my goodness, Brad Pitt is so bad in this movie its painful), and just bad. Oh, Helen of Troy is only average looking at best, I couldn't imagine her face sinking a thousand ships. Orlando Bloom's character is very gay, his brother Hector (Eric Bana) is a unconvincing war veteran and acted about as good as he did in Hulk (blah!)

Great Film. BANA was FANTASTIC!,"I was one of those people who had been eagerly anticipating the release of Troy for many many months and I thought that I would thoroughly enjoy it, and for the most I did. To be honest, the screenplay wasn't totally true to the original tale but hey, how many people are really gonna have read the Iliad? It was a very good adaption, very 'edge-of-the-seat' stuff there. The war, though long, was extremely exciting, though not for the faint hearted. I had never seen anyone get their throat sliced so graphically before I saw it, but some very good choreography there. The fight between Hector and Achilles is probably writing itself into cinematic history. It was superb and very emotional. Bana's performance gave me a huge lump in my throat. The costuming is very good, Bob Ringwood did a top job with that. The music was a bit disappointing though. It was quite monotonous and not exciting enough.Now the more important aspects, however, it wasn't, surprisingly, the main cast members that did the most fantastic jobs. Brad Pitt made a good Achilles and I think the arrogance made a very nice touch to the character. Brian Cox was a superbly evil Agamemnon, I was sitting through most of the film wanting to spear the guy! I was though, very disappointed with Orlando Bloom. He doesn't seem to be getting any roles in which he doesn't play a softly spoken, lovelorn wimp and it really would be great if someone could give him a role which doesn't give him this stereotype and doesn't focus solely on his ability to fire arrows.The supporting cast were absolutely fantastic. Peter O'Toole as Priam, Sean Bean as Odysseus, Rose Byrne as Briseis (who I actually think is the more beautiful) and Garrett Hedlund as Patroclus. Great acting there from them all. Now I come to my last few points. Although her role was very small Saffron Burrows was super. She played Andromache, wife of Hector and she really showed off her ability to totally capture the audiences attention.And of course Eric Bana as Hector. He absolutely made the film for me. He was nothing less that totally fantastic. You could tell that he put his all into his role and he created such emotion within it. I can do nothing else but rave about his performance. Definitely the star of the show and if he continues to act like that, even with his policy of 'one movie a year' then he's going to get himself written down as one of the greats.",,Anonymous,History
Which side do you take?,"You can feel both the Troy and the Achilles, and both are being in the opposit side make it universally sad by the end of the movie. If every historical movie would be historical accurate then who would make movies that is intriguing because of the creativ imagination of the movie makers?. And indeed such 'inaccurate' movies that will drive people's curiosity about the historical events, that they by the help of the one click can get quick access to a short summary of the history. Unions, wars, love and grief. These are all interconnected state of events in a particluar appropriate context. And that context is well portrayed in this movie. So far, this is the most 'love drammatic' story ever since the Kleopatra. Bradd Pitt was just meant to be Achilles, at one point his majestic look makes you convince that, that how legendary mythical Archilles looked like, he also pretty much look alike a streotypical handsome greek person from the sculptors, paintings that Romans have heritaged. My rate is 7/10. The story is very well blended but somewhat missing, the smooth long myhtical transition between the major events.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Forget the book and enjoy the movie,"Remember the words ""Inspired by the Iliad"" These words appear at the end of this picture and I emphasize INSPIRED!! I have been a huge fan of epic poems since I could read and the Iliad is by all means a masterpiece bordering perfection.After learning of ""Troy's"" production I began thinking how could they make a movie based on this book without making it ten hours long and having the actors provide HUGE AMOUNTS DIALOGUE!! The answer is you can't. You can have a movie BASED on one of the greatest wars in the history of mankind, you can have a ruthless king, a powerful warrior, a loving prince, and two ""lovers"" who were spoiled beyond control, and still really enjoy yourself.So I urge viewers to please not listen to those that are disgusted that the movie is not loyal to the book, because truth be known if they had gone completely loyal (which is almost impossible) it would have come off as very boring, and very confusing.The MOVIE ""Troy"" is a great MOVIEThe BOOK ""The Iliad"" is a great BOOK do not get them confused",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Sprawling Greek Epic,"I must admit my surprise. I hadn't seen this film in quite some time, and I remember thinking it was an okay movie when I was younger, but I thoroughly enjoyed this rewatch.From the music to the masterful use of practical effects, the scale, feel, and tone of the film were all reminiscent of other epics like Ben-Hur and The Ten Commandments.Apart from the fantastic visuals, this film is held up by an amazing star-studded cast. With heavy hitters like Brad Pitt, Brian Cox, Brendan Gleeson, Diane Kruger, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, Sean Bean, and Peter O'Toole, there's no lack of talent here.However, this film is not perfect. From time to time, I found the writing to be weak, which overall affected the storytelling, making certain moments sluggish. Having said that, I was never bored despite the film's 3-hour and 16-minute runtime.Lastly, while I find Diane Kruger to be a fantastic actress, and I think she did a marvelous job portraying the beautiful Helen of Troy, she does occasionally struggle with keeping her accent hidden. This is nothing more than a nitpick, though, and doesn't affect my overall score.Nonetheless, I enjoyed every minute of the film, and after all this time, it felt as if I rediscovered it. Viewing the Director's Cut brought a fresh perspective, making it seem like I was watching the movie for the first time. Now, I am very interested in revisiting the Theatrical Cut and comparing the two.Overall, I found Troy to be a well-above-average film and a breath of fresh air after my recent disappointment with Immortals. It also achieves something that I find is almost completely lost in modern filmmaking (Hollywood), which is the dedication to storytelling and the deliberate pacing of taking one's time.Final Score: 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Not for serious cinephiles,"Oh dear, where do I start with this one? I watched it yesterday and it was so bad, its producers should pay viewers to sit down and fill the theaters.Let's start with how it measures up to Homer's epic. It doesn't. It portrays events in a totally different manner, unrelated to the Iliad.Second, let's go to historical accuracy. It is commonly accepted that the Trojan war happened circa 1200 BC, although the archaeological evidence and the astronomical information given by Homer point to about two thousand years earlier.During those times, Greece's cultural phase was the Minoan/Mycenean. The wall paintings in the Minoan and Mycenean palaces and the archaeological findings show us exactly what armor, shields and weaponry were used back then by Greeks. Instead, in the film we see slightly modified versions of weaponry of the Classical period. The same goes with naval vessels. Myceneans, Spartans, Minoans etc. did NOT have triremes. But I digress... Hollywood isn't about historical accuracy; it's about selling a spectacle, no matter if it's utter trash.Let's go to acting. The only half-decent acting in this film was done by Peter O' Toole; the rest were abysmal.Character descriptions and depictions? That's a laugh.In short, anyone who respects cinema and views it as an ART and not as a shallow pastime for uneducated plebes should avoid this film.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"Simple, yet Large","Fine, so it has been discussed in massive detail how much the movie varies from the book. Suddenly everyone has become literary. But as they said it is ""inspired by"" not ""based on"" or ""adapted from"".Orlando Blooms performance is also bashed. But by the same book lovers. Recall in Homers tale, Paris is a quivering little weakling who was polishing his armour in his bedroom while everyone else was dying outside. Mission accomplished, because by the end I think we all realized just how worthless Paris really was.Eric Bana's performance was fabulous. I didn't really see him as much of an actor in Hulk, but it seems as if he was made for this kind of roll (insert comments from Randy, Simon and ... we can forget Paula here). The strength of Hector was definitely seen (if not his arrogance, but I think that's more in the writing than in his actual acting).Other than that I think the movie was beautifully done. May not have had as much action as the action lovers wanted, nor did it have full romantic developments that the romancers wanted, but I think it was quite fine for people who just love movies and don't need one overwhelming theme. (Do we always need to put movies in a class)(of course a female could not end her review without commenting on the physiques of Bana, Bloom and Pitt ... WOW)4 out of 5 stars",,Anonymous,History
"Great story, visually stunning but cheesy dialogue","I enjoyed Troy. I thought the story was elegantly translated to the big screen. The landscapes and battle scenes were visually stunning, and the CGI was done well enough that you really didn't notice it. The acting was good, especially Peter O'Toole and Brian Cox. I have not been overly impressed with Eric Bana's previous work, but I felt like he did a really good job as Hector. Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom were adequate. The main downside to this movie was that the dialogue was so ridiculously cheesy that it made it very hard to take the movie seriously (even my wife kept giving me the ""gag me"" sign), but this isn't enough of an excuse not to go see it. I would definitely recommend this movie, especially if you like big sweeping epic films with lots of action just try and take the dialogue as comic relief.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Start to searching for the CD immediatelly and if there will be tracks that ought to be on the CD, it would be one of the best Horner´s scores of last years!!! Keeping fingers crossed for Petersen, Horner, director of Photography Roger Prat, costume designers and others at the academy award ceremony next year :-) Also Eric Bana, Brian Cox and Peter O´Toole would deserve at least nominations for their parts but unfortunately this is not a genre for actor to win an award...

And Brad Pitt...oh my God....from a woman's point of view.....beautiful, just beautiful. While his acting has always been questionable and people feel his looks drive his career, I have found that he can be very diverse. His acting in Twelve Monkeys was incredible....he played that loon perfectly, ditto Interview With A Vampire, Legends of the Fall....I thinks his looks cause many to criticize his acting.....poor Brad, right!...

"An entertaining blockbuster movie of Greek mythology, with stars including Peter O'Toole and a glimpse of Julie Christie","Directed and co-produced by Wolfgang Petersen (German filmmaker of the famous 'Das Boot' 1981 and his last seen picture in 2000 'The Perfect Storm') TROY is an entertaining big-budget Hollywood fare. The first Saturday matinee show of the opening weekend was quite crowded. Audience attention were held. The film was well-paced even though it's 2 hrs. 42 mins. - it didn't feel long. The story was well-scripted for the screen - condensing and adapting from Homer's 'The Iliad' to big screen entertainment is no small fete - kudo's to writer David Benioff who did 'The 25th Hour' 2002. The battle scenes - yes, the immensity and impact felt with the wide angle coverage - CGI, special effects, visual effects notwithstanding - cinematographer Roger Pratt (who's done quite a few projects with filmmaker Terry Gilliam) delivered effectively, along with score by James Horner at a slightly different tempo here (quite a bit of sweltering notes and trumpets for the period) 'twas good to employ Greek songs aptly mournful in tone to match story progression - there were four funeral rituals respectfully depicted on screen.There's plenty of online information to be found on Homer, Trojan War, Achilles and as much Greek Mythology as you can take. It seems there's quite a backstory on Achilles' mother Thetis, portrayed briefly by Julie Christie, who has prophetic power, indeed (even Zeus feared her). The scene with Peter O'Toole as King Priam meeting Brad Pitt's Achilles was a memorable one by the lines spoken. A tender scene is when Hector (a steady performance from Eric ""HULK"" Bana), on the night before fighting Achilles, telling his wife Andromache (played by lovely Saffron Burrows) how to save her and their son from the invading Achaean Greeks. The voices of Brian Cox (as King Agamemnon) and Brendan Gleeson (as Menelaus, husband of Helen) were unmistakable even under the heavy garb and beards. ""Lord of the Rings"" fans would be happy to see Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean in action here. The movie could have been called ""Achilles"" as the story is centered around Brad Pitt's role, but ""TROY"" does sound more assuring as a movie title.Saw the cable History Channel's ""True Story of Troy"" and remembered I've seen the site of Troy when I was in Turkey (1996). It is considered one of the tourist spots for European tours of Turkey by Canakkale and you get to see the legendary Trojan Wooden Horse. Hearing about the excavation history and the archaeologists, literary detectives and military analysts talk about the Trojan War and Homer's poems - yes, like any documentary, these may be mere sound bites and edited images that could be taken out of context, nevertheless, it was interesting to view the TV episode. Perhaps more insightful a documentary on war and the facts and thinking behind war strategy is the honestly worthy Oscar winner, Errol (The Thin Blue Line) Morris' ""The Fog of War,"" where former Secretary of Defense Robert S.(Strange) McNamara is featured talking, reflecting, contemplating about the effects of war. Another fascinating talking head documentary is by filmmakers André Heller and Othmar Schmiderer, ""Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary,"" featuring Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge, who described her experiences during the last days with Hitler.It's been a while since we get to see an epic Greek myth on screen, and ""TROY"" is as good a chance as any.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Homer would be pleased!,"The film Troy directed by Wolfgang Peterson is not the first film to depict Homer's Iliad; however, it is uniquely fused with an all-star cast and technologically balanced with Computer Engineering. Roger Pratt has captured the texture of the story with his brilliant cinematography and Peter Honess's editing allows the audience to become one with the ultimate power thrusting strength of Achilles. I must say, ""well done Brian Cox on your performance as Agamemnon. You are truly a master when it comes to living the villain."" Brian Cox is both vile and manipulative as well as creative when it comes to conquering the Aegean Sea. Peter O'Toole's portrayal of Priam is sound. I could sense the tension between his loss of a child and his overwhelming display of trust for tradition. I was not impressed with Orlando Blooms performance, although Paris is a sappy lover and fullish youth I felt lost at times with his character. This was probably Eric Bana's best performance, Hector the hero and martyr. Bana's presence on the screen was definitely a plus. Brad Pitt's character seemed detached from reality and perhaps in the celestial realm? Powerful energy. Mythic. Brutal ballistic strength. Sean Bean was a perfect Odysseus. Vibrant, humorous, and supportive. Finally, I must say that the use of computer graphics in the film was not overdone. One of my favorite scenes in this film exists solely on the wonders of technology. (See the movie). The Director's choice of ending the film the way it was done allowed the audience to witness myth in the making. This epic thriller is a must see for those who like being entertained and falling into the sequence of action.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Epic, but far from Homer...","CGI gets its hands on The Iliad, in Wolfgang Peterson's long sword and sandal epic and propels into - and for - 21st century audiences.It's not as much as a mess as it could have been, and while there are some dodgy castings and a varying level of acting success, it generally is a well-made (especially the battles scenes, both the one-on-one and large scale), has some interesting and nice looking people playing them and are quite watchable, thankyou.Brad Pitt's (as Achilles) physique has never been leaner (on camera, I wouldn't know otherwise!) and a nice load of leading actors generally make decent characters out of their roles. Julie Christie and Peter O'Toole add their seasoned wisdom, Eric Bana, like Pitt, looks the part to a tee and even Orlando Bloom, who is often miscast as someone more macho than he can play, is fine as the pretty-boy lover of Diane Kruger.Kruger is Helen, Queen of Sparta, whose affections get stolen from husband, Menelaus, played by Brendon Gleeson. Brian Cox, as Agamemnon is easily robust enough for his part as the leader of the Greek armies. Bana, as Hector is leader of the Trojans.I wouldn't worry too much as to the actual history (I didn't), if you don't want to as it's nice to just let the actors do their bits and the action unfold. The story does get a bit ponderous and slow at times but then along comes another exciting bit.Generally, I don't think too many people have a real problem with 'Troy' and whilst it can't quite reach 'classic' status, or being truly great, it does a good job of entertaining us.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"""Troy"" is Good, Epic Entertainment","I enjoyed ""Troy"" immensely. It had a great cast, some awesome fight sequences and wonderful cinematography. It may not be accurate to the original story, but who freakin cares. This film is not supposed to be a history lesson but an interpretation of the story of the Trojan War. I liked the film anyway. I saw the film for the first time on Friday with some of my friends and thought it was pretty darn good. I did have a few problems with the film, especially the score by James Horner. He has written some wonderful scores for such films as Braveheart, Apollo 13 and Titanic but this score did not have one piece of really memorable music in it. The score seemed to be recycled from other films especially Gladiator in a few spots. It wasn't the worst score ever, but I wish it had been better. I saw the film again on Saturday with my mom and I liked it a lot better the second time for some strange reason. Things that bothered me when I first saw it didn't bother me so much anymore and I looked at the film for what it was; a good old fashioned time at the movies. The second time I saw it I payed more attention to the acting in the film. I loved the performances in this movie, especially Eric Bana, Brad Pitt and most of all Peter O'Toole. Eric Bana gives a compelling, believable performance as Hector and really shows his great skills as an actor. I hope to see him in a lot more films in the future. Brad Pitt, one of the most underrated actors in my opinion dominates as Achilles. the critics can say what they want about him being just a pretty face, but I though he was awesome in this film. It really shows that he worked hard for this role and he does a magnificent job of playing the conflicted warrior. Finally, Peter O'Toole, what can be said about him that hasn't already been said a hundred times. He is just GREAT! One of the finest actors to ever grace the screen and he deserves an Oscar nomination for his role in this film. He delivers one of the best scenes, and the most well acted scene, in the entire film which includes his character King Priam begging Achilles for his son back. What a great scene! Anyway, one thing that surprised me about ""Troy"" was the fact that the one on one fight scenes between characters were more exciting and well done than the larger scaled battle sequences containing thousands of soldiers. I guess the reason for that is that it is easier to see who is fighting whom in the smaller fight scenes. The fight between Paris (Orlando Bloom) and Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson) is very good and the fight between Achilles and Hector is movie making at its best. What a terrifically well done scene (this was one of the only parts of the score I liked). In conclusion, this is a really good film with some terrific scenes and acting. It may be three hours, but for me the time flew by. GO SEE IT!",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Not excellent, but good enough","The movie is helped by a beautiful story which mixes love, brotherhood, ambition, and a whole set of emotions which keep you hooked during most part of it.

I haven't read the Iliad, but it made me want to do it now, and people who have both watched the movie and read the book agree that is a o.k condensation, and as many people say, it would be almost impossible to make everything the story tells in such amount of time.Definitely if you want to watch a good movie and keep entertained for 2 hours and a half, go for it.",7.0,Anonymous,History
No Glory in Troy,"I just saw this film at a screening and must say that it is one of the worst films I have seen in awhile.  I was looking forward to seeing this film, but now I have to advise you not to waste your money on it.  It's horrible in so many aspects. First, they COMPLETELY BUTCHER the story of the Iliad and in so many ways.  Iwon't reveal how so as not to spoil anything, but a lot of important elements are gone or significantly altered for the worst.  The dialogue and directing are also incredibly bad.  You feel like you're watching a melodrama rather than an epic war.  There is little, if none, development of the characters, and many of them seem to have a Post-WWI and aetheist view on life.Please, Please, Please do not pay to see this movie.  If it looks interesting to you at all, pick up Homer's poem and use your imagination for the rest.  They include a quick reference to the Aeneid, meaning there could be a sequel if this does well enough.  I pray to Zeus that doesn't happen.",1.0,Anonymous,History
No film is perfect...,"Troy being no exception. However, it is not as bad as some would have you believe.A retelling of the Trojan war, Troy features superb special effects and an excellent cast.For me, the best performance is by Eric Bana as Hector. Bana succeeds tremendously in portraying the sheer bravery of Hector, and you understand why everyone in Troy loves him!Brad Pitt's Achilles is also a very good performance. Diane Kruger doesn't really have much to work with to give Helen some character. A dull character in this film, Kruger does her best.Orlando Bloom's performance is good. Nothing spectacular, but again he is not given a very (in my opinion) interesting character to work with.This is obviously not true to the Iliad completely, but lets face it, that wouldn't work in Hollywood now, would it?Overall a 8/10",,Anonymous,History
Brad Pitts Abs Anyone?,"Troy, 2004's biggest blockbuster (well, so far, anyway) is a swords and sandals epic based on Homer's The Illiad.  The Greek hero Achilles (Brad Pitt) is centre stage in story of the Trojan War, one of the largest ever fought.Paris (Orlando Bloom), the second son of Priam (Peter O'Toole), King of Troy, has a certain way with the ladies (due to a previous encounter with Aphrodite), and falls in love with Helen, the wife of Menelaus, King of Sparta, a Greek city-state.  After stealing his newfound love back to Troy, the Greek armies all rally under King Agamemnon (Brian Cox), who has been looking for an excuse to sack Troy for some time.  Achilles, who is the greatest fighter in the Greek empire, grudgingly follows Agamemnon, to fight for the Greek people, and to ensure his name lives on throughout the Ages.The film runs for just over 160 minutes, and it's a good thing it does; Ittook somewhere between 40 minutes and an hour to get over the cheesy acting and close-ups that are thrown at us.  From the opening dialogue (which seems to be a continuation of Maximus' ""echoes through eternity"" speech from Gladiator), we are given our first hint that this is no character driven drama - it's a swords and sandals Blockbuster!  When a character is upset, we will be advised as much courtesy of an extreme close-up involving a hammed-up grimace, so don't worry, you can leave your brain at the door.Of course, this is not entirely a bad thing.  The ladies will certainly have something to keep them entertained - Brad Pitt has been working out even more than usual, and even Legolas' wiry frame has been beefed up to us with a lovely six pack.  The action is very well choreographed, and any computer-generated imagery is handled brilliantly, blending in with the action seamlessly.  The plot doesn't lag for more than a second, and did I mention. the swords and sandals?I was pleasantly surprised by the darkness of the film as well.  We see that the war could have been prevented on many occasions, but for greed and pride, and our hero's flaws are made public knowledge.  Achilles' himself is an egotistical hothead, who seems to almost enjoy exercising his power to kill people that cross him, while Paris is a cloudy headed romantic fool. Eric Bana turns in a great performance as the films good guy, Prince Hector, hero of the Trojan Army, and it was great to see fellow Aussie Rose Byrne playing Briseis (though I can't say I remember her from the adaptations I read as a child?), who holds her own in (and out of) the sack with Brad Pitt.It was great to see all the Greek heroes on screen, including my old favorite Odysseus (Sean Bean), and though war didn't seem to last the 10 years it should have (it was more like a few weeks at most), this film makes for quite an enjoyable experience.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
A sweeping Epic Adventure,"There are lots of things that are really good about ""Troy"". 1st of all Brad Pitt is amazing, he has the charisma and the macho looks, and he is without any doubt played the role of Achilles very well. Eric Bana also shines as Hector, his facial Expressions are extraordinary, they show his feelings clearly without the need to speak.The Battle scenes are exciting and grand, maybe not as good as those in the lord of the rings, but at least they are realistic. The one on one fights scenes are extraordinary, they are the best fight scenes that i have seen ever.Orlando Bloom simply is not up for the his role as Prince Paris, actually he is laughable. The screenplay wasn't very good, it should have been better, but the real disappointment was The score composed by James Horner. The music in the trailer was composed by Gabriel Yared (The English Patient,The Talented Mr.Ripley, and Cold Mountain)and it was simply great, but the makers decided to get James Horner instead for unknown reasons, and they payed the price now because the music is simply very bad.

"An Epic, Almost...","This is an OK film.It's shame that the director, Wolfgang Petersen, seemed to over concentrate on the big ticket items and ignored the details that could have made the film a true masterpiece. The dialogues are not period. It would probably be much better if Mr. Petersen had the actors speak in ancient Greek. The battle scenes lack the intensity of those in 'Braveheart' and 'Gladiator'. It is already an R-rated movie; I don't understand what was holding Mr. Petersen back.In addition, although Mr. Pertersen mentioned to the press that he intended to put together a beautiful ensemble of cast, I believe that casting Orlando Bloom as Paris is a mistake. So is casting Diane Kruger as Helen. There is little chemistry between Orlando and Kruger. Bloom looks more like a valet in the movie. And, although Ms. Kruger is a very pretty person, she looks more like a fancy urban woman than the cause of the greatest war the world has ever seen. As for Brad Pitt, I found his performance lacking certain depth. In the scene where he, as Achilles, is standing outside of Troy calling Hector for a fight, he looks more like he is p***ed off than occupied with extreme anger. When he was wrapping up Hector's body for returning to Priam, king of Troy, he failed to convey a frustration stemmed from conflicting beliefs and to show that he is sadden and humbled by the ultimate devastation. I wish that his performance is as good as that in 'Legends of the Fall (1994).' However, I have to mention that the performance of Brian Cox and Peter O'Toole is generally good.All in all, this is an OK film, but I believe it will probably soon be forgotten, despite its high budget and its cast.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Not the Illiad--Based upon it.,"This is a stand-alone movie with its own theme(s) based upon the story told by the Iliad. It is not the Iliad. Does not try to be nor does it remotely even attempt to pretend to be. It has its own stories. And they are great stories well told with great characters.I thought the movie was awesome and Pitt and the character of Achilles was that of an incredibly complex man of depth--as was Hector. The very first thing that strikes you about the movie from the beginning and continues throughout is the incredible intelligent dialog with no chitchat. Pitt was extraordinarily believable as the most skilled awesome invincible warrior you would ever want to meet. The guy was buffed in the lean athletic muscular true fighting physique of such a character. Just think of the build of a six foot tall Sugar Ray Leonard in peak fighting condition. Then there was his Terminator mentality. Pitt's Achilles was absolutely the last person in the world you wanted coming at you. Even Hector, the great fearless warrior, and great and honorable man that he was recognized this. (Eric Bana was superb as Hector.) This movie actually is too subtlety intelligent in its dialog and subplots and themes for average filmgoers. I was amazed. It was nothing like what I suspected it would be. It shows even the subtle looks between major characters as they listen to political BS between Kings and princes.The conversation between Achilles and Priam who comes to Achilles to beg for the body of his son Hector is sufficient to bring a lump in the throat of any mature person. One of the great scenes in the movie! So well written, directed and acted. A very powerful and deep moment about the deepest of emotions without being OT or melodramatic! Men fight for honor, pride, love, country, friends, greed, and power. This film shows all of those motives and the characters behind them. And it shows them IN DEPTH! Yes, everyone you know from the Iliad is there but they don't all meet the same fate as described in the classic. As I said this movie does not pretend to be telling the Iliad. This is ""Based on a true story"" type of movie.The fight between Achilles and Hector is one of the finest, most original, beautiful and believable choreographed fights I have ever seen--all done without any stunt doubles or tricks. The fight is even more dramatic because of the meaning of the fight and why they fight and how that has been conveyed to the viewer in the telling of the story up to that point. And you don't want either to die.A very ""adult"" film in the very best sense of the word! The special effects are amazing in the battle scenes and maneuvers of the armies. They put LOTR to shame as far as size COMBINED with authenticity and LOTR was not exactly chopped liver in that arena. There is not a hint of phoniness or ""special effects"" to be detected.But for me the heart of this excellent movie is the dialog and the depth of the characters complimented by outstanding performances. So many conflicts of human frailties here! The movie is in the best sense of the word a true spectacle--but for adults with a soul! It isn't an action movie. No this is very much a drama with a lot of action.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Fantastic action, good acting with an ok script","Troy's fight scenes are brilliant, it's an exciting film and deserves huge credit for it. Now, I didn't watch the extended edition which may well be better than the theatrical but the script really wasn't that great, the acting is good enough and whilst it could have been better it's fine for a big budget flick, but the dialogue is not hugely memorable and camera work whilst being brilliant in the battle scenes never really goes anywhere when all the cast isn't hacking away at each other.7/10: Boasts big stars with epic action sequences whilst being dragged down by an average script, all in all a great film worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Don't expect the Iliad,"If you are expecting the epic story in the Iliad, you may be disappointed. I enjoyed this film because it was more like a ""what could really have happened"" type of adaptation. To me, that's what made the movie. If you are a big fan of the Iliad, I think you'll enjoy this flick a lot better if you're aware that it's an *adaptation*, not a retelling of the book! It has used the IDEAS from the book; the characters, situations, etc. But this movie is loosely based around those ideas to tell its own tale.The movie has its own style for the story of the Trojan war, and in my opinion it tells the story as well as the book, just in a very different way. This can at first be very annoying, and to enjoy the film you have to be willing to accept that the story is its own. The characters will not behave quite as expected, and the feel of the story is totally different.If you haven't read the Iliad, you'll probably like the movie. If you have, you should forget the book for a while and think of the movie as a n unrelated story, then decide afterward whether it was a butchery of the Iliad or a story that can coexist separate from the book.",9.0,Anonymous,History
deja vu?,"Hmm, after a while I sort of expected Golem to appear. But then, good actors are had to find, so you use the decent ones you've discovered over and over. Its been a while since I read the Iliad, but most of the movie  seemed to be more or less faithful to Homer's plot (except, maybe, the ending). I'd particularly like to complement the set designers, those were damn functional yurts on the beach, and I don't recall seeing that many ships assembled before, even in WW II D-Day photos. Also, I liked the way that Petersen developed the viewer's appreciation of how the weaknesses and strengths of the major characters changed over the course of the movie.  At the beginning I pigeonholed Achilles as a bloodthirsty status seeking dork. By the end I realized he was a noble bloodthirsty status seeking dork with a conscience. Helen of Troy's character, though pretty, didn't really ring my chimes at all. very 2- dimensional she was. But, all in all, the whole shebang was worth the price of a ticket.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Troyreffic :),"This movie is an epic, quite simply one of the best history films of the last 50 years. The story is clearly presented by some solid performances notably good from eric banner. Its a love pact that enthralls literally thousands of greeks into a bloody bitter battle telling the story of Troy. Whilst initially it seems a bit hollow the film does hold a lot of emotion that spills into each sequence. A few more fights would have good but alround winner, building tension and excitement in every scene.A lot of people have said that Bradd Pitt was miscast but his natural confidence and screen play is comfortably adapted. Another note about the film is that each shot magically directed to give a realistic impression of the action. Well worth seeing whatever you like.",,Anonymous,History
Not even Homer lite,"The Iliad was not all about Achilles. But this movie is all about Brad Pitt. I am a big fan of Mr. Pitt for many reasons. However, I am a much more avid fan of Homer, whose Iliad has been massacred by this 1950s epic with 21st Century special effects. The sacking of Troy cannot compare to the devastation wrought on Homer's epic poem by this production. ""Lord of the Rings"" received far better treatment on all levels. Brian Cox plays Agamemnon with Vaudevillian villainy. Brendon Gleeson takes a better stab at Menelaus, but it is not his finest hour. Orlando Bloom's Paris is prettier than Helen of Troy. And bless the memory of Peter O'Toole, who, despite age and infirmity, gave this movie its only dose of class. In fairness, I should also credit Sean Bean with a somewhat respectable Odysseus. The staged beefcake shots were calendar worthy, I suppose, but even the passion seemed canned and stale. My vote of 6 goes to all the crew and post production folks who did a great job on the look of the film, with the exception of the really bad hair extensions. Why can't someone have the guts and vision to do the Classics with intelligence and respect for both the original brilliance of the stories and the intelligence of an audience? The Iliad could have been done much better with less flash.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Not quite as Homer told it,"Troy is a good movie, the cast does a great job, and the only cheesy line is Achilles' ""Immortality, take it, it's yours!"". But anyone who has read the Illiad, the Odyssey and some history should be disappointed. _SPOILERS_ The movie works well, although it seems a bit hastened, Bana makes a great Hector, Bloom is better playing the weakling Paris than he was in LOTR & Pirates, O'Toole is the best as Priam, and the ladies do well, especially Saffron Burrows as Andromache. Sean Bean was the perfect choice to play the ingenious Odysseus. The weaponry was accordingly fit for the Bronze Age. What was great was how Achilles never bled, and the wound that killed him was the one in the heel, but of course he never saw Troy fell.Take Menelaus, for example, in the original story he is the only one who gets back safely to his kingdom, with Helen by his side; here they kill him early in the war. The pace of the war is frantic, it seems that it only took 1 month for everything to unfold, when it really took 10 years. Many people were left out, like Priam's daughters Cassandra and Polyxena & his sons Deiphobus and Helenus; Achilles' sons Phyrrus & Neoptolemus; great leaders like Nestor and Diomede were reduced to furniture. Then there are the ""cousins"": Patroclus was Achilles' best friend and a good warrior, not his sissy squire; Briseis wasn't royalty, just a farmer's daughter. Ajax commits suicide after Achilles is treacherously killed by Paris, who later is killed by an arrow too. Also Achilles famous armor, made by Vulcan, is reduced to nothing as they decide to showcase Pitt's biceps, anyways Bana was much buffer.In the end is an overall good movie, it just should not be taken as a faithful account of Homer's Trojan War epic. 7 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,History
One that will get mixed reviews,"As it seems so far in other people's comments, Troy is becoming one of those movies that will undoubtedly get mixed reviews. Although, I personally enjoyed the film because I went in with no expectations. It is not the greatest epic ever, nor is it as horrible as some people are making it out to be.Whether or not you're familiar with the Iliad should not stop you from watching this movie. Troy provides many action-filled sequences that are very entertaining, and gives you enough background on the characters to understand what's going on and who's who. Brad Pitt and Eric Bana, I believe, did a great job portraying their powerful characters. Peter O'Toole also stands out in this film as the king everyone comes to love as well as Brian Cox who is the king everyone comes to hate. Although Diane Kruger, Saffron Burrows and Rose Byrne weren't given much dialogue, they do a pretty good job as eye candy for the film and acting as the ""damsels in the distress."" Other than a few corny lines that are tolerable for an action film, the only real disappointment in this movie was Orlando Bloom. He's great to look at, but the delivery of his lines often times were over-dramatic, and his facial expressions laughable.Other than that, it's a fun film. Don't count on complete accuracy to the book, or for the greatest film you've ever seen. It's a summer blockbuster, that's well worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Crowd pleaser,"TROY Pulled this out from the old collection last night. Had never got round to watching it because, to be honest, I wasn't expecting much. Fair to say I was prove right.Another movie based upon the Helen of Troy, Achilles and Trojan Horse stories. For a big budget movie, they cast pretty low budget, with just Brad Pitt (Achilles) and Eric Bana (Hector) in main roles, as well as Rose Byrne and Orlando Bloom in minor roles. The story is pretty well known, so not too many surprises, it was just going to be how the movie looked and played out. The movie holds your interest, although there are a few cringe moments, with some terribly poor or clichéd lines. The actors aren't given much to work with (obviously not much of the budget went towards the screenplay). There's some good action sequences though and a few decent scenes, overall a good movie to watch on a boring night at home.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Okay, Not Epic","Homer's Iliad is an epic which has lasted for millennia, and a film was never going to live up to such grandiosity. However, a film could have imparted the great story for many years if it was done in a remotely representable fashion. I don't think Troy really continues in the memory further than 2004.This is a good opportunity to understand a part of Greek history and some of it's mythology, but this particular epic isn't delivered to the degree it could have been. The decision to remove any trace of Greek/Mediterranean accent is fine, and consistently done in cinema, but to have every character throw up another different American or British accent does take you out of the moment at times. The CGI and cinematic visuals are okay but don't really stand up in present day, particularly when you compare them to the likes of the Lord of the Rings, which was released prior to Troy (and on that comparison, they really milked having Legolas as the archer). Plus, some of the visuals of precision spear throwing are just downright daft.The biggest saving grace for this film is that it had a storyline to follow. Had it followed the original story a little closer, it could have improved itself more so. It's unreasonable to expect a script to follow an ancient poem exactly, but throwing Achilles about the timeline, killing off main characters incorrectly, and portraying a 10 year war as something that started and finished within two weeks is a bit much. Elements truly following the story were interpreted well, and small 'easter eggs' regarding Ancient Greek history gave the film so much more flavour. The true highlight of the film is the choreography of Achilles' and Hector's battle, which is performed very well, and provides the significant memory of the two and a half hours.I don't want constant remakes from Hollywood, but surely this story deserves another chance, where an entire history can be explored across a saga?",6.0,Anonymous,History
Unimpressive and Unemotional,"""Troy"" is the first of many blockbusters in this summer of 2004.  When seeing a summer blockbuster, one must keep in mind several things.  First, don't expect much in the way of acting.  Second, don't expect much in the way of story.  Third, don't really expect much at all.There are exceptions to these rules, but sadly these same rules apply to ""Troy,"" which is simply overrated.  The acting, for the most part, seems void of any real emotion, as the actors seem more bored by the war than excited by it.  The story is preposterous, especially when compared to Homer's ""The Iliad.""  The movie, I believe, would have been much more entertaining if it had stuck to the story instead of making up dramatic ""twists"" that add more melodrama than anything else.  The music by James Horner, did not stir up any emotion either, so I was left unaffected by much of anything that happens in the entire movie.""Troy,"" however, is probably not as dumb as I've led you to believe.  I felt that an excellent performance by Eric Bana as Hector did stand out as better than any of the others.  Also, the cinematography is excellent and the sets look extremely realistic.  The action is also decently choreographed, but still fails to excite because the audience does not care about any of the two-dimensional characters.All in all, a bit better than average, and many are more tolerant of this garbage than I.Final Grade: B-.",5.0,Anonymous,History
A visual Spectacular - Thats all I wanted,"I loved this movie so much! because all i wanted was action-packed visual spectacle not because I wanted and intelligent plot or thought provoking dialogue, Hell no!. I went to see my favorite actors all in one place, Brad Pitt, Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean all together,fighting each other, Great! and Eric Bana is fast becoming a fav of mine, very good looking and his acting really stood out and made the film a little more 'real' for me. I wasn't interested in getting a history lesson either, i gave that up after GCSE because i didn't enjoy it, who wants to learn when Brad Pitt is right there in front of you 12ft high?! And butt naked I might add. :PI go to the movies to be entertained and Troy certainly did that. The fighting scenes were amazing especially the one-on-one between Achillies and Hector (I was routing for both unfortunately, so there were tears welling in my eyes) The costumes were beautiful and so were the actors involved (mostly).After leaving the cinema, my brother, who is a classics student told me the whole story (as written by Homer) from beginning to end and yes there were differences, major differences but i still did learn a little something about classics that i had never known before. If you want to get the untouched version of the Illiad READ it don't go to the cinema expecting to get the visual version what you make up in your head is far more vivid anyway. I think that teenagers my age will leave this film and want to read the actual thing afterwards, i know i do and GOOD it gave them a kick up the butt to get a little culture.People going to see Troy for a intellectual experience will be very disappointed but if you love Brad Pitt and want to see him running around in a skirt this is for you!",,Anonymous,History

I do think that the movie was legitimately well made.Do not see this movie if you are like me and interested in the mythology and interested in seeing it come to life.However, if you really don't care very much about the classics, this movie could end up being right up your alley. Its a fairly normal Hollywood attempt to recreate someone else's work. It does a decent job of documenting the fall of Troy and you might come out enjoying it.

a positive review with some criticism thrown in for interest,"I just came back from the movies- WOW! Troy was the type of movie where you sit in the cinema afterwards for half of the credits, just absorbing what happened! I loved it! I've been looking forward to it soooo much and wasn't disappointed at all.To be honest, at first I wanted to see Troy because of Orlando Bloom. But his part is really over-hyped-up. He comes across as a kid who doesn't care about consequences, and has a fair share up brattyness thrown in for good measure. I suppose that could be called good acting- after all, that's what Paris was, I spose. But Orlando didn't even convince me that he was being driven by love- that the whole movie was an epic based on, and fought for, love. He was kinda stale with Helen(when you consider that his passion for her was Paris's only redeeming character trait) and he didn't register much emotion at all.Helen may have had a part in this- she was a real casting disappointment. I hoped to see a woman who was so beautiful it would convince me that yes, she could provoke a war.(In the original story, Helen is courted by all the princes of Greece, and they all sign a pact to say that if harm ever befalls her, they will go to her rescue. Then, when she is stolen? something like ten years later, they are all obliged to rescue her, although by then none of them really care about her any more, and most are happily married. )So Helen was really pretty boring in the movie. Her character was wishy-washy, she couldn't ever decide on anything, and to top it off she was cast next to Hectors wife(don't know this actresses name either).Hector's wife, I thought was brilliant. She had personality, showed compassion and convinced me of her position. She was the type of person I imagined as Helen.I think Helen would have been better portrayed as either cold, hard and incredibly, impossibly beautiful, or as a strong, courageous and influential leader of women, who used beauty to her advantage.Anyway, moving on. The first third of the movie seemed really removed to me. There was all this fighting, and battle, before we even knew the characters. I suppose it introduced them in a way, especially Achilles- but it dragged the audience through a fair bit of unnecessary gore.Throughout all this, the score really wasn't helping. It was so obvious in parts. The characters are trying to portray emotion, and then the blatant music goes and trumpets the exaggerated emotion in our ears, instead of subtly helping the actor's performance.Now I suppose I'm giving the wrong impression-  I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!!! IT WAS UTTERLY BRILLIANT! It's just I can't write a whole review going ""wonderful, fantastic, genius, masterpiece, superb, stupefying, amazing, brilliant, thrilling, engaging, great, terrific.. you get the point."" BUT HONESTLY, THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT! AND REALLY WORTH SEEING!And yes- I'm coming to the hotness factor! Coz quite frankly, I didn't know which way to look! (I'm a 15 y/o girl) AS I said- I love Orlando- sooooooo utterly hot!!! But in this movie he was upstaged by Brad Pitt. I've never really known about Brad Pitt- he seemed a normal Hollywood pretentious movie-star with a big bank account- and I suppose my opinion hasn't really changed- except now he's a Hollywood pretentious movie-star with a big bank account whose also really incredibly hot! (Plus he is a good actor, I've decided, and contrary to someone else's review, I think he was a great casting choice!)When Achilles was going to fight Hector, it was impossible to chose who I wanted to win. On one hand there was Hector, who is this doting father, a perfect crown-prince with an awesome personality (and on the side not bad-looking), but on the other hand this bad-boy Achilles who, if he dies, will lower the earth's temperature by 6 degrees!! I have to admit that in the end I went for Achilles.Some bits almost got me crying (along with half the rest of the cinema)! and to the film's credit it also, amazingly, managed to keep the huge fight scenes (mostly)enthralling.ALL in ALL, it was the type of movie that makes us forget The Return of the King, Pirates of the Caribbean, etc, and that has got to be some of the highest praise I can think of!",9.0,Anonymous,History
