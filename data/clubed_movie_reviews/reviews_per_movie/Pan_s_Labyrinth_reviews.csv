"A fey, beautiful and dark masterpiece","Set during Franco's mopping up exercise after the Spanish Civil War, Guillermo Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth is a wonderful, dark fairy tale that, in a metaphor for Spain itself, teeters on the edge of nightmare dreamscapes of corruption, violence and the death of innocents.This film is definitely not for young children. Although the fantasy sequences are gorgeously realised, and are fairy tales in the truest sense (in that they are dark, fey, dangerous and violent), most of the story (about three quarters of it, in fact) exists outside of the dreamland, in the even more frightening (and sometimes shockingly violent) world of a real life struggle of ideas and ideology.Sergi Lopez is excellent as the brutal (and possibly sadistic) Falangist Captain tasked with routing out the remaining leftists from the woods and hills of Northern Spain. Into this precarious situation come his new wife (a widow of a former marriage, who is carrying his son) and his stepdaughter Ofelia (played to absolute perfection, by the then 11 year old, Ivana Baquero).Uncomfortable with her new surroundings, suspicious of her stepfather and desperately concerned about the worsening condition of her mother, Ofelia uncovers a strange alternative world, and the chance to escape forever the pain and uncertainty of her everyday life.Thus the film alternates between the world of Civil War Spain and the increasingly bizarre, dark and frightening world of the Pan's Labyrinth. As the twin plots progress, they intertwine, with the tasks of Ofelia becoming the choices faced by a Spain at the crossroads. The poignancy of the film lies partly in the fact that the victories of the child are reflected so starkly by the failures of the adult world.Apparently Pan's Labyrinth won a 20-minute standing ovation at Cannes, when it was shown. This may be a little bit over the top. I suspect when the furore has died down some will choose to swing the pendulum back and criticise it for its more obvious faults. Much of the film is derivative. There are few ideas in the film's magical dreamworld that haven't been seen before. There are also few ideas in the film's depiction of the Civil War that can't be read in Satre or Orwell; can't be viewed in Picasso's Guernica; or can't be watched in Land and Freedom.For all the evident truth of these observations, to accept them would be to entirely miss the majesty of Pan's Labyrinth, which doesn't lie in its originality but its absolute mastery of execution. People will watch Pan's Labyrinth in a way that most won't watch Land and Freedom. In doing so, they will also discover a world of fairy tales which existed before Disney sunk its claws into them: a dangerous world, where nothing is as it seems and every step is a possible death  a place which may leave even adults shivering under the duvet, part in terror, part in wonder. And all this backed up by the finest cinematography I've seen.The only real faults I am prepared to allow for this film is a slight tendency (particularly at the end) for a Narnia-like moralism, and the fact that the faun is, perhaps, is not quite wild enough! These are eminently forgivable, though. This is easily the best film I've seen this year, and a must see on the big screen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
"Beautiful, violent, magical and sad....","I was fortunate enough to catch Pan's Labyrinth last night as part of the 'Fright Fest' programme in London and was completely blown away. Guillermo Del Toro himself was present to both introduce the movie and to answer questions afterwards. He spoke very passionately about the film, and it was easy to see why. Guillermo Del Toro has created something very special - part war movie, part fantasy, that everyone should see. The film features a fantastic performance by Sergi Lopez as Captain Vidal and as central character Ofelia, newcomer Ivana Baquero delivers the performance of a seasoned veteran. If you are the type of person who is put off by subtitled movies, don't be. This is a very 'visual' film that does not rely overly on dialogue. This does not open until 24 November in the UK and 29 December in the USA but already I am looking forward to seeing it again (and buying the Special Edition DVD).This is the first time I've felt the need to write a review on here. Do yourselves a favour and go and watch it on the big screen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Wonderful combination of fantasy and reality,"Few would dispute that 'Pan's Labyrinth' is one of the best foreign language films of the 2000s, but I would go one step further and argue that it's also one of the best modern day fantasy/adventure films in general. There aren't many films that manage to blur the lines between fantasy and reality as effectively as 'Pan's Labyrinth'. The effortless transition between the real world and the underworld and the way the two worlds are interlinked really is something special and I've never seen it done as well before.The combination of a convincing and easy to buy into storyline and the magical fantasy underworld works perfectly. The fact that both parts of the story could easily stand alone without the other, and yet go together seamlessly, is an indicator of just how good it is. The horror elements also bring something completely different and unexpected to the film, though they are tastefully added and never overdone. Overall, a wonderful film and one of the best fantasy/adventures of the 00s.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Between the violence of the real world and charm of the Fantasy. ⭐,"I know not everyone should like this movie as I am. I actually don't like this type of Fantasies. I like Fantasy movies that are belong to another Fictional Universe. Making a Fantasy movie in our world were not a great idea for me. But this movie shows you the real world, makes you feel the reality and all the bad things in the world. Then shows you a great land, I don't know like a Heaven. You're traveling one to another. You're seeing another aspect all the time.That is why this movie is so unique. It doesn't bring you another world. Bring the another world to your world. And somehow It manages to doing that so perfectly.Not only these but this movie has amazing fictonal characters. The terrifying villain, the innocent daughter that deserves to see miracles, the mother that doesn't have a choice, the creatures with unique visuals.Acting, costumes, makeups, editing are pretty good. But the Screenplay, Scores and Cinematography are just brilliant. Totally worth to see, you'll see another type of Fantasy with this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Just magical,"I saw the film at FrightFest in London a couple of days ago, and was pretty well sure I'd be seeing something special - but I ended up seeing a film that is downright extraordinary. Brutal but beautiful, magical yet earthy, it has a remarkable cast, with standout performances all round.A special mention must go to Sergi Lopez, whose 'Captain Vidal' is indeed one of the most sadistic film creations ever seen. Yet he manages to make the audience understand why he is the way he is ... an astounding performance. Maribel Verdu's quiet but rebellious housekeeper is one of the strongest female roles I've seen in many a year, and she is supported by a wealth of talent. Young Ivana Baquero is surprisingly self-assured as 12-year-old Ofelia, and I especially liked her almost Alice-like approach to the magical creatures she encounters in the labyrinth. The icing on this warped fairy tale is Doug Jones, who gives a towering performance - and in this case literally, as well as figuratively - as the guardian of the labyrinth, a faun, full of grace and charm and latent menace. Although dubbed, his Spanish is perfect (Jones speaks not a word of the language), and his physical presence is incredibly powerful as his character teases, cajoles and harries Ofelia to fulfil her tasks. He also plays the devastatingly creepy and disgusting 'Pale Man' - a creature that almost equals Vidal in his terrorising habits.But the cast is just one facet of this gloriously photographed film, with Javier Navarrete's hauntingly simple score weaving itself into the fabric of a film perfectly edited and written. The brutality of post-Civil War Spain contrasts with the world of magic to which Ofelia is drawn, yet everywhere she goes she has choices to make. In fact the film is about choices, good and bad, and one discovers that no matter how desperate a situation becomes, a choice is always available - although that choice may mean one's death. The film is violent - very violent, but each moment of brutality, although graphic, has a purpose - nowhere is it gratuitous.I loved it - as I knew I would - and if the Oscar voters don't give this film at least a nod for Best Foreign Language Film next year, then I will know that they have lost any sense of reason or comprehension. Because this film is truly a masterpiece, and Del Toro's greatest work to date.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Stop the Abuse,"An incredibly creative piece of cinema. It incorporates an amazing fantasy world with the realities of war. It gives its protagonist a way of surviving and continuing on with a life after she could have lost everything. The visuality is striking, creating a world like we've never seen. There is an amazing use of computer generated images. Everything in this film is in balance as it shifts between fantasy and the horrors of the civil war under Franco. Del Torro is a director of the first order. If you don't like him, try to realize that he takes chances and there are always naysayers out there who want to tear down that creativity. Imagine Stravinsky stopping after ""The Rite of Spring"" because the Philistines who are stuck in the past couldn't give it its due or at least have some optimism.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Unexpected brilliance.,"This is a movie with a simple and straightforward plot which contains layers and layers of intelligent writing, metaphors and message.To speak further about the script will end up in spoilers and that would be pointless since my very purpose writing this review is to encourage people to see it.This is no small feat, interpreting fantasy as something of a product of a real world, cross-referencing how the child acts to her real surroundings and the ""other world"", metaphors that describe the accelerated state of growing up some of us are put through... Incredible. Simple, straightforward yet there is so much to be appreciated.Those who are saying how it's predictable and thus not enjoyable, I ask of you, which movie nowadays aren't predictable? Hell, even 21 grams was predictable but so damned good. It's not about how it ends, you can always predict how a movie would end if you've ever taken a half-decent script writing class or have some common sense. It's always about how well you tell a story.I'm grateful there are still directors who aren't tied down to this new epidemic of including a plot twist simply because they need a plot twist.Pan's Labyrinth features some of the best storytelling and attention to detail without being affected by the now ever-popular opinion of cameras having to be put through several technical difficulties to make the shots eligible to be called a brilliant shot.I am also grateful for them not dubbing it. Watching it in its' original language is much, much more rewarding even if I had to rely on the subtitles for most of the time.This is a brilliant movie. Watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
The best fantasy of the past decade,"Everyone's been raving about this. My opinion doesn't differ too much. It did however suffer slightly from the overwhelmingly high expectations I'd developed based on how brilliant everyone said it was, and the whole ""20min ovation at Cannes"" thing. Really, who stands for that long? That said, it's an amazing work.Skipping the plot recap (find the briefest synopsis you can if you need to be filled in), I'll go straight to the tech specs. I'm not a huge Del Toro fan, Cronos was interesting but lacked something for me. Mimic was dross. Hellboy was enjoyable and Ron Perlman is always great on screen. But here, the director really outdoes himself. By far. He has wrapped together some amazing elements and somehow maintains a balance, that doesn't tip into the mundane or the ridiculous for a moment. And this is no mean feat. The story is part historical drama, part fantasy, part family melodrama. When it dips out of the fantasy, it still enchants.Sergi Lopez and Maribel Verdú really drive the story in the historical drama scenes. I haven't seen Lopez in anything other than a film called Lisbon, in which he played a character so completely opposite from the Captain. He is a fierce and terrifying guy but actually comes across as sympathetic in a couple of scenes. Verdu is incredible as Mercedes, the head housekeeper (or something) who is Ofelia's closest friend in the house. The scenes with these characters and the civil war subplot never fail to hold your attention. Ivana Baquero is excellent as the main character Ofelia, her performance is very mature and believable and she shares some beautiful scenes with her mother and Mercedes.When the fairy tale elements return, it's astounding how naturally they fit into the story. I think that is the real magic of this film. The war drama and the fairy tale stem so naturally from each other.One thing that most reviews haven't mentioned is the violence. I think it's been firmly established that this is an adult's fairytale, but at times it is a very intense and brutal film. There are a couple of scenes in particular which are very disturbing and difficult to watch. These do not distract from the tone and theme of the film however so they don't seem exploitative at all. If you are squeamish, it may get a bit much for you.A final and obvious point I spose I can't get away without making: the set design, costumes and effects are superb. That's all.I was perhaps expecting a little more fantasy, but the unique blend of genres is absolutely compelling. There wasn't a false note anywhere or a plot hole, which are too often present in fantasy films. I can't recall a good, original fantasy film from recent years. Fortunately this blows MirrorMask out of the water. It doesn't share any of the contrivances, vagueness or ineffectual characters with that film.I just wish I'd seen it without already having read so much. I've tried very hard to not reveal any plot details at all as it does go to some surprising and unexpected places. Fortunately most of the reviews have done the same. I'd urge anyone with the chance to see it to do so immediately, and try not to read too much more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
"It's good, but nowhere near as good as the reviews would have you believe","I had unsurmountable expectations for this one, and, alas, they remain unsurmounted. It didn't even come close. It is an entertaining film, but, as a whole, it feels half-baked. Near the end of the Spanish Civil War, a little girl, Ofelia, is taken with her pregnant mother to an old mill, where her new husband, a sadistic army captain, awaits. At the mill, she meets a fairy who leads her to a faun, who asks her to perform three tasks so she might take her place as princess of a magical kingdom. It's less a fantasy film than a fairy tale. In that way, I suppose I'm obliged to forgive that its fantasy world goes completely unrealized and remains paper thin throughout. Honestly, except for a couple of sequences, there really isn't a fantasy world. Most of the film takes place in the real world, where the Captain is trying to rid the area of some pesky rebels and Ofelia's mother is struggling to survive her difficult pregnancy. What is much harder to forgive, though, is that Guillermo del Toro extends the two-dimensionality to the Spanish Civil War setting. The Captain is a completely cartoonish bad guy, and the situation is seen completely in black and white. I mean, we're talking about a real conflict here where many people died. It's kind of insulting. If this were an American made film, people would be railing against it. It's also insulting to Spirit of the Beehive, on which del Toro has said he based the film. Where Spirit is a gentle yet effective study on the nature of human cruelty, Pan celebrates human cruelty with extremely violent sequences which are meant to be enjoyed as they are in action films (the director did, of course, previously make Blade II and Hellboy). Wow, it sounds like I hated this film! I didn't, really. I have some ideological problems with it, obviously, and I wish it were better than it is. But it is an enjoyable little horror/fantasy film. You could do better, but you could do worse, too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
A must see movie.,"1944, Spain, Ofelia accompanied her mother to meet up with her father, who happens to be a Captain in The Spanish Army, there Ofelia escapes into a nightmarish world, and must complete three horrifying challenges.It took me one or two viewings to fully get it, and to appreciate it, but I'm glad I did, Pan's Labyrinth is an incredible movie, it's one that will appeal to horror fans, and those that enjoy surreal stories and fantasies.Plenty of messaging to loon out for, you have to wait to learn exactly what's going on, it's worth waiting for.Beautifully acted and stunningly produced, it's a glorious looking film, I think it's aged incredibly well.Personally my favourite scene is the dinner table, Ofelia chomps down a few grapes, whilst a terrifying being wakes up, what a scene.Only from the mind of Guillermo del Toro is this possible.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
move a little! PLEASE!,"The story did interest me, took a while to get there and when it did, i like the plot but it is too stretched outwish we saw more of the other world/dimension or just monsters in general, since it was really praised for it and i expected more from the reviews////// my main complaint is that the characters think and move so slowly, when they run, when they talk, when they just see something it takes them so long and it becomes annoying to watch and starts being unenjoyable/wish there was more to the plot that was not searching around hiding and taking 20 years to do something. Hiding from the step dad, getting hurt, all while trying to find something I felt the ending was lukewarm too...//I'm still dont get why they went with ""Pan's labyrinth"" for the english title when the director also said that the faun's name is not even Pan, and critics calling it the ""Alice in wonderland for adults"" is something I can't disagree or agree with, since we see so little of the magical places but has the same vibe of it7/10 - nice to watch.

Innocence and brutality,"I saw the movie yesterday in the Spanish premiere and I confirm: it's one of the best Guillermo del Toro's films (if not the best ever). Innocence and brutality, fantasy and reality, together in a wonderful fairy tale about the power of magic in dark times. The performances are great, mainly from Sergi López, Maribel Verdú and the big revelation of the film: the 12 years girl Ivana Baquero. Del Toro repeats the context of the film ""El Espinazo del Diablo"" (""The Devil's Backbone""), the Spanish Post-Civil War, with the same philosophy: the supernatural invading the daily life in a depressive environment and the innocence of children trapped between both world. But ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is most compact, most mature and best done in very aspects, and perhaps it's the most personal movie from Del Toro.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Beautiful!,"I saw this at this years FrightFest Film Festival in London and absolutely loved it.Guillermo was there to introduce it and you can tell it really is a film he loves and is passionate about.He referred to it as a sister movie to The Devils Backbone.Anyway . . . so the film starts and I must admit I was expecting a lot more of a fantasy film however it is more of a 70/30 split between historical era movie/fantasy fairytale.Don't let this put you off though, the film really is stunning and brilliantly acted. The little girl carries pretty much the whole film on her shoulders and does so with the skill of Atlas himself!The violence is graphic and the monsters are scary but it is probably one of the most gorgeous and personal films from a director for a long time!Give it a go if you can get to a screening, DON'T WAIT FOR DVD, it really does need to be seen on a big screen!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
A labyrinth you don't  want to leave,"I saw this film toward the end of the Cannes Film Festival; it edged out all the others I'd seen, 30 of them, because of its wonderful story; history, politics and fantasy woven into a fabric spun by a superlative creative team headed by Guillermo del Toro. In comparison to this, his latest effort, del Toro's other films only hinted at the depth and breadth of his talent. In this film, much as I pride myself on foreseeing the outcome of most stories, I could not guess what would happen next. The film is quite long, yet suspense is sustained throughout. The music is some of the best I've heard in years, so well suited to the action that you almost don't notice its specific effect because of how well it is intertwined with the visual, emotional and intellectual experience.In my opinion, del Toro's ""...Labyrinth"" deserved to win at Cannes over the Ken Loach film, ""The Wind That Shakes the Barley"". Actually, everyone I knew at the Festival who had seen both agreed with me. And the 22 minute ovation speaks clearly for the effect on the audience. It's hard to imagine that any film could beat it in a context other than Cannes where they have marked preferences, bordering on obsession, for certain directors.Let's hope that the late December opening favors an Oscar nomination which it should win hands down, unless some other work of genius appears on the horizon. That doesn't seem likely because at Cannes the somewhat disappointing array of films was attributed to the fact that not much great product is being released this year. I might add that I had already seen Volver prior to Pan's Labyrinth, and I maintain that Pan is the better film. For me, it displaced all three of my top films of the year. I do love The Departed but, luckily, that's in another category which does not threaten Pan's access to Oscar. If I had to choose the very best picture of the year, without limitation by category, it would most assuredly go to Pan's Labyrinth for it demonstrates del Toro's originality and brilliance as both writer and director.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Superb performances,"It is Guillermo del Toro's best film ( 22 minutes ovation at Cannes). Del Toro gets a brilliant film but also superb performances from all involved, particularly from Sergi Lopez as a brutal Fascist army captain Vidal and Doug Jones (Abe Sapien from del Toro's Hellboy) as the Pan and the wonderfully disturbing Pale Man. But the real find is Ivana Baquero (12 years old) as the young heroine Ofelia. She gives one of the best performances from a child actor we have seen since Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense. Come to it unprepared and with your mind wide open and you will be rewarded with one of the best films of the year.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
"Good movie, reviews maybe made it a disappointment.",I wish I had never seen any reviews about this movie before watching it! It made my expectations so much higher. I think it was just a good movie nothing great! I expected a lot more.,7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
"Good, but not as good as they'll have you believe","I went into this movie with no expectations, except that I'd see a Spanish-language, adult-oriented fantasy film with English subtitles. I think unmet expectations can hurt people in two ways: either the film disappoints them and they are overly critical as a result, or they are disappointed but too biased to admit it. I think the latter has led to an exceedingly generous rating for this particular film. Is it good? Yes. Is it the 65th best (according to current IMDb ratings) movie of all time? Not even close.It is an interesting, original story. Virtually every actor appearing in the film is superb. The imagery is magnificent. Like I said, it is a good picture. However, I am puzzled as to why it is praised so highly. I would have a greater appreciation for the film if its adult-oriented nature was due to its substance, such as an intellectual, sophisticated and enigmatic storyline. It is adult-oriented, however, merely because of a few choice phrases and displays of graphic violence. This is not a film that is breaking new ground. It is too simplistic throughout, becomes fairly predictable, and lacks fluidity. The unimaginative way in which the fantasy elements come and go was a real put off. The 65th best movie of all time should have the fantastic elements blended seamlessly with the human elements. It should continue being original throughout. It should challenge the viewer in new and engaging ways. It should not merely curse, show some blood, and have pretty imagery.Please, see this movie and enjoy it. I truly did. I also, however, allowed myself to make a realistic assessment afterward. I expect that the rating will come down as the novelty of an adult-oriented fantasy picture wears off. Maybe I missed something, but I doubt a specious film like this can conceal such intricacies.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Not strong enough in important ways to make it the classic everyone is hailing it as but certainly interesting and engaging enough to be one of stronger films of 2006,"Carmen has married Captain Vidal and, pregnant with his son, travels with her daughter Ofelia to join him in his woodland barracks where he is trying to quash the small bands of rebellion against the Fascist regime. Carmen is not well and Vidal immediately puts her into the care of Dr Ferreiro who confines her to her bed after a short time. Vidal is a cruel man, perhaps hardened by the battle he fights and the beliefs he holds and Ofelia finds him to have no time for her and her no interest in him. While she tries to cope with the reality of her new life she also finds herself taken by a fairy into a dark underworld where a faun offers her a new life as a princess if she completes a series of tasks for him.With all the papers and amateur reviewers here putting this film high up the list of best films of 2006 I rued that I missed my chance to see the film when it originally came out but got the opportunity recently on holiday in Cornwall at what my girlfriend called the ""smallest cinema on earth"" (it wasn't but it must have been close). Perhaps the weight of expectation on the film played a part but I confess to have enjoyed it but not found the masterpiece that the majority have claimed. The film works pretty well and has a very strong central narrative which, contrary to the marketing, is actually the real world and not the fantasy. This is an engaging real-world horror that focuses on the struggle between guerrilla fighters and the fascists led by Vidal. On the other side of the coin we have the fantasy involving Ofelia where, like the real world, she finds a world of darkness where she is not entirely sure who to trust. Now my main problem with the film is the overlap between these two elements and how they fit together.I have read others say that the fantasy echoes the real world but, as much as I want to see this, it just didn't ring true for me. On a very basic level I get it but that is different from the film cleverly weaving them together and making it work. This separation detracted from both aspects of the story (although less so the real parts) and also saw the fantasy be only partially explained and harder to become really engaged with. My girlfriend said she felt the story was simplistic enough to work best for older children and that the ""horror"" part was therefore too harsh as it prevented this audience getting in the door (in the UK this was rated a 15). At first I agreed with her but on reflection it actually works the other way because this is much more of an adult tale but just doesn't quite have the intelligence and complexity in all parts of the story (again specifically the fantasy).By this point my review will have been slated by all readers who are not used to a dissenting voice but for those who have made it this far let me just say that it is a very good film overall and that I did enjoy it. Outside of the plot there is much to enjoy as well. The writing is very good and the dialogue (albeit subtitled) interesting and never clunky or obvious even if some of the scenes would have made it easy for it to be so. The fantasy world is wonderfully created and engagingly dark with the creatures a mix of wonder and menace. The faun himself is good and well used although it was a shame to see such a terrifying vision such as the pale man so briefly used and with little expansion beyond a lurching menace in one scene. Del Toro directs well across all aspects of the film and keeps this sense of dark menace across everything. I also liked the references scattered across the narrative, such as Alice in Wonderland to name one in particular. He directs his cast well too, drawing a very good performance from Baquero in the central role. López could have hammed it up but, while he doesn't really make a person here, he avoids being a pantomime baddie. Verdú is strong as Mercedes while Gil is good but left with little to do outside of suffer and worry. Jones does well within his creatures to deliver the potential within the design.Overall then not strong enough in important ways to make it the classic everyone is hailing it as but certainly interesting and engaging enough to be one of stronger films of 2006. Visually impressive and very well delivered, I'm afraid I just found it hard to get over the disconnect between the two aspects of the story no matter how much I wanted to find it.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Recycled clichés in plodding storyline.,"I stuck around for this movie to serve something not yet seen or experienced in dozens of related films which I was so sure this movie would provide. Sadly, that moment never came.Although I have no complaints with the acting and setdesigns which were on par with any quality movie, there are basically three things that deprive this movie of being anything great.1. Though truly beautifully shot, Pan's two sided scenario with the Good vs Evil Children's-picture on the one side and a drama/war-movie on the other, provides no deeper layers. A 'what you see is what you get' type of film in which the fantasy part seemed more or less something that would look nice on the adverts in combination with a superabundance of very graphic violence in a foreign movie which offers a subterfuge to sell something slight and cursory as profound and insightful.2. Since there is no thread running through both the scenario's it is like watching two different movies which bear very little to each other nor compliment the other. Because I liked the fantasy part zealously better than the war/drama bit, I was very disappointed that it had no follow-through and that it in the end just seemed like a shameless cloned-off short-impression of movies like Alice in Wonderland, The Wizzard of Ozz and The never Ending Story, to name but a few, but never with a meaningful reference of any kind. It is almost like the writers hit behind the fact that they never even saw these movies.3.There is just nothing subtle in the story that draws you in, I found it all annoyingly superficial and cliché. It never invites you to share the little girl's fantastic world or truly reject El Capitan's actions because it is all far too black and white. Plus the film leaves no room for any other interpretation aside from the one which is already painted elaborately on its cinematic walls. Something I find quite odd since most true children's pictures have a lot underlying messages and symbolism. The more I think about it, the more this story just seems lazily written or without any terribly interesting thought behind it. -In the end of it all, there is simply no hope-..nothing more than a flipflop of any and all sappy-happy-endings Hollywood has been laying on us for years on end.Furthermore, with style over substance as its forté the movie tends to plod tremendously at times. And since none of the characters are really focused on, they all just seem to be stereotypes and are hence neither likable nor unlikable despite their (too) obvious good or bad demeanors. Vidal is simply bad, mom is simply weak and Ofelia was nothing more than the little girl playing with imaginary friends in the corner of the room.This film is alas just another example of a movie where they just don't seem to be able to get it both ways (powerful story AND powerful cinematography) which is the Achilles' heel of many a film lately but which oddly doesn't seem to bother the average moviegoer nor professional movie-critic who somehow seem to think that foreign+different=Masterpiece.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
A Gothic Masterpiece,"Playing moments of true wonderment off scenes of sadistic brutality, Guillermo del Toro has created an epithet for classical fairy tales reminiscent of the traditional stories which amazed - yet simultaneously frightened - children.Del Toro offers us two worlds through the perspective of young Ofelia. The first - reality - is the cruelty of Franco's Spain; where Ofelia is whisked away to her sadistic step-father (played brilliantly by Sergi Lopez) who is attempting to root out the last remnants of the Republic. The second - fantasy - is the underground kingdom - or more precisely the promise of such a world - as Ofelia must complete three tasks for the beautifully constructed faun in order to prove her worth of being a part of such a utopia. What elevates Pan's Labyrinth above other fantasises, however, is the fact that its reality sequences are just as intriguing as its fantasy elements - a rare feat - and the two meld together perfectly.For instance, the faun may offer interestingly ambiguous revelations about Ofelia's destiny, but only if she follows his orders. Yet he doesn't necessarily mean what he says, and the presence of the Fascists in Ofelia's reality suggests that blindly following orders is the complete opposite of what she should do. So, while there are trips into the magical world (including a disturbing yet inherently memorable scene with the hieronymus bosch-like spectre known as the 'Pale Man') they do not overwhelm the film.The true horror and the meat of the story lies in Falangist Spain with the menacing Captain Vidal, who takes delight in torture - ritually preparing his tool kit and reciting his own speech to demoralise his victims - and who is equally obsessed with the continuation of his bloodline. The fantasy world is indeed where Ofelia's lessons are learned so that she may confront the terrors of reality; the most important of which being the need for courageous disobedience in the face of extreme oppression. Pan's Labyrinth therefore successfully and perfectly captures the essence of classical children's literature; combining fantasy with moments of horror, all with an underlying and ultimately crucial message which we must take head of in reality. The final scene is also a true whopper; with a killer of a send-off line and an ambiguous ending which still fuels debates to this day.Thankfully, del Toro uses CGI sparingly, although it is very obvious when it is used (particularly in the case of the giant toad) but this doesn't detract from the film's overall brilliance. It's dark, at times disturbing, but nevertheless beautiful, a true Gothic tale if there ever was one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
It really deserves all the acclaim,"The negative reviews of this film on IMDb seem to fall into two categories: a) it was too violent b) the fantasy element was too mutedWithout getting too political, worse things are going on in the world at this very moment than were depicted in this film. While many people prefer entertainment that insulates them from the harsh realities of this world, one shouldn't get so indignant when a film portrays the world for what it is. Capitán Vidal was a fictitious character, but there are plenty of people exactly like him. Humans are capable of terrible atrocities and looking the other way does nothing to improve our nature. If violence offends people so much they should do something about real violence rather than writing nasty reviews about depictions of it.The violence set a tone of desperation for Ofelia. Fairy tales themselves are extremely violent, and Disney cartoons are nothing like the stories they were based on. This film was rated R. What were you expecting?It is easier to understand people who thought the fantasy element was eclipsed, and were maybe hoping for another Narnia or one of the other countless fantasy flicks that has come out in the wake of LOTR. This film touched on many of the most fundamental themes of mythology, such as parallel worlds, dangerous tasks, hidden identities, sacrifice, and death. It did something more than the standard fantasy movie, which is part of why it was such a great film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Closest Thing To Art That Film Has Experienced In Years,"I just finished the movie today and I must say that this is by far one of the most artistic and beautiful movies I have seen in years. The producers of the film were right to call this a modern fairytale, since it has all the ingredients for an authentic Brothers Grimm story. Just don't expect there to be lots of happy faces in the film. This is a real, bloody (very bloody), moody, emotional fairy tale just like the ones in the past.First of all, I have to say that the technical design in this film was astounding. The art direction was spot on for all the locations, whether its the imaginary world of the labyrinth or the mill that the fascists call their base. The music is some of the best I've heard in a film for a long time, drawing that fantasy feel of the movie perfectly and inspiring so many emotions in one chord than other films could in their whole screening. The sound was top notch as well, never sounding like just a compilation of reused sound effects. And of course, the make-up design is flawless and imaginative. The biggest shock was the cinematography. Now, I personally thought Children of Men should have got the Oscar for this, but understand now why this won. Each shot is beautifully staged, colored and detailed in a way that they cease to be movie shots and become portraits of art.Guillermo Del Toro really surprised me. Not only did he assemble a surprisingly talented cast, but he was able to make you really connect with the situation. The characters are all well developed and the symbolism, though subtle, is so delicious that it makes me tingle with the thought of it. The dialogue is natural and authentic and he handles the film expertly to convey that timeless feel even through some of the film's harsher moments. You really feel this is a labor of love, since it bears its fruits at every scene. I didn't even mind that I had to read subtitles (which I think Del Toro knew that he would have to use it wisely, since the scenes are designed so you are not distracted reading the text to enjoy the scene).If I had any complaints, its that some of the visual effect designs were sometimes inferior. They weren't bad, but they had some rough edges that should have been addressed.I recommend this for anyone who has a strong stomach, an eye for art and a heart. It deserved all its Oscar wins and noms and should have won for its amazing music. This is the new standard for film art for the modern generation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Amazing Atmosphere,"This film has such a unique style and essence, its beautiful and magical as much as it is ugly and harsh.I have never seen a movie quite like this one, I went into it not knowing much about it (I had seen the hands with eyes but that was about it) so it was very much a sense of discovery as the tale and the fantasy unfolded before me.Way more violent than I would have guessed but the story is brutal and cruel so it is fitting.If you are into the art-form of film (not just a movie buff) then this is a must watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Quite possibly the best foreign language film I have ever seen!,"Don't let the fact that it is in Spanish throw you. This is a dark, moving and sometimes terrifying masterpiece of a film. Director Guilliemo Del Torro directs with briskness and deep understanding of the film. The film looks gorgeous, very beautiful in one scene, and quite Gothic in another. Another director I can think of that directs visually stunning films is Ridley Scott. The music score by Javier Navarette is haunting, poignant and beautiful. The script is very mysterious, suspenseful and genuinely moving at times, and there are some genuinely memorable characters, the idealistic protagonist, the brutal stepfather, the pregnant mother and the caring housemaid. Here is one of the few fantasies where the images stay with you forever. There are beautiful costumes and a stunning forest set, the labyrinth is very Gothic and dark, as is the wise and mysterious faun, and the war and torture scenes are unashamedly graphic. Another honourable mention should go to the monster that tricks children into eating his food when he is asleep, and then he wakes up and eats them. He was so terrifying, the very look of him, made my blood run cold. He is one of the most terrifying creatures I have ever seen in the history of film. All in all, a visually stunning and absolutely magnificent film, with a definite 10/10. Bethany Cox.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Entartaining but not one of the very best movies from last year,"When I heard first time about the movie made by the Mexican director Guillermo del Toro that was a mixture of many genres, including drama, fantasy, thriller, and fairy tale for adults that takes place in Spain of 1944 in two parallel words, one of unbearable bleak and horrifying reality, and the other of deliciously dark magic fantasy, I wanted very much to see it. I knew that the movie has been praised by many critics and has made hundreds top lists of last year, that it was nominated for countless awards including six Academy awards and it won three Oscars, and that it had received 20 minutes standing ovation at Cannes. The main reason for me was the fact that I love del Toro's earlier film, ""The Devil's Backbone"" (2001), the ultimate ghost story that goes beyond the genre and very successfully mixes horror, suspense, and coming of age during the war time story.I hoped and expected ""Pan's Labyrinth"" to be as compelling, insightful, interesting, and engaging as ""The Devil's Backbone"" was. I finally saw ""Pan's Labyrinth"" couple of days ago and I was disappointed. The movie has an interesting concept, even if not original one. It brings to mind many famous works of literature and the earlier movies about the little girls escaping their dreadful realities of war or death of the loved ones or all sorts of abuse in the world of their imagination such as ""Forbidden Games"", ""Spirits of the Beehive"" (which ""Pan's Labyrinth"" tried to be but never was), the later also takes place in Spain during the Civil war, as well as ""Wizard of Oz"", ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""Legends and Myths of Ancient Greece"".One movie that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" has been often compared to is Terry Gilliam's ""Tideland"", his fairy tale for adults, his ""Alice in Wonderland meets Psycho"" which also tells the story of an 11-years-old girl and her world of imagination. ""Tideland"" was released last year and was either ignored or hated by majority of critics and left many viewers puzzled and confused. I am not completely in love with ""Tideland"" but I found it much more interesting that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" in all aspects. The main difference between the two - Gillian does not present reality in his film in the simplistic way and does not divide his characters to devilish monsters or shining knights the way Del Toro does in ""Pan Labyrinth"".I am not sure what the target audience for Del Toro's film is? Its story (the writer/director was nominated for the best screenplay and I found his writing the weakest and most ridiculous part of the movie) is so naive and primitive that you would think the movie was made for children but its shocking violence and horrifying tortures are not easy to watch even for adults. Another problem is with the characters. I know I should sympathize with Ofelia, and who would not feel empathy for an 11-year-old girl who had to live through the death of her mother and to confront her monstrous step-father but if frankly, her character is not very interesting. As for visual effects and cinematography, the film looks good but not especially spectacular or breathtakingly beautiful. Of five Oscar nominated films for best cinematography from last year, at least three seemed to be more interesting. Gilliam's ""Tideland"" that was completely ignored by the Academy, is always technically superb, visually arresting and much more impressive than ""Pan's Labyrinth"".I should admit that at least one scene in ""Labyrinth"" was absolutely brilliant - dark and scary it came directly from Francisco Goya's terrifying painting, ""Saturn Devouring His Children"" and it was extremely imaginative. I would not go as far as calling ""Pan's Labyrinth"" a bad movie and give it one star. It is not bad; it is just not as great as I thought it would be. As for all the awards, ""The Devil's Backbone"" is much more deserving than ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and that's the film I would give a standing ovation to.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
A Truly Modern Fairytale,"Guillermo del Toro how to tell a real fairy tale. A fairy tale that isn't all princesses, princes, magical fairies and happy endings. It might have them, but the point that has been sanitised out of fairy tales over the last century or so is the fact that they were originally cautionary tales for children, handed down through generations of oral tradition to teach children what life is. And what is the one fact that children should learn as soon as possible? That life is nasty!Laberinto del Fauno (titled Pan's Labyrinth here, though no mention is ever made to the faun in the film being Pan) is the story of Ofelia, a little girl forced to move with her pregnant mother to rural Spain to be near her step-father, a Captain in the fascist army during the Spanish Civil War. As she experiences first hand the horrors of war and fascism, she enters an ancient maze and meets a faun who tells her she is a lost Princess of an underground kingdom and must pass three tests to claim her place there.I will admit that I went into this film expecting a nice, children friendly movie, but del Toro pulls no punches when it comes to the war, a war he experienced as a child. It's hard sometimes to decide what was more important to the director; Ofelia's story, or whether that was just a backdrop to highlight all the more the cruelty and brutality of the war.There are no Indiana Jones style comedy Nazis here, the fascists are truly evil and we see it. Both the violence (which is just graphic enough to prevent us from being able to ignoring it without ever being gratuitous) and the mindsets of the people involved. What is more disturbing that any of the on screen actions is the attitude of 'pull the ladder up jack, I'm alright' of those who find themselves in privileged positions. Ariadna Gil, as Ofelia's mother showcases this perfectly. She knows full well what Vidal thinks of her only as a vessel for him unborn son, and that he probably killed Ofelia's father, but she never seems to resent him. Neither does she ever seem to love him. What you get is more a kind of relief, she knows that as long as he has a use for her she and her daughter are safe. It's purely self preservation, to know your place and survive, and that is more disturbing to me than anything else in the film.Sometimes it's even almost as if Ofelia's quest is the subplot, as even fantastical tales of giant toads, fauns, a magical kingdom, the Pale Man (a horrific creature with it's eye in its hands) pale into insignificance when we're faced with the true life horrors that we see mankind inflict upon itself.And that's one of the most interesting aspects of the story. Even as everything goes on around her, as the Civil War rages around her, her mothers life lies in Captain Vidal hands, what can the innocent do. Ofelia is not part of this world, she hasn't had a hand in creating it and she does not have a hand in affecting it's outcome. The faun and his quests are, to her at least, far more important as they are something that she is involved in, that are about her.On the technical side this is a beautifully crafted film. The cinematography and sets are wonderful, never once setting a difference between the real and the fantasy. Both aspects of the film seem just as important to del Toro, some directors would have favoured one or the other sides of the story and that would have made the film unbalanced.It's clearly influenced by many fairy tales, and a nice touch is, like many movie fairy tales, we never certain whether the fantasy is real. Is Ofelia really a lost princess from a magical kingdom, or are all her adventures and meetings purely from her imagination, one of the stories she tells to her unborn brother expanded to protect her from the nightmares of real life? What Guillermo del Toro has done with this film is to create a beautiful fairy tale masterpiece that harks back to the days when fairy tales were told around a fire to scare children, not read at bedtime to put them to sleep. But despite what I said earlier about this not being a children's film, take some to see it and I still think they'd enjoy it, even if it was from behind the cushion.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Good but not great.,First lets start with the 20 minute standing ovation this film supposedly got at Cannes. After watching the film I don't believe it. Someone must have exaggerated the length of time by at least 18 minutes. That or those apparently ecstatic people were drunk. Don't get me wrong this is a good film. But the praise this is getting from critics and people writing here is way over the top. I was fully expecting a work of real vision and/or originality but what I experienced was a film that borrows from other films and admittedly gels everything together into a cohesive and impressive whole. A lot of great films do the same but 'Pans Labrynth' has other faults that prevent it from being put in the same category as the truly great films.'Pans Labrynth' at times is too predictable - a side effect from borrowing from other films - therefore some scenes feel clichéd. Also the tasks the girl has to complete in order to take her place as princess could have been more imaginatively realized. Finally the message/point/allegory of the film is trite and simplistic. Still worth watching but is this really one of the top 100 films of all time? Not even close...,7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
A beautiful journey through the imagination of a child and the realities around her,"One of the best fantasy films and arguably Del Toro's finest work. The viewer is immersed in a visual world inside the mind of a child trying to survive the violent realities in the world that is evolving around her. It is the perfect opening into a childs escape into the fantasy realm, which may be real or not, that is left up to the viewer to decide.Harrowingly violent in places and beautifully gentle in others, this is a journey full of unknown corners and tension as well as astounding creativity and visual delights.This almost stands as a two part story, one in the fantasy realm and one in the harrowing events of spain at war, both folding together with a little girl who finds herself existing between both.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
A beautiful and sad fairy tale,"When I first saw the movie, I must not have been very far from the age of the protagonist. I rejoiced because I too had tried many times to open magic doors with pencils. And I was terribly afraid of the banquet-keeper for months. Even though I was a child and even though I was made uncomfortable by the atmosphere of the movie, I could not tear myself away from it, as no child can tear his eyes away from a fairy world.Pan's Labyrinth is a beautiful and sad story, a fairy tale that perfectly captures what it means to be a child in a crude world.

somewhat less than the sum of its parts,"One of the cardinal rules of any good fairy tale is that, no matter how fantastical it becomes, it must make sure to keep one foot firmly planted in reality so that the story can more easily connect with the audience. In the case of ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" however, that foot may be so firmly planted in the real world that it actually prevents the movie from cutting loose and soaring into the stratosphere of imagination and enchantment in the way we wish it would.The movie takes place in 1944, five years after the end of the Spanish Civil War that has left Franco in power and bands of defeated Leftist rebels hiding out in the Iberian countryside. Eleven-year-old Ofelia arrives with her pregnant mother to the estate of Captain Vidal, a vicious fascist who, in a clever bit of fairy tale role reversal, plays the part of the evil stepfather of the story. As Vidal busies himself with hunting down the pesky Communist outcasts, Ofelia discovers herself drawn to a strange alternate universe, unbound by the laws of nature, which frequently opens up for her to enter and to which she alone seems privy.There's no denying that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is an extremely well made movie, miles above the average American fantasy film in terms of both sophistication and vision. Director Guillermo del Toro has fashioned a dark, violent, exquisitely realized world filled with secret passageways and awe-inspiring creatures to which Ofelia periodically retreats in an attempt to escape the even more brutal life around her. Like Judy Garland in ""The Wizard of Oz,"" the lovely Ivana Baquero is the perfect heroine for the tale: wide-eyed, curious and filled with an intense longing for a world better than the one that entraps her. The movie is a miracle of art direction, set design, makeup and special effects, and it boasts some of the most dramatic use of sound this side of ""Das Boot.""Yet, for all its good points, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" winds up disappointing us a bit in the end. For much of its running time, the movie seems to be operating in two largely different spheres - that of reality and that of fantasy - and having a hard time bringing the two together into a unified, coherent whole. It spends too much time chronicling the conflict between the fascist general and the rebels in the forest - which might be interesting in a different context and another movie - and not enough focusing on Ofelia's otherworldly adventures. Even though the emotional pull back to Kansas was never far from Dorothy's - and the audience's - consciousness, Baum knew enough not to spend too much actual time there. Del Toro, on the other hand, seems not to be able to yank himself from the scene, the result of which is that the fantasy world never exerts the magical force on us that it might have done had it been more thoroughly developed and taken a more center stage in the drama. The magical world in ""Pan's Labyrinth"" lacks the sort of densely plotted, compelling narrative one finds in the ""Lord of the Rings"" saga or ""The Wizard of Oz."" We don't get a clear picture of what the land itself is like, who its various inhabitants are, and what Ofelia's real role will be once she gets there.Thus, although the parts in ""Pan's Labyrinth"" are better than the whole, thanks to the quality of the film-making and of Baquero's performance, those parts are often indelible and unforgettable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Gillermo del Toro maybe best product as yet!,"Now to be perfectly honest with you ,dear reader, I am a HUGE fan of del Toro films, with the Hellboy movies been among my favorites superhero and fantasy movies and Pacific Rim the best flick about giant robots since Iron Giant, so yes I genuinely believe he is a great director, writer and producer. And as far as I see it his best work as yet this one Pan's Labyrinth one of the most beautiful, atmospheric and captivating film I have ever seen in my life.The story takes place in Spain after the Civil War of 1936 to 1939 and follows the young bookish girl Ofelia ,who goes with her pregnant mother to a military camp under to control of her step-father, the general and commander of that place and one of the most cruel, arrogant and sadistic villain in movie history, who could give Ramsay Bolton a run for his money. During her stay at each opportunity she has, escapes in to a fantasy world that is just around her corner and confronts creatures that are both amazing to look at and totally terrifying. The movie also gives time to the rebel group that is hunted down by the Franco forces and their tries to survive and beat back the fascist in the camp.The contrast between the fantasy world that we among side Ofelia explore and the real one is close to perfect for we see both similarities and differences. To elaborate on that this contrast makes it impossible to see these two worlds separated for when you look closely you find out that in their structures and designs have some parallels that are too go to spoil you have to see them yourself.Another great thing about the flick is that the story feels like a fairy tail, but isn't like those we all know like Snow White and the seven dwarfs, Sleeping Beauty , the Little Mermaid and so on. For del Toro turn the model of the classic fairy tails complete on its head and gives you a story which feels both realistic in plot, out of this world when it comes to the fantasy elements, which looks as they were the child for a beautiful dream with a horrifying nightmare and you want to look over and stare at it at the same time.As for the acting, is perfect with Ivana Baquero that plays Ofelia been so good that for a while I forgot that she was acting, Doug Jones as the titled Pan as is usual for him been in to the character( literally) and the rest of the cast having their time to shine.For anyone who likes creature feature, fantasy, the fairy tails with a twist or in general good movies is a must watch, like now. And to close with a warning, it is not a film for children, not at all ,it is for a more mature audience ,so if you want to watch it with your kid, young nephew or niece ,do it as your own digression.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Thuggish,"I get annoyed at movies that preach one thing and are themselves another.The story here has two components, a real and fantasy thread. The real world thread is simple. By that I mean there are no dramatic complications at all. The characters are theatrical cartoons. The situation starts out brutally and stays that way without any arc, development, evolution. It is in fact a formula movie, this thread, and one that follows a formula that is based on strict, strict boundaries. One would suspect it was written by a German, it is so regimented. One would almost believe it to be written by ""The Captain,"" the bad guy here.It marches. Its unambiguous. Its final and brutal in its morality, just as the Captian is. There are only good and bad people and the bad are not only very, very bad but they get their deserts. Justice isn't nuanced here. In fact nothing at all is.I suppose people celebrate it for its fantasy thread. Yes, the effects are good. Yes the creepy eyeless man was creepy. Yes the Tinkerbells were Tinkerbelly. But is this in any way better than ""Dark Crystal,"" which was similarly banal in its cosmology?Look, I'm one of the ones who get depressed at things like ""The Matrix,"" but if lacking in imagination, is copying was deep, complex, manylayered. This is something that Franco would have written, and little fascist parents would have trotted to, because its all about absolutes and the inability of humans to be rich, subtle, varied beings.The best we can do, is be ""innocent.""I often can see some good in any film. But not this one. The world is too close to intolerant extremism as it is.

Characters are just stereotypes,"After reading all the positive reviews and being a great fan of Maribel Verdu (since her role in ""Amantes""), I had great expectations before seeing this movie. Quite honestly, I was disappointed. The characters lack depth. All falangistas are incredibly bad and sadistic, and all nationalists republicans are good in this movie. Stereotypic. If Del Toro wanted to make Capitan Vidal really terrifying, he would have made a little bit more sympathetic at times, like ""Landa"" in Inglourious Basterds - probably the most terrifying nazi ever on the silver screen. Vidal could at least have been a little bit concerned for his wife when she was bearing his unborn son. But now, he is a facha macho, so he can not show emotions at any time. Even the symbolism of the labyrinth is too easy : especially the end, where the self sacrifice of Ofelia is a clear sign of a Messias, including the invitation to sit at the right hand of her father in a sort of a pagan Trinity (with her mother). The cinematography however is wonderful and the actor perform well, but the scenario is just too shallow for my taste.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
A captive and beautiful movie,"When I first saw this movie, I had this rare feeling like entering another world with my whole body and mind from beginning till the end. It was written and directed by Guillermo del Toro, produced and distributed internationally by Esperanto Filmoj and Warner Bros.
The story takes place in Spain in the summer of 1944, five years after the Spanish Civil War, during the early Francoist period. 
Pan's Labyrinth takes place in Spain in 1944s, during a time of Spanish civil war. A ruthless Captain has set up camp in a distant forest, and requests that his pregnant step-wife and her fantasy-obsessed daughter, Ofelia join him there.Del Toro stated that he considers the story to be a parable, influenced by fairy tales, and that it addresses and continues themes related to his earlier film The Devil's Backbone (2001) to which Pan's Labyrinth is a spiritual successor, according to del Toro in his director's DVD commentary. 
The original Spanish title refers to the fauns of Roman mythology, while the English title refers specifically to the faun-like Greek deity Pan. 
The film won numerous international awards.
There are some visually brutal scenes in it, so attention. 
The acting is amazing, especially the young Ivana Baquero, playing Ofelia. 
The animation is phenomenal, but not nearly as breathtaking as the costumes or scenery. The labyrinth itself just sucks all the breath out of you when you see it at night for the first time. Pay attention to the great ""pale man"": a most terrifying creature in the movie.

Does this girl imagine all these things to help her deal with her situation and the war or are they actually happening?You'll find yourself questioning it, both ways. Regardless of what you personally think is true, it's a good war-time drama about family and resistance set in fascist Spain.VFX mix with practical effects in the best of ways, just like with other Del Toro movies.

Guillermo del Toro is a visionary,It's 1944 in fascist Spain. Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is going up to the mountains with her mother to live with her stepfather. Her father was a simple tailor who died during the civil war. Her mother married the cruel vicious Captain. She's pregnant with his son and he cares more about him than her. He is hunting the revolutionary hold outs hiding in the mountains. Ofelia finds odd looking ruins and sees a fantasy world in them. Meanwhile Mercedes (Maribel Verdú) is working at the house while helping the revolutionaries in the woods.This movie sets Guillermo del Toro up as a cinematic visionary. It is visually imaginative and unique. The acting is mostly well done headed by the always compelling Maribel Verdú. Ivana Baquero has the innocent look that is so essential. The violence can be brutal. It's like a fairy tale fantasy got mixed up with a horror movie.,9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

Pointless,"It is really interesting that a movie so enjoyed by some viewers can be so annoying for others. This is my general impression when I read reviews on IMDb.

The only amazing aspect of this movie is that so many viewers find it so great. OK, for sure it's visually beautiful and unusual in terms of story-telling technique, but the story is so unpleasant, one-dimensional and pointless that I just to wanted to get away from the cinema (which almost never happens).Since I do not understand how anyone can find this movie enjoying, I will just try help you people who get disturbed by the same movie elements as myself. So if you often find the following aspects annoying in movies you should be careful before buying a ticket to this one.* Over-simplification of evil through characters that are extremely bad for no obvious reason (black or white - no gray scales)* Extreme violence that is completely pointless and makes you feel sick* Sympathetic characters that you are supposed to sympathize with immediately without really getting to know them* Two parallel story-paths (fantasy vs reality), none of which has any absorbing plot, and are completely unrelated to each other during most of the movieNormally I hate when people express their anger and give a 1 star rating because they hate a movie that everyone else finds so great, so the only good thing about PL is that I can at least start to understand how people can become so angry with a so called cinematic masterpiece.PS. My interpretation is that PL is a movie for artistic people that enjoy getting emotional through fuzzy fairy tales about good and evil, whereas it is not a movie for thinking people that wants to attain a higher understanding of the good and evil in man with some structure and logical congruence in the end. OK, PL actually has some congruence in the end, but this doesn't save a movie that is simply repugnant from start to finish.",3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Del Toro doing what he does best,"Wow. I'm not going to lie, it took me a long time to actually get to this movie. I knew almost nothing about it but the title so I went into this completely blind. This is a masterpiece. I didn't think you can combine a grounded war film with whimsical(yet darkly eerie) fantasy without the tones of the story clashing with each other but that madlad Guillermo del Toro did it. As ashamed as I am to admit this is my first time actually watching this movie, I am glad to say I got around to it and it was worth it big time. Do not stall like I did, watch this asap! I will certainly be revisiting Pan's Labyrinth.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Grace in the Midst of Evil,"Pan's Labyrinth is a moving film about grace in the midst of evil. It can be appreciated on at least two levels. A little girl and her mother move to the countryside of Spain to be with the mother's new husband in the final days of her pregnancy. The girl, Ophelia comes across a labyrinth in which she meets a faun. He gives her three tasks to complete by the full moon to prove she is the lost daughter of the King of the underworld. This movie shows her doing the tasks and dealing with the complications of the mother's pregnancy. It is an extremely moving story of a soul's journey to its father. As you watch the movie you can see that the cinematography, especially the lighting, corresponds with the meaning and outcome of the movie. Pan's Labyrinth is a movie with great spiritual insight on who we are and who our father is. Unquestionably one of the greatest films I have ever seen. I recommend this movie, as it gives a glimpse of the deeper meaning of the world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

One of the best movies for ages to come...,"This is the first time I write a review for a movie, and it happens to be for my favorite ever. I remember watching it back in 2007, and I was mesmerized by the cinematography, the performances, the direction and the music that makes you travel with your mind. But the most fascinating thing was the way the real world and the fantasy world are connected. Guillermo Del Toro proved to be a master at this. It's a war movie, a fantasy movie, a drama movie, a horror movie and it excels at all these parts.
As far as the performances are concerned, Ivana Baquero really delivers (despite her young age) and Sergi Lopez truly becomes one of the most convincing and hateful bad characters in the history of cinema. The rest of the supporting cast is remarkable too.No matter how great I think this movie is, I would not recommend it to everyone. I work in a DVD Club and I have noticed that not all people can appreciate it. It is certainly not because of the spanish language, but the fact that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a perfect representative of -what I call- thinking cinema. It is a movie that will make you think of it for days after you have watched it. It includes so many symbolisms and life lessons... But for those who like this kind of movies, I would say ""Watch it now!"".
Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to Mr. Del Toro because he gave us a movie to remember for years... A movie which combines the misery, the hope and the dreams that make us feel alive.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

A word about the violence,"After seeing the film, and after reading many of the comments, I would like to say something about the violence that has attracted so much attention.This film is violent, but not in the adolescent vein of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""Saw"" or other similar films. It is violent in a realistic manner that counterbalances the fantasy portion of the story in a non-gratuitous way. All the violent scenes are entirely appropriate to the telling of the story, although many of them are difficult to watch. What you won't see are fountains of gore and exploding body parts. The fact is that people don't explode in a burst of red mist when shot with a military-caliber luger. This is not cartoon/video game violence.The CGI is done in an understated way that enhances the realism of the movie, rather than detracting from it. This is probably the single best use of GGI that I have ever seen. You truly walk away wondering if much of what you just saw was actually real.I have read comments disdaining the creatures in this film, but I think these people have entirely missed the point. The fantasy scenes, although some of them are disturbing, are almost charming in their child-like simplicity. They are rooted in the fears and imagination of a young girl, not the jaded mind of an adult. As such, they are frightening only in a ""monster under the bed"" sort of way.Finally, I would encourage anyone who loves fantasy films to see Pan's Labyrinth. I would not recommend it for any child under the age of 16, though I think that only the most mature 16-year olds should see it. It is a thought-provoking film that will haunt you for days afterward.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
A young girl escapes a harsh world by entering a world of fantasy.,"it was fan-tas-tic! I truly loved the magical touch in this movie. The movie is actually a combination of 2 very strong stories; a fantasy journey and a rather brutal Spanish war. Both stories blend perfectly! The acting is very good, very natural and the Spanish language makes the fantastic characters sound like they speak enchanted dead languages (if you don't speak Spanish of course :o) It differentiates itself from other movies because of this because there are no cheesy ""i love you""-lines or tough American style WarHeroism-language.The magic isn't childish at all, it's more of a mature nature, very dark and can be very scary/spooky (like in Brothers Grimm). Believe me, Watch this movie, you WILL NOT REGRET IT. either if you like fantasy or a strong war-story, just let your eyes feast on this masterpiece.one of my all-time favorites.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
A beautiful but hard-biting portrait of a girl's mental escape from the Spanish Civil War,"Guillermo del Toro thinks his latest production to be his best to date, and perfectly describes it as ""a powerfully moving story, profoundly human and dramatic."" Throughout the film there is a contrast between the fairytale land that the young Ofelia is mixed up in and the brutal goings on of the Spanish Civil War that surround her. One minute fairies flutter around her face, and the next minute we see her step father - ""el capitán"" - shooting two suspected propagandists at point blank range. The acting is very powerful throughout, with the perfect balance of innocence and enquiry from young Ivana Baquero as Ofelia, and a very convincing 'baddie' in Sergi López's Capitán Vidal, seeming to show absolutely no love for anything or anyone, other than his future child who he is sure will be a son - when the doctor says that it is not certain the baby will be male, the Captain replies 'no me jodas' (don't f*** with me). The film is beautiful from start to finish, with CGI perfectly fusing with the real rural images of a lodge deep in the forest. The film uses the horrific nature of the war to give added power without becoming overly politicised, for which del Toro must be commended. Overall a fantastic piece of film-making, and I look forward to seeing it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
A Masterpiece!,"Once again Doug Jones delivers a spectacular performance as the Faun and Pale man. This movie was equally horrifying as well as enchanting. The makeup and costumes were superb. I've watched this movie many times, it's one you'll never forget.A little girl can see things that others can't and it makes more sense as to why as you continue to watch the movie. The ending was also phenomenal because it made you think. I was both sad and happy at the same time.My only gripe is that they refuse to Sub this in English, which is a bit ableist.

"Truly Gripping, Magical and Unexpectingly Brutal","Pan's Labyrinth is a truly gripping film. It shows the difference in class between the peasant resistance and the fascist military. It's a great blend of action and drama whilst managing to stay interesting to the audience. It combines history, fantasy, politics and a story into 2 hours of enthralling film. The setting is magical and transports you into a world of mystical delight.The costume and make up team really out do themselves, making the mythical creature of a Faun look real. It's not CGI or some animations; they took the time and effort to make a Greek god, only seen in paintings into a real life being.The Performance by Ivana Baquero is brilliant, especially as she was only 11 or 12 at the time. She has to act with CGI; she has to act scared, sad, happy, relieved and surprised. With such little experience puts on an incredible show. Also, the performance of Sergi Lopez is amazing. From the first time we meet him to the last he keeps his character, a character which is always by the book, cold hearted and emotionless, even towards a child.Before watching the film I expected a corny story with poor performance by the lead child actor. But I couldn't have been more wrong. Even though it's sounds all cheesy story, it's actually quite dark, brutal and thrilling. There's unexpected violence completely out of nowhere that surprises the audience and gives a true insight into what the character are like early on.Overall, Pan's Labyrinth is a must see block buster. Please do not discriminate it as it's foreign with subtitles, after a few minutes your used to it and hooked on its riveting tale.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Magic is in the world,"The thread of magical realities that can often be found in Spanish literature is on full display here. Other reviewers have wondered if Ofelia's world is real or not. The answer is, it doesn't matter. You're not going to get a neat answer to that, and it's a good thing.Historically, fauns and fairies are nature spirits and so it is here. The world outside of Vidal's mill is teeming with magical creatures, and also republican soldiers. The point here is that the woods - nature - are out of Vidal's control.The power Vidal wields is brutal and absolute, but only within the confines of the mill. The forest will take everything from him. His son, his stepdaughter, his command, and ultimately, his life.Ultimate, the message of the film is that nature is magical, and authoritarianism ultimately cannot stand against it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Great movie,I think that this is a great movie and It tries to send a message that in the hardest times you can always find a good place and your own fantasy world. When I first heard the title of this movie I thought it was going to be very bad and with no message but it tries to send a great message. The only thing I think was bad of the movie was the violence there was to much violence in the movie and I think that it should not be that much. Overall I think this is a great movie.,8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
In your hands is your destiny,"Director Guillermo del Toro outdid himself and created a film beyond any previous presentation. Although he purposely applied many layers both technologically and psychologically, the actual finished product is deeper and has many more facets. This could be the result of leaving loose ends and just implications. What looks like two stories is one story where one reality intertwines with another reality until they both merge.It is 1944 in Spain, five years after the Civil War, ten-year-old Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is going to meet her new stepfather Captain Vidal (Sergi López.) Vidal is a fascist pro-Franco officer. She is about to meet more than that as she encounters possible friends from another world. We also see how touchier and fantasy are juxtaposed. One of the major questions to answer is, are the magical creatures real and can only be seen because you have to have the right gaze, or are they figments?You will need to watch the movie several times to get the nuances and see the surrounding environments that you miss when concentrating on the dialog. See how the two world parallels in furniture. See out the two works hold similar tasks as both containing a key and a knife. Also, there are always more surprises waiting.The acting is superb especially Ofelia's death scene. Ivana Baquero Won, Imagen Award Best Actress, Premio ACE Best New Actress, Newcomer Award Female (Categoría Femenina), Turia Award New Best Actress, and Nominated, Young Artist Award Best Performance in an International Feature Film - Leading Young Actor or Actress.The Blu-ray version I watched had English subtitles as an option but I found them to be a tad inaccurate and wanting of some of the background conversations. However, the director's voice-over option helped point out the obvious that was not obvious until he pointed it out. As pointed out by the director, the violence was not for violence's sake in the story and they did not have cowboy type breakable props.This is one of the films that take good advantage of Blu-ray resolution and intensity.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
The Darkest Fairy Tale,"(SPOILERS) Pan's Labyrinth blew me away. Set during a Spanish Civil War, the setting often alternated between the horrors of reality and the fanciful wonderland that the young girl Ofelia, played by Ivana Baquero found herself in. After an encounter with a bipedal talking Faun played by Doug Jones who tells her she must complete 3 tasks before the next full moon in order to escape the mortal land and live with her father and mother who are royalty of the underworld. Each of these three tasks require Ofelia to venture away from her pregnant and sickly mother, played by Ariadna Gil and brutal step-father played by Sergi López to complete these tasks she receives from a magic book that the faun had given her.This movie was beautiful. Beautiful in the darkest of ways that I think I have seen put to film. A housemaid named Mercedes who essentially takes Ofelia under her wing has a lullaby that she hums to Ofelia at one point of the film. It is so simple and beautiful but very important to the film as you can hear it and its influence throughout the score of the film. The color pallet of the film is incredibly dark yet beautiful. The reality of the civil war ravaged area of Spain is constantly overcast and dark or rainy and each of the fantastical elements of the film are presented in the same type of light except I noticed that with each task Ofelia had to complete the composition of the shots became darker and darker as her situations became more and more dire. This darkness continues until the incredibly bright, bittersweet climax of the film. Innocence of person seems to be the central theme of this movie. Ofelia is thrust into a world she wanted nothing to do with. Her mother becomes pregnant and moves to the compound where the Captain Vidal and the men he commands over reside. He is a terrible, brutal man. Vidal is perhaps one of the most brutal and frightening antagonists I have ever seen in a film. He treats Ofelia and her mother like objects while only caring about his son (the baby that the mother Carmen is pregnant with). He takes no prisoners except to torture and maim them before killing them when he receives what he wants. Ofelia stands to be the central figure of innocence throughout a war where both sides are killing each other or backstabbing each other. Ofelia's innocence is brought to light in many instances throughout the film until the climax when the Faun requires the blood of an Innocent to open a portal back to Ofelia's true royal family.This movie was very different than your standard ""Innocence triumphs"" type film. No one is sacred or untouchable in this movie and it shows throughout. While a movie such as E.T. has a bitter sweet ending and the innocent child risks his life to save another certainly could be paid tribute here in Pan's Labyrinth, I feel it is taken to an extreme showing the horrors of experiencing a war as a child from the frontlines. Motifs in which Ofelia's innocence are tested throughout the film. There are moments when her character traits put those around her in danger because she didn't consider her acts to be ""That bad"" and in the ultimate test of innocence she sacrificed herself for her brother ultimately earning her way from her mortal body to reclaim her spot as princess in the underworld with her mother and father. This film truly shows a strong innocent character in Ofelia. She was brave until the end and while the film seemed to leave the ending up to the viewer I like to believe that it was truly a bittersweet ending when the credits rolled. A dark and twisted fairy tale, Pan's Labyrinth was great and highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
A masterpiece,"This movie is a Mexican-Spanish co-production and in my opinion a Guillermo Del Toro 's masterpiece. If we defined a masterpiece as a content or form who finds an adequate expression in an art form then this movie is one . There are so many things to talk about but let's start with the photography that have an outstanding quality , it's almost like paintings . The screenplay unite 2 separate worlds , the world of fantasy and the post war era in Spain in a very wise way. Being Spanish myself I recognize many of the things the screenplay talks about . The actors and actresses do a once in a lifetime performances , for me this movie is a casting miracle . Ivana Baquero, Maribel Verdú ( in a performance full of dignity and courage), Sergi Lopez ( his fascist is a terrible character but he gives him humanity ).The music score by Javier Navarrete is full of subtle details and good orchestration .And the movie never takes the easy way , it's full of logic and good storytelling .

Visual Poetry,"Very early in this film, I formed an interpretation which I believe to be completely correct, and borne out by the plot, details, and symbolism in the film. I will not share that interpretation here. All that I will say about it is that despite knowing where the film would end up and why, I thoroughly enjoyed the journey, and was surprised by many aspects of the film along the way.Written and directed by rising Mexican directorial star Guillermo Del Toro, Pan's Labyrinth is set in Spain during the Franco years. The story's heroine is a young girl named Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and the story is told mostly from her perspective. Ofelia lives in two worlds, the miserable abomination that Spain has become under fascist control, and a world of magic in which she has learned that she may just be a reincarnated princess who has to undergo a series of trials posed by the faun 'Pan' prior to being reunited after several hundred years with her father, the king. These two worlds come together at several points in the narrative, where Ofelia needs the magic of Pan's world to resolve problems in her other realm.Ofelia's other realm is populated by her pregnant mother, who is the only parent she has known, her reluctantly adoptive father (the father of the child her mother is to bear), who is a fascist commanding an outpost in which they reside. There are several other prominent characters including members of a resistance movement a caring housekeeper and a doctor employed by the fascists.The acting is all excellent, especially the heavy (Sergi Lopez), Ofelia, and Mercedes the housekeeper (Maribel Verdu). But the story and the exceptional fluidity with which the camera and sound tell it are the real stars here. There are no wasteful scenes in this film though, to be sure there are some painful and disturbing ones.Although I have enjoyed some of Del Toro's work previously, this is the most serious, intense, and well made film I have thus far seen from him. Everything about this perfectly coherent film works, from both an aesthetic and practical point of view. Pan's Labyrinth has reached my top 5 for 2006.Very highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Never Escapes From The Fact It's Two Entirely Separate Stories,"PAN'S LABYRINTH was just about the most critically acclaimed release of 2006 . While it was better than most of the films nominated for the Best Picture Oscar - can anyone remember THE QUEEN or BABEL ? - it suffered badly from the hype and acclaim that surrounded it . Watching it not long after its release I did get a feeling of slight disappointment of "" Is that it ? "" . Sometimes it's best to let the passage of time elapse before you give your honest opinion on a movie Eight years after its release now seems like a long enough time to see if it's as good as it was made outThere's no doubt PL is a strangely beautiful and haunting film . There is a major problem and that is that it never really escapes from the feel that it's two separate stories connected in a rather tenuous way . Ofelia lives in Franco's falangist , fascist Spain of 1944 and is made to live with her stepfather , the brutal sadistic Captain Vidal who holds the surrounding area in an iron fist . Ofelia , a child about to enter adolescence soon stumbles upon a strange underground kingdom populated by faries and demons and soon finds this magical kingdom can be every bit as cruel and oppressive as the war ridden and chaotic world of 1944Time to be a little bit controversial and state despite the idiosyncratic visual magic that Del Toro brings to his films by the far the best aspect is the real life horrors inflicted upon the human population of a fascist country and the fantasy elements seem to be included as a sort of gimmick , almost as if Del Toro thought a period drama would have no market outside of Spain . Every time the action cut to the underground fantasy a voice inside my head - no doubt the director - kept saying "" Please give me an Oscar for costume design , make up and visual effects por favor "" . When you've got an evil piece of work like Captain Vidal murdering people who needs made up monsters ?If we're talking about Oscar nominations let's talk about Sergi Lopez as Vidal , or rather let's talk about one of the biggest Oscar snubs in history that's up there with Bruno Ganz in DER UNTERGANG . Seems if someone plays a murderous right winger this seems to alienate the award voters almost as if they're seen condoning mass murder . I'm of the view that a film is only as good as its villain and they don't much better than Vidal , a man who is more than happy to return to the family table after executing a couple of suspected rebels as if nothing out of the ordinary has happened . This reflects the Latin attitude of fascism . South American countries were notorious for this in the 1970s and 80s but even as recently as the 1970s Spain had a rather poor human rights record under Franco . Indeed I once worked with a Spanish waitress called Maria who told me her grandparents were murdered by Franco's regime . I never found out if it was because they were leftists or because they were descended from people who killed Jesus but it was a very poignant reminder that fascism in Europe didn't end with the defeats of Germany and Italy in 1945As it stands PAN'S LABYRINTH is a strange but captivating movie . It's not quite a fairy tale and it's not quite a historical drama . It's contains wonderful performances and yet it's probably not the masterwork some people claim it to be . It never manages to overcome the inherent problem of being two stories trying and failing to gel together which means it's a good film but not a brilliant one",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Brutal and beautiful,"This movie creates a fairy tale out of the Spanish Civil War, and it has much in common with traditional fairy tales (and with Life is Beautiful now that I think about it). Anyway, the imagination of a little girl in war torn Spain sure is a good way to quickly transition between extreme violence and whimsical beauty. Not a scene is wasted here. Everything each character does tells us something about that character, or tells us something about the naïveté/innocence of the world through a child's eyes. The design of the whimsical characters is inspired, and of course that eyeball guy is just so devastatingly scary! The scariest thing in the whole movie, though, is a man trying to live up to a legacy of violence. Seeing someone's face get bashed in by the villain for absolutely no reason tells us all we need to know about who the real monsters are. This is a great use of characterization, and in the first act, nonetheless. This is a beautiful movie with extreme violence and sad themes about war and power, but still beautiful.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

From the imagination of Guillermo Del Toro,"Guillermo Del Toro is Mexican. I clarify this because I know it, and I assured the fact to a friend who watched ""El laberinto del fauno"" with me; but when the movie began with a Spanish accent, I doubted. And it's because Del Toro is obsessed with the Spanish Civil War, and we the adventures of little children in the midst of this important historical event (watch ""El espinazo del Diablo""); but all of this comes from his obsession with fairy tales, those that are only for children.But look at what he does: he invents the most infantile story of all, in a film that's everything except infantile. This is a double-edged sword; in fact, Del Toro is a double-edged sword himself. His obsessions come from when he was little, when he imagined creatures and monsters as part of his daily reality. He also has a photographic memory; these are all things that can as positive as they can be negative, and it is evidenced in his way of making cinema.The man knows a lot about cinema: he has experimented with cameras since his teenage years; he studied make-upThis plays against him too, mostly in ""El laberinto del fauno"", which is one of the most technically perfect movies I've seen in my whole life. The impressive sound edition becomes present from the first minute; the images are exaggeratedly beautiful; the music is perfect, but only because it is directly connected to the plot.All the particularities that can be found in this film's characters come straight from Del Toro; who wrote the screenplay of his fable himself. It is an enchanting script that commences with the telling of a simple fairy tale, revealing a main fact of the story immediately. We should remember something so fundamental, but this immersing quality of the script makes us forget. And it's not a complex screenplay, because it has its predictable points; but as we get lost in a world where reality and fantasy become one, we stop caring.Reality can be so strong that sometimes we choose to escape. The images of this film are very strong, therefore the main character, Ivana, finds a magical world that keeps her constantly away from what's happening around her. And the point is not to ask ourselves if this 'magical world' is real, trying to analyze every moment to put them together and see if they fit. That's unimportant, because in this story there's nothing to resolveBut there's a lot to understand.And I think that to really understand ""El laberinto del fauno"", you hace to understand its director. Del Toro's ability to bring incredible creations (from the same 'faun' to a monster with eyes in its hands) to us reflects the power of his imagination; maybe his only neutral quality. I think I'll never completely understand Del Toro, but I assume that his imagination is what makes him attractive to the people who work with him; and consequently makes them follow him anywhere.In this aspect, ""El laberinto del fauno"" stands close to ""Letters From Iwo Jima""; because just like Clint Eastwood in that film, Del Toro is an example of how crucial and predominant is the influence of the director in a cinematographic piece. ""El laberinto"" is excessively long, but nobody cared; the actors become insignificant, as if the characters had taken over them (and not the other way round as it should be)Everything seems to be part of a bigger unit: Guillermo Del Toro's vision.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

Pan's Labyrinth: The Fairy Tale of the Decade,"Yes, this movie is a fairy tale. Yes, it deals with fairies, fauns, and ogres, with magic spell books and princesses. No, this movie is not at all for children nor those who dislike major violence.Labyrinth takes place in Spain in 1944s, during a time of Spanish civil war. A ruthless Captain (Sergi López), has set up camp in a distant forest, and requests that his pregnant step-wife (Ariadna Gil) and her fantasy-obsessed daughter, Ofelia (brilliantly played by Ivana Baquero) join him there. As she tries to adjust to the country life smack dab in the middle of the battlefield, Ofelia runs into a magical fairy who leads her to a mystical labyrinth, where she meets a mysterious and suspicious faun, Pan (wonderfully played by Doug Jones), who tells her that she is the long-lost princess of an underground kingdom, and that she must complete three dangerous tasks to return to her throne.While the movie closely follows Ofelia's tasks, spoken to her by a magic book from Pan, it is mostly about the war, double agents (Maribel Verdú and Álex Angulo), and the Captain's near-obsession with his expected son. The battles are extremely brutal (starting early with a couple of rabbit hunters) and made me queazy a couple of times. So brutal are these deaths, in fact, that you'll be relieved to see a simple shot to the head or back.The acting is top-notch, and young Ivana Baquero has a huge and brilliant future ahead of her (picture Dakota Fanning, only a better actress and less annoying). The animation is phenomenal, but not nearly as breathtaking as the costumes or scenery. The labyrinth itself just sucks all the breath out of you when you see it at night for the first time. The ""pale man"" (also played by Doug Jones), is by far the most terrifying creature in the movie, most-likely to give even the most mature and grown-up adults shivers.Yes, this movie does have sub-titles (it's in Spanish), but it's hardly noticeable at first, so much so that you forget about them by the tragic end of the movie.This movie is frightening and sad to the extreme, but it also gives you a sense of hope that magic does, in fact, exist.

A Beautiful Film that must be seen!,"I am not going to write a lengthy review. Needless to say I agree with 90% of the positive reviews I have read on this site. This is a fantastic film, a pure vision of del Toro's passion for the story. Del Toro again makes a film intended solely for us, the viewers, to enjoy and admire. If more directors shared this same philosophy, there would not be nearly as many cookie cutter and plain awful movies churned out for the Hollywood bean counters year after year.I mainly am writing this review in response to the negative reviews on this site I purposely read. I found that in all the negative reviews, there was one common factor, all the people who hated the movie were people who had no idea what they were going to see. it's time to educate everyone:1. This movie is not a kids movie. Do not bring them. Leave them home with a babysitter.2. This movie is not all a fairy tale. It is set in fascist Spain after the Spanish Civil War, not completely in a magical world of make believe.3. This movie is violent. If you are offended by blood and realistic, non cartoony violence, stay home with the kids and babysitter.4. Don't go see this movie just because you are trying to keep up with the Joneses. Watch the full trailer, visit the website, read this review and others. EDUCATE yourself before blindly going into this or any other movie then leaving upset because it was not what you thought it was.The bottom line is, this is a beautiful film that you must see if you enjoy seeing directors put all their passion into a film. If you are tired of typical, tired, paint by numbers Hollywood films(I'm looking at you Shymalan, Soderbergh) then run out and see this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Guillermo's best movie...,"I was waiting this movie for a few months, and finally last week I saw it and I must to tell that all waiting worth it. It's a wonderful ""fairy tale"", with great performances (specially from Ivana Baquero), the setting, visual FX and all you can see in the screen is just great. This is a very touching story, and shows us an alternative reality in a world being destroying by hate, and this other ""reality"" is perhaps what we're looking for, inside of us, to keep a little faith. I hope you can enjoy this film as much as I did, because so long ago I haven't so much inspiration from a movie as I did with this one, it touched the little girl inside me, and all I can do is to bless our amazing ability to dream.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Brutal and lovely. Perfect! Its dramatic intensity will stun you!,"I believed them on 'Front Row', on BBC Radio 4, when they said this was a tremendous 'fairy tale' for adults. They also said it was NOT in any way, shape, or form for children. They were right. It does, indeed, hearken back to the original Brothers Grimm, and the older form of fairy tale, which was violent and very intense. Contrast this with the dumbed-down nursery tales pumped out by virtually everybody else, especially Disney.Disney fairy tale stuff is fine for 3 to 8 year-olds. And they do some great movies for adults, too. But Disney's over-sanitized cutsie-a-thons even troubled me as a child. My dad gave me the book 'Pinochio', published ca. 1900, when I was 10. It was a long, brutal, and scary story, very exciting and satisfying. Nothing like the treacle the Disney movie dished up to us. This is not to beat up Disney--- they do fine work, for what it is: morally ambiguous, maudlin, saccharine tales suitable for the uncritical. But do, do, DO understand that this movie is as far from anything Disney has ever even contemplated as possible. This is not for kids. It is for you. It is deep, serious, and as thrilling and exciting as any war movie, murder mystery, or family drama you'll ever see.I was intrigued throughout, and uplifted and gratified by the end. Clearly, this spectacular beauty is a masterpiece! I gave it a well deserved 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Masterpiece... NO buts.,"Film's like Pan's Labyrinth only come once in a decade! This film is absolutely wonderful. It is a fantasy/fairy tale drama set during the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War at the end of world war 2. The central character is a little girl played by the subtle Ivana Baquero, but it is not a kids film. It is very violent and is bereft of ANY compassion. What is gained from all the violence is a strong metaphorical answer towards the 'real world' and the 'fantasy world' which the lead character is slowly led into. The films central explorations are hope, redemption, sacrifice, faith, fate and what answers lie beyond life itself. Yet, it is not an escape into a fantasy world.The set designs and costumes are outstanding. Doug Jones does a brilliant job of bringing Fauno and Pale Man to life. But the real star is Guillermo del Toro. With his great vision and excellent story telling, he brings the entire film to life. He knows exactly what fans want and works brilliant towards genre.This is a flawless film.""It is not a matter of agreeing or disagreeing. I've got to the point where it IS the Citizen Kane of fantasy movies. As soon as ANYONE says BUT, I don't want to hear it. It's like looking at the Mona Lisa and saying ""yeah, it's alright, gotta bit of a wonky smile"" NO... NO... NO!! It is a masterpiece"" - To that I agree and so should everyone else who watches this film.I can not praise this film enough. It is almost impossible to explain the experience. You have to see it for yourself. Especially with poor fantasy/fairy tale films that we've received this year and last year (Chronicles of Narnia), this should bring back hope towards cinema in everyone.If there is only 1 film you watch this year, watch Pan's Labyrinth.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
"Dark, Sad and Cruel Fairytale in Times of War and Repression","In 1944, in the post-Civil War in Spain, rebels still fight in the mountains against the fascist troops. The young and imaginative Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) travels with her pregnant and sick mother Carmen Vidal (Ariadna Gil) to the country to meet and live with her stepfather, the sadistic and cruel Captain Vidal (Sergi López), in an old mill. During the night, Ofelia meets a fairy and together they go to a pit in the center of a maze where they meet a faun that tells that she is a princess from a kingdom in the underground. He also tells that her father is waiting for her, but she needs to accomplish three gruesome, tough and dangerous assignments first. Meanwhile, she becomes friend of the servant Mercedes (Maribel Verdú), who is the sister of one of the rebels and actually is giving support to the group. In a dark, harsh and violent world, Ofelia lives her magical world trying to survive her tasks and sees her father and king again.""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is among the best movies I have ever seen, with a fantastic, but very sad, pessimist and violent story, supported by magnificent and powerful characters, wonderful art work, cinematography, soundtrack and make-up. The story takes place in a very difficult period of the Spanish history, the post-Civil War with the victory of Franco. Ofelia, an intelligent girl that loves fairy tales and misses her father, creates an imaginary world to survive to the difficulties of the real world, living the fantasy as escapism. It is interesting to see that even her fantasy is creepy and dark. Her mother Carmen, played by the stunning Ariadna Gil, is a very weak and submissive widow, without expressing her opinion, who probably has suffered many difficulties to raise her daughter without a husband in such difficult times. On the opposite side, the wonderful Maribel Verdú plays Mercedes, a woman full of power and idealism, capable to humiliate herself to achieve her objectives. The outstanding Sergi López (the unforgettable Harry) plays one of the most despicable villains I have ever seen, a cruel, arrogant and evil man that shows no respect for anybody. There is a violent scene that is a rip-off of ""Irréversible"", when Captain Vidal hits the hunter in his nose with a bottle. This masterpiece is certainly the best work of the director Guillermo del Toro, from the excellent ""El Espinazo del Diablo"".

This movie SUCKED,"I have seen all bad movies lately, even two yesterday and today and this was the third. Possibly it was the worst of the three of them. It's a weird film about a little kid who finds a secret world in Spain or Mexico and her mother's sick. Her father is a bad soldier who kills people in a war that is happening in the real world, although not in the secret world she finds.I thought it was rubbish. It made me uncomfortable, like peanut butter slapped on my head or eating too much spicy lamb. The so-called special effects were not-so-special and didn't look realistic. At times I even thought the film would overheat! LOL Or cause a combustion LOL",,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
6 on a scale of 10,"I simply can't see what all the fuss is about regarding this movie. There have been hundreds of more violent movies. There have been dozens of more magical movies. There have been tens of better war movies.What's more, there was very little, if any, character development. We were sympathetic to the child, but pretty much couldn't care less about any of the other participants. All of them were disposable.I don't like subtitles, but I can live with them and decided not to penalize the movie for them. But, given the choice, it's a no-brainer.The biggest problem with the movie is simple. It's the ketchup and ice cream analogy. Both are good, but they suck together. Here is a war movie with a child who lives in a fantasy world - presumably in order to escape her terrible surroundings. The fantasy was fairly interesting. The war was fairly interesting. Putting both together in the same movie is ketchup and ice cream. It is irrelevant to me that the reason the fantasy even exists is because of the war. The fact is, they don't mesh well in a movie. But, I will admit, that's just my opinion. Someone else may find the exist together just fine.Len",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
"dark, twisted, sublime, wondrous and excellently made. This is a triumph of modern cinema.","All your emotions will be thoroughly tested in Guillermo Del Toro's grim fairy tale. A masterful fable that alternates between uber-gritty realism and dark, twisted fantasy with such a sublime slickness, it is near startling. A young woman by the name of Ofelia has just moved to rural Spain, with her sick, pregnant mother where her new husband, the slimy fascist Captain Vidal is currently holding his troops. Constantly under fire from partisan soldiers in the wooden hills, Vidal must attend to his wife whilst fighting for Franco's regime. Ofelia, meanwhile, is caught in a struggle to escape the grim realities of war-torn Spain. She is in love with stories, notably her fairy tales. One night, she is visited by a fairy, which brings her to the ""labyrinth"". A secret maze, run by a tall, tree-like faun. He calls her ""your highness"" and a princess, and gives her tasks to complete for him, each one adding a new page to her empty fairytale book.Whilst from a distance Pan's Labyrinth may seem like a children's grim fairytale, it is anything but for children. The majority of the movie is far more concerned with Captain Vidal and his horrendous callousness to both his wife, his people and to the Spanish resistance. In a film that features a skinless monster with eyes in his hands, slowly creeping towards Ofelia as she avoids becoming the rancidly gravel-voiced demon's next dinner meal, Vidal is by far the most putrid thing on screen. A man who fears dreamers and thinkers, one of who just happens to be the innocent Ofelia. Her mother doesn't understand, nor does the Captain. It seems the only people she can turn to are the shrewd resistance-sympathising maid Mercedes (Maribel Verdu, of Y Tu Mama Tambien fame) and the faun himself.Do not be fooled. This is a movie about children, but not for children. There are at least two torture sequences, which despite being purely simplistic are every bit as masochistic as Saw or Casino Royale. The themes dealt with in Pan's Labyrinth are simple, yet adult ones, managing to mesh the contrast between fantasy and reality to startling effect. Every bit as wonderful and awe-inspiring as it is grim and melancholic  you will be hard-pressed to find a better film this year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

Disappointing,"I honestly do not understand why this film is receiving rave reviews everywhere. The story is simplistic. The only ambiguity is whether or not the girl is actually seeing fantastical creatures or is simply escaping the harsh realities of fascist Italy via her imagination. The acting is wooden; the characters, largely stereotypes. It is also a brutal film that is far too gory for children. So who is the intended audience? As for the special effects, they were imaginative but relatively infrequent. This was a movie that had lots of potential to which it simply did not live up. Apparently having subtitles and a different ""feel"" from the typical Hollywood film is enough to get rave reviews these days. Very disappointing.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Not for children,"Pan's Labrynth deserves a spot as one of the greatest movies of all time, in and outside of its genre.Many hearing of the movie's plot, its involvement with mythical creatures and a magical world through a child's eyes, might confuse this for a family fairy tale; I think, at times, I might have preferred that.In actuality, Pan's Labrynth borders on horror. Ivana Baquero plays a young girl named Ophelia who struggles through a life rapidly spiraling out of control, one she as a child cannot influence. A sickly mother, a brutal step-father, and amidst a war in literally her own backyard, one can't help but sympathize with Ophelia's desire to escape. She finds just that opportunity within an entity, the Faun, straight out of the fairytale books she carries about with her. The Faun himself seems frightening, almost demonic, with a snake-like tongue that leaves you unsure of whether his requests of the girl are truly in her best interest.Ophelia, desperate to escape into a world so like the fairy tales she's read, sets off through dangerous territories as the Faun's request. Yet, as dangerous as her quests are, her return home becomes a gradual descent into the brutal darkness of her own human people, leaving one to question just who is the real monster in the movie.In the end, it all seems very bitter; it starts to seem that no one really cared about Ophelia to begin with. I found myself so wrapped into the movie that I felt my own heart-breaking despair. I kept hoping it would suddenly get better, that someone would rescue Ophelia and protect her from the darkness encroaching from every corner.It's hard to say whether Pan's Labrynth truly had a happy ending. Losing the people who meant most to her, one was left behind, one last person who cared, and it seems no one in this story leaves without their wounds. The entire movie, from beginning to end, tugs at the darkest despair and deepest sadness you could only hope to avoid, with every happy moment tinged with poignancy.I think, all in all, this is a very adult movie that a family can enjoy with some serious parental guidance; the horrors within are as fascinating as the wonders to come. The top-notch acting will draw you in and hold you despite any language barrier (cleverly overcome with subtitles) and when it's finally over, it's hard not to feel the shame, anger, and triumph, as if the trials were yours alone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Beautifully haunting masterpiece,"It seems as if it was just yesterday when a young Mexican director named Guillermo Del Toro sold his house in order to get enough money to complete his first feature length movie, ""Cronos"". Now, more than 10 years later, Guillermo Del Toro finally has created what many (himself included) call ""his masterpiece"", and to the surprise of many, they are not wrong. ""El Laberinto Del Fauno"", Del Toro's 6th movie, is truly a wonderful film deeply rooted in the director's favorite genres: horror and fantasy. A modern fairytale, ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is a remarkable achievement that probably, is just the beginning of a new stage in this courageous and imaginative director.Set in Spain in 1944, five years after the end of the Spanish Civil War, ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is the story of Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), a young girl who travels with her mother (Ariadna Gil) to a rural area to meet her mother's new husband, the Captain Vidal (Sergi López). But Ofelia is not very happy with her mother's decision, as the Captain is a very strict and evil man who serves Franco's fascist regime and enjoys to hunt the remaining rebel forces. In the middle of this post-war nightmare, Ofelia finds an ancient labyrinth that is the path to a magical world of faeries and monsters.In ""El Laberinto Del Fauno"", Del Toro once again dives into the fantastic genres he loves so much, this time exploring the nature of fairy tales, taking them back to its original roots, when fantasy tales were grim, dark and violent. The contrast between the post-war scenery and the fantastic world Ofelia is about to enter is just the first display of the duality motif, constantly present through the film. However, this is more complex than a mere ""good versus evil"" tale, it's about Ofelia's quest for her place in a world filled with the chaos and confusion of war. Deconstructing the hero's journey, Del Toro takes Ofelia through the classic outline of the three tasks she must complete to be able to enter the fantasy realm, with the Faun (Doug Jones) acting as judge and guide.Visually, Del Toro's film is captivating and filled with a dark beauty that is both frightening and attractive. While the fantastic world Ofelia enters is considerably different than her reality, it's by no means less haunting, as it's also a violent world with scary monsters that may reflect the harsh reality of the post-war Spain. With many themes borrowed from Spain's folklore, ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is very fresh and Del Toro's direction shows a maturity not seen before. One can only wonder what's next for the Mexican director as this film is easily his best film to date.The cast is simply excellent, starting with the young Ivana Baquero, who delivers a believable performance as Ofelia, carrying the film with power and making a very likable main character. However, the best performance comes from Sergi López, as the ruthless Captain Vidal. At first sight it may look as another typical villain, but López adds a lot of soul to a character that easily could had been a two-dimensional caricature in less talented hands. Maribel Verdú is also quite effective as Mercedes, a young woman who works as a servant and becomes Ofelia's only friend. She shows a lot of emotions in a character specially complex due to her role in the story. Doug Jones plays Pan, the Faun, delivering a very expressive performance under the heavy make-up he had to wear, making an interesting character even more mysterious than he already is. Finally, Álex Angulo and Ariadna Gil complete the cast with effective performances, although I found Gil a bit annoying. Angulo was simply excellent in a subtle low-key role.""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is a movie that easily could had been a predictable fantasy tale like the rest, but Del Toro constructs a movie that, while clearly follows and respects the fairytale pattern, it's never boring or tiresome, and in fact it keeps increasing its haunting beauty to the unforgettable last frame. Some have criticized the apparently biased way Del Toro presents the Spanish Civil War, but personally, I think that he makes sure to show that, no matter what side you are, in war the ones that lose the most are the children. While the movie is of course very violent, I think the ""R"" rating is really unnecessary, as in the end, real fairy tales used to be that way too.In the end, ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is a very moving film, moving back and forth between the horror and fantasy realms with ease creating a dark world that may just be a reflection of our own violent reality. Beautifully haunting, ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is a movie that can't be missed. 10/10. A Masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
The worst Del Toro so far,"This is no doubt the worst movie by Del Toro so far, no matter what other people have said. The plot is simply ridiculously unbelievable, especially if you know a thing or two about recent Spanish history and are not caught in ideological mousetraps. The plot is similar to Del Toro's ""El Espinazo del Diablo"" (2001), but unfortunately it is much weaker. In fact, the viewer will not understand the plot at all unless he or she is mired in a certain ideology which Del Toro apparently shares with his leading actors. The absurdities and historical inaccuracies (especially those concerning Captain Vidal) are too gross and too abundant to list here, and the result is one of the most biased movies I have ever seen.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
"Beautifully told, half fairy tale, half tragic reality","The fairy tale aspects of ""Pan's Labyrinth"" resemble somewhat Lewis's ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" in that there is a fantasy world one steps into and out of from a ""real"" world. But the film of ""...the Wardrobe's"" book was not the work of CS Lewis but of a translator (into film).IMO ""Pan's Labyrinth"" has FAR more power and I suspect much of that comes because it is the director's (del Toro) fairy tale and his conception and realization was always in the grammar and syntax of film. Probably, for that reason, it is an EXTREMELY powerful, unforgettable presentation.Some will despise it while many others will value it, often for similar reasons: there is not a single message or a single point of view. The film can be viewed from almost equally valid contrasting positions -- one, that the fairy tale aspects are a young girl's fantasy life boat she creates to escape a harsh, uncomfortable world. The other is that her fantasy world DOES have a reality and life of its own.There is ample evidence distributed throughout for both points of view.HELPFUL HISTORICAL POINTS: The time is 1944, shortly after the end (1939) of the last Spanish Civil War which was won by the fascist dictator, Gen. Francisco Franco, head of the Spanish army in Spanish Morocco. His fight and rise to power was supported by many factions: the Catholic church, many wealthy Spaniards, and other factions. Franco's bloc was opposed by the existing government (a republic) and a coalition of other factions with opposing agendas (such as decreasing the strong influences of the Catholic Church and the wealthy upper class, etc.).Several autocratic regimes gave Franco support: Hitler and Mussolini sent tanks, dive bombers, and troops, flouting League of Nations efforts to keep others from intervening. Spain became Hitler's laboratory for his later Wermacht tactics. Socialists, communists, and anti-fascists in many countries provided volunteer soldiers to help the republic; the Abraham Lincoln brigade was composed of Americans who volunteered to fight fascism.Franco's forces made deliberate efforts to crush equally all opposition and non-supporters by brutality, coercion, atrocities. The actions in this film deal with residual rebel forces unwilling to concede defeat.I have no idea how representative Capitan Vidal's actions and attitudes would be for Spain in 1944, five years after the Civil war's end but they are symbolic of the approach used by Franco forces during the war (and possibly also by many of those who opposed him, maybe in retaliation? or maybe not?).The photography, music, visualizations, directing, casting and acting are superb. It's said at Cannes the film received a 22 minute ovation; IMO every second was deserved.There are some scenes of graphic torture that I could not bear to see and had to position my hands in front of my eyes so I could still read the subtitles while blocking the rest of the screen.THIS IS NOT A FILM FOR CHILDREN. It is both a history lesson and a fairy tale for adults.The preteen girl in the part of Ofelia is outstanding and carries a film that needs no carrying. The other main characters were also excellent -- Capitan Vidal, Carmen (his new wife), Mercedes (house manager & rebel), the doctor, and the Faun/Pale Man.IF you can appreciate ambiguity in the dividing line between fantasy and reality -- and competing interpretations, IF you can tolerate holding up your hands to block acts of cruelty from your eyes, SEE IT -- it's destined to be an iconic classic.BUT IF that sort of thing isn't your cup of tea, save your time and money, see something else -- and don't diss this for being something it isn't.FWIW/FYI: at this time, with 19,000+ votes, over 85% rated ""PL"" as a 10, 9, or 8; fewer than 5% rated it 5 or lower.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

Of course, all this violence is proported to have some sort of meaning, as in, ""see how cruel people are too each other"". But to me, the movie came across as, ""see how much we think you want to watch people being cruel too each other and then we'll come up with a nice theme about how people are so cruel so that you can feel good about our movie's sadism."" Apart from that, I can't say that is was a bad movie, just not something that I care to see.

24 Hours Later ... Still Not Sure What to Make of It,"It's been over 24 hours since I saw Pan's Labyrinth at the local Googleplex. I'm still not sure if I liked it or not. I'm giving it a good grade (8 out of 10) because it is wonderfully shot, and has great art direction, cinematography, and set design. It's also very well acted and directed, and it's not pretentious or overbearing or simplistic or goofy.I guess it just didn't connect with me, like it's apparently connected with thousands and thousands of true fans. I'll try to describe the reasons why in a couple of paragraphs, but I doubt they'll be able to capture my antipathy properly.First, this isn't really an ""adult fantasy film"" as some have ascribed. It really is about kids, namely a girl who's stuck in a horrible position (forced to live with the cruel captain who married her mother). The film shows how kids in terrible situations can often mentally retreat into various fantasies, in this case a realm of fauns and fairies. So why did they give it an ""R"" rating and market it to adults? They should have cut down the violence a bit (it's not gratuitous, the extra notch of ""R"" rated violence doesn't markedly propel the plot) and gone for a PG-13 rating. This way, it would have been actually directed at kids (albeit older ones).As a reference point, consider what Stephen Spielberg did with his classic ""Empire of the Sun."" That, too, is a story about a kid caught in terrible circumstances (namely imprisonment in Japanese-held China during WWII). That was a PG-13 film, and shot through the eyes of the child, instead of through the eyes of the adults around the child. Something about ""Pan's Labyrinth"" doesn't ring true because of this. We're seeing a young girl's fantasies, but we are constantly torn back to an adult viewpoint. As a result, we never see this young girl grow and understand (and the evolution of a character is a prime force in cinema). If the director had kept us looking through her eyes, our sympathy for the character would be larger.I think that last paragraph was quite convoluted, so I'll try to re-phrase the main problem of this film. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" does not maintain the cohesive point of view throughout the film. Is this film about a bad world shown through the eyes of a child, or is it a film about the fantasies of a child shown through the lens of the real world? It's this lack of viewpoint cohesion that leaves me cold.8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

I need a bath,"This movie is horrendous. Incredibly violent without even the coherence of Quentin Tarentino, I'm disgusted that I wasted money on it. The violence is graphic, gratuitous, and frequent. (The LA Times reviewer who claims that the violence gives us something to fear is completely off the mark. This isn't violence cleverly used to instill fear, it's just pushing buttons. Apparently Del Toro thinks that to create a real sense of fear you crush somebody's face with a beer bottle...a scene btw that is in the first 10 minutes of the movie, and fully rendered on camera...). To add insult to injury, the story is simplistic, unsophisticated, uninteresting, and ultimately boring. Sadly, if you've seen the trailer you've pretty much seen all the images worth seeing.

A masterpiece in every aspect,"Up to this film, there was quite good enough evidence about the talent of Guillermo Del Toro as a director. I'm pretty sure that he will keep on providing good work. But however, after seeing this movie, there's one new thing else that i'm sure of... He will never be able to create such a beautiful movie again. This is surely a masterpiece; and this is his masterpiece that will ruin the rest of his life with a huge cast of shadow. Just like the Brazil did and actually -still doing- on Gilliam.El Laberinto del Fauno is a very brutal and violent fairy tale that is carefully and masterfully scripted and directed, both by Del Toro. It can easily be compared to last year's Chronicles of Narnia, but unlike Narnia, this movie is very clear and consistent on its subject material. While Narnia departs from its initial offer, moving towards an exaggerated symbolism, therefore towards a childish fairy tale since the symbolism was far out of range to be meaningful, El Laberinto Del Fauno never looses its ties with reality. What this movie offers is a very hard to find combination of reality and disillusion, an impossible to find mixture of violence/brutality and humanism, and a one in a million possibility of innocence and guiltiness together, all eating from same can. These kind of combinations or pairs can only exist in one place: in a singular brain. And just like that, the movie chooses a perfect atmosphere for delivering the story: Civil War. A civil war (in this movie: Spanish civil war in fact) is like a self-arguing brain. The harshness of reality and the dosage of brutality is horribly high, so that we can easily and -willingly cross over to disillusion with Ophelia. So; This Labyrinth, may be a very valuable opening to your-our forgotten childhood.This is a perfect movie, the perfect fiction movie (that i haven't seen for years) and obviously the best 2006 movie. Everyone should see this fairy tale, but not the children, because of the brutality fact. There will be sure enough time for it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Wonderful,"My wife and I just got back from the showing at Hyde Park Picture House (Leeds) - first time i've been there and it was SO special. The cinema is one of those Ye Olde ones - single screen... tiny foyer with a small selection of food etc - beautiful decor and comfy seats - truly magical. We were sat up in the balcony and it was a fantastic experience.The movie has got to be one of the best films I have seen all year - such a breath of fresh air. The violence wasn't over the top and I am glad it was there as it showed cold brutality - along with the magical side too.The actors and actresses were all stars; delivering such powerful performances all round - you felt pity, resentment, hate and warmth. Completely different from almost all mainstream films.My wife was in tears at the end - because it was so wonderful, sad, tragic and powerful. It was SUCH a shame the cinema was pretty much empty and a majority of people will not be able to share if the beauty of this film.I so hope that America don't buy the rights to remake it in a few years time and have Steven Speilburg camp it up with silly little aliens. Leave it as is and it will one day be appreciated for what it was; a powerful, dark, beautiful fairy tale.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Amazing,"This film is outstanding. I went to see it last night after hearing a few very positive reviews and I was not disappointed. I am not a film buff and am not familiar with Guillermo del Toro's non-Hollywood films so didn't really know what to expect, but the director's imagination impressed me greatly.This is both one of the most beautiful and the most gruesome/chilling films I have ever seen. The contrast between this, and between Franco's Spain and the Labyrinth are breathtaking. Franco's Spain in itself is a great backdrop to the film as it doesn't tend to get much exposure to non-Spanish audiences. The labyrinth is a superb piece of fantasy, with amazingly creepy characters like the Faun and the creature with no eyes.The characters are all well-developed and excellent. The acting is also perfect, as is the music. I was deeply moved by this film and would recommend it to anyone, except children who will have nightmares for years. Do not be put off by the subtitles, as they are barely noticeable. I find it hard to believe how anyone on IMDb could give this film a score below 7/8, it is fantastic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
good job,"It is this kind of movies that makes life really something. There are always some excitements and joys awaiting us.I watched this movie last night, and I can't help to share my enjoyment with others. Life is complicated and mysterious. While most of us lead a desperate mundane life, it is still so.Like Whistler is reputedly the first painter to touch the nocturnal scenery, Del Toro explores the heart of the dark.Truman Capote's novels are classified into two categories: day settings and nocturnal settings.In the latter, it is the world of mysteries, it is the world of human hearts. and in this movie Del Toro entwines the two into a piece. hail to genius!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
"Not the best film of 2006 by a long shot, but so close...","It seems ironic that the films considered by many to be the best films of the previous year are both set in an episode of history long since past, but should never be forgotten. El Laberinto Del Fauno only misses out on being the best film of 2006 because Zwartboek took so awfully long to enter production, but its virtues exceed its faults by such a long way that it will always be a benchmark in storytelling. When I say it is based to a great degree on ancient fairy tales such as those written by the Grimm Brothers, it would be all too easy to mistake El Laberinto Del Fauno for being aimed at children. And that would be selling it oh so very short. Like all of the fairy tales that have been bastardised into something puerile by Disney, El Laberinto Del Fauno is a story that every adult should learn from. Children will be frightened and saddened by it, but intelligent or hyperlexic children (or both, such as I was), will get far more out of it than the G-rated tosh that they seem to expect intelligent children to enjoy nowadays.Set in a remote farm outpost in Spain during the Civil War, a forgotten episode in what is indisputably the darkest days of the twentieth century, El Laberinto Del Fauno concerns itself with one extremely dysfunctional family. The mother has just married a Captain of the Spanish army, an incredibly evil man who is without redeeming feature. It is amazing to see another film in the vein of RoboCop, Total Recall, or Zwartboek where the true villain of the piece is so unremittingly evil that one is unafraid to hate his guts for the film's duration. It makes the payoff at the end of the film that much more satisfying. The torments and injuries the Captain endures through the course of the film are gruesome enough, but we are allowed the luxury of believing he deserves every bit of it. As a nemesis for his stepdaughter, the Captain is one of the best-drawn middlemen of evil since Darth Vader. Yet, in spite of how he can gouge a man's eyes out without pausing for breath, he is by no means the most frightening thing in the film.El Laberinto Del Fauno, as you would expect with a film bearing such a title, is entirely in Spanish. This obviously necessitated the use of subtitles to translate the dialogue in countries where Spanish is not the primary language, but the nuances of the language would also make dubbing a crime. Even if you do not understand the phrases being spoken, their enunciations make the intent in every sentence plainly obvious. El Laberinto Del Fauno moves and plays like a silent film, where the combinations of body language and music allow the viewer to draw their own conclusion regarding the scene. One could even treat scenes like the Captain conducting his torture sessions as being a comedy if that is their inclination. Quite frankly, I feel it is a sick one, but that is the viewer's prerogative. To be quite frank, scenes in which participants torture one another have a much better aural quality to them when the dialogue is in Spanish. As a result, El Laberinto Del Fauno is the only film I have seen to date, other than Paul Verhoeven's Dutch-language efforts, that I feel uncomfortable watching at times.Special mention must go to the special effects team who, for one reason or another, chose to make the film using practical effects for what amounts to a majority of the screen time. CGI seems to have been limited to such tasks as painting out an actor's real legs or other such fine details that could not otherwise have been accomplished. The faun is such a marvel of practical costume design, puppetry, and digital erasure that one wonders if the whole team did not suddenly become possessed by the ghost of Jim Henson. However, unlike Ludo, Kermit, or Animal, the production team in this case has mastered the one emotion that Henson was never able to invoke in an adult audience: fear. Yes, even this grown man who continues to stand in horror as the realisation dawns that we have not learned a thing from the time this film is set in feels a shudder of genuine fear when the faun appears to lose his patience with Ofelia. Perhaps it has something to do with the complexity of the character.If you have not already seen the film, I advise skipping this paragraph, but it is necessary to discuss the final moments in order to illustrate a point. I must also praise the writers for the maturity and power of their story. The ambiguous nature of how the ending is phrased can lead the viewer to entirely different conclusions. If they choose, they can believe the princess was rewarded for her willingness to shed her own blood in place of her half-brother's. Conversely, they may also choose to believe the reward was little more than a dying hope on the behalf of yet another victim of a senseless war. Either way, praise is due to writer/director Guillermo del Toro for refusing to take the easy way out and simply throw a clearly happy ending into the audience's lap in order to appease them. This is a bold move that Peter Jackson especially fumbled by failing to execute in a satisfactory fashion. And that is partly the point. In spite of not being based on one of the most celebrated novels in the English language, El Laberinto Del Fauno will be remembered long after The Lord Of The Rings In Name Only is forgotten.El Laberinto Del Fauno is a ten out of ten film that everyone, but especially those with an interest in storytelling, should see at least twice.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
"Beautiful production, underwhelming story...","In 1944 Spain, as the Spanish Resistance is losing to the Fascist army, a pre-teen bookworm named Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her pregnant mother come to stay with the girl's new stepfather, an icy army captain. While stopping for a break on their initial journey, the youngster fits the missing piece of a statue into its proper place; this unleashes a magical winged creature who leads the girl to the pale faun, a gargoyle-like guru who helps Ofelia understand she possesses the spirit of the Princess Moanna and will live eternal...that is, until she completes three heady tasks before the next full moon! Spanish-language fantasy from writer-director Guillermo del Toro begins well, combining elements of Grimm and 'Alice in Wonderland' with the modern, grotesque look of a Björk music video; however, the elements of the story are hazy rather than coherent (if Ofelia hadn't put back the missing piece, would she still have Moanna's spirit?). Baquero is sublime as the child, but every segue from her to the evil captain halts the movie's momentum, and the incidentals (the captain's party, Ofelia ruining her new dress, the assistant sneaking medicine) aren't compelling. A film which bides its time between an incredible fantasy world and the harsh realities of the day is ultimately going to come up short (we can't wait for the preliminaries to be over with so that the real story can progress); despite a smoothly efficient direction and an able cast, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" simply feels too slight, too undemanding to garner status as a fantasy classic. ** from ****",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Absolutely breathtaking,"I didn't quite know what to expect with Pan's Labrynth. (Didn't even realize I was part of a test screening for it...) With that sad, this was one of the most amazing films I've ever seen. The imagery and cgi are top-notch, and (dare I say) believable! Elements of fantasy blend well with the setting of the war-torn Spanish countryside, without pretentiousness and overbearing presentation.The violence was intense at moments, but it wasn't violence for the sake of violence. You won't see men falling to pieces on screen as with other war movies, but you will see commentary on human nature expressed through particularly intense moments.What perfected this movie for me was the character of Captain Vidal, and his contrast with the Faun and Mercedes. My hatred for this character kept me on the edge of my seat through most of the film.Do yourself a favor. Skip Stomp the Yard and The Hitcher.

The God Pan is Alive!!,"Excellent, successfully combining at least four different genres: coming of age, horror, fantasy, horrors of war docudrama, along with probably a few others.The fantasy images are spectacular and the human drama is intense. Unlike many movies that attempt to combine scattered fantasy elements into otherwise naturalistic environments, it never felt like I was being ripped away from the fantasy every time they focused on reality. What was going on in both worlds was compelling.Pan is portrayed very faithfully as a god of the earth and somewhat of a trickster. When I first saw the trailer and saw how demon-like they made Pan's appearance, I was concerned that the creators had Christianized the story and turned Pan into Satan. I was relieved to discover they stayed faithful to the Pan of Pagan mythology, so no Pagans watching it should fear defamation and no mythologists or historians should fear being totally annoyed.The horrors of war are brutally honest and graphic, which is exactly how war should be betrayed. So many movies romanticize it or make patriotic statements, when really war is an unspeakably terrible thing, especially when people have to live under a fascist regime, like the characters in this movie.Loved it, absolutely loved it.

Emperor's new clothes,"Obviously, all opinions on film are purely subjective, but I fail to see how this film lives up to its awesome reputation.Yes, it's nicely made, and Sergi Lopez is a fantastic super-villain, but there's little to amaze here.It's a film of two halves, fantasy and reality, and although there are some obvious parallels they fail to converge with any purpose.The fantasy sequences are Harry Potter meets Hellraiser. They look good but are not as visually stunning nor as strangely disturbing as you may have been led to believe. They owe more to standard fairy tales written by adults than they do the wild imaginings of children.Interestingly, the reality sections are the more like a child's view of the civil war in Spain, where the communists are lovable heroes and the fascists impossibly evil. Perhaps this is deliberate, but if so, I can't see the point.Del Toro's The Devil's Backbone is better in every respect, so I recommend you adjust your expectations to less than masterpiece before viewing.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Only Half-Fantasy,"I was excited to see this movie. I was expecting a high octane fantasy film with a lot of fairy-tale-ish stories, but it was a bit more focused on reality than the labyrinth. It was more centered on the war and it distracted from the Labyrinth's story. However I still loved it. The acting was amazing by the whole cast, and the make-up and effects were amazing. I loved the Pale Man the most. He was so freaky, That is the only horror character that I believe would scare me. However he could not best me in battle.The characters were great, but the story seemed bland. They jumped around too much for my taste.

Pan's Labyrinth - A Magical Masterpiece.,"Set in the 1944 fascist era of Spain, Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth is a wonderful but chaotic fairytale that teeters between nightmare, enchantment, and reality. While the story holds a some-what simple, straight forward plot, it is entwined with spectacular imagery, intelligent writing, and some of the most captivating moments that have ever hit the big screen. While this film by definition is considered a fantasy piece, it has a bit of something for everyone; making it an enjoyable film for all walks of life. Through-out this movie, Del Toro manages to weave a bit of history, politics, and fantasy, all together creating an original, unique, and compelling film.This film quickly begins as a unique story of a young girl named Ofelia unfolds. Ofelia, (played by Ivana Baquero), appears to be an average kid who loves to read and tell fairy tales. Her life drastically changes as she is sent along with her pregnant mother (played by Ariadna Gil) to live with her new stepfather, Capitán Vidal. Capitán Vidal (played by Sergi López), is a ruthless and unforgiving captain of the Spanish army who wants his soon-to-be-born son to grow up with him; hoping that he can help carry out his name. Although Ofelia's ""real life"" situation turns sour as she must deal with her sick mother, as well as the violence that plagues the outdoors between the rebels and fascist troops -- all of these things quickly become less significant as she gets sucked into her own creative world; a world of mystery, enchanting fairies, faun's and giant frogs.Overall, I felt that this movie was extremely well done. From the amazing cast to the superb imagery, everything in this film was spot-on and created with a great deal of care. Although some of the previews may have been deceiving -- I will say that this movie is not a child's film. While there are some truly beautiful scenes that everyone could appreciate and love, there is also a great deal of realistic violence, death, corruption, and torture. In fact, over ¾'s of the movie is spent focusing on the ""real"" world within this base, which definitely isn't a pretty sight. I can however, say with certainty that Pan's Labyrinth is a brilliantly directed masterpiece, with some of the most visually jaw dropping scene's I've ever seen. This is easily the best fantasy film of 2006. If you like fantasy, I suggest you check this out; however, do be aware that there is quite a bit of violence in this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

The mixture of real life horror with the fantastical world was truly inspired. The effects were incredibly realistic and had me squirm as much as look on in awe. The acting and casting was perfect in every instance. Ivana Baquero was fantastic as the young girl who is caught so easily into a potentially dangerous and magical world, as the real world she is forced to be in is such a horrific war torn environment. Overall I recommend this to anyone who claims to love movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Visually stunning but lacks coherence,"I wish I could say I liked this film more than I did, since it certainly has some impressive aspects to it. Undeniably it is visually stunning, particularly the fantasy sequences, which feature some marvellously weird and imaginative fairy tale beasts. The acting is also excellent.Yet I just didn't feel the two story strands - the real world civil war drama and the fairy tale fantasy - gelled together in a meaningful way. I'm not sure if the fantasy aspect was supposed to be some kind of allegorical comment on fascism, but if it was it was too obscure for me to appreciate. Instead it just seemed to sit uneasily alongside the often brutal events unfolding in the real world sequences.Altogether it had the feeling of a film that thought itself more profound than it actually was. Although it carried me along well enough while I was watching it, after it finished the impression I was left with was of a mildly diverting, but ultimately inconsequential piece of film-making.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Harmful at best,"As I see movies made within the past 20 years climb the ranks of the IMDb top 250 with alarming speed, I wonder what on earth is happening. I see that this movie is at #41, higher than Chinatown, The Third Man, To Kill a Mockingbird, Alien, The Bridge on the River Kwai, Metropolis, and even The Wizard of Oz. Does Pan's Labyrinth deserve such high praise? Yes, it is steeped in intellectual metaphor and is crafted in such a Philip K. Dickian manner that the audience is left wondering what was real in the film. I applaud the filmmakers abilities in this manner, but regarding what they are willing to portray, they have the restraint of sociopaths. This movie contains some of the most wretched, horrific violence and psychologically uncomfortable character interactions I have ever seen in a film. Early in the movie, we watch as the cruel Captain Vidal crushes the face of an innocent young man while his helpless father watches. Vidal shoots the father moments later, after the man had to watch his son die in front of him.Art is no longer on the minds of movie makers, instead they revel in their abilities to accurately replicate grisly murders and terrible nightmares. Suggesting violence gives way to indulging in the talents of the make up artists and the FX men. Subtlety and metaphor are discarded so the audience is not simply a witness to gruesome murders, but is forced to be a part of them. The story, fascinating as its concept may be, is buried under layers of constant uncomfortableness. There is no relief for the audience. Thanks to the movie establishing the evil of Vidal early on, the audience squirms in dreaded anticipation for what his next cruel act will be, and who he will direct his wrath towards. The movie ultimately delivers, committing the cardinal sin that a movie can make: showing the graphic death of a child. Pay It Forward tried this bit of emotional manipulation, and lost any credibility it had as a story. The narrative was lost, the escapism destroyed. Once the innocent little girl died in Pan's Labyrinth, the audience remembers that they're watching a story and their emotions are being toyed with.I despise seeing such films because I ultimately feel anger not towards the characters in the films, but at the filmmakers themselves for presenting me with such atrocities. I know Pan's Labyrinth is based in folklore, but I don't believe for a second that this is any kind of fairy tale. When a parent reads a child Hansel and Gretel, the visuals are very cartoony and are relayed through the buffer of said parent. With this ""film,"" there is nothing but blood seeping from the mouth of an innocent little girl to tell the audience that the fairy tale is over. A fairy tale for adults? That's false advertising and I hope that all with weak stomachs are fairly warned.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

A masterpiece..,"This film will go down as being one of my all time favourites. Guillermo del Toro has done a fantastic job of bringing together war and the innocence of a young girls mind.There are very few movies where I can say that I think every actor (including the extras!) were brilliant but this is it. A shining star amongst them all must be Ivana Baquero. She takes on the hardest role of them all as she has to portray a young girl trying to cope with her own demons alongside trying to cope with living with a step father and in the middle of a battle field. Sergi López as the captain is another classic character, a lovable rogue you can respect as well as loathe.All in all this film has something for everybody.

"Upon seeing a motion-picture such as this, viewers can hardly help but to surrender under the overwhelming weight of elation that results from its liberating creativity.","Bravo Guillermo! From the brilliantly perturbed visionary who shared his eerily morose tale of abhorrent warfare and infringed adolescent innocence in 'The Devil's Backbone,' comes the gorgeously sadistic fantasy, 'Pan's Labyrinth.' As quality fantasies seem to do, Del Toro's elegantly haunting 'Labyrinth' infiltrates the mind by way of its intrigue's fantastic visions; in this case, he does so with an alarming tale of Spanish tyranny, disquieting violence and superfluous gore. Not since the likes of Argento's 'Deep Red' and 'Suspiria' has carnage been so immeasurably beautiful. This poignant saga shadows the dreamy adventures of Ofelia, an imaginative young girl who creates the fanciful world of 'Pan's Labyrinth,' in which remarkable creatures of various sorts dwell. As the repressed nation of Spain witnesses its peak in post-war violence, Ofelia's adoptive father is given the responsibility of eradicating any rebellious alliances from the vicinity. While he and his wife struggle with the troublesome happenings outside their home, Ofelia escapes to her favorite place; one rich with wondrous landscapes and unknown fortune. 'Pan's Labyrinth' is a film of exceptionally rare caliber. Upon seeing a motion-picture such as this, viewers can hardly help but to surrender under the overwhelming weight of elation that results from its liberating creativity. Del Toro's 'Pan's' could very well be this year's 'Fellowship of the Ring,' snagging Oscar nods in the departments of makeup, costume design, set decoration, sound, editing, and art direction; heck, maybe it'll even win a few.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

Didn't love it as much as most,"Because everyone else had waxed so euphoric over this film, I went with high expectations. However, though I enjoyed it, I did not find it to be as extraordinary as I was led to expect. For one thing, the Faun is an awkward and crude creation, with a mad hint of Muppet about him; perhaps my vision has been spoiled by the proliferation of special effects in recent decades. For another, the movie was so dark and claustrophobic (both in the fantasy scenes and in the ""real-life"" scenes) that it was almost a caricature. The young lead actress was excellent, as were all the actors. However, the story line with its noble Nationalists, sadistic captain, innocent child, and bed-ridden mother-to-be struck me as hackneyed.

"Powerful, emotional, terrifying. Brilliant.","To start with, can I just say quite simply: this is the best film I have ever seen. Ever.

Pan's Labirynth is so extraordinary, I can barley begin to describe it in any way that would do it justice.Set in civil war Spain, Ofelia (brilliantly played by Ivana Baquero) meets a Faun who promises to take her to a mystical land, where she can live immortally, if she can complete three tasks. The fantastical aspects of the film are interwoven with the real world, where the brutal captain Vidal, recently married to Ofelia's mother, takes the fight to left-wing rebels.Pan's Labirynth is brutal and realistic and certainly one of the most violent films I've seen in a while, and I found my self looking away numerous times despite the many horror movies I've seen in the before. The violence is all in context and never feels exploitative or out of place. The film has an emotional power which I have never seen so well achieved in any film before, to such an extent I found myself in tears, several times. There are scarier elements to, such as 'the Pale Man' which is uncannily terrifying. Equally in the real word Sergi Lopez is a terrifying presence, particularly in the scenes of torture which he executes.I never thought a film would displace Apocalypse Now as my number one, but this has spectacularly.

Ofelia Dreams,"Don't get muddled up. This is not a movie in which a cute American girl dances with she-man David Bowie and makes pals with huge cuddly toys. No, this is one of those eviler fairy tales with baby-eating monsters and bloody carnage. The kind of stuff that Hellboy director Guillermo Del Toro is best at.Ofelia and her mother move from the city to a large mansion in a rural area of 1944 Spain. Mother has remarried, since the death of her dad, to the cruel and wicked Captain Vidal. A man who only wants her for her womb and unborn child, with no interest in Ofelia at all. Vidal and his men use the mansion as a base to fight against the Republican rebels.Not the best of environments for an 11-year-old to be in, Ofelia stumbles upon the Labyrinth of Fauno (Pan, the Goat God, has nothing to do with this film, so I don't understand the English title) in the expansive mansion garden. Deep inside she finds Fauno, a sort of...well he's a mix of a lot of things. Imagine Darkness from Legend crossed with Mr. Tumnus, The Predator and Davy Jones. Fauno tells her that she is really the Princess of some Magical Kingdom. Her father, the King has been searching for her and has opened many portals to Earth. Fauno believes she is the one and tests her by ordering the completion of 3 bizarre tasks.The real world around Ofelia crumbles as Captain Vidal goes psycho, brutally murdering and torturing almost anyone he can. The rebels close in and her mother becomes very sick. Preferring Fauno's ghoulish tasks to witness murder on a daily basis, Ofelia becomes increasingly involved in her enigmatic Labyrinth world.In this respect it is very much like Catherine Storr's novel Marianne Dreams (and then the movie Paperhouse by Bernard Rose). Even Javier Navarrete's wonderful score sometimes reminded me of Hans Zimmer's score for Paperhouse. Definitely a CD I will have to get when it comes out! Despite the adult rating I would still take kids to see this. And by that I mean intelligent kids who are not addicted to Playstation and who don't mind subtitles.

a Spanish-speaking fantasy movie that will thrill the World,"I was eagerly awaiting the release of the movie since I first heard of the project, and even more after seeing the trailers. I was not disappointed.Arriving at the cinema, the cashier told me this movie is subtitled because in Spanish, and asked me if I was put off. I answered that I was expecting it, and this was very important to my eyes. Indeed, Guillermo del Toro did amazingly well to resist any pressure or any temptation to shoot the movie in English, but I really think there was not even a doubt as to what language to use. This adds to the magic and the beauty of the movie.I am running out of superlatives to describe the movie, and my advice would be to go and see it for yourselves. It's a compelling tale of sadness, hope, innocence, passion, love, hate, power and drama. We are torn between two worlds: on one side the magical world of Ofelia, with its fairies, and on the other the cruel reality that is war. Both are extremely well mixed together and we are continuously drawn from one to the other with virtuoso handling from del Toro.The actors were all superb. Having seen Sergi Lopez from its french movies I was really blown away by the performance he gives as the Captain. Ivana Baquero is just perfect as Ofelia, and Maribel Verdu gives also a great performance. The supporting roles (particularly the doctor) are also very strong.I really hope Guillermo del Toro gets the recognition he greatly deserves, and wish this movie to stay on as one of the best of its kind for many decades to come. I can only conclude by advising you to see it and to be prepared for a lifetime experience",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
"A Fine Film With Gorgeous Costume Design And Terrific Performances, But Let Down By Overbeaing Cartoonish Messaging, And With Too Much Focus On The Spanish Civil War Storyline","Pros:
1. The blood and gore looks epic and provides for some gnarly kills.
2. The set and costume design are awe-inspiring, particularly Fauno and the Pale Man (Doug Jones).
3. The CGI is really impressive and it more than holds 14 years later.
4. Doug Jones, Sergi López (Vidal), and Maribel Verdú (Mercedes) all deliver brilliant performances.
5. The score, despite being a little overplayed, lathers the movie in an ethereal atmosphere.Cons:
1. The lighting at night is blatantly artificial, and it looks ugly and distracting.
2. The score is needlessly overplayed at times.
3. The cartoonist presentation of Fascists as the bad guys, and the Communists as the good guys, is obnoxious and frustrating.
4. There are a few cheesy lines of dialogue that make the film feel like a soap opera.
5. There is too much focus on the Fascist/ Communist conflict, and not enough screen-time dedicated to the fantasy storyline.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
"After watching this, if I don't believe in fairies, then I am the cruel Captain","Wow, wow, wow... While watching the end credits, I was thinking about all the great Spanish pieces of art I have ever seen ... The fantastic combination of all the colours and surrealistic paintings have mixed up at once in my mind. It is not a surprise that this amazing work won an Oscar for Cinematography. Guillermo Navarro and Del Torro had a beautiful dream coming true. The story is transferred on the screen incredibly, the creatures appearing in the vault are just like real(the faun, fairies, the terrifying eye-in-palm creature). I am not up to fantasy pictures, but this one moved my mind right from the start.The main idea for me is:What YOU believe, no one else does, because the OTHERS do not believe in a thing. Not to believe in anything is the cause of all the chaos and unrest in the world. Believing is something that makes our life a whole, whether it is true or not, whether we believe in something usual or even in a better world. Everything in the world is magic as long as we DO BELIEVE it is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
A visually stunning dark fairytale with a few flaws,"""Pan'a Labyrinth"" is an undeniably beautiful and haunting film that masterfully blends fantasy and reality. Guillermo del Toro's vision is bold and imaginative, bringing to life a dark fairytale that feels both timeless and grounded in history. The story of Ofelia, a young girl navigating the horrors of Francoist Spain while escaping into a magical world, is compelling and layered, filled with symbolism and emotional depth.The film excels in its visuals. The cinematography is breathtaking, with rich, earthy tones and striking contrasts between the grim, oppressive real world and the eerie yet enchanting fantasy realm. The creature designs, particularly the Faun and the Pale Man, are both mesmerizing and unsettling, showcasing del Toro's talent for creating memorable and otherworldly characters.The performances are strong, with Ivana Baquero delivering a heartfelt portrayal of Ofelia. Sergi López is chilling as the cruel and calculating Capitan Vidal, embodying the brutality of the regime he represents. The supporting cast adds weight to the story, especially Maribel Verdú as the brave and compassionate Mercedes.However, the film is not without its flaws. The pacing can feel uneven at times, with some scenes dragging while others rush through crucial moments. While the fantasy elements are mesmerizing, they sometimes feel disconnected from the grim political backdrop, making the balance between the two worlds slightly jarring. Additionally, certain plot points feel predictable, which detracts from the overall sense of poetry and wonder.""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a film that lingers in your mind long after it ends, thanks to its striking visuals and emotional core. While it doesn't fully reach its potential as a perfect blend of fantasy and historical drama, it is still a remarkable and ambitious piece of storytelling. It's a dark, poetic journey that's well worth experiencing, even if it falls short of being a masterpiece.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Alice in Labyrinth,"This fairy tale with parallels to ""Alice in Wonderland"" has a little girl encountering bizarre characters in an alternate universe. The cinematography is quite impressive and del Toro displays a fine visual flair. However, the script is too random and contrived to be interesting and the characters are one-dimensional. The captain, for example, is pure evil, lacking a single redeeming character; his wife is a whiny weakling. The film intersperses the fairy tale with the account of the fascist army fighting insurgents, but the two threads don't complement each other. It's like watching two movies. del Toro's obsession with stomach-churning violence doesn't help matters.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
A Must See Film,"This film deserves the Oscar for best film never mind best foreign film. The acting by all participants is an example to all aspiring actors. I went in to see this film with some trepidation but was amazed by the sheer simplicity of the story and the characterisations that carried the story throughout the film. The director has managed to incorporate both fantasy and reality in such away as to entice the audience to believe in his story. One word of question is that I think Spanish film makers are now attempting to rewrite Spanish history via films portraying the civil war, in such a way that the Republican army should have won this war and the Facists should never have come to power in the first place.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Reality vs. Illusion,"Now listen, I don't usually shower films with perfect tens, let alone those that are yet to stand the test of time, but I have to be honest here: I can't find anything tangibly wrong with Guillermo del Toro's ""Pan's Labyrinth"". Set against the backdrop of Franco's fascist repression in 1944, a young girl descends into fabled fantasy to escape the harsh reality of her step-father reign. This beautiful set-up is sheer darkly goosebumps-inducing magic, and the bitter everyday drama is almost as bitingly compelling.""Pan's Labyrinth"" is in this way neatly-composed of two parallel stories operating seamlessly in the same film, interweaving bucketloads of suspense in every single shot. On the realistic, reality-based end of the spectrum, we have Sergi López as the repressive big-shot Capitán Vidal, Ofelia's step-father. Although the latter brings wonderful wide-eyed intensity to her leading role, it is truly López who projects the most charisma in his performance, creating not a caricature of a villain, but a fully-fledged powerhouse of a tyrant.Ofelia is not as well-acted as she is well-written, it needs to be said. Yet this is understandable, for Del Toro gives us a no-holds-barred likable heroine who displays some of the most fearless antics you will see in films this year. She crawls through muddy hellholes with bugs on her legs. She visits demons. When she sees the iconic fearsome faun again, she runs up and hugs him. When her mother asks her to tell her unborn child a soothing bed-time story, Ofelia tells him dark nightmares, because they're stories to her.As for cinematography and the likes, the more CGI there is in a film, the more heart it needs to project. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" passes this criteria with flying colours because although the heaviest weapon in Guillermo Del Toro's directorial arsenal is undeniably his dark visuals, the wrapping story is so tear-jerkingly compelling that CGI typically takes a backseat to the drama in the film. The score, lullabies and all, is unspeakably disturbing  which tells me it is scored perfectly to a fantasy epic like this.Yes, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a foreign film, foreign not only in its speaking language, but in its visual linguistics and imagination. The whole world created on the colour-awash screen is alien to most people, and atmospheric originality goes a long way. In the end, the film is a self-spun cocoon of childhood magic laced with dark notions, something like a NC-17 version of Alice in Wonderland  something absolutely extraordinary.10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

This movie renewed my interest in movies, and I look forward to going back and watch del Toro's other films. I would recommend it to anyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
"In fantasy, you have to believe reality","Pan's Labyrinth tempts you in from the first beautiful second. Rather like entering a labyrinth you quickly leave the light and enter dark, mysterious tunnels which promise a new shock around each corner, both fantastical and brutally human. This is not a labyrinth you would take a child.Sergi Lopez broods a performance so devilishly vile the audience literally recoiled when he was on screen. His blood chilling psycopath in fascist breeches should walk him into the Oscar running, if not he should consider taking his toolbox around to the Academy members and asking them why not.The rest of the cast perform with subtle class, especially the young girl who proves that young actors do not need to be force fed sugar cubes for 6 months before shooting. Credit for this must go to the Director who is, for me anyway, deserving of all the acclaim he is receiving.The film is unrelenting in its turns into fantasy and back again, flashing us back into into cruelty of real life.My only fear is that its stark violence and Spanish language might restrict the size of its audience. This is, of course, what makes the film all the more special. It is wonderfully believable and in fantasy, that is truly everything.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
A Spanish fantasy for all,"I've not seen any of Guillermo del Toro's earlier films, but this one places him, along with Alejandro González Iñárritu and Alfonso Cuaron, as a Spanish-American film-maker with broad appeal. This film (unlike ""Babel"") sticks within one very specific cultural milieu, Franco's Spain in 1944 seen through the eyes of Ofelia, an 11 year old girl whose widowed mother has been desperate enough to marry a particularly zealous and nasty fascist army officer. Not surprisingly she escapes into her own world of fantasy, in which she is a princess of the underworld trying to find her way home.The film is stacked full of good performances. Ivana Banquero, is stunning as Ofelia, and Sergi Lopez is completely convincing as her ruthless and single-minded stepfather, Captain Vidal. Maribel Verdu as Mercedes the housekeeper also puts in a strong performance, as does Alex Angulo as the doctor and Doug Jones as Pan and the Pale Man (aided by some terrific costume design).It is interesting that while the fascists are portrayed as the bad guys del Toro makes an attempt to explain what drives them. In one dinner scene the local notables are entertained by Vidal to a sumptuous feast (while everyone around is on strict rations). After the third or so round of drinks he announces that all men are not equal, ""we won the war and therefore deserve the best."" His listeners (except for the doctor) enthusiastically agree. Vidal, desperate for a son, is also motivated by tradition; his father was an army general who died in battle, for Vidal ""the only way to die"". But he is also a sadist  his interrogations go long past mere military brutality. Perhaps the message is you don't have to be a sadist to be a good fascist, but it helps.The resistance are of course portrayed as the good guys, but their tactics are as brutal as those of the military, shooting the wounded where they fall, for example. They also find it hard to accept that the war is over, and they are merely the subject of a mopping-up operation headed up by a real bastard very happy in his work.Most of the action takes place in a gloomy and surprisingly wet forest so well evoked we can almost smell the mud. The fantasy sequences owe something to Lewis Carroll as well as Mervyn Peake - ""Alice in Wonderland"" meets ""Gormenghast"" (Pan has a little in common with the White Rabbit). Visually, this is a terrific film.The good guys did win out in the end, but it took another 30 years, and happened peacefully. The speed at which Spain has left its fascist past behind tells us something, I think.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
"Of course it's violent, but not for violence's sake.","I have seen a lot of comments about the violence in this film, and frankly I'm disappointed in the people who are posting them. This is not a children's movie. This is not a fairy tale. If you were looking for that, perhaps Narnia would be more to your liking.The fairy tale world that this girl inhabits is a form of escape from the realities of her life. Those realities include neglect, they include injustice, and of course, they include violence. The viewer has to see that, and they must feel it too. To not show the violence and not elicit that visceral reaction in the viewer defeats the purpose of the whole movie.Stop being such prudes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
One of the best fantasy films that i have seen.,"I am a huge fantasy aficionado. Films like Blancanieves, LOTR series and Miyazaki's works are my personal favorites. I knew that Del Toro was a fine film-maker when it came to telling a dark fantasy story. So, when the credits started rolling, i knew that i had seen one of the best films of all time. The real beauty lies in the fact that Del Toro manages to blend Spanish civil war and a beautifully lavish fantasy world together. The film is brutal yet magical. This is a fairy-tale for grown ups where Ofelia's child-like imagination runs free yet the world created by her is full of horror. As far as acting goes it is Sergi López's fantastic portrayal of Vidal that caught my eye. His performance is chilling enough to make you hate the captain. Ivana Baquero portrays Ofelia with a nuance which is beyond her years. And lastly it is Guillermo Navarro's masterful cinematography that breathes life in every scene. A true masterpiece which is sure to remain a high benchmark for fantasy films in years to come.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
I didn't know I would love this,"I just this movie a couple days ago. My bf insisted me to watched saying how he liked Pan's Labyrinth a lot. At first, I was skeptic toward to watch it because I thought it would be some kind of cliche fantasy movie. But I was totally wrong. Guillermo de Toro delivered a very beautiful yet tragic story. I said it is not cliche because first it is a dark fantasy with bloody scenes (I thought the movie was a happy-journey thing). And I love when the character is faced with danger there is not a suddenly-hero-come from nowhere to help him/ her. Mercedes is the character I favorite most. She is strong, brave and smart. I felt like clapping when she brutally attack the captain. Besides, I hate the main character most, Ofelia.

A child's troubled fantasy in a harsh world.,"Pan's Labyrinth is a masterpiece. It paints a dark and disturbing picture about the horrors of war and how an innocent, imaginative child copes with her gruesome reality.CAVEAT: THIS ""FANTASY"" MAY NOT BE WHAT YOU EXPECT!Note to those who are expecting a romantic escapist fantasy flick - this is a VERY DARK and disturbing movie, not for the light hearted and impressionable. Definitely NOT for children. Definitely NOT a ""date"" movie, unless afterwords you plan to spend a detox session at home sipping warm milk, watching Teletubbies. And I thought that ""Se7en"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" were romantic comedies. Some scenes will make even the most hardened of the audience members cringe. Be warned.Is it a Fantasy, as advertised?

One of the best fairy tales for adults I've ever seen,"Guillermo Del-Toro goes into full bloom with a real feat of cinematic strength with Pan's Labyrinth, the kind of film that builds more and more with momentum until one's left in a total engrossment in the storytelling and the fates of the characters (mainly the little girl of the story, Ivana Baquero's Ofelia). Del-Toro knows that since his movie is mainly more for adults than the kids (I wouldn't not recommend it to kids, but the younger ones would definitely get freaked out by the more gruesomely violent moments), it should really be provocative by way of showing how a child has no other choice but to go into the realm of one's fantasies. But on further introspection about the movie, what makes it even more fascinating is how, in a strange way, it's not escapism in the sense that the girl retreats to the dreamworld. If anything the dreamworld retreats to her, or rather each side of fantasy and reality have an equal pertinence here, unlike another film from this past year, the (underlooked) Terry Gilliam film Tideland, where a little girl also had to escape under no other recourse to which it transformed her own world-view to a great degree. Pan's Labyrinth blends together a unique form of magical realism that grows more potent and aborbing on a repeat viewing, and it's actually stronger by showing how the fantastical can be contrasted with what's really terrifying and cruel in the world.In this case it comes in the form of fascism and a kind of rule-by-law/fear, and in the form of the little girl's step-father, Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez, formerly of With a Friend Like Harry). His is one of the great antagonist performances I've seen in recent memory, though mostly because of Del-Toro making him such a force of domination and cruelty on anyone who doesn't fit into his obedience and world-view. He and his troops are facing off against the rebels in the area circa 1940s Franco-run Spain, and has no tolerance for anyone in his midst who won't go under his form of justice (there's an immediate form of repulsion by what he does, graphically, to father and son peasants who only were in the woods after rabbits). The stakes become raised, however, when his troops capture one of the rebels alive, and after torture, there's recognition among some of the caretakers in his home, like the good doctor- who is there really to take care of the Captain's very pregnant wife and mother of Ofelia- and the head maid of the household (the great Maribel Verdu as Mercedes), and suddenly Ofelia finds herself pit against this man that she could never stand to begin with, but now sees as a true threat to what she has to accomplish.And what she has to accomplish is the more fantastical portion of the picture, a very strange but completely illuminating set of scenes where we find that Ofelia really has the spirit of an underworld princess in her, and a faun (er, 'Pan'), gets her to complete tasks in order to set the spirit free. But in the face of the Captain, and her own mother's weakened spirit (which leads to a very sad state of affairs), it becomes the greatest struggle of Ofelia's life, and all in the midst of a political conflict settled in this environment with guns and overwrought bloodshed that she couldn't even begin to understand. Hence, the escapism. But part of the greatness in Pan's Labyrinth- aside from the tremendous technical accomplishments on all fronts (cinematography, production and creature design, special/visual effects, the attention to detail with both the historical and more fairy-tale aspects)- is that we really care about Ofelia's struggle, as she's really in a dire situation when she has to snap back from her time with the insects/fairies and meetings with the faun. Through the bleakness that surrounds her, one can see how the fantasy is not just a sweet desire, but a necessity in youth- however one might want it as an adult as well.Filled with heart and ideas, a climax that really becomes moving and captivating without becoming too sentimental, and with some individual scenes that rank with the best in the decade (Lopez's scene where he stitches back his own face- and then takes a drink of alcohol- is priceless, ditto for when Ofelia has to get the dagger from the banquet hall), this is a real marvel of ""magical realism"", as it's been dubbed, and is surely Del-Toro's triumph so far as a filmmaker (and, like Gilliam, visionary to boot).",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

"beautiful and twisted, but mainly beautiful","The way Del Toro balances this story between the cruel reality of the Spanish civil war and the wonder of this realm he's created is perfect. This is one of the purest fantasy movies I've seen, and it's beautiful throughout, even in scenes without Ofelia and her imagination present. Behind the gloom is a strong family tale; Ofelia's love for her mother, the struggles Mercedes goes through with her brother, and Captain Vidal's strained history with his father. This instills heart to what could easily be nothing more than a florid piece, regarded purely for it's dress-up (which is incredible).The performances were also great. Ivana Bacquero and Maribel Verdu were standouts, but it's Sergi Lopez's embodiment of evil as Captain Vidal that leaves the biggest impression. As far as movie villains go, he'd have to be up there with the best. Credit is due also to Doug Jones, the man who is usually behind the amazing costumes in GDT films. His movements as The Faun and The Pale Man ranged from powerful and intimidating to absolutely terrifying. Extra credit too for learning Spanish.This film is a remarkable achievement, not just for Spanish cinema but cinema as a whole. It should be remembered as one of the most riveting pieces of dark fantasy. Guillermo Del Toro is a genius and master of this genre, and the people behind the scenes who work with costumes, set designs, FX etc. are incredible.A movie I would recommend that's similar in terms of dream-like fantasy and a completely visceral feel is a 2006 film called The Fall.

Heart and craft,"Pan's Labyrinth is a beautiful union of heart and craft. The writing stands out because it has several strong layers. The story is emotionally impactful, open to interpretation, original, thematic, and grounded yet fantastical.

The cinematography subtly propels the film's themes through color schemes, composition, and framing. Scenes fluidly transition on matching camera movements, suggesting the relationship between imagination and reality. The sound design is surreal in supernatural scenes (heightening their magic) and stark in dramatic scenes (heightening their harshness). The music is mystical yet melancholy, flawlessly expressing the film's tone. Finally, the effects and production designs are visionary and make Pan's Labyrinth iconic.

Weaving War and Fantasy: A Magical and Very Graphic experience,"Pre-Watch Thoughts:
The title, *Pan's Labyrinth*, hints at a story rooted in mythology. With ""Pan"" representing the Greek god of nature and the labyrinth often symbolizing a complex journey or challenge, I expected the film to explore mystical themes, nature, and perhaps a journey filled with trials and symbolic meaning.Cinematography:
The cinematography, while effective, is not particularly experimental. The use of color, especially the cooler blue lighting at night, sets the mood well, but it doesn't push boundaries. The transitions between scenes are smooth and well-executed, yet visually, the film sticks to traditional techniques without venturing into more innovative territory.Rating: (3/5)Mise-en-scène:
The film excels in its detailed production design, blending practical effects and CGI to create an immersive experience. However, the reliance on CGI in certain moments might feel a bit overdone for those who prefer more practical effects. The richly detailed setting feels grim and lacks the vibrancy that could balance the darker elements.Rating: (4/5)Sound Design:
The sound design is well-crafted and helps build the atmosphere, but the film's score may feel repetitive at times. While it successfully underscores the emotional beats, the soundtrack doesn't quite stand out in a memorable way beyond the viewing experience.Rating: (3/5)Storytelling and Narrative:
The film tells two intertwined stories, seamlessly blending the real and the fantastical. However, the pacing can feel slow in parts, especially when the film lingers too long on either storyline. The narrative's ambiguity may leave some viewers wanting more clarity, while others might appreciate its open-ended nature.Rating: (4/5)Final Thoughts:
""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a visually captivating and emotionally resonant film that mixes fantasy with historical drama. While it may not break new ground in its cinematography or sound design, it offers a well-crafted and immersive experience. Overall, it effectively explores deep themes and delivers a powerful message.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

They give her a chance to meet her father and save her family from the Captain but she'll need to follow the faun's instructions to perfection or risk losing her opportunity.This movie is directed by Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy I & II) and stars Ivana Baquero (Black Friday), Ariadna Gil (Nuts for Love), Sergi López (Dirty Pretty Thing), Maribel Verdú (Y tu mamá también) and Doug Jones (The Shape of Water).Every single aspect of this movie is perfect. The settings and circumstances are perfectly setup. The magical and mythical aspects are beautiful. The horror elements are intense and extremely well done. The military scenes are brilliantly depicted as well as the challenges of the time. There's so much gore in this it surprised me rewatching it and the conclusion comes out of nowhere and is perfect.This film will always be an underrated masterpiece that's up there with the greatest films all time. This is an absolute must see and an easy 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Ueber-Fantastic,"Pan's Labyrinth is one of the few movies I rate with a straight ten: a fantastic and unusual story, an outstanding cast (Ivana Baquero is incredible good as Ofelia), a superb cinematography and directing - simply put, a movie without any flaw. Everything composed like a well-balanced opera or a play by Shakespeare.Guillermo del Toro did with this movie one of the finest moments in movie history. Pan's Labyrinth belongs to me in the same league as movies like Metropolis, Apocalypse Now, Godfather etc.A must-see.

Del Toro at his best,"Of all his films, this is the standout for me. Devil's Backbone might be second.
The sorrow hits like a sledgehammer, but there is beauty and a wisp of optimism that is rare in anti fascist film (e.g. Seven Beauties, Amy of Shadows, Kanal, Come and See, etc).Really a perfect film that is mandatory viewing for anyone who cares about movies",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Cool fx and weird fantasy world steal the show,"Awesome special effects are the best thing about this film from writer/director/ producer Guillermo del Toro. A little girl discovers a weird fantasy land that helps her cope with the pain and trouble all around her - an evil, macho, fascist stepfather, a seriously ill mother, and the Spanish Civil War raging in the woods outside of the estate/garrison that she recently moved into. It is an effective blend of fantasy and reality, but there is a problem. The fantasy world stuff is lively, creepy, and intense - but the ordinary world provides pretty standard violent melodrama, and is not as effective.

Magical in Style,"I have become a big fan of Guillermo del Toro ever since watching Pan's Labyrinth and Shape of Water. Where Guillermo lacks plot-line, he makes up for in style and cinematic beauty. I dont think the story line of Pan's Labyrinth is fantastic per say, it definitely felt very loosely written, and I did not expect the film to be so heavily based around the war and so little on the actual labyrinth. But regardless, Guillermo's cinematic style is absolutely astounding. The fantastic creatures, the art, and the mood in each scene captivates how magical Ophelia's fantasy world was. I will forever love Guillermo's 40's-50's vibe in his films",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

"Pan's Labyrinth is a charming film, both visually, for the good use of effects and makeup, and for its narrative with high doses of analytical psychology, symbolic imagination","The film opens with dreamlike images where the voiceover of a narrator is heard, as if we were all the time watching a fable unfold before us. Many aesthetic-narrative aspects are important in Pan's Labyrinth: the two worlds, the real and the imaginary, are well demarcated in the film with very specific dramatic intensities. The Real World is marked by strong scenes of violence with the right to torture, sadism, hemorrhages, torn jaws and subsequently sewn together and many gunshots. The Imaginary World lived by Ophelia is marked by very intense discoveries that begin to happen when she enters the Labyrinth of the Faun, guided by a mysterious insect. Her encounter with Fauno and her fantastic characterization recalls many encounters in Fairy Tales such as Beauty and the Beast and Little Red Riding Hood with the Wolf, all with an implicit erotic content. The transformation of a repellent praying mantis into a fairy is reminiscent of Wendy's encounter with Peter Pan's Fairy Tinkerbell, not to mention the more direct and referent readings such as Alice in Wonderland and The Thousand and One Nights, with the references contained in the words of the Faun who claims that Ophelia is a Princess of the Underground World.The upward curve of Ophelia's symbolic challenges into the unknown, which no adult shares, has real counterpoints. It is similar to the fragility of your mother's health condition, which is constantly intensifying. At the same time, her ritualistic trajectory follows a movement parallel to the intensification of combat between the military and the rebels, who are trying to defeat the forces of the authoritarian government eager for power in Spain. Ophelia must complete magical missions to save herself from the violent reality that surrounds her. In the midst of these tests, she has a disgusting encounter with a gigantic frog and, with a magic chalk, enters a world inhabited by a surrealistic monster with sharp nails and eyes in her hands, which provides the viewer with one of the most original sequences in the history of Fantastic cinema, with impressive composition and finishing. The work of photography director Guillermo Navarro in Pan's Labyrinth is exquisite. He manages to create textures and chromatic tensions varied and perfectly placed in each situation in the film, whether in a dinner scene, in a scene of extreme horror and torture, or in a purely surreal scene, he creates atmospheres that often come close of the virtuosity of Baroque Painting.Del Toro's beautiful script exceptionally aligns these three nuclei, transforming them into a single narrative block that constantly alternates reality and fantasy, leaving the final reading of what really happened with Ophelia to the spectator. That is, it is the public's task to understand if she really came into contact with the fantastic, arising from the mythical nature unattainable by adults, or if her entire story was not the result of her own imagination, in a psychic tactic of denial and self-defense against family tragedy that befell his life. The structure of The Labyrinth of the Faun follows in the footsteps of traditional fairy tales, but rescues the violent and primitive essence of its original versions, written by names like Charles Perrault and the Grimm brothers and which Hollywood eliminated in its properly sanitized productions. Ophelia plays with this fact when she receives the first visit of a fairy, whose insect form is not very reminiscent of the figure in her children's storybook. The art direction builds the entire dark and swampy atmosphere of the film, displaying all the effluvia and emanations of an ancestral nature, prior to the political and social reality in which the film is based.The work is so far from what fairy tales have become that the kindest beings do not necessarily introduce themselves to Ophelia in a friendly way. The faun himself, a hybrid of man, tree and goat, is gesturally much rougher and more irascible than might be expected. Upon failing in her second task, the girl receives a rather fierce reprimand from her messenger to the underworld. The creature exhibits the rusticity of a true herald of nature, which puts Ophelia in contact with the ancestry that the feature film rescues as the central point of the story. The excellent mime actor Doug Jones plays both Guillermo del Toro's faun and the terrifying Pale Man, which guarantees one of the film's most harrowing passages. His bodywork is careful in every detail, ranging from the exotic posture and gait of his characters to the heteroclic way in which the Pale Man grope around him, looking for his own eyes, which he grotesquely inserts into the palms of his hands.Cleverly, Del Toro transports his argument to the field. Surrounded by forests, the public is comfortable in accepting that there may be a mythical universe out there. Surrounding this universe are the hard fences of the real world, a characteristic that also marks the work of other fantastic directors, such as Tim Burton and Terry Gilliam. The only different ingredient in Del Toro's film is the surrealist touches inherited from Spanish filmmaker Luis Buñuel, another who used his work to criticize the fascists. This dreamlike and gothic universe is the backbone of the film. Del Toro does not delimit what is fantasy or reality. He points out paths and lets the public embark on the trip of their choice. Even in the conclusion, Del Toro contrasts the two worlds. The viewer is able to choose based on their personal beliefs. Anyone who does not believe in fairies, legends and mythology will not feel cheated. Optimists who still see hope in the chaotic world we live in will be pleased. And this duality is evident in Ofelia's personality. It shows that perhaps the best way to escape reality is to create a fantasy world.Filmmaker Guillermo Del Toro presents a dark fable filled with metaphors and allegories. In addition to being pure entertainment, the film is also a great mental meal for moviegoers and lovers of fantastic literature. It's easy to find references to movies like The Shining, The Legend of the Headless Knight, The Wizard of Oz, Hellboy (by Del Toro himself) and books like Alice in Wonderland and the aforementioned fables by Hans Christian Andersen and the Brothers Grimm. In Del Toro's script, the difference between Ofelia's world and Vidal's is evident. She believes in dreams and fantasy, feelings and vital characteristics for human development. Vidal is a product of a rigid and fascist world. His ideology is based on violence. Del Toro takes the opportunity to analyze psychologically how men of this nature are the result of an aggressive and abusive relationship between their parents. But the debate is not just social, but also political. Vidal fails to see the rebels as a threat. For him, it's a matter of time for everyone to be eliminated. In The Devil's Spine (2001), Del Toro had already used children to present political themes as a backdrop - the same Spanish Civil War. The two films complete each other in meaning. And Del Toro's message is not about the loss of innocence, but about how we have to embrace it in order to survive emotionally.The actors are other important figures for the development of the story, especially Ivana Baquero, the young woman who plays Ophelia. At just twelve years old, Ivana has demonstrated that she possesses more depth than many more experienced actresses. Just the girl's gaze reminds us of something mysterious and melancholy. Practically every scene in the film counts with the presence of Baquero, who did not disappoint at any time. Ariadna Gil, responsible for playing the character Carmen, mother of the protagonist, is another one that deserves to be highlighted. She captured the essence of her role, bringing her pains, apparently forgotten, as she really tried, after the death of Ophelia's father, to continue life with another man, even if she didn't come to love him. Sergi López, Captain Vidal, is another who, in a strong and sure way, emphasizes his character, helping him to be rejected by spectators.In this work, fantasy and reality end up intertwining in such a way that there comes a certain moment in history when we no longer know if what is happening is happening in the real or fantastic planes. And as the end of the film is open, it is up to the viewer to choose between one or the other, or even both. But those who think that the film is childish are wrong: when Vidal, the captain, is described as ""sadistic"" it is because he is, and some scenes involving the battle between the military and the rebels are quite violent and graphic. On the other hand, the film balances violence with the lightness provided by Ofelia's arc and her exploration into the fantastic world.In short, Pan's Labyrinth is a charming film, both visually, for the good use of effects and makeup, and for its narrative, which has won us over since the beginning. Labyrinth of the Fauno is not a film for children, but for adults - let that be made clear! In his well-dosed mix of horror, fantasy, historical drama, the director has created a work that can be enjoyed by both the most ardent and demanding fans of the Fantastic Cinema, for those who enjoy bloody and artistically well-crafted scenes, and also by connoisseurs of the so-called Cinema of European Art. Del Toro has created a film of many intensities of emotion, wonder and horror that won't leave any viewer indifferent after watching ecstatic the end credits soar across the cinema screen as the powerful images of the film seethe in his head.With the courage to tackle a scathing children's drama with a political background and archetypal traits, free from any corny traces or empty sentimentality, and adorning the film with high doses of analytical psychology, symbolic imagination and visual effects that enhance the fantastic content of the work, Del Toro presents in this work one of his best productions.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Let the movie guides our imagination.,"To be honest, the first time I listened to the name of this movie, i never imagined anything like this, because i used have the bad habit to judge before to see. Anyway it seems to me now that i'm a fanatic of these kind of movies, that the context of a real world can make us more and more imaginative, beyond the things we believe and thought. For me this is a weird but beautiful example of the power of imagination that the director Del Toro can give us. I didn't remember what exactly did I do when movie finished, i just smiled, watched the credits scrolling, heard the beautiful music and then i put the movie on its box. Nothing else. Something happened. I can't describe that effect that Pan's Labyrinth gave me to me, but it was beautiful. Cry or smile, or cry while smiling. Only a genius could make that piece of cinematographic art. I liked for many reasons. One of them, it's spoken in Spanish, the atmosphere of tension that comes together when the war combined with a strong Spanish accent gives emotion to the movie. And then, the tranquility. All the actors getting deep into his character. A combined rhythm that shows different contexts of two different worlds. Doesn't matter what you believe, it's your choice. I recommend this movie for those who want to see something weird, but something that can prove itself the worth of a young soul. There's a prequel, which is based in the same context. (The devil's backbone). The idea of have a child on the main character for me is such as see the innocent life turned into something that they wouldn't be able to do.That's why i loved it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
An incredible exploration of the imagination of Del Toro,"Unique, very well crafted adult fairy tale. The fantasy component, while not getting much screen time, is effective at conveying an interesting twist in the genre. It's an incredible fusion, and features some awesome character designs. Performances across the board are effective and at times powerful. The original score is also moving, fitting the action perfectly.Granted, Pan's Labyrinth is fairly bizarre but is more than approachable. It is a spellbinding tale of love, sacrifice, and courage that is incredibly memorable. If only we got a further glimpse deeper into the mind of Del Toro, this movie would be perfect.

Some People Can't Escape Their Fate,"I haven't liked a single Guillermo Del Toro film that I've seen. I didn't like Mimic, Blade II, or Hellboy. That's not all he's made, but that's three strikes. I felt like that would be the last of the Guillermo Del Toro films that I'd see, until Pan's Labyrinth comes along and gets tremendous praise. I thought, well it actually looks good, and I'm sure every director, even the lesser ones, has his day, and so I decided to see it. I saw it, and I was disappointed.The movie has atmosphere, which I always like. I like how the film never leaves the Spanish cabin and the woods that surround it. And I also enjoyed the magical creatures, the good ones and the bad ones, when they were actually shown. The problem with the movie is that it's so uneven that you come in not really fully knowing what to expect and then somehow leave with the feeling that you haven't gotten what you expected.The film takes place during the Spanish Revolution, and attempts to center around one little girl's adventure into a world of fairies, gods, and heavenly creatures, the Revolution being the antagonist that may keep her from reaching the etherial life as the princess of this world. This is hardly effective because the movie is 80% Revolution and 20% fantasy. The audience is subjected to waiting through scenes, even violent and action-packed ones, instead of enjoying them. This is not because these scenes are badly done or boring, but because we didn't come to see a movie about the Spanish Revolution and the evil of the little girl's warlord father. We came to see a fantasy. The scenes of fantasy are very enjoyable, but in all, they probably add up to about a half hour. The remaining hour and a half is lost focus.Pan's Labyrinth is uneven in many other ways, too. For instance, it's a fantasy about a little girl, but it's rated R. The film is advertised like any other fantasy film, much less a fantasy film about a little girl, and there's nothing R-rated about it. So when we see that R rating, what are we to expect? Right up until the second I sat down in the theater, I had no idea what I was seeing. All I knew was that it was called Pan's Labyrinth. And it's because the movie doesn't know what it is, what it's about, or who it's about. Is it a fantasy about a little girl, or is it a drama, or is it both, or is it one overlapping another? Is it about a fantasy world, or is it about the Spanish Revolution, or is it one overlapping another? Is it about the little girl or is it about her father?Maribel Verdu's performance is terrific, as is that of Sergi Lopez, Ivana Boquero, and Ariadna Gil, and the cinematography is beautiful, capturing the atmosphere I speak of, but they hardly effect one who is watching a completely unfocused story. I think that's the end of the line for Guillermo Del Toro in my book. I gave him one more big chance after three strikes, and he still couldn't quite cut it. Benicio Del Toro is a fine actor, but his brother should maybe work for a publishing company or something.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
A fantasy with brutal reality,"Pan's Labyrinth is one of those movies that carries a message through its visuals and even tells a story with few words. Many of the images resemble fear, greed, happiness, and despair. No one is safe when you go astray from the path you were meant to be on. I absolutely loved the direction in this flick. Every shot seemed to be tight, focused, and captured the mood the scene is creating. Obviously the visuals is what makes this movie so amazing and it deserves that merit. the use of makeup and real set pieces rather than the CGI saturated world we live in now is why I will always love this movie.

Sheer Brilliance,"Pan's labyrinth is a truly wonderful experience and right from the start the viewer is treated to some beautiful visuals. But this film is a lot more than just being pretty to look at and beyond the excellent visuals, the viewer is treated to a captivating story.The main star of the film is Ofelia (played by Ivana Baquero) and considering she was only 12 years old when the film was made I thought her acting was really good - arguably the only acting that was as good as/better than Baquero's was Sergi Lopez whose performance as the evil captain Vidal (Ofelia's step-dad) was also excellent. We also have Mercedes (played by Maribel Verdu) Carmen (Ofelia's mum - played by Ariadna Gil) and the doctor (played by Alex Angulo) in supporting roles.Another of the film's strengths is the pacing - although the film is nearly 2 hours long, you won't even notice the time passing - the film's main plot covers Ofelia and her fairytale world within the Labyrinth and we also have a sub plot involving Captain Vidal and his war against 'The Guerillas'.Pan's labyrinth is beautiful to look at, has a wonderful story, is well acted with a strong script.

Timeless fairy tale,"I think Guillermo del Toro has achieved what he wanted to do: to create a tale that is authentic, that feels old, told for generations before reaching us.Not only that, but as a film, it stands very high in terms of: an engaging story with beautiful cinematography, well crafted decor and period costumes.The actors are well chosen; we follow Ofelia as the protagonist and we are truly by her side from start to finish which reinforces the impact of her discoveries and trials, both in the post civil war Spain and in the magical realm.It is a story that contains many emotions like a true fairy tale, guiding us through the best and worst of human nature from the innocent and imaginative point of view of a 10 years old in time of war.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
A light-weight but interesting film.,"This interweaves a dark children's fairytale with an simple adult war story and the effect does leave you wondering why bother merging them? The cynical answer is that neither story is good enough or substantial enough to stand on it's own!The stories are both quite simple with very little dialogue.The fairytale is a very old-fashioned story of a lost fairy princess trying to regain her throne and is done well although I had heard before watching it that it was visually stunning and was a little disappointed that it isn't, it is visually interesting but certainly not stunning.The war story is also nothing new, a vicious soldier trying to hunt down the rebels while there are spies in his camp.The only original thing in the film is the mixing of the two stories and this is done very well with dark scenes in reality being played on top of dark fantasy scenes and the mounting desperation of Ofelia to escape her life.The acting is good with Baquero causing none of the annoyances that often occur when children star in adult films, the rest of the cast deliver good performances keeping you interested and giving some depth to the war story.The ending is surprising and consistent although with a little compromise to the dark theme of the rest of the film.The problem is that the film is insubstantial, neither story line is memorable on it's own and joining them doesn't do enough to raise the film above the level of a curiosity. Worth seeing but nothing to get excited about.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
"An excellent film, albeit strongly politicized.","I think this film was really my first contact with the work of Guillermo del Toro, a Mexican director who has done a colossal job of taking advantage of fantastic themes in his films. This film was one of the director's most cherished projects, and we can feel how much he committed and invested in it. Despite being a fantasy film and starring a girl, the film is quite intense and not suitable for younger children.All the action takes place in the final years of the Spanish Civil War: we follow Ofelia, a dreamy and kind-hearted girl, who travels to a remote place in rural Spain with her mother, in order to join Captain Vidal, a superior officer of the Francoist army whose mother got pregnant and who occupied an abandoned mill with a battalion to hunt down a group of communist partisans. From the start, it is quite clear that Ofelia dislikes her stepfather and her mother is determined to make her forget her real father, now deceased, by forcing the girl to treat him as a father. Indifferent to political issues, Ofelia pursues and finds a magical world in the forest around her new habitat. There, she meets a faun who tells her that she is, in fact, a princess, daughter of the King of the Enchanted World, who long ago left and was lost in the human world, living without knowing the anguish and longing for her true father. In order to return, she will need to complete three challenges and prove that her soul is still pure, that is, that she has not turned into a human.If we want to do a cold and harshly realistic analysis, this film will quickly crumble and show several weaknesses. The most obvious, for me, is the absolute insanity of a military man who insists on taking his companion, in a terminal stage of pregnancy, and a minor child to the battlefield. I also didn't like the feeling that the film ends up being so politically charged, with communist guerrillas being considered champions of freedom and with the demonization of Francoist soldiers. Anyone knows that there are no saints in war, and that atrocities are always committed on both sides. But I feel that we are being unfair if we continue to view the film from this perspective. Despite all this, this is a charming cinematographic work full of magic and dreaminess, which makes us want to believe in fairy tales again, to be in that girl's shoes.The film has an excellent cast of Hispanic actors (I don't know if they are all Spanish in fact) and is entirely spoken in Spanish, which for me was a bonus as it gives the film a very welcome additional realism. Ivana Baquero did an exceptional job on the skin of young Ofelia. Despite not showing his face, very well disguised, Doug Jones is the man who gives body, soul and life to two of the most memorable characters in the film: the wise faun and the terrible Pale Man, a monster that almost devours the protagonist. Jones gives us one of his best works in cinema. Surprisingly calm and terrifying, Sergi López turned his Captain into a character worthy of our hatred and contempt. In addition to these three great actors, the film also has splendid performances by Ariadna Gil, Maribel Verdú, Álex Angulo and César Vea.Being a Del Toro film, it is guaranteed that we will have a wide range of visual effects, CGI and characterization, all the highest quality and privileging the maximum of realism. In fact, we couldn't ask for more when it comes to all of this. There are a number of discreet and realistic CGI features, ranging from explosions and the intense green of the forest to the maze itself, fantastic and unreal, where an important part of the story takes place. The costumes are very good, especially Ofelia's dresses and the soldiers' uniforms. The scenarios, especially the labyrinth and the mill, are wonderful and the characterization of the fantastic characters was thought out in the smallest details. Cinematography makes clever use of color, shadow, light and shooting angles to achieve greater expressiveness and visual symbolism. No less important is the excellent soundtrack, with emphasis on the central melody, which has a sound that reminds us of the lullabies that mothers used to sing to children.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

Beautiful masterpiece,"This film is truly brilliant. I could spend this entire review gushing about how wonderful I think it is, but will try to be more precise.The plot is beautifully constructed, juxtaposing seamlessly between a reality without hope and the fantasy that offers a light at the end of the tunnel. The acting was superb throughout – the young Ivana Baquero shows remarkable skill in bringing the character of Ofelia to life, and we really can believe and enter into her distress and fear. The haunting music was a perfect backdrop to the action, enhancing the despair of the situation. The effects are excellent and believable.Whether or not the audience is supposed to believe that Ofelia is imagining things or whether it is really happening, seems to me to be ultimately irrelevant. What the audience is looking at is the idea of hope rising out of despair, in the person of a little girl who believes in magic.

A masterpiece.,"Guillermo del Toro has crafted a masterpiece, a brutal, terrifying fairytale for adults who watch in anticipation as the events in the film unfold. The lead features a strong, adventurous child named Ofelia who discovers a Faun and that a fairytale world. It is everything she dreamt of.This remarkable film spins a tale about a little girl trapped between a dream world of ghouls and real-life monsters during the Spanish Civil War, and it works remarkably well, simultaneously enchanting and horrifying with almost every frame. It's dark and horrifying appealing to an older audience yet shows the hardships of that time.The actors are all stable in their roles and Doug Jones as the El Fauno is stunning. The costumes are something else that entice me, especially El Fauno who looks as though he is part of the Earth from which he probably came. There are roughly 2 plot lines running in parallel; the military-resistance story and the princess fantasy story. Both move back and forth as needed. Each storyline connects smoothly and is easy for the audience to follow.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
"Brilliant, Touching, Brutal Fantasy","I'm not sure why I have never watched this before. It has everything. It is touching, brutal, historical, magical, great dialogue, superb acting... If you have never watched this film you must do so, but don't be fooled... it is far from a child's fantasy fairy tale... quite bloody and graphic at times. I would not watch it with anyone of school age....having said that, for adults, this is a masterpiece...",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Not that Amazing,"Pan's Labyrinth was a total shocker. From the previews, I was expecting a fairy tale. I literally thought I was in for fairies, goblins, and all manner of fantastical creatures. Sure, there was some of that in PL... but this is no kids film.I was blown away by the sheer violence and gore. Don't get me wrong, I love a good bloodbath film, but this just seemed a bit too gratuitous. The story itself was okay, but in reality it was just a retelling of an old theme with added gore.One of the reasons I watch films is to be surprised... to not know what to expect... to have a film lead me somewhere as I follow engrossed in it all. The only thing that wasn't standard ""I know what comes next"" fare were the occasional bouts of violence. I have seen both storytelling and violence handled much better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
if you don't do subtitles don't watch this movie,"This movie is one of the greatest ever made. The visual effects are some of the most engaging and impressive that I have seen and I have seen a lot of movies. It is not so much impressive in the way that CG is in Avatar but it is on it's own level. You just have to see it to understand. The story is very heavy and powerful. Some scenes were so shocking and powerful that I was actually shaking. There are horror movies that deal with strange and unlikely things like zombies, and don't get me wrong I love a good zombie or vampire movie. However, a film like this one that deals with war in a very smart and real way has a much bigger impact when something really bad happens than a movie that is clearly make believe. This movie deals with make believe and the surreal in a way that few other movies have been able to pull off well. What Dreams Come attempted this and did not quite hit the mark, this movie does a much better job of contrasting and blending what is real and what is imagination. Brilliant, brilliant movie. If you have a problem with subtitles do not waste your time, you will be disappointed and want to give the movie an unfair low rating which is an ignorant English speaking person thing to do. If you can deal with subtitles, watch this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Very beautiful but the violence didn't help the movie in any way.,"This movie was an interesting experience. The camera-work is gorgeous, the effects very nice, good acting too. I mean it. But the movie has some REALLY serious flaws too, no question about it. A movie about fantasy in a way misses its point when it makes you think of computer animations and latex puppets. The story has to be grounded in primarily in the viewers *emotions* not in the senses that reaches ear and eye. In the first Star Wars movies the effects was great at the time but it was the saga, the tale that made one keep thinking about it for weeks after leaving the cinema. That wont happen with this film even if it is quite good. Visuals cant alone create that, and it shouldn't, a audience that confuse surface with deep, lay ground to an empty shallow and scary cultural scenario.Also and more importantly...the intensity of the depicted violence can never replace the overall intensity of the movie experience. I think everybody somewhere know that that is a very very cheap trick. Still the monkey in man begin to clap hands when seeing the violence in sin city or 300, just for the sake of violence. The problem with the visual torture in this movie was that it felt so unnecessary. Sometimes violence can improve a movie, like in Shindlers list, (but if that movie had been a gore-movie like ""Passion of the Christ"", it would have teased our disgust more than our hearts. The jackass guys can disgust us, but they cant touch our deeper feelings because that takes intelligence and very hard artistic work.) Maybe the whole point with the gore in this film was to make people like me complain about it. Of course it will work, the day it wont, the world will be even worse than now. I know people that has been tortured in war, and don't find the idea of people watch the fiction of that as nice entertainment while eating popcorn very inspiring, or even as a good cultural sign. It should be easy to make the tale more adult without just adding violence, i mean, why not more complexity or depth instead? The movie was a good one anyway, but it could have been a true masterpiece if it had touched us even deeper with its storyline. See it yourself and get your own opinion.I rate it 6.5 of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

"Del Toro's Imaginative Film, El Laberinto del Fauno","Del Toro's Imaginative Film, El Laberinto del Fauno
 El Laberinto Del Fauno was directed in 2006 by Guillermo del Toro. Filming took place in various parts of Spain. Although the film's language is primarily in Spanish, it is also popularly known for its English title Pan's Labyrinth. Guillermo del Toro is famously known for his other works such as Hellboy, Blade II, and Pacific Rim. He is versatile in his works and takes on imaginative endeavours. Not only is Del Toro a film director, but he has also taken on roles as a screenwriter, producer and novelist. In all of his contributions to the films he's taken part of, his trademark can be noted by creatures with inhuman features, clockworks designs, use of insects and screens with amber hues. The elements of Del Toro's trademarks can be found throughout parts of El Laberinto del Fauno as well. 
The film is a combination of historical war, fantasy and drama. The narrative structure of the film at first, appears to be a circular plot with two storylines. The setting takes place in what appears to be the historical 1940's in Spain. One imagines a war torn countryside and a lot of action. However, one of the story's depth unfolds when a fantasy world arises. A world where fairies, a faun and magical objects or beings exist. At the center of the plots are three major female characters; Ofelia, Carmen and Mercedes. Ofelia is a child played by Ivana Baquero, her perspective leads the film viewers through both the ""real world"" filled with war torn issues and into her eerie, fantastical adventures. During that time Mercedes, who is played by Maribel Verdu grows close to Ofelia, as she also remains resilient during the war torn times. Carmen is Ofelia's pregnant mother, played by Ariadna Gil. In the story it is evident that Ofelia, Carmen and Mercedes are burdened by the expectations held for woman in the 1940's. The male antagonist in the film is Captain Vidal, he is played by Sergi Lopez and is portrayed as strong, callous and sadistic. As the two stories continue, viewers are taken through multiple perspectives like a colorful and magical place, with Ofelia. And then viewers are transitioned to the historical world where propaganda is used to keep civilians ""happy"" or content, while fascist regimes live their lives in riches. This part of the storyline in El Laberinto del Fauno is a great interpretation of historical war and gender roles that occured during that time. Del Toro's use of two ongoing storylines shows the best of both fantasy genre and historical war genre. 
This film is effective in its interpretation and for the brilliant technical aspects. Something that was especially clever is the way that the two stories transitioned through the lighting on the screen. It went from hues of amber, to a more natural light. This element lead the viewer back and forth through the far-fetched fantasy world and the war torn, historical world. The profound characteristics of all the characters also made the film feel genuine. As a viewer, you had the opportunity to empathize with the characters and their struggles. Del Toro was also successful in conveying his trademarks, such as the fixation that Captain Vidal had for his pocket watch. Also, the mythical creatures with striking and almost frightening features. It's important to note that from the beginning scene, where Ofelia appears to be hurt and lying on the floor, it becomes obvious that this is far from being a children's fairytale. Because of this, I do have to admit that this film is better suited for a mature audience. 
Overall I would highly recommend this film, because it is unworldly imaginative. The narrative structure seamlessly guides the viewer through the stories. And it's ingenuity lies within taking the viewer, not only to a different era but also to a different land. This film works for viewers who enjoy historical war films and also for viewers who love the fantasy side of filming. In short, this film has the best of both worlds.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
"""I've seen a fairy.""","I don't see very many Mexican movies which I think are great.Though I would never own Pan's Labyrinth, I do think this is a great one, deserving all the recognition that it got, and I'm very impressed, and even proud that the movie is Mexican.The story is very simple, yet it embraces several different themes with class, and style.It is, essentially, a children's story set in Spain during World War ll, and centering around Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), a lonely little girl who's mother is carrying the child of a fascist named Captain Vidal.Vidal could care less about his new wife and stepdaughter, and focuses solely on the child whom, he is certain will be a boy.Because it is a difficult pregnancy, the mother is forced to stay bedridden, and Ofelia is placed in the care of Mercedes (Maribel Verdu), a caring woman who quietly despises Vidal, and has been secretly plotting against him.Then, one night, Ofelia follows a fairy into a labyrinth on her stepfather's estate.There she meets a Fawn (Doug Jones) who tells her she is a Princess, the daughter of a great King in an underground land, and that she must pass three tests if she is to return to her Kingdom, and be reunited with her true family...Ofelia agrees, but trouble looms on the horizon, as rebels that have gone against the Nazi regime, unite against Vidal, and the three tests (which seem to Ofelia to be simple) could ultimately destroy her.This movie is enchanting, and strangely soothing.It's a fairy tale with depth, told from several points of view, and which comes up for air every once in a while to reflect on tyranny of the Nazi regime. Ofelia's mother, who's probably going to die in childbirth. Mercedes, who would like nothing better than to see Vidal dead. And Vidal himself, who's determined that his legacy should live on through his son.A really, really terrific movie.
A masterpiece, I dare say, by Guillermo del Toro.

I am not a critic or a movie expert, but there is something about this movie which captures you and then you feel part of the whole setting.

Excessive fawning over an interesting but puzzling film...,"Yes, UK critic Mark Kermode went overboard about it, but his is one voice. (And he was wrong about the Borat movie, too, as far as I was concerned.)Firstly, this is a very well made film, of that there's little doubt. Both the reality and fantasy elements are technically faultless. But as my wife and I were left puzzling after watching this film, ""Why?""If you separated the Reality element from the Fantasy you'd be left with two stories, one about a young girl and her troubles with a masochistic stepfather who is struggling with his father relationship (or lack of it) and is fixated on the production of a son. This is told well, if simplistically, and in excessively brutal detail. (Scenes of torture, disfigurement and other graphic violence.) Running concurrently with this is the same girl's introduction to her role as a Princess in the Fantasy world.What was the connection between them? I couldn't see it. All other aspects of the storytelling were unsophisticated, (the role of the partisans and insiders, the inevitable breaking of the rules in the girl's fantasy ""test""), so the likelihood of some deep and subtle meaning seems unlikely.So you can have half an OK tale about the end of the Spanish Civil War, and half an OK fantasy tale. Intertwined, for no obvious reason. (But very well made, oh yes, I mentioned that already!)",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
"Guillermo Del Toro crafts an exuberant, yet nightmarish fantasy world, blending high-classed visuals with and storytelling with sobering history on the European front","Picture an adult version of 'Alice in Wonderland', add graphic violence and momentous themes to the mix, and you got yourself an accurate picture of Guillermo Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth (or El Laberinto del Fauno in Spanish). This film takes a high-classed fantasy genre and spins into a dark, twisted universe where fairy tales clash with the grim history of the European front during World War II. The results that transpire is an Alice in Wonderland-like adventure that strikes at the heart not with whimsical excitement or charm, but with its wicked twists and turns that captures the innocence of childhood diminished under the unforgiving history that defined our world today. Do not let the visuals fool you, this is by no means a kid-friendly adventure. It is very dark, very violent, and proceeds a sense of dread from beginning to end; and Del Toro has almost no doses of levity to offer in the bargain. On the upside, the scarcity of child-friendly themes is what makes this high-classed fantasy tale so unique. The film is set in 1944 during the Spanish Civil War when Spain was being overrun by fascism. Following the death of her father who was killed in the war, 11-year old Ofelia (played by Ivana Baquero), a fairy tale obsessed youngster, moves with her mother (played by Ariadna Gil), who is growing ill from her pregnancy, to the country side of Spain to escape the chaos. There, she meets her new stepfather Captain Vidal (played by Sergi Lopez), a fascist army officer with a sadistic edge, and Vidal's housekeeper Mercedes (played by Meribel Verdu) who she grows a close bond with. On night, Ofelia is awoken by a fairy who leads her to a mysterious labyrinth where she meets a giant faun (voiced by Doug Jones). Upon meeting, she learns she is the princess of a magical kingdom, but must prove her loyalty by completing three unpleasant tasks before the full moon rises. As the war atrocities rage on and the lines between reality and fantasy begin to dissolve, Ofelia is pitted in a ruthless battle that threatens to tear both her and her family apart.Guillermo Del Toro wields a masterful hand at pulling us into his world where dreams turn to nightmares and fantasy morphs into horrifying reality. Rich in electrifying storytelling and powerful in balancing his signature visual methodology with hard-hitting substance, the film takes you on a ride that is vastly unpredictable with plenty of scares and thrills to fill the mix. The story operates on the base of the Spanish Civil War in which the action, beautifully shot by Del Toro, is intertwined back and forth with the lead character Ofelia's interaction with the fantasy world and the effects it leads on both her and her ailing mother. As Captain Vidal's tyranny ravages their home land, a gruesome battle between good and evil rages on to the point where all bets are off and the fate of each character could be the worst imaginable scenario. And the beauty of Del Toro's storytelling is that he never lets any moment go to waste nor does he make the critical mistake of allowing his nightmarish visuals tower over his narrative, especially when offering a solid history lesson on the atrocities of war in the European front. The fairies and the monsters, all of which are done by CGI, are astounding, yet scary to look at. We are talking about pale-skinned monster with no eyes on his side, but on the palm of his hands. The performances by Ivana Baquero and Meribel Verdu are amazing, but perhaps not enough to match up with Sergi Lopez's grim performance as Captain Vidal, the ruthless Hitler-like army officer who splatters the screen with his blood-stained demeanor. Each time he is on screen, the sense of discomfort fills the air.Pan's Labyrinth is an exuberantly crafted fantasy tale, constructed by the hands of Guillermo Del Toro who offers a near-flawless blend of twisted visual methodology and sobering history of the war in Spain. It is a high-classed fantasy that places a landmark on its genre in more ways than one. It is a definite must-see, but only for mature audiences. If you are a parent and make the ill-advised decision of letting your children sit through this, well, do not be surprised if you find them sneaking in bed with you in the middle of the night.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Modern day fairytale,"This film is an interesting synthesis between a Franco era war film and a dark fantasy fairytale story. In some ways it reminds me of Spirited Away in that it features a young girl sucked into a fantasy otherworld with a lot of symbolism and interpretations.

The art design and mythological feeling are amazing, and even better, they feed into an overall significance that is more than the sum of its parts.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
THE adult fairy tale.,"El laberinto del fauno (2006)This film, directed by Guillermo del Toro based on his own original screenplay is set in mid-twentieth-century Spain, which was under the rule of Francisco Franco and his dictatorship. Stared by Ivana Baquero in the lead role of Ofelia, it tells us her story; a girl that loves fairy tales and lives absentminded in her own fictional world, while her mother faces the cruel reality of being subjugated to her husband, a Captain in Franco's sadistic army. Ofelia is met with some whimsical yet arduous challenges. Meanwhile horror keeps spreading in the side story between her mom and her uncle, a renegade soldier who created a rebel faction in furtherance of planning an uprising against the regime.The cast, just like in every other critically acclaimed film, seems to be full of faultless picks for each position, even though it's mainly Spanish. Parts like captain Vidal, portrayed by Serji Lopez, offer stunning performances that leave us wondering how these actors are not a-list celebrities. It blends a variety of different film genres into a beautiful cinematic cocktail. Fantasy and drama with a little bit of historical nuances on the side. It's a fairy-tale for adults. Fanciful but nevertheless gory, as could and should be expected by a proper del Toro fan. Do not watch if you are prone to vomiting as there are some harsh scenes in this flick, but do watch if you like adrenaline, since the film uses childhood innocence for face value but maintains an underlying tone of suspense that is guaranteed to put you regularly on the edge of your seat. Costume designers and editors must not be forgotten considering they merged real props with special effects in such a balanced way one could start questioning whether or not some mystic beings are in fact only a product of medieval folklore. As the plot thickens we start seeing how things aren't as simple as they once seemed and the world Ofelia lives in starts to feel real to us viewers. Or maybe we just start using our minds as a defence mechanism against the chaos and sorrow of the ""real"" world we are presented with, so dispiriting it makes us want to escape it. The film revolves around this idea of what's real or fake without ever being conclusive. So it's up to you to decide what to believe in. I consider this to be a film like no other in the sense that it unpretentiously delivers a dichotomy of strong feelings and seemingly incompatible genres all mashed up into 180 minutes of jaw - dropping cinematography. So, for me, whether you are a film buff or a just casual viewer, this is indisputably a must watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

Disappointed,"Very disappointing. I went into this movie prepared to see a fantasy, not a violent war movie. Someone told me that it would rip my heart out in a good way. There was no heart ripping. Basically zero emotions were provoked. I have no clue why so many people love this movie so much and were effected by it to the degree that they described. The fairytale aspects of this movie were old, recycled ideas that I've heard so many times that it even came across as trite to me. The movie wasn't gripping in any way besides the fact that I kept waiting for that famed ""heart rip"" that would happen that never delivered. Another thing that I didn't like was the portrayal of Pan. I thought for the amount of money that went into imagery, they could have done a better job with that character.6/10 for music, imagery,and the child actress, who was a remarkable actress and I'm looking forward to seeing her play in more roles, if that's where life takes her.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Good and Evil,"This was an ambitious project. The director was really aiming at producing something remarkable. And it does have beautiful moments, filled with intensity and visual poetry, something which warms a viewer but it is not immediately synonym to good cinema. Direct to it, i didn't really like this film, despite the overwhelming good reviews and sympathy of the audience. The narrative structure is clear and simple: we have a story that goes on in a ""real"" historical time, and we have another line which is ""magical"" and runs (maybe) in the head and vision of a little girl. The first thread should represent the cruelness and violence of the real world, right in the middle of a brutal war context; the second thread is the escape for those who are able to ""see"" magic, here impersonated by our little girl. She reads books, lots of them, story books, and those stories leak into the world she creates, representing this in fact the leaking del Toro intentionally wanted to make, crossing his own references and creating a magical world which is in fact a mist of several ""children"" stories. Well, the problem is here, to my view. Fernando Pessoa stated the paradox that a children's story should never be written for children. He meant that it should give juice to the minds of adult thinking as well. So, good children stories always include paradoxes, ambiguities and difficult decisions, remember Alice, remember Andersen, remember the Grimm, remember Sophia Mello Breyner... A good children's story, magical or not, is most of the times a synthesis of complex principles that exist in a grey world, beyond black and white. Well, here everything is black or white. You know, from beginning to the end what is good and what is bad, even the ""flaw"" of our little girl comes from disobeying, not through temptation. And this is a poor vision, to me, one that doesn't live up to the way all this was executed. Because there are very very strong moments here. The fantasy characters are really engaging, the Fauno is really engaging, the way its evolution is made as the film moves along, the character with eyes in his hands is a fantastic character, all that scene is brilliantly executed. And some references are really tender. The performances are good as well. But something just doesn't go well here, and that is what i mentioned. It's as if the winner of the war in the film was the captain, and who made this film thinks one sided, good-bad, by extremes, the way he would have taught his children... spooky.My opinion: 2/5 this will be a good visual experience, if you can forget the weaknesses i pointed out. i couldn't",,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Death marches on,"Do not let the title fool you: this Spanish import is not a traditional fantasy like LABRYNTH, WILLOW or LEGEND. Instead, it is a dark and extremely unpleasant look back at war-ravaged Spain in the 1940s. The young daughter of a brutish army officer begins to imagine herself in a dark realm, in order to escape real life. In her fantasy, she has to achieve a certain number of goals to be crowned queen of this bizarre realm. Meanwhile, the war rages on and her father kills virtually everyone in sight, sometimes sadistically. PAN has overtones of ALICE IN WONDERLAND, if Alice were on acid. The film is in Spanish with English subtitles, but it is pretty easy to follow. The CGI is mind-boggling, but the story is so death-obsessed, it doesn't really matter in the end. PAN is a nihilistic effort that goes much too far to present the horrors of war and the savagery of men. Approach with extreme caution, and no child under 13 should view this. It may be considered a masterpiece by the art-house crowd, but it is not a mainstream film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
I have had enough!!!,"I had an entirely different review for this movie written and posted, but after hearing more and more people comment on this ""mystical, haunted wonderland of a movie"", I had to re-write my comment, more out of anger than anything else. First, let me set some guidelines. This is a great movie. It was made with a lot of skill and talent, it is a different approach to story telling and there is a lot to be admired. However, one thing that I simply cannot stand anymore is how exponentially increasing masses of people keep calling this ""one of the best fantasy's ever"", ""a dark and horrific, yet wonderfully creative trip down the rabbit hole"". People, if this is one of the best fantasy's ever, or even of recent times, then all that means is our expectations of what a fantasy should be are sorely lacking. Throughout the entire movie, there are two, count them, TWO scenes that are pure fantasy, and neither one lasts more than perhaps four minutes. The rest of the fantasy takes place in real life situations with subtle hints of fantasy or one or two fantasy characters appearing to talk to the girl. Again, don't jump down my throat too quickly, these scenes are interesting to watch and for light touches of fantasy I think it was very well done, but by no means whatsoever can a movie that is 75% war drama and 25% fantasy, if that, be considered an ""enchanting and mysterious fairy tale"". If anything, it is a dark war drama with innovative and well crafted flairs of fantasy interwoven, but stop reviewing this movie in ways that are going to mislead people into thinking they are going to see a flood of creative and magical imagery!Possible SpoilersAs a final point, I think the biggest flaw in this movie is that I couldn't help but feel all the mystical elements of the story were, in the end, pointless. They in no way connect to the real world and are more like interesting side notes into the delusions of a little girl while the real world ticks on around her. Say what you will about the themes about losing one's innocence, and how the fantasy might have been real, either way there is a feeling of disappointment when the girl drops dead at the end and we think, ""why did she do all this again? What does this have to do with ANYTHING else we've seen in the movie?"" I was looking for a greater sense of importance to the girl's story. Perhaps the writers weren't going for that, which is fine, but it would have made the movie more enjoyable for me.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
My favorite film,"Pan's Labyrinth is a visually stunning and haunting film that masterfully weaves together the harsh realities of post-Civil War Spain with a dark, fantastical narrative. Directed by Guillermo del Toro, this film is an extraordinary blend of fairy tale and horror, creating a story that is as beautiful as it is unsettling.Set in 1944, the film follows a young girl named Ofelia, who is forced to move with her pregnant mother to a remote military outpost. There, she discovers a mysterious labyrinth and encounters a faun who reveals her true identity as a lost princess. The journey Ofelia embarks on is both magical and terrifying, filled with incredible creatures and challenging tasks that test her courage and resolve.What stands out most in is its breathtaking cinematography. Every frame is like a work of art, showcasing del Toro's incredible imagination. The visual effects are stunning, bringing the fantastical elements to life in a way that feels both real and otherworldly. The creature designs, especially the Pale Man and the Faun, are hauntingly beautiful, leaving a lasting impression.The film's themes of innocence, brutality, and the power of imagination are expertly woven throughout the narrative. **Pan's Labyrinth** challenges viewers to confront the darkness of the world while also highlighting the importance of hope and escapism. It's a poignant reminder of how stories can help us navigate the harsh realities of life.A masterclass in storytelling and visual artistry. It's a film that stays with you long after the credits roll, evoking a sense of wonder and melancholy.

You can hope...can't you?,"I cannot think of a single film that has stuck with me from the first time I watched it more than this one. Guillermo del Toro beautifully encapsulates what it may feel like to be a young girl dealing with change, death, and tragedy on a day-to-day basis. It pretends to be a fairytale taking place in the heart of Fascist Spain but instead, it describes what it feels like to be a young girl living in that society, the fairytales are her coping mechanism, her way of explaining and living in everything that happens around her. I could say so much more, but this is only a review and I haven't the time.I'll leave it with a simple point.

One of my biggest influences in the Fantasy genre,"Guillermo Del Toro worked his ass off, creating this film, and the outcome is absolutely breathtaking. This is one of my favorite films of all time. It's suspenseful. It's tear-jerking. It's thrilling. It's has you engaged from beginning to end. The best part of this movie is that it's a Spanish spoken film. A lot of foreign language movies in America are completely overlooked because of the other movies that are being advertised, but Pan's Labyrinth doesn't do that. It stays in your mind forever.

Truly a work perfectly done.,"I'm so happy to have watched this film after being slightly discouraged that it is spanish audio. But i couldn't have been more wrong, the dialogue and audio feel so in sync with the events and atmosphere of the movie. Guillermo Del Toro is a GENIUS.

whats all the fuss about?,"With crazy characters, teasing trailers, amazing posters and from various magazines more stars than the night sky I was really looking forward to this film. Sadly for me it didn't live up to the expectation. Overly long but with hardly any character development it looks pretty but is actually quite boring. Set in Spain at a time of upheaval the film flips between the real world and that of a fantasy realm created by Ofelia, who along with her pregnant mother go to live in a rural area will the evil Captain Vidal, not her father but the father to her unborn brother. From the outset we quickly establish that Vidal is a nasty piece of work who only cares about the baby and victory over his enemies at any cost. Ofelia trapped between the captain, the fighting and her ill mother retreats into a made up world where she will be a princess if she completes three tasks given to her by the faun Pan. What follows is a story of the civil unrest in Spain, violence and all, with occasional dips in to Ofelia's vivid imagination as escape. The trouble is that when in Ofelia's mind we are treated to some of the most beautiful CGI committed to screen but its too few and far between to call this a modern day Alice in wonderland. Pan the faun is probably in the two hour film no more than ten minutes if you add together his screen time and the eye hand guy that dominates a lot of the posters and screen shots is only in it for a couple of minutes if that. Sadly billing this as a fantasy film is slightly misleading there is more set in the real world as Vidal and his soldiers try and flush the rebels out of the surrounding woods. All the elements are in place, a passionate visionary director, a story with some truth to it, top notch CGI, great actors, amazing score etc but it always feels that something is missing. I'm sure that the film is packed full of metaphors that when in Ofelia's mind relate to the real world but after sometime I stopped looking for them and started looking for what made all the critics salivate, I haven't seen so much praise heaped on a film for ages but unfortunately for me I couldn't quite see why it deserved so much. Pan's isn't a bad film just, unlike myself, go in without any preconceptions and you will probably enjoy it a hell of a lot more.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

An Unforgettable View on a Very Twisted World During a Very Twisted Time,"Guillermo del Toro's Academy Award winning 'Pan's Labyrinth' is a fantasy film released in 2006, about a young girl called Ofelia, who's going with her pregnant mother to meet her new stepdad in Falangist Spain during 1944, who's a sadistic army officer. Ones she's there, she finds an old labyrinth, where she discovers that she's a princess of the underworld, and must complete three tasks to return back.Not only is this film one of the most dramatic, well-thought out and brilliantly scripted films out there, but is it one that I would like to call a masterpiece and one of the greatest films of our time, maybe even of all.Because of the intriguing plot, del Toro was able to create a very unique vision that gives the film personality and a great sense of wonder. From the production-design to the costumes, make-up and effects, it was an absolute marvel to sit through. And the cinematography tops it all of with giving it an interesting mix of both dark-blue and orange colors, passing off the comforting and disturbing tone of the world.The score by Javier Navarrete is this fantastic magical summary of how powerful music can be for a motion-picture and how much it adds to it. I can definitely call it one of the greatest ones out there.The directing by del Toro couldn't be any better, as he captures the best shots and scenes that the movie has to offer, making it even better with his compelling script. The characters are all believable and very important, making us care for most of them and makes us invested in this strange universe where they are set in.With all of these elements mixed together, you get an instant classic, that will be remained as one of the most inspiring and heart-stabbing fantasy films/experiences that you will ever see, included with one of the most tragic, saddest and unforgettable endings that you will ever witness, which never gets old or worse and one of the reasons why it's one of my favorite films of all time.I'm giving 'Pan's Labyrinth' a 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

It turned out to be a real and serious anti-war film,"Before watching I thought it was an entertaining fantasy film (you would think so if you search on Google Images for the title), but it turned out that fantasy is only 30% and it is essentially a real and serious anti-war film.The location is in a deep forest. Even though it has become an outpost for the soldiers to hunt the guerrilla rebels, it is still a place you can imagine that some spirits are living there. Ofelia and her pregnant mother arrive there to meet her stepfather Captain Vidal, who is the character who represents the madness of war. Under the atmosphere of anxiety and oppression, Ofelia starts to see mystical creatures.Invited by a fairy, she walks into the center of the ancient stone labyrinth and meets The Faun. It is kind of funny that she shows no fear of him from the beginning. Maybe it is because he is quite humorous, at least compared with the cruel reality. He tells her that she is the princess of the underground kingdom, and to return there she has to go through three tasks.As a fantasy film, the best creation of it would be the Pale Man. He is sitting still and naked at the medieval banquet table, with a face with two holes that you can't tell whether they are eye sockets or nostrils. He is scary and creepy, but still somewhat humorous.Secret supporters of the rebels in the outpost are under the threat to be found out, including Mercedes who Ofelia has befriended. The violence of war deprives innocent people of their tiny happiness. In the ruthless situation, it seems that the Labyrinth becomes Ofelia's psychological refuge. A sad thought I cannot shake off is that everything might be just a figment of her imagination. Because from ancient times, fantasies have been created as consolation for the oppressed people.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

A Magical Journey,"Pan's Labyrinth (2006), a drama and suspense packed Spanish film directed by Guillermo del Toro that had my eyes glued to the screen throughout the unfolding of the two storylines that take place. Initially this idea may seem to be a concerning as it could cause the film to lose a sense of depth, but reassured the film is full of substance as it seamlessly transitions between war and fairytale till the very end when it all fits together quite nicely. The story follows Ofelia, a 12 year old girl as she begins her new life under her new stepfather the brutal and intense Captain Vidal, who never seemed fond of Ofelia to begin with. Ofelia sets up upon a magical journey where her goal is to complete 3 difficult at times tasks, and Captain Vidal is going to great lengths to maintain his regime and eradicate the Republicans. Guillermo del Toro's film works because he allows us to build an emotional bond with his characters through a fantastic premise. The film possess a good mix of pain and joy, and just the right amount of light humor, such as the working women interacting in the kitchen.When looking at the editing of the film, my biggest take way was the different colored camera filters used throughout the film, which worked perfectly. Using blue filters during more sad scenes helped us sympathize with characters, while yellow filters put a smile on our faces as they portrayed hope.This film is an absolute must see, a true masterpiece to say the least. The film is just really well organized, as Guillermo del Toro magically takes two very different stories and almost seems to tell them at the same time without missing a beat as they constantly build off each other, until they become one. Overall, in my opinion the amazing balance of bitter sweet moments really made this one of kind, ten out of ten hands down.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

Am I Missing Something Here?,"Given the present sorry state of American cinema, I was somewhat cynical of a film as heralded as this one. After all, what had Guillermo del Toro done to enhance his reputation as a filmmaker other than Blade II, and Hellboy? I've seen better resumes from young directors. So, what do we get from him in Pan's Labrynth? A magical war movie set during the revolt against Spain's Generalisimo Franco. Guys, I'm still waiting for the day when CGI becomes so good that it can replace the need for a good story. That del Toro is a product of the CGI-dominated school of film-making is very evident here, as the truly wondrous special effects taking place below the earth seemingly have little to do with the world above. There, the evil Captain brutalizes, tortures and kills peasants by the dozens, and we get to watch every excruciating minute of it. I even wanted to cheer when he finally ""got"" his in the end; one shot to the head. And, how does the magical world below help bring about the demise of the captain? Oh, it doesn't. This fantastic world of visual horrors but mostly delights, is strictly for the benefit of poor little Ofelia (and, surprise, surprise, there's her mother, another victim of the captain). The inhabitants of this netherworld enable us to appreciate the value of old time effects such as make-up, but it's still effects, effects, effects. Except for topside, where its murder, torture, more murder (we even get to see the captain perform a little stitch job on the side of his mouth). The more I write, the worse this movie gets, so I'll end it here by saying if you want to see a filmmaker combine plot with imaginative special effects feast your eyes on a Terry Gilliam film, particularly his Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas. If only he could reign it in just a little.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

Pan's Labyrinth exquisitely navigates a ruined maze of dark fantasies to escape a sorrowful grim reality.,"Francoist Spain, 1944. Five years after the Spanish Civil War, a dictatorship controls the meandering roads and bustling cities. The political authoritarian ideology of unifying Spain and eliminating regional separatism. An emergent battle between Falangism and the republican resistance formed. Innocent individuals punished with ration cards and intense scrutiny. Only enforcers of the totalitarian principles garnered true freedom. Captain Vidal, the son of a famed commander, treated like royalty. A king. His new wife, inflicted with the pain of a brutal pregnancy, ordered to join him at a rural command post. Her daughter, ten year-old Ofelia, reluctantly obeying her mother's wish. To treat the captain as a father.War ravages on. The Falangists luring the rebellious Spanish Marquis to the very abode Ofelia and Carmen rest at. The young, imaginative Ofelia is not alone during these times of turmoil. A pointed stick insect, believed to be a mystical fairy, leads Ofelia to an adjacent stone labyrinth where its walls echo tainted history for the trials soon to arrive. Once successfully navigated, an imposing faun greets the naive child, persuading her that she is the reincarnation of an ancient princess whose father is the king of the underworld. She must successfully complete three trials in order to acquire immortality and be resurrected in her kingdom. And thus beings a fantastical quest of escape. A desperate flee from the grotesque reality Ofelia currently copes with.Del Toro's legendary dark fantasy drama is a seamless blend of compelling war tirades and endless imagination. Both encompassing the thematic portrayal of disobedience and choice, two pivotal convictions that commenced the feud with the dictatorship originally. Ofelia often disregards her adolescence to allow her mind to distract from the nihilistic virtues of Vidal. Disobeying the captain himself, her mother and the faun. Challenging the orders given to her, in reality Ofelia symbolises the Spanish Maquis. Her fantastical tasks that she endeavours to complete however, perpetuate the greed and oppression of the captain. Retrieving a key from the belly of filthy giant toad, who prevents an ornate tree from flourishing. Retrieve a dagger from the lair of the terrifying child-eating monster, where she is instructed not to consume any of the food items presented. These dream scenarios immortalise the oppressive consequences of fascism, integrated seamlessly in an already melancholic reality.Del Toro, whom hints at various mythologies, crafts a fantasy that relishes in its darkened style. Whilst being inspired by Carroll's 'Alice in Wonderland', a young girl who seeks to escape her reality, the Mexican director wholesomely places his own spin on the tale. The trials are just as nightmarish as the reality Ofelia imagines herself out of, supplying the harrowing idea that reality is inescapable. She's constantly reminded to ""stop reading fairy tales"", to ""grow up"" and to ""stop believing in fairies"". Removing her child-like qualities indefinitely. All that remains is loss, grief and destruction. Bolstered by a screenplay that explores the painful bonds of a broken family during a time of distress, Del Toro inserts a sense of hopelessness throughout. Innocence is extinguished. Happiness devoured by the jaws of retribution. The important yet depressing conclusion surmising the preceding journey exquisitely, as poetic as the lullaby strung throughout Ofelia's arduous quest, composed hypnotically by Navarrete as he heightens the allurement of dreamlike qualities.The fairy tale of Princess Moanna brought to life through expertly crafted production design and creature aesthetics, utilising minimal visual effects in the process. Jones, dual-casted as the faun and Pale Man, enduring extensive costume and makeup applications to materialise two cinematic icons in the fantasy genre. Exceptional work from all departments. Baquero's vulnerable performance as Ofelia simultaneously conjures an infliction of sadness, fear and joy in an incredibly nuanced multi-faceted character. López as the antagonistic Vidal brings life to one of cinema's most degenerative characters ever. Ruthless and remorseless. He himself endures some succinct makeup and visual effects when relentlessly slaughtering the rebels he captures. Navarro's cinematography, frequently accompanied with a pale blue tint, enhances the illusory nature of Pan's Labyrinth with the bright, golden shades of the underworld juxtaposing the cold shades of reality. In theory, the two colour schemes should be reversed, yet it cements Del Toro's vision that Francoist Spain was even more hellish than the underworld itself.Without discussing the pivotal role of Mercedes or Doctor Ferreiro's heroic deed, Pan's Labyrinth has substantial depth to its visual narrative. Producing a surreal, ethereal and phantasmagorical tale of a country's ""unity"" relinquished by oppression, reducing a nationwide battle into a whimsical fairy tale. The grim realities of warfare paralleling the descent into an idyllic underworld. Pan's Labyrinth is Guillermo del Toro's magnum opus. A poem that surrounds itself in visual perfection and imaginary wonderment. And with that said, Pan's Labyrinth undoubtedly claims an elusive perfect rating. A labyrinthine parable that succinctly cements itself as timeless.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

Flashes In The Pan,"It's one of those continental movies that are so full of 'imagery' and 'symbolism' and 'metaphor'. Mostly, you either like them or you don't.The special effects within the labyrinth itself are really quite excellent. The civil war scenes in the contemporaneous real world are also no less graphic in their display of violence and suffering.The whole movie has a surreal feel in a way that perhaps wasn't intended. It's like an amalgam of 'Schindler's List' and 'Jurassic Park', but with the director blown out on LSD. If anything, it seems to have an identity crisis. The lead player who moves between the real world and the labyrinth is a child. That would suggest a juvenile target audience. But the graphic brutality depicted in certain military scenes, not to mention some of the creatures in the labyrinth would hardly be suitable for young viewers. Just because it's arty doesn't mean its fit for kids.For the most part I found the story formulaic and largely predictable. The ending was particularly twee, with the blood dripping down from the child's hand into the underworld fountain. Very prosaic, and so 'symbolic' of maudlin Spanish sentimentality.This movie does at least prove that Iberian cinema is catching up with the English-speaking world.

Beautifully directed movie,"Guillermo del Toro has recreated a historical time period with a fantastic story. The movie begins with the humming of a gloomy tune, which helps to set the mood and scene for the rest of the film. After this but still towards the beginning, the orchestra allowed for the magical atmosphere when Ofelia is introduced to certain mystical elements, such as the fairy disguised as a stick bug. The music in the remainder of the film was, for the most part, dark and dramatic. Using this type of music created suspense and made the creatures even more frightening. It also builds up and matches the twisted character of Captain Vidal, who is responsible for many horrific actions. Finally, the lullaby from the film shared a familiar tone and melody to those that are often hummed by grandmothers and mothers to their children.
The camera movements primarily function as a guide for the audience's attention. It leads them to become aware of certain elements that could have gone unnoticed otherwise. The way that the camera zooms in to objects helps viewer's notice minor details that later become significant to the plot of the story. It also contributes to the dramatic mood of certain scenes, such as when the stick bug flies into view from the statue's mouth. The camera movements aligned the viewer's perspective with that of the character, such as when Ofelia looks at the eye from the statue.
The costume and make-up of the film help illustrate the setting for the time period. It also distinguishes the various roles of characters, such as Vidal, the fascist captain and antagonist. His routine of shining his boots and regularly shaving his face shows his obsessive and controlling nature. Vidal and his men wear clean, blue-grey uniforms, which reinforce the coldness and social superiority of those characters. Ofelia's clothing primarily consists of greenish hues, which give the impression that she is down-to-earth, and modest styles that are appropriate for her age. The green also appears to embrace her in the same way she surrounds herself with nature.
The creatures have distinct characteristics. For example, the Pale Man is very tall and has sagging skin, with eyes on its hands. This horrific image is appropriate for the mood of the movie. The faun, on the other hand, is a round character who has the ability to display gentleness and wrath. His physical form is very texturized and contains elements of ""the mountain, the forest, and the earth,"" making him appear more ancient or wise. The costumes and makeup have significant impacts on the presentation of each scene.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

2nd time watching it after 11 years - Even Better!,"I remember my interest in seeing this when it first came out in 2006, so I went to the big screen and saw it there and remember being blown away about how amazing this movie was. I was a bit skeptical paying for a movie that wasn't in English, and having to spend the entire time reading to understand what was happening, and while it does take away from the experience somewhat, the movie is so compelling and gripping that it does little to distract you from the incredible experience. Something triggered in my brain 11 years later that made me want to see this movie again, and I just finished watching it and now that I'm older, found that I appreciated the movie even more this time around. The mixture of fantasy, magic, war, innocence, hatred, love, and the underlying good vs. evil story really are well balanced in this film. I'd have rated it a 10, other than what I mentioned earlier about having to read the subtitles which does slightly detract from the enjoyment. I read in the trivia notes that the writer/director declined a budget of 2x to make the movie in English, so I commend him for making such an amazing film and staying true to his desire to keep it original.

I have never seen a similar movie,"I have never seen a similar movie ... half is a dark fairy tale with hope, half is a real but desperate life.

Moving and powerful,"del Toro interweaves the mundane and the magical in this account of a girl whose mother has married and been impregnated by a Fascist army captain during the Spanish civil war. The Captain has decided that the progeny will be a son, and that the son should be with the father. Therefore the heavily pregnant mother, with the daughter in tow, is carted into an army camp in the middle of the countryside deep within guerrilla territory. This gives the backdrop to the film, not only in terms of locale, but also the character played by Sergi López, whose portrayal of a cold blooded man with an appetite for gratuitous brutality is positively chilling.In this situation, the girl, Ofelia, becomes drawn into a parallel world, totally alien to the various domestic and military issues which envelop the camp, but which nevertheless has an impact on those close to her. As events spiral seemingly out of control in both arenas, Ofelia is faced with intractable choices in which principles in one world or the other will be compromised.While the inventiveness and poetry of the mystical aspect positively transports the viewer into a magical dimension, it has to be said that the 'normal' aspect is as harsh as can be and provides an uncomfortable juxtaposition, a bit like offsetting the Chronicles of Narnia against Apocalypse Now.At its core this film is about sacrifice. It's about just how much people will endure, what they will go through, what dangers they will face, in whatever world, to stand by their principles and those they love.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
more cruel than enjoyable,"Went to this movie because IMDb had rated it 8.5. What are you people thinking? This movie is cruel and dull. I kept wanting it to end, and cared for none of the characters, from the viciously cruel captain to the incredibly stupid princess. If you want to see a good movie this year, go see Babel or The Queen. Something that actually makes sense. Or put in your Lord of the Rings trilogy and watch some excellent high fantasy. Something that actually has a plot and interesting characters. This also is not a movie you should take your kids to see. There are some incredibly brutal scenes.

Makeup,The sfx makeup is my favorite part of the movie. It is so beautiful! The mechanics they use for some of the characters are truly magical. The makeup in this movie really brings it all together. Though some parts are animated the makeup really stands out and it is quite amazing. The movie is also great! The story line is one that will keep your eyes drawn to your TV screen. So what are you waiting for? Go watch the movie now! And don't forget to pay attention the beauty the makeup brings to the movie. Pan is a character I would keep my eye on because of the sfx makeup and mechanics.

If I talk too much I'll end up spoiling it. The thing is to watch too.,"It makes a lot of sense when it gets close to the end.I watched it at the cinema when it was released here in Brazil in 2006. I couldn't take my eyes off the huge screen when I noticed the contrast there hand in hand: the violence of a war and the innocence of a child.Translated to Brazil as ""The Labyrinth of the Faun"", the film brings the reality of the Spanish civil war and the fantasy of the dreamy girl Ofélia, of which she is the only one to see a real faun.Scenes of strong violence and torture interspersed with scenes of children's fantasy and colorful fairies... The film goes from one extreme to the other, not being recommended to ""acute frets"".In addition to other strange creatures, the faun represented here does not look like the commonly represented fauns (as it also appears in the Fantasia drawing), it is a mixture of a goat (normal faun) and a tree, without much human resemblance (which raises proposed fantasy).Directed by the same director of El Espinazo del Diablo, this is certainly Guilhermo del Toro's best work in life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
If Fairy Tales were true,"A most interesting film, somewhat blending horror and fantasy together to make a unique story set during appalling times.

The Most Disturbing Fairy Tale I've Ever Seen,"This is the first film I've seen from dark fantasy film director Guillermo del Toro, and I don't think I've seen a movie that changed my perception of fantasy films as much as this. I am not kidding when I say that this movie is disturbing beyond reason, as it centers around a girl named Ofelia who moves in with her stepfather, the tyrannical Captain Vidal, while also living in her own imagination. Once she's at the residence of her stepfather, Ofelia discovers a mysterious labyrinth and meets a fan who sets her on a path to save herself as well as her severely ill mother. As time goes on though, there is a blur in the lines between fantasy and reality, and Ofelia soon encounters a horrific battle between Good and Evil.Right off the bat, the world building of the fantasy elements this film offers is incredible. The film has a very gritty and dark setting in the real world given the civil war happening, and as such the world Ofelia imagines is so grim yet imaginative that you wanna see more of it. The creatures in design are beyond words, whether it be the creature Pan (performed extraordinarily well by Doug Jones), to the fairies, to even a Pale Man, and considering that the film mixes animatronics and CGI along with makeup and costumes really brings the effects to new heights. It's no wonder the film won the Oscar for Best Makeup and Best Production Design, because this is like no other world I've ever seen in a fantasy film.As for the content, I did think that the arch of Captain Vidal got in the way of Ofelia's story a lot, and because of this it almost feels like two different movies are contrasting each other. However, it all fits with the dark world that Ofelia would go into, and since it's hard for her to witness such heinous acts in the real world, her imagination seems to take note and it creates a beautiful Gothic nightmare within itself. I could never stop rooting for Ofelia to just get away from such a horrid man or even life, and even though the trials she gets into in her own world are fake, the film succeeds in creating suspense between her relation with her mother and stepfather and what she can do to save herself.To quote film critic Jim Emerson, Pan's Labyrinth is ""a fairy tale of such potency and awesome beauty that it reconnects the adult imagination to the primal thrill and horror of the stories that held us spellbound as children"" As fantasy oriented as they are, fairy tales have never shied away from letting out their inner horrors, and those horrors have shaped kids into adults for the better. Pan's Labyrinth brings fantasy into such a grim underworld for a little girl's imagination that it fits beautifully with the contrast of reality and fantasy that can bring adults into this spellbinding fable. If you watch this film, you may never look at fantasy the same way again, but it will bring you back to a time when you cherished imaginary worlds as much as the next child.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
"A dark and deep fantasy film,visible only to those who know where to look.","Pan's labyrinth is surely one of the best fantasy films of time because it is a fantasy film full symbolisms and life lessons about pain,love and mostly about humans and their behavior.The movie has an eye-catching plot,combining fantastic elements with war and a lot of drama,some well developed and enjoyable characters like Pan,great music and of course a satisfying ending that makes the film far far greater,showing that we should sacrifice for our love ones and generally for others and our sacrifice will make us happier.This magical movie also shows the cruelty of human beings and shows that war makes people miserable and does not allow them to dream and hope.Pan's Labyrinth has a really dark tone as a film,which makes the movie more interesting and fascinating.It isn't like other fantasy films that show only the good side of life,but gives emphasis to the dark times that people phased during that times.The ending is so good because its tragic and happy at the same time!The director created a labyrinth that none of us would want to leave.A dark,deep and surely a film that is hard to forget.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
"It's a War Movie, not so much a Fairy Tale.","Most of the blame for being mislead should fall on the poster ""key art"" designers and trailer editors. It's marketed as a ""Grown Up Fairy Tale"" but it's mostly a war movie - OK POST-war movie about fascists, guerrillas, the horrors of war and such.It's not so much a mystical fantasy tale. I'd say that takes up about 12 minutes of the whole movie, which is really unsatisfying if that's what you've come to see.For what it is though, it's a decent movie. Over the top violent but that seems to be the whole point of a girl trying to escape it all.There were a couple ""WHY DID (or DIDN'T) YOU DO THAT!?"" moments while watching. Those are frustrating to me but I think most people can get past them as I came up with a couple justifications.So, don't go looking for a fantastical, magical tale.

"Brilliant idea, painful delivery system","I was touched by this movie when I first saw it in 2008. In many ways I was younger back then. I thought to myself tonight - ""I'm up for some fantasia fun with the Faun and Ofelia et al"". What I got instead was a rather landlocked affair, and the fairy tale I wanted just wasn't there in enough strength.The fairy tale concept in this movie is truly inspired, the girl feeling displaced in a troubled world and poor personal circumstances, stands to become a princess, if she can just pass the tests. The historical backdrop and the art house feel are perfect for this and the fairy tale is very compelling, it really manages to pack the required dark severity. The scene in the pale mans cavern with the banquet is truly masterful. Points also must be given for the ending, it did manage to make me feel at least some of what it promised I could. Thanks gang!But from there on it fails...Usually with these kinds of stories, the dangers are overcome by the heroine's exhibiting moral qualities that are the real message of the movie. In Pans Labyrinth, the real message of the movie is instead a gruelling lecture about fascism thrust upon us in the real world, quite apart from Ofelia's quest (are we wrong to question Del Toro's casting the communists as sainted warriors?). Just about all of the characters apart from those involved in the fairy tale are pretty loathsome, say nothing of ""the Captain"" who is one of the most unbelievable villains you will ever see. He really is boring, and he's in it all the way. It's not an exaggeration to say that the movie is about this sad irredeemable bastard. Even our heroine has no effect on him, in every scene Del Toro is saying ""don't you hate him? hate him now! he's a baddie!'Baquero, the Faun and the fairy tale save this movie from being a disaster. My only criticism of Baquero's role is that (I read this as a rumor, and it seems to fit) the role seemed to be suited for a younger girl, I sensed the script wasn't quite complex enough for her age. She would have landed the material had she been given it, she played her part very well. I absolutely love the way she is visibly tempted by the feast and waives the fairies off in the underground cavern to make her fated mistake.So over all, it was in Del Toro's grasp to make a truly great dark fairy tale, with an ending so good you are transported to another world, but I can't really say that's what this is. After his moment of genius, he can't stay on the path, and the result is a bit hard to take. He was like Ofelia in the cavern of the pale man - eats his own forbidden fruit for no reason (or for whatever reason), and we're all forced to wince it out.I give this 7 because the fairy tale really is quite intriguing, the rest was painful and predictable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
What exactly is the nightmare?,"""El Laberinto Del Fauno (Pan's Labyrinth)"" is a 2006 Spanish fantasy drama directed by Guillermo Del Toro starring Ivana Baquero and Sergi Lopez. After the recent watch of ""A Monster Calls"" I thought it was time to rewatch one of the film's most obvious influences. What makes this watch so special is the simple fact that I experienced it in the original Spanish version, of course with subtitles. Cause you know, I don't speak Spanish at all, but I wanted to see it as original as possible.
In the past, a trio of Mexican directors have established themselves in modern Hollywood and are jokingly known as the ""Mexican Trinity"" nowadays. Those directors are Alfonso Cuaron, Alejandro G. Innaritu and Guillermo Del Toro, all three are not only Academy Award winners, they also managed to make successful films in both English and their own mother language. In the case of Del Toro, his hugest success is this fantastic fantasy drama. As initially stated, I've already seen it roughly two years ago and it already amazed me back then. Now upon a rewatch, I see myself appreciating it even more. The director has put all blood, sweat and tears into this project and it's palpable in every single minute of runtime. He's created a nightmarish fairy tale that consists of countless small facets that make it so incredibly outstanding. What probably makes this film so legendary is simply how it looks. From start to finish it's absolutely picturesque and colorful, the visuals are nothing but stunning. On top of that, it doesn't only look incredible, it's at the same time ingeniously captured. DP Navarro did his best work in here and is one of the main reasons the film works out so well. But it's not only the superb style, it's also the story that makes it so uniquely precious. The Mexican mastermind has written and enacted a compelling and perfectly paced dark coming of age tale of a young girl during the Spanish war. In the course of this, he doesn't only manage to create realistic characters with complex personalities, he also succeeds to draw on a number of genres without letting it become a mess. What this film combines is nothing short of masterclass writing. On the core it's a packing history drama that elegantly weavers to together itself with fantasy and horror elements. Fairies and Fauns in a war drama? So strangely experimental. The Pale Man? Absolutely horrifying and iconic. As if that wasn't enough, the film even offers subtle social criticism with a juxtaposition of the war infected reality with the terrifying fantasy world, but it obviously comes to the conclusion that the reality is the true horror in this. While the CGI isn't quite the most outstanding (come on, it's no Hollywood blockbuster!), it still offers shockingly brutal make up effects that underline this statement. All in all, this film is hands down one of the most masterfully crafted feature films of all time. Not only does it have a breathtakingly beautiful story, it also has excellent acting performances a captivating plot and eerie visuals. It's a unique piece of art that combines countless aspects to sheer brilliance. Its overall tone end especially the ending might be sad, but it's never too depressing. The film effortlessly manages to hit you at the whole range of human emotions. Every director has a masterpiece and this is without a doubt Del Toro's magnum opus and probably one of the best Spanish films of all time. An absolutely beautiful dark fairy tale that anyone should have seen at least once.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

Excellent and Spellbinding Masterpiece,"'Pan's Labyrinth' is a creative, dreamlike, scary and utterly captivating Spanish/Mexican fantasy horror flick written, directed and co-produced by Guillermo Del Toro. Historical and grounded in its setting, but otherworldly and mystical in its storytelling that you can't help but fall into from the very start and it never lets up right up until its final moments. This is a stunningly gripping presentation packs a compelling narrative, incredible visuals and emotional depth into a complete package making this a dark fairytale masterpiece for the ages.The Plot = Set in 1944 Spain during the Spanish Civil War, a young girl named Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is sent to live with her cruel stepfather Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez). At night she meets a fairy who takes to an old faun Pan (Doug Jones) who tells her that she's a princess but must prove her loyalty by surviving three gruesome tasks.The movie effectively combines well-staged fantasy sequences with the gritty and downbeat real world Civil War elements thanks to its compelling script that balances everything perfectly as well as Del Toro's visual trademark flair which renders everything you see on screen so perfectly that it takes you a fantastical transcendent journey from start to finish. At it's core it's not really a horror film despite its disturbing imagery and scary undertones, it's more of a fairytale set in a nightmarish world filled which on the one hand features majestic creatures and then on the other its an all too serious examination of the horrors of the Civil War and that's what makes it so engaging and its something that sticks with you long after it's over.This manages to both terrifying and moving at the same time and that's a rare feat for any type of genre cinema and all that's down to the superb direction by Guillermo Del Toro whose created something really special and magical here and its definitely the best thing he's ever created. The special effects and monster designs are really something to behold here and are just magnificent and holds up incredibly well even by today's standards.The performances here are fantastic with each actor giving it their all in their roles and making this movie the spectacle that it is. Ivana Baquero gives an extremely effective performance as the young girl Ofelia. Sergio Lopez gives a compelling and well-rounded performance as the evil Captain Vidal and Doug Jones is utterly captivating as the Pale Man.Overall 'Pan's Labyrinth' is a unique masterpiece from start to finish and came as a breath of fresh air to the genre amongst all the remakes that cluttered the market at the time and brought new life into modern cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
A greatly executed fantasy and a decently executed drama.,"Pan Labyrinth, directed by Guillermo del Toro was a story set in Spain in the 1940's that displayed two story lines. The first one being a fascist group during the civil war located in the woods to keep out the rebels. The second one being an 11 year old girl by the name of Ofelia, who is trapped in her own fairytale land. Ofelia's mother, Carmen, is a widow who remarries Capitan Vidal, a murdering sadist. Alongside of the Capitan, a woman named Mercedes was his main maid, who proved to be a powerful, resilient woman behind closed doors. These three prominent female characters are what make the film complete the circle.
 Pan's Labyrinth is a film directed by Guillermo del Toro that takes place in the 1940's in Spain. This film is a drama, fantasy, war genre-based film that was published in 2006. This film is about an adventurous, young girl by the name of Ofelia that was sent with her pregnant mother to meet her new step-father, the captain of the Spanish army. During her stay, she comes upon a fairy who has essentially ""chosen"" her and leads her to a garden in the center of the labyrinth. She is acquainted with a faun who tells her that she is from royal descent and in order to reach her kingdom, she must complete 3 tasks. She spends her time throughout the film completing each terrifying task in order to reach the end of her destiny. Within this time, a ghastly chain of events takes place involving the captain, her mother and Mercedes. 
Pan's Labyrinth portrayed an effective fantasy by creating blue filters and bright yellow filters when she would travel off to her fairytale land. The fairies and detailed monsters create an artistic approach, leading the audience to be further intrigued into this fairytale land. However, the drama aspect of this film is not effective. There are some scenes that could have used further details to expand on the present moment. Also, a selected amount of scenes were quickly ran through and not enough time was placed on the drama taking place in that specific scene. The intended audience meant for this film is someone between the ages of 13-18. Although, this is a fairytale and fairy tales are usually meant for a younger audience, the monster-like characters in this film are way too scary for young children. There are also disturbing scenes in this film that involve: amputation, death and brutality that is not advisable for young children. An example of the effectiveness of a fantasy land, is when she goes to the garden to meet with the faun. Everything is detailed and has a mystical feel to the scenes. Compared to the lack of effectiveness on the drama scenes, for example when Mercedes was caught helping the rebels, it was a short-lived scene in my opinion. There could have been more emphasis placed, since this movie was revolved around the Spanish in the civil war. Maribel Verdu was remarkable in her performance. Everything she felt, I felt. On the other hand, ""Ofelia"", Ivana Baquero being one of the main actresses of the movie was an exceptional character. The pace of the film is enhanced with the editing and camera shots. They did a great job with close ups and focusing on weird details. 
 I rate this movie a 7.5 on a scale 1-10. Although, Pan's Labyrinth was a good movie, it was not the best movie I have ever seen. I would also be very careful about bringing your children with you depending on how old they are due to the little amount of graphic scenery in this film. Overall, it was an enjoyable film; however, I would not waste time on watching it again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Hype's Labyrinth,"Encouraged to watch this by the intriguing storyline and awards it won I finally got round to it wanting it to be as mesmerising as it was claimed. Well no, but it is a well crafted, fabulously photographed and darkly violent imaginative fantasy film. A previous post criticised it for not being fantasy enough - I got news for him: all films are fantasy because they depict worlds no-one knows and condense and order stories into contrived chunks for mass digestion. Why make fantasy realistic?Girl wants to and is given the opportunity to become a Princess in Fairyland partly out of childishness but also to escape the horrors of the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War. She has to complete three tasks successfully - something not quite achieved but! Like A Matter Of Life And Death and others, you are shown that this other world could be just an hallucination, even at the very end and even though you need it to be really true by then after all the brutality you've sat through. A brutal opinion of the audience indeed. There are three things shown to good advantage by this film: one is the sadism of the Captain and therefore the sadism of the movie makers in rubbing our noses in such fantasy bestiality, two is the eye-cutting digital cartoonery especially essential for the fantasy sections, and three with the present day message that Franco represented a dark time it actually succeeds into making you believe that the Republicans won the War instead of losing and instilling a ""positive"" note into the proceedings: another fantasy. If you need to see a truly wondrous fantasy film with subtitles watch Jean Cocteau's Belle Et La Bete instead.I enjoyed it to a point but hated the glorification of routine violence as a worthy artform even though I know that pandering to todays progressive and enlightened audiences could have made it much worse. Does it make us all better people to see a cheek being digitally knifed open or does it take us all down yet another notch? Because of all that not on my welcome back list, but it's interesting and thought-provoking stuff unless you're pretty sure that you can do without it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

Emotionally powerful and melancholic adult fairytale,"This film has a bit of everything : fantastical creatures, horror and tension, historical slice- of-life (dealing with the aftermath of the Spanish Civil war in 1944), a fairy-tale like story competing for screen time with a grim military attack against rebellious guerillas, loathsome and sadistic characters, but also cute and inherently good characters, warm and fuzzy sequences full of love and emotion, but also extremely brutal and disturbing violence. But most importantly, this film has a lot of heart, and by the end you will feel intimately connected with its principal characters, and it will make you cry with its stirring and somewhat ambiguous climax.This has been called an adult fairytale and there is a lot of ambiguity as to whether the magical and fantastical sequences are real or the imaginations of a scared and lonely child. There are clues towards both these possibilities, but I personally believe that thematically, it makes more sense that the fantasy sequences are just created by the mind of our child protagonist to cope with all the strangeness and brutality around her, and the ending really hits you even more powerfully with this assumption, as we grasp the true purpose of these imaginings and see how it helps her to achieve peace and happiness in a really grim situation.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
"Entertaining, but didn't quite live up to the hype","Entertaining and has lots of visual pop, but didn't quite live up to everything I had heard about it (this was my first time watching it, and I had always been interested). It's kind of a strange intersection, with the fairytale elements put alongside brutal violence and torture, but I think that was part of the point, the innocence lost in war and for Spain under the Franco regime. In the blend of fantasy and reality, I thought the fantasy elements worked better, and I wish there had been more of them. I loved the dreamy feeling of the child from the 'other world' and my favorite part was the Pale Man; the visuals are fantastic in that scene and I loved the Goya reference. The other half of the movie with the resistance fighters is decent, but not as strong as it could have been. It needed more nuance; the captain is cartoonishly evil and the plot is suspect at key points (e.g. a moment when it defies logic for someone not to kill him). I think the weak link here is unfortunately in the writing, as the story and characters are pretty simple.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
A very good film.,"The films darker topics (such as political violence, sadism and horror to some extent) were well balanced with fairy tale aspects, which gave it a more digestible and understandable way of exploring such heavy political topics. The cinematography, performances, makeup and visual effects were all so brilliant and helped ground the film as well as linking the fantasy to the harsh and brutal reality. The story itself was well written and very enticing as it did well to bring together both a very dark story with a very fantastical one, without it feeling too odd or one or the other feeling too out of place adjacent to one ever so different.

A Masterpiece one of my favorite films,I remember watching the 79th Academy Awards and although I didn't see the film i wanted it to win for whichever category it was nominated for. (I know kinda sounds dumb) Then one day when I was about 13 or so my parents rented it for me and I didn't quite understand what war was going on in the movie. Although the war part of the story was hard to understand and the violent scenes disturbed me and I still liked the movie and it is one of my favorites to this day!The film is about a young girl who finds out that she was a princess from a faun and must prove to be the actual princess by completing three tasks . Thats all I'm giving away because I don't want to spoil it and is really a great film to own on DVD.Also another thing to add is the musical score; it is truly Beautiful and one of my favorite musical scores to listen to.

"Detailed movie with an interesting story, but I didn't like it","It seems Cuaron didn't do enough with Harry Potter 3, some depressed Latino had to create a really sad and dark children's story. That's just me blowing off steam :)The story itself is interesting enough, if you count it involves a young girl that likes books, unfortunate enough to be the daughter of a woman who breeds children for a living (and not doing a very good job either) in Franco's Spain. If you consider that her newest ""father"" is a sadistic army captain, you've got the hallmarks of a cry-your-eyes-off drama.But then the magical world makes its appearance and all that civil war drama becomes slightly bearable while trying to understand what goes on in ""The Underground Kingdom"". Alas, this is dark and depressing, so the only things we see from this fantastic world are just creatures that look like annoying insects or like demons from US horror movies, with the eyes in their palms and such. Then just about everybody dies. And it wasn't even an Asian movie.It reminded me of a movie I once saw with a girl in a boarding house, always telling everybody that she is a princess (and getting hell for it) and that her father is going to save her. And finally her father did save her. The story was so similar that I thought this is a weird remake of it.Bottom line: the details were really great, the story interesting, the acting was superb, the atmosphere and soundtrack well done, but the pace was slow, the movie boring and the whole point of the film just passed me by.

"The emperor has no clothes, people--this film is UNWATCHABLE","This movie is the most over-hyped, underwhelming mess I have seen in some years. Incoherent and idiotic, it combines disgusting brutality with stupid writing and unconvincing acting, creating a torpid, bloated, overwrought dreary mess that is so unpleasant, so torturous and so dismal that it is akin to having a tooth extracted without nitrous oxide. I literally thought this was a joke for a while--how could millions of people be so in love with this mess--but apparently people are lemmings.The central character is SO APPALLINGLY EVIL--so mean, so insane, so brutal, such a DICK--that it just slams the film into the wall.

Haunting and magical,This is my favorite film of Guillermo Del Toro's. It captures a little seen era of history and injects it with (pardon the cliché) magical realism and a sense of wonder. All of the performances are great and the ambiance of this film instantly sets you ill at ease. It's like a twisted fairy tale and I hesitate to say too much more about it.,10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

A Darkly Woven Dream: The Enchantment of El Laberinto del Fauno,"El Laberinto del Fauno is a masterful fusion of fantasy and reality, a film that immerses you in a world as haunting as it is beautiful. Guillermo del Toro crafts a poignant tale where the magic of childhood imagination collides with the stark brutality of the real world, creating a story that feels both timeless and profoundly human.The film's visual splendor is unmatched, with its intricate creature designs and lush, atmospheric settings that transport you to a realm of wonder and unease. Del Toro's direction seamlessly intertwines the fantastical with the historical, crafting a narrative rich with symbolism and emotional depth.At its core, El Laberinto del Fauno is a story about resilience, courage, and the enduring power of hope in the face of darkness. It's a cinematic fairy tale for adults, as hauntingly beautiful as it is deeply moving-a true work of art that lingers in your heart long after the journey ends.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

One of the most perfectly beautiful movies I've ever seen,"Ofelia. She is Persephone, she is Joan, she is Iphigenia.Miyazaki's Chiro occupies the same space. I can think of no more affecting and effective renderings of the Archetypal Heroine. Actually, gender doesn't matter in this space. These are the greatest of heroes.Myth's are the dreams of a people; what I like to call Big Dreams. This film shines a bright light into places that exist deep inside all of us. It is a pure distillation of many of our greatest myths.We are in the hands of a great, great story teller here.There are elements of so very many giant stories; so many things that make me think of James Frasier, Joseph Campbell, and the Epics that I read many years ago. All of the great tales include, for instance, a scene or scenes in which the hero makes a descent into the under/other world: the world of the collective unconscious.'Nuff said.The mere sight of images like the one of Ofelia, dressed in red and gold, in the other-world, at the end of the film: they break my heart every time I see them. Over the course of the film, it becomes apparent that she IS the very character that most of us believe she's dreamt up. It's pure, absolute Magic!The colors, the themes of under/other world, father/monster; of the conquering power of Seeing...This movie is perfect.

Beautiful work of art,"Pan's Labyrinth is a beautiful film both dark and heavy in art, yet very real and far from being horror. It's essentially about a young girl who stumbles onto a fantasy world hidden in plain sight. She learns to see and interpret the signs and rules, all while living under the roof of an evil army officer. It deals with war, but on a small scale in an isolated environment, creating a perfect world where reality and fantasy blend together to the point that one loses track and lets themselves believe in the magic. The rural and dangerous setting also creates a sense of imprisonment, leaving the characters with an internal struggle about whether to flee or face their fears. One of Del Toro's best works, Pan's Labyrinth is masterfully executed with superb acting and phenomenal character design and will be remembered for a very long time.

Dark and adult,"First off this is on great looking film, on Blu-ray this looks magnificent, with a 16:9 aspect ratio it just looks superb, there's so much colour and depth to each frame, it's like you could reach out and touch it, there's never that flat digital look either you get with many modern films. This could be up there with some of the best looking films I've seen, The way the woods alone is shot with so much colour and light is wonderful, its like you can see and feel the beams of light, the pollen in the air. The film follows heavy themes of death, life, fascism, obedience and disobedience, as well as fantasy v reality. The casting, acting, camerawork and editing is fantastic. Rather than having monsters as a metaphor for humans or fascists in this the fascists literally are the monsters and the fantasy monsters are more imaginary than real perhaps. At night the creaky old house we find ourselves in seems to come to life with magic and noises. The plot involves a girl brought to a house in the woods by her mother, pregnant and unwell with her new stepfather, a captain in the Spanish army trying to defeat partisans in the area who he suspects locals may be aiding. The film's cinematography deserves huge praise, the way the camera moves and spins and glides through the locations in a way which might normally annoy me but absolutely works in this genera. The film has some very heavy violence, swearing, scenes of torture, it's not a film for children to be clear. The step father is a complete pig, there's no attempt really to soften his character, he's obsessed with simply ruthlessly destroying his enemies and making sure he has a son, everything is just a means to an end. That's not to say he's not an interesting or complicated character though, you spend a lot of time with him in the film and the acting is all round excellent, especially from such a young talent playing the lead. Scenes in the rain somehow look even more dazzling than in the sun, while the film has a very strong sense of fear and distress to it the ending felt slightly forced though with a few things happening I didn't quite believe even though our main antagonist describes pride as being his weakness, characters happen to be exactly where they are needed to be when it suits the story, otherwise though it's a really excellent film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Absolutely stunning. A must-watch film.,"After all the rave reviews I've seen, I'm glad I finally got around to watching this.Guillermo Del Toro is arguably one of the best filmmakers I've heard of. This film is genius and beautiful. It has a great balance of fantasy and reality/history. The acting, especially from the young protagonist, is incredible. Her character was so easy to care about and sympathize with. There's just something really captivating about this film.It might be a bit ambiguous and I think it's supposed to be; it blurs the lines between reality and imagination. It's enlightening and heartbreaking. I'd definitely recommend this movie. I've never seen anything like it and it definitely lives up to the hype.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
More than an anti-war movie!,"Masterpiece! This movie makes me feel heart-breaking so much!!! Ofelia's brief adventures are truly gripping and gritty. I have watched this movie several times, every time I cry when I see the ending. But more than that, this movie still has value at the present time.First of all, let's talk about the look of the movie. Wow, the makeup, the production design, that's the great thing about the movie, probably the most of the scenes are close-ups that are easy to make the viewer feel frustrated, but this is war so... And music, maybe that melody will follow me forever. Cinematography is too perfect.As for the content, I don't know of any story where the characters' developments are interwoven as compelling and complete as this movie. Amazing story telling. The characters are portrayed so vividly and realistically, the acting, perfect.But the important thing is the hidden value of the film. That's the message, which even now, nearly 20 years after the movie's release, still holds true. This is an anti-war movie. The anti-war value is shown very clearly and convincingly. The two pictures are opposites: a real world where people on both sides fight, some die, there's bloodshed, there's pain, there's lies, all sorts of bad things. And a cute, kind little girl with great love for her mother and baby brother. The two pictures blend together wonderfully. The editing of the film also deserves an Oscar.Going back to the previous opinion about the second message that I think the film wants to convey, this message is the important one, which is the desire to find the good things, the meaningful virtues of humanity. Kindness heart. Unselfish. Things are so luxurious and hard to find in our world today. Those beautiful values are increasingly mocked and lost. I am very sad about this. War is still as painful, still as fierce. Children are getting smarter and smarter, but how many children will the kindness of souls like Ofelia remain?I'm in pain right now!

Amongst the even flow of top 20 pop garbage and sequels to sequels of Michael Bay movies that weren't so hot the first time, there are few occasions when we rise over the disgrace, and conquer it.

A nice movie with great moments.,"I have probably seen this film a month ago, and even today, I couldn't believe that I've seen this movie, at the same day than the Oscars. And even to that, It was quite a coincidence that this picture was at the same time, nominated in the category for best foreign film. And the damn thing didn't won, every instant and frame of this movie deserved the Oscar for best foreign picture. Guillaurmo Del Toro deserve the little golden man, and was robbed of it.Oh well, if you don't have the money to buy the people, who gives out the Oscars, well you don't have much a statuette to begin with, in having it used as a door-stop. And when you got too much Oscars, well you got a decent coat rack, just right there; but I wouldn't think every actor in H'Wood would have competent welding skills.How can I begin, with this surrealistic and imaginary masterpiece ? It's treatment of the fantastic genre is not like what I've seen before in any picture, and it would be more scarce in Hollywood for that matter, even. Del Toro's masterful film, who is unrelated to Benicio Del Toro by the way, is an ode to Scandinavian and European mythology, in discussing Pan, and every monster contained. The settings are breathtakingly amazing, and what's better, the feeling of Spain is at most of a feeling of Fascist Italy, in the major setting of World War II. It is so much of a take on the fairy tale genre, that it delves into the human psyche. And mostly , it's this kind of fairy- taledness that blends in with horror and thus quite uniquely. Well not that much uniquely, you can also look at The Company of Wolves, by Neil Jordan, made in the 80's.You cannot find much of a hybrid genre that fairy-tale and horror, as well as Pan's Labyrinth. Terry Gilliam's The Brothers Grimm also works in the same flavor, which in the script mixes in the original authors of the children's books, into the horrors of their own creations. And it's also a perfect blend of horror and comedy, that comes with a keen sens of timing.The form and the aesthetic of this movie, is more than just simply gorgeous; it is keen, submersive, and aptly done, giving the sense that there was a Spanish Edgar Poe taking the helm of it. And you can really understand why, that the director of photography won the Oscar for Best Photography. The storytelling is simply very unique, which mixes the most abject of cruelty of man against man like a Dario Argento psycho-slasher flick, into the universe of make-believe. After seeing it, it may seem to you that it is very paradoxes, but that is part of the whole intention of Del Toro.In this paradox, he wants to give the sens of a psycho-slasher attacking the world of fairy-tale, quite explicitly as this one.When you come to think it ? What would happen if you made a movie that was a fairy tale, and it would've been made by Sam Peckinpah. You would probably think of an action film, mixing with the characters of D&D.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

En-gro-ssing Fare,"Yes that's right,the engrossment is not without hiccups.As a storybook,the movie is almost picture perfect and beautiful,even when there's blood on the screen;but as a story,the movie is a bit weak and falls flat at some stages.To tell you where exactly would be to rob you of the disappointment when you take a shot at it yourself.But it's not at all a complete waste of time,as Guillermo del Toro more than makes up for a slightly naive and ill thought out story with stunning visuals and a powerful support from his ensemble of actors.Maribel Verdú and Sergi López in particular lend an air of splendour to the overall proceedings,complementing the rich special effects with their strong,restrained performances.This in turn,helps the movie rise above the digital wizardry and artwork and gives it the human touch that makes it somewhat of a winner.At the end of it all,you might feel a tad let down by the story like i did,or you might not give a damn about it.Either way,you'd be glad you saw what Guillermo wanted you to see.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
The wheels on the bus go....,"I'm not much of a wardrama movie fan, but sometimes a genre film can raise itself through a good or original storyline and or sub story. Labirinto doesn't do this at all. It offers nothing more than a meandering tale about the evil of men (set in the easiest of environments to make it work, namely war), which's obvious message is brought far too straightforward and clunky to make any impact whatsoever. People that spout off this movie being a fairytale should consider watching the movie again with a timer. Perhaps only 7% of this movie deals with what can vaguely be described as a fairytale, although I would rather like to call it fable-imagery. We didn't call Kill Bill a Manga movie either just because it had some Manga scenes in it, now did we.Although it was beautifully shot and occasional featured some good acting, this movie was rather vapid and over the top in it's depiction of violence at the same time. At no point are you required to think because the movie overexposes everything it tries to touch. The characters are all, note all, two-dimensional which makes it impossible to relate to them. If this movie had been made in Hollywood in the same quality with an English-speaking cast, it wouldn't have survived 4 weeks at the theaters. It was just that year's foreign cinematic darling and the audiences slavishly and ignorantly followed suit.

Absolute Masterpiece,"It is a masterpiece that reveals the innocence of children, a source of joy that adds color to life in the cruel, dark and dirty world of adults. The film oscillates between a girl who takes refuge in the world of dreams as a defense mechanism and the brutal reality of the real world, war and people. It is the best thing one can do as a child. Good choice maybe, because it can be traumatic to have to see all the dirty truths when you don't have much responsibility.Throughout the movie, the idea that mystical creatures can help the girl is pleasant, but this movie is not a fantasy movie, it contains pure reality and drama. Let's give information about the content of the movie:
The Spanish Civil War has just ended and the government is still fighting against the guerrillas by setting up headquarters in some regions. Meanwhile, Offelia is a girl who lost her father and her mother married a cruel captain. In this war environment, people are dying and being killed, and there is no emotion in people.

And I god damn love it.After the initial introduction, we're very well aware of the world we're entering. It's a country tortured by civil war. So straight up, you're in a dark place.

The darkness of the mythical side is truly scary and with this combination of real and mythical fear, this dark undertone never leaves me and I was always on edge.The acting was superb even from young Ofelia.

"Disturbing yet beautiful, a true fairytale for adults.","It is a tribute to Del Toro that after all my anticipation, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" didn't disappoint. Let's just stand back and look at his filmography for a moment:Laberinto del Fauno, El (2006)... aka Pan's Labyrinth (USA)Hellboy (2004)Blade II (2002)Espinazo del diablo, El (2001)... aka The Devil's Backbone (Europe: English title) (USA)Mimic (1997)Cronos (1993)What jumps out for me is that it is his Spanish language films that consistently approach greatness. ""Mimic"", ""Blade 2"" and even the darling of many, ""Hellboy"", are poor at worst, mediocre at best. But look at ""Cronos"", ""The Devil's Backbone"" and now ""Pan's Labyrinth"". Each one is a politically aware, magical foray into strange and tortured worlds. I still marvel that it has taken a Mexican to create two of the most authentic explorations of the Spanish Civil War. Ken Loach's ""Land and Freedom"" was powerful, but more of an exploration of the failure of European Socialism than of the Spanish experience. ""The Devil's Backbone"" in contrast used fantasy to probe at the heart of the Spanish nightmare. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" continues this experiment and in the process becomes a portrait and indeed a celebration of the Spanish nation and its culture. Brutal and lyrical by turns, it uses its ""fairytale for adults"" label like a razor, exposing the real price of Spanish Fascism.At the heart of this movie we have a battle for Spain's future played against the backdrop of a rich and honorable past, one that is being sacrificed blindly. Of course, the innocents, as represented by Ofelia, are the chief victims of this madness. Motifs common to most of Del Toro's work appear again here; grotesque creatures, strange insects, violent men, put-upon orphans and an ever present Underworld of which we are largely ignorant. However, these elements are integral to the story and one comes away feeling that this is what Del Toro has been working towards all these years.A criticism that might be leveled at the film might be the black and white nature of the opponents, the Fascists being irredeemably evil while the rebels are honorable and good. However, it is a fairytale for adults after all and the allegory is rich enough to sustain this polarisation. Ofelia herself offers a complexity of character that is refreshing. Another charge one might level is the extremity of some of the violence and gore. To that I might point out that fairy tales have never been lacking in violence; I think it is in the Grimm Brothers' ""The Juniper-tree"" that a stepmother dismembers her son, cooks him up and serves him to be eaten by his father. Pleasant stories, fairy tales.Beautiful and disturbing, this is so far removed from Del Toro's Hollywood work as to beg the question why he works in America at all, though of course one can do nothing without money and he himself has professed to adopting the ""one for them, one for me"" rule. Thank God there is no way on earth the US could produce a remake of this.""Pan's Labyrinth"" stands alongside ""Spirit of the Beehive"" (another Spanish Civil War fairytale), ""Germany Year Zero"" and indeed Del Toro's own ""The Devil's Backbone"" as a superlative childhood vision of a world gone bad. Compare the success of this movie with the similar, but less impressive, ""Tideland"", and you will see that Del Toro is a true master of the macabre and a vocal poet of the childhood world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Inside Pan's Labyrinth,"""Pan's Labyrinth"" marks the second feature from outside the United States that I've seen within the last two days that I have proudly slapped ""10"" ratings upon. Without question, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is probably one of the most original movies I've seen since the start of the millennium, and I've seen a lot of movies.My positive response to ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" from Mexican director Guillermo del Toro (""Blade II,"" ""Hellboy"") probably comes from the fact that the fantasy genre, like horror and sci-fi, is not a genre that is usually up to par in the area of intelligence. But alas, one of the best visionary talents in the business ventures into a world that is entirely of his own creation and for once, he gets it right.del Toro made his mark on audiences in 1993 with the acclaimed vampire flick ""Cronos,"" a film I'll admit I have not seen but have heard much about, including the praise for the uniquely original vision of the director and its eight wins at the Ariel Awards in Mexico. He made his American feature-film debut with the horror film ""Mimic"" (1997), and then returned to Mexico with ""The Devil's Backbone"" (2001), which I have also not seen. del Toro has won over legions of comic book fans for his work on the aforementioned ""Blade II"" (2002), an adaptation of the Marvel Comics character and ""Hellboy"" (2004), which is an adaptation of the Dark Horse comic created by artist Mike Mignola. Now we're at ""Pan's Labyrinth.""A film with roots in well-known fairy tales such as ""Alice in Wonderland,"" ""Through the Looking Glass,"" ""The Chronicles of Narnia,"" Roman mythology but sources chiefly from del Toro's own twisted imagination, the Spanish-language ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is set in post-Civil War Spain in 1944 during World War II. The chaotic Civil War and WWII are only a backdrop for the meat of the story, which centers around 11-year old Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), who is driven with her widowed, very-pregnant mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) to the Spanish countryside where her husband, Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez), and his men have been ordered to eliminate the remaining pockets of the Republican Resistance.One night while sleeping, Ofelia meets a strange insect-like creature (which looks like a combination of a walking stick and praying mantis) that later morphs into a kind of fairy. It later introduces her to Pan (Doug Jones, an American talent in two roles under incredible amounts of makeup), who gives her three tasks to complete to ensure that her ""essence remains intact."" What this means, is that Pan recognizes Ofelia to be a long-lost princess, and these three tasks are a means for her to re-enter the kingdom where her father, the king, awaits.But these little tasks of Pan grow to be increasingly dangerous, as Ofelia is also hounded by the realities of her surroundings, including her ailing mother, the Resistance in the woods, and the sadistic Vidal's increasingly brutal methods of dealing with the Resistance. The only other person in her real world who really cares for her is Vidal's faithful servant Mercedes (Maribel Verdu).""Pan's Labyrinth,"" despite the fact it's a fairy tale, is certainly not a picture for children. Heed the ""R"" rating, parents, because you'll be shocked by some of what you see here. Its graphic violence (the most gruesome of which seems to be kept off-screen, for the most part) and disturbing fantasy imagery is what you have to beware of. Beyond that, this is one of the most starkly original fantasy pieces in a long time.When looking at a picture like this, especially a foreign-language picture, you'll have to cast aside any hesitant thoughts you may have, such as refusing to read subtitles. Really, I watch martial arts movies and Anime' and occasionally I have to deal with reading subtitles; it's not a big deal. It just ensures that you have to pay more attention to what's going on. With that said, I feel that the fact ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a Spanish-language feature only adds to its alien appeal, to remind us that we're watching something that is far removed from our reality. That's another plus on the part of del Toro.The actors are well-chosen (del Toro himself apparently hand-picked many of his principals). The bravest is the 12-year-old Ivana Baquero as young Ofelia. Bookish and seemingly unable (or unwilling) to grasp the harsh realities of the world around her, her escape into the world of Pan's Labyrinth seems almost expected of her by the more thoughtful members of the audience, given her circumstances. The aesthetic appeal of ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is what has surely gotten this film most of its greatest accolades around the world. From del Toro's own unlimited imagination, a whole new world springs to life almost effortlessly. His camera catches this fantasy universe perfectly, and his story is simply fantastic and otherworldly. As an aspiring author myself, this is what drew me in the most. Like Lewis Carroll or C.S. Lewis and their respective fantasy visions, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is all the more likely to join them as cherished classics.""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a dark, uniquely original experience from a great director, Guillermo del Toro. He is truly one of the most original talents working in the film industry today. I can only hope he keeps it up.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

"Enchanting, beautiful and cruel","Spain elected a socialist-leaning government after the departure of King Alfonso XIII, The Spanish Civil War began on 19 July 1936, when General Mola issued a proclamation of revolt against the elected socialist government.General Francisco Franco, known to hold right wing, monarchist views, began the conquest of Spain and in September 1936, other generals named him Chief of State. The war officially ended on 1 April 1939, but persecution of political opponents continued for years. An estimated 200,000 political prisoners probably died of starvation, overwork or execution. The Fascist regime ruled Spain until Franco died on 20 November 1975.El Laberinto del Fauno (Pan's Labyrinth) is a fascinating but surprisingly black fairy tale set in 1944, when Franco's army was energetically eradicating pockets of resistance to the Fascist government. A widowed mother and her daughter join the mother's second husband, an Army Captain, in his cold and austere post in northern Spain. The surrounding forest hides a cadre of resistance fighters and their encounters with the army are brutal and unsuitable for children.The mother's pregnancy is difficult, the surroundings are frigid and the Captain is cruel. The little girl escapes into a magic world in which she has a chance to save her mother and herself.

Astonished,"After having seen this last night, I must say I'm still surprised and astonished (in a good sense) about this movie. I truly like it.My expectations of this movie, before seeing it, was actually that I was going to see a fantasy/fairy tale movie, but found that only to be partly true, with the main plot actually being depiction of a very small fictional (i assume its fictional, but actually don't know) fraction of the war in Spain in 1944.The way he (Del Toro) blends the fairy tale plot with the historical drama plot is magnificent, and they supplement each other so well.After seeing this movie, I sit back with a feeling, that Del Toro wanted the two (maybe three) plot lines to be seen in different perspectives. The historical drama plot in an adults way, hence the sometimes very brutal visualization of the plot. The fairy tale plot in a child's way, hence the simplicity of the ""tasks"" our child is put through.

I went in with no preconceptions as I had never heard of it before and my husband bought the tickets because he had heard about it. I loved this movie. It had magic, violence, history, gore, family issues, war, and loyalty. It helped that the Spanish speakers spoke clearly and slowly so if I missed a caption I could still figure out what was going on. (My Spanish is pretty simple). The imagery and imagination of the fairy world were Oscar worthy. The fairies and faun were great special effects/costumes and the violent captain was very believable and scary as an out of control military man in a nasty civil war. The insurgents and local people are all believable and real and the magical world, with its beauty and dangers just draws the viewer in.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
One of the best fantasy films ever.,"Spain, 1944. It is the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War. In the Pyrenees, an arrogant Nationalist officer (Capt. Vidal, a frightening Sergi Lòpez), who has established his headquarters in a remote hamlet in the forest, is ruthlessly tracking down the last remnants of the Republican forces, who are hiding in the mountains. His pregnant wife and her daughter from her previous marriage arrive at the hamlet to live with him but are kept there in near-seclusion by the insensitive officer. The girl, Ofelia, escapes the cruelty of the Civil War and of her dour stepfather through an imaginary world filled with fairies. The entrance to her fantastical world is a stone labyrinth guarded by an ambiguous faun pretending to be her servant /hence the title of the film/. Throughout the film, Capt. Vidal reveals his penchant for criminal behaviour whilst we are left wondering whether Ofelia's fantastical world is imaginary or real. El Laberinto del Fauno's major success lies in intertwining the harsh, unglamorous reality of the Spanish Civil War with Ofelia's fantasies, even more so than in Peter Jackson's Heavenly Creatures. For me, this is really El Laberinto del Fauno's major breakthrough. Where, for instance, the Harry Potter or the Narnia stories could be set in any time, any location, El Laberinto del Fauno is inextricably linked with the terror wrought by Franco's fascist regime. Also, Ofelia's fate is much more traumatic than Harry Potter's or than Tolkien's Hobbits' because the most horrid monster of the film, in the end, is not the faun or the Pale Man, but Capt. Vidal. And, alas, it has been proved many times in history that the vilest monsters have always been human beings. Highly recommended (but not for children!).",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
"A marvelous, disturbing fairytale","Pan's Labyrinth is a very impressive film, both artistically and historically. It is fascinating to see how the worlds of fantasy and reality collide, and with what unforeseen consequences. Ofelia is an endearing character, very innocent and yet wise. She is perceptive; though she lives half the time in a world of fairies and fauns, she notices the destruction of the world around her. Though her story is compelling, and her imagination darkly fascinating, Ofelia alone did not make this movie great. Instead, what shocked and impressed me the most was the uninhibited way in which it portrayed Franco's Spain. This film is not shy when it comes to violence. If you are in the least bit squeamish when it comes to blood, this would not be a good choice! I found the violence overpowering at times, though it was not gratuitous. On the contrary, having it so present in the film forces the viewer to put themselves truly in the time period, and makes them consider the situation more in depth. It was not a happy time for Spain; death and killing were simply everywhere. The character of the sadistic Captain takes this to extremes, but it comes from all sides, and we can see the pervasive effects of this violence in young Ofelia's thoughts. The film also forced me to assess my personal character. Whenever a film is so deeply real, as this one is, that it brings the viewer into the world in which it is set, it makes me wonder: what side would I be on? In that same situation, what would I do? Am I brave enough to do what we know is right? Difficult questions to answer. For me, Pan's Labyrinth inspired such self reflection. It will blow you away, sicken you, inspire you, and leave you haunted. In all, an excellent dark fairytale that deserved every Academy Award it won.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
"Beautiful, visually stunning, and perfectly bittersweet","First, off before I tell you how much I've enjoyed this film, let me just state how much I hate people who bash this film because it's in subtitles. If you don't want to read the subtitles then learn the language!Back to the film...it was a magnificent feast for the eyes and ears. Everything about it was perfect, the score, the cinematography, the visuals, and the acting was all very well done. Most incredibly was the acting of young Ivana Baquero, when she told her little brother that she would make him a prince, I was near tears (Dakota Fanning is terrible compared to Ivana). And of course how can I forget about Sergi López's performance as the tyrannical Captain Vidal? The thing I found most intriguing and indeed the most terrifying about his character is that how is so prim, proper, and polite about everything, he almost seems human.The only weak part that I found in this film was the fantasy elements (or lack thereof), all the elements can be seen in the two minute thirty second trailer. It's not a lot, but still a wonderful film.Although, for some who have heard that the film is gruesome, it is. But so are fairy tales. I mean, read the original tales by the Brothers Grimm and Anderson, look back on what happens, grandmothers eaten by wolves! Witches eating children! And you know what happened to ""Jiminey Cricket"" in Carlo Collodi's Pinnochio? Killed by Pinnochio himself in the beginning! Mix that with Spanish Civil War and thats a lot of blood. And for the people who disliked that aspect of the film, let me tell you this. That's life. Life's gruesome, it's ugly, things don't go the way you want them, people die, tears are shed, but it's also this beautiful, amazing thing and I think Guillermo del Toro has captured those things in this film. There are just so many layers to this film, the only way to view them is to watch this wonderful film over and over.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Fantastic fantasy,"This Spanish-language film is an utterly brilliant interweaving of two different tales from two totally different genres: one a story of the last stages of the Spanish Civil War in 1944 involving much violence and cruelty and the other a Gothic children's fantasy with various fantastical characters. What links the two narratives is the central personage of a young and brave girl called Ofelia (12 year old Ivana Baquero), the step-daughter of the brutal Spanish army captain (Sergi López) in the first story and the reincarnation of a lost underworld princess in the second.This could so easily have been a ridiculous failure, but its stunning success is thanks to Mexican writer and director Guillermo del Toro who manages to make both tales both compelling and connected and, in the process, offers us some shocking characters - both human and fantasy - and many thought-provoking incidents and situations. He imbues the whole thing with washed-out colours and wonderful visual imagery. Del Toro has described the labyrinth as ""a metaphor for Spain in extreme right and left transition to where it is now"". This is most definitely not a film for children, but any adult who values innovative cinema will find this a rare treat.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
What an experience,What a marvellous experience watching this.Top notch direction and splendid performances from all involved.Just goes to show how you can have a fantasy/horror/war/thriller/growing up movie with a love story thrown in.I wish I could have seen it on the big screen and I think 3D would have made this a real feast. missed it at the theatre so watching on Blu ray with surround sound and it hasn't let me down.This is how to make movies. Bit of everything thrown in and wonderfully dark which switches from the innocence of a young girl straight to the horrors of war and then off to a fantasy world of talking wood and secret worlds.Brilliant.,7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Innocence: Weapon Against Sadistic Violence,"Many films portray characters' fight against war and violence. Characters use different ways to stand up against the terror and hopelessness that violence brings. For example, Guido battles the Nazi terror with his humour in ""Life is Beautiful."" Wladyslaw Szpilman fights the same regime with his determination to survive in ""The Pianist."" In ""El Laberinto del Fauno,"" Ofelia's weapon is innocence. She is so determined not to shed innocent blood for her own gain. She maintains her purity when she is put to the final test late in the film.The film is appropriately dark and violent (hence not for everyone). It depicts the violence, cruelty, and hopelessness of the human world. The underworld is always dark but it is where Ofelia finds her true identity and personality. Her journey, however, is not smooth. If Ofelia passes all three tasks without obstacle, this film becomes mundane. Her failure in the second task highlight that our lives are prone to temptation and doubts. Steps of faith are not always easy to take.Del Toro's ability to closely and smoothly weave the fantasy and reality world impress me. We tend to think that the two worlds are far apart and drastically different. ""El Laberinto del Fauno"", however, depicts violence both in the human and fantasy realms. In the human world, Captain Vidal and his Fascist troops try to weed out the rebels. In the fantasy world, monsters like toads and ogres wreak havoc to trees and children.Ofelia maintains her integrity and innocence till the end. However, I wonder what source of hope can other people find. Ofelia has a predestined identity that other people do not. Pedro, Mercedes, and others must find ways to secure peace and hope. Unfortunately, Del Toro does not discuss how their conquests unfold. Ofelia's journey is so private and unique that others cannot share. Such is the reason for the 8/10.The score draws me in. It gives me a sense of mystery that I am ready to journey with Ofelia, looking for the peace and hope that we long for. I listen to the entire soundtrack in the official site and it is amazing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Disgusting attempt at a movie,"Any movie that promotes senseless violence and makes a scene consisting of a young man having his face literally bashed in with a bottle in front of his father until he's dead for no reason other than to show senseless violence and disregarding human life is crap in my books.

A superb mature fantasy tale!,"If there's anything about Pan's Labyrinth that disappoints me, it is only that when the DVD comes out it'll be advertised as being made by the same guy who made Blade II and Hellboy, two examples of half-cooked SFX wankery coated with comic-book fanboy drool. Pan's Labyrinth is everything those films aren't: It has a story that actually interests, it has visual FX that are built entirely to tell its wondrous tale and don't look like generic ""sci-fi meets kung-fu"" tech demos and it's not afraid to make you feel depressed about cruel things that happen to characters you grow to like.Set in WW2 era Spain where the Fascist military is doing its best to suppress the rebellion, the film centers around Ofelia (a bravura performance by Ivana Baquero), an imaginative child who with her re-married and pregnant mother comes to stay with her step-father, the iron-handed Captain Vidal. Shying from the general air of militarism and brutality around her, Ofelia slips into a fantasy plane where she meets a faun who tells her that she must complete 3 tasks for her to reclaim her legacy as the princess of a magical realm. The plot travels between the real and fantasy worlds of Ofelia, and scenes of civic unrest and fascist oppression alternate with magical quests that involve giant frogs and creatures with (removable) eyes on their palms. Even the climax has 2 parts, one in the real world and one in the magic world.Under Del Toro's guidance the story moves seamlessly between the 2 worlds and he does not discount the existence of either of them. Some may pick nits about the somewhat one-sided characterization of the military as dedicated sadists but the thing to remember is that this is a film told essentially from a child's POV and reflects the simplicity of that perspective. Of course it is not to be taken as a film for children, because it does not flinch from graphic violence when needed and even the ending has a moving tragic air to it.In the end, this is a modern day classic that needs to be seen and savored by teenage/adult audiences that look for something beyond merchandise-oriented studio crap. And move over Tim Burton, there's a new prince to claim the mature fairy tale fantasy crown that you've been wearing so far. His name is Guillermo Del Toro and from the looks of it, he has kicked your ass by a long mile.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Thank God for Guillermo.,"Pan's Labyrinth by Guillermo Del Toro is the film we fantasy and horror fans have been salivating for. What an imaginative spectacle Del Toro has created here, a pure delight on every conceivable spectrum. A young girl, Ophelia, is sent to a mountain army station with her pregnant mother, in order for her sibling to born in the presence of the her stepfather, the Captain. The environment is hostile, but the sides are drawn clear early on in the film, and an even side story between guerrillas and their opposition give the film a realism that juxtaposes with the movie's terrific fairy tale premise. Shortly there after, Ophelia discovers a fairy and is soon led to a labyrinth on the army stations outskirts. Her arrival in the maze is something of prophecy, and once she delves deeper in, the best part of the movie begins. Great visuals and equal acting highlight the film from start to fin. And though a couple parts seem to be rushed for the sake of time, Del Toro directs effortlessly, mixing realism with fiction sublimely. A perfect score as well as a captivating story hold this film high above all others this year. 9.5 outta 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
A Goyaesque vision of Spain,"At the end of the 18th century, Spanish artist Goya produced an artistic masterpiece ""el sueño de la razon produce monstrous - the dream of reason creates monsters"". Del Toros' recent film is a modern version of the same theme. As in Goya's time when Spain was rocked by the Napoleonic invasion, the setting of Pan's Labyrinth during the time of Spain's civil war serves to remind the viewer that society is very fragile and subject to radical change through brute force. In the new Spain, where might makes right, innocence is lost, and people's lives are sacrificed in order to make way for a painful vision of Spain's fascist future, a girl creates an alternative fantasy world in order to cope with the trauma that is her life. Nevertheless the monsters of her dreams provide little escape from the brutes that she must deal with every day. Trust, power, loyalty, secrets, all are vividly represented by the actors in this, one of the best films of 2006.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
"A touching fairy tale, but not for the young audience","It turns out that the lascivious Greek half-goat deity plays only a minor role in this movie. The name, posters and trailers all underlined its fantasy part, but you'll mostly be disappointed if you expect something like the Lord of the rings trilogy. In fact, even with all these fantasy elements ripped off, it would still be a meaningful war drama.I'm not quite with the hype on this movie. I think an objective rating should be somewhere between 7 and 7.5, but definitely not the current 8.5 on IMDb. The good part is the vivid contrast between the cruel adult world and the fairy land which only exists for the innocent. The even better part is the ambiguous interpretations from various hints and charades masterfully intertwined together by the director. However the shortcoming comes directly from these same merits: the excessive violence and dark humanity make the fairy-tale elements seems superfluous for an adult watcher, while the allegorical cinematography is obviously too hard for the younger audience.There is some heavy debate going on about whether the fantasy world was real or the poor little girl just imagined it up. Real-fantasy supporters backed their theory up with otherwise-hard-to-explain details such as the restorative effect of the magical root, the escape of Ofelia from the guarded room to reach her brother, the oracular nature of the magic book, and the blossom as well as the narrator's lines at the final scene. On the other hand, day-dreaming theorists dismissed above claims as insubstantial, because if one can make up stuffs as large as a satyr's labyrinth, how difficult it could be to invent all these puny details?Such indeterminate nature leads me to think about another alternative. Namely, What if the fantasy is real, and the ""real world"" stuff is all from Ofelia's imagination? It's possible to put the whole story in a theory that Ofelia is indeed living in the fairy under-land, she imagined the life of mortals because she craved for it. The sole purpose she made up this detailed reality-tale is to impress herself.Well, I don't really meant to confuse things up, my point is that it is really hard to tell what is real or not from what you've been shown. Let me quote a reader's opinion on this issue: ""We can debate this until the fairies fly home, but in the end one of the beauties of this film is its ambiguity. Guillermo has his own ideas about the reality/fantasy thing, but he has left the film open to interpretation. His own personal view is that it was real ... but he lets you all make up your own minds.""Some final comments: Ivana Baquero is a true nymphet. With all the slenderness and feline beauty only found in girls just before adolescence, she is the crowned successor of the princesshood left vacant for more than a decade since Natalie Portman's unforgettable portrayal of Mathilda in Leon.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Where is the fiction in this tale of adult violence?,"When I got into the theater I was expecting a better movie than 'The Lord of the Rings' or 'Narnia'. Any director, at this point, must have learned about doing a technically good movie, that's a fact. What we, the audience want, is a good story. But after a while, I was sure of something: I was going to be disappointed. But I waited longer and longer, and the sensation didn't disappeared, only got stronger. Del Toro made a movie about a fabulous tale, but fail on the point of telling the story of Ofelia, a girl taken to the middle of the Civil War in Spain -that actually never concerns or interests her-, and confronted to an evil man who is meant to be his stepfather. She finds a labyrinth that nobody has explored even if is located near the soldiers camp, she goes down and finds out that she might be a princess, but has to go through three dangerous tasks. The faun, Pan, doesn't look believable and the story, itself, doesn't, either. Is she is the lost princess and the king has lived for centuries waiting for her, why does she has to confront dangers and prove it? The movie seems to be conceived as a horror movie, full of creepy sounds, with an evil man (Vidal) in the main character who becomes, at the end, in the only half-developed character in the movie (the mother, Ariadna Gil, appears like a ghost, an empty character), and has dozens, hundreds of unnecessary violence, shootings in the face, torture, blood and only more blood. What a way to waste a good tale and a good story. The girl, at the end, doesn't have but very short encounters with the fictional world. The real and violent adult world prevails.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Exceptional,"100% spoiler free comment....I won't delve into the plot of this film, if you watch it you'll soon find out what it's about.

I had been left speechless and in superpositive shock after watching this amazing piece of art. It's a waste of time saying that this is a visually perfect blend of Bunjuel style shots and Goya's black paintings, Gothic fairytale storytelling and revolutionary partizan movies, love and death, real and surreal....it's all been said already. Its pointless and of no matter at all for this film! The fact is that this is a uniform energy flow, piece of art that surpasses all separate arts that it's made of. It's an open road to the core of viewer's soul. In one word, truly a masterpiece! I just can't get one thing...?! How can this be made by a director that made films like Hellboy or Blade 2?!? What happened to him? The same question could be pointed to brothers Wachowski that made Matrix 2 and 3 after original Matrix.

A dark masterpiece,"The first time I watched this movie I was 11 years old. I came out of the movie theater terrified, yet amazed at the brilliance and beauty of the film. Since that day it has become one of my favorite movies of all time.Everything in this movie is carefully thought out and crafted. The cinematography is not only gorgeous, but it also sets the mood for the movie perfectly and reinforces its main themes. The performance given by Ivana Baquero as Ofelia is heart braking and should have earned an Academy Award nomination. The way Guillermo del Toro directed this young actress was perfect. Sergi Lopes as Vidal gave one of the most chilling and terrifying performances to date. The character's cruelty and lack of empathy are very well portrayed by this Spanish actor.Doug Jones as the faun gives an outstanding physical performance. Although another actor voices the faun, Doug Jones nails the physicality of the actor and creates the illusion that he is in fact speaking. Doug Jones's best performance in this film is as the Pale Man. Even with all the make up on, Doug grounds the character and makes him both terrifying and believable. The way it moves and walks is menacing and frightening. All the other members of the cast also have amazing performances that contribute to the brilliance of the film.Along with Guillermo Navarro, the cinematographer, Guillermo del Toro portrays a brutal and cold vision of the world and the fascist era in Spain. They show the brutality of the war and set the mood with the beautiful blue colors in the night scenes. This film is one of the most beautifully shot films I have ever seen.All in all, this is a beautiful film that portrays the world in a cold and brutal way, but never without losing hope.

A dissenting view,"By interweaving the brutal reality of fascist Spain with a child's fantasy world, the filmmakers evidently hoped to say something deep about evil. Undoubtedly the juxtaposition of the two worlds is done with considerable guile, both in the transitions and in the visual echoes between them. The problem is that the film begins with a portrayal of evil, in its realistic scenes, that is so trite that the fantasy sequences have nothing of substance to elaborate upon, and end up being merely sentimental. Del Toro appears to equate evil with mere sadism, taking computer-enhanced violence as a shortcut to presumed moral insight. The characters who populate the tale – the despicable captain, the heroic resistance fighters, the compassionate doctor – are the flimsiest of stock figures. This weekend I saw Louis Malle's Au Revoir les Enfants, where evil is a mysterious force that indelibly marks the rites of youth. That film attains a kind of terrible moral sobriety that is not to be found here. Watching the new film's all too consciously grandiloquent ending, I wasn't sure that it amounted to much more than Spielberg meets Tim Burton.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Brutal... magical... powerful,"When I went to rent this film the clerk was sure to advise me: ""You know this is Spanish with English subtitles, right?"" I told her I already knew that. ""Okay, just that I've had some people return it."" So there's my first piece of advice for watching this movie; yes, it's subtitled. You're going to have to actually read the dialogue.Second piece of advice: don't equate ""fantasy"" with ""suitable for children"" and ignore this film's R rating. It earns that rating honestly with some VERY graphic violence.Given those two caveats, PAN'S LABYRINTH is a spectacularly original, heartbreakingly beautiful movie. There's a temptation to veer into movie-geek talk about how it speaks ""to the human condition"" and how it ""demonstrates the triumph of imagination over pain"", but I'd rather comment on how it just makes a fantastic, entertaining story.This movie is just as much thriller as it is fantasy as it is tear-jerker. The power of PAN'S LABYRINTH is that its characters are at once familiar and well-drawn.The film occupies two worlds: a remote army encampment in Fascist 1944 Spain and the magical second-life of pre-teen Ofelia, the stepdaughter of the camp's captain. Neither of these worlds is presented with any compromise. The Captain (Sergi López) is clearly brutal and not-so-clearly insecure, constantly aware of the memory of his father, a General killed in battle.Ofelia's (Ivana Baquero) escape from her hated stepfather is a world of faeries and fauns, rendered seamlessly. This is as beautiful an application of digital effects as I've seen in any film. The creatures are original--at times terrifying--and constantly amazing.A word on the violence of this movie. It is absolutely necessary to the story, and the film's emotional power would have been diluted without it. I would not show this movie to my children, but as an adult I appreciate Del Toro's trust in his audience. PAN'S LABYRINTH is my new prime example of how graphic violence CAN serve a story.Yes, PAN'S LABYRINTH is brutally violent, and, yes, it is subtitled. Given those conditions, I recommend it highly.

I didn't regret! It's not really an ""enchanting story"", but one related to the cruel world where we live! That's what I found more deep and interesting in this film: its message!

The definitive adult fairy tale,"Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth is set in the immediate aftermath of the Spanish Civil War. And it's no ordinary film. It's a highly original combination of war drama with pure phantasmagorical fantasy. Its central character is a young girl called Ofelia, quite brilliantly played by Ivana Baquero in one of the all-time great child performances. Ofelia follows her mother to a remote outpost where she joins her new husband, a sadistic army captain. Ofelia is a shy bookish girl who loves fairy stories. Almost immediately she discovers a parallel reality, an underground labyrinth presided over by a huge faun. This strange world is contrasted with her grim reality, a joyless world full of violence and hopelessness. Both realities merge for Ofelia and the fantasy world provides answers for her to take back to her real life.This is perhaps the most definitive example of a fairy tale for adults. It's a story that combines great beauty with harsh ugliness. Its strong stuff that doesn't play things easy. It's emotionally pretty intense and will move most people who watch it more than most movies. The exceptionally talented cast of actors help cement the dramatic intensity. While, it benefits from the hand of a master visual storyteller like del Toro. Very few directors would have thought it obvious to tell this story in this way. But it's precisely this idea that elevates Pan's Labyrinth to such a high level. The serious drama benefits from the bizarre contrast provided by the fantasy and vice versa. They both bring out interesting aspects of each other and they both ultimately combine to devastating emotional effect by the end.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

For the majority, it is the sense that the villains are capable of such hateful and inhumane acts that you fear what they will do next.

Inside the Labyrinth she meets a Faun (Pan) who tells her that she is a princess and must complete 3 tasks to return to her underground palace. But there is something unsettling about the faun. Meanwhile her pregnant mother is very ill, and her stepfather is an evil war captain. The brilliant part about this movie is that there are two plots. The one plot is the fantasy one of the girl's imagination and the magical underworld and another ""Real World"" Plot is about an ongoing War. The reason that was brilliant was that even though there was much importance to what the girl is doing in the fantasy land the ""Real World"" still revolves all the sameA MUST SEE!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Cardboard,"I expected better from such a high rating. The problem with this movie is that all characters are cut right out of cardboard. The captain is an evil military genious, but most others are quite predictable. I am not sure what to think of the fantasy scenes. They are well done but I can't make much sense out of them.So this movie would have improved a lot if the backdrp made any sense.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
"Good, but not what you probably think it is","My impression has been that this film is being marketed as some girl's fanciful creation of a fantasy world into which she retreats during a time of upheaval. Technically, that's probably true. But not the way Americans might expect it to be.If you expect to be drawn into Willie Wonka's chocolate factory for 90 minutes, you will be very disappointed. I would hazard that perhaps only about 30 minutes is spent in any sort of alternate reality. And that reality, while generally visually appealing, is actually much darker than Wonka's, for the most part.Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed this film considerably. But it's not ""Chronicles of Narnia."" There are rather graphic acts of violence, and the escape the girl finds in her alternate reality isn't exactly as rosy as you might expect. Every time you think maybe you should turn away from the screen in anticipation of what is about to happen, turn away, because that's exactly what is about to happen.The positive notes are not as readily digestible as they generally are in American movies. You have to be willing to accept that you have to work a little to find them.Finally, I would recommend this movie, but don't go if you're expecting something light or fanciful.Take care.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Flawless!,"Dreams are the place where we can all escape from the evils of the world.This movie speaks from the heart. A beautiful fairy tale embedded in a moving story about a family struggling to survive in a world on the brink of chaos. The movie is based on the simple concept of the power of life and the power to take it. It has been a long time since I've seen such beauty and evil in the same film. It is a great throwback to the original intentions of the first Star Wars trilogy where good and evil were mutually exclusive with no shades of gray. The characters are multi-dimensional, well crafted, unpredictable, and draw you into the movie.I loved the bad guy! I haven't seen such a truly dark character in a very long time. He's cold, evil, and remorseless, and I found it hard to see any redeeming qualities about him. He is the true definition of a Heart of Darkness, consumed by hate and greed. Our heroine is the perfect counterpoint: frail, innocent, loving, and selfless.The historical part of the movie may throw some people off, but I suggest you sink yourself into it to figure out just why a fantasy aspect was such a brilliant idea. This is not your Neverending Story or broomstick movie. It is much more stripped down but magically crafted so that the fantasies seem almost plausible and the lines are blurred between the real and the dream.I loved this movie! It was a true epic tale.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
A balanced blend of the fantastic and disturbingly real,"I cried in this film. I wasn't sure if I was crying because of the cinematic experience, because of the climactic conclusion, because of how I connected with the fantastical world... but when the lights came up, I didn't want anyone looking at me. I just wanted to vanish, not be left in a house full of people. It's rare that a film captures me so deeply, that I'm able to actively watch it without a live critique going on in my head. This is a sample of film-making at it's finest. Using the language of cinema to say something more about a time and a place. Putting his best metaphors forward, the filmmaker harnesses the reason why imagination exists, and juxtaposes it brilliantly with a brutal war. I was astounded by this film. I expected more of the Labyrinth, and less of the war; but that's just a preconception based on advertising. Despite the lack of David Bowie, this film was the best I've seen all year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

"Simple, yet complicated","From the oppening, to the end, I found this movie to be engrossing. The cinematography for one was incredible, all from the lighting choices, the edditng and the way they cut from one scene to the next showed a lot of creativity and was done in such a way as I have not seen in anything close to the likes of in a film recently.If you are looking for just a pretty picture, of a story which is easy to understand, then this may not be the best choice for you to go and see. However, if you are looking to see and discover a whole new world (and when I state this I am not just talking about the magical world and it's elements in the film, I am also talking about the period in the Spanish civil war in which this film takes place), then this will be a film you will probably enjoy and which you'll probably buy a DVD of, that you will have around for the next 15 years.It's not a history piece, it's not about history and facts, nor is it a war movie, or even a children's' movie for that matter. It is a story about people. It is a story about people in difficult circumstances, going through hard times...never the less, the film goes on to prove that we are all here for a reason, and ultimately, out of our own choice.The film is also fantasy, though I wouldn't actually think of it as that. Because for one, it focuses more on the story and what is actually going on rather then the fact that magical things are happening. Which I actually kind of enjoyed. Sometimes I see a film that's fantasy (which I love fantasy), but really they took no time to develop the plot or characters.It wasn't what I would call genius in every sense of the word (like Lord of the Rings). But it didn't breach it's limits of what it could do, and it certainly brought to the screen enough captivating story, and skill to keep an audience interested. But this movie, it has a life of it's own! And I think it has personality more then all of the other fantasies or movies starring children made in recent years (not to mention some wonderful acting!). And I do believe it deserved and got the 20 minute standing ovation it did from the crowd at the Cannes film festival!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
22 minute standing ovation at Cannes says it all,"I happened to catch this film on a PPV channel recently and was really impressed having done a little bit of reading about it I read it got a 22 minute standing ovation at the Canne's Film Festival that is incredible. Guillermo Del Toro has created something that is really very special - its separated into different sections - part war movie, part fantasy, and really is a must see. There are some incredible performances in this film especially from Sergi Lopez as Captain Vidal and as central character Ofelia, newcomer Ivana Baquero delivered a performance that looked like that of somebody involved in the business for years! It might be a foreign language film, but the film relies on on screen action much more than that of dialogue and what bit there is has subtitles so its fine.Well worth a watch. Can't praise it enough.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Maybe del Toro got lost in this labyrinth,"One thing I feared, before watching the film and it became true. I felt, that this picture had more style than substance, as the in my opinion widely over-appreciated ""Hellboy"". The worlds characterized in this film are not really different, the point of the story is how you behave in a certain unreal environment. Evil and cowardly as Vidal does, or honorable and brave, as Ofelia. Specially that she allows her to make faults is nice, for I can see her little weaknesses in myself, like when she eats berries, knowing what the consequences are. Unfortunately what stays in the end is question marks, what did del Toro actually wanna say? You live on in the way you died? Glenn Miller just disappeared, is he only remembered for having disappeared? Certainly Not! In the end it is only important what you yourself see in a picture, but I don't see a lot. The cinematography is impressive as is the gore and the, in my opinion, unnecessary violence. Normally I like violence and gore in movies, but still they have to make sense, they have to be a part of telling the story, like in some good horror movies, where those two have a function. But why must Vidal repeatedly act as slaughterer? That is, as absurd as that may seems, regarding who the director is, totally lame.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

The Making of a Poem,"""El laberinto del Fauno"" is a poem. Delightful and frightening. The whispering woods, home to what will be an awful scenario of war, almost speak. They blow magically and enigmatically. The camera plays all the time, presenting the story in a smooth way, artistic and contemplative. The toying around with the focus makes the impression of a vivid experience, like we are really present in the story.The script is delicious; mixing two stories in one. The story of a war liberated in times of the decade on 1940, with the fascist army of Franco liberating a war against the rebels in the mountains. The other story centers on Ofelia, a girl whose mother engages with a cold-blooded, soul-less Captain Vidal that with the facility that he polishes clean his boots, fits his impeccable uniform and shaves with unsullied effort he can kill a man with no second thoughts, or torture a youngster with the same feeling. Sergi Lopez confers the character an incredible interpretation, with freezing looks and inhumane gestures.Ivana Baquero as young Ofelia does a flawless performance. The cast is superb, imposing realism over melodramatic attempts. Guillermo del Toro does a poetry work, something off the books of Hollywood with a fresh, innovative story.The greatest aspect of this film goes to the visuals. A stunning make-up that brings to life mythological creatures and a faultless art direction that with a small naive appearance imposes the world a breathtaking look. The contrast with the war freed upon the mountains makes this aspect a lot better. The managing to keep both of this worlds apart but innocently inter-related makes the experience breathtaking.This movie is a beautiful poem, written and directed in a mature and royal way. It may have a brutal imagine catalog but it's worth all the way. Keep it in Spanish to admire the softness of the language.Please watch this film, it's fierce good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Beautiful,"I saw this movie the first time for about six month ago, i loved it from the first time i saw it, now I've seen it a couple of times. What I love so much about this movie is the violence, those scenes you never expect to see in this type of movie. Me and some people I know that seen this movie thought it to be like a Spanish version of ""Narnia"". So once you start seeing it you understand that you were right, then everything falls to the ground when the officer breaks the skull on that old man.This movie beats all of the nominated movies in the academy award 2006, accept for MAYBE The Departed.This movie is the proof that movies are art.Its one of the best movie I have ever seen.I really wish Guillermo del Toro to direct a Harry Potter film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
A Fairytale of Utter Bueaty and Emotion,"'Pan's Labyrinth' is by far the best foreign film I have ever seen. It focuses on a young girl's adventure to travel back to her home: The Underworld, though that is not the only storyline in the splendidly nice film.The film has lies, war, blood, loss, death, and magic, all resulting in an extraordinary fairy-tale for grown ups.The acting is good and full of remorse even though it is in Spanish. Though the whole movie is told through subtitles, it is still easy to follow and entertaining.The music really helps expand the artful vision in the magical tale. The sets, monsters, and the whole world of the film is truly breathe taking for its Gothic touch of beauty.'Pan's Labyrinth' is a charming film that is fun and exhilarating to watch. This movie is original and unforgettable. It will always be a classic dark story of believing and never letting go of hope.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Such Brilliance,"Let me start by saying that this is not fantasy in the sense of Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, but something much deeper.The story takes place in late World War II Nationalist Spain. A little girl is pulled from her comfort zone and placed into the hills of northern Spain. In this new place, she is now under the cruel control of her (for lack of a better word) evil stepfather.Quickly she finds a Faun at the center of an old labyrinth in the countryside who sends her on a quest for immortality, as she performs three task. The less you know about the film going in, the better.It really helps this movie to understand the political climate of Spain at this time. Nationalist Spain had just undergone a Republican Spain, and had formulated a fascist government.Likewise you must understand that the main character is a young girl, and throughout the film she does things that young children do. Many viewers have complained about some of the protagonist actions, but that comes from a misunderstanding of the nature of children.While some people have been turned off by its use of subtitles, I humbly refute by arguing that the Spanish language lends such poetry to the dialog, that the movie would have been butchered in English.Along with the flow of dialog, you find that the score for the movie adds such a mood to the film that at some moments you can merely watch the actions taking place and listen to know what's going on.One final note is that this movie's use of literary devices (such a rarity in modern film). You have subtle foreshadowing to subtle, yet crucial plot points, and blatant foreshadowing to the shallower plot points. You have symbolism (to say what symbolizes what would ruin far to much) themes, motifs, allusions and some of the best characterization I've seen in years.Do NOT under any circumstance dismiss this movie as a childish fantasy and keep expecting David Bowie to pop out. This is a mature fairy tail that demands a mature interpretation from its viewers; It is flawless in every effort it makes. This is a truly unique experience that is not to be missed, and again the less you know going into it, the better",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Pan's Labyrinth Review,"Pan's Labyrinth is a fairy tale story for adults that centers on a young girls escape from reality, that reality being fascism in civil war-torn Spain circa 1944. Guillermo Del Toro's newest picture brings us adults back to the place fantasies like The Never Ending Story did when we were children. The sheer darkness and violence of the fantasy segments perfectly complement the blood and torture portrayed during the war scenes. Ofelia, not being able to grasp what is going on around her, escapes into a world of faun's and fairies which at times are scarier than the real villain of the film, Captain Vidal played with by venerated Spanish actor Sergi Lopez. The real praise, when it comes to performance, must be handed to Maribel Verdu who's fear and inspiration for freedom are truly envisioned through her eyes. Del Toro does use many transitions in the film that lend to a one-shot impression, by using trees and walls to cut from one angle to another, something Hitchcock used to make Rope look like one unbroken shot. These transitions lend greatly to the stories two parallel universes, making them equally real to me as the two came closer and closer to intersecting. Ofelia's world of imagination is filled with over-sized frogs, bugs and various creatures made from the earth, that crawl in and out of the film seamlessly, complementing the editing.Pan's Labyrinth, written and directed by Del Toro, is a very personal film, and helps cement Del Toro as one of the better filmmakers within the science-fiction fantasy genre. Like the title suggests, Pan's Labyrinth creates a very intricate, elaborate maze, using its two stories to switch paths as you get lost within Del Toro's alluringly perceptive direction. Del Toro's use of CGI is very minimal, but mixed with the make-up effects conjures a very memorable, time-standing world of fantasy. This is, without a doubt one of the most beautiful films of the year, and along with its aesthetic sensibility, Pan's Labyrinth has painted a perfect anti-fascist story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
"Beautiful, haunting, heartbreaking. An instant classic.","Pans labyrinth is the story of an 11 year old girl, Ofelia, growing up during the Spanish civil war. The step-daughter of the ruthless captain, and her pregnant mothers health worsening everyday, Ofelia finds reality a cruel place. So she escapes, to her own fantasy world when she discovers a fairy lurking in the woods. Before long she is lead to a faun who informs her that she is in fact a long lost princess reincarnated. But before she can claim her rightful place on the throne she must prove herself with three dangerous tasks. As Ofelias' world deteriorates around her, her reality and fantasy worlds begin to blur together as she realises that the world is a cruel and terrible place.Guillermo Del Toro directs this haunting tale with a beauty and style all his own. A mention of course should go to the arts department(which Guillermo himself apparently helped with) and special effects that work to bring Ofelias' amazing fantasy to life. The juxtaposition between Ofelias' fractured fairytale and the real world is balanced perfectly. All these elements come together to tell an age old tale of magic, innocence, beauty and tragedy.A classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
One of the most beautiful works of cinematic art,"Five years have passed since the end of the Spanish civil war, but the biggest European conflict to date, the second World War, is still running strong. A fairy tale loving, innocent girl, Ophelia, and her pregnant mother move into a military base in the middle of a savage and unforgiving guerrilla warfare ridden countryside of Spain. The land has its stories of lore and mystique, which Ophelia ends up finding as an escape from the grim reality which is her life, and which end up being the defining point of her whole life. Her future lies beyond three tasks given to her by creatures never seen by anyone else alive.This film was one of the most touching and beautiful things I have ever seen. The direction, editing, and - most of all - acting was beyond words. I am a complete stranger to Spanish cinema, but whatever it may be, this is very probably considered a masterpiece there too.The film itself is a dark fantasy film set in the middle of the biggest war in recorded history. The mud, blood, fear and primal human actions are presented to the viewer in a way that really makes one immerse into the story and its setting. But it also succeeds in being a story based in a war zone without being an actual war film.Ivana Baquero as Ophelia does, right next to Natalie Portman in Leon, the most convincing and emotional child actor role I have ever witnessed in any film. She is a beautiful and charismatic actor who alone makes this film more than worth watching. Sergi López is very convincing and scary in the role of the ruthless captain Vidal, and every other actor seem to work around those two mentioned characters like they were born to do it.The cinematography and editing have nothing to do with the modern, ""fashionable"" gimmicks so many films cling to nowadays. Most of the cuts are subtle and graceful, and take advantage of the surrounding set. One of the few reasons I will not give this film a 10/10 rating is the poor portrayal of firearm usage. But even that does not bother me that much with this film, which i can honestly call a masterpiece.All in all, I recommend this film to everyone. If you like fantasy, watch this. If you like war films, watch this. If you like films in general, watch this. And, most of all, if you have never watched a film before, watch this as your first one. Your two hours will not be spent for nothing.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Unbelievably violent,"I was very disappointed that this film that looks so magical in the trailers is unbelievably violent. And most of this violence was gratuitous and wasn't necessary for this particular story. Although it's about the fascists in Spain during WWII and you would expect a certain amount of violence in a story like this it was so over the top I almost walked out at two points in disbelief. Be warned that the trailer doesn't give you any clues of what this film is really about and if you're thinking about taking teenagers forget it. Having said that, it's not without merit but it wasn't what I was led to expect and therefore a huge disappointment. My daughter and husband felt the same way and they can handle violence more than I can. My husband actually thought that the violence in Apocalypto was easier to take because it made sense in that story. This was just too much.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Simply Spectacular!,"Pan's Labyrinth reignites the imagination and blows typical Hollywood films out of the water. Pan's Labyrinth is fantasy story telling at its best. As an adult, I was carried away on the wings of Del Torro's tale. I realize that there has been complaints from some viewers about the strong violence. Come on people! This is a HORROR fantasy tale. It is raw and original. I didn't find Pan's Labyrinth to be overly violent. I found it real, but I guess if you have a weak stomach, maybe you should skip this one. However, you should be aware that you will be missing out on some great storytelling. This film has been added to my top 10 of all time and comes highly recommended. Guillermo Del Torro definitely scores big with his original screenplay and I can't wait for his next film. Bravo!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
"Not a masterpiece, but a master of pieces","An intriguing mixture of fantasy and period drama, this curious hybrid moves along wonderfully but seems a tad overrated in my book, perhaps due to a lavish praise being heaped upon the very concept itself, which may ignore some of the smaller lulls that weigh down the film a bit. By no means slow-paced or uninspired, Pan's Labyrinth still flounders slightly with it's somewhat forced contrasts in brutality and magic.Everyone has been praising writer/director Guillermo del Toro's visionary tactics enabling the film to walk a fine line between the stark, fascist violence that exists in the 1944 Spanish villa owned by a tyrannical general, and the surreal, escapist world the general's soon to be daughter wields as her defensive mechanism in coping with her depressed reality. Slipping further and further into the backyard woods that eventually becomes the visually intensive labyrinth of discussion, del Toro does create a fascinating parallel world, but in contrasting the two, becomes a little more tedious then I was led to believe.Young Ofelia's various ""quests"", through which the fantasy arc takes root, are visually inventive but do not make for much of a convincing narrative, mostly feeling pieced together instead of a cohesive adventure. Despite the rigorous attention to set design which complement the original creatures, the contrasting world of reality appears littered with stereotypes and a stifled predictability.While I would not call this all important contrasting of realities underutilized, I also would certainly not call it completely adept; Del Toro has moved away from the adolescent joys of previous work, but still has a little to go before making a certifiable masterwork. Still, the overwhelming technical proficiency demonstrated mostly in the engrossing fantasy sequences prove to flesh out a further emotional and mental statement that help make Pan's Labyrinth one of the more mature and critically acclaimed fantasy films to come along in years.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
I waited so long to be rewarded with disappointment,"I have read the wonderful reviews, waited in anticipation (could not make it to see it at the movies), and attempted to watch Pan's Labyrinth tonight. What a horrible disappointment. I was expecting more of the magic of 'The Devil's Backbone,"" but what I was rewarded with was a torture-fest that looked like it was directed by Mel Gibson. Much like 'The Passion of the Christ' took a holy subject and degraded it by turning into one of Mel's studies in male homophobic S&M themes, this movie was often tauted as an adult fairy tale. Only if we as adults have decomposed our standards so that torture and suffering constitute fairy tales. Fool me once, shame on you...I will not make any future efforts to see this director's works. Only a small percentage of the movie is dedicated to the fairy tale theme of Pan's Labyrinth, the rest is a poor version of Texas Chainsaw Massacre meets Passion of the Christ meets Apocalypse Now. Save your money.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Without a doubt the most potent foreign film I've seen in years,"If there's anything to complain about, it might be that the art direction is a little too dark, although this movie IS about the trials of a princess of the underworld. Otherwise, I can't help thinking that the little girl in ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and the ubiquitous Dakota Fanning must both want to hide under a rock after watching Ivana Baquero as Ofelia. Between her and Sergi Lopez as the Capitan, this movie is a sheer performance delight.It's almost incomprehensible how much more than that the director managed to effortlessly pack into two hours. We learn all we need to know about Fascism and the Spanish Civil War with such story telling power that it's a little disconcerting. Add fully developed themes about the rigors of child birth and the demands of motherhood, how true nobility is related to moral and physical courage, and infuse it all with a wonderful sense of justice and you've got an unforgettable film of monumental beauty.I don't doubt some people will be put off by this film's moral sensibilities, but I also don't doubt there's no group more in need of this film than those people. And I sincerely hope teenagers get to see it. It might have the most impact on them. I don't agree at all with those who think it's too graphic in places.Bravo Guillermo del Toro!

A History of Magic,"A quick comment: I just saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival and it was absolutely brilliant. My only problem was that I didn't understand Spanish, so I constantly had to take my eyes off the beautiful images to look at the annoying subtitles. I think that what made this movie truly incredible was the combination of utterly fantastic fantasy and stunningly brutal realism. Some of the scenes with Captain Vidal were very reminiscent of Cronenberg's work in ""A History of Violence"". There's no fantasy movie I can think of that's exactly like the elements you see in this one, but in those parts of the movie it was almost like ""Labyrinth"" taking a few steps toward ""The Cell"" and stopping before it crossed the threshold. I know how stupid it is to compare something this original to anything else, but I think it's a useful frame of reference. If you do go see it, prepare for magic, prepare for violence and prepare to be stunned. Del Toro does it again!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
The Labyrinth experience...,"There are very few films which provide a viewing experience which is riveting as well as moving at the same time. Guillermo Del Toro takes us to another world in his masterpiece, Pan's Labyrinth, which is perhaps the best film he has ever made.I have seen his earlier works like The Devil's Backbone which was a decent watch, and Cronos, which I hated!But I was awestruck by what I saw in Pan's Labyrinth, a haunting film which is difficult to get out of your head long after you've finished watching.Revealing much about the plot will take out most of the fun of watching the movie. But just to make a mention, the story is set in post-Civil War Spain in 1944. Ofelia, a little girl, along with her pregnant mother travel to the mountains to join her stepfather, Captain Vidal where his military outfit is in the process of exterminating guerrillas. Shortly, Ofelia comes across an old Labyrinth in which she meets a faun, who gives her some very interesting information. And then, amidst the conflict between the guerrillas and the Captain's army, Ofelia finds herself getting into a rather mysterious adventure....Technically, Pan's Labyrinth scores in almost every department. The background score by Javier Navarrete is superb and brilliantly haunting. Guillermo Navarro's cinematography is fantastic and perfectly brings out the bleak atmosphere to go with the proceedings of the story. And of course, there's some frighteningly well-done special effects and makeup effects by David Marti' and others. Performances from all of the cast are wonderful. Most notably, of course, Ivana Baquero, Sergi López and Maribel Verdú. Lopez is so good as the ruthless Captain, that you cannot help but loathe him! Ivana turns in a poetic performance as Ofelia, the lead character. Likewise Maribel Verdu as Mercedes, the housekeeper.Pan's Labyrinth, as rightly described by Guillermo Del Toro, is a fairy tale for adults. It has it's fair share of violence and some gruesome scenes which may be difficult for the squeamish to watch. But this movie deserves to be watched by one and all. It is one of those tales of finding hope amidst despair, but quite different in many ways from all other films with a similar message.The acclaim this film received is well-deserved.Do not miss!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Fantastic,"El Laberinto del Fauno is a true tale of fantasy and imagery. It mixes the fantasy world of a small girl and the cruelty of the war in a very subtle manner. This film captures all the magical elements in a fairy tale and it is presented in an exquisite and elegant manner by Guillermo del Toro, which I might add is the greatest Mexican filmmaker today.I do not recall any other Mexican films that deal with the fantasy/horror genre like this one does. As a matter of fact, most Mexican films are always trying to be controversial by using sexual scenes and bad language and also by showing us the corruption, politics and poverty of Mexico.El Laberinto del Fauno does none of the above.

Ying and Yang,"After the overwhelming nominations at the Oscars that Pans Laberyth got, I have to say that I was definitely fascinated with this film and wanted to see what it was about. When it went to rental, I couldn't help but notice the R-Rating, which seemed a little odd. But I now know why, this was definitely one of the darkest fantasy films I have ever seen. That's why I said Ying and Yang, it seemed like it had a very dark side, but also a slightly brighter one where this girl travels into her own fantasy world where she is a princess. This film had fascinating characters, a very interesting story, and was beautifully shot, so I can see where it stands on the top 250 and got the Oscar nods it got.Ofelia, a little girl, is going with her pregnant mother to a city in Spain, where there is a huge war going on. They are traveling to see the very sadistic and cruel captain of the army, the mother has married him and he is now Ofelia's new father. But Ofelia comes into a world of her own when a fairy brings her to a Labyerth in the garden where she meets a faun and he tells her that he is her servant, and he can help her bring back her thrown to the kingdom by doing a few simple tasks, well, not that simple. But it makes it all the more difficult with the world outside, where her father is murdering others and doesn't care about her mother, only the son she carries inside her.This was truly an interesting film, in some ways it was a breath of fresh air due to the fact that we don't really have any films like this any more. The cast, the set, the story, the language was so beautiful, I was very impressed. I would recommend this film, not so much to just anyone, it takes a certain type of person I think to fully understand what this film and story is, not judging, just saying I can already name a few people I know who wouldn't enjoy this movie because they wouldn't understand it. But if you are a fan of film, the art of it, I think you'll enjoy this masterpiece.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
In a World Without Hope - Part 2,"Having already spoken my mind on the movie The Children of Men, I thought it would be appropriate to see the remaining two movies from this Mexican/Latin/Spanish Trilogy, Babel and Pan's Labyrinth. Having now seen these three movies, I am convinced that the gods of cinema have transferred the various skills of movie-making to invaders from outside its Cathedral, Hollywood, the New Spanish Armada if you must, forcing the powers that control the purse strings, to allow this sudden and dramatic burst of energy and creativity to infiltrate an establishment that has gotten lazy and too comfortable.What is common in all three movies is that they are extremely strong when it comes to the basics. With scripts that are complete and cohesive, absorbing and extremely effective. All the techniques of the film-making process; from the cinematography, to sound, to the editing and acting; bring to life in a most wonderful way, the power and the drama that is inherent in the written words and sentences, in the tragic nature of the characters, their relationships and conflicts, and in the brutality and honesty with which the story unfolds out there on the silver screen, in front of our very eyes.Having now gathered all the resources and the sophisticated technology, and assembled the talent, it will all be a waste if there is no direction, a unique perspective, a singular point of view. This is the responsibility of the director. They must use their skill and imagination, and the resources at their disposal to create the magic. All the three directors have succeeded beyond expectation, and have created masterful art works that have, to a certain extent shaken the established order of things. They have all shown commitment and dedication, and displayed a passion and desire to express themselves through their movies without any reservations or shyness, telling the story as it was created, with all its brutality and honesty, refusing to compromise. Sometimes, as one watches these movies it can get frightening, and in spite of your self you want to tell them to stop, that is enough. There were one or two instances in the movies Babel and Pans Labyrinth, towards the end, where I thought they had taken things to far.Pans Labyrinth has a more classical style to it, with rich deep colors, a wonderful feel and texture, with an old fashioned sensibility, looking almost like a black and white movie. The characters are extremely well defined, naive and idealistic in their passions and beliefs. The camera movements are often slow and deliberate, sometimes opening up the scene to include all the details and emphasizing each and every feeling and emotion the creators want to convey to the audience.It is set in the past, and has as its central theme, a conflict between two fundamental ideologies, two ""isms"". In many ways the movie is much like Children of Men, the difference being in style; one unfolds like a Greek Tragedy and the other has a nervous energy to it and is set in the future. In both movies, it is difficult to separate the good from the evil, as both groups of people, those that belong with the systems of power and authority and those that are fighting the totalitarian regime's, will use any means possible to achieve their eventual goals and in the end one begins to question what are the goals. Both movies emphasize the idea that when man looses hope and belief, he also looses those elements that separate us from the rest of the animals, a Conscience, Morality and Virtue, Justice and The Rule of Law. It is the young innocent mind of a child that suffers the most in a world with no hope.When children grow up without hope or belief, they will seek anything or any form or entity that will provide them with a sense of belonging. It becomes natural and normal for them to do everything and anything to protect what they believe to be a safe haven, never questioning the motives of their superiors or the means used to protect the power, for them it is obvious and rational. Some will be persuaded to seek in another human or group of people a reason for their angst, and will use their skills and genius in finding the means, to seek what they believe to be a just cause, a final solution.Captain Vidal is just such a character, the uniform and the trappings of office, give him a sense of importance and a meaning to life. It is interesting to note that just before watching this movie, I had a watched a documentary on PBS, about the last years of Auschwitz. It gives you an insight into the nature of Rudolf Hoess, the SS Kommandant of Auschwitz, and Adolph Eichmann, head of the SS in Hungary. Sergi Lopez as Capitan Vidal gives a brilliant performance and should have been honored for his work.When Ofelia realizes that her mother has given up all hope of surviving alone, submitting herself to the devil's care, she seeks, in the world of her imagination, the truth, where the gods do actually exist and miracles do happen and where humans will be actually punished for seeking what does not belong to them. When fantasy meets reality, the end result is tragic and painful; at least it was for me, as I watched the story unfold. Do the gods of Ofelia's imagination or those from Ancient Mythology really exist, do we finally achieve immortality when we die and leave this cursed earth. Are we to be forever punished by the gods and denied an Earthly Paradise for being weak and mortal. Should a child not dream of a better world for herself and her family? Is their no hope then for the human race? Important questions these movies demand of the audience, to consider and debate.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
A unique and dark approach to a fairytale,"Ofelia (Baquero) loves reading fairy tales and during the 1944 Spanish war, she is asked by a faun to complete 3 tasks which will make her a princess.Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy) uses his visionary genius to bring a dark and dramatic fairytale to life in this Oscar winning picture.Filled with surprises, dramas and a dark twists upon fairy tales, Pan's Labyrinth is both different and unique in its own genre and fills a viewer's watching requirements with stunning entertainment throughout.The general surprise of seeing a fairytale told in such a dark and dramatic way is what makes the film so appealing. How many fairy tales are realistic? How many are dark and reflect the true nature of their time? All run on the same format and offer no new thrills, but Pan's Labyrinth is unique and brilliant in achieving that diverse effect.Toro's direction, plot and the costume design all come together superbly to achieve a dark and dismal reflection on Ofelia's life, and believe the plaudits, because this is one of the finest and imaginative films you will ever see. Toro is lining up to become the next Tim Burton with the use of dark materials and Gothic imagery.The writing is equally impressive with plenty of twists and turns and a strong focus upon each character's personal issues. There was slight confusion regarding the beginning in relation to the ending on the first watch, but it is well worth watching again.The plot is driven by fantasy and escapism, with Ofelia desperate to escape the war and set things right. Baquero is excellent as central character Ofelia and will set your hearts racing with a brilliant young performance.Each character is interesting, from the stubborn and violent Captain Vidal to the silent and professional Mercedes, the film portrays realism through the realistic characters and their lives. The writing and dialogue keeps the audience hooked as Toro delivers twist after twist in a highly dramatic plot.The use of fantasy was a necessity and was pulled off tremendously well, through the use of unbelievable creatures. From a gigantic frog to a blind hellish creature, Toro gives viewers a variety and an image that will be cemented into anyone's memory forever after watching. The settings help achieve the graphic and dark imagination behind the creatures, none more so than the labyrinth.Pan's Labyrinth simply achieves everything that a good film should need to, great direction, plot and characters.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
"""Awful"" doesn't begin to describe it...","This movie could well be one of the worst films ever made. I only wish I could give it the negative-ten stars it richly deserves. Indeed, I only continued to watch it (after the first graphic and brutal murder) to see the depths to which film making of this type can sink.How deep can it sink then? Very deep...deeper in fact than you can possibly imagine. This movie has not the slightest speck of originality, wit, or even meaning in it. From beginning to end, it is no more than a sadistic gore-fest masquerading as an art film. As for its vaunted production values, I find myself astounded that anyone would find them remarkable. Design? It's all been done before in any one of dozens of modern fantasy movies. (Here I must admit, however, that I am puzzled that modern movie goers still find that sort of thing interesting. Special effects have now reached a level of sophistication beyond which there can be little technical improvement. As a result, no bizarre fantasy, no matter how gloriously depicted, will ever enchant the intelligent viewer--unless the images can engender something more than a ""gee, whiz"" responsethat is, unless the images mean something.) Creating images with meaning is what good film making has always been all about. But the images in this film mean nothing. The story is bankrupt, too, with characterizations that are laughably cartoonish, and implied values that are hopelessly vague, jejune, or even outright contradictory.However, even worse than the movie itself, perhaps, is the moronic praise that this piece of tripe has garnered in what (I am now realizing) is a depressingly demented world of film criticism.Alas, further words fail me. But there are a good number of well-written reviews on this site that take the time to painstakingly spell out some of the many shortcomings of the film. So, if you despise this movie as much as I do, I heartily recommend perusing those reviews as an antidote to the pain and outrage you are feeling at, A) having wasted your time on this stuff, and B) having shaken your head to the point of a headache at the critical praise that has been heaped on it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
One of the best films in a long time,"Simply put: Pan's Labyrinth is one of the most beautiful, best written, best directed, and best acted films of all time. The screenplay drips with symbolism in this critique on fascism and unquestioned authority. Though I went into the film expecting fantasy, I came out more satisfied than I could have ever imagined when I first walked in the theater.From the first scene to the ending credits, this movie brings you right in to the countryside of Franco's Spain and it never lets you go. Ofelia's acting is superb, along with the supporting cast. Also, the final scene is one of the most beautiful and touching scenes that I have ever witnessed. If you are not stirred emotionally, in some way, by the final scene, you should just stop going to movies, because nothing is going to be able to move you.A most well deserved 10/10. See this movie immediately if you have not done so yet.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
A personal film about memory,"Guillermo Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth has been called a fairy tale, but it is one without the color, warmth, or wonder we normally associate with films of this type. Rather, it owes more to the Latin genre of magic realism, as it reflects the grim fantasies of a young child caught in the middle of a brutal conflict and her desperate longing for a world without pain. Set in Spain after Franco had emerged victorious in the Spanish Civil War, Nationalist troops and die hard resistance fighters continue the struggle in the Spanish countryside. As the film opens, Carmen (Ariadna Gil) and her daughter Ofelia, brilliantly performed by Ivana Baquero, are traveling to join Carmen's new husband, Falangist Captain Vidal (Sergei Lopez) in his military headquarters.Ofelia, a bright, imaginative girl of ten, carries with her books of fairy tales. Her father, a tailor, died a few years ago in the war, and her mother is pregnant with the baby the Captain believes will be his son. When they stop to rest, the little girl meets a buzzing dragonfly and believes it to be a fairy welcoming her to a magic realm. In a voice-over, we hear the story of an underground country where ""there are no lies and no pain"", a metaphor perhaps for the thousands of Franco resisters who were forced to go underground. In this country, a young princess named Moanna is mourned after she leaves the realm to explore life on Earth and is blinded by the sun and dies. Her father, the King of the Underworld, however, has never given up hope that the princess will one day return in another incarnation.When Ofelia reaches the mill which has been converted into a military headquarters, she discovers an ancient stone labyrinth near her new home and meets seven-foot tall Pan, a half-man half-goat ""faun"", (Doug Jones) who tells her that she is the princess who everyone in his kingdom has longed for. To return to her true home and be reunited with her father, however, she must complete three arduous tasks, revealed to her by touching the blank pages of large notebook. These include encountering a huge toad in the roots of an old fig tree and retrieving a key from his stomach, and searching for a dagger in a room guarded by another gruesome creature, the Pale Man, whose eyeballs are in the palm of his hands. The room is filled with delectable treats but Ofelia is sworn not to eat them.The film shifts seamlessly between fantasy sequences and the armed conflict. Vidal is depicted as a soldier who takes pleasure in killing. In one scene, he sadistically beats a peasant to death with a bottle, suspecting him of being a rebel. His cruelty is not limited to rebels, however. When Carmen becomes sick during her difficult pregnancy, the girl hears her stepfather tell the doctor that if it comes to a choice between saving the mother or saving the baby, he wants him to save the baby. Amidst all the darkness, Ofelia develops a warm relationship with the housekeeper, Mercedes (Maribel Verdu), whom she later discovers sneaks out at night to bring messages, food, and medical supplies to the rebels. The Captain is merciless when he discovers Mercedes' ""treason"" as well as that of Dr. Ferreiro (Alex Angulo) who refuses to obey Vidal's orders.As the world around her grows darker and her mother becomes sicker, Ofelia further retreats into her dream world. Soon she must make the most difficult choice any person can be asked to make. Pan's Labyrinth is a strong and heartfelt film but it is a mostly gloomy affair and I yearned for some light and warmth to pervade the darkness, but the film does not go there except for a few brief moments. Del Toro's work, however, is not about metaphysics or spirituality. It is a personal film about memory and, as both Ofelia and Vidal remember their fathers, del Toro wants the world to remember the sadistic nature of the Franco regime, the courage of those who stood up to its brutality, and the innocence his country lost forever.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Unbelievable!,"This movie was by-far the most extraordinary movie I've seen to date. Although very graphic, its special effects and character flare were beyond reproach. This is a must-see movie; however, even though it's a fairy tale, it's not one I would recommend for children. This is, though, definitely one to see in the theater.Without spoiling the film, I will say that it was filmed only in Spanish and contains subtitles, which only detract from the film in-that you must read when you know the scenes are phenomenally achieved. The fact that this film is set in near-post-WWII adds to the drama involved in the intertwined fairy tale.Enjoy the film and take back a bit of fantasy as you leave the auditorium. ;-)",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

One night, she finds a fairy that takes her to the labyrinth in the garden outside where she meets a faun creature that tells her to do many tasks for she escapes from the depressing reality of war.Spectacular and unique adult horror fantasy that is perhaps the best modern fairy tale there might be!

Guilermo Del Toro (""Hellboy"", ""Blade 2"", ""Devil's Backbone"" and ""Cronos"") brings a thrilling, powerful and sometimes macabre story that blends the horrors of war with the fantasy innocence of youth, this is probably one of the best foreign movies i've ever seen and one of the best horror & fantasy movies i've ever watched.A wonderful and dark film that has to be seen to believed! truly a recommended movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
10 out of 10.,The best movie this year. Made me put down my popcorn for the first time. I was enjoying every second of it- and didn't want to leave after it was finished. For a second I even considered clapping my hands- if not for my girlfriend asking me if I want to go to the bar and why there is still popcorn in the bag.It is really strange that here in London it is shown in just a few cinemas on small screens. It is also really sad that James Bond is making headlines and attracting crowds- when there is such a wonder to watch instead.I did eventually end up in a bar by the way.,10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Best Del Toro film to date,"As of last night this movie more than surprised me, not only in content, but acting. The primary actors were just too good to be true. One of Del Toro's earlier projects was El Espinazo del Diablo 'The Devil's Backbone' and I though of it as too good. Del Toro's imagination is macabre to the extreme, but not evil macabre like George Romero. The most sadistic character so far is Sergi Lopez portrayal of Captain Vidal, set in 1944 in which Franco's soldiers were fighting to finally push back any rebels against Franco's evil regime Vidal was one of the most sadistic bastards on screen, ihated him so much for being cruel, twisted and perverse. Other portrayals was a young lady Ivana Baquero, the movie primarily revolves around her and her imagination of fairies and fauns and nasty creatures. Her portrayal of Ofelia was second to none for an actress under 17 and amongst some of the best acting. I will not say the movie was gory, but there are scenes of torture, sick and twisted visual effects, violence involving minors, apathy in the part of Vidal for his wife, and pure casualties of war of both guilty and innocent parties whether directly involved with the revolution or just innocent bystanders. The Faun let's say, will give you a mixed feeling and reaction to his true intents. But the best part of the movies involves a self sacrifice, that will give me a rating of this movie a ""10"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Interesting,I thought this film from a technical perspective was very well done. But I have to say that the adult characters were much more interesting than watching the antics of Ofelia (especially in her Alice in Wonderland dress). Her story was all too familiar and I knew exactly what was going to happen before it happen. It was the same for the adult characters and its too bad that the fantasy that Ofelia had didn't incorporate more of what was happening around her. The only connection appeared to be with her mother and that's ashame. Also the task that the faun had her do seemed to say nothing about her situation or the situation of those around her. It also would have been nice to know more about the Captain and his relationship to his father and why a son was so important to him. All in all a good technical film with story flaws. 7/10,7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

I know competition was tough but this film was certainly better than Babel,Letters from Iwo Jima and the Queen. Or was it simply because it was a foreign film;for which it didn't get anything either.

Sergi López plays Carmen Vidal a powerful captain given the task of riding the hills of the Spanish republicans, an unforgettable performance by Ivana Baquero as Ofelia, a young girl trapped in a world of torture and war.

Fairy Stories are not Always for Children,"The Spanish-language film, ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" has perhaps the most misleading trailer in recent memory. Scenes of a young girl, a faun, and tiny fairies suggest a film that might be appropriate for children. Wrong. This often-brutal tale that takes place in Spain during World War II contains graphic violence and enough horrors to induce nightmares in the young or even in adults sensitive to suggested torture. However, when taken as an adult fairy tale with political overtones, the film rates among the best of the past year.Like other films about children who try to escape from an unpleasant reality into a fantasy world, writer-director Guillermo del Toro's ""Pan's Labyrinth"" immerses a young girl in the loveless household of her mother's second husband, a cruel captain in Generalissimo Franco's army. While her mother fades away as a difficult pregnancy saps her strength and a cold marriage destroys her will, the young girl is convinced by a faun that she is a princess of the underworld and need only complete three tasks to return and reclaim her rightful role.The cast is superb. Young Ivana Baquero plays Ofelia, the dethroned princess, with skill beyond her years, and Maribel Verdu is excellent as Mercedes, a compassionate servant with a secret. However, the standout is Sergi Lopez, who imbues the monstrous Captain Vidal with a cold cruelty that is evident from his first scene when he meets Ofelia. The politics of the filmmakers are unmistakably anti-fascist, and Lopez portrays Vidal with relish as an amoral, emotionless monster, who will stop at nothing in his battle against those who oppose Franco. Add first-rate production values, a delicate score by Javier Navarrete, and a captivating script and this Spanish-Mexican co-production emerges as a vastly entertaining gem for adults.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

A stunning reminder of the harshness of childhood...,"There is no one more creative than a child in the dark. As children, almost all of us were overcome by the most macabre leaps of the imagination once our parents had left us alone in our beds, vulnerable and scared. Suddenly every sound was a death threat, every shifting beam from the street transformed into the glare of a burglar's flashlight. Logic was swiftly made malleable; the most bizarre events could be thrown together by youthful paranoia to explain the circumstances by which a mummy could be lurking in the closet, a decaying skeleton under the bed. It was all terrifying, and for a child whose mind was still unadulterated by reason, it was all very real. Guillermo del Toro's new film ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is one of the best movies to come along in a while for many reasons, but it is most unique in the way it has perfectly captured the terrors of childhood, both real and imaginary. ""Pan"", like del Toro's previous gem ""The Devil's Backbone"", takes place against the backdrop of 1930's Spain during the country's civil war between Fascists and Soviets that had torn it apart, The main storyline revolves around Ofelia, played by a luminescent Ivana Baquero, a young girl who has retreated into novels and fairy tales to escape the harsh realities of her life. Her mother, a widow, is heavily pregnant with the child of Capitán Vidal, the deliciously malignant Sergi López, a fascist officer stationed at a dilapidated mill deep in the Soviet occupied Spanish forests. At Vidal's insistence Ofelia and her mother move there, a difficult journey and a heavy blow to the health of the weakened pregnant woman. Ofelia soon finds that she is anything but alone at the mill. Woken in the night by a noisy but amiable praying mantis, she follows the bug to a nearby labyrinth. At the maze's center she meets a faun, who soon sets her off on a series of tasks in order to escape the nightmares of her life. The quest she begins soon after is populated by creatures so freakish, so bizarre and yet simultaneously so familiar that only the mind of a child could have created them. The faun is a duplicitous, creaking old goat whose every movement is echoed by the sound of a branch breaking in the dark or the creak of a door in the night. A monstrous toad living in the bottom of an old oak encapsulates everything that is so paradoxically intriguing and repulsive about amphibians to little boys. The Pale Man, a cannibalistic monstrosity of skin and sinew, is lifted straight from Goya's painting of Saturn devouring his children, another work of art created in a mind tortured by the cruelty of the Spanish Civil War. Del Toro's monsters embody everything that is terrifying to children, brought to life so well that they are almost intolerable even in maturity. This is not a film for the squeamish, filled as it is with images of both horrific fantasy and blood which is all too real. Most of this blood is spilt by Capitán Vidal, whose tyranny is the focus of the film's other plot line. His dogged pursuit of the Communist forces is hampered by a rebellious but motherly housekeeper, played in a remarkable transformation by Maribel Verdú, the sexy older woman from ""Y tu mamá también"". Grimly set on the eradication and cleansing of Spain, his character gives the film important historical context, foreshadowing the beginning of Europe's own waking nightmare. Del Toro is thankfully not blunt enough to make the two plot lines parallel, instead allowing the audience to draw connections without hitting them over the head with them. About to lose her mother in childbirth, surrounded by death and the burgeoning forces of fascism, Ofelia's innocence brings into stark relief the fallen world of adults which lies around her. Del Toro has created a film which rings true because of the purity of it's' core, just a sad little girl whose dreams are being corrupted by the cruelty of her world. To bring the brutality of that world to us del Toro has resurrected our childhood nightmares, and they are more harrowing than we can ever remember.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
"A beautiful, moving and stunning film, easily the best film of 2006","Accompanied by her pregnant mother (Ariadna Gil), Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) moves from a Spanish city to the countryside to live with her new stepfather, Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez). During the night Ofelia meets a fairy and together they go to a pit in the centre of a nearby maze where they meet a faun (Doug Jones) that tells her she is a princess from another world. He explains to her that she needs to complete three gruesome, tough and dangerous assignments to be reunited with her father again. Meanwhile, she befriends a servant, Mercedes (Maribel Verdu), one of her only friends in the real world. This mixture of war, Gothic fantasy and drama happens to be a beautiful, moving and stunning film and the best to come around in some time (and deservedly received a 22 minute applause at the Cannes Film Festival).I personally could not wait to see this, as I love dark horror/fantasies. My expectations were high going into this, but when I walked out of the theatre I was one happy person, this movie fulfilled all my expectations and then some. Honestly, what I say cannot do this movie justice, it was an incredible experience now one of my favourite films. It is a brutally violent, moving, magical and at times lovely movie. Guillermo del Toro (who made the Spanish horror ""The Devil's Backbone"" and Hollywood blockbusters ""Blade II"" and ""Hellboy"") wrote and directed Pan's Labyrinth with an evident passion. The story flows beautifully, with no flaws and a smooth pace. Accompanied by del Toro's almost unmatched skill as a modern director, Pan's Labyrinth succeeds on all fronts. Javier Navarrete's incredible score is both touching and soothing and adds a huge emotional impact throughout the whole movie. The action sequences are shot stylishly and are incredibly bloody. Del Toro does not shy away from bloodshed in the real world and the magical world. Moreover, the fantasy elements are incredibly dark and adult and are not your typical Disney creatures which spontaneously burst into song. The creatures that Ofelia encounters are dark and scary looking things. The Faun, although a kind and gentle creature looks and sounds quite menacing and The Pale Man is easily the creepiest creation I have seen in a fantasy movie and although he has a short amount of screen time it's definitely an unforgettable thing.The acting is absolutely wonderful, especially from Baquero, who gives a powerful performance as young Ofelia. I can see her going far with the amount of talent she has. Lopez is very menacing and sadistic as the Captain, whenever he is on screen his presence immediately fills it. Kudos must go to Jones, who plays not only The Faun but also The Pale Man, he gives life to two polar creatures and as a result, breathes more life into an already perfect film. Also, the cinematography is gorgeous, Guillermo Navarro captures the gorgeous Spanish countryside, a war-torn city and Ofelia's fantasy world with striking beauty and grimness. If there is ever a list of must-see movies, this will surely be present. I urge anyone who has not seen this to see it without delay. Honestly, this movie is flawless in my books. Everything from the acting, the direction, the score and the cinematography, del Toro has created a cinematic treasure that any cinema geek should see now! 5/5",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

With its apparent small budget, i heard 5 million? this films special effects are very well done no matter how few they're are. The artistic angle of which this movie was created, is amazing, however it cannot be summed up in a review.

Guillermo del Toro's masterpiece,"El Laberinto del Fauno (The Labyrinth of the Faun) or Pan's Laybrinth as it's also known as is a great movie, it's a wonderful work of art created by Guillermo del Toro who also directed great films like Mimic, Blade II, Hellboy. The fantasy parts are amazing, the way the fantasy world and real world elements contrast makes this film unique. We see a nice, imaginative fable like world then we see a dark, violent real world. The way they contrast is pulled off impressively, Doug Jones who played Abe in Hellboy gets in creature make up again this time playing the Faun and the Pale Man. El Laberinto del Fauno, Pan's Labyrinth is also unique because it's an adult fantasy film, it's got violence, swearing and gore. I think that's what makes it so appealing because it's something different.El Laberinto del Fauno, Pan's Labyrinth is a masterpiece by Guillermo del Toro that should be seen.

Ugh,"And yuck. I found nothing outstanding about this movie, except the one-dimensionality beneath all its surface glitter. Cardboard characters, no matter how smooth or corrugated, remain what they are. I sense a political agenda at work, but am not aware enough of European history or religious/political cultural stereotypes to be sure what that agenda is. Anti-fascism is one thing, but the portrayal of 'bad guys' in this film is just too simplistic and laughable. Are western moviegoers so inured to media-spun fairy tales masquerading as reality that they can't recognize trite clichés when they see and read them? Poetic licence is one thing, but this movie IS for children, albeit the grown up variety. Most are obviously ecstatic about this film. So be it. It may be entertaining for some, but it's surely not a significant film.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this movie because of my interest in mythology and fantasy. Perhaps for that reason I was bound to be disappointed. I liked the acting by the little girl, and all of the female members of the cast, and the special effects worked well, though by modern standards they weren't that remarkable. For me, the film fell flat in the story, which was unoriginal, and unsatisfying. I was also put off by the repetitive and gratuitous-seeming violence. (The film had some of the most unconvincing gunfire I've seen since I was a kid, and the Spanish soldiers might has well have been made of tin.) There were a great many places where visual details, and camera work could have helped take us more into the story-environment (there was some good work here too, but not enough for me) but fundamentally, if you're doing a story about a girl who is escaping violence through the exploration of the nether world, she should stay in that world long enough for her (and the audience) to forget the violence for a while.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
I Have No Stomach for Gore and I LOVED Pan's Labyrinth,"Let me stress, this is not a film for children. It's more in the old-fashioned story-telling vain with true villains, tests of courage, and lot's of harsh lessons. It's like the version of Cinderella where her step-sister cuts off her toe to fit into the glass slipper (and you actually see the toe being removed).I wanted to address the gore in the film. Yes, the violence is harsh, but it's only on the screen for about 5 minutes out of the entire film. You can also tell when it's going to happen. The scene will build up to it. The visuals won't just cut to something gory then explain it later (like The Ring, which I had to walk out of because it was too graphic and scary). I had plenty of time to cover my eyes.From the other reviews I've read, I thought I was going to be bombarded by gore and violence, but this was not the case. The story starts at a mellow pace with pleasant imagery. It really captures the wonder and innocence of a child being introduced to a cruel and strange world (both real and fantasy). There is a definite Alice and Wonderland feel to the film, but it quickly spirals to something much darker than the Disney version.Pan's Labyrinth is two stories in one. There's the harsh reality of war versus a fantastical world based on myth and fairy tales. This film is what other films have been so desperately trying to be, but otherwise failing (The Brother's Grimm comes to mind).I love mythical, parable-type films and Pan's Labyrinth does a great job with wonderful story-telling, excellent acting, great character development, fine editing...the list goes on and on. Also, the CG is understated and beautiful.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
amazing movie,"I saw this movie a while back and I did not know what to expect. Everything in this film fits perfectly with the rest. Actors, make up, story, and of course the music.The movie seems kind of creepy but magical at the same timeIt makes me feel similar to when i watched Legend (80's), lots of dark elements, monsters but also love, motherhood, friendship, secret portals and dimensions which can make this movie very balanced, similar to several comic books but with a more twisted and realistic scenario going on behind all of the girl's imagination.I really like the acting in this film, and to be honest I hadn't noticed it until I finished watching the film. You get so stuck in the story and the plot that you barely notice if there are any problems with the film itself, tho at the end of the film you do realize how well shot it was, how good the acting was.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
The reality we invite our children to play.,"I had my first viewing last night and this is definitely one of the most imaginative stories I've seen in a while. The suspense this movie creates is a bloody thrill. Guillermo del Toro will be remembered forever for this work. There was no compromise made here on his part, and he was able to have a realized dream.This movie effectively drew the child & adult realities, and portrayed them both with fairness. The play these two realities create is what drives this movie. What it does best is to force the audience to question our world's constructed norms of bravery, courage, humanity, responsibility, truth and ultimately what is real?A great movie to me has become that which can create a deeper understanding by drawing connections throughout our joint realities and showing the significance any single action can cause. What is worth living for, and what is worth dying for. This story has an opinion, and I enjoyed it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
A Hauntingly Spectacular Labyrinth - One You Wouldn't Mind getting Lost In!,"Like any great myth, Pan's Labyrinth encrypts its messages through displays of magic. The result of the intricate interplay that we witness on screen is a fairy tale for adults that is violent, sometimes shocking, yet utterly engrossing.It's 1944 and Spain's Civil War has left the country ravaged and battling pockets of rebels. Posted to regain order in one such enclave, tyrannous Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez) travels to a remote home in North Spain with his pregnant wife and 12-year-old step- daughter, Ofelia (Ivana Baquero). Besotted with ancient tales, Ofelia disconnects from the violence around her by wandering into a derelict labyrinth to encounter creatures that once existed only in her fertile fantasies. Here she meets the garrulous faun who informs her she's the princess of a subterranean kingdom, and in characteristic fairy-tale fashion, she's given three tasks to perform before the full moon. And thus begins del Toro's unnerving fairy tale that blends fantasy and gloomy drama into one of the most magical films to come along in years.It's a heartbreaking tale of cruelty and hopelessness, softened only by the wondrous fantasy of Ofelia's imaginary world. A bold juxtaposition of real and unreal worlds is at the heart of Guillermo del Toro's visually inventive fantasy. Del Toro presents both the narrative strands as equally real, equally plausible. There's no attempt to rationalize Ofelia's parallel universe by suggesting it's a dream or a fantasy. In fact the two sides of the film come together to constitute an allegory about the soul and the national identity of Spain in an almost surreal fashion. Ivana Baquero is in brilliant form manifesting a child's fears and uncertainties through little more than widened eyes and shortened breath. Through sheer force of personality, Sergi López turns Captain Vidal into a convincing yet allegorical metaphor for chauvinistic masculinity and in the end, offers an incomparably sinister character.Guillermo Del Toro gives us a film which is both searing and haunting as it takes us from the bleak to the sublime. It imagines both the beauty and horror inherent to escapism and, while weaving an intricate tale, vividly draws a world more enticing but no more monstrous than our own. The spell it casts lingers long after the final reel!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"

An amazing adventure with Guillermo del Toro.,I will try to keep this review short and to the point without containing any spoilers(i don't like spoiling movies for those who haven't seen it).Guillermo is an awesome director/writer. Whatever he visualizes is reflected on film in a way that it feels like you're in his brain. And this movie is no exception. The story is set in 1944 Spain. And i have to say i'm not much of a movie buff but it's filmmakers like Mr Del Toro that really suck me in to their work from the first minute mark(no matter what the topic is). I love the visuals and being that i don't understand Spanish it didn't feel like a foreign movie because in a way you can understand everything that's going on. The acting the movement. It translates well to any country. This movie i feel can be enjoyed by any age demographic. Sure there's a little blood and violence. But i do believe the message is there outweigh whatever negative a parent can find. I thoroughly enjoyed myself watching this roller coaster ride of emotions. Because (trust me when i say this) you will be glued to your screen the moment you see beautiful Ofelia.8/10,8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Pan's Labyrinth,"I think this is my favourite film, as yet, from Guillermo del Toro - and it gets better the more you watch it. Set against at backdrop of a Spain still trying to recover from it's civil war, the young ""Ofelia"" and her pregnant mother ""Carmen"" are sent to live with the rather brutish ""Capt. Vidal"". Now he is a singularly nasty piece of work and the girl longs to meet her own real father. It's in the middle of the night that ""Ofelia"" encounters a sprite who offers her some hope. It knows of a faun in the middle of a maze who might be able to help, and so they set of in search of this ostensibly sagely and benign creature. The meeting offers her far more than a glimmer, she need only complete three tasks and will find herself taking up her inheritance as a princess and reunited with her kingly father. What now ensues is a fairy tale full of dark magic and untrustworthy characters whom the young girl must face if she is to succeed. Given the atrocities being carried out in the real world around her, she seeks more and more solace in this nether world that is probably just as dangerous - it certainly has it's fair share of malevolence and duplicity - but with her father the ultimate goal, she perseveres with wisdom and gritty determination. What makes this work is the delicious permutations of evil it offers. Contrasting the real with the fabled, the human with the fantasy - and the decency the young girl epitomises is by no means certain of success. The visual effects cleverly integrate both of her worlds without dominating the look of the film or the potency of the story - one of love, ambition, fear, trickery. It's creatively exciting and captivating too. This is storytelling at it's best, and on a big screen can be appreciate to it's full - and dazzling - effect.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Absolutely unnecessary violence,"This Spanish-Mexican film, also known by the title 'Pan's Labyrinth' (nothing to do with Peter Pan, in case you're thinking that because of the ""Pan""), is not what it seems. This films fools anyone who is expecting a fantasy film. It happened to me. I didn't hear about this movie until some time before I watched it.Despite me not knowing very well what to expect from it, I expected a movie of fantasy and magic. Something in the line of 'Alice in Wonderland' and 'Labyrinth' but better than 'Labyrinth'. But it ended up not being anything of what I imagined. And not in the good sense...Aside some beautiful backgrounds/landscapes and a relatively well made labyrinth, most of the movie is horrible. It is violent in the maximum sense of the word. No kidding. It's not a movie with just one or another brief scene of violence. There is brutal violence in many scenes. It's too much and that is something unacceptable on a movie like this. I wasn't prepared for the excessive violence in this movie and wasn't expecting it.I mean, one thing is a movie being violent if its genre or story justifies so. By this, you accept better its violence, even if it's brutal. But not on something that is supposed to be a fantasy/magical movie suitable for everyone including children. I can handle violence in films (even if it's brutal), as long as it is in an acceptable level and not excessive. But this one was too much for me to handle. There are far too many shocking scenes that I could mention, but I won't go into that. See for yourself and judge for yourself, but be warned: this ain't pretty to view.To tell the truth, only about 10% of the movie has fantasy and even those moments of fantasy have no charm... in fact, they are more dark (in a bad way) than a revelation. This is a strange film. It seems like 3 or 4 completely different films in one, all different in temperament and such. It's a disturbing and very bad movie.The story takes place in Spain in the year 1944, a few years after the Spanish Civil War, during the early Franquist period. The character Captain Vidal is so tyrannical and brutal that he deserves his comeuppance, but his men aren't any better than him.As for the characters that belong to the fantasy part of the movie, I liked the stick insects, the fairies and the mandrake. But the Faun annoyed me. Not only he looked repulsive and was irritating, but also his disturbing intentions about the baby were alarming. The Pale Man was so grotesque and disgusting that words are incapable to describe how much that thing disgusts me.And this movie is as acclaimed as it is? And is considered one of the best foreign movies and even is on Top 250? I'm shocked. I'll never watch this again!",3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Unexpectedly good dark fantasy film,"I just finished watching PAN'S LABYRINTH and it was an unexpectedly good film. At first I was confused because it was in Spanish, I thought my DVR recorded the airing from the Latin channel; but as it turns out, that's the way the film is. If you understand Spanish it should be no big deal, and if you don't understand Spanish don't worry, there are English subtitles.Set in Spain of 1944, a young Ofelia, escapes to a dark fantasy world of The Labyrinth. The set design is spectacular, it's very dark, very Tim Burton like. The creatures of Labyrinth, particularly the old faun, are great. Through the whole film I could not figure out if the faun was sincerely trying to help Ofelia or manipulating her for evil deeds. PAN'S LABYRINTH really reminded me of a dark Chronicles of Narnia film. The cast as a whole gave great performances, but the one who really stood out to me is the performance of Captain Vidal by actor Sergi López. Whenever I tried to anticipate Captain Vidal's next move, he did the complete opposite.Overall, PAN'S LABYRINTH is an entertaining dark fantasy film that will take you on a ride. I was surprised to see that this film is rated R, now I know why. PAN'S LABYRINTH is a dark fantasy film that is NOT FOR CHILDREN, but great for adults.

A Tension-Filled Dark Fantasy,"4 February 2007. In the classic foreign tinge of dark, more sinister fantasy, Pan consumes the audience with darker themes of death. The spacing between fantasy and reality is rather fascinating, though the ultimate issue of reality while blurred somewhat, isn't deliberately pronounced enough to create a true resonance of doubt and wonder. There is one pinnacle scene that appears more manipulative without explanation during the banquet scene. Both overly simple and complex, the special effects are good, the set design engulfing. Unlike Chronicles of Naria (2005), Harry Potter, Jumanji (1995), Lord of the Rings, The Neverending Story, Spirited Away (2002), Time Bandits (1981), Pan has a more wrenching fantastical atmosphere that almost tears the genre apart.

"Great movie, but certainly NOT for the FAINT-HEARTED!","I watched this movie to improve my Spanish (of which I am not a native speaker), and I didn't have English subtitles so I might not have understood each and every word the characters said but I do think it was a fascinating movie and it did help me learn the language. It was a fantastic movie; great plot, great actors, and great direction. That said, I simply cannot give it a perfect 10-star rating just because there were so many scenes that were way too sadistic and gory! This is definitely not a movie you want to show to your kid (it's R-rated just for the violence), and you might consider not watching it yourself if you're a faint-hearted person. The sensitive parts aren't just simple fighting or whatever's shown in the average movie. They're pure savagery! I mean, I guess it'll be fine if you're watching the movie on DVD, but if you don't have the option of skipping or fast-forwarding I really recommend you check the Violence & Gore section of the Parent's Guide before you watch it.The thing about the violent scenes in this movie is that they aren't just implied, they're actually shown to you directly, with all they're ruthlessness and cruelty. Overall, it was a great movie, but I personally did not enjoy the violent scenes, which I am not going to forget anytime soon.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Enchantment and Sorrow,"Guillermo del Toro's ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a dark fairy tale masterpiece that intertwines fantasy and reality with mesmerizing beauty and haunting poignancy. Set against the backdrop of post-Civil War Spain, the film follows young Ofelia, portrayed with innocence and depth by Ivana Baquero, as she navigates a world torn apart by violence and oppression.Del Toro's direction is nothing short of masterful, as he seamlessly weaves together the fantastical elements of Ofelia's imagination with the harsh realities of Francoist Spain. The film's visual style is breathtaking, with its lush cinematography, intricate set designs, and stunning special effects transporting viewers to a world of wonder and terror.Thematically, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" explores the power of imagination as a means of escape and survival in the face of despair. Del Toro deftly juxtaposes the innocence of Ofelia's fairy tale quests with the brutality of the real world, creating a narrative that is as emotionally resonant as it is visually stunning.Central to the film's success is Baquero's poignant portrayal of Ofelia. With her wide-eyed innocence and unwavering determination, Baquero imbues the character with a sense of depth and complexity that belies her young age. She is supported by a talented ensemble cast that includes the likes of Sergi López as the sadistic Captain Vidal and Maribel Verdú as the compassionate housekeeper Mercedes.But perhaps the most compelling character in ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is the mysterious faun, portrayed with otherworldly charm by Doug Jones. As Ofelia's guide through the labyrinthine trials that will determine her fate, the faun embodies both the wonder and the darkness of the fairy tale world, serving as a symbol of hope and redemption in a world consumed by cruelty and despair.In conclusion, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a triumph of storytelling and visual artistry, a film that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll. With its richly drawn characters, spellbinding imagery, and profound thematic depth, it stands as a testament to the power of cinema to transport us to worlds both magical and tragic. A true masterpiece in every sense of the word.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
smells like pan,"Because the film was named ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" I expected something a-maze-ing. This is not what was delivered. Perhaps it is a product of my age, but I have no appetite for superfluous violenceand the film was practically dripping with blood. I did not find the richly imagined fairy tale some reviews had described. The fairy-tale aspects were sparsea shame because of the interesting look of the mythological elements and avenues they could have opened. Del Toro opted to construct both an under-developed war movie and an under-developed fantasy tale, resolving each with transparent cop-outs and plugging holes along the way with murder. I am beginning to suspect the Spanish are a gullible and artless people. Their limp thrusts at profundity bring back memories of a biologically thwarted collaboration of sorts that followed a night of heavy drinking. But fret not, ladies: that was my last night as a Spaniard.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Beautifully realized fairy tale- for adults,"Pan's Labyrinth, or El Laberinto del Fauno, is a film that will amaze you. Both delicate and brutal, del Toro created what he perfectly described as a fairy tale for adults. The film follows Ofelia, stepdaughter to a fascist Spanish Captain, as she uses her imagination to cope with life in the country, in a mill occupied by fascists headed by her stepfather. It also follows the rebels as they try to take the mill. They're very well interwoven, bouncing off each other.In the prologue by del Toro on the Blu Ray (the film looks breathtaking in HD), he tells of how he put much love into making the film, and it's absolutely true. The shots are gorgeous. The lighting notably sets the mood, starting off bright but becoming darker. The sets are grand, especially the fantasy ones. The orchestral score accompanies throughout, quietly affecting your emotions. The visual effects are stunning, and the make-up is scary in some scenes. No corners were cut making this film.Ofelia meets a faun, and is informed she is a princess who must complete 3 tasks to return to her old realm. She meets creatures, which are cool (Faun), gross (toad) and the iconic Pale Man, in the best scene in the film for many reasons. These creatures look wonderful.Other creatures, like Ofelia's stepfather Vidal, are not wonderful. Pan's Labyrinth make look childish, but it is R-Rated. A man's face is effectively destroyed. A leg is severed. Stitches are graphically shown. While not as explicit as shock movies, the contrast with innocent Ofelia makes the violence hard to watch.Lots of thought has been put into Pan's Labyrinth. Themes and motifs are layered deep, and wrapped up in a package of sensitivity. You can interpret it how you like. The ending is bittersweet, and very fitting to the atmosphere and aura of the film.

Panned Labyrinth,"Equal parts Lewis Carroll, Hieronymus Bosch and the Greatest Skits of Martin Scorsese, Guillermo del Toro's lysergic, Franco-era fantasy will entrance those with a taste for gruesome hocus-pocus and leave others unfulfilled by its hybridised riffing on timeworn themes.The story concerns a young girl, Ofelia (played with considerable charm by Ivana Baquero), who is taken by her pregnant mother to a Fascist outpost under the command of Sergi López's brutal Captain  the father of our protagonist's unborn half-sibling. Once in her miserable exile, played out against a backdrop of forest insurgencies by leftist guerrillas, Ofelia soon encounters the titular maze, meeting therein a mysterious faun, Pan, who reveals to her three tasks that might lead to her redemption and rebirth as a princess of his realm.The shadow of Clive Barker hangs brooding over Pan's Labyrinth, which often cranks up the squirm and shock factors in a bid for authentically adult kudos. Del Toro determinedly steers clear of the kind of whimsical escapism virtually patented by Terry Gilliam: for every cutesy fairy, there's a bullet in the head; wherever stardust falls, a bloodied civilian follows suit, grounding the piece in a bedrock of unpleasant reality. This principle of balance works, up to a point. After the second act, it becomes rigidly metronomic.Subtlety in the way of emotional depth is likewise in short supply, as are broader dramaturgical complexities such as motivational or moral explorations in what is a Manichean fable. The Captain, who comes across like Vito Corleone with a migraine, rams home his nastyboots credentials in a series of heavy-handed attacks against all and sundry. Indeed, all the film's central characters are by-the-numbers Good or Bad, two-dimensionally sketched and for the most part thematically sidelined in favour of what are the real attractions here: the inventively grotesque, Narnia-gone-septic monsters in which del Toro obviously delights.Moviegoers with a predilection for Hellraiser et al will find much to enjoy here, as will older Jim Henson fans who have not yet had lunch. But, Pan's Labyrinth is ultimately a meretricious exercise in aesthetic showboating. Though it looks undeniably sumptuous, and its set design is pungently evocative, mythologists and militarists alike may find its themes  of trial and redemption, warfare, loyalty and love (in the latter lies real magic, boys and girls)  unpalatably hackneyed. We've simply been through this looking glass, down this rabbit hole, behind this wardrobe, onto this battlefield and into this chamber of horrors before, and no amount of visual panache can disguise this when it hides in plain sight. Perhaps the only thing truly special about the ""visionary"" del Toro's admittedly handsome mise-en-scène is that he has, in plumping for a magic-realist mish-mash that only partly succeeds in either sense, lucratively overhauled a trite schema, and in so doing moved the risible Blade II down a line on his CV. Pan's Labyrinth, superficially beguiling as it is, is in the end little more than a lovely-ugly Wonderland of face-smashing clichés.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Overrated but something extraordinary,"Pan's Labyrinth is must watch for everyone anyone. It is thrilling, amazing, beautiful and well-worked. It has got extraordinary art direction, cinematography and effects.The thing that lacks in this movie is the script. It feels as if somethings don't fit well like the rebel group and their action relation. May be it was the problem of shifting of vision and mind from fantasizing world back to the usual stuff or may be it was not worked well enough or even may be not filmed properly. It is not really a feel good movie and therefore its script can't be overlooked in its flaws. The acting portion feels to be tried to copy our General SS Han's Landa. But not to forget its a move to enjoy with family and get amazed by its beautiful fantasy- imaginative world.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
"A dark, eerie and magical film","This was the first foreign film I ever watched, I had so many wild thoughts in my mind as to what it would be like. It looked like a mythical tale for children, yet had the violent and bloody overtone of the Spanish Civil War. So I was intrigued by what lay ahead in this movie. I rate my movies in 4 categories; Cinematography, film-making, acting and the overall experience.Cinematography: This one of the best visuals I have ever seen in a movie, the whole movie is enclosed in a dark and eerie tone that looks amazing, everything fits perfectly. Nothing ever looks happy in this film, and that is what brings out the picture. 25/25Film-making: Guillermo del Toro is a brilliant film maker. He's the foreign version of Peter Jackson. His editing is superb, the Pale man and other creatures look absolutely amazing and the setting of this movie is amazing. 25/25Acting: It's hard to rate the acting, because you have to focus on two things. The body language and facial expressions of the actor and how the actor speaks. With the body language I see nothing wrong, but seeing as it is Foreign I can not tell. 25/25Overall Experience: I highly loved this film. It's entertaining, has brilliant visuals, great story and an amazing ending. I recommend you watch this film, right away. 25/25Overall Score: 100/100",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
fantasy does not live here,"Just seen the movie only now out on Swedish screens. What a disappointment. I prepared myself for a beautifully done fantasy movie (judging from the trailers and the awards) and instead... instead I had a few scenes of fantasy in the context of a pseudo-historical Z movie, with trashy violence (that I found completely non functional to the story) and psychologically inconsistent characters. The movie looses tracks so many times you start thinking you are watching something that has not yet gone through a serious cut. Yes, you will notice a lot of post-production, but what about the cohesion and the necessity of the different scenes... do they hold? Ajajaj Gullermo Del Toro... what did you want to do with this movie? Why couldn't you choose a theme? You ended up making a weak hybrid that does not convince either the fans of splatter nor the fans of fantasy movies.Go back to school.",3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Great movie blends fantasy and reality,"What is really great about this movie is its alternating stories. Part of the time it focuses on the army fighting the guerrillas and the other part it focuses on Ophelia trying to prove herself to be worthy of returning to the underground realm. The stories do not intertwine until the ending when even then they do not fully mix. The direction was awesome, knowing when to be mysterious, when to be exciting, and when to be tragic. The music had a creepy and mysterious tone to it, which matched the movies tone. The sets were pretty cool also. My favorite scene from the movie was Ophelia's second trial. It was really suspenseful at first and then intense and scary. I thought the pale creature's design was brilliant. The only things I thought could be improved on were that Ophelia isn't a very interesting character as she is not meant to be much more than an innocent, imaginative kid, and that I wished the story would focus a bit more on the fantasy part which I found to be more interesting than the realistic part. This is a must see if you like dark fantasy movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
One of the best fantasy movies.,"This is my first review ever so this may sound a bit crappy.First of all I want to say that this movie is excellent and that everyone who loves fantasy movies should definitely watch this film.The story is very fascinating. It takes place during the Spanish civil war. I think this is very nicely done since it blends a child's imagination with a very real war.I was surprised by the amount of violence because at first I thought this was a movie for children. Make no mistake, this is not a movie for young children.The acting work is good and convincing. The innocence of Ofelia the main character and the evil of her stepfather Captain Vidal is a very big contrast which shows the difference between fantasy and reality.The costumes and sets are amazing. It really looks like they spend a lot of time and care about how the characters look like. No overuse of computer animated effects.If you want to see a good and original fantasy story I really urge you to watch this movie.This film proves that foreign movies can easily match the expensive Hollywood ones.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
A visual feast for the eye and food for thought,"Weaving a fairy tale into a harsh war environment, combining historical drama, fantasy elements and horror and make everything work when it is played against each other is not an easy task. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" works. Mexican director Guillermo del Toro tells a little girl's story in fascist Spain of 1944, and it is full with mythology, symbols, lush colors, jaw dropping scenery, dreamlike music and lots of imagination. Coming from his heart, conceived years before he finally could commit it to celluloid, del Toro knows what strings to pull in the film which he also authored. As a director he prefers real sets, miniature shots and actors over CGI, and while the latter has its part as well, it is more a supportive role in order to tell the tale. Said tale is far more than the traditional good versus evil, it's about contrasts and the collision of worlds for sure, but also about choices within and outside realities if you will, about convictions and truths only found in one's self.In a way ""Pan's Labyrinth"" has a lot to do with Terry Gilliam's absurd fantasy retro-sci-fi film ""Brazil"" or even ""Tideland"", though it differs distinctly in style from these examples. And like Gilliam's pictures ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is like a breath of fresh air for those who want to get out more of fantasy than the common orc bashing. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a fairy tale and tragic reality at the same time, a visual feast for the eye and food for thought, filmed poetry to be enjoyed and appreciated more with every viewing. If you like intelligent fantasy, this is your thing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
Truly Wonderful Film,"I had the pleasure of watching this the night after having to sit through the latest Hollywood blockbuster the evening before.Boy, this movie restored my faith in films. A film that really builds it's characters, has actors who really can act, and a story that is wondrous and chilling at the same time.All the way through the movie you are jolted from fantasy to the harshest realities and at the end you are given the choice as to what you believe.The movie keeps you guessing at the Fawn's motives all the way to the end and you are never sure what will happen next.A movie I recommend to everybody, especially those who have had enough of over-hyped flimsy story lines.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
"serious and sad, but  hopeful and abstract","The movie had a diverse range of emotions and action. There was brutality and fierceness, but also love and innocence. There was a serious world of war and death, but also a world of magic and hope. One of the magical scenes reminded me of Silent Hill, but this is not a pure horror movie.Sound effects are very blatant. The creature creak loudly as if they were extremely inflexible. The movie is somewhat violent, but this is not an action movie. The gunshots are unrealistic. The bullets leave small holes and often no blood.Worth seeing for a serious and sad, but abstract view of the world from a young girls eyes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
"A Visual and Imaginative ""Fairy Tale for Adults""","I first heard about Pan's Labyrinth a few months ago, and wanted to see it ever since. Everyone kept on saying it was a fantastic film, and within the Top Ten movies of this past year. So, when this film finally came to the theaters in my area, I quickly jumped at the chance to watch it. I must say that it has to be one of my all time favorite films.First, the visuals and computer graphics were awe-inspiring. Second, the script was flawless, although some people will, of course, figure out some minor mistakes. The ensemble cast was incredible.This film takes the viewer on a journey through Post-Civil War Spain, and the fantasy world Ofelia discovers. Once one reaches the, quite shocking, conclusion, one cannot help but feel so many emotions at the same time, never has a movie done that to me before. Each scene of this movie is vital to the plot, and the characters are more than believable. Watch this movie, and enter the mesmerizing world of Pan's Labyrinth.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
A-Maze-ing,"I'm not sure why it's called Pan's Labyrinth in the English translation because I'm fairly sure that the Faun never refers to himself by name or is referred to by name throughout the running time but the real mystery surrounding Del Toro's fantasy is why is engages in the cinema, stays with you afterwards but still leaves you cold.Its certainly not for want of creative energy. This is a rich and unusual enterprise, occasionally hauntingly beautiful, a bit like the corpse of a stunning 20 year old who's died from electrocution and lies tantalisingly inert on the mortician's slab. Obsentisably its a Spanish civil war drama with a liberal sprinkling of fairy dust, horrific in its real world setting, baroque and artistic in Ofelia's fantasy realm. But Pan's Labyrinth has problems beneath its carefully layered visuals. The two halves marry successfully but to no real end. The opening scenes promise a more substantial payoff but instead its a fascinating but ultimately hollow piece about childhood escapism. That the fantasy is real as the narrative suggests hardly matters in the end as its had such a negligible impact on the non-magical world.Alluring, well made and often captivating, you should see it, just know that the real magic is that you won't notice the lack of dramatic integrity until its all over...but you will notice.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy"
