One of the most memorable holiday classics of all time. A visual masterpiece. ***1/2 out of ****.,"THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS / (1993) ***1/2Starring the voices of: Danny Elfman, Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara, Ken Page, Ed Ivory, and William Hickey Directed by Henry Celiac. Written by Michael McDowell. Running time: 76 minutes. Rated PG (for horrific images and some animated violence).Tim Burton seems like the only being on the planet who could come with characters such as the ones found in ""The Nightmare Before Christmas."" The feature is literally a tale likely to be found in a child's dreams. It creates a world of its own, inhabiting unforgettable characters and events that should be shared with generations. This film is a visual masterpiece; a movie that deserves to be a holiday favorite for some time to come.The atmosphere director Henry Celiac captures in ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is truly breathtaking. The cities and setting in which these characters live are visually perplexing, yet descriptive and develop the production's mood perfectly. We, as audiences starving for originality and imagination, are able to enter a scope so believable and unrelentingly convincing we lust for every last minute of it.The movie's protagonist is Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king of the holiday town of Halloween. Jack is the role model for much of the cities population. The only problem is that Jack has been around for ages, parked in a town where every single year builds up for a conventional holiday, Halloween. This character has grown depressed and saddened by the routine living style he inhabits. We learn of his passion for new events and a and new life through a musical number that is both effective and engaging.Later on that vary night, Jack wonders off into a nearby woods and stumbles upon an area surrounded with magical doors leading to specific holiday worlds. Jack, blooming with curiosity, enters Christmas town: a joyful, happy place with snow, glitter, children singing, and colorful lights decorating the village in its entirety. Jack is mystified by the glamorous atmosphere, and rushes home to tell the Town of Halloween about his adventures.We realize the internalconflict is Jack's boredom of routine. This becomes more complex when he tries to figure out the meaning of Christmas. The external problem comes later in the plot, where we predict an uneasy disaster upcoming due to his intentions of recreating Christmas in Halloween style.Other key characters are Sally, the puppet-like creation of an angry professor, the city's Mayor who has a head for both his good and bad personality, the Oggie Boogie, the film's villain who is everything we ever dreamed of regarding a diabolical animated bad guy, and the inevitable character of Santa Clause.""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is not necessarily a children's movie, it might be too strange or fanatical for the very young. It is certainly a musical production, and at times, I felt that the songs replaced essential development. However, the musical numbers are challenging and memorable, containing passion and emotion. The picture is a walk into the mind of some of the most wildly imaginative filmmakers of our time. ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is titled wonderfully, although the film is truly not a nightmare, but a dream--a dream brought to life on the big screen.Brought to you by Touchstone Pictures.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Finally Decided to Watch It,"This is certainly a pleasant surprise. Tim Burton, purveyor of the wacko, has created, along with his amazing team, a real classic work. Seldom does a film bank on so much originality, from the incredible creation of Halloween Town, with its denizens, marvelous in their diversity and variety, to a really interesting plot. The character of Jack Skellington is a scene-stealer. Considering he pretty much a stick with a round, skeletal head, he has amazing expression and energy. He is an artist and a rebel, dissatisfied with the continuing shortsightedness of his frightening peers. When his world opens up through an accidental fall into another town, paralleling his own, he tries to bring Christmas back with him. The problem is that he really doesn't understand the concept well enough. He mixes his own social foundation with an alien one and the results are hilarious. Wonderful to look at with some of the finest animation you will ever see, each moment carefully scripted and produced.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Artfully combines two very different holidays,"Who would ever think that a musical about the overlap between Halloween and Christmas would work? However, it does work with the songs not exactly being Christmas - or Halloween - classics, but fitting the dark mood of this film perfectly.The movie opens with Jack Skellington, AKA the Pumpkin King, facing an identity crisis of sorts. Halloween has just ended in his hometown of Halloween Town, and he has been receiving kudos from everyone in town for making this year's Halloween the scariest ever. But Jack is seeking purpose in his life, and scaring people to death once a year just isn't doing it for him anymore. He takes a walk in the woods and he discovers a group of trees each with doors and different symbols on each door. He opens the door with the tree symbol on it, and finds himself in Christmas Town. While there, he is fascinated by the contrast of Christmas Town with his own world. Jack returns home, along with a sampling of trinkets from Christmas Town, to contemplate the meaning of what he has found there. Ultimately he decides that this year, Halloween Town is going to take charge of Christmas. Jack has also decided that he will replace ""Sandy Claws"" on his yearly sleigh ride, delivering presents to all of the children of the world. All of the citizens of Halloween Town are enthused by the idea except Sally, a creation of Halloween Town's mad scientist, who coincidentally is also looking for something new in her life. She alone sees the danger of Halloween Town hijacking the Christmas holiday.While the Grinch tried to destroy Christmas and came away with a true understanding of the meaning of the holiday, Jack Skellington, with the best of intentions, is on the road to ruin Christmas. In preparation for the big event, he enlists the townspeople to help make toys, and they just can't get the hang of making or doing anything that is not designed to terrify. In fact, when Jack makes his Christmas ride and the town hears on the radio of the terror Jack is causing, they actually see this as a sign of success. To them, horror equals happiness.Like most good films designed for all age groups, the movie is actually weaving a tale on two levels. The story itself is very straightforward so that children can easily follow it. On a second level, there is deft humor and one-liners that are obviously aimed at adults, such as the mayor's plea to Jack -""I'm only an elected official here! I can't make decisions!"" Or when the scientist who created Sally gets tired of her running away and builds a new creation to replace her. This one turns out to be just a female version of the mad scientist himself to which he has endowed half of his own brain. His conclusion is ""You will be a decided improvement over that treacherous Sally. We'll have conversations worth having."" You'll see quite a bit of similarity between the style of art design here and that done in some of Tim Burton's other films, such as ""Beetlejuice"". You'll also probably recognize Danny Elfman's style of score that has come to decorate so many of Burton's other films. I highly recommend this film as great entertainment for the whole family.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Wonderfully imaginative animation, fun & intelligent songs make for a great family film for all but the youngest children","Jack Skellington is the Pumpkin King Â– the creative genius behind the holiday of Halloween, designing each year to be scarier and more horrible than the one before. However deep inside he longs for more than the horror and scares of Halloween Town, a longing he cannot understand until he stumbles into Christmas Town and sees happiness and cheer the likes of which has evaded him all these years. Having finally worked out what Christmas is all about, Jack decides to kidnap Santa and make himself the new king of Christmas Town so that he can have the happiness of Christmas all the time. But the others in the towns realize the significant consequences that this disruption of the norm will have as Jack's evil nature proves harder to overcome than he thought.With Pixar currently dominating the world of 'animations that please both children and adults' it is easy to forget that over a decade ago Tim Burton delivered this delightful family film to the cinema using a much more traditional animation and a huge amount of imagination. The basic plot is a great little fantasy fairytale with a very dark heart to it that make it much more enjoyable for having that edge. Too often kids films (especially at the time and animated) are soaked in a sweet sentiment that simply forgets that kids are not stupid and indeed often prefer a bit of darkness in the story. The only downside of this darkness is that younger children might not 'get it' and just end up being scared by the Halloween images and imaginative images. Despite this the material will play equally well to adults and children because it neither panders to nor excludes one group over the other at any time. Regardless of the material, the film still manages to come off as charming and enjoyable thanks to a well-written script that never plays for the basic laugh or easy sentiment. Some viewers may come to this with Pixar in their minds and bemoan it for not being hilariously funny from start to finish, but they are missing the point andThe songs reflect this approach and are very clever throughout; whether it is the sorrowful longing of Jack at the start or the Cab Calloway-inspired song from Oogie Boogie Man, generally they are inventive and fun. The same praise can be laid at the door of the stop-motion animation, which is inventive and fun to look at from start to finish. All the characters have a great deal of effort put in and they add to the dark feel of the film. The voice cast may not feature a load of well-known voices in the same way as Pixar films generally do, but they still do a great job. Sarandon and Elfman combine to do a good job with Jack; Page is fun as Oogie Boogie; O'Hara is good as Sally despite not having as fun a character to work with but for my money it is Hickey (as Dr Finklestein) and Shadix (Mayor) that make the biggest impression, mainly due to having the most enjoyable characters.Overall this is a very short but very enjoyable film that will please both children and adults at the same time (with the same material) and never ignores or panders to one side of the audience over the other. Both groups will appreciate the dark fairytale, the clever songs, the darkly imaginative animation and the comic sense of humour, making this a family film that deserves to be remembered even as kids movie get smarter and fancier.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Burton's ""Nightmare"" is a dream come true","By 1993, director Tim Burton was such a successful filmmaker in Hollywood that he was able to return to one of his most beloved early projects, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas."" It's certainly an inspired movie, as it is also very weird, and when I say ""weird,"" I mean it's distinctly Burton.Even though it was directed with enough competency by Henry Selick, this groundbreaking stop-motion animation film is Burton all the way, as it contains ample ""esque"" qualities that make this ""Nightmare"" uniquely his vision.As the film opens in the twisted, ""Burton""-esque village of ""Halloweentown,"" Jack Skellington, who is dually voiced by Chris Sarandon and longtime Burton collaborator Danny Elfman, is celebrating another ""horrible"" Halloween. You'll be shocked and amazed at some of the town's inhabitants, who include jazz-playing zombies, Four Tenor-like vampires, a wolf man, and a wheelchair-bound scientist who occasionally opens up his cranium to (literally) scratch his brain; his creation, a Frankenstein-like scarecrow named Sally (Catherine O'Hara), yearns for contact with others and is quite fond of Jack Skellington.But Jack's quickly growing tired of the same old routine year after year, and because he's so downtrodden with boredom, he ventures into the dark forest outside the town's borders, and accidentally stumbles onto the wondrous, jolly world of ""Christmastown."" Enticed by its splendor, he decides to bring back his discovery to the residents of Halloweentown, who of which are just as shocked by Christmas as he is. Jack gets the brilliant idea to pose as Santa Claus but hires three mischief-makers to kidnap the real Santa so he can share his own, misguided vision of Christmas with an unprepared world.Painstakingly and meticulously crafted, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a beautiful and wonderful film from start to finish. The most famous image of this film is the cover art, which features Skellington eerily silhouetted against a full moon while he stands atop a coiled hill that overlooks a desolate graveyard.Burton is such a wonderful director, who had already brought us one unique ""esque"" vision after the other, especially with the first two ""Batman"" films and ""Edward Scissorhands"" behind him as of '93 when ""Nightmare"" was made.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"One of the best films of 1993, highly re-watchable","I was a kid when I first saw Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas, but I wasn't scared by it in the slightest - this world is one entirely of the imagination, and in a sense saying that the film is scary for younger children is something of a compliment.  'Nightmare' is both a horror film and a musical, and fantasy and a suspense film, and like most Burton effort, comedy is thrown in at just the right moments.With Henry Selick as director and Michael McDowell & Caroline Thompson as the screenwriters, Burton has fashioned the worlds of Halloween-town and Christmas-town as real originals, working on the cliches that are in each holiday and surrounding the worlds with a host of terrific and terrifying characters.  While Halloween-town has a mayor (appropriately with two faces, one smiling one distressed), the real leader is Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon voices with a great Danny Elfman as the singing Jack) who orchestrates Halloween every year for its citizens.  But he's grown weary over the years, and after stumbling upon Christmas-town, loaded with good will towards men and a large man in a red suit, he gets his town riled up to overtake the joyous holiday.  Despite one protest by Sally (an amazing Catherine O'Hara), the doll-girl who loves him, the town goes on creating Jack's vision.  The results are hilarious and, indeed, spellbinding.Much credit is given to Burton and Selick for their work on the film, but a lot should also be attributed to Denise Di Novi (co-producer and co-designer), Rick Heinrichs (visual consultant), Pete Kozachik (D.P.), and of course Danny Elfman for his perfectly fitting score and song creations. Along with the talented voice actors, Nightmare Before Christmas ends up a triumph of artistic ingenuity.  Some could construe it as too weird or too stylish, but for the cult audience it has garnered over the past ten years it remains of of Burton's finest accomplishments.

A true must see for all Halloween fans,"I am not a big Tim Burton fan, but this movie is in my top 3 of all time. Perhaps the fact that Halloween is my favorite holiday influenced my opinion, but I doubt it. The more I hear and read about this movie, the more I love it.Based on a parody of the famous ""Night before Christmas"" poem by Moore that Burton wrote and illustrated while employed at Disney, this idea was stagnant for many years prior to filming. In many ways this was a good thing, technology was able to catch up to Burton's ideas.In NBC, we see our hero Jack Skellington, aka The Pumpkin King, depressed as another Halloween passes. In the background we hear the residents of Halloween Town celebrate another wonderful holiday. But Jack is sad. The only one who notices is the Rag Doll-style woman Sally.Other characters, including many town-monsters, are introduced. We meet the wonderful mayor with two faces, the evil scientist and his assistant, three local children and our evil boogie-man.After an accident, Jack develops a plan to kidnap ""Sandy Claws"" and give presents out for Christmas in place of Christmas Town. You will have to view this movie to discover the rest.The claymation is not what I expected, it was of a high quality and the movements are not jerky like the old Christmas Specials. Danny Elfman's music has little resemblance to his work with Ongo Bongo and ""What's this?"" (which Jack sings when he discovers the colorful world of Christmas Town) is closer to a tune mixed from Cabaret and The Music Man. The voices match the mouth movements nearly perfectly. This was a project from the heart and all the little touches to make it 'just' right show this fact.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Superb Gothic animation with a thin plot,"Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas is a visually spectacular tour de force of Gothic styles and themes, bound around a simple children's tale. The story follows Jack Skellington, the king of Halloween Town, who one day while walking in the woods stumbles upon Christmas Town; a town where, you guessed it, every day is Christmas. Jack doesn't quite understand the concept of a celebration where nobody is frightened or killed, but he decides to have the celebration in his town regardless. While plotting, he also decides to kidnap Santa and deliver Christmas Town's gifts himself this year...much to the dismay of the local children, who aren't too pleased about receiving the gifts that a skeleton from Halloween Town brings them...This movie was actually directed by Henry Sellick, but it is obviously Tim Burton's film. His style is rampant throughout the film, and it is clear that this could only have come from his mind. The animation on display here is magnificent; the style is very unique and it blends very well with the Gothic theme. Where the film falls down, however, is on the story side and, more notably, the delivery of the story. The story is very linear; I understand that this film is predominantly aimed at children, but even children's films can be more expansive than this; the film also really should be more expansive as Tim Burton has created a whole world with many unique and interesting characters, yet only a handful are allowed to shine. Burton (and his composer, Elfman) seem far too keen to pack the movie with songs. I have no problem with this, but the songs here are really rather dull. The majority of them have little more than one or two lines that are sung over and over and considering that the film is packed with these songs; it gets old fast and more dialogue would have worked better.Overall, Nightmare Before Christmas is a nice film. The animation and style are amazing and it has lots of nice moments; but it is let down by a thin story and poor delivery. Horror fans will have fun spotting the tributes, and I don't doubt that many children will love this film, as will many adults; but it could and really should have been a lot better, and I have to say that it left me cold.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Textbook example proving the old adage, ""The grass is always greener in someone else's yard.""","This film, while far from Burton's masterpiece, is a delightful musical that in the end shows that, sometimes, we have things far better than we think we do and the other side of the fence sometimes looks better just because it's different, but that doesn't make necessarily wise to pursue someone else's dream because we mistakenly think we may like it more.  Tim Burton's fingerprints are all over this film.  Excellent casting of vocal talent, the score is great and the animation is marvelous.  A very good film and worth watching more than once.

A great achievement but could had been way more entertaining.,"""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a perfectly professionally made movie with almost flawless looking stop-motion animation. However as entertainment this movie is flawed, due to its simple story and a pace that is a bit too fast for the movie.""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" has some highly fun and amusing characters in it and that also is the strongest thing of the movie. Jack Skellington is a nice and memorable main character but it is the Mayor that mostly steals the show in this movie. The movie is filled with tons of odd looking- and acting monstrous characters. Oogie Boogie is a cool villain but he unfortunately doesn't get an awful lot to do in this movie. The characters are fun but the movie itself isn't halve as much as fun. There are just a few laughs in it and in general the movie is simply too short. Because the movie is so short all of the scene's come and go too fast after each other. The story is told too fast and because of that things aren't always build up nicely or correctly. Because of this there also are some plot holes in the movie. The movie should had been maybe at least 10-15 minutes longer. It makes ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" a bit of a movie that is most certainly not bad but has many missed opportunities in it.Even though the movie isn't directed by Tim Burton himself, it still has 'Tim Burton' written all over it. The visual style and characters are definitely Burton material. There is plenty to enjoy for his fans, in this movie. The music and songs by Danny Elfman are also what gives this movie a 'Burton' kind of feeling and atmosphere. The music by Elfman is good and the songs, even though no Oscar material, are enjoyable and quite memorable as well.It certainly is a professionally made and good looking movie but the story could had used some more work and the movie should had been longer, to build up the scene's and characters better. It still is an enjoyable movie to watch but it could and should had been way more entertaining.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
An animated classic? I think so!,"I admit it, I really like Tim Burton. I know his films are very oddball, but he has a wide imagination and his films are visually amazing. And I like a vast majority of his films, Edward Scissorhands being my personal favourite, and I love Batman and Batman Returns too. Henry Sellick is also promising, from the likes of James and the Giant Peach and Coraline. The Nightmare Before Christmas is a brilliant film. Is it an animated classic. Yes I think it is! It is wonderfully weird yet lots of fun as well. Visually and technically, the film looks absolutely amazing, with wonderful Gothic backgrounds and detailed colouring. Skellington silhouetted against the moonlight is quite possibly the film's most haunting image. The story is great, about Jack Skellington discovering ChristmasTown but doesn't understand the concept so he kidnaps Santa Claus. And the characters are endearing and weird, ranging from jazz playing zombies, Four-tenor like vampires to a wolf man. Then we have the title characters, Jack Skellington is a wonderful protagonist, really interesting to say the least. And Sally for an inventor's creation is very beautiful. The songs from Danny Elfman(the fact that he didn't get an award for his score for Edward Scissorhands is the biggest music snubs ever) are great fun, haunting, funny, clever and intelligent. The voice acting is top notch, Chris Sarandon does a great job as the speaking voice of Skellington, and Danny Elfman himself provides the singing voice superbly. Catherine O'Hara is sweet and innocent, and Ken Page(the voice of King Gator in All Dogs Go To Heaven) is a hoot as Oogie Boogie. All in all, weird, but visually stunning, funny and intelligent animated movie. A definite classic! 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Great Visuals Shadowed by Poor Storytelling,"The Nightmare Before Christmas follows Jack Skellington, a skeleton leading Halloween town who, after having another successful Hallowe'en, discovers Christmas and becomes obsessed with introducing the holiday into his world.The visuals are, to be expected, great. It's a creepy Tim Burton clay-mation movie, what do you expect? The way in which it is done screams the 90s, but despite it's age it holds up very well regardless.The soundtrack is a lot of fun, specifically the opening song. The rest of the songs are worked into the movie very well, and I never dreaded listening to any of them when they did come up. Furthermore, they actually contributed to the story in most cases, so I had to listen anywayHowever, without the visuals this would be a very poor movie. The writing is unnatural a lot of the time, and it features an incredibly forced, out-of-nowhere ending scene. On top of that, there are several points throughout the movie where certain events happen for no reason. Jack and other characters know things they never had the opportunity to learn. Sure, we as the audience can piece together that they went to some other character and figured it out, but because that is never shown and it is somewhat important that they do because of how it will affect the story, I have to assume that they didn't happen and that the writers just didn't know what to do because they were running out of time.Despite this, I more or less enjoyed the movie. I wouldn't say it's good, but it's worth a watch. I'll probably never see it again, and in the end I wouldn't really recommend it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Visually inventive, but not my thing","I think a lot of the enjoyment of this movie comes down to what you think of the animation. Watching it now versus watching it in 1993 makes a big difference. I wasn't a huge fan of the animation, making it harder to get into the story. And I found the story a little lacking. Was Jack Skellington trying to ruin Christmas or did he really enjoy it and just accidentally mess it up? I think the script could have used a little work. That said, I did enjoy the music, and have been singing ""What's this? What's this?"" for the last day. Is this is Christmas movie or a Halloween movie? I can see both sides of the debate.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Wonderful movie!,"This movie has always been a favorite of mine. I never like holiday movies, because i always find them to be full to bursting with slapstick comedy, or way too sugary-sweet and dramatic. both of these things are okay in moderation, but most Christmas movies seem to go to one side of the spectrum or the other. this wonderful fairy tale is perfect for someone like me, who likes a little bit of a darker movie, but expects a Christmas movie to have a good message. the darkness in the movie is not without cause-it shows the joy of Christmas in great contrast to the scariness of Halloween, and it made me love both holidays all the more for that reason. i don't know, maybe that's just because Halloween and Christmas are my favorite holidays, but i really feel that this movie is great for older children and adults. younger children (up to 5 or 6 years) may find this simply frightening, but older children would find it wonderful.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Beautiful and weird,"Artistically speaking, this is a beautiful film with incredible stop motion camera-work AND a really stylish atmosphere. The characters are really captivating and just plain ""cool"". Halloween Town is also a visual delight. In almost every way I consider this a wonderful film. However, for people like me who are not particularly enamored with musicals, the music is definitely the low-point. It's not that the songs are bad, but that there are so many of them. The dialog is mostly sung and I found it detracted, slightly, from my viewing experience. However, considering that almost all the high school students I teach LOVE this movie, I certainly seem to have the minority opinion. So, for those who are not into musicals, still watch it--you'll enjoy it. But, like me you may also wish they'd done a few less numbers! PS--On the DVD, you also get FRANKENWEENIE (a half hour short) and VINCENT (also a short and the seeming inspiration for NBC). They make this a MUST-HAVE DVD.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A True Tim Burton Film,"I was five years old when I saw this movie and after that the words Tim Burton rang in my ears as one of Hollywood's most eccentric directors. Whenever I hear that a Tim Burton film is coming out I think of The Nightmare Before Christmas and how wonderful it is. The story is very original, the scenery is wonderfully Gothic and the characters and animation is to scream for.Another thing about this film are the songs. They're so twisted and funny that I can't help but hum, whistle or just sing them word by word and musical note by musical note.So in conclusion, The Nightmare Before Christmas is what you would get if you were to put the minds of Edgar Allen Poe and Dr. Seuss in a blender. You get a beautifully dark and wildly bizarre film about Santa Claus, dancing skeletons and what goes bump in the night.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"Sympathetic, fun though macabre movie relying on a wonderful painstaking stop-motion technique","Very amusing and well made stop-motion animation film, competently realized by Henry Selick and financed by Tim Burton . It revolves around Jack Skellington, the sympathetic Mayor , he is the unlikely pumpkin King of the dangerously weird city of Halloweentown. He is boring of the same old routine of making people scream every Octuber 13 and to the dismay of the fellow monsters who inhabite the town. Boring with his annual Halloween he sets out to encounter something better and accidentally discovers the happy Christmas town whose goings-on so enchant him and for envy, he then has a phenomenal idea : to stand in for Santa this Christmas. It results in his decision to abduct Santa with unexpected consequences. As the demons trick or treaters : Lock, Stock and Barrel take Santa, but this one eventually goes to Boogey Man. Then Jack Skeffington along with his spooky friends determine to take over the work of the head honcho there, one Santa Claws. Jack riding on reindeers skeletons goes to Christmas town giving surprising, eerie and creepy gifts to children.This is a fun, entertaining and ingenious stuff with some creepy touches, magic as well as funny elements, but ponderously paced in keeping with rather rousing musical score. An original fairy tale with an amazing screenplay by Caroline Thompson from roles and story created by Tim Burton. It took more than two years to shot with a perfect technique by means of stop-motion. Not cuddly, best appreciated by those with a feel for the sinister. Fast paced is maintained throughout by the equally breathless, lively soundtrack masterfully composed by the great musician Danny Elffman who sings some sings, too . Including known voices Catherine O'hara, Chris Sarandon, Paul Reubens, William Hickey, and Danny Elffman himself. It is a really amusing film that kiddies and adults with a sense of the bizarre enjoy very much.The picture was financed by Tim Burton who was an animator trainee at Walt Disney productions. Burton came up with his adventurous idea but could not get it made, subsequent directorial hits brought more clout. Burton also produced or directed other fims in similar style as Frankenweenie and Corpse Bride. Burton hired Henry Selick who made a very competent direction who equally directed Monkeybone, Caromine and James and the giant peach.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
I don't understand what the fuss is about.,"Right, I've seen all these other teenagers wandering around, wearing hoodies with Jack's face on, all crying out ""OMG the nitemare be4 Xmas is soooooooo awesome"", so I decided to see it for myself. I wanted to know what the fuss was about. I mean, if loads of people like something, it's got to be good, right? .....Right? Less than 3 minutes into the film, I was sitting there thinking ""So...People think this is the best animated film ever?"" I was struck instantly by the animation. It's dire. So amateurish. I've seen cartoons done by first-year animation students and they are sensational compared to the animation in this film. The animation is 'sticky', usually far too slow (especially with 'shock' reactions), and it's just... argh. It bugged me so much. I'm sure there are going to be people who either think ""What are you talking about?"" (to them I say: Watch it again and bear this in mind) or ""Oh, don't be mean. Stop-motion is very hard and they must be applauded for their efforts"" (to them I say: No it's not. I've got loads of experience with stop-motion. It's simple if you know what you're doing). Sure, the models are fine, no, the models are great, it's just that they didn't do a very good job of giving them 'life'.Now I shall discuss my views of the plot. I must admit, I didn't pay as much attention to the film as many fans would have, but there was something that confused me greatly (among other things, but this one just plain annoys me). Sally is, effectually, the doctor's slave, and is never allowed to be away from the doctor (and is often locked up) so she doesn't get a good taste of the 'outside world', and yet she evidently had managed to develop a good friendship with Jack before the film's setting.Wait, what? Is that just bad script-writing, or am I simply not seeing the apparent obvious? I don't quite understand how someone can be emotionally separated from the rest of the community, yet manage to maintain a friendship with one of its members.Other than that *ahem* possible inconsistency, the idea of the plot is very good. It is very imaginative. I don't have any problems with it. This film, as we all know, is also a musical. Now, normally with musicals I sit there thinking ""Oh God, there's another song coming up"", but with this film, I found the songs tolerable; they became part of the film and, quite simply, the film almost survives on these songs. As for the voice acting, that was also very good, and the actors must be praised for making a decent job of it.In conclusion, good story, maybe, but great cartoon? I don't think so. There's certainly nothing about it to make me feel like going around saying it's the best cartoon/animated film ever. There are dozens of things I can think of which would have made this film better, and admittedly I find it such a shame that my opinions of the film have been made so negative by this fact.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

This is precisely the questioning of the protagonist of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"".Considered the ultimate celebrity of his city, Jack Skellington (played by Chris Sarandon, from the series ""Orange is the New Black"", and Danny Elfman, composer of ""The Simpsons"" and ""Justice League"", among others) is one of the organizers of Halloween. Every year he and the ambiguous Mayor (Glenn Shadix, ""The Ghosts Have Fun"") organize the festive plight the locals so love, spreading the dark spirit around the world. But Jack is in one of those phases of life where everyone questions themselves. On a walk in search of what may be his epiphany, he discovers a peculiar colored door: green, shaped like a tree, with colorful acorns and a star at its tip. Jack discovers Christmas Town.When we think of horror aimed at children, The Nightmare Before Christmas is the first work we imagine, always associated with the name of Tim Burton. Despite not being exactly a horror movie, we have, in the creation of this universe, a fantastic gothic feeling that assimilates many of the worst nightmares that children have, without ever causing repulsion, but without being easily digestible by them. For the kids Jack's Strange World frightens as much as it delights, allowing the tape to be an unforgettable milestone in their childhood. The name of Tim Burton, producer of the film, although not related to the direction, the responsibility of Henry Sellick, remains quite highlighted and in a fair way, as he has credit for the creation of the story and the world, with an aesthetic signature clearly his own. . Most interesting of all, in a behind-the-scenes thought, is the information that the film was produced by Skellington Productions, in a joint venture with Disney Studios. The reality is that, on second thought, it would be extremely complicated for a work with a villain composed of disgusting insects and worms to be directly linked to Disney, which is very different from the company. The creativity of Sellick and Burton, at least, is free from any ties, ready to give rise to a remarkable musical work, with peculiar and extraordinary characteristics in several of the areas in which we can analyze the work.The construction of the world, above all, is one of the great initial successes of the filmmakers. The stop-motion technique, while in other cases it would be an ally for image creation, here it is the basis for what is manufactured in terms of the universe. No wonder that Tim Burton and Henry Sellick would be involved in other animations with this style, such as The Corpse Bride and Coraline and the Secret World. Stop-motion is ""weird"" in itself, deforming nature in a way that doesn't make it rejectable, but extremely special, not to mention charming. Skeleton Jack's Strange World (Chris Sarandon) is an impressive visual composition, giving rise to a stunning contrast when, later, we see the work's protagonist, saddened, discover another universe, and, consequently, discover Christmas. We're talking about a scrawny being, contradicting himself when his posture is so elegant, but his ability to be terrifying is revealed later as he converses with some demonic children in his world.We are so used to thinking of terror, haunting or dark as elements aimed at an adult audience that we forget, or deny the fact that children can also feel fear and, in many cases, like that of little Izabel who discovered a new world to her. Coming across a film about a talking skeleton, much more than frightening or terrifying, ended up highlighting a universe where the different is also appreciated and does not cause any surprise or discomfort, but it becomes loved. Along with very few other examples of animations with details characteristic of horror, The Nightmare Before Christmas integrates small lessons and messages to a film whose visual aspect enchants and surprises precisely because we are so used to accompanying enchanted princesses or inanimate objects coming to life. Here, good intentions can lead to chaos, but knowing we made mistakes is part of the trajectory, and repairing our mistakes becomes even more important than admitting that we made mistakes. It's what we do with our mistakes that counts and, no one can deny that Jack, while creating the greatest chaos that Christmas has ever seen, was sincere and humble enough to look for a way to repair his mistake.Tim Burton's story, at first glance, is not intended to reflect on the breaking of stereotypes, although, in the path he decides to navigate, it begins a subversive thought, in which a monster is capable, as well as any person, of fall in love with a festivity that you didn't know before. The doors are theoretically open for exploring the new. We actually have, despite this anti-conservative surface, a split with thoughts of social integration. Each little world in this created universe is far from the other, reaching the point where the union between two different ones, Halloween and Christmas, causes chaos and not harmony. The onslaught is somewhat tragic, whereas Skeleton Jack fails to translate Christmas into the creatures of Halloween City, failing to be the character Santa Claus (Ed Ivory) who ultimately fixes the mistakes made by the protagonist. Tim Burton's cinema is, in a way, excluding, but not with a malice, arising, however, from a more saddened and pessimistic view of reality. By being seen as different, Tim Burton ends up looking at his own characters, sort of versions of himself, like Edward Scissorhands, and putting them apart from society, which cannot, even at the end of the story, accept them. Children, for example, completely reject Jack's gifts in Strange World.As good a fable as it is, this film takes us to Jack's questions when he finds himself creatively exhausted. On the other hand, we follow the rag doll Sally (Catherine O'Hara, ""Frankenweenie""), whose curiosity complements what the Christmas spirit means so that it never becomes repetitive: a little creativity here; a bit of curiosity over there.But the big difference is in the direction of Henry Selick (""Coraline""), who takes us from Halloween City to Christmas City, composing characteristics of the characters, which are intertwined in the feelings of scary and cuteness. In this story, the stranger not only doesn't fit, but allows himself to be many things. But the central issue in this permissiveness is the problem of putting it above all in favor of self-acceptance. The protagonist Jack has a crisis with Halloween because he should accept himself and so he could also love himself and also be able to love. Soon the character Sally has her narrative counterpoint parallel with her visions, being oppressed by the scientist who created her, in her capacity to self-destruct and build, apart from empathic understanding. She is the symbol of love that the screenwriter is so fond of, as can be seen in the writer's work in the film ""Edwards Scissorhands"". She, Sally, puts fatality in front of Jack's fake, emulative, blind belief. Because in your project there is the ego, even if it glimpses your image, believe in the simplicity of recreating Christmas. The result is that with immoral means, even the convincing innocence in Jack's work, it still doesn't determine his understanding of what Christmas is, much less what happiness is, since the film is almost a theft of festivity, with each party having its way of being happy.Because ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" recreates the Christmas spirit with the traditional gothic touches of Burton and Selick, without failing, with that, to lose its essence. Counting on the subtlety of the director and the inventiveness of the creator of this story, the apex of the film is precisely when we discover that the Christmas spirit here is also present in the union of individuals, whoever they may be. But what moves the most in the film is Sally's platonic passion (voice of Catherine O'Hara), a kind of monster of Frankenstein who is treated like a daughter by the mad scientist Dr. Finklestein (voice of William Hickey), for Jack. The most sensitive songs are on account of Sally, but the best ones are on account of Boggarts (voice of Ken Page), including the best musical number too, with a backdrop full of fluorescent colors. By the way, the entire art direction of the film is fantastic.Technical elements aside, the movie's greatest asset is really its brilliant story. Able to please the whole family, the tale of the skeleton who wanted to be Santa Claus for a day takes us back to the famous popular saying that people are what they are born for. In Jack's case, he passes on and renounces his status as the horror king in search of a world he has discovered and idealized and which he thinks is happy in it. And it will be from this new perception that he will look back and value his own universe and his real condition, as well as all of Burton's characters who look for nothing but ways to be happy. And isn't that exactly what we're all looking for? And that we are often blinded by the discoveries we make and only later realize the reality? That would be a good thought for everyone who comes to see the movie. Analogies aside, The Nightmare Before Christmas works very well as entertainment. A great movie that came from the imagination of a great character creator and excellent storyteller.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A definite milestone in stop-motion animation that everyone should watch.,"So I know it's a little late to be writing this review on a Halloween themed animated movie, but I was watching it the other day on my VCR and thought that it was absolutely fantastic. There are WAY too many things I like about this movie, but I'll just name a few.First of all, I think the soundtrack composed by musical genius Danny Elfman is engaging and very impressive, and my particular favorite songs are ""This is Halloween"" in the beginning and ""What's This"" that Jack Skellington, the main male protagonist in the movie, sings when he accidentally slips into Christmas Town.I also love all the different varieties of characters seen throughout the film, including the mayor of Halloween Town who has two different faces (one being happy and one being sad) as well as a spider necktie, Dr. Finkelstein whose name is supposed to be a parody of Frankenstein (he's not so nice), and Sally the Ragdoll who was created by Finkelstein and is Jack Skellington's girlfriend.But to me, the most significant element of the nightmare is that not only is it a movie based on Halloween, but also there's a lot of other elements that have a tremendous amount to do with Christmas, as the title suggests. Before the climax of the film, all the citizens of Halloween Town help make a new Santa outfit for Jack where Sally sews his hat, and then later Jack, along with his ghost dog Zero, leave Halloween Town via sleigh and help save Christmas when all the boys and girls there receive scary and frightening toys that end up chasing them and waking up their parents when they're sleeping. Sadly he ends up falling into a cemetery, but there's a secret passage that takes Jack back to Halloween Town when Sally and Santa Clause are in trouble and are about to be stewed by the villain in the movie, Oogie Boogie who is very cool, but also very spooky and creepy. In the end, the good kids in Christmas Town get regular toys that don't magically come to life and chase them, and Jack and Sally end up together when they kiss on the top of Spiral Hill.For anyone who is curious as to where 3-D animation originated, this is definitely an animated hallmark of a film to check out, and I particularly recommend that people watch it on Halloween or on Christmas as I did. You may think that ""Toy Story"" was the first ever 3-D animated movie in history, but think again because you'd be wrong. While ""Toy Story"" is considered the very first computer- animated movie, this one is actually stop-motion animation which is also in 3-D. This is a movie that will not only delight you and make you become addicted to its soundtrack, but it will also take you to a magical world from the incredible imagination of Mr. Tim Burton.Anyone who hasn't seen this yet, DEFINITELY SEE IT FOR YOURSELVES!",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Oh, so cute and twisted.","This movie is so dark, funny and cute its hard to explain, but i'll try, here goes.Jack Skellington is the king of Halloween, the scariest guy in town. But he's bored and restless with life. One night, walking in the woods, he comes across a doorway to Christmastown, where everyone is happy, kind, cheerful and no ones dead! He decides he wants to try Christmas himself, so all of Halloweentown try to claim Christmas while preparing for their very own Christmas eve...This has got to be the best animation films i have ever seen, it is not up-to-date computer technology with fancy lighting effects and computerised water reflection. Its old-fashioned, simple puppet animation, and it fits fantastically. The attention to detail is extraordinary, Halloweentown pacifically looks wonderfully Gothic. Christmas town is..well..christmassy. The puppets movement seems a little jittery the first time you watch it, but once you are used to the style you will not notice anything drastic.You do really feel for Jack as a depressed skeleton, bored with his life. You want him to find what hes looking for. Also for Sally, Jacks unnoticed, under appreciated love interest who knows something will go wrong and tries in vain to stop Christmas. The greatest characters though are the Oogie Boogie man, a gambling addict, slightly old school town misfit brilliantly voiced by Ken Page. And the Mayor, who has two personalities, optimistic or neurotic, depending which side of his head your talking too!The music is catchy, although sometimes it gets in the way of important character development, and everyone in the cast can sing (which is unusual for this type of musical.) Only one song is a little boring and that is the slow one which is sung by Jack second, but you soon forget about that and on to the brilliant ones like 'Kidnap mr. Sandy Claws' and 'The Oogie Boogie song.'My only glich with this film is it doesn't spend enough time on the character development the other residents of Halloweentown, spending far too much time on Jack. I for one would love too discover more about Oogie Boogie, like why was he outcast in the first place? and why does he seem to have a vendetta with Jack? And there are a lot of background characters who i would have loved too see more of. Wolfman, The hanging tree, the 2 witches, the slime monster and the Vampires to name a few.A cute little plot woven in with brilliant characters and catchy songs, Tim Burton has outdone himself with this holiday treat for everyone!",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Visually superb, although it's style over substance","Jack is a skeleton living in a scary faraway dimension where bizarre creatures reside and embark to scare children on Halloween every year. But Jack longs for a different life outside the restraints of horror - he doesn't like who he is. One day he wanders outside the limits of the haunted city and through a snowy forest, finding Santa Claus and his Elves' workshop.Inspired, Jack decides to kidnap Santa Claus and turn Christmas into Halloween.The ads for this movie were always very grim. It used to boast, ""From producer Tim Burton!"" and his influence is very clear - extremely Gothic visuals. And, for a children's tale, some pretty scary stuff! Overall this is style over substance, as are most films associated with Burton. He rarely delivers great stories and instead relies on fairytale clichÃ©s (Edward Scissorhands, Big Fish, etc.).There's nothing wrong with this. It works because his films are so nice to look at.This is a fun movie with good visuals and an interesting twist on a familiar tale. I recommend it, as long as you don't expect something emotionally involving or brilliant story-wise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Enthralling film, but more Lock, Shock and Barrel needed!","The Nightmare Before Christmas has captivated me with its crazy and sinister animation, its haunting soundtrack and its horrific yet enchanting characters. When it was first released in the U.K., the trailers terrified me and I refused to go and see it. However, I have now aquired deeply sadistic humour and so relish in such brilliant and infectious songs like ""Kidnap the Sandy Claws"". My friends and family now get exceedingly annoyed by my attempts to recite the musical score on car journeys etc. The sets and props are amazing and painstakingly detailed-just take a look at Santa's list and the Halloween/Christmas plans. I only have one complaint; there should have been more appearances from Lock, Shock and Barrel: a thoroughly malevolent trio.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

It would be better were it not a musical.,"First, I want to say that ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a very neat idea for a movie. If it comes from Tim Burton (although he just produces, not directs), then it's pretty much guaranteed that there's something cool in store. The idea of a land where there's only Halloween having Christmas one year while forcing Halloween on a land where there's only Christmas...a really cool concept. And it's worth seeing what the movie shows happening.Now for the unfortunate aspect. The excessive number of songs weakens the movie. I don't mind a song or two - or more in a Beatles movie - but it's just sort of hokey to have a song every five minutes in a movie that supposed to be macabre.So, if you see ""TNBC"", you can appreciate the concept, but you just might get put off by the musical aspect.

One of the greatest movies I've ever seen!,"I remember when I was in 3rd grade I became obsessed with ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". I remember telling my friends at school my own ""stories"" of some of the characters. To this day, I still love it.Everything about this movie is excellent, great, beautiful, every positive word you can think of. The songs, the animation, the characters, everything! Let's start with some of them.The songs are excellent and they should've been nominated for an Oscar for Best Songs, and it should've won! My favorite song is Sally's Song, which is just too gorgeous for words. I also love This is Halloween, Kidnap the Sandy Claws (that song is hilarious), and Oogie Boogie Man, which reminds me of a Ray Charles song.The characters are great, too. Jack, who is wise and independent; Sally, who is gorgeous, sweet, and kind; the Mayor, who's chatty and talkative; Lock, Shock, and Barrel, who are mischievous but friendly; Dr. Finkelstein, who's usually grumpy all the time; and of course, the Oogie Boogie Man, who's evil.The animation is gorgeous, not like anything else I've seen. The movie was made in the early '90s and it has the most spectacular animation of any animated movie made in the '90s! This has been one of my favorite animated movies for a long time and it still is. In fact, when I get older and have a career in show business, I'll release an album where I sing songs from ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". You'll soon see! This is a great movie and one of my favorite movies of all time. Great job, Tim Burton!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"A Quirky, Enjoyable Movie","I watched this movie for the first time the day after Halloween as a sort of bridge from the spooky season to the Christmas season. After finishing It, I had a couple thought. First of all, the animation is a feast for the eyes and the music is phenomenal. Tim Burton is an artistic genius and the effects and music were thoroughly satisfying. That being said, I felt it was way too short. The action rose and fell far too quickly, and the high drama at the end felt forced. The crux of the plot came to easily and too soon. If they had made it a little longer and deeper, the film would be perfect. But that should in no way stop you from seeing this. It's a great spooky Christmas flick for your older kids and parents.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A must see for all of those who would like to dwell in Tim Burton's universe,"Having been a great fan of Tim Burton's work for years, I found this movie relatively late, but I don't believe that has influenced at all my opinion on the movie.No matter whether we're in 1993 or in 2005, Tim Burton's genius is as brilliant in this movie as he is in Corpse Bride or in most of his films. Like no one else, he captures beauty in the most horrible places and the most terrible looking creatures, and he warms our hearts with that beauty.In The Nightmare Before Christmas again he transforms a nightmarish world into something cheerful and insanely merry, where there is always a place for love. It's this inversion of probable scenarios and the complexity of the main characters, in opposition to the supporting ones who are usually type characters, that makes the world of Tim Burton's creations so appetizingly interesting for children as well as for adults.And don't forget the delicious songs by Danny Elfman, for me the best and most subversive musical creator in Hollywood. I can't imagine anyone else making soundtracks for Burton's movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Guess I'm glad I waited this long . . .,"So I decided I needed to finally watch this, as I LOVE halloween and I noticed this year more NBC items for Halloween, plus, it seems everyone loves this movie . . . Well . . . I don't get it.Plot is simple, character development is void, songs are boring (you never hear anyone singing them) . . . Plus, I can't tell if this is a Halloween movie or an Xmas movie. Most definitely NOT a kids movie.Classic? Umm no. I do like Jack, though. But the plot at times is illogical (and no, I don't mean unrealistic).I feel like the movie should, or could have been 15-30 minutes longer and actually developed the characters. Really, none of them, except maybe Jack, have any explanation behind them. Sally literally has no place in this movie. I feel like I watched an edited movie and someone pulled a fast one on me and edited out all the good parts.Can't imagine ever needing or wanting to see it again.",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Magic, Tim Burton Style","With the advent of video/DVD, certain movies lend themselves to annual viewing during specific holiday seasons, especially Halloween (It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown'), Thanksgiving (`Home for the Holidays'), and of course, The Big One, Christmas (Insert your own favorites here); specific films that for whatever reason manifest the spirit of their respective times of the year, and they generally match up one season per film.  Filmmaker Tim Burton, however, has the distinction of having created a singular film to add to this category, unique in that it is suited equally to both Halloween AND Christmas.  And it tops the entire list of the titles of which that can be said; in fact, it IS the list-- there simply are no others.  Burton's brainchild, which had a gestation period of many years before at last being realized in 1993 is, indeed, in a category of it's own.  It is, of course, `The Nightmare Before Christmas,' directed by Henry Selick.Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon), the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, can put the scare on like no one else.  But after years of doing what he does best-- scaring the wits out of children of all ages, everywhere, every Halloween-- he's bored; depressed, even.  There's just no `rush' in it for him anymore.  So, after a particularly unfulfilling Allhallow's Eve, Jack wanders off alone into the night to contemplate his circumstance and his future, whereupon he inadvertently stumbles into `Christmas Town,' and discovers something new (`What's this?  What's this!')-- a different holiday, as well as the celebration that accompanies it.  Most importantly, though, he also discovers his counterpart, the one who is to this holiday what he is to Halloween.  `And they call... him... San-Dee CLAWS!'  And Jack, his eyes and ears filled with the sights and sounds of Christmas, is more excited than he's been in a long, long while.  He doesn't know, yet, what all of this is about, but he's going to find out; and he's already made up his mind:  Whatever it is, it's going to be his!  Sandee Claws, step aside-- Jack Skellington is here!Through the magic of stop-motion animation, Burton's vision-- his story and the characters who populate his `nightmare'-- comes vividly to life, the process of which is guided along nicely by director Selick.  And what a bunch of characters there are!  Besides Jack (who is, without question, the star of the show), there is the two-faced (literally) Mayor (Glenn Shadix); Dr. Finklestein (wonderfully voiced by William Hickey); Lock, Shock and Barrel (Paul Reubens, Catherine O'Hara, Danny Elfman), the unholy trio who work for the dreadful Mr. Oogie Boogie (Ken Page); and, last but not least, gentle and compassionate Sally (Catherine O'Hara), who cares for Jack and so badly wants to help him find whatever it is he's looking for.  Intriguing characters for a highly original story, imaginatively drawn and presented with care and an expertise that really makes this one work.Another element that sells it is the engaging score and original songs by Danny Elfman (who also supplies Jack's singing voice).  And Selick uses the music wisely to create an appropriate atmosphere and mood conducive to the storyline.  The songs, especially, are haunting, hypnotic, upbeat and theatrical, and combined with the magic of the splendid visual content, helps set the tone for a rich and thoroughly entertaining experience.The supporting cast includes (the voices of) Ed Ivory (Santa), Susan McBride (Big Witch), Debi Durst (Corpse Kid/Corpse Mother/Small Witch), Greg Proops (Harlequin Demon/Devil/Sax Player), Kerry Katz (Man Under Stairs/Vampire/Corpse Father), Randy Crenshaw (Mr. Hyde/Behemoth/Vampire), Sherwood Ball (Mummy/ Vampire), Carmen Twillie (Undersea Gal/Man Under the Stairs) and Glenn Waters (Wolfman).  There's a decidedly dark side to this film that may be disturbing to younger viewers, but for those to whom the monster-in-the-closet no longer appears, `The Nightmare Before Christmas' is good for TWO of your favorite holidays (or actually, for any time of the year, for that matter).  Unique, to say the least, this is a fun foray into fantasy that can be enjoyed time and again.  The story, the characters, the images, the songs; it's all magic.  It is, in fact, the magic of the movies. Tim Burton style.  I rate this one 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Tremendous imagination isn't enough to stretch a wisp of a plot to feature-length,"This is a movie about a Halloweentown VIP who dreams of doing more than terrifying people once a year. When he discovers a door to Christmastown, he gets an idea.And that is most of the plot of The Nightmare Before Christmas.At only 76 minutes, Nightmare is very short by theatrical release standards but it's very long for what it is, which is a kid's cartoon with less plot that the under-an-hour TV special Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.The story could easily be told in the length of time of How the Grinch Stole Christmas (under a half hour), so it is stretched out with generally unmemorable, overlong songs that often bring that wisp of a plot screeching to a halt. Time-wasting songs were something that's bothered me since I was a kid (in the 60s, when the songs were usually terrible - oh to grow up in the age of Encanto!). A few of the songs are pretty good (Like ""What is This"" and the Oogie Boogie song) but even the best numbers go on a bit long.While there isn't near enough solid material for a feature film, there is a lot to like in Nightmare. The animation style is distinctive and memorable and there are a lot of clever visual ideas. And the whole Halloween/Christmas mash-up is a genius concept that genuinely added something new to the world.In fact, cut this down to Rudolph length and you could have something really amazing. This absolutely should have been a TV special.Yes, mine is a minority opinion. People love this movie. One of those people is my girlfriend, who also likes the songs more than I do. But I saw this in 1993 and when I gave it a second chance almost 30 years later I had the exact same reaction, so I'm going to stick with that minority opinion.I would still say it's worth watching, but if you want to see a movie directed by Henry Selick you really ought to start with Coraline.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Xmas Comes to Halloweentown,"I abstained from Nightmare Before Christmas for years because (much like The Goonies) it has just been forced into popular culture, where I don't think it belongs. Neither film was massively popular or a critical success on their original release, but somewhere along the line the spirit of the films were hijacked.I hate seeing forlorn-looking, middle-class emo teenagers wearing Jack Skellington T-shirts as much as I hate the same crowd yelling ""Hey you, guys."" Were they even born when these films were made? Back to the film itself, it's a rather simple tale of a Halloween-themed world being exposed to the magic of Christmas. Jack Skellington and the denizens of Halloweentown welcome the magic, but no one really seems to understand that the macabre of Halloween and the Spirit of Christmas are utterly incongruous. I suppose this is a commentary on the inconsistency of what the public desires and how we are all easily programmed to like what the media tells us to like.The thin story is interspersed with several, generic Danny Elfman melodies and songs. The characters are amusing, especially the Mayor of Halloweentown, who's double-sided head periodically rotates between happiness and despair. And the atmosphere is also very nice, but I'm undecided if it's a Halloween film or an Xmas film.Overall, it's good, but not great. It's more like The Trap Door than it's like Wallace and Gromit, but still a pleasant distraction for the Xmas season.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"A masterpiece of highly imaginative proportions, and arguably Tim Burton's best film to date.","'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is one of those films that is a true one of a kind release, and a genuine benchmark for it's genre. The Nightmare Before Christmas has truly pushed the creative limits of the staid yet classic art form of stop motion clay animation, and truly highlighted to us the creative genius that Tim Burton has been internationally renowned as.The Nightmare Before Christmas is a film that uses it's music and general style of film-making to create a character's thoughts and mind. Such as when Jack Skellington sings about a longing feeling that he cannot find, he stands on top of a hill, in the night, and the moon reflects on his figure moving around in the scene. Danny Eflman's moody but arguably deep lyrics and musical score truly emulate Jack's feeling. Both the dark atmosphere of the shot, and decidedly gloomy music makes Jack's mind lost, unclear and cannot see what he truly desires for. The Nightmare Before Christmas therefore becomes a truly iconic and deep experience for any moviegoer to witness.Overall, The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of the best films I have seen in a long time, and one of my best as well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Music reminiscent of some of Kurt Weill's ""Die Dreigroschenoper""","I don't know if this has been mentioned before, but the influence of the Kurt Weill- Bertolt Brecht collaboration with some of the selections from their Threepenny Opera (German title: Die Dreigroschenoper) can be heard in the music of Nightmare Before Christmas. The atmosphere of the Threepenny Opera is invoked several times throughout this wonderful animated film. Listen to ""Mr. Peachum's Morning Hymn"" (Der Morgenchoral des Peachum), ""The Instead-Of Song"" (Anstatt-Dass Song), ""Ballad About the Question: 'What Keeps a Man Alive'"" (Ballade Ã¼ber die Frage: ""Wovon lebt der Mensch""), Perhaps the best version of Weill's Threepenny Opera is the one featuring Lotte Lenya on CBS Records Masterworks (Sony).

The Wonderful Movie to Watch on Halloween and Christmas,This movie is one of my favorite Disney movies and it is great to watch this movie on the Halloween and Christmas season. I liked the songs and the story was great.,10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Wouldn't you like to see something strange?,"And now the movie that made us debate endlessly: ""Are we supposed to watch it on Christmas or Halloween?""Obviously a brilliant concept from the guy who dreamt up Vincent (1982), The Nightmare Before Christmas' idea of blending a kid's two favourite holidays has attracted and sustained a fierce cult following. The basic idea is that holidays are places, and when Jack Skellington, king of Halloweentown, stumbles into Christmas Town, he feels a need to take it over. See, he's tired of Halloween, what anyone would feel if they were living the same holiday everyday. If he spent time in our universe and discovered we celebrate Christmas three months straight, he'd no doubt grow weary of it, too.In spite of being a Tim Burton fan, Nightmare Before Christmas wasn't regular viewing for me- I watched it once when it came out, and I may have been a bit young for it. Some things, like talk of Santa Claus being chopped up, are kind of freaky for a kid who, you know, still believes in Santa Claus. But as well, watching it now for the first time in years, the movie is lacking in a few areas- namely, the songs. One guy I went to university with complained ""This Is Halloween"" was the only great song in the movie, the rest was like nails on a chalkboard to him. Actually I'd say ""Sally's Song"" is great, too- a memorable, hauntingly sad tune I've been humming to myself for years. Beyond that, some songs are just forgettable- I just watched it, and I can't even remember what it sounded like when Jack decided to take over Christmas. What does ""Making Christmas"" sound like apart from the chorus? Other songs have elements of quality in them but drag on too long (""What's This?""). So yeah, for some kids, and adults, it would be a drag to see this movie.I love villains, but Oogie Boogie was also very underwhelming (""Let's make him a gambler! Why not?""). The mad scientist was a lot more interesting.Still, there's little denying the merit in the creativity, or the strange yet beautiful look of the stop motion animation. No wonder this movie has its fans.Happy Halloween.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

One of Burton's best,"There's really not much to say about this movie that hasn't already been said. I'm of the opinion that Tim Burton is a genius. The visual style of this film is so simple and a dark kind of exquisite. I actually cared about the characters, something that's rare for me in an animated film. There were so many little nuances in the film that I just adore. But my favorite thing about the movie is Danny Elfman. His singing voice is absolutely beautiful and it just furthered my belief that he's a genius musician. The score is just exquisite. There's really not much more I can say about it, except that it's a true masterpiece and is right up there with Edward Scissorhands.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Always one of my favorites,"I watched The Nightmare Before Christmas for the first time when it was released for the first time; I was nine years old. Growing up in a country where whatever knowledge I had of Christmas and Halloween came from American TV, I missed a lot of the jokes and a lot of the references, but I enjoyed the colorful characters, zany adventure and dark slapstick. I loved it.I watched it again when I was 16 and going to art school, during a lecture about adult animation. This time I enjoyed the stylish design, the meticulously made stop-motion animation and the infectious songs. Loved it.And I watched it for a third time when I was 22 and studying design. I now knew the careers of both Henry Selick and Tim Burton back to front, and could appreciate just how much of a landmark the film was for both of them. I could also appreciate the subtle pokes at American culture, and the clever homage to both classic animated Christmas specials and German expressionist cinema. Loved it.I now tend to watch The Nightmare Before Christmas approximately once a year. It's not a tradition or anything, I still don't celebrate Christmas or Halloween. There just always seems to be some good reason to watch it, as it's one of the shortest, quickest, and most enjoyable of my all time favorite films. And I enjoy it every time. It's wildly imaginative, beautifully animated in stop-motion animation that isn't likely to age any time soon, gorgeously designed and wonderfully scored. It refused to acknowledge the idea that an animated film has to make a choice between kids' and adults' animation; it's directed at mature and intelligent kids, and at young-at-heart adults, two years before Pixar started making films that made the same choice.Most of all, The Nightmare Before Christmas remains one of a kind. Burton tried to recreate the magic with Corpse Bride and failed miserably. It's funny, it's filled with sarcasm but also surprisingly touching and idealistic. It's the best movie Tim Burton never made, and it will always be one of my all time favorites.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A terrifying classic full of wonder and imagination that captivated us back at the 90's,"Growing up in the 90's, I never heard of Tim Burton until a few years later, as a teenage, I watched most of them, but while some of his films are good, I think that the best Burton film would have to be this, a stop-motion animated film about a pumpkin king who turns Halloween into Christmas.Now, when I had the VHS copy of this film, I got really terrified at most parts in which they're very scary, but to my surprise, it was a well-put together film and it's a classic that still holds up to today on it's 20th anniversary. My only nitpick is that it's a bit too short, but there's a lot of good things about this classic.The story is original and a nice concept that is well-done. The animation is great and the visuals are solid. From Halloween Town to the North Pole and everything else is detailed very nicely. The character models are great and the characters themselves are great too. Not to mention the voice acting for the characters is really impressive.Chris Sarandon and Catherine O'Hara as Jack Skellington and Sally, the rag doll, are great and the romance between them is so cute. The other characters are well-voiced, but Oogie Boogie steals the show for being an entertaining villain voiced perfectly by Ken Page (who voiced King Gator in All Dogs Go To Heaven). The singing voice for Jack from Danny Elfman is great and in fact, the songs are very catchy in an animated musical since the times of Disney.""This Is Halloween"", ""What's This?"", ""Sally's Song"", and ""The Oogie Boogie Song"" along with others are catchy and memorable to this day. The music score from Danny Elfman is great with a mixture of dark, Gothic, whimsical, and comedic that is done perfectly well. The tone is solid too with it's dark and scary moments and it's hilarious and light- hearted moments.Overall, A Nightmare Before Christmas is a classic worth recommending to those who haven't seen it yet before Halloween will end and will always be a classic to those who grew up with it.

Vintage claymation is fine with me.,"Okay, I've seen this movie three times, twice on TV and once in theaters (the theaters screening was yesterday with 3-D) and I think the movie is best watched in 3-D. This film is by no means bad. In fact, it's very cleaver and fun to see a vintage claymation movie anywhere. More examples are the Wallace & Gromit shorts that played way back then. I think ""Nightmare"" was the first feature-length claymation movie, right? Anyway, don't answer. It's pretty hard to do that in a comment. Don't look for this question by me in the message boards.I try not to have my rating for this film at the beginning because I think 3-D is better than 2-D.

Lovely,"A beautifully creepy brief movie, were we get a first glimpse of Henry Selick, odd and fascinating thoughts. Tim Burton is as well known for his most unusual ideas, the character and picture we get to familiar ourselves with in this movie is unquestionably deviant. The animation was somewhat new to me, odd, pointy, squeaky eyes, long, short, scary, unlike anything else i could imagine, but i cherished every second of it. I'm not certain what kind of audience they were aiming towards, i can only imagine a child would be frightened by this kind of animation and atmosphere. This movie has to rely a lot on the music involved, so choosing the right composer who is experienced in the spooky/Goth themes is important, Danny Elfman has worked with this before and showed that he is competent enough, and was the perfect choice.Jack, our main character, lives in a Gothic world with monsters and nightmares, were death is around the corner. He stumbles upon this colorful world, which opposite to what he's used to (which is dull colors) this world consists of cheerful, living people and a colorful environment. Jack is a unhappy, dead, creature which feels emptiness and is searching for something unknown, jack, despite being a monster, he only wants to contribute and do good deeds, but doesn't realize they aren't so good after all. One can speculate if there is a moral of this story, i believe that its about not trying to change yourself, and accept yourself for who you are.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

a dark and imaginative musical,"Tired with Halloween Pumpkin King Jack Skellington finds a land called Christmas Town and plans to make the festivities very frightening.Tim Burton's vivid imagination has made him a modern day great and this is a sparkling gem with an acute perception of the holidays.Opening with a catchy song ""This is Halloween"", Henry Selick's picture sets the tone for an entertaining and interesting adventure starring a spiderlike central character Jack Skellington is a wonderful creation, filled with many human emotions including hope and challenge and is easy to watch. Danny Elfman has pitched the songs to match Skellington perfectly, especially when he first sees Christmas Town ""What's this?"" The animation may feel slightly dated with CGI taking over the genre but the features on the DVD including the making of will leave you feeling heart warmed and inspired by the work and effort the team went to in order to achieve the visually stunning Oscar nominated effects.The plot is very enjoyable. However there are slight shortcomings when an important decision becomes an instant realisation. For example the 'what to do about Christmas' dilemma. Nevertheless the dialogue is likable and is told with that charm of fantasy verses reality that Burton does exceptionally well.The songs are always upbeat and all the characters get a chance to sing and shine, giving the picture a creative diversity. Jack's explanation of Christmas to the town of Halloween is a particularly annoying part with other characters disrupting the flow of the song.But this is a minor flaw when you have the classic well recognized ""What's this"" discovery song, not to mention a wonderfully colourful moment from Oogie Boogie. These two songs bring the light out of the darkness and are the finest moments of the film.The humour doesn't live up to recent Burton animation The Corpse Bride but the characters in this animation are far better. The imagination and darkness of the picture should not be discouraged and should be applied to more animations.The direction gives a charm that isn't horrific but pleasantly spooky and is therefore suitable for the whole family. The likability and humanity of the characters also help give this picture a relaxing and enjoyable realisation that isn't to be missed.The Nightmare before Christmas has been recognized as a 90's classic with its catchy songs and a good plot that is memorable if not the sharpest and funniest you will ever see.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Gothic stop-motion masterpiece: an essential holiday film,"An animated Disney production from 1993 directed by Henry Selick (Coraline, Wendell & Wild), The Nightmare Before Christmas follows ""Pumpkin King"" Jack Skellington's doomed adventures from Halloween Town to Christmas Town and back again.Based on a story and characters by Tim Burton, the film is a stop-motion animated musical featuring the singing voice of Danny Elfman, who also wrote the score. While it wasn't a huge hit initially, it soon achieved cult classic status and is seen, to this day, as one of the best animated features of all time. Two holidays are cleverly intertwined here as Jack Skellington (voiced by Chris Sarandon), a Halloween hero, grows tired of entertaining his usual ghoulish crowd, delivering the same spooky thrills year after year. When he discovers a place called Christmas Town, he becomes enamored with the entire concept and so decides to... take it for himself.A loving yet twisted pastiche of classic Rankin/Bass specials, as well as Dr Seuss' How The Grinch Stole Christmas and other classic cartoons, The Nightmare Before Christmas lures you in quick with its delightfully macabre ""This Is Halloween"" tune and it never lets go as Danny Elfman offers catchy song after catchy song, making the most of each one in his own unique style. This may have been Tim Burton's idea, and it may be Henry Selick's masterpiece, but it is, first and foremost, Elfman's baby: his work here is nothing short of genius and deserved a lot more recognition back in the day. From the lonely ""Jack's Lament"" to the bombastic ""What's This?"", the beautiful ""Sally's Song"", the playful ""Making Christmas"" and the devilish ""Oogie Boogie's Song"", the movie never missteps and is singalong-worthy from start to finish.The animation here is, frankly, incredible. This is stop-motion at its best with every shot carefully composed, Tim Burton's art style perfectly captured and the emotions of all these bizarre characters conveyed with great care. The character design is unique, the settings are appropriately gothic and countless inventive techniques are used here to make the animation flow in harmony with the music. The film looks gorgeous, of course, but it also has a timeless, nostalgic feel that'll make you want to watch it for both aforementioned holidays every single year. We care about these characters, feel for them, and can't wait to see them naively attempt the impossible in true Halloween Town style!Few animated films manage to get everything right: The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of those rarities. Hugely entertaining, a visual treat, a truly fantastic musical and, despite its frightening look, very very funny, not to mention filled with the magic that many Christmas movies promise but so often fail to materialize. It's one hell of a sleigh ride and viewers of all ages should get a big kick out of it.Essential holiday romp.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The triumph of stop motion,"There's life in stop motion yet.  Burton and Selick's film is a fine retort to `Toy Story'; or at least it would have been if `Toy Story' had been made first.  Fluid, three-dimensional animation in a completely designed world - that's what the two films have in common, but `The Nightmare Before Christmas' looks undeniably better.  Partly it's the more imaginative art direction.  Partly, also, it's just the fact that there's something enervating about digital effects, and something special about using real, physical artwork, and photographing it.  I don't know how well the world of Halloween will stand up over the years, but no-one will forget what it looks like.The plot alarmingly resembles that of a Rankin/Bass TV special, but with more teeth.  Jack Skellington, ruler of the land of Halloween, falls in love with the land of Christmas, and decides to conquer it.  The difference between `Nightmare' and its dismal TV cousins is that the land of Halloween really is a grisly place.  (Gorgeous, but grisly.)  Jack Skellington is a gentle ruler with an imperfect hold on power.  (Santa Claus, by contrast, is not quite the innocent he appears to be.)  It all ends a little too soon: I would have liked to see more attention paid to the story after all the fun scene-setting.  Still, it's a delicious movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
'Twas the night before Christmas and one thing was certain: everyone thought this was directed by Burton.,"'The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)' is perhaps the only example of both a Halloween and a Christmas movie all in one (as well as being one of the only true examples of the former). It's a splendidly strange stop-motion musical that blends the horrific with the holiday cheer, the spooky with the snow angels and the macabre with the mistletoe in a decidedly delightful, certifiably classic, brilliantly Burton-esque way (though it's not directed by the big man himself, instead unmistakably being a Selick-helmed affair). It isn't incredibly compelling, nor especially memorable when it comes to its music. It also suffers from some strange pacing issues and doesn't quite feel cohesive as a whole. Still, it's almost instantly iconic thanks to its weird, genre-confident visuals which are brought to life wonderfully, one frame at a time. 6/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

A Classic,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is a stop-motion film that incorporates two holidays that are loved by many into one film that can be watch for both Halloween and Christmas. The movie is about the protagonist Jack Skellington, voiced by both Danny Elfman (singing voice) and Chris Sarandon (voice), who is no longer excited about Halloween, he wants to do something else and after a series of events he decides that he wants to try a different holiday, that holiday being Christmas. The movie also follows the store of Sally, voiced by Catherine O'Hare and her wanting to be free from Dr. Frankenstein, voiced by William Hickley while at the same time trying to warn Jack that his plan going to end horribly. Then there is the antagonist, Oogie Boogie, voiced by Ken Page, while Jack is the King of Halloween, what he does is not out of malice but out of the love he has for all things spooky and scarry, Oogie Boogie likes to scare and torture others because he is the boogie man.There are at least two themes for The Nightmare Before Christmas and that is you should be yourself and that one's actions my begin with good intentions does not mean that those actions will be perceived by others in the same light. Jack saw and experienced a holiday that is new to him, and he thought that it was something he could do, he wanted to make people happy in his own misguided way. Because Jack was tired of the same thing year after year, he wanted to change but it wasn't until he failed did, he realize who he is. After accepting that he is the pumpkin king he knew that he must fix his mistake and set everything right again. There are many movies that share a similar theme to this on some level, the movie The Duff, a movie about a girl who finds out how other people see her and wants to change. While this is a live action movie and not a stop-motion and is also about the coming of age of the main protagonist, it still falls in line with being true to who you are and cleaning up the messes you made along the road to coming to this realization.Through out the movie, the protagonist Jack, and the antagonist Oogie Boogie both have monologues describing who they are and what they do. When Jack is in the graveyard, he begins to sing a monologue about how great he is as the Pumpkin King but how it no longer satisfies him and how he wants to do something else. Oogie Boogie on the other hand, while he too monologues about who he is but when he does so it is not like Jack, Oogie Boogie enjoys who he is and the things that he does. Sally, the deuteragonist, has a monologue as well but not to talk about herself but about her feelings about the events that are about to take place as well as the feelings she has for Jack. These monologues are important to the theme of the movie in that Jack has many instances where he is monologuing to himself because he is the most confused as to what it is that he wants to do, while Oogie and Sally both know who they are and what it is they want to do.Overall, this movie is fun to watch year after year. I watched this movie as a child when it came out and there are not many movies from my childhood that I can watch today with my daughter, mostly because not many of them interest her like this one mostly impart to the animation style and the story line.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Greatest Culture Impact of Burton's Career,"Now, my fellow Halloween fans, tell me: How many times do you listen to ""This is Halloween"" during the spookiest time of the year? Well I know I've been known to play the entire soundtrack on loop for the entire month of October. Danny Elfman really perfects the haunting and enchanting tone of the tale that is Nightmare Before Christmas. Honestly, I think I may have seen the movie maybe a dozen times, but listening to the soundtrack, yeah, that's gotta be at least hundreds of loops. Oogie Boogie's song and Jack's Lament would definitely be in the top three songs along with This Is Halloween.And just a side note to add to audio, the casting was well done. Shout out to Ken Page, Catherine O'Hara and Danny Elfman for carrying the movie with their awesome voice acting.While this is Tim Burton's first Animation, Nightmare Before Christmas is an overhaul of the artistic Burton style seen in movies like Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands. While Burton animations are far and few in between, all three of his animated features are stop motion, which definitely works best for Burton's designs.At the time this move came out, Burton was already making a name of himself from his earliest works. Though I believe Nightmare Before Christmas to be the single most greatest culture impact Tim Burton has ever achieved in his life. Jack Skellington is to Halloween what Jesus is to Christianity. Merch is almost guaranteed at any Hot Topic, Spencer's, or any other nerdy store. The Pumpkin King is the face of the holiday as much as Tim Burton himself is. And the mix of the two biggest holidays is practically the most celebrated crossover of all time. This movie basically owns the last third of the year. And given the film's large presence even after (nearly) 30 years, it's already proven to be timeless.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"Visually enchanting, musically entertaining, and way, WAY too memorable...","Anyone who is remotely acquainted with me has probably heard me whine that some movie I saw - and I see a lot of them - just wasn't memorable enough, that I'd forget it in a few years. I saw ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" for the first time at the age of three. Nearly twelve years later, I began dating a young man who was obsessed with it, and I saw it again. Between these two time periods, I remembered the movie far more clearly than I would have liked. A movie isn't worth seeing if you aren't going to remember it, but this one was so bizarre, it stuck out in my memory a bit TOO much.Jack Skellington (Danny Elfman and Chris Sarandon) is a...thing...that is eight or perhaps ten feet tall and yet appears to weigh about the same as the average school textbook. He's also the ""Pumpkin King"" of a place called Halloweentown, where the distinguishing feature of the residents is that they all look like they recently walked through the mosh pit at Lollapalooza. It is not uncommon to see heads flying around without their bodies or Frankenstein-like creations running around loose or anything out of your childhood nightmares. No wonder Jack is kind of depressed. So when he quite by accident stumbles upon a place called Christmastown, and decides that he would like to bring some Christmas spirit to his homeland, things get a little messy. For one thing, his idea of Christmas cheer is to have Santa Claus kidnapped by another...thing...called Oogie Boogie (Ken Page) and pose as (a rather anorexic) Saint Nick himself. Are you scratching your head yet? You're not alone. There are...things...in Halloweentown which literally scratch their brains.Other main...things (characters)...include Sally (Catherine O'Hara), a Rocky Horror-or-Frankenstein-style creation of a mad scientist who is the object of Jack's romantic affections (and vice-versa); Lock, Shock, and Barrel (Pee-wee Herman, Catherine O'Hara, and Danny Elfman) (Jerry Thorpe fans are picketing outside), three evil little sidekicks who do a good deal of eyebrow-raising, and the Evil Scientist (original, huh? I needed that) who created Sally in the first place. And Santa Claus. But that poor man's been tortured enough.The music is catchy and well-written, the animation is stellar, and the cast dovetails perfectly with the roles. Tim Burton has proved time and time again that he's quite an original director. But some stories are just too weird to get out of the campfire circle, and this might be one of them. Most people I know over the age of thirty-five will curl up like boiled shrimp at the mere mention of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas."" Therefore, while I myself thought it was an entertaining piece of film, I'm not sure it's fit for the public at large. There are some things the world just isn't ready for. Mr. Burton, I commend you. You are way before your time.Grade: B",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas is a humorous spooky good time!,"Saw The Nightmare Before Christmas a couple of days ago with a friend who was a little down in the dumps. Neither of us had seen this before so it was a pleasant surprise for both of us as we put on our 3-D glasses to watch Tim Burton's classic stop-motion animated film. Technically, Burton didn't direct this since he was busy making Batman Returns at the time but even with Henry Selick listed as director you can see Tim's hand-prints in every frame. With a voice cast that includes Paul Reubens (as Lock), Catherine O'Hara (as heroine Sally and Shock), William Hickey (as Dr. Finkelstein), Chris Sarandon (as leading character Jack Skellington), Ken Page (as the scene stealing Ooogie Boogie), and Danny Elfman, who's also composer of the movie's songs (as the singing voice of Skellington, Barrel, and the Clown with the Tear away Face), this is one of the most humorously spooky movies I've ever seen. What Jack does to Christmas, you have to see to believe! While the 3-D was impressive in the beginning, I forgot about it after a while and just let the story and music entertain me. My favorite part concerned the Halloweentown band trying to do their version of ""Here Comes Santa Claus"" which ends up sounding pretty somber! So for anyone interested in Burton's version of a Holloween/Christmas hybrid, The Nightmare Before Christmas may be for you!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Most Iconic stop-motion film of all-time,"""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is not my favorite Disney or Favorite Tim Burton film however, it's pretty damn close. This film is so nostalgic for me, and I felt this film deserved a spot on this list. This film is actually not directed by Tim Burton, it's directed by Henry Selick, who also did ""Coraline"" and ""James and the Giant Peach"". Though, Tim Burton did create the entire story and all the characters. This movie has some of the greatest music ever put in a film, especially ""Jack's Lament"", which is my favorite track. Danny Elfman voiced Jack's singing voice, but they had Chris Sarandon do the dialogue. The film is beautifully shot, and contains some very impressive stop-motion. Overall, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is probably the most iconic stop-motion of all-time, and has some of the most iconic imagery ever put on film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"From the mind of Tim Burton, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a Claymation adaption of ""The Night Before Christmas"".","From the mind of Tim Burton, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a Claymation adaption of ""The Night Before Christmas"". Directed by Henry Selick the film features the voice acting of Danny Elfman and Chris Sarandon both playing the part of Jack Skellington, Catherine O'Hara as Sally, William Hickey as the Evil Scientist, and Glenn Sadix as the Mayor of Halloweentown. The film was a groundbreaking Claymation production that features thousands of tiny clay figurines that needed to be posed and moved hundreds of times each just to create one scene.The Nightmare before Christmas takes place in a world with different mystical towns for each holiday, such as Eastertown, Halloweentown, and Christmas town. Jack Skellington, the king of Halloweentown, stumbles across Christmas town and is immediately infatuated with it despite not fully understanding what Christmas is, or what it means. The movie centers around Jack's growing obsession with this newfound holiday and how he can incorporate it into Halloweentown.Song and dance is one of the key components that progresses the story throughout the film, however, the Theme of The Nightmare Before Christmas is the internal battle that Jack Skellington is fighting. It is apparent from the onset of the movie that he has an empty feeling inside and is trying to figure out why. His obsession with Christmas is an attempt to fill that emptiness and reinvigorate the passion he once had for Halloween. There are several points in the movie that Jack is forced to stop and question what he is doing and why he is doing it. He has a very difficult time understand why he is so captivated by Christmas. The characters that push him through the movie the most are Sally, who portrays the good innocent side of the battle Jack is fighting, and the Evil Scientist, who pushes Jack in a darker more maniacal direction. Jack's internal battle is much less serious than films that would share this central theme. Typical plots in this category sometimes involve depression, drug or alcohol addiction, or serious family problems.Nearly all of the cinematography within The Nightmare before Christmas is, or was, extremely fresh and exciting for viewers. The movements of characters due to the Claymation process was slightly unnatural but in a very interesting way. The film employs a varying types of lighting techniques to transition from scary Halloweentown creature to scary Halloweentown creature. Varying degrees of framing allow for most of the inhabitants of Halloweentown to seem almost casually terrifying. Viewers are quick to forget that many of this town's inhabitant are the stuff of nightmares and it would take outsiders being exposed to them to bring that point back to light.Overall The Nightmare before Christmas was superbly done and became an instant cult classic. 22 years later and it is still a great film to watch with a very unique premise. In this day and age, a unique plot is something that is difficult to come by. The story, the Claymation, the cinematography, and catchy songs that the character regularly burst into all create a very memorable film that is worth re-watching time and time again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"great eye candy, yet thin story","This movie has a very simple basic story. In a little warped town, known as Halloween town, lives Jack Skelington. Jack, aka the Pumpkin King, grows tired and bored of his role in the world, organizing Halloween each year. So, he goes in search of something new and different to do to end his slump. He discovers Christmas town, and decides he wants to do that instead. From the start, its pretty obvious that the citizens or Halloween town can't do Christmas and begin warping and dementing it totally out of recognition. there is also a sub plot about a patchwork girl who is also trying to escape her role in the world. She is falls in love with Jack from a far. Anymore and I would spoil it.The plot, simple fairy tale, a bit of human quality ie trying to escape the boring blue collar life. but, really the plot has very little to do with what makes this movie special. This is the very first movie to consist completely of stop motion. Probubly the most grueling film technique ever, stop motion requires small figures that are postioned then photographed then repositioned and rephotograped over and over. This process is  takes hours to create even a minute of footage. So, that exsplains alot about why each shot is so well crafted, since they spent weeks puting them together. This technique makes it very original, and very unique In a time when most movies were trying new computer animation and looking for a more realistic look. the filmmakers choice to go back to the herky jerky look of stop motion, was a bold and very different idea.Some of the things you will notice is there aren't really that many charactors. halloween town really has only about 10 or 15 residents, probably because the cost of creating hundreds of little firgures for every expression and movement they have. Jack alone probably had over 600 heads, for all the movements of his face. but, even with limitations like these, the movie succeeds in just about everything I think it set out to do. Its creepy and weird, scary and warped, yet has a kind of strange nice feeling. You have empathy for the charactors, even though they are dark and crazy. And if for no other reason, watch this movie for the cinematography. The sets are wonderful, the characters are cool looking, the music is great, and every shot is masterful. I find it easy just to forget the story and watch the pretty pictures.Is it a halloween spooky movie, or a warm christmas classic? who cares, its cool to watch!",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Reasonably entertaining,"Reasonably entertaining.Halloween has just come and gone and for Jack Skellington, the King of Halloweentown, it was the usual success. However, for Jack it is just more of the same, and is becoming boring. Then he stumbles across Christmastown...Reasonably good fun. I don't care about Halloween so much of the ghoulishness in the background was wasted on me. However, the whole ghouls-take-over-Christmas theme was quite original and lead to some quite funny moments. The music generally keeps the movie rollicking along and it is quite short, thus does not overstay its welcome.On the negative side, the plot does seem rather random and silly at times. Some scenes just go nowhere.Overall, more hit than miss, but it was close.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A good film; just don't expect a masterpiece,"I'd never seen this film until recently, although I'd heard a lot about it. After watching it, I can safely say that it has a dark tone to it, and yet also has a place for some degree of warmth. It's not a black-hearted or darkly spirited movie. It's a children's film. It's also a musical. A stop-motion musical with things that go bump in the night and their attempt at Christmas.I have to say that the imagery in the film is striking. The entire look of the piece is instantly memorable and the songs and dialogue and everything else really just come together in such a way that it's a complete vision being presented. The end result isn't a masterwork however. It lacks the resonance of a real masterpiece of expression, rather being more of a cute and enjoyable, even if limited, spectacle.This was clearly an inspired work, visually, but the story is a simple one: the pumpkin king finds his awesomeness in Halloween boring, discovers Christmasland and then the story proceeds from there. But the end impact of the film doesn't have a lot for Jack and the residents of Halloweentown and Jack is the only character that really develops (and not a whole lot).But it has a couple fun songs, plenty of wonderful visuals and doesn't particularly grate. Jack is the second best expressive stop-motion character that I've seen, after Nick Park's Gromit. A good film; just don't expect a masterpiece. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Warning - it's kind of a musical!,"My wife and two kids, boys aged 9 and 12, settled down together to watch this and at the halfway point we all agreed to bail on it.Part of the problem is that much of the explication is given in song, so unless you're on top of interpreting screechy singing voices you will be a bit lost.And I didn't really care about any of the characters ... there was a girl who was important somehow but I had no idea of what her motivation was. Her creator was a pretty good evil guy, though.My kids thought it was creepy, so I guess the film had some power, but just not the kind of power that would make us want to watch it.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Beyond nostalgic,"I was 10-yrs-old when this masterpiece was released and it left the most wonderful impression on me. I'm 40 now and this film is so embedded in my heart that I literally just started ugly crying when the last scene of Jack and Sally came on. The waves of nostalgia hit me so hard. As a child of the 90s, watching it for the first time, I'd never seen anything like it. It was magical. I'd always been fascinated with stop-motion and I was amazed by how the movie was made out of tangible materials. And on top of everything, I was obsessed with spooky, Halloween, ghostly things my entire childhood. Like, checking out every spooky book in the library, telling my cousins and friends ghost stories every chance I got.... obsessed. So this movie hit the mark for me in every way. I felt like it was made just for me. Tim Burton was a dream come true for a kid like me. The only other movie I'd seen that was comparable at the time was Beetlejuice, and I was in awe of that one too. What else is there to say? Tim Burton is a genius, and the collaboration with Danny Elfman who is also a genius... just out of this world magical. A match made in heaven (or hell in Burton's movies. Hehe) So amazing to hear Elfman's voice. Just beautiful. And Catherine O'Hara gave such an outstanding performance as well. This movie is perfection. 30 years later and, in many ways, it surpasses animation today. Burton payed such close attention to every detail. This film will never be outdated visually. And of course... the storyline has depth and is quite moving. This movie defines the expression ""total package"". And Jack Skellington is welcome to leave one on my doorstep any day. Now if only Burton would make a part 2... I would probably explode with joy. Oh well. A girl can dream...",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Elfman and Burton's Finest Partnership,"Tim Burton is one of only a few creative minds who's able to handle creepy, adult material in a way that's not just appropriate, but also downright appealing, to younger audiences. Beetlejuice, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure and Edward Scissorhands are all great examples of this trait at play, but of the lot I think this is his most timeless creation - which is odd, since it's the only one he didn't direct. Like the very best fairy tales, it's adventurous and unusual, taking outlandish concepts for granted as a means of sucking the audience into its own private corridor. The plot is predictable and natural, but also doesn't sacrifice its ability to throw the audience for a loop from time to time, and efficiently straddles two holidays in a manner that never feels forced or exploitative. Of course, the visuals are remarkable, bubbling with character, but the music is where it really hangs its hat. Danny Elfman has never felt more naturally at-home in the Burton universe, and considering the pair's long, storied history together, that's quite the achievement. The tunes are occasionally just a bit too catchy for their own good (I've been humming them for the better part of a day now) but that's a small price to pay for a modern fable this good.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
In my top 5 favorite movies of all time,"I have never liked stop-motion and clay things, but this is one of my favorite movies of all-time. The movie is so fluent, I couldn't tell it was stop-motion and obviously it is so beautifully done. Anywhere you look there is something to behold. Also, the characters look incredible and how they even move alone is really fascinating and cool. Jack moves a lot like a spider, and Sally is clumsy (like me!). It's so cool to just look at.Beside from visuals, the music/lyrics I believe are incredible. This is Halloween is so fun with clowns who can tear away their face and monsters hiding under your bed while remaining not frightening for children. Jack's Lament is such a wonderful song with a touching message we all know too well: getting tired of the same old thing. Oh, somewhere deep inside of these bones/An emptiness began to grow/There's something out there, far from my home/A longing that I've never known. Some lyrics from Jack's Lament (my favorite song in the movie.) When Sally sings her little song, I almost cry; it is so emotional. We established the songs are amazing.The plot is so original and creative; I can't helped to be drawled in. Who else would think of a Halloween Town person discovering Christmas other than Tim Burton? And the characters are some of the most interesting I've seen. Jack Skellington is so easy to relate to, lovable, and so determined, making him one of my favorite characters of all time. I'm not ashamed to admit I have a necklace of him. (: Sally is interesting too as well as with all the other characters.REALLY A MUST SEE!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993): Henry Selick's Masterpiece,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is a 1993 American stop-motion animated musical fantasy drama starring Danny Elfman, Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara, William Hickley, Ken Page, Paul Reubens, and Glenn Shadix.The Plot: Jack Skellington (Danny Elfman, Chris Sarandon), a resident from ""Halloween Town"" who stumbles through a portal to ""Christmas Town"" and decides to celebrate the holiday with disastrous consequences.The Nightmare Before Christmas was originally a poem written by Tim Burton in 1982, when Burton was working as an animator at Walt Disney Feature Animation. With the success of Burton's ""Vincent"" in the same year, Walt Disney Studios began to contemplate whether to release The Nightmare Before Christmas as a short film or a 30-minute TV Special. Many years passed, and Tim Burton developed thoughts about this project more and more over time. He made a deal with Disney in the year 1990. The production for the movie started in July of 1991 in San Francisco, California, USA. Disney decided to release the film through the Touchstone Pictures banner stating that they thought that The Nightmare Before Christmas would be ""too frightening for kids.""The film was a huge success, grossing $76.2 million over its theatrical run on a budget of $18,000,000.Danny Elfman's film score and his singing voice for Jack is absolutely amazing.This is for sure director Henry Selick's masterpiece and his best film. It was nominated the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, the first for an animated film.An absolute masterpiece and my favorite christmas movie and holiday movie of all-time.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

How Halloween twists the beauty of Christmas,"Even though this film was not directed by Tim Burton, I guess one should give him the credit for it as he helped write and also produced it. I guess the reason that he did not direct it was because it was an animated feature and he wanted to use a director that was far more skilled at animation than he was. In any case, this film still has a very Burton look to it with the twisted and dark scenery and the tragic characters. Even so, this movie is actually directed at children, and seems to be designed to introduce them to the world of the tragedy.The movie is about Jack Skelington, the Lord of Halloween Town. After a rather successful Halloween, he is depressed because he has lost all direction in life. All his life seems to be is haunting and scaring people at one time of the year, and even though the entire population of Halloween town looks up to him, he really does not want to do it anymore. In fact, he wants a career change.He thus goes on a walk out of Halloween town and finds a small grove of trees with doors in it. He enters the door shaped like a Christmas tree and finds himself in Christmas town. Upon seeing the wonders of this town, he decides that he wants to take over Christmas, so he has Santa kidnapped, and sets all of Halloween town to work to create his own Christmas. The problem is that Halloween town is not experienced and what they end up creating is a twisted and disturbing version of Christmas. This is the tragedy of this movie, Skelington seriously wishes to do something new, but ends up destroying the joy that the holiday was supposed to thing.I guess there is little in the way of themes in this movie with the exception of stick at what you are good at. But the movie is tragic in this sense because Jack Skelington has ended up doing what he has done because he has become bored and wishes to escape, but cannot. Even though the ending is happy, and Skelington gets the girl, there is still the underlying pain that Skelington is really back where he started, as when he tried to take over Christmas, he failed badly.This is a brilliant movie: the visuals and the music are superb. In fact, the music is by Danny Elfman, one of Burton's companions that seems to do the music for all of his films. It is a shame though that much of the population do not see the beauty behind Burton's films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Melting Disney's and Burton's styles (Christmas and Halloween).,"In this movie, we find the great style accomplished by Tim Burton in ""BeetleJuice"", with his musical alter ego Danny Elfman. This is really beautiful.The characters (I love the mad scientist), the humour, are good and typical from Burton. The plot is also pretty good, Some of it seems to have inspired the  ""Monsters Inc"" (The uglies are all in one world, with reversed values).Unfortunatly, the Disney's influence spoils the movie. SONGS ! Songs ! Songs ! A lot of songs. Too much of songs ! (boring, despite the fact I love the Elfman's music). And in contrary of ""Beetlejuice"" there is not a single moment with real fear. It's like ""Monsters Inc"", only for the kids. But ""Monsters Inc"", at least, had the good idea to avoid ""songs"" to reach the adult audience.The ""style"" remains the only reason  to watch this movie (for an adult). But this is a movie to watch, if you can keep a childhood spirit. Because I think this is more about ""Christmas"" than ""Halloween"" !6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas is a technical marvel.,"It is doubtful that you have ever experienced anything quite like it. Whether you'll like it or not, however, is a highly personal matter. It is 74 minutes of stop-motion animation, and that may prove to be 70 minutes too many for some. At first, it is fascinating to watch this brilliantly visual fairy tale unfurl. After the novelty wears off, however, there isn't all that much to rivet your attention. The music by immensely talented Danny Elfman grows wearisome, and the songs all sound pretty much alike. Just when you're about to doze off, however, another marvelous visual (such as a multicolored snake swallowing an aluminum Christmas tree) smacks you in the face, and you're hooked once again.The Nightmare Before Christmas tells the story of the Pumpkin King of Halloween Land, a skinny skeleton named Jack, who discovers Christmas Land quite by accident. This bright and cheerful sugar plum place is a far cry from Jack's dark world of ghouls and goblins. He is impressed and decides to make Christmas his own holiday. Santa Claus is kidnapped, and soon Jack is airborne in a sleigh guided by Zero, the red-nosed ghost dog, delivering gifts to kiddies around the world. Too bad some of these toys bite back and are scaring the wee ones out of their wits. Will Jack come to his senses in time to save Christmas? Will Santa be saved? Will Jack finally take notice of the adoring Sally, a rag-doll version of the Bride of Frankenstein? Will young children have nightmares after seeing The Nightmare Before Christmas?

The Nightmare Before Christmas is an excellent Christmas movie that is truly unique.,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is a wonderful stop-motion film from 1993. The director of the film is Tim Burton. He creates a dreamlike world that is truly unique. The story takes place in a town called Halloween Town. It is filled with monsters, vampires, werewolves, and other scary deformed creatures. It is a dark and creepy looking movie, yet it isn't the slightest bit scary. Burton does a great job of making scenes humorous when they're getting suspenseful.The main roll is a man named Jack Skellington, who leads the town to celebrate Halloween. He eventually gets tired of his everyday life style and seeks something new and different. Jack wonders off and finds these doors with different holiday symbols on them. He opens the door with a Christmas tree on it and he gets pulled in. This town is completely opposite of the town he has known his whole existence. Christmas town is happy, colorful, and everyone is cheerful. Jack quickly goes home to Halloween town to share his experience he had with the town. Later in the movie he tries to capture ""Sandy Clause"" and bring him to Halloween Town to take over Christmas.This film has excellent camera angles for being filmed in 1993 and being a stop- motion film. The lighting that is used throughout the film is High Key Lighting. Many of the scenes are shot in darkness or in silhouette. This adds to the dark situation the film is portraying. In one particular scene Jack is climbing a mountain and his silhouette appears on the huge moon behind him. This makes Jacks character seem large and powerful. The motions of the characters are seamless and entertaining.Overall this is a very enjoyable film that is intended for almost everyone. The non diegetic sound throughout the film is excellent. Each song is catchy and you can't help but sing along. The animation of the characters and scenery are original and fun to look at it. Watching the film, I never even noticed it was stop motion.

It ranges in style from the 1920's Kurt Weill- Bertolt Brecht adaptations (right down, on occasion, to the rhythm banjo and mournful alto sax), to the Russian composers, Tchaikovsky, Prokofiev, and Shostakovich, all done with a sense of humor and homage that keeps it fresh, unlike, say, Kander and Ebb, who keep writing Weill-Brecht material to the point that there's more of their music in that particular style than there is by Weill, who figured out by the 1930's that it would only go so far, and who wrote some of the great tunes of the American theatre, as well as the incredible and underrated opera ""Street Scene.""Elfman is a film composer whose work ranks with the best of (and this is high praise, indeed, coming from me) John Williams, Bernard Herrmann, and Erich Wolfgang Korngold. Even if this weren't a wonderful movie to watch (and it is) it would be a wonderful movie to hear.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
It's a musical though...,Man I have had this film on me list for years... I love stop/go and Tim Burton is coolMaybe I'm dumb but didn't know it was a musical. I did try but musicals don't do it at all for me. I hate them. 6 is a good score from me for a musical,6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A bit bizarre to say the least.,"I saw this film on the 23rd of December. It is now the 18th of January and I still don't know what to think of it. On the one hand, the stop motion techniques are brilliantly done and the voice cast works well together. Even the peculiar songs from the film are quite catchy.But then again it is a bit too dark and sometimes, downright creepy to be considered a Christmas movie. The characters are unique and it is cleverly written, but it is very cold hearted and probably won't appeal to the young.I still have mixed feelings but many of the other users seem to have enjoyed the film.

The best from Tim Burton,"I remember seeing previews for this movie and thinking it looked stupid. The closer it got to the opening, I changed my mind. Then I saw the film and fell in love with it. I had never seen anything like it. It is wonderful! The script is great, the acting and singing are great, the stop action is great. And it is quite humorous. I cannot gush enough about this movie.My favorite character was Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King. He has a great idea, he just didn't know how to make it work. I also liked the love story between him and Sally the rag doll. From the beginning you can tell that she is in love with Jack; he does not realize his feelings (or hers) until the end. And the Oogie Boogie scenes are a hoot to watch! This movie also has addicting and memorable songs such as 'This is Halloween,' 'What's This?,' and 'Kidnap the Sandy Claws.' You will be singing them for a week after!If you haven't seen this movie, see it. It is a must for Halloween and the holiday season. As I said before, I cannot gush enough about this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
You Will Love the Nightmare,"Jack Skellington, aka the Pumpkin King, is a skeleton who is in charge of planning out Halloween. He lives in a place called Halloween Town which is inhabited by ghouls and monsters who eagerly count each day until the next Halloween. Jack longs for something different and discovers Christmas which is ironically the polar opposite of Halloween. Jack and the rest of Halloween Town decide to give Christmas a try. Underneath the main plot of taking over Christmas, there is a love story between Jack and Sally. Sally is a creation of the Evil Scientist. She also longs for something different just as Jack does, but feels his plan will not work.The visual aspect of Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas is probably what it is most remembered for. This is the first movie to consist entirely of stop motion animation. Stop motion animation is one of the hardest things to do, and it takes a very long time. You would have figures or something else and you would take a picture of them. Then you would move them slightly and take another picture. You would repeat this over and over. I believe each second of the film is about 24 pictures. Different images, such as Jack and Sally on the hill, will stay with you for the rest of your life. The music by Danny Elfman is another factor which makes this movie great. Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas is an excellent movie for all ages.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Tim Burton directing, need I say more?","Of all Tim Burton's movies (excepting Vincent) this would still have to be his crowning glory. What I love most is the in-depth characterization of the models. From their physical appearance, to the way they speak even including their movement each character is a true individual. Along with Danny Elfman's musical genius which has also produced the fabled Simpsons theme tune and many other ""uknown"" television and movie song, this truly is a movie for the ages. I highly recommend it for anyone who has twisted sense of humour or a good sense of fun. Everyone can enjoy the colourful characters of Halloween town and the soft heart that lies even in the chests of Monsters and Ghoul and, of course, Skeletons.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
One Of The Most Creative Movies Ever Made.,"When I was a kid, I was sheltered and I couldn't watch a lot of movies and TV shows that my classmates could. One movie that intrigued me was The Nightmare Before Christmas, which was brought to my attention from a trailer on my VHS of Pinocchio. (That shows my age, huh? I was born in 1998!)Anyways, I couldn't see it when I was little, because my parents were convinced that I would find it too scary. When I was about 11, my Mom gave me permission to see the climax on TV, but I tried to see it from the start when I was 14, and was literally shaking as the ""This Is Halloween"" number played. I then turned it off soon after.Within the next year, I moved in with my Grandma, and I tried it again, and I instantly fell in love with it. Ever since, I have seen it over a dozen times in a decade, partly thanks to one of my cousins giving me a DVD of it for Christmas one year.The plot, based on a poem that Tim Burton wrote, follows Jack Skellington, a skeleton who rules Halloween Town, but is bored of a life of scaring people every October 31st. This repetitive life depresses him, until he finds the world of Christmas Town, and he plans to steal it and make it his own.The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of the most creative movies ever made, and much of this comes from the animation. Using the stop-motion method, where dolls are filmed frame by frame to give the illusion that they are moving, there is much to be in awe of, such as how the characters move, or their designs.In fact, you appreciate the animation style even more when you know that it took 1 week to animate a full minute of the movie, meaning it took well over a year just to animate this movie!The Nightmare Before Christmas also has numerous catchy songs. This Is Halloween is one of them, of course, but other tunes include What's This?, The Oogie Boogie Song, my favorite- Kidnap The Sandy Claws, and more.Some are more for drama, like Sally's Song (sung after Jack leaves in his sleigh) and Jack's Lament (the 2nd song in the movie) and Poor Jack (the song that comes after Jack ruins Christmas), and while these are not my favorite songs in the movie, they still work for their context.The Nightmare Before Christmas also has an impressive voice cast, with actors from other Tim Burton productions. His composer Danny Elfman voices Jack's singing voice, Barrel, and The Clown With A Tear Away Face. Catherine O'Hara of Beetlejuice voices Sally and the witch girl Shock. Paul Ruebens, aka Pee Wee Herman, voices Lock, and Glenn Shadix- Otho in Beetlejuice, voices The Mayor.There is also impressive talent from Chris Sarandon (Susan Sarandon's husband) as Jack's speaking voice, William Hickey (Lewis from National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation) as Dr. Finklestein- Sally's creator, and Ken Page as The Oogie Boogie Man, who also voices the alligator in All Dogs Go To Heaven, another one of my favorite animated movies.These elements- the creativity, animation, songs, and casting, are among some of the top reasons to see The Nightmare Before Christmas.While it will probably be a nightmare for the very young, The Nightmare Before Christmas is still a very creative and impressive film, and one to cherish for the ages. It's one of my absolute favorite Disney movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"I liked Beetlejuice, but.....","this Burton movie is the most visually attractive. The songs are addictive;""What's This?"", the first song that goes..""...this is Holloween, this is Holloween"", and the one when the three kids kidnap 'Sandy Claws'. What's great is the lighting, the eerieness of the main characters, shown in a kind of beautiful way.I first saw this when I was 13 and had the biggest crush on Jack...I think I still do....I don't know why!!! I know, issues...=)Anyway, think of the eerie quality that Burton used for Gotham City in the Batman sequel, and that's how effective the lighting and all the extras are to the story.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A review written for anyone who didn't grow up with this movie.,"I'll just put it this way: I didn't grow up on The Nightmare Before Christmas and, honestly, viewing it now, I don't get why it's so hyped up. I can understand how someone who saw it in their childhood, or even someone who saw it when it first came out, would consider it classic, but for someone who didn't, it just seems forgettable. I saw The Corpse Bride before seeing this, and I thought it was better in every way imaginable.I'm not going to smash childhood memories and trash the film, because, really, there is nothing wrong with it. It's imaginative and fun, with a great plot and interesting characters. Unlike Tim Burton's live-action movies, there is very few clichÃ©s. The fantasy word he creates is rich, vivid, and unlike any other.Now why I didn't like it:For 1993, the animation was top notch. For 2008, anyone first coming into this movie is going to think it looks pathetic, which I did. It just takes you away from the overall experience. On an animation scale, comparing this to Wall-E is like comparing The Blob to Transformers. It's such a huge gap, it's almost impossible to ignore.It lacks a high entertainment value. Why? I don't really know, but I have read other reviews that agree with me. Maybe it would have been better if it wasn't a musical.Except for a few songs, a lot of the songs just aren't . . . good. Some of them even felt gimmicky and there to characterize (such as Oogie Boogie's song). The majority of the songs are just unnecessary and don't drive the plot or characterization whatsoever.Overall, being someone who literally just saw this movie for the first time a few hours ago, I was let down. I can understand why people who grew up with it would love it, but those people also need to understand why people who didn't may not enjoy it as much. I personally prefer animated children's horror such as Monster House over this because it has higher entertainment value.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Worlds In Collision,"Another collision of the Burton visual world vs. the Elfman musical world.Here, by giving directorial control away, Burton's vision suffers an irretrievable loss of focus.Halloween, of course, has no musical narrative to accompany it...so all we as a society have are movie ideas (Rocky Horror, all the monster features) to hold it together. Before movies, all we had were literary ones (Frankenstein, Bram Stoker). This is Burton's home world, lacking real people, but encompassing 'puppets controlled by minds'-- a world of art.Fundamentally, Christmas is a musical world -- Elfman's milieu -- just think of any Christmas song and all the imagery you need is there. The literary/movie narratives just accrete and grow bigger each year, a 'snowball'. In modern times, the exterior has been all crass commercialism -- the visuals rooted in musical notions ('jingles').The collision is oil vs. water -- you can shake it, but eventually the mixture separates. Burton, the Pumpkin King, has to resign to his fate. This is the necessary essay before the successful marriage achieved in ""Corpse Bride"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Timeless classic,"Tim Burton/Henry Selick's The Nightmare Before Christmas is very special in the sense that it can be re-watched and apreciated at both halloween and Christmas, which I always do. It's such a classic that it's catchy songs, distinct characters and boundless imagination have ingrained it into the collective consciousness of pop culture for eternity. It paved the roads of animation with its innovative, eye candy stop motion animation (my favorite style) and lit up the musical genre with its crowd pleasing ballads of pure holiday joy. By now anyone who hasn't seen this and doesn't know the plot really needs to rethink their life choices, but for those few lost souls who haven't seen it, I'll go I'll to the plot a bit, because I love talking about it. In a far off fantasy realm called Halloweentown, the residents toil endlessly all year for their annual festivities. They're a wide variety of whacky creatures, including werewolves, bicycle riding clowns, witches, ghouls sand so many more. A gaunt, spindly gentleman called Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon, with Danny Elfman seamlessly providing his singing voice) is the top dog in Halloweentown, the 'Pumpkin King'. But he yearns for more, and laments the mundane, everyday slog of halloween. On a forest walk he discovers portals to the other holiday realms, and unwittingly tumbles headlong into Christmas Town, with his ghostly dog Zero. We then are treated to one of the most charming sequences in any animated film ever, as he discovers an adorable host of elves, reindeer, snow, and all kinds of brightly lit festive delight that he's never seen before, as he excitedly belts out my favourite number of the piece, 'What's This?'. In his elation, he hatches a plan to kidnap Santa Claus and use him to spruce up his hometown and give it that Christmas cheer for fora change. Of course his scheme backfires in hilarious, poignant ways and he learns along the way. He's joined by Sally the rag doll (Catherine O Hara), and the neurotic Mayor of Halloweentown (Glenn Shadix) as well as a whole impressively designed host of creatures too numerous to name here, some of my favourites being the mischievous Lock, Shock and Barrel, as well as villainous Oogie Boogie. The film is pure magic, with song after song stirring your heart and sticking in your mind long after ft er the credits. This Is Halloween, Making Christmas, The Oogie Boogie song to name a few are pure gold. If there's ever after terrestrial cinematic time capsule fpr generations down the road to unearth among the rubble, this one has top priority for a spot. It's simply magic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"A great, fun, and addictive film.","The first time I saw this movie back in 93', I didn't like it that much. Then, a year ago, I viewed it again and my eyes were opened to one of the most charming, catchy, fun, artistically brilliant films I've EVER seen. The animation is absolutely uncanny. It marvelously sets a mood that has no equal. Danny Elfman, one of my favorite composers, really busts his butt to pull the music and lyrics off and he succeeds gloriously. One of the most exquisitely composed movies of all time. I know ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is only an hour and fifteen minutes, but it certainly seem much longer than that. That is because there is not a dull moment in the whole movie. It dares not to take take a breath and slow down. Like the Energizer Bunny, it keeps going, and going, and going. I cannot stress enough how much eye candy the film contains. I wish I could have seen this on the big screen, it would have been quite a visual experience. Tim Burton's style is apparent throughout, and there's not much lame, sentimental, Disney-esque stuff in it. What is there is a small ozone layer of warmth that envelops the whole package and delivers an original, heart-warming, and visually breath-taking masterpice of cinema. It is, and will continue to be a classic of epic proportions. A masterpiece.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Has every right to be considered a movie milestone.,"We've seen quite a bit of stop-motion animation on television, with all of those holiday specials we see every Christmas, and of course, the infamous Wallace and Gromit shorts by filmmaker Nick Park in the U.K. However, in the 1990s, we haven't seen a whole lot of stop-motion animation on the big screen. In fact, we rarely saw that. However, one little film came to theatres in 1993 produced by ""Batman"" director Tim Burton and directed by then-newcomer Henry Selick (who would later make ""Coraline"") that really caught our attention. That film was ""Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas"".The movie focuses around Jack Skellington, the king of Halloween, who is tired of doing the same old celebration in Halloween Town year after year, as illustrated and interpreted in the film's second musical number. That's right. This is a musical. He wanders out of Halloween Town to find something new, until he stumbles upon a series of holiday doors in the middle of the forest. The one that catches his eye is a door in the shape of a tree. A Christmas tree as a matter of fact. He opens the door, only to be literally sucked in and discovers Christmas town. Fascinated by his discovery, he tells the citizens of Halloween Town all about it, and comes up with the idea of taking over Christmas this year. What happens after that I will not tell, because there are a certain number of people who have not even seen this fantastic movie yet.Let me make it clear, if the 10/10 score isn't clear enough already if you looked under the summary. I absolutely love this movie. A lot. In fact, it's within the top 10 of my all time favorite movies list (which I have not fully completed yet). Every year since I've gotten the Special Edition DVD at age 15, I've watched this movie numerous times every year, and it still has not gotten old. Even though I never got the opportunity to watch this movie at a younger age (for some reason -.-), waiting until I got my hands on the DVD disc paid off nicely. The structure of the sets and characters are absolutely brilliant and morbid for a stop-motion picture. A lot of care went into the making of this motion picture milestone, even if Tim Burton was absent most of the time. The reason for that was he was directing ""Batman Returns"" for Warner Brothers and he was also in pre-production for the R-rated drama ""Ed Wood"", which would also be released by Touchstone. So, because of this, it was director Henry Selick's job to make sure that Tim Burton's vision was alive and well during production. The result, a movie that defined the mind of Tim Burton as a whole.The music and songs, both done by former Oingo-Boingo front man and film composer Danny Elfman are also the highlight of the film besides the animation and visuals. There are 10 songs in total, and they are performed brilliantly. Danny Elfman also provides the singing voice of Jack Skellington. The music is celebrated to the point where in 2008, Walt Disney Records released a compilation album entitled ""Nightmare Revisited"", with all the songs and motion picture score performed by popular and independent acts, including the likes of Marilyn Manson, Korn, Rise Against, and the All-American Rejects (don't worry parents, it's family-friendly). Bizarre as it is, the compilation is definitely worth a buy if you love the film as much as I do.Today, 20 years later as of this review post, the film still holds up really well. Merchandise went up the wazoo, video games were made, and it even garnered a cult following. Whether you are watching it in 2D or 3D, chances are, you're gonna get the same reaction of amazement on how far we've gotten with filmmaking technology. Back then, animated films didn't solely rely on computer generated images to wow audiences. Craftsmanship and imagination were needed to make a film that can captivate the movie-going public. Granted, this doesn't always mark every single film a success, but in this case, it's what made it a classic. The film may have a few faults, which are really very small nitpicks, but it does not hurt the film one bit. This movie is still fun to watch, and it can be best viewed on Halloween and Christmas. That's right. It's not just a Christmas movie. It's a Halloween treat as well. If you haven't seen this film once in your life, you owe it to yourself to find a DVD/Blu-Ray copy of this movie. If you have kids, it's even better.Before I end this review, I must mention that Disney first released this film under their more adult subsidiary Touchstone Pictures, because they thought the movie would be too scary for younger audiences. In fact, it's what got it the PG rating. Ironically, this is the same studio that released a lesser known horror film called ""The Watcher in the Woods"". What they didn't realize is that kids eat this stuff up like Halloween candy. It wouldn't be until the 3D re-release when Disney themselves would distribute the film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Strange and Beautiful at the same time.,"I infinitely enjoyed Nightmare Before Christmas. While it is not for everyone, anyone who is into something truly unique should check out this movie. If the fact that movie genius Tim Burton was involved in this movie did NOT spark your attention, then please continue to read.The story in a nutshell: Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king of Halloweentown (with a speaking voice of Chris Sarandon) is depressed. He is growing bored with scaring people and now wants to try something different. This is when Jack comes to a fantastic place--Christmas Town. The idea of Christmas excites Jack, which eventually leads to the kidnapping of Santa Claus (or ""Sandy Claws"" as the Halloween populace calls him). Without giving spoilers, let's just say that things don't go quite as well as Jack planned.This story, while it might sound a bit cheesy on paper to some people, is pulled off beautifully. The humor is stuck in a very subtle way and despite their appearances, you will grow to love these characters. The wonderfully composed soundtrack doesn't hurt either.The first song, ""This is Halloween"" does a perfect job of introducing the townspeople of Halloweentown. It also opens up in a flashy way (that's in a GOOD flashy way though). The slick stop-motion animation pulls you right in, including ghosts carrying packages and wind blowing through a rag-doll's hair (the rag-doll being Jack's love interest, Sally, voiced by Catherine O'Hara). Then within less than 10 minutes of the movie, the problem of the story is revealed.""Jack's Lament"", which is gorgeously sung by Danny Elfman (who also happened to compose the soundtrack to this movie) describes Jack's problem perfectly. ""What's This"" is a polar opposite of the lament, bursting with joy. Danny Elfman excellently portrays Jack's anguish here and through out the rest of the movie.The other voices are nicely done as well, from the vocals in the seemingly morbid song ""Kidnap the Sandy Claus"" (sung by a trio of twisted youngsters) to the Las Vegas styled ""Oogie Boogie Song"" to the sad ""Sally's Song"". The lyrics in this music (lyrics are also written by Danny Elfman)can range from witty to pure poetry. Don't be surprised if you find yourself singing the songs yourself--they are THAT good.So all in all, a must watch. Buy it or rent it now. You will definitely not regret it.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Probably Burton's best film.,Yes this is a Burton's film. Yes I am aware that he was not the director. But as the producer and the creator of the story and characters he had a singular impact on the final product. More to the point it feels like a Burton film. In fact it feels like THE Burton film. It has all of his hallmarks in design and atmosphere. It even has his typical weakness in story and narrative. This is the film I would show to someone experiencing Burton for the first time.

Pure movie magic about seeking new possibilities,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is simply pure movie magic. Its stop- motion animation entertains with a seemingly effortless ease, though quite a lot of painstaking artistry was required to bring the world of Jack Skellington to life. It's the story of Jack, the ""Pumpkin King,"" who is essentially the physical embodiment of the spirit of Halloween. After yet another successful Halloween, Jack wanders away from town with his dog Zero, tired of the holiday he has mastered and seeking a new sense of purpose. He stumbles into ""Christmas Town"" and decides to give the people of Halloween Town a new project. Though not overtly political, Nightmare has a progressive quality, both in terms of the daring vision it brings to the screen and in its themes. It's a film about struggling against the boundaries of your environment and pressing for change. And even though Jack's attempt to usurp Christmas is misguided and ultimately unsuccessful, he's not wrong to seek new possibilities, and he emerges from the experience a changed skeleton. He's revived and renewed, and with the help of Sally, who loves Jack for who he is, he realizes his ambition was driven by selfishness. In the end, he's wiser, having learned to play his own role well without descending into isolation. After setting things right, Jack is better able to listen to, collaborate with, and connect with others for the benefit of everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"It's fun to watch, but can feel underwhelming at times!","This is another detailed, intrguing stop-motion picture that is very enjoyable to watch. The intricate details and the coloring of the whole movie makes this such a good one to watch. While I do enjoy the simple plot, one of my main problems with this movie is how it wasn't explored more, and how it kept on losing my interest. Now don't get me wrong, where credit is due, I give credit: the amazing details and animations are gorgeous, and I would just see this movie for just that, but this stop-motion picture can come off lame and boring. Not that I want it to, but it doesn't help some of the music score is slow, and could put you to sleep and the story is simple but underwhelming. My big complaint for this really is how we barely explored this amazing world; trust me, I want to explore this with all the amazing, visual details!

Brilliant concept beautifully executed.,"This movie is brilliant. It isn't just a family film in that it's isn't just for kids or the PG crowd.

If you don't let your kid out on Halloween then fine don't let them see this. Go back to your 24hr brain-wash coddle fest. Stick to Barney and most of the Disney catalog.But if you like to feed you and your child's imagination GO SEE THIS MOVIE!This is the Disney movie that Disney rightfully should not claim as their own. However, it is more Disney in spirit than any Disney film produced in the past twenty years.It is innovative and original. Disney is not anymore. Only productions made outside of their creative stranglehold are any good. (This and the Toy Story movies).Visually, this has to be the most original animated movie ever. Only Tim Burton could of done this and thank god he did.I have watched this movie about ten times and every time I find something new. Something you parents might want to keep in mind, when your child wants to watch this again.I usually hate songs in movies but these are catchy and kind of sarcastic so they aren't the dreaded formulaic - bad - Broadway wannabe- bathroom break - catnaps that are usually present in EVERY Disney animated movie of the last 11 years.This movie drips with creativity and heart. Down to the tiniest detail you can tell the animators put their soul into this. Instead of the assembly line animation of Disney's latest merchandising juggernaut.If you like Tim Burton see this. If you are tired of being patronized by Disney see this. If your kid has any kind of imagination and intelligence, shut off the Lion King and make them see this.Note: DVD has a great picture and sound and is the best way to appreciate this landmark and classic animated film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Fresh, fun, exciting, all those positive adjectives that a movie should be","This is a very special film on several levels. On a personal level, this is the first movie I ever truly fell in complete love with as a child. On a technical level, ""Nightmare"" is really an achievement because making a 76 minute film with claymation in 1993 probably was a nightmare comparable to what the production crew of ""Jaws"" faced. On a musical level, this is the best movie-musical of all time, in my opinion. Danny Elfman's score is one of the best ever written. Also, this is a milestone film in terms of story and characters. If ""Nightmare"" were filmed in live-time without the music, it wouldn't have the magic that put it #3 on my list, but it would still be a well developed, quirky story. As I say in every review, the most important part of film a film is its character development and its finale. Henry Selick and Tim Burton take characters that seem very unlikeable and make them personable. I actually think that the humble love story between Jack and Sally is the most romantic love story in film history. It's innocent. The entire film is innocent. A child could sit down and appreciate this film as I did, or an adult could do the same. It's colorful in a literal sense and a figurative sense. Also, ""Nightmare"" has the greatest opening sequence of all time, in my opinion. ""This is Halloween"" is undeniably creepy, and all of our Halloween archetypes spring to life before our eyes, promising an exciting hour and 15 minutes. Boogie is one of the most delicious villains of all time. He's just so rotten, you have to love him. His song with Santa Claus is priceless--there's something about the boogeyman singing a jazz number to Santa Claus that fills me with glee. Despite the darkness of the Halloween theme, Burton and Selick bring unimaginable beauty to the screen. Christmas town is straight from a child's (or Tim Burton's) dreams. The ending is also beautiful, but we won't talk about that in a review. The whole point of going to the films is to be taken somewhere that you can't really go.

Gets Better with Age,"When this film was released in 1993 Disney Distant themselves from this. They removed the ""Walt Disney"" presents from the credits and released it under their TOUCHSTONE picture label. The reality is they had no idea that they had one of the best films the studio has ever released.Tim Burton was the executive producer of this film. He came up with the idea. However in 1992 he released ""Batman Returns"" and that film got major backlash for the dark tone it had/ ""The Night Before Christmas"" has a dark tone to it but it is very very funny. Most of all it has the best original scores to ever be made for a film.In this film Halloween Town, is a dream world filled with citizens such as deformed monsters, ghosts, ghouls, goblins, vampires, werewolves and witches. Jack Skellington (""The Pumpkin King"") leads them in a frightful celebration every Halloween, but he has grown tired of the same routine year after year. Wandering in the forest outside the town center, he accidentally opens a portal to ""Christmas Town."" Impressed by the feeling and style of Christmas, Jack presents his findings and his (somewhat limited) understanding of the festivities to the Halloween Town residents. They fail to grasp his meaning and compare everything he says to their idea of Halloween. He reluctantly decides to play along and announces that they will take over Christmas.Things go wrong very fast when Jack start delivering his idea of Christmas Toys.After the film was released on Home Video the film really started to gained a foothold on audiences. Once they saw it ""They loved it"". Then Disney finally put there name on the film after the film became such an icon of not only ""Halloween"" but ""Christmas"" as well.The film is so well made and it is never boring. The songs in this film are very catchy.Not exactly a huge hit when it was released in 1993 the film however has gone on to be a best seller on home video every year!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

A milestone in animation and Christmas movies,"I was a child when I first saw this movie. My father has always been a big fan of Tim Burton, and he couldn't wait to show me this on our brand new VHS. I didn't understand the movie at first because I was so young, and for years I didn't appreciate how much effort went in here. Now that I have actually developed taste, I can share with you my opinion on this revolutionary masterpiece.The plot of ""Nightmare"" is based on the Tim Burton poem of the same name. It's about a Skeleton named Jack who is the king of HalloweenTown, a place where the only holiday is Halloween. Every time the celebrations end up the same, and the whole year is spent preparing for the next Halloween. Jack, being in charge of all this, gets bored and decides that he is no longer going to bother with Halloween. He travels away from town with his ghost dog, Zero, much to the town's dismay.After days of travelling, Jack discovers a group of doors, each one acting as a portal to the different towns representing each holiday. Intrigued, he opens the door the ChristmasTown, and discovers his new favourite holiday. Jack returns triumphantly to HalloweenTown, telling everyone (through the medium of a song) to prepare for something new and exciting: Christmas. As one would expect, the people of HalloweenTown have rather dark visions of Christmas, and with an evil monster named Oogie Boogie in the mix, something's bound to go wrong! The whole movie is brilliantly presented in traditional stop-motion animation, with all 227 character models looking as they should; either bright and colourful Christmas workers or spooky Halloween creeps. Every character, however scary, is lovable from start to finish The music is pure genius and each line falls on top of the backing like brandy on a pudding. Danny Elfman does a great job as Jack's singing voice, which is expected considering he wrote the songs and therefore knows exactly how they should sound.Considering all these great elements of a movie, I would definitely dub it as a must-see and my favourite Christmas movie of all time. I watch it every Christmas Eve and will no doubt do so for years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Disney 3D version good but not great,While we put our feet up and watch our DVD of this great movie a least once toward the end of each year. We thought it would be great to see it on Halloween this year (2006) on the big screen in the digitally remastered 3D version. The film opens with some new and startling computer generated 3D graphics that is right in your face - as good 3D should be. Then the main feature starts of the remastered movie. It is flat to the screen but has depth going back - kind of like it was happening in a fish tank the front of which is a screen away. The film only leaps out at you on one or two occasions. A little disappointing But this is one hell of a movie that is a lot of fun in 2 or 3D.,6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Even skeletons never die,"I don't know a single person who doesn't love this movie. Tim Burton nailed this one in my eyes, and this is the movie that introduced my generation to him and to claymation as well. I was very young when this movie came out, and yes it scared me but it was the greatest movie ever. This the go-to movie when it's time for Halloween, and Christmas as well, to get you in the spirit! The soundtrack is gold and every song is fantastic and you know most of the words from the first time you see it. It has been almost 20 years since it came out and it still has a cult following, a mega franchise and screaming fans of all ages. Disney was right to pick up the rights for this movie because I guarantee you it has done nothing but given them more money for years to come.

"RUNNING TIME - 76 minutes STARRING -  Danny Elfman, Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara and Ken Page CERTIFICATE - PG","Jack Skellington is Halloween Town's equivalent of Santa Claus. After years of the same spooky Town's holiday, Jack craves adventure and becomes depressed because of his tiresome attitude. After one particular Halloween, Jack stumble into a new part of the forest where he observes a circle of trees, each with a holiday printed upon its door. Fascinated by the door with the decorated tree, which glows in front of him, Jack enters Christmas Town in search of his wish. He is so bewildered and confused by his experience that he stretches to science to understand the concept of joy and laughter and Christmas. The only one who sees through Jack's crazy ideas is the unique Sally who loves Jack but fails to help him see sense. Jack resorts to the twisted idea of taking Christmas and making it his own. The ending is beautifully inevitably but involves Jack fixing what he destroyed and rescuing Santa Claus, who was rudely kidnapped by the Oogie Boogie Man.The Nightmare before Christmas is my all-time favourite movie. The animation is filled with unforgettable songs and music by Danny Elfman. The story is simple yet stunning and no one can help falling in love with each and every character in Halloween Town. The opening is a narration that prepares the audience to an extent that there is little that could draw them away from the screen.What struck me as awesome about the music is how every song or instrumental section is vaguely variated on another which quite subtly warms you the songs before you even hear them. The most genius tune is the simple construction of Sally's song, which has various variations throughout the movie.The only real complaint is that it is a very short film...but over-all that seems to be a positive quality as it has not failed to impress from my experience. Each scene is quite magically presented in true Tim Burton style.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Exquisitely-detailed ghoul-fest,"Stop-motion animation technique brings life to tale of Halloweentown, whose residents get bitten by the Christmas bug and move into Santa's territory. Co-producer Tim Burton, who also conceived the story, obviously loved the Rankin/Bass holiday specials from television, smoothly updating those productions with modern razzle-dazzle, creating amusingly ghoulish creatures who glide across the screen fluidly. The only area of the film that needed strengthening was the story, which falls flat in places and is particularly mean to poor Santa Claus (although kids didn't much notice or care). Henry Selick's direction is lively and Danny Elfman (the singing voice of the Pumpkin King) composed a wonderful song-score. Fun for game adults and older children. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

An all time favorite,"I can't accurately explain how I feel about this film. Easily one of Burton's finest, Nightmare tells the tale of Jack Skellington, the unspoken ruler of Halloween Town. Jack, the Pumpkin King, has tired of the yearly celebration for which the town owns its name, and longs for something more. On a long, lonely night, he literally stumbles upon Christmas Town, filled with lights and pleasant sounds and completely absent of death. On his return to Halloween Town, Jack, enchanted by this new place, attempts to explain its splendor to the rest of Halloween Town. It is lost on almost all of them, except for the lovelorn Sally, who longs to be closer to Jack. Eventually, the town's inhabitants come around and, in response to Jack's request, make Christmas theirs for the year. Danny Elfman and Tim Burton never disappoint, and the marriage of Elfman's music and voice with Burton's production is nothing short of magical. The characters--the confused leader Jack, the hopeful and lost Sally, the villainous Oogie Boogie, and (perhaps most delightful of all) Boogie's cronies Lock, Shock, and Barrel, to name a few--are beautifully fleshed out and entertaining beyond description. This film takes you in and does not lose you its full running time. It is one to go back to again and again; there's always something new to pick up on, a twist you hadn't quite caught. A children's film, and yet considerably darker and more mature, The Nightmare Before Christmas can catch anyone's eye, no matter how old or young they are. I'd recommend this to, well, the world at large.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
We All Want To Try Something Different.,"Tim Burton's ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" was an enjoyable, poetic and musical film.And it was more than what I expected, I just thought it was probably a Christmas that went upside down for no reason. When in fact, the creatures from Halloween Town decided to do Christmas instead of Halloween. And the results, were shocking! LOL! There were so many shocks and scares on such a jolly occasion.The movie impressed me when I saw all the holiday occasions: Valentine's Day, Easter, Christmas and Halloween. This impressed me because, this was how Jack the Pumpkin King got to see what Christmas was about, behind that Christmas door, there was a blazing Jack O'Lantern for a sun in Halloween Town and ""Lamp O' Lanterns"" for lam-posts. And, a Boogey man who likes to Boogey in that glowing lair of his.If you are studying animation, I suggest you watch ""behind the scenes"".

One of my favorite movies of all time!,"I have watched this movie every Halloween since it came out. Some great quotable lines (""And...frog's breath!"")...amazing songs (what else would you expect from Danny Elfman?)and truly unique characters. While Toy Story and other animated movies may have generated more box office success, they shouldn't have. The set design, animation and storyline make this a top-notch production. I absolutely love this movie. It's great for the whole family. My wife and I watch it while carving pumpkins each Halloween. It's a tradition! There may be some scenes that are a little too scary for very young ones. But kids 8 and up will absolutely love it. The storyline has Jack Skellington, the hero of Halloween, deciding to spice things up this year by trying his bony hand at Christmas. So, with good intentions he has Santa Claus kidnapped and Jack sets off to give Christmas a unique twist this year. Only problem is, no one is ready for a Skeleton Claus in a thin red suit and fake beard. Not to mention the horrifying gifts left under the tree! Jack's nemesis, Oogie Boogie is a great character and provides one of the most memorable songs/scenes in the movie. You'll have to watch it to find out how Jack saves Christmas!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The movie that captures the spirit of Halloween,"This movie is timeless. Tim Burton brings his original characters to life in this twisted romantic story. The plot follows Jack Skellington, The Pumpkin King, as he struggles to find happiness and struggles with the contrast between good and evil. Instead of reforming Halloween, he tries to steal Christmas and the joy that comes along with it. The love interest and daughter of the evil scientist, Sally, tries to show Jack that happiness doesn't have to come from a holiday. The movie does a great job of highlighting that it is hard to find happiness in all the evil that surrounds Halloween. Together, there is hope off-screen that Jack and Sally can reform Halloween and make it a more joyous holiday. The flow of the story was fast at times; a larger run-time would have done the film justice. The movie's theme is about finding joy but also listening to our loved ones and not getting in our own way. If Jack had listened to Sally sooner, he would have been able to understand Christmas better. The characters and voice actors in this movie were above the bar. Each character was unique and original, and the voice actors thoroughly matched the characters. The dialogue in the movie is enlightening and educational for mature audiences who can understand the emotions and frustrations of Jack and the others. The scenes and backgrounds were unique in Tim Burton's style and helped make the movie unforgettable. The soundtrack and songs in the movie are Halloween classics that the audience is still listening to twenty-five years later. Overall, this is a great movie that gets the audience thinking about what the true meaning of Halloween is.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Ghoulish, dark christmas story.","From Henry Selick (JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH) and the master of horror Tim Burton (SLEEPY HOLLOW) comes the greatest Halloween and Christmas classic of all time. Talk about a creative mixture, this movie is one of the most ingenious films ever made. It takes place in the dark, horrific city of Halloween Town, where everything is scary, ghoulish and gloomy (just the way I like it). The movie is overrun with vampires, werewolves, skeletons, and undead children roaming the streets. And it leaves me with one thing: this movie is one of the coolest things I have ever seen!While the movie is not really a kids movie, it is kid friendly. The dialogue is friendly (no swear words) and the story is also friendly for the younger ones. What is not friendly is the ghoulish and gothic images (which are absolutely awesome!) and the horrific cast of Halloween characters that do things with items such as devices of torture, severed heads and other things like that. I know it sounds stupid, but this really is something your kids should not be seeing. I really don't care, let them see it, it is one of the coolest things I have ever seen. Just be advised that some of the scary elements might be a little much for their simple minds to handle.

Tim Burton's The nightmare before christmas (1993),"Now the ""Tim Burton's"" is a very significant word in the title because it reflects on the style and substance of his film making but actually most of the work was done by the Director Henry Sellick.This is based on the characters of Tim whom I personally love because when you watch a film it reminds you of a different and a unique world of Tim Burton and his world is relaxing and captivating.Likewise this is the same. Though the credits are different the film is amazingly structured and we get the seasonal vibes.Beautifully structured cinematic universe within the world of Jack Skellington and his crew and also the interconnectivity with other seasons and earth makes this a beautiful film.Overall - 3.5/5",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Christmas Town? Hmmm . . .,"No one saw THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas securing a solid pop culture standing, but it certainly has. And that makes me happy. There's some unexpected heart to this movie - at the very least on a technical level (you can see it was a labor of live with the staggering attention to detail and amazingly fluid animation, particularly in Jack's spindly limbs). And I love that, at its core, it's about a misguided scare king trying to extrapolate the meaning of Christmas from its various parts (complete with a scene in the lab). To top that off, it all goes horribly wrong. How often do you see Santa totally pi**ed? This is a winner for its songs alone, but it's also a high watermark in stop-motion animation.

From the imagination of Tim Burton,"I have seen (too) few of Tim Burton's films; Mars Attacks, Sleepy Hollow and the two first Batman films... all of them display dazzling visuals, Gothic style and an eery mood. I try to search out as many of his works as I can find, but they are hard to come by in my area. Therefore I was happy to find that a friend of mine had this to loan me. Burton created an amazing, enthralling and engaging world here. Never having been terribly into Christmas and never having celebrated Halloween(not being American), this movie had less impact on me than it would most viewers, I guess. The character of Jack Skellington (and his conflict) was an interesting one. I've never been terribly into musicals, but this one really had me intrigued and watching closely. The score by Danny Elfman is excellent. The plot moves along nicely, never losing your interest. The dark, Gothic tone of the film is incredibly absorbing. Though Tim didn't himself direct this(due to his commitment to the second Batman movie), but you can tell his involvement in the creative process. His influence is unmistakably visible in each shot. The colorful(or colorless, depending on how you look at it) characters are plentiful, diverse and fascinating. The DVD features a good commentary by Henry Selick, the director, and Pete Kozachik, the director of photography, and it has a lot of interesting information on the animation process. Lighting and production values are exceptional. So rich color palettes were used to create all of these vastly different worlds within the film. I remember watching most, if not all, of this a few years ago, at Christmas, as it was aired here... though upon watching it this time, I realized that I could remember very little of it. I doubt I 'got it' back then, and to be honest, I'm afraid I may not have, this time, either. Still an enjoyable fable, playing with the two holiday celebrations, and a creative thrill-ride from start to finish. I recommend this to all fans of Tim Burton, Gothic style and animation. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Dark, Gothic, Fun, and soooooo enjoyable for young and old!","It's Halloween and Jack, the King of this dark holiday, finds himself performing a fantastic Halloween Ceremony, but unbenknownst to his followers, save for a girl with a crush on him, Sally, Jack no longer wants to be apart of the Gloominess of Halloween, he wants something different.By chance he comes to a wooded area with doors leading to the lands of other holidays - Easter, Thanksgiving etc, and then one catches his interest. A door with a shining sparkling tree. Unable to resist his curiosity, Jack enters the door and into a world so unlike the one he knows - happy, gleeful, everyone enjoys themselves, it's so full of color, laughter and life - run by a big red man called ""Sandy Claws"" (or Santa Claus as we know him!) Jack on returning home, decides that instead of having his subjects prepare for Halloween - they'll prepare for Christmas as Jack has decided to take the joy of Christmas and give it to Halloween - this year HE will be the one to make millions of Children happy. Sally however has a feeling that this isn't going to go as smoothly as Jack would like. Jack meanwhile has Santa Kindapped, and orders that he be taken to place where he will be comfortable, and to be kept away from ""Oogie Boogie"" the Boogie Man for Santa's own safety.Also - unfortunately for Jack and the people of Halloween - they don't understand that what makes them (Zombies, Vampires, and Ghouls of Halloween)happy, and what makes human children happy are entirely different things, and wind up creating some... rather sick and dangerous toys. And when Oogie gets his hands on Santa and Sally, Jack realizes that the consequences of his actions have gotten desperately out of hand.The animation of the movie (Stop Frame Animation - I'm learning how to do that this autumn!! ^__^) is SUPERB, the character models are amazing and it runs so beautifully and suits the story it's telling so well.The music is very suitable too, and we have such a variety of great singers and songs - particular favourites of mine are ""Jack's Lament"" at the beginning and the ""Oogie Song"" - the Oogie song just reminds of the great Black singers of the passed which just bowled people over with their talent! The characters are very lovable, and Jack especially is very likable. Despite having Santa kidnapped his intentions ARE good ones (all he wants is to be happy and to make others happy)he's naive of the world beyond Halloween which people just take for cute silliness, and he's got an awesome singing voice! It isn't a scary movie - some of the Halloween townsfolk models may give you the creeps, but they aren't scary. The humour is lighthearted and fun, the story is amazing to watch. It is at times a dark movie but people love that stuff - yeah you've probably seen Jack around on some Goth girls handbag or wristband as he has become something of a Goth icon, take it as a sign that Jack - and this movie rock and go watch it if you haven't!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

A feast for the eyes and ears ... even if it's not technically a Tim Burton film,"An ambitious stop motion film which sees Jack the Pumpkin King journey from his native Hallowe'en Town to the neighbouring Christmas Town. When he attempts to bring the joy of the festive season to his horror-happy friends, they love it ... only because they've got the wrong end of the stick.The 76-minute film sees Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King in charge of the annual celebrations in his native Hallowe'en Town, lose motivation to do the same thing year after year. Stumbling across the neighbouring Christmas Town one evening, he attempts to introduce his old friends to his finding of presents, decorating trees and Santa Claus ... only for them to taint his explanations with their Hallowe'en-saturated imaginations. In the end, he gives them what they want to hear to the detriment of the habitants of Christmas Town, Santa Claus and Jack himself.Originally intended as a 30-minute Christmas TV special or a short film adaptation of a three-page poem written by Tim Burton, executives felt it was ""too weird"" for Disney to make and so it was shelved. After Burton's successes with Beetlejuice and Batman, the studio agreed to make it into a feature-length stop motion with Henry Sellick directing given Burton's commitments to the new Batman Returns at the time. At one stage, the team knew the story but not in its entirety - all eleven songs in the film were written before a word of the screenplay was on the page.Once you say it's a Tim Burton film, people know what to expect - a loner main character, twisted architecture and bizarre character design. All of the above are in abundance in a film some might say this is the most Tim Burton film ever made, despite him not being in the director's chair; he's credited as a producer instead. It's hard not to think of The Nightmare Before Christmas as the most surreal of Burton's films given the almost boundless potential afforded to the production team of building a miniature world with all the gravity-defying structures and unfeasible character design instead of creating it all at a 1:1 scale.It's not going to be a film for everyone (I showed it to people at uni and most of them hated it) but it's built a cult following in the 24 years since it came out to give it the wider audience it never had upon its initial limited release. One gripe is that some of the lyrics in the slower songs are thrown in to get the point across rather than making it a song that flows. That said, it's still a film guaranteed to put a smile on your face from the first viewing for the story to the latest for the amazingly attentive details hidden in the corners of every frame.Best Quote: ""Just because I cannot see it, doesn't mean I can't believe it!""",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Unique,"It's irrefutable that this film is already cult and has been a great influence on many people. Tim Burton's imagery is now recognizable worldwide and it all begins here, with the film directed by Henry Selick. The most notable thing, consequently, is the production design. The characters, the sets, the decoration... absolutely everything has Burton's trademark, which, helped with the practical effects of stop motion, gives us a beautiful visual spectacle. It's without a doubt the most notable.Now, moving on to other technicalities, the script is somewhat bland, cumbersome and boring. The edition tends to be repetitive and slow, for an animated musical. Everything has a clear justification, obviously, but even so, they are, in my opinion, negative points.As a side point, between us... was it necessary for it to be a musical? Anyway...In short, the film can be entertaining for those who like Burton's dark and depressive style, for lovers of stop motion and for those looking for something different, because without a doubt, they will find it here.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Sweeet.,"I enjoy Tim Burton's movies very very much, except for his Planet of the Apes but thats another commentary. His imagination is wild. This film, done mostly in stop motion is a masterpiece.

Its a warm family film if you ask me, very sweet and very special. Its a classic which remains imprinted in you. Ooh yes i definitely recommend. Jack Skeleton rocks. This is Halloween vs Christmas.

"Entertaining, fun and lots of spirit...","This stop-motion-animated movie from 1993 that came from the crazed mind of Tim Burton is indeed a classic unto its own right. And it is one that should be watched just around the Christmas holidays.The story is pretty good, and it has an abundance of absurdity to it that just makes it so lovable and fun to watch. The story, shortly summarized, is about Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, whom has grown weary of the same routine year after year. He stumbled upon a doorway to Christmas Town, and comes to see things in a whole new light.Now, there is an abundance of singing and dancing, while it is still stop-motion-animation, here, so it might not be in just everyone's taste. But most of the songs quickly grow on you and some are downright catchy ear-hangers. Especially the theme song, now who can't claim to be able to sing along to that one?The characters in ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is an abundance of memorable characters, each with very unique and memorable features and traits. Which definitely helps putting character and flavor to the movie.The voice acting in the movie is good, and they have a good ensemble of talented performers to do the various roles and characters, such as Danny Elfman, Chris Sarandon, Glenn Shadix , Paul Reubens, Ken Page and Catherine O'Hara.The style of characters and sets/scenes is just fabulous. It is very much in the archetypical spirit that we know from Tim Burtons movies, with lots of dark, gritty colors, crooked things, outstanding and memorable things. It is hard to detail, but once you see it you know what I am talking about.Keep in mind that the theme and the majority of all scenes are dark and may contain elements that might be deemed scary or disturbing to very young viewers.

"A visual treat for the eyes, and an involving fantasy for the mind","The Nightmare Before Christmas is a classic animated by Tim Burton. This movie is filmed in one of the most grueling filming techniques possible, stop motion animation. The animation is the most stunning stop motion animation I've ever seen in a movie, and that alone is worth the price of admission. The visual genius of Tim Burton is a treat to look at. The story is a very creative look at holidays and another type of story of how they came to be. This movie takes Christmas and puts a Halloween twist onto it. In some ways this is like the opposite version of The Grinch, and has some similar elements to Rudolph.The voices of the characters is also very good. Composer Danny Elfman provides the singing voice for the main character Jack Skellington. The characters are very memorable, and they are also very unique.The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of my favorite films of all time. There isn't one time during the year that feels complete without this movie. Despite being focused mainly on Christmas and Halloween, this movie can be watched during any other time of the year.Unfortunately, the popular store 'Hot Topic' has been selling Nightmare Before Christmas clothes just to make boat loads of money. Half of the people wearing the clothes haven't even seen this magnificent film, they just want to look ""Goth"" or ""punk"". Hopefully, people still realize that Nightmare Before Christmas is a great film and not just an icon to Goths and punks.Some younger kids may get scared by the Halloween creatures, but everyone else will fall in love with this movie from the time of the opening shot to the time the end credits start to role. If you haven't seen this movie, you should see it now. This movie is actually meant more for adults, meaning that adults can relate to the story better than kids can. Go ahead and watch this movie if you haven't done so already.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Darkly comic animation from Tim Burton, a great film.","The plot is simple as Jack Skellington is feeling uninspired in his role organising the scares for Halloween. Then he discovers Christmastown and is enchanted by the magic so he decides to kidnap Santa and hijack Christmas. The beauty of the film is the seamless blending of the excellent stop-motion animation and the great Danny Elfman score. Also the neat little touches make the film watchable again and again. Although, as you would expect from Tim Burton, this film is quite dark it's great comic touches, like the accidental kidnapping of the easter bunny, give it a good sense of humour.I find it hard to see how anyone could dislike this film. Although some people I know have not given it a chance saying they dislike musicals, I don't really like musicals but I loved this film. So unless you detest anything with even a hint of musical I seriously recommend giving this a try.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Perfect for Halloween ... perfect for Christmas ... perfect for kids ... perfect for adults ... just ... perfect,"I have always liked the work of Tim Burton. I think is one of the most imaginative directors. He had great movies (except ""Planet of the apes"" and ""Sleppy Hollow"").""The nightmare before Christmas"" is the story of Jack, a skeleton who lives in Halloween town. But he is so tired of screams, ghosts and monsters. Suddenly, he discovers a new world for him. The Christmas town. Now he want live the Christmas too ... but the problems begin here. With the incredible music of Danny Elfman, the story of Tim Burton is one of the most imaginative tales of all times.With the wonderful ones Catherine O'Hara and Chris Sarandon, this lovely movie had certain characteristics imposed by various influences. For example, Vincent Price. The short ""Vincent"" is an ode to his Tim Burton's inspiration. ""Vincent"" uses the same techniques of ""The nightmare before Christmas"". I believe in that time nobody saw it come.The characters like Jack, Sally, the mad scientist, the faces of the mayor, the evil children's, the witches, Santa and the villain Oogie Boogie are unforgettable. The songs are sticky and beautiful too.So, before you will request candies, before you open your presents watch this movie first. This is a good movie. A movie for all.*Sorry for the mistakes ... well if there any",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A Ghoulish Tale with Wicked Humour & Stunning Animation.,"A pioneering work of animation at its time, The Nightmare Before Christmas is a stop-motion animation musical concerning the Pumpkin King of the Halloweenland named Jack Skellington who is bored from planning the annual Halloween celebrations every year. While on his way back home, he discovers a portal to Christmasland & is instantly infatuated with the lively Christmas spirit. Unable to understand its concept, he decides to celebrate the holiday & gets the residents of his town to help him prepare for it which, as expected, goes wrong.Due to its dark, brooding & creepy yet hilarious atmosphere, many mistake this film to be Tim Burton's work, which is further complicated by his name on the title which was strictly for marketing purposes. But it's actually Henry Selick who helms the director's chair with writing & production credits going to Burton. The film makes brilliant use of stop-motion animation blended with puppetry to come out as something fresh, original & intensely creative plus the steadily narrated story only helps the film work charmingly well.The script is very lively, the concept is new as well, cinematography is distinctive, editing manages to trim the film enough to tell its tale under 80 minutes, the voice actors are nicely cast & music as well as songs by Danny Elfman is a strong supportive character in itself that makes the story work with Elfman also voicing many characters. On an overall scale, The Nightmare Before Christmas would've been an unforgettable experience had I watched it at a younger age but as of now, although it didn't disappoint, I still felt no real affection towards it.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

It has a very simple plot but it's visually stunning,"This long animation from Tim Burton is already considered a cult classic and surely a reference from this director. It's visually stunning and it creates characters and ""worlds"" that can only truly exist in Tim Burton's mindÂ… and it is, in my perspective, its most valuable feature. The plot is very simple and straight to follow but in fact it's what matters the less! The scenarios, the colors, the strange characters, the black humor and its final message are what really matter in this long animation!

Let me add my praise for a brilliant production,"I read several of the comments here and some were so good (such as the one from Bob the Moo) I hesitated to add my ""2 cents worth."" I'm not sure what words have not already been used - brilliant, charming, amusing, wonderfully inventive, enjoyable. Creative masterpiece isn't going too far, I don't think.Let me add that I'm a mature adult (very mature!) and like some others I wasn't sure I'd like this based on the concept and cover art. But I was totally captivated by it from the opening number.What seems to me to be the most remarkable aspect is how this appeals to an inner core inside all of us. It operates on a subtle and almost sublime level for me - it captivates my imagination and carries it along. There are many details to enjoy on subsequent viewings, all of which simply add to the surreal enchantment.The music and lyrics are simply remarkable. Don't be surprised to find yourself humming a few bars from them the next day. One other thing I enjoyed is that unlike many popular songs the lyrics are never blanketed by overwrought orchestrations. You can quite literally hear and understand every word of the songs - and such clever lyrics they are. They add so much to the story and the understanding of the characters, more so than almost any other film.It's hard to find enough positive words for this - I gave it 10, the only 10 I've given out. You will love it ~!(And a special thank you to Rusty Cat for introducing me to this film.)",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Best film ever?,"Asking someone what is the best film ever made, is a very unfair question, since that there are so many brilliant films out there in the world (unfortunately, the crap films still reign supreme!!!), but if somebody asked me that question I would have to pick this film.Why? Because this is the only film I've seen that seemed to do everything right. Even films like 'A Clockwork Orange', 'Fight Club' or 'American Beauty' had their (small) flaws. What can I say? I've never liked musicals, and I doubt I ever will (although 'South Park' was very funny), but this movie seems to owe most of it's greatness to it's songs.Well, that and the story, the characters, the stop-motion animation, etc. Like I said earlier; Everything about this movie is brilliant!

The Best Halloween Movie,"This is the one film I need to see every Halloween to make the day feel complete. The Nightmare Before Christmas is filled with wonder and terror and laughs and reflection. It is the perfect movie to end Halloween on and start the countdown toward Christmas.This was my second time watching this film if my memory serves me correct. And I have to say, I did enjoy it more than I remember doing the last time. The Nightmare Before Christmas is so unbelievably imaginative that it just baffles the mind. Every creature in Halloween Town is unique and scary in its own way. Every song is rather wonderful and filled with meaning.This movie also manages to be exciting from start to finish. There isn't a dull moment to be found. Even the slower singing scenes are fun because of the fantastic lyrics that each song has. And outside of those, the movie is constantly going forwards. Every scene and sequence feels like it's just the perfect length, and the 76 minutes that this wonderful film lasts, fly by.As I'm sure you can tell, I absolutely love this movie. I can't imagine going a Halloween without watching it. It is the perfect ending for the day and it puts me in a great mood.

One enjoyable Halloween film!,"Capturing the eye and and the attention of the watcher, this film has a magical, somewhat scary quality. It has beautiful puppet animation with skeletons, ghouls and even pleasant things such as Father Christmas. The songs are very imaginative - bouncy yet flowing and not necessarily rhyming. The characters are also very engaging and lively - especially Jack Skellington himself and Oogie Boogie. The plot keeps twisting and turning in a good way as a plot should - and many things don't happen that happen in many children's films, past and present.One flaw of this film is that it is a little scary and this may put off young children. This film also feels surprisingly short - despite being a full-length feature film. Otherwise, a perfect Halloween and Christmas film! :-)The main character is Jack Skellington, a skeleton, who is extremely good at scaring people at Halloween. He lives in Halloween Town, with vampires, werewolves and other scary creatures and people. Jack wishes for some other life where he does not have to hear screams and scare people and that is when he discovers the wonderous Christmas Town...A good treat for every person who likes animated films -especially those who are aged 7 and up.

"Tim Burton: 9 , Danny Elfman: 0","Tim Burton created a visually fascinating environment and characters for The Nightmare Before Christmas, and gave them a clever rough plot, then Danny Elfman came along and basically ruined any potential the film had with some of the worst song lyrics I have ever heard. Since The Nightmare Before Christmas (TNBC) is a musical, this means that the majority of dialog sounds like it was written by a bored 13 year-old for a junior high school musical.For example, from a song with the lame title of ""What's This?"": ""What's this? What's this? There's color everywhere!--What's this? There's white things in the air!--What's this? I can't believe my eyes, I must be dreaming!--Wake up, Jack, this isn't fair!--What's this? What's this? There's something very wrong!--What's this? There's people singing songs!--I want it, oh, I want it, Oh, I want it for my own!--I've got to know I've got to know,--What is this place that I have found?--What is this? Christmas Town, hmm...""Or how about""Kidnap Mr. Sandy Claws--I wanna do it! Let's draw straws.--Jack said we should work together--Three of a kind, Birds of a feather--Now and forever, Wheeee--La, la, la, la, la""Or:""This time, this time--Making Christmas, Making Christmas--Making Christmas, making Christmas is so fine--It's ours this time And won't the children be surprised--It's ours this time--Making Christmas, Making Christmas--Making Christmas Time to give them something fun--They'll talk about for years to come--Let's have a cheer from everyone--It's time to party""Elfman has impressive credentials and has done memorable theme songs and soundtrack work before. And, while I enjoyed his band Oingo-Boingo back in the '80s, their songs were conceptually clever but lyrically simple. And while Oingo-Boingo's songs like ""Only a Lad"", ""Little Girls"" and the like had catchy hooks, the tunes he wrote for TNBC are instantly forgettable. With a better songwriter and lyricist, TNBC could've become a classic, up there with ""The Grinch who Stole Christmas"" or ""A Charley Brown Christmas"". Instead, it has to settle for being a visual cult film, with memorable-looking characters and sets, but nothing memorable to say.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Certified 100% Pure Burton,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is the most ""Tim Burton""-y film ever made, which is slightly unfair, as it was directed by veteran animator Henry Selick. Yet it represents nothing less than the fullest, most successful expression of his style and themes, not to mention one of the finest animated feature films ever made.The citizens of Halloween Town are in a bit of a funk: they need something new. Our hero, Jack, the Pumpkin King, stumbles across a portal to Christmas Town and returns entrances, having misinterpreted everything about that other holiday, and decides to import it back home. A hilarious degree of failure ensues.Beyond it's original story and wonderful characters, It's hard to understate how important this film is: Tim Burton's style has always been distinctive but never before or since has the world of animation allowed an artist to explore his style to its limits on such a budget and scale. The animation and visuals are top-notch, a jewel in Selick's already distinguished career. The design is what really makes this endure, and the inventiveness on display sets a new standard. Also pulling more than his usual weight is Danny Elfman, who composes and performs songs more memorable than anything in Disney's recent catalog, as well as his finest score.Even if you manage to overlook the virtuoso craftsmanship on display, you are left with a great tale, and characters you will fight hard not to fall in love with, particularly as they insist on not learning from any of their mistakes.Just do yourself a favor, and see it now!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

I sold my video taped version and hope to see it on DVD.Most impressive were the Burton's archetypal images joined with Danny Elfman's musical composition and the ultimate opera they achieved. A Jungian representation of ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""Bach's Mass in B-Minor"".In many ways we are sew to gether and patched up, in one way shape or form, and each of us in our own way hope to discover the land of Christmas and its true meaning.Each of us participates in our own way to proceed from the mundane thru the arcane.Mr. Burton and Mr. Elfman have in their own unigue way created amethod to proceed from the ordinary to the extraordinary. They took a simple theme and gender, and there their individual and combined insight transformed it to reflect each persons dream to become something, or someone greater then they're parts, then they're past, then they're whole.The tension points in the film are exquisitely brought forth by Elfman's voice and composition. The entire is carried by the visual images of Burton and audio expressions of Elfman.The entire deserved an Oscar, for each. And I look forward to perhaps a return of both of them to again to an animated opera.Just in the future, please release it in full-screen DVD.David",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

The Pumpkin King that stole Christmas...,"Since Tim Burton is the very definition of the word ""weird"", it's no surprise to me that THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas (which I resisted seeing up until now), is richly imaginative and entertaining in the way it puts a special twist on the holiday spirit of Halloween and Christmas.Instead of the Grinch Who Stole Christmas, we have The Pumpkin King (Jack) bringing horror to the Yuletide holidays and kiddies everywhere by riding Santa's sleigh and depositing horrific toys to frighten kids in a manner usually reserved for Halloween. Of course, in the end, the real Santa is allowed to reappear (after being held hostage) and allowed to bring his special brand of cheer to a world momentarily deprived of Santa and his toys.It's all richly dark and scary (for kids), imaginative, and visually stunning with so much to watch at any given moment that it becomes almost a strain on the eyes to follow all the cleverness accurately without a pause for breath. In other words, it's what I would call a very ""busy"" film, but certainly an enjoyable one if you're in the mood for quality animation of this kind (stop-motion models).All I can say is the Disney studios never released anything remotely like this sort of dark fantasy when I was a kid, when everything was geared more to the lighter side with darkness only rearing up in the form of witches or dragons--and the songs were simple, catchy tunes that people could sing afterwards. That, for me, is the big drawback here. Danny Elfman's songs are devoid of any special sort of charm and certainly can't be called memorable. They work within the context of this story, but not apart from it.Nevertheless, this is undoubtedly a richly imaginative piece of animated art and well worth viewing whether young or old.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Yes t was weird & scary images throughout but that was the plan. The original songs composed for this film are also very clever. Those songs to this day are still under appreciated. Listen to the lyrics. That not only help move story along but they are also the funniest things in this film.I think people are so unaware that in 1993 that Disney kind of disowned this film. The marketing push by the studio was very small! In fact Disney did not put there name on the film. They released under their ""TOUCHSTONE PICTURES"" label!

Christmas Tim Burton and Addam's Family style,"TNMBC entertains the thought that each major American holiday is coordinated and carried out by different towns: Christmas Town, Easter Town, Halloween Town, etc. Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon and Danny Elfman), a tall, slim, well-dressed skeleton, is The Man in Halloween Town but he's bored with his role. When he comes across Christmas Town he has the idea that maybe he could create the same type of atmosphere in Halloween Town and deliver Christmas just like Christmas Town does.We're treated to many ballads as the Halloween version of a Christmas plot unfolds. We're reminded of the follies that accompany good intentions and naivete. And we're reminded of being appreciative. This dark musical comedy has Tim Burton's stamp all over it.

"A Halloween Film, Not a Christmas film","I loved this film.  My first experience with this in the theaters was not so great.  First of all, although it features both Halloween and Christmas in the film, it is to me a Halloween movie.  This is such a more thrilling movie at that time.  Nevertheless, when this released where I lived, it was just before Christmas, and that didn't go to well.  Plus, it was a late-night showing on a weekend in a theater packed with loud drinkers.  So I didn't get too much out of it.  But as soon as I saw it in my own home, around Halloween, it became apparent what a great film this is.  The story is highly creative, and the characters are awesome.

One of the best animated musicals of all time,"The first inspiration for this movie came when Tim Burton was walking past a shop window and saw the Halloween decorations being taken down and replaced by Christmas decorations. The peculiar image of Santa and his reindeer matched with the ghouls and goblins and Halloween sparked off an idea for a creepy poem, which eventually become an ambitious feature length project made entirely with stop-motion ...Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King, is the most popular figure in Halloweentown -- a town populated by figures such as Mr Hyde, the Wolf Man, a mad scientist and assorted ghosts, goblins and mutants. Every year they come together for the soul purpose of scaring everyone, and then wait 365 days until next Halloween. But this year is going to be a little different ... while wandering through the woods, Jack finds a portal to a place called Christmastown, and watches as Santa and his elves make presents and prepare for this years festivities. Fascinated by this, Jack comes up with a plan to 'hijack' Christmas, kidnapping Santa and having the citizens of Halloweentown make lots of unusual presents for him to deliver on his skeleton sleigh ...While this movie is adapted from an illustrated poem by Tim Burton and superbly directed by Henry Selick (James and Giant Peach), the real star of the show is Danny Elfman, who scores most of Burton's movies. He wrote the score and the lyrics for ""Nightmare Before Christmas"", and also performed as the singing voice of the 'hero', Jack Skellington. The quality of the songs and the music is above and beyond what anybody could have expected from this movie and, strange as it sounds, this is actually my favourite musical of the last twenty years or so at least. Songs such as ""This is Halloween"", ""Jack's Lament"" and various others are masterpieces of high-class Gothic music, and the tunes will stay with you for a long time afterwards.The voice-over cast are all top-class, with performers such as Chris Sarandon (The Princess Bride), Catherine O'Hara (Lemony Snicket) and Glenn Shadix (Heathers). And the look of the film is just fantastic ... it's a real visual treat, and that alone is reason enough to watch it even it it wasn't for the great music and captivating story. Tim Burton was so enthralled by the creepy stop-motion animation here that he used it again in ""Mars Attacks"", and in his 2005 movie ""The Corpse Bride"", which looks very similar to this one.It's dark and it's wonderful and it's more than slightly disturbing ... next Halloween, you have to watch this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"There has never been anything like it, and nothing ever will be again","A weird and wonderful animated adventure unlike any other- The Nightmare Before Christmas shines in artistic brilliance, originality, and just plain fun. I honestly couldn't try to describe this film to you if I tried, much less the plot of it. Needless to say, it being the brainchild of Tim Burton, the film is full of macabre humor and visuals, and a very versatile style. The animation is fantastic and still holds up as some of the best stop motion films of all time. The songs are catchy and the world is so exuberant and thought-provoking- you are bound to get lost within its craziness. I also love the little details of the film, the setting, the visual gags, and how much thought is given in to each character. An unpopular opinion maybe, but I absolutely adore the character of Oogie-Boogie, and find his voice and look very pleasing. The film does have some slower moments, and some repetitive ones.

One of Tim Burton's Best Work,"The movies can create entirely new worlds for us, but that is one of their rarest gifts. More often, directors go for realism, for worlds we can recognize. One of the many pleasures of ""Tim Burton's the Nightmare Before Christmas"" is that there is not a single recognizable landscape within it. Everything looks strange and haunting. Even Santa Claus would be difficult to recognize without his red-and-white uniform. Tim Burton is my favorite director of all time one reason is because of The nightmare before Christmas. The movie, which tells the story of an attempt by Halloween to annex Christmas, is shot in a process called stop-action animation. In an ordinary animated film, the characters are drawn. Here they are constructed, and then moved a little, frame by frame, so that they appear to live. This allows a three-dimensional world to be presented, instead of the flatter universe of cel animation. And it is a godsend for the animators of ""Nightmare,"" who seem to have built their world from scratch - every house, every stick and stone - before sending their skeletal and rather pathetic little characters in to inhabit it. The movie begins with the information that each holiday has its own town. Halloweentown, for example, is in charge of all the preparations for Halloween, and its most prominent citizen is a bony skeleton named Jack Skellington, whose moves and wardrobe seem influenced by Fred Astaire. ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a Tim Burton film in the sense that the story, its world and its look first took shape in Burton's mind, and he supervised their filming. But the director of the film, a veteran stop-action master named Henry Selick, is the person who has made it all work. And his achievement is enormous. The songs by Danny Elfman are fun, too, a couple of them using lyrics so clever they could be updated from Gilbert & Sullivan. And the choreography, liberated from gravity and reality, has an energy of its own, as when the furniture, the architecture and the very landscape itself gets into the act.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A Delightfully Weird Movie,"This film is both visually stunning and entertaining.  Combining many different types of animation, one must respect the amounts of work that went into this film.  Danny Elfman outdoes himself with the film's score, and is sensational as the voice of Jack.  The resulting amalgam between the weirdness of Burton and the magic of Disney is clever, fun, and great for the entire family.  It is terrific to watch it before Halloween, or during Christmas time.  This film lifts me up whenever I watch it.  It is one of my favorite animated movies and a great musical as well.  Don't miss this one.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Awesome,"I cant get enough of this movie, I've been watching it since i was three.Even though it took me till i was older to grasp the meaning it manages to captivate me every time. It relates to people in real life. We live in daily routine and sometimes we just get sick of it, and the same concept applied to Jack in this movie.Think about it, for Jack to go from a gloomy death ridden place to a magical world full of fun,light, and laughter had to be something exciting and utterly different for him. Well after his adventure in Christmas land he goes home to Halloween town in hope of spreading all that he had witnessed in Christmas land such as opening presents and toys but no one seems to comprehend the beauty in all of it.While Jack is wrapped up in the meaning of Chrotoem's and taking over it he is completely oblivious of Sallys warnings and love. In the end Jacks plans become a disaster.After everything falls out of place, is when Jack realizes that what hes been doing in Halloween town is whats right for him, and that what he did was wrong. The songs in this movie match perfectly with every character so well that you tend to feel for them as if they are real you get a better understanding of their personality.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
it had much more potential,"the nightmare before Christmas was once again one of Tim Burton' weird and wonderful creations although it did seem to have much more potential than what was made of it. i say this only because the biggest twist in the film i just went 'oh OK' where as the usual stuff that Tim Burton writes i'am surprised as to how it happened. This film was rather disappointing because i would have expected more from Tim Burton but it is still a really good film just not up to his usual standards. it kind of felt like what pixar would do if they ever went into claymation, mild, rather simple story line and (sorry to say but) overrated. i know many people will disagree with me but i just felt more could have been done to make it one of his great films with that unique touch of genius to the characters but since its already been made i'll settle with it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
This is Halloween!,"I have just seen Digital 3-D version of this Master-Piece from Tim Burton's imagination. It's the same but now, you have the opportunity to see it again with the technology on 3-D and on the big screen.Fabulous tale about Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king, a lord of the Halloween celebration, who, annoyed of that celebration, he is looking for something new. Then. he find the Xmas celebration, this causes a great impression to him. Thus this is arming a magical film, with dark characters as much as charmers. With gorgeous scenes on stop-motion animation, Burton as a creator, Sellick as the director, bring us a story about love, fantasy, dreams, and good intentions, despite of our characters come from Halloween Town.Burton teaches to us how to create stories on a dismal atmosphere, but with a kind essence, all his filmography show it (Edward Scissorhands, The Corpse Bride, BettleJuice, The Big Fish, etc.). Selick, by his part, dominates the art of Stop-motion animation, like he did it in ""James and the Giant Peach"".Maybe it was very dark for Disney, but, with the step of the years, Nightmare Before Christmas has turned into a cult-movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"A ""stop motion"" milestone","This animated film for adults and adolescents focuses on Jack Skellington, the most notable citizen of Halloween Town, and the unexpected trip he made to the Christmas City, where he discovers the Christmas spirit without, however, understanding it. Directed and written by Tim Burton, the film features the voices of Danny Elfman, Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara, William Hickey and Glenn Shadix.This is one of the most famous animated films in stop motion and was even nominated for the Oscar for Best Visual Effects due to the quality of animation achieved. Tim Burton has talent, especially for films considered strange or out of standards. Horror or mystery themes are rather visited by the director in the form of animations (""Corpse Bride"" is the most striking example). In this case, it addresses the celebration of Halloween, a popular holiday in the English-speaking countries, which has begun to be observed also in Latin Europe, timidly, for cultural import of the ""mass media"" (in these countries people celebrate the All Saints Day).The script is very good, funny and directly clashes the two holidays. The characters are imaginative and made with great care. The voices were quite well most of the time. Its noticed how Burton were engaged in the project. Very meticulous, he argued for the greatest perfection possible in the film. The sets and visual effects were at the highest level, playing with the most popular objects of Halloween and Christmas. Photography can displease because of low contrast, but I believe it was the best that could be achieved in 1993, and the film, if it were made today, with digital technologies in filming and editing, would have been a rather different picture. The soundtrack, in charge of Danny Elfman, is excellent. He also composed all the songs that are sung in the film. Some of them stays in the ear, others are quite moving, as the songs interpreted by the ""rag doll"" Sally.For all these reasons, this movie is a reference in contemporary animation, and is suitable, in particular, for lovers of the scariest day of the year.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"""With all our tricks we're making Christmas time""","Stop-motion animation has been around almost since the beginning of cinema, but this was the first time the form had been used for a full-length motion picture. Just like cell animation sixty years earlier, the claymation we see here had been employed for pre-feature shorts or blended with live-action, but hadn't really been taken seriously as a facet of the cinematic medium. This is one of the good things about having popular mavericks like Tim Burton in Hollywood â€“ they can use their mainstream bankability to push through projects the studios wouldn't normally touch with a bargepole.Burton didn't actually direct Nightmare Before Christmas. He instead produced and came up with the story outline, but this doesn't make much difference as far as the finished production is concerned. This is perhaps the most archetypal Burton story, the ultimate tale of scary looking outsiders trying to fit in with the bright and happy world outside and failing beautifully. There's also that familiar look of both characters and scenery (Burton was always heavily involved with the design of his movies) â€“ spindly figures, wild hair, black and white stripes, curling fronds like gnarled fingers. There's been a depressing trend in recent decades of making horror characters seem comical rather than scary, and The Nightmare Before Christmas, with its mix of the grotesque and the cartoonish, is a (probably unwitting) flagship for this. It's a shame because it's essentially the dumbing-down of kid's stuff. Children's movies were better when they could be properly frightening.Something that really helps The Nightmare Before Christmas work is its being a musical. At first hearing Composer Danny Elfman's skittering melodies don't seem suited to singing, but then you realise just how much story and characterisation is carried in those lyrics. It's all a bit reminiscent of Lerner and Loewe's musicals, in that the songs are very much used to move the story along. And the tunes â€“ while not exactly ones that are easy to sing along to â€“ are rather pretty. They're also highly evocative â€“ ""What's This?"" fizzes like a snowstorm, ""Sally's Song"" feels tender and sad, ""Jack's Lament"" is by turns proud and melancholy. Oogie Boogie's bluesy number injects a little bit of fun to kick off the final act of the movie.And we shouldn't downplay the contribution of actual director Henry Selick. Selick takes this stop motion feature with a cinematic approach, using close-ups, camera moves, tilts and the like, to dramatic. The level of detail to the sets is exceptional, and there is a no-expense-spared look one would not associate with the shorts this medium has typically been used in. Most importantly however is the personality that goes into movement the characters. At ten frames a second, this isn't exactly smooth, but there is a wonderful texture and life in stop-motion that you don't quite get in other forms of animation. This is probably the biggest gift that The Nightmare Before Christmas has given us â€“ the championing and reinvigoration of this seemingly dated art form, ironically in the very decade that CGI became the predominant animation method. It paved the way for many more claymation movies, which is undoubtedly a good thing.And as a final thought, I'll just mention that stop motion is an incredibly easy form of animation to do at home. All you need nowadays is a digital camera and the right software (you can do it with Photoshop), plus of course a bit of patience and imagination. It doesn't have to be clay models â€“ you can animate object you like. Have fun..!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
xmas cracker,"Born from the depths of Tim Burton amazing imagination, The Nightmare before Christmas puts a twist into the old holiday tale.Made in 1993, this film still stands out and wouldn't look dated if released today.Made using state of the art stop motion animation and with Danny Elfmans brilliant score and sing along songs, this is a film for all ages.Jack Skelington is the pumpkin king who lives in a place called halloween town. A dark place full of weird and wonderful characters who spend the entire year planning the next halloween party, with Jack looking over the proceedings. Then after one quite frightful halloween, Jack realises that something is missing in his life, and whilst walking through the woods he comes across a door that leads him to the world of Christmas town, a place bright and happy. Jack finds the place awe inspiring and when he returns to his home of Halloween, decides to bring festive cheer with him. The characters are brilliant, as is the music and gags.

"Appealing to a certain crowd, but enjoyable and fun nonetheless","The Nightmare Before Christmas is a great story about a skeleton named Jack who wants to make Christmas. Why? Well, Jack accidentally stumbles upon this place, and is magically transported to Christmas Town. Jack is the king of Halloween, but Christmas is something new. Jack falls in love with the new place and decides to make Christmas. So, the misunderstood skeleton and his ghost dog persuade the town to prepare for Christmas. However, their plan doesn't go as it should of been, but I won't spoil anymore of this movie.Tim Burton usually makes strange movies, and this is no exception. However, it isn't so strange that you can't understand it. Tim Burton's classic story of Jack Skelington (that's his full name) is probably one of the best Disney movie and great for Christmas. (You can watch it on Halloween too, but then you'll get all excited for Christmas. It happens to me.) It has some drama, great music, interesting looks, and a good story too. The only main downside, is the unique story, takes no twists or turns, and the main appeal in the music.Oh well. The Nightmare before Christmas is still a great cult.RECOMMENDED 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
WOW!,"""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" for me, is one of those films that is beyond any criticism whatsoever.  To me, it is art in the truest sense of the word.  It is the best modern musical I've seen, the best animated film I've ever seen, and one of the best films I've ever seen.  Tim Burton, the postmodern German expressionist, has carved a devilishly beautiful film out of his twisted little head.  He didn't direct or write the script, unlike everyone thinks, so just as much credit is due to those who did.  Every frame in this film is a painting.  It's a shame that this film isn't on the Top 250 list (let alone the top 10)--if any film deserves to be, this is it. The art (perhaps a modern manifesto of German expressionism), the direction, Danny Elfman's musical numbers (notice the throwback to ""Singin' in the Rain"" when Jack jumps on the bench in the snowy graveyard) are all sooo well done.  It is as close to a perfect entertainment as any film can come and can be watched over and over and over again.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.  If you haven't seen it, it is a must.9.5/10 (my highest rating, I don't believe in 'tens.'  Don't ask.)",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Review #10,"I love Tim Burton films. And I also enjoy this movie a lot. First I'll talk about some of the flaws. Most of the songs move a little to slow and I got bored after a while. The story is very simple. But that isn't really that bad, taking it's supposed to be a family film. I say this might be a little to scary for the younger kids. I would save this for 8 and up. But that is the great thing about this. It has enough scares & humor to keep the older viewers happy. While enough of the normal cartoon stuff, to keep the kids happy. And this is the only film to my knowledge that can be watched for Halloween & Christ-mas. But the best thing about this movie is the gothic feel. I love that about Tim Burton movies. Even ""Ed Wood"" felt a little gothic with the black & white. This movie gets a 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
An implausible masterpiece,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is a legitimate classic. It is striking because it's perfectly weird, unapologetically sympathetic to everything creepy. Its greatest aspect is definitely the production design, which is incredibly unique and strangely beautiful. Many characters and locations are iconic specifically because they capture that narrow balance of unsettling and endearing. Meanwhile, the film's technicals work wonderfully to heighten those designs. The imagery utilizes skewed angles, shadows, and colorful lighting to ignite an eerie style. The sound is playfully spooky, the animation is trend-setting, and the music is unforgettable. Collectively, this creates a bewitching atmosphere that is rarely achieved.Still, it is the unlikely emotions of The Nightmare Before Christmas which drive the experience. Because the story is so unusual, yet so heartfelt, the film resonates with viewers on a deep level. Beneath all the stunning artistry, there is a core message of self-acceptance. Even if others find you bizarre, you have a place in this world. And since that is understood on every level (delicately woven into the eccentric script, intentionally elevated by the technicals, and brilliantly united by the direction), The Nightmare Before Christmas is an implausible masterpiece. Truly, this is a film for all audiences.Writing: 9/10

Christmas Evel,"Tim Burton wrote and co-produced this short, musical, stop-animation feature, (it was directed by Henry Slick, but has Burton's fingerprins all over it)) as an antidote to other cuddly seasonal features which are available, cleverly conflating probably his own favourite holiday season Halloween with everybody else's, Christmas.The story's quite simple and straightforward, Halloween Jack (wasn't that a line in a Bowie song?) Skellington (love that spelling!) organises Halloween for his fellow town residents but has lately become bored in the process. To rejuvenate himself, he decides to borrow a few tricks from neighbouring Christmas Town where he thinks a little mix-and-match of the two holidays might succeed. It does seem a bit like painting a moustache on the Mona Lisa and his adoring girlfriend Sally Finkelstein, who is forever trying to escape the attentions of her creator, Dr Finkelstein, tries to tell him so, but headstrong Jack carries on regardless, his master stroke, or so he thinks, being to kidnap Sandy Claws (his spelling), take his place and dispense much less wholesome toys to all the nice boys and girls. Actually in this day and age, I'm not sure old Jack wasn't onto something considering some of the videogames kids play today.Anyway, at least in 1993, he gets it wrong, spoiling every youngster's Christmas morning and at the same time jeopardising Santa himself who he's left in the care of the bad old Boogie Man. Who knows though, maybe Sally can literally pull herself together and help Jack to save the day...For me, the most disappointing feature of the movie was the rather lukewarm soundtrack provided by Danny Elfman. None of the songs stay in the memory although I will concede they do help the story along. I liked two sequences in particular, Jack's disastrous delivery of the kiddies' gifts and the showdown with the Boogie Man. The animation is excellent throughout, recalling for me anyway ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Yellow Submarine"" and even ""H. R. Pufnstuf"". Perhaps I'd have liked a few more good jokes in the dialogue and a little bit darker treatment in the narrative, but on the whole, I'll take Burton's, let's call it a grey Christmas, over ""The Snowman"" any old Christmas Day.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Movie Schitzo's Review of ""Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas""","Henry Selick has directed some great funny animated movies such as Mokeybone, and James and the Giant Peach. So when he teamed up with Tim Burton, they made a great animated classic. Much like Tim Burton's Corpse Bride, Tim Burton's The Nightmare before Christmas has been a Halloween/ Christmas tradition for many years, thanks to an imaginative and funny script from Tim Burton who wrote it. The plot is as old as time: Jack Skellington (Chris Sarrandon) is the skeleton King of Halloweentown and is getting tired of the same old routine every single year. So one day while taking his ghost dog Zero, he stumbles upon the door leading out of his world and into Christmastown. Not knowing much about Christmas he decides to bring Christmas to Halloweentown and in the essence destroys the holiday for every one, all the while trying to save his girlfriend Sally the Rag Doll (Catherine O' Hara) and Santa Claus (Edward Ivory) from the clutches of the evil Ooogie Boogie Man (Ken Page). Over the years this has become an animated classic among kids and adults and has been celebrated throughout the years. The voice talent is great and strong for this movie and keeps the plot flowing. The animation and visual effects are great also. All in all, a very celebrated Halloween/ Christmas animated musical family film.3 out of 4 stars",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Halloween meets Christmas,"The main asset of The Nightmare Before Christmas is that it's visually stunning and it shows imaginative world-building, like pretty much any project that Tim Burton is involved in.Jack Skellington is a typical Tim Burton character who is in conflict with a world that seems to have no place for him (see Edward Scissorhands, Willy Wonka, Sweeney Todd, Alice, Batman, etc.). However, he is - what an irony - not as cartoonish as some of those and ends up being a relatable figure while the audience watches his attempt at replacing Halloween with Christmas.The one major problem with this movie is that the songs were rather dull and unfortunately it's hard to ignore it as there's a ton of them, it's essentially a musical. And that hurts the story as well, as it constantly loses momentum.Also, kids might have a hard time enjoying Burton's dark and creepy aesthetics.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Nice Christmas (or Halloween) Movie,"The Nightmare Before Christmas, a movie directed by Henry Selick, based on the beloved story by Tim Burton. The movie follows a bored Skelton named Jack, Jack discovers a new holiday named Christmas, he convinces all the people of Halloween town that Christmas is such a magical holiday (which it is) but a ragdoll named Sally has a feeling that Jack won't know how to handle this beloved holiday, she tries to warn him but he doesn't listen. But can Jack handle Christmas, delivering presents, or a villainous gambling ghost? And that's all I'm gonna say, cause I don't wanna spoil it as much as I have to. But let me just say, I totally get why people love this movie. I mean its a Disney classic! This movie is dark, funny, musical, and entertaining. So watch this movie if you want, cause its a masterpiece of a film! One thing I love about this movie is, you get to watch it at Christmas and Halloween.

Halloween Plus Christmas Equals......Fun!,"The Nightmare Before Christmas was produced during the heyday of Disney's Renaissance period and it is another example of a Disney classic. Now this isn't as strong as the Lion King or the Little Mermaid, but it's serviceable enough. This concept was created by Tim Burton and throughout the film, we can see his visionary touches. The visuals are very creepy and I also liked the music. The concept is a genius idea as we see what happens when Halloween and Christmas is combined.Henry Selick's film is about the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town named Jack who is not happy with the continuous tradition of Halloween. Jack stumbles into Christmas Town and falls in love with Christmas. Jack decides to get his buddies at Halloween Town to join in the festive spirit....but it may be a big mistake.The film doesn't feature a big voice cast at all, as the movie is mostly song. But composer Danny Elfman sung many of the songs and I thought he did a very good job. In any case, we do have talent from Chris Sarandon to Catherine O'Hara in this movie.Overall, The Nightmare Before Christmas is another strong movie for Disney. It's not perfect by any means, especially when it comes to the writing. The movie seemed to grow stale towards the end, so we must be thankful for the incredibly short running time. But in all, this was a very entertaining film thanks to the vision of Tim Burton.My Grade: B+",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

The stop-motion film that set the tone for animation in the 21st century,"With its pioneering use of stop-motion animation, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" will always have its hard-earned place in the annals of film animation history. Conceptually birthed by gothic master Tim Burton and brought to life with the most incredible vision and detail by Henry Selick, it stands as an incredible marriage of creative energy and top-notch artistry.Released in 1993, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" actually predates the collaboration that truly saved Walt Disney Pictures - Pixar's ""Toy Story."" Both films were groundbreaking in their own right - ""Nightmare"" for stop-motion and ""Toy Story"" for computer-generated animation - though as the latter became mainstream, the former continues to be underrated, even today. Regardless, both films show the world-building ingenuity that we've come to expect from animated films in the 21st century.What helps keep ""Nightmare"" timeless and relevant, however, is that it's steeped in holiday spirit. Halloween and Christmas are two holidays that evoke their own special, unique energy and Burton's story pounces on marrying their two wildly different aesthetics. It's Selick of course, who really sees (and seizes) this opportunity in bringing Halloween Town to life with aplomb.Of the film's many vivid components, however, its story doesn't hold up as well nearly 25 years later. Fortunately, at an unusually brisk 76-minute runtime (likely due to stop-motion's time-consuming nature) it doesn't need to. The film can afford to survive on its whimsy, artistic sight gags and inventive musical numbers. That said, it's not among the more emotionally compelling holiday-themed films either.Yet anyone who has ever been in position to be jealous of Christmas or idyllic depictions of Christmas celebrations might identify with Pumpkin King Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon, singing vocals by Danny Elfman) and his longing to do something different and truly extraordinary. Or if not Jack, then Sally (Catherine O'Hara), a Frankensteinian creation longing to serve her own desires for once, not just that of her maker, the Evil Scientist (William Hickey). Helping us better acquaint ourselves with these characters are Elfman's songs. Although most of them do serve an expository purpose, a few take a moment to bring us closer to Jack and Sally.The musical nature of ""Nightmare"" shows the film's ambition. It's hard enough to make a film requiring this much detail, let alone set it all to music. Elfman and Burton have been a perfect pair throughout their respective careers; Elfman simply gets the fantastical gothic tone Burton has made his career on. His songs are a great match for the material, even if you can't recall how most of them go in the same way you can the songs of the traditional animation musicals of that time period.In family entertainment, story generally proves to be most important. ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a remarkable exception, getting by on its tone, visual effects, creative world-building and the Halloween and Christmas spirit. At times when it feels like a glorified animated short film, best to just remember all the ground it broke as the first mainstream and widely successful stop-motion animated feature.~Steven CThanks for reading!

I liked it but...,"...I probably missed something while watching ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" because I didn't find anything so special as people claim to have seen it. It's good overall, very watchable but I really didn't felt the hype of this animation. And the tragic thing that I heard was people saying that the only people who'll enjoy this film is the ones who watched since they were kids and grow up watching over and over again. Fine. I watched it more recently, I'm young but not a kid but I still think that a movie can and must win all kinds of audiences otherwise it's just silly and forgotten.The concept, the story of Jack a scary Halloween creature that discovers Christmas and gets involved with the holiday but doesn't know its meaning quite well, is very original, funny. Perhaps more suitable and interesting for a live action film than a animated feature. This is a cartoon for kids but at the same time it's not, it's dark, kind of creepy. And a movie idealized by Tim Burton wouldn't be a Burton film without Danny Elfman's songs. Sometimes the songs work quite well, other times it's annoying and overlong.Perhaps the aspect that bothered me on this film, or the thing that didn't make me enjoy it more than I wanted is the direction of the film in charge of Henry Selick. Selick directed one of the worst films ever made, a tiny awful film called ""Monkeybone"", a waste of time, space, money, completely misguided film and since then I was afraid of watching something directed by him. Here in ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" he was good, knew how to direct and control the stop motion technique, and was able to capture Burton's ideas. But had this movie directed by Burton himself, with more control on things this would be a better and greater film as it is. Burton is present here but not as much as his presence in the wonderful ""Corpse Bride"" (which I enjoyed so much more).The voice casting was very good although they haven't included any famous actors behind the characters voices. The great special effects were nominated for the Oscar (lost out to the undefeatable ""Jurassic Park""), the soundtrack is good, has its great moments most notably the song ""This Is Halloween"" played at the opening, that song should have been nominated for an Oscar.Again, I wasn't so excited as many people claimed to have been while watching this experience. It's good but not great. I've seen better animated films and that's only my opinion. Now I'm gonna have to face many people who suggested the film to me, and they were so thrilled while talking about it, and when they ask me what did I find about it I'm gonna frown my face a little, say it was okay, and they're gonna kill me for doing that.

I first saw this three months ago when the DVD was being re-released, and it was actually better than I expected. I didn't think that it would be a musical, and I am a huge fan of them.

An Entertaining Tribute to Two Distinct Holidays,"I don't think I need to describe this film, since everyone knows that this was the brain child of Tim Burton while he was working at Disney. Sure, Henry Selick ended up directing it and not Burton himself due to his busy schedule, but there's a reason everyone calls it a Burtonesque masterpiece. Only someone as strange as him could've thought up an idea for a film where both Halloween and Christmas come together to tell a story. Now with all of that said, I totally get why people love this movie, but I personally deem it as just enjoyable more than anything else.Right off the bat, the animation really makes this movie come to life. The numerous creatures of Halloween Town look like they came right out of the mind of an imaginative soul obsessed with the macabre, and they translate very well to stop-motion. In addition, the character animation is quite fluent and lively, as each distinct spook acts differently from one another depending on their physical appearance. The contrasting sets consisting of the creepy and dark looking Halloween Town and the bright and colorful Christmas Town also deserves much praise for the usage of strong lighting and cinematography. Also, the moments of composited hand-drawn animated ghouls add a variety of styles to the film without going overboard.That being said though, as beautiful as the film looks, the story itself is not as strong. The film centers around the pumpkin king of Halloween Town, Jack Skellington, who wants something new besides celebrating Halloween. Once he discovers Christmas, he wants to embrace the holiday but then ends up realizing the grass is always greener on the other side. This kind of story is really weak in concept, and the plot itself is rather practicable. However, the execution is what elevates the feature, as it's told through musical numbers and just exploring the fantasies of each holiday. The film manages to blend holiday cheer and grim humor together to build off the conflicting views of the two dreamlike lands through creative visual artistry and gags.As for the characters themselves, Jack is well meaning in his desire for something new, but his ambitions make him too naive for his own good. It's funny how Disney tells us that we can do whatever we dream when this film's moral proves that isn't always the case. Sally works well as the film's pure voice of reason by desiring excitement while being concerned for Jack's well being. The other characters range from demanding yet too self obsessed like Dr. Finklestein and the Mayor, to malicious and annoying like Lock, Shock and Barrel, to bland yet wise like Santa Claus. The only other memorable character in the film has to be Oogie Boogie, mainly due to his delightfully charismatic performance reminiscent to that of a Cab Calloway performance in a Betty Book cartoon, although his motives don't seem to be fully touched upon.Lastly, the songs by Danny Elfman work as both storytelling devices and entertaining melodies on their own. Some set the mood of the individual fantasy world like This Is Halloween or What's This, while others establish the characters and their inner feelings like Jack's Lament, Sally's Song and Poor Jack (yeah, the titles suck, but what can you do?). But without a doubt, the song that steals the show is Oogie Boogie's Song, as it displays the coolest and most creative visuals in the entire film whilst being highly entertaining and camp in its own regard. No matter how you feel about any of the songs, nothing else could have elevated the paper thin story as much as them, for they add all the necessary momentum and entertainment value needed for a film like this.So overall, while I wouldn't put The Nightmare Before Christmas on as high of a pedestal as others would, I still find it to be an entertaining experience to watch during two different times of the year. Even if the story is relatively simple and the characters are hit or miss, the originality expressed through the visuals, comedy, music and mix of the aforementioned holidays makes the whole feature worth a watch. I hope whoever loves this film has the time of their life rewatching it again during this month...or in the next two months, give or take. As for me, while I have seen better animated films in the horror fantasy genre, this still reflects the fun side of Halloween and Christmas like never before.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Saw this in the theater. It couldn't end fast enough,Saw this when it was first released and I remember being completely bored and waiting for the film to end.

Solid entertainment for older children and adults.,"Pumpkin King Jack Skellington (voiced by Chris Sarandon) is a big guy in his home land of Halloween Town. One day, during his travels, he comes upon a series of trees with doors that transport the individual to various holiday worlds. Jack enters Christmas Town and loves what he sees; he's enchanted. Therefore, when he returns to Halloween Town, he implores his fellow citizens to come up with their own version of Christmas. As one is likely to imagine, he doesn't quite ""get it"", at least when it comes to his idea of good gifts. To add to the situation, Santa Claus (who Jack and others think is named Sandy Claws) is abducted, and when Jack fills his place, chaos erupts.Producer Tim Burtons' imagination is in full bloom here, and is vividly realized by director Henry Selick. The animation is slick and gorgeous. There are a wealth of stylish visuals, both in Halloween Town and Christmas Town. The characters and their designs are delightful, from Jack to Sally (voice of Catherine O'Hara) to the evil scientist (voice of William Hickey) to the fiendish Oogie Boogie (voice of Ken Page). Caroline Thompson (""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Corpse Bride""), wrote the screenplay, with Michael McDowell (""Beetlejuice"", ""Tales from the Darkside: The Movie)"" credited with the adaptation. Another frequent Burton collaborator, Danny Elfman, supplies the many catchy songs (this viewers' favourites are ""What's This"" and ""Oogie Boogie's Song"") and also performs the lovely singing voice of Jack. The eclectic cast also includes Glenn Shadix (who voices the mayor) and Paul ""Pee-wee Herman"" Reubens (who voices Lock).Some younger children may not take to a lot of the more freakish designs and characters, but otherwise this is fine family viewing, with a fairly trim story and running time (77 minutes all told).One point of interest for people may be deciding whether to watch this during the Halloween season, the Christmas season, or both, for that matter.Eight out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Sorry. Ut the 3d version is the BEST version!! Phenomenal!!,Nothing I can say that hasn't already been said only thing I'm adding is that the 3d bluray is absolutely stunning it's a shane more studios didn't take 3d seriously and give it the actual 3d effect and not just attach that it's a 3d movie to get the extra 3.00 some 3d movies are so superior in 3d it's not even close but due to the MANY low quality 3d it killed the 3d market. Let's hope when the 3d master mr James Cameron releases the avatar sequels people will remember how amazing 3dis and it'll make a come back.

"So far, so bad","Maybe I was spoiled by ""Corpse Bride"" but I am having great difficulty getting though the first twenty minutes of this film.If I remember correctly, Danny Elfmann is the composer. The weakest part of the film. All of his music sounds the same.If it sounded the same in the way that one could recognise a signature like Mozart or like, maybe it could be passable, but when Elfmann makes his play, it has the feeling of sameness as when one slips on a dog's calling card on the sidewalk.I have no idea why anyone would use his infantile music in their films, especially such directors as Burton, whom I otherwise very much admire.Maybe he is simply cheap and reliableÂ—not bad qualities in themselvesÂ—but aren't there any musical composers in Hollywood?",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A Spooky and Festive Delight: A Review of The Nightmare Before Christmas,"I recently watched The Nightmare Before Christmas, which was an enjoyable experience. The movie perfectly blends Halloween and Christmas themes, making it a unique and fun film to watch during the holiday season. The animation is also top-notch, with the characters and settings being beautifully crafted and detailed.The music in the movie is another standout feature, with memorable songs like ""What's This?"" and ""Kidnap the Sandy Claws"" that are sure to get stuck in your head for days. The story is also exciting and engaging, with a great message about embracing who you are and finding your path in life.However, the movie could have been a bit longer and explored some of the characters and themes more deeply. Additionally, while the movie has some darker elements, it is ultimately still family-friendly, which might disappoint some viewers who were expecting something more mature.Overall, I would give The Nightmare Before Christmas a solid 7 out of 10. It's a fun and unique movie with great animation, music, and a positive message, but it could have benefited from more depth and exploration.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A Fun Halloween Tale--But Basically a Musical,"I had never seen ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" until this year (2016). It came out while I was in high school, and I think at the time I was going through a ""I'm too old for cartoons and kids movies"" phase. I'd been wanting to see it for several years now, but every year Halloween would come and go and I would miss it.In fact, that's one important thing to know about this movie. Before I saw it, I always wondered if it was better to watch at Halloween or at Christmas. I'd now answer that question with a definite ""Halloween"". The movie is about a character from a village that is oriented around a Halloween theme who wanders off one day and discovers a series of portals to other holiday-themed towns. This takes him to Christmas-town, where he decides he wants to bring Christmas back to Halloween-town. But, before it's all said and done, he discovers that the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence, and that the holidays don't mix well. That being the case, the movie has a lot more Halloween-oriented characters than Christmas-oriented ones, so definitely watch this during the former season.Another thing you might want to know going into this movie so that you'll get the most appreciation out of it is that it is in fact NOT an animated film. Or at least it's not a cartoon or a computer animation. Rather, it's stop motion. All of the scenes in the movie were shot on site, with props that were used to make the set. Taking that into consideration certainly adds to the appeal of the movie, and it really is quite a feat for filmmaking.As for the story and the plot of the film, it's not terrible. Indeed, the plot itself is somewhat becoming and certainly novel. However, the movie relies heavily on music and song, making it basically a musical film. Musicals are my least favorite genre of movie (even though I realize it's a very popular thing to do for a kids movie), and so it was hard for me to get into this film.Still, all things said and done, I have to give this movie a strong 7/10 stars. It's certainly a fun, well made film. Just not in the upper echelons of my favorites is all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Think of It As Rudolph Mixed In With The Works of Edward Gory,"I'll start this review off by saying that, even though this was one of the first movies I ever saw, I was pretty darn terrified of it. I would often watch this film at my cousins' house growing up in the mid 90s early 2000s timeframe and when the monster from under the bed with his sharp teeth and red eyes made his first appearance, I cried in fright and called for mother. But growing older, and increasingly fond of the works of Tim Burton, I have come to be obsessed with this film and now it's one of my all time favorites. I like to think of this film as a mixture between the works of Edward Gory, the Rankin Bass Christmas stop motions such as Rudolph, and the many Charlie Chaplin movies you can think of. I mean, come on! You can't deny that Jack Skellington moves a lot like Charlie Chaplin. He has that diverse style that parallels that of Chaplin, and it obviously took several thousand shots to make him move. In my eyes, The Nightmare Before Christmas is Tim Burton's macabre imagination at it's finest, and really bridges the gap between beloved holiday classics and twisted, dark style Halloween thrillers.The stop motion animation, what can be said about it that hasn't already be said a gazillion and a half times already? Director Henry Selick and his crew really put sweat and blood into this animation and as a result, gave us animation that has a very German expressionist vibe to it, much like silent films like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and 1925's The Phantom of the Opera. I just love how the characters move, Jack especially, and that they move in such a stylized, non human way. After all, these characters live in a fantasy world, so they should move in a stylized fashion rather than a realistic fashion. The design of the characters is also something to write home about. Every character has their own unique look and no two look the same. From the slinky, slender design of Jack Skellington, to the wide, twisted look of the Mayor, each character has their own characteristics and mannerisms and stick out from one another like soar thumbs. Even jolly old Saint Nick himself has his own thing going on, giving us a look of Santa Claus we had never seen before.What I also dig about the film is the overall design and atmosphere. From the curved gravestones of Halloweentown, to the real world's crooked dwellings, everything is non linear and gives the film a storybook quality, making you feel like you're within a dream or nightmare or someone else's subconscious. Even Christmastown has a touch of rugged scenery, right down to Santa's workshop. I also must praise the camera angles and perspectives represented throughout the film. Many scenes are shot in silhouette or in darkness and add a sense or tension, remorse or suspense to whatever scene is taking place at that moment. The scene where Jack walks up the hill, silhouetted against the massive yellow moon is in my opinion one of the crowning moments of Tim Burton's movie career and is the most iconic piece of imagery out of the entire film. It's very much like how ET and Elliot were silhouetted against the moon in the bike flying scene in ET or how the Batwing was silhouetted against the moon to create the bat signal in Burton's Batman.The music by Danny Elfman is by far one of his best works, blending in humor as well as dark, twisted choices of words. Danny Elfman must also be praised for doing Jack Skellington's singing voice, adding great depth to the character's point of view and inner torment. I also enjoyed Ken Page as Oogie Bogie, a character who was obviously inspired by Cab Calloway and his appearance in a 1932 Betty Boop cartoon. He portrays the Boogeyman as a sick, villainous tyrant who really enjoys inflicting pain on others. He also enjoys snacking on small insects when he himself is basically a huge pile of insects in a sack.The Nightmare Before Christmas displays a style not seen too often, and really showcases what can be done when hard work and dedication is put into stop motion animation. It also shows that Tim Burton has a pretty dark, yet child friendly imagination in his brain and isn't afraid to let it spew onto film. In my eyes, it's his second best masterpiece next to Edward Scissorhands.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Perhaps it would work better as a short,Burton wrote a poem and Disney was planning on turnning it into a 30 minute short back in the 80s.

The perfect blend of my two favorite holidays,"Tim Burton may not have directed The Nightmare Before Christmas, but his fingerprints are all over it in the best way. The man has a knack for simple stories told mostly through the visuals that very few filmmakers can match. And as far as visual storytelling goes, this is among the best. Everything, from story to character development, is presented either through the visuals or through the many songs. In terms of the visuals, the stop motion animation in this is absolutely unparalleled. The designs of the characters, the different ways they move, the contrast between the dark and twisted Halloween Town and the beautiful and colorful Christmas Town, and moments like the famous scene where the hill unwinds as Jack walks down it that leave you wondering how they did it in stop motion, all add up to a film that's a true visual marvel. The characters are absolutely unforgettable, even those without a lot of screentime like the villain. And while the story isn't anything deep, it's got a great message about appreciating what you have while still trying new things.The score by frequent Burton collaborator Danny Elfman (who also voices Barrel and provides Jack's singing voice) is some of the best work in both men's catalogs. It finds the perfect balance between whimsical and magical, and dark and ominous. And the songs are a total joy to listen to. They may not follow the usual structure you find in most songs, especially in musicals, but that just adds to their uniqueness. Plus, it leaves room for the aforementioned story and character development. My favorite is probably Kidnap The Sandy Claws, a song so catchy I simply can't help but sing along every time.Overall, The Nightmare Before Christmas is a one of a kind gem of a film that I watch every year, in October and December. It's not mostly a Halloween or a Christmas movie. It's an exact mix of both, which makes it all the more unique and all the more memorable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Classic Before It Became Popular Again.,"Re-watching this classic might hurt the original viewing for some. The animation is not as smooth as the recent flicks like Corpse Bride or even Wallace and Gromit. Still, the originality and musical entertainment is still there. I had a friend who loved this movie, then the recent popularity with kids wearing clothing from the film apparently ruined it for him. How does that happen, don't ask me.NBC is a film that is indeed a classic and rightfully so. The animation may be stiff today, but I think it works for the world they've created. These aren't humans we're seeing. It's horrific creatures from the mind of Tim Burton and it has his stamp all over it. Seeing two worlds collide, such as Halloween and Christmas, is marvelous to see. Watching Jack as he first enters Christmas Town is like watching a kid discover the world around him when he learns to walk.The musical numbers are catchy and serve the story well. The film is a lot faster paced then I remember. It flies by really quick and before you know it Jack is delivering the toys of horror to kids all over town.The Oogie Boogie man is really well done and is still scary today as he was when I first watched this film. The voice over work is crisp and alive with emotion. It's not just some celebrity lending their voice to an animated film, it's skill voice actors doing their thing.The originality and entertainment factor in this film are high and you can see the passion the filmmakers had in bringing this nightmare alive. Burton gets a lot of credit for this film, so much that many people mistake him for the director. Instead it was Henry Selick, the director of the film Coraline. Some credit should be thrown his way, but alas, his name is hardly ever mentioned. Just ask the two guys who directed the Star Wars sequels....",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Gives You Exactly What You Would Expect From Tim Burton,But With More Heart And A Beautiful Christmas Theme,","The Nightmare Before Christmas is a terrific movie with a great story,some amazing characters and a nice Christmas theme that make it a very enjoyable movie to watch during the Christmas holidays.I would say you would have to be a little older however,at least older than seven,as this movie can be very dark and might frighten a younger audience,as there is a strange mix of Christmas and Halloween and some of the characters are very strange,but as you are older you can understand the mix of themes and enjoy the movie.I am not a huge fan of Tim Burton,I find his movies very dark and creepy,I don't like his remake of Christmas stories,like Charlie And The Chocolate Factory and Alice In Wonnderland,but when he contributes to the script,he usually adds some heart that makes it enjoyable,the last two movies I mentioned are just dark versions of light hearted stories.The Nightmare Before Christmas,the story and the characters,was all made by Tim Burton,and that makes the heart involved in this movie,and I would say the greatest movie Tim Burton was part of is this.Jack Skellington is tired of celebrating Halloween every year and when he stumbles upon a world that celebrates a holiday he has never heard of called Christmas,he decides to take over the holiday along with his gang from Halloween town.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

I guess I just do not get it, though. While I enjoy the movie, love the songs (Danny Elfman is amazing) and think the animation is spectacular, it is unclear to me how it has the strong cult following it does or how it has made the Top 250 movies list.Maybe I am just rebelling because I instinctively dislike things that are popular. But I just am not clear on the mass appeal.

However, as someone who only knows Halloween, his idea of Christmas doesn't align with what Christmas really is.The story is told through a set of musical numbers that usually describe the emotional state of Jack Skellington, but also cover other characters like Sally and the rest of the town.The film basically tells us what would happen if Halloween and Christmas collided.

A Musical Delight,"The Nightmare Before Christmas was a big hit when it first came out in the early 90s and has had generations of fans ever since. In 2006 there was a 3D re-release of the film and it has become a cultural icon: even people who have not seen the film knows elements of it, you can buy merchandise and hoodies with Jack Skellington and I even met a girl at a costume party dressed as Sally from the film. It has even be parodied a number of times.Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon/singing voice Danny Elfman) is the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town. Ever year he leads frightening festivities and he does it successful. But he is growing tired of his role and he longs for something fresh. After wondering off, Jack stumbles into Christmas Town and after seeing the joy and happiness of this world Jack decides he wants the creatures of Halloween Town to take part. He gets the creatures to prepare everything and kidnaps Santa Claus (Ed Ivory), but Sally (Catherine O'Hara) has a vision that his noble plan will end in disaster.The Nightmare Before Christmas came out of the mind of Tim Burton, starting as a poem before being expanded upon. This is one of Burton's best films, which is ironic because he was only the producer and created the story. But The Nightmare Before Christmas is still very Burtonsque in its look, very dark and Gothic look. Henry Selick is a great stop motion animator and his designs are great for the film. The animation flows brilliantly and I particularly like how the characters moved.The story is simple and very focused, and Selick delivers a fun fast paced film. It has a short running time but it works and Danny Elfman wrote and song some brilliant songs. The songs are energetic, fun and simply delightful and it what you would want from a film like this. They are catchy but more importantly well written and fitting to the animation and the events of the film. The Nightmare Before Christmas is also funny, whether it's a funny line or a set piece like with the Easter Bunny. Even if you do not laugh out load this is a film where you will have a smile throughout.The characters are also great, being developed and likable. The creature designs are wonderful and imaginative, whether it's the main two characters or many of the supporting characters, like the Mayor or the wheelchair mad scientist. There are influences of other works, like Frankenstein, classic Universal monsters and classic children's fears and stories. The Nightmare Before Christmas is a creative film, with wonderful art, a great Gothic design and is just an uplifting experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Not bad,"(To start off, I have rated 100s of titles, and have reviewed less then 5. This review will contain NO SPOILERS.)Its about a town that Has Halloween once a year but seemingly every day. But this movie is pretty good. The story mind you is not horrible, but not very good whatsoever, and is strictly for children to enjoy. Characters are average, besides Jack who actually is very likable. There's a mad scientist, main female, dog, main antagonist; the works. The reason I give it an 8 is because its an animated musical, and mainly because of the Opening Song and a few others. Its pretty cool to watch around Halloween (or Christmas) and watch the first, very addictive, song on Youtube a bunch of times. If it sounds good to you, then rent it by all means, but I say just go to Youtube and watch it full, which might still be there, or type in ""This is Halloween"" (first song) So Happy Halloween in 2 weeks!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"Flawed, but a triumph of stop-motion animation and production design","Jack Skellington, Halloween Town's most prominent citizen, discovers Christmas and attempts to take over Santa Claus's duties one Christmas Eve. The plot may be as thin as the film's protagonist, but that's really not the point. ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" luxuriates in Tim Burton's brilliantly warped imagination without apology, and rightly so. From the first frame to the last, it's an absolute marvel of production design. But even more importantly, it's a fine tribute to the art of stop-motion animation, especially in this day and age of CGI. As fluffy as the story is, it's still quite engaging, with a fair amount of wicked humor (both visual and verbal) thrown in for good measure. The weak link here is Danny Elfman's song score, which is flat and not well-suited to the story. In short, it frequently stops the movie in its tracks.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Just plain fun!,"The thing I found hardest to take about The Nightmare before Christmas was classification. When watching a film I like to know as early as possible what I am likely to be in for, so I can prepare my mood so I am most likely to enjoy what is in store. This is a film where I struggled. From the opening I was stuck in a peculiar state of purgatory with words and concepts swimming around my head. Is this a musical? Is it a cartoon? Is it horror? Is it something that can just be put under that special label of ""Tim Burton thought of it"". I felt once again like I was being sucked into the old debate of whether a Jaffa Cake is indeed a cake or a biscuit. The one thing I am certain of is that it was visually stunning, and the script and voice acting left little to be desired.The method used to capture the puppets movement and emotions is surprisingly expressive and emotive, while the majority of the songs are infectious and will force you to crack the sort of smile you normally reserve for those precious moments when someone you know well truly surprises you. As is to be expected some of the songs are a little less stand out and detract from the atmosphere slightly, but nothing film breaking. The real stand out character for me was the delightful cameo of the bogeyman, whose appalling yet endearing persona was a treat.Now let's talk about what this film isn't. This isn't a film that you should take too seriously. It is very light on plot and those expecting anything more than the most basic fairytale story will leave bitterly disappointed. It also isn't very long, but this really does work in its favour, leading me nicely onto my closing thoughts.Touching back on my point of classification, this film cannot be classified as it is in defiance of all common genres, but this didn't trouble be at all like I had imagined it would. The short length of the film lends it to have a relentlessly fast pace meaning it has an uncanny knack of holding your attention and keeping you fully immersed. The way it has been shot is so interesting that it matters little that the plot cupboard is bare. The Nightmare before Christmas is a short trip into fantasy land, where the strangest things happen and you are in kept awe almost constantly. Although not without its flaws this is definitely a welcome diversion from most other films developed on this side of the world, reminding us all not to take ourselves too seriously.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"The ultimate holiday crossover, and a landmark for animation.","*I personally consider this to be the ultimate November movie (combining the holidays of October and December), and that is why I have written this review now in particular.The reason this film is so highly lauded is how it merges to beloved times of the year together. Nightmare does this in ways which extend beyond the lavish aesthetic, the atmosphere of both seasons permeate the film throughout. The creepy joy of Halloween and the whimsical timelessness of Christmas are perfectly balanced here. It could stand alone for both seasons, but manages to stand for them both. This is a huge accomplishment.The films flawless atmosphere comes from it's excellent musical score, perhaps Elfman's very best, and it's outstanding stop motion animation. Laying down the foundations for stop-motion films to follow, the stunning colours, expression and imagery here are truly amazing and hold up well today, despite Henry Selick's own ambitious follow up stop-motion films. I must in particular praise the film's palette, a trait which is held by most of Selick's films.The film's story is also classic. Simply told, but incredibly effective. This is largely due to the myriad of enjoyable musical sequences spread throughout the runtime, all of which contribute to the story and tell it's tale largely through the music itself. The story is also made stronger by the film's great cast of talent voice actors and singers, who work a fairly predictable story into narrative magic.It almost feels like this film has always existed. It so perfectly encapsulates two seasons and is so classic in its imagery and storytelling, it is hard to imagine a world without Nightmare. A milestone in animation, musicals and holiday classics, and the perfect ambassador for the dreary month of November.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Not a Fan of the Style, Still Enjoyable","The Nightmare Before Christmas proves to be such a unique concept for a family movie. This fantasy story suggests that each holiday has a world of its own outside the boundaries of society, and two of those worlds collide in this movie: Halloweentown and Christmastown. The result creates an entertaining story of discovery and exploration.Meet Jack Skellington. Though he is not the mayor of Halloweentown, he has a huge influence over the inhabitants as he practically runs Halloween. Something is missing in his life though, and nobody can understand this except for Sally, a woman held together by stitches who is basically a slave to her creator. When Jack comes across Christmastown by mistake it gives him a sense of great wonder and hope. Sadly, when he tries to explain his feeling of warmth and happiness this world has created for him, the inhabitants of Halloweentown are only interested in whether the holiday Christmas has any scary aspects.The premise is very unique and sends a good message to children. However, while the story may be intriguing the dialogue seems to be simplified in order to target the attention span of children whereas good family films would challenge children to grasp dialogue with intentions that do not involve moving the plot forward or dialogue with vocabulary that is challenging to them. The way conversations or dialogue is handled in this film is slightly better than dialogue in The Polar Express (which isn't saying much).The art direction of the film is not for everyone, but while it is dark it is not creepy enough to scare children easily. Well, maybe very little children, but certain characters like Jack or the goofy mayor with two faces keep children distracted from the Gothic style of the movie.The best aspect of The Nightmare Before Christmas by far is the music. Each musical number is given great attention by Danny Elfman and the other writers and proves to be a very effective story- telling device within the film. If there's anything the audience will remember walking out of the film it would undoubtedly be either Jack's sad song about lacking meaning in his life, or the very upbeat and popular ""What's This?""This isn't your typical family film, but it has redeeming qualities and proves to be a very good musical.3.0/4.0",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

My only negative is Elfman's Music.,This got under my skin when they showed it at daycare so I have to give credit not only for the singular texture but also for just that special touch in the toning.One of the best movies with Burton's name attached and it goes to figure he didn't actually write or direct it; this was the quintessence of what made me call myself a fan until he horribly lost his way in his later career: macabre and fairy-tale sentimentality harmonizing well.I suppose the fanbase resonated to it as an anthem for the strange and sinister among us who just want to feel the snug embrace of Christmas without swallowing the lie that we aren't fine just the way we are as our own freaky selves.So yeah.,7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Simply NOT a classic. Does not age well.,"I am doing a 2016 review of this movie. I was a child when this movie came out and I personally loved it at that time. I am reviewing this movie now in 2016 for the young generation of today.I have a young son and his two friends were over, we were looking through movies to watch and they all decided on this. We got maybe 20 minutes in and the CHILDREN...not me, decided to turn it off. This movie simply does not stand the test of time.Some have said the animation is very good...well by the standard of today it is not, also gauging by the kids reactions the first comments were 'this looks old'. The camera is jerky and hard to watch, the scenes are all dark and bland,""halloween town"" looks like a little cardboard set (not in a cool stop motion animation type of way). The animation department could never fit more than a few characters on the screen at the same time.I do not really know how this movie became some cult phenomenon but watching it with children in 2016 it is flat and boring. The animation is underwhelming and stale. I like the songs but the kids did not.I give it one out of ten because children will simple be bored with a movie like this now. We switched the choice to Power Rangers Christmas and they all liked that a lot more.",1.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Love,As a little kid I watched the same old Christmas movies and I grew to hate them. This was probably the first Burton film I can remember seeing and I've never gotten tired of it and it is both a Christmas and Halloween movie. If you haven't seen it then you're missing out. The movie itself is amazing but knowing that it is clay animation and not animation makes this film so much more amazing. It also amazes me how the idea for this didn't come from a book but from the man's head. You also need to watch the special features and see the things Disney took out and his other ideas. Burton is swimming in talent. Disney didn't think the young audiences could handle everything so be sure to check it out.,10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
the best,"the best Christmas film. it is the verdict who remains valuable after I see it. not only for the great animation but for the delicate grace to serve the basic idea. it is a film about magic and about courage and about desire. and, sure, about precious lessons about yourself and the others. a film who remains unique because the cultural references and the genius of Tim Burton are good pillars for a story for every expectation. and The Nightmare Before Christmas has the virtue to be the perfect fairy tale for new generations, fascinating, touching, seductive, naive and wise. a film about meanings of holidays, tradition and limits. proposing a great character, it change everything. and this does it the best animation . or, only, the best animation about the real significance of happiness.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Best Movie Ever,"Ever since I was very little, this has been my favorite movie of all time. I absolutely love Halloween, it's everyday for me, and this movie is, as many would probably argue, the most classic Halloween movie of all time. Not only that, but it can also be watched at Christmas time, though I see it as more of a Halloween movie because even though there are Christmas scenes and the movie takes in November and December leading up to Christmas Eve, with only the first portion of the movie being on Halloween night, even the Christmas scenes in the movie have more of a Halloween vibe to them than Christmas. The movie follows Jack Skellington, the king of Halloween, who after years of the same routine of scaring people, gets tired of this and finds out about Christmas. In his efforts to celebrate Christmas in Halloween Town, instead of celebrating it in a joyful way, they turn it into a fright filled holiday. The stop motion animation is outstanding in this movie, as well as the displays. Each Holiday Town shown in the movie, Halloween Town and Christmas Town, capture the feelings of each holiday so well. Christmas Town is very bright, happy, and joyful with many stripes and bright colors. Halloween Town has a very dark, depressing, and eerie vibe, with oddly shaped gothic buildings, tombstones, and lots of blacks, greys, and oranges. The music in this movie is also amazing. There is only one true Christmas song in the movie which is ""What's This"" song by Jack Skellington when he discovers Christmas, but it stills helps establish the feel of Christmas time very well. There's many bells, harps, and other light hearted music in this song. All of the other songs in the movie are Halloween songs, and they are amazing. They each have very dark and creepy sounding instruments used, such as violins, cellos, saxophones, and other instruments of that matter. This movie is an absolute must see for any Halloween fans or anyone looking for a great movie to watch around Halloween.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"Re-make in 3D, not as nice","I saw this movie in 1993, bought the DVD, have the soundtrack (legally bought back when CD's were still in style), and consider it a great movie for kids and adults alike.That being said, seeing in 3D was a disappointment. Even catching a matinÃ©e, I had to pay $9 because the glasses were an extra $3. All the 3D did for me was make things in the background look more in the background. There were a couple of ""ooooh ahhhh"" 3D moments (pumpkins flying at you and snow falling), but that didn't take away from the discomfort of the glasses squeezing against my head.The music was still enchanting, the stop motion flowed very well and I *strongly* encourage this movie.

A movie with feelings,"Looks like Tim was REALLY inspired when he produced this movie. The music was well done when he directed it, also the voices were well chosen, Jack had a good voices. This is the unique Christmas movie that Disney has aired and that I like. The plot was a bit used, but Tim knew how to fix it and make it look cool and good. I remember the first time I saw this movie I just loved it. In the scale of the 10 stars, I would give this movie 10/10, besides I can't describe how awesome this movie is. This one, and moulin rouge are my only favorite musicals. Also Oogie was a good villain.

An Amazing Animated Film With Compelling Characters and Superb Music,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is directed by Henry Selick (no, not Tim Burton), and is the story of Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King, and the leader of Halloweentown. After years of seeking something more than simply scaring people annually, Jack eventually wanders off in thought, and stumbles across Christmastown. He decides that Christmas is a superior holiday to that of his Halloween, and sets up a plot to overthrow Santa Claus and control Christmas as his own, with good intentions for the special day of the year.Growing up, The Nightmare Before Christmas was one of my favorite movies. I had every song memorized (except for ""Something's Up With Jack,"" I could never remember that one), and loved every single character in the film. Rewatching it recently, it isn't a perfect film, but it sure is a really good one. From the fantastic music, to the compelling characters, to the incredible stop motion animation, everything about The Nightmare Before Christmas is simply amazing.To start by jumping in, the hands down best thing about Nightmare is the music. The music, composed and partly sung by Danny Elfman (voicing Jack when singing), is absolutely fantastic. Almost every song is excellently written, and choreographed (with small figures on tiny sets, may I add). However, the music is also where my one problem lies. There is one specific song, called ""Making Christmas,"" a song in which doesn't hold up a fight against the other songs in the film. To be completely honest, it isn't a bad song, but, in comparison to the other songs, it stands out tremendously. Besides that one song, however, the music is superb, and a soundtrack worth buying.The characters, along with the actors who voice them, is another astounding thing about The Nightmare Before Christmas. Jack Skellington is, in my opinion, one of the greatest animated characters of all time. He stands up there with Grumpy (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs), Simba (The Lion King), and Woody (Toy Story). He is perfectly well rounded, and is a flawless example of a character that literally anyone can relate to. The entire audience can find at least one attribute of Jack's that that specific person can communicate with. Jack Skellington is one of my personal favorite animated characters of all time.All of the other characters are great as well. Sally, the rag doll, and Jack's sort-of love interest is an amazing character. Her insecurity on whether or not Jack's plan of owning Christmas is a great attribute that adds a subtle layer of conflict between her and Jack. The actress that voices her, Catherine O'Hara, does great with her character, especially in the song she sings, entitled ""Sally's Song."" The main villain of the film, Oogie Boogie (or the Boogie Man) is a very clever choice for a villain for a movie that takes place in ""Halloweentown."" His weakness, which I won't spoil, was a brilliant idea to add to the film, and gives a layer of humanity to a seemingly unstoppable villain. His voice actor, Ken Page, does amazing in both speaking and singing. Every other supporting character is great as well, but just aren't filling as big of roles as the three actors/characters mentioned.The stop motion animation is nothing but the best. For every second of film, around 12 shots were taken of the small sets. That is absolutely incredible. The time that the filmmakers spent on getting the exact right shots and movements is substantial, considering it took three years for the film to be completed. For every person involved in the filmmaking, I commend you on the excellent job you did, this coming 23 years after the film's release.In final conclusion, The Nightmare Before Christmas is an amazing animated film, a great holiday film, and an excellent movie all around. I implore anyone, except for a hand full of small children, to check out this film; it's, simply put, brilliant.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Enjoyable But Overrated Burton Animation,"While this story was creative, it was not original-there have been similar inter-dimensional/realm travel plots throughout cinematic history. The animation is not the masterpiece it is played up to be, the dark Disneyesque songs, and the Gothic Tim Burton theme combine to make this something we've never quite seen before, while it is still reminiscent of scores of other works...Beetle Juice for one, which is another well-received Tim Burton Gothic rom/com with the darkling edge.In my opinion, this is one of the more over-rated animations ever. James and the Giant Peach came out about the same time, and it was much better done, but without the Gothic story and setting.Enjoyable, but overrated. And the animation isn't all it's made out to be.It rates a 5.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Both my favorite Halloween and Christmas movie (convenient!),"I seen this movie like dozens of times already, and I never got old from it. This is the first movie that I have heard of a man named Tim Burton, who done films like Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands and Batman (1989).Anyways, the songs in this movie are so catchy. The first song 'This Is Halloween' is personally my second favorite song to use on Halloween, the first being Michael Jackson's 'Thriller'. The visual style of the movie might not be look innocent but it didn't cross the extra line of being too scary for your children. Plus, it looks amazing. The characters were memorable, the animation is fantastic, and again, the songs are just so catchy.It may not the best movie I've ever seen, but man it had a big impact on me when I was a kid.Score: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A Masterpiece that gets better every time you see it!,"This film is an audio and visual treat. It delivers masterful animation combined with great music and fabulous songs. Danny Elfman is an under-appreciated and underrated film composer who creates wonderful music in multiple films and has yet to be awarded for his terrific work. Here in ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" he really shines with catchy tunes and a magnificent score. The visuals are unusual and brilliant and Tim Burton's crew deserves high praise for their fastidious work and meticulous animation. Burton and Michael McDowell have created a truly unique story and director Henry Selick puts all these elements together with perfection. The characters are unforgettable: Jack Skellington the Pumpkin King (Voiced by Danny Elfman and Chris Sarandon), Sally the Frankenstein-like doll who pines for Jack (Voiced by Catherine O'Hara), nasty Dr. Finkelstein the mad scientist (Voiced by William Hickey) and other ghosts, ghouls and vampires are wonderfully created and performed. It is a classic that will only improve with age and viewers will catch something new on every viewing. The Blu-Ray DVD is absolutely stunning.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Wonderfully spooky and unforgettably original - a creative and imaginative masterpiece of stop motion art,"I'm not a big fan of musicals. But then again, this doesn't really feel like a musical - it's better. This is an amazing work of art created by talented people with a exceptionally creative vision. The aesthetic, the visual style, the designs, the songs, the sound design, the voice acting - everything is impeccable. The character and set designs are probably the most stand out feature of the movie. Some of the character designs are actually pretty creepy. Which is funny because this is meant to be a kids movie, yet it feels like it's intended for adults. The stop motion is flawless - it's very fluid and smooth. It's a shame there's only a handful of filmmakers that dabble in this art form. I wish they would make more stop motion movies.There're nothing quite like this film. It's a world that exists only within this movie and it's what makes it so special. It's an incredible technical achievement. All the pain staking detail that went into making it is definitely evident. The world they've created is so unique and filled with so much distinct character. I want to take a vacation there for a couple days and marinate in all of its wonderfully spooky aesthetic. It's both charming, cozy and creepy. Exactly what Halloween feels like as a kid. There's so much to look at in every frame and shot. It's packed with so much detail it's almost overwhelming. There's never a dull or boring moment in this movie. There's always something happening and the pacing is constantly moving forward. The songs are incredibly catchy and memorable. It's a holiday film that celebrates both Halloween and Christmas. Overall, Nightmare Before Christmas is a wonderfully creative and imaginative work of art that begs to be revisited at least once a year. Raw Score: 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

It's difficult to decide what was worse - the irritating singing, the absence of a coherent plot, or the lack of meaningful dialogue.

Greates Animation Musical Ever,"I saw this film when it came out here, i was six or seven, and damn I was totally bewitched by this movie.

There's also a lot that can go wrong when animating, such as the figure falling, even if it's held down.
It also has outstanding songs. Songs like ""This is Halloween"" And ""Town Meeting"" show how the town thinks, while ""Jack's Lament"" and ""What's This"" show how jack feels for most of the film. My favorite song from this movie, though, is Oogie Boogie's song. There's something about how he sings it that makes it better every time I hear it.

"One of the most timeless animated features to of have ever been made, Burton's creative Masterpiece","Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of the most stunning animated films I have ever seen. Both for the time when it was released, and it's film-making style of animation which is stop-motion clay animation, has broken barriers well and truly that has never been seen before in the type of animation. The visual design in Nightmare is truly something to see, creating a very clever sense of mood and feel, due to it's brilliant use of colour such as the dark and grey colours of Halloweentown creates it's spooky debonair feel, and the bright colours of green and white snow create the feel of holiday cheer in ChristmasTown.It's not just the visual design and feel of Nightmare Before Christmas truly makes it an Oscar winner. It's really about the increasing level of depth that is portrayed in the leading characters: Jack Skellington and Sally: The Rag Doll. The songs and general speaking parts of both Jack and Sally contain songs a lot about how they truly feel about the lives they lead in HalloweenTown, and go on really an emotional journey to discover themselves, such as Jack, when him and his sleigh gets destroyed, Jack truly finds his inner self, and that is what makes Nightmare Before Christmas stand out from all the rest.Overall, The Nightmare Before Christmas is a true breakthrough in animated films, and truly shows how it should be done.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Forever Iconic,"Although very short this film manages to be one of if not the most iconic Halloween film as well as being one of my favorite Christmas films as well. The entire soundtrack in the film is outstanding. That and the stop motion animation is easily what makes the film as memorable as it is. Had it been animated and not stop motion then it would not at all be as great as it is. It would still be good and the music would still be great, but the stop motion gives it that creepy vibe and it makes it so much more fun to watch. It's honestly really short. Like really short. Not even 90 minutes. That just means the film manages to get everything it needs done in that time frame while still managing to create a multitude of memorable characters and a few iconic ones as well.Overall, The Nightmare Before Christmas is a great film. I could listen to the soundtrack all day it's so amazing every single song SLAPS. The stop motion in the film is so creepy yet so beautiful and oddly satisfying at points. It's one of the greatest films to ever do it. So many amazing shots. Every stop motion film strives to be at least as good as this one. So that says something. Definitely check this out if you haven't already. It's the greatest Halloween X Christmas crossover you'll ever see.Saw this in Universal Studios City Walk in Orlando.

Strange and eerie but it's very good,I've watched this 1993 American stop-motion animated musical dark fantasy film about several times and it's very good.

The songs are kinda unforgettable such as 'This is Halloween' and 'What's This?'My sister stills loves The Nightmare Before Christmas and she stills has it on DVD as well so she got it for Christmas in 2002 when she was fourteen years old.I'd say Tim Burton is a total genius.

"An Overrated, but Visually Beautiful Classic","Tim Burton's ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" has gone from a cult status to mainstream classic with 20-somethings (and others) who have fond childhood memories of this film.In true Tim Burton form, however, ""Nightmare,"" is certainly visually stunning, bursting at the seems with raw imagination, and, of course... grossly over-hyped.Once you get past the remarkable and unique animation and visual style, what you're left with is a rather boring tale that you'd frankly have to be under the age of 12 to truly enjoy (I was 11 when I saw it, and didn't like it then, either, so go figure). Sure, the premise is wonderful on paper: The ""king"" of Halloween, akin to Easter's rabbit and Christmas's Santa Claus, becomes disillusioned with Halloween and discovers Christmas, becoming inspired to take over duties for Santa Claus...but royally jeopardizes the new holiday he has grown to love when he kidnaps Saint Nick.Yes, it's definitely a cool idea. To see it play out over the course of an entire feature length film? That's something else entirely. Especially if that film happens to be, essentially, a kid's film (and despite the spooky visuals and dark tones, let's not kid ourselves, this IS a children's film). What starts out as a great idea for a plot turns into a boring and predictable ride through a world you can't wait to get out of. The musical aspect, which is a large part of what makes this film, is another complaint. I'm sorry to say it, but these songs are largely laborious to endure -- contrived pieces that drone on annoyingly and seem rather uninspired. Normally, I'd let this sort of thing go, but when the music is such an integral part of a film (and this film IS a musical), it's hard to ignore. I'm sure many would disagree with me on this, but think about it -- besides the decent ""flagship"" track (""What's this?"") are you really going to catch yourself humming any of the songs from this film after only one or a few viewings the way you hum tracks from Jesus Christ SUPERSTAR or TOMMY? I don't think so.Yes, the film is annoyingly over-hyped, overrated, and to some extent, overdone. All negativity aside, though, I do think this makes a wonderful children's' film -- surely, one of those special flicks we can all relate to that stick with us and perhaps even shape us when we see them in those magical and formative early years. As I mentioned above, the visual style is unforgettable and the tone and feel of ""Nightmare"" accomplish what I believe Tim Burton set out to achieve (as far as ""tone and feel"" are concerned). This is definitely one I think I'd been better served to watch at the age of 4, 5, 6 or 7, but unfortunately it came out a few years too late, I suppose.For kids -- a winner. For adults -- well, bring your watch. You may be checking it a few times.",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The Nightmare Before Christmas,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is without a doubt beautiful, the first 10-20 minutes you will be enthralled by the visuals no doubt. Once you get used to it though. The movie does start to become a little ''flat''.The stop motion is stunning, it really is, and I was just wishing we'd go back to Christmas Town for a for more moments there because just wow.. blew me away. Besides that though the character design is so enjoyable. I especially loved the weird children, and their silly walks. It felt rightfully whimsical and weird, exactly what you want in a Tim Burton movie. Directing was great too though the format showed some limitations at times. Feeling somewhat restrained. The intro though... incredible opening.Music is good...sometimes. I really don't wanna hear those kids sing again though, that was awful. There's to my surprise a lot more music and sections where characters sing, in retrospect I wished they toned it down just a bit. As it did feel like too much for me. All the songs from Jack worked well though. But I'm not really running back to add it to my playlist.Story is quite simple, but also felt slightly rushed towards the end, maybe it spend a little too long with Sally sometimes. It just that the mid section of this movie is kind of forgettable to me.Characters are great though, loved Jack, Sally and that crazy docter she's with. The Major was very memorable too.

What's this? The dream about Christmas (cinematheque) (vhs) (screen),"As ""Hook"", this is a movie that i have discovered first by its soundtrack, having bought the import during a family trip to Paris in 1993 (the same where we have seen ""Schindler""). After opening it, I was surprised to see a booklet of songs, having just expected a score from Danny. At the listening, I find it wonderful, all the more than Danny is a great singer as well. Frankly, i don't remember my feelings when I watched it at its release, except than i bought the VHS later. Now, this is the movie that opens the Burton's festival at the Cinematheque, thus i can tell today.For me, it stands as a unique and inventive piece of imagination, sublimated by the score, an incredible art and an astounding craft. It's dark but funny as well (I love the one-eyed mummy), frightening and tender. The characters show a lot of soul and it's such amazing for just plastic ones. I still don't understand why Danny's musical effort has been snubbed at Oscars because he delivers such great themes and lyrics! The story is a jewel because the idea of a magic place made of holidays is just totally fairy tale. If the action is sometimes a bit vague (what's is the secret of X-Mas?), the screen is so full of details that it's a non-stop feast for the eyes. At last, the movie is paired with ""Vincent"" (a bit too sad) and with the ""Frankenweenie"" that is maybe the best short I have ever seen: as in ""Nightmare"", it's filled of emotion and it has all the themes that Tim would film in his long career!My conclusion is that Tim and Danny should have done a ""Nightmare 2"" instead of ""Corpse Bride"" where the alchemy doesn't repeat.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Creative and unique,"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to combine the holidays of Christmas and Halloween? If so, Tim Burton answered it in 1993 with his release of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". The film opens in Halloweentown with shots of ghosts, skeletons, vampires, and witches. Jack Skellington is the pumpkin king and a highly respected citizen. He is lonely and sad, though, because he wants something more than scares and frights. When walking through a forest, he comes across a door that takes him to Christmasland and he instantly knows; this is what he has been looking for. What he decides to do is this: replace Santa this Christmas and put his own spin on things. To do it his own way. This movie, inspired by Tim Burton's poem, is enchanting to look at and the animation is unbelievable. However, don't be expecting a lot of Christmas cheer in this holiday story because it is lacking in that aspect. Also, being a Christian, I found the lack of any mention of the birth of Christ disappointing. However, Christmas is portrayed as something special, so much so that Jack can't even explain it to his friends. And that in itself shows that Christmas is not a regular holiday like any other. Jack's intentions also are good, for he wants to give and make people joyful. Though it is not perfect, I still think it is quite a good movie, primarily because of its creativeness and originally, both of which are qualities that always appeal to me. I also highly recommend reading the original poem or even better, listening to Christopher Lee read it with the animation and art from the movie. You can watch it on Blu-ray or DVD and I actually enjoyed even more than the movie. I also found it on YouTube. The poem itself is available in a beautifully animated storybook that I will be sure to purchase.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Perfect for my Halloween this year,"I decided to give it a try this year for Halloween, and I didn't have high expectations; for some reason, being a Tim Burton movie I thought it was just going to be gloomy. Ended up absolutely loving it. It,s short, sweet, weird, creative, musical-y, animated, halloween-y and christmas-y. I wasn't bored even for a second, nor was I hyped, and that is what I appreciate nowadays - a film that entertains me without squuezing me dry of energy. Kids might appreciate it too.For all of you Jack Skellingtons out there, in search of answers in life through the ""Scientific Method"", I would recommend watching this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Pretty good?,"The world is full of terrible holiday musicals, good holiday musicals, and failed holiday hybrid musicals. Most of them are lazy and the ones that come out nowadays tend to be artificial-sounding and miserable affairs. This one does a whole lot of worldbuilding to justify the connection of 2 holidays and character establishment to make us care about the invented Halloween characters. The music is functional, but the styles are varied in the way that supports the story and moves it along while allowing for showcases of the animation department's incredible skill.

A stop-motion animated classic from the mind of Tim Burton,"Tim Burton is considered as one of the most greatest director's out there. He has done some great movie's like, ""Sleepy Hollow"" and ""Edward Scissorhands"". But there was one film that has been considered as not only Tim Burton's greatest film, but also one of the greatest animated films ever made. The animated film was called, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"".What I love about this film is the animation. It's very imaginative and interesting to see Halloween and Christmas combined. The film also has some nice song's from Danny Elfman (He did the music for Edward Scissorhands and Corpse Bride). The character's were also interesting including the villain, Oogey Boogey (Yes, it's a weird name. But hey, it's Tim Burton). He's a walking bag and his body is made out of bug's (Creepy, huh?).""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", is a great animated film that's really worth watching. But it might freak little kid's out.

Great one,"From a distance of a week pass, I must say that this film or cartoon or whatever is really great!I liked the mood of it. It is dark, it is gray, it is kinda spooky and kinda Frankenstein meets some Disney cartoon. It is especially notable in the two main figures in it. And the figures of them and everyone else in the film is just awesomely done! Hands down, it is perfect.I may not be sure if it is appropriate for the kids and if they would understand it, but for adults it may be a bit 'too childish' if you only expect some scare or to be more 'mature' ( though I guess the main theme of love is mature in itself).The only thing that I did not quite like ( though it is not that I disliked it completely) is the singing / musical part. I know it would be hard to express those emotions and thoughts otherwise, but... Nevertheless, it is great, so nine from me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The film that changed animation for ever,"Childish in the surface, but very mature on the bottom. Stop-motion animation finally became a reality and a success on year 1993 with Tim Burton's ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". This movie was destined to reach the top, it had a high-grossing feature manufacture and a critically-acclaimed film nature. Burton's dark and unique view of reality was fundamental and, maybe, the element that made this movie work. Nevertheless, few people give credit to the real element that catalyzed the whole project: Danny Elfman's beautiful soundtrack. Songs were catchy, were deep and were a total hit, not only on movie music's world, but on international level.It was Elfman himself, that gave the unforgettable voice to Jack Skellington. Even though, much of this film's economical success was a consequence of Disney's publicity.

Simply a masterpiece!!,"Where to start and how to finish with this masterpiece!!Absolutely brilliant!!Watched it first time around 2004 and now I came back for this classic just to remember the old days..Tim Burton and Michael McDowell did an excellent job delivering a thrilling, scary, romantic and fun story in our screens.Jack Skellington has become an icon.A movie character that everyone recognizes simply because this masterpiece is so enjoyable from start to finish,that someone can't help but sing along every time he/she re-watches it!!It's been 21 years since its release and yet no animated movie/musical has surpassed it in writing and directing brilliance.The songs..Oh my God the songs!!!They raised an entire generation.So catchy, so meaningful!!The dark creepy atmosphere of the entire movie blends so well with the general meaning of holidays.Every single second in this movie is epic.It is art of the highest levels that we do not see nowadays unfortunately.Danny Elfman is spectacular with the music and voice acting and everything gives us an unforgettable experience that we feel obliged to share with the generations to come so they can see what a perfect animated movie (and not only) means.Simply terrific!!!Do not ever try to reboot this classic!!Ever!!An easy 10/10 for me, one of my favorite movies of all time!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Even though the movie wasn't really that violent, I was so darn scared of it. I couldn't smile at all when I was watching it. It was just that scary.

Hail to the pumpkin King,"Directed by henry Selleck The nightmare before Christmas takes us to a world where all the holidays coexist in the same universe. Through a magic forest through magic doors we enter the world of Halloween town where, it's Halloween 24 seven everything is dark morbidly Gothic and creepy. It's here we meet the pumpkin king himself jack Skellington who everyone adore and respects for keeping the spirit of Halloween alive and well. However Jack himself feels That after year after year of doing the same routine he feels that his life has grown tiresome and bored he wishes for something different. That's when he accidentally comes across one of the doors that leads to Christmasworld. Where he discovers the concept of Christmas and Santa Claus. Now Jack inspired wrapped by Curiosity wants to hiJack Christmas, and tries to show the world his meaning of Christmas. Honestly I could say what pretty much you've heard from anybody about this movie. The visuals are stunning, it's animation was unique at the time for a feature length film. That to the point ended up launching a small side genre for stop motion animation. The songs are memorable and its characters are memorable. I'm sure you probably heard all that. Despite all those things being true there are still things to be said about the film. It is unique It takes the two most polar opposite holidays and mix it in a unique story that surprisingly works. If anybody tried this now a day it would just not happen. It's been stated that Burtonout right doesn't want any sequel
to this, because he sees it pointless and would possibly tarnish this film. This film is a one shot thing that could never be captured twice. I like that it doesn't really feel dated even after all these years alot of the dialogue does come genuine with having to resort to such things as pop cultureal references. There are quite some clever in jokes like the mayor literally being a two faced politician. When speaking of the character Jack himself while unknowingly in the the wrong,about taking over Christmas he does have good attentions, and he tries to grasp the concept. All he really wants is this something different in his life it doesn't make me a bad person. Though I do like how he basically says screw it I'm not gonna try to understand it, I'm just gonna do my own thing and it make it better. Jack's actually voice by two actors Chris Sarandon does the speaking role, and Danny Elfman who wrote the songs and score, provides the singing voice. Another of my favorite Moments in the movies when you meet oogie boogie. The whole song number he has stands out to me personally. The rest of the songs they're all difference in their style mirroring each other. From this is Halloweens more dark and spooky and then you have what's this? Which is all bright and colorful really makes it look like you've almost jumped into a completely different story. Though this is the only song that is dark but also tries to mix color in there with the glowing neon and the casino theme. I also just really love oogie boogie I honestly wish he was in more of the movie. That really part of the small issues about the movie it really not that long only like an hour 20 minutes. Certain things like oogie just feel tacked on and brush aside. Such as Jack and sally romance she's a very nice character and rather sad if you think on her situation, but the romance between them is pretty one-sided. I guess that is the overall idea of the film is Jack grows as a character, and realizes want he has. Overall the film is great and while it won't appeal to everybody it does hold as a staple in animation for its creative concept and style. It a film always great to put for the holidays or even whenever.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Disney meets Tim Burton.,"This is an animated musical produced by Tim Burton and Walt Disney Pictures, with direction by Henry Selick, where Pumpkin King Jack Skellington of Halloween Town is bored with repeating the same routine celebration every year for Halloween, and decides to try something different. He stumbles into Christmas Town, and, delighted with the cheerful and spirit of the joyous holiday he sees, he decides to share in some ideas back home in Halloween Town. However, things don't go accordingly to plan and he indirectly gets Santa Claus kidnapped.Filmed in brilliant stop-motion animation, this is a clever story that clashes Halloween with Christmas. At 76 minutes long, this movie is fast-paced with an exciting plot of Jack Skellington trying to fix his stumbles of trying to mix in Christmas themes with Halloween, to a race against time to rescue Santa Clause from the Oogie Boogie so that gifts can be delivered to the children in time for Christmas. All the voice-acting were brilliantly done and a few of the songs were haunting and catchy, especially ""Jack's Lament"" and ""The Oogie Boogie Song.""There are some scary ghostly-themed images, and some childish moments, but overall, it is a film for all ages.Grade B",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Pure brilliance. one of the few great animated family movies outside Disney,"Please note that Disney had no part when it was made (no logo or copyright on VHS release) I am guessing it owns rights now.Disney and Pixar have the most great animated family movies. Very few exist outside. The only ones I can name are Polar Express, Shrek, Iron Giant, and this. Nightmare is brilliant. Each camera angle (yes I am referring to camera angles in a stop-motion movie) is brilliant. They movie the camera unlike most claymation/stop-motion animated movies. Danny Elfman took a 7 star movie and used the music to perfect it. All characters are likable. The plot is brilliant. Tim Burton's poem is awesome. Everything looks cool in a strange and surreal world. The only flaw is how quickly people figure things out. Considering its a kids movie that can be let go. Other than that this movie is flawless. I am fourteen and I still love it. 10/10. My favorite film of the 90s",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The Pumpkin King,"Greetings again from the darkness. Somehow it's been a full 20 years since this groundbreaking film was released. It's a rare combination of cult and holiday, and even all these years later, it's incredibly entertaining. It shouldn't surprise anyone that the lead character is a societal misfit who means well. After all, the story is based on a Tim Burton poem.While watching the film, what strikes me is that this was a totally unique and creative world designed by Burton and director Henry Selick. Mr. Selick is a stop-motion expert known also for Coraline (Oscar nominated) and James and the Giant Peach. Complimenting the fantastical look and characters are the witty songs penned by Danny Elfman. Mr. Elfman is now one of the most prolific and successful composers working in the movie industry. At the time, he was better known as the front man for the party band Oingo Boingo (his Batman score changed that!).Since Pixar took over the animated world, we have come to expect major stars as voice actors. In Halloween Town, we instead get Danny Elfman (singing) and Chris Sarandon (speaking) teaming up for Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town. Catherine O'Hara is effective as Sally, Paul Reubens (Pee Wee Herman) stands out as Lock (of Lock, Shock and Barrel). The two most outstanding voice performances come from the late William Hickey as Dr Finkelstein (mad scientist), and Broadway star Ken Page as bad guy (and worm-infested) Oogie Boogie.There has been debate on whether this is best served as a Halloween movie or Christmas movie. The desire and hope to bring positive change to the world seems to fit the Christmas spirit, but the goblins and ghouls are sure to provide a nice scare for young kids. Especially fun are the ""new toys"" created by the work crews in Halloween Town as they prepare for a good will holiday they don't quite understand.Whatever your preferred time of year, this one is to be appreciated for it's creative look and imaginative story and songs. Rather than being created to sell toys, this 3 year production changed the standards for animation films ... that's the gift that keeps giving every year!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Very inventive,"A stop motion animation musical conceived by Tim Burton. Jack Skellington (voice of Chris Sarandon)is the Pumpkin King who plans and runs Halloween each year. It goes well--but he's bored and wants a change. He discovers Christmas and is overjoyed. He wants to run Christmas too but just doesn't realize that Christmas isn't Halloween. Sally (voice of Catherine O'Hara), a stitched together creation, realizes that Jack is wrong and tries to stop him.Bizarre movie (to say the least) but a definite one of a kind. The stop motion animation is beautifully done and some of the visuals are incredibly inventive and effective. Also the songs and music (by Danny Elfman) are lots of fun and perfectly fit the movie. The ""Boogie Oggie"" number is a highlight. My only problem with this is a problem I have with other Tim Burton films--it's a bit too dark. I know Burton likes it that way, but this is aimed at kids and I can see some of the younger ones easily being scared of this. Still it's tuneful and there's always something to look at. Also it doesn't overstay its welcome at about 75 minutes. I give it an 8.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
One of the Greatest Stop-Motion Animated Movies Ever Made!,"""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is one of those movies that is part of my childhood, and never I find this movie boring or get sick and tired of it. The movie is about a talking skeleton name Jack Skellington who is getting tired of Halloween, and is wanting to do something totally different. So, he discovers about Christmas and decides to try it out. Jack gets the people of Halloween Town to make Christmas, and does for what he has to do on his own. I really love this movie, and it is a heck a lot of fun to watch. I always remember this movie from beginning to end. Tim Burton has created these extraordinary characters that are fun and interesting to look at; so, here he really achieves it. I know he didn't direct this movie, which, of course, the movie is directed by Henry Selick who would go on directing ""Coraline"" and ""James and the Giant Peach."" He does a fine job directing this movie as well as keeping faithful to what Burton envision it. However, when you watch this movie, it really feels like a Tim Burton movie if Burton may have ghostly directed it or something like that. Chris Sarandon does a great job for voicing Jack Skellington as well as Catherine O'Hara for voicing Sally. Everyone in this movie for voicing these characters all did great on their own. The designs of the sets and characters are so darn remarkable, and the the stop-motion animation is incredibly well done. The songs and music by Danny Elfman are really far beyond from being good; they are so memorable like ""This is Halloween;"" ""Making Christmas;"" ""What's this?;"" etc. Many of you would like to know if this movie is either a Halloween movie or a Christmas movie; it just depends on what you make of. To me, personally, I think its both and I always get in the mood when it comes to both Halloween and Christmas at the same time. If you haven't seen this movie, check it out! ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is one of the greatest stop-motion animated movies ever made, and it is one of Burton's greatest achievements!

"An overall charming combination of Halloween and Christmas, albeit a little overrated","This is a very famous stop-motion animated film, one which achieved both critical acclaim and commercial success. I first saw a trailer for it probably around the time of its release, or shortly after, and could tell right away that its title was obviously based on the title of the classic 19th century poem, ""The Night Before Christmas"". However, I never watched any of the film until December 2007 (I think), but even then, I only saw a bit of it. I didn't actually watch the whole movie until last year, just a few days before Christmas, even though it appears it was originally released for Halloween in 1993. With that first viewing, I was disappointed, and certainly didn't understand the massive appeal, but with a second viewing nearly a year later, it did get better.All holidays have their own separate worlds, with entrance portals in trees! One of these worlds is Halloween Town, which is inhabited by different types of monsters who celebrate Halloween every year with a good fright. The leader of this celebration is a skeleton named Jack Skellington, but another October 31st has just gone by, and he is tired of the same routine year after year. His woes send him wandering out of town and into the forest, where he comes across the entrance to Christmas Town. He opens the door and is sucked in, but really likes what he sees on the other side. The other residents of Halloween Town have been wondering where Jack has gone, but he soon returns, much happier than he was when he left. He begins to share his knowledge of Christmas with the other monsters of the town, hoping to get them to help him celebrate this holiday for a change, but they can't seem to fully understand it.The intro of this movie shows us the place in the forest where each of the holiday entrances are located and features an opening narration by Edward Ivory. This narration is far from perfect, as Ivory tends to speak too fast. The intro is followed by the film's first musical number, ""This Is Halloween"", which is a pretty good and intense song to start with. The stop-motion animation makes ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" a visual treat, with well designed sets and figures. Christmas Town looks gorgeous as we watch Jack discover it, and I wish more scenes took place there. A number of characters stand out, including Jack Skellington, voiced well by both Chris Sarandon, who provides his speaking voice, and Danny Elfman, who provides his singing voice. Most of the voice acting I can't complain about, and that includes Edward Ivory as Santa, as he is definitely better in that role than he is as the opening narrator. The musical numbers can be a little weak, and mostly aren't really that memorable, but I guess they could be worse. The film does feature a decent amount of suspense, and there are some pretty humorous moments, such as the mischievous Lock, Shock, and Barrel accidentally bringing back the Easter Bunny to Halloween Town instead of Santa.Before I watched this movie last December, I thought there was a good chance it would be a ten out of ten in my book, just like it is to so many other viewers. However, that certainly wasn't the case for me, which became clear shortly after I started watching. After that first viewing, I wouldn't have been able to rate ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" any higher than a six, as I found it to be a severely flawed mess, and after that, I couldn't hope to ever be able to rate the film higher than an eight. Fortunately, it now is an eight out of ten for me, so watching it a second time did help, and the film didn't seem so messy to me this time. I still can't join those who consider this 1993 animated blockbuster to be an absolute masterpiece, but I can recommend it. It may be too scary for really little kids, but for older kids and people in other age groups who like stop-motion animation, are Tim Burton fans (he had a major part in this, even though he didn't direct it), and want an entertaining film that combines Halloween and Christmas, this highly imaginative fantasy could be well worth it. You could probably watch it around October 31st OR December 25th and find that it really fits in with either occasion, which is not something that can be said about any other films I know of!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
wonderful,"Ironically this is my favorite of all Christmas Cartoons, I cherish each time I spend watching this movie, it is my all time Christmas recipe to a Merry Christmas. Leave it to the team at Halloween Town to make jingle bells sound dead and horrific. Based on a poem written by Tim Burton in 1982, The Nightmare Before Christmas is a musical fantasy horror stop motion animation, which features the Stop Motion director Henry Selick (James and The Giant Peach and Coraline 2009).Disney first decided to make this movie as a short 30 minutes TV movie, but later decided to go ahead and make a full length animation but released it under their Touchstone Pictures Distribution name and not under their Walt Disney name because they feared, since it was a dark horror animation it will not be well received. The Nightmare Before Christmas became a hit critically and commercially, and Burton has had a time convincing Disney to drop the idea of a sequel whenever it came up.The movie plot is about Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king of Halloween Town, who was bored of doing the same thing over again, year in year out he has remained the pumpkin king, so on one lonely stroll he stumbled on Christmas town, saw the joy all around and decided to give Santa Claus a vacation, by kidnapping him, and he breathed a new dawn into Halloween Town where they will take over Christmas and Halloween it up.Due to Burton's busy schedule working on Batman Returns he was not available to direct this movie so Henry Selick was called upon to do the honors. The maker constructed 227 puppets for the film and Jack himself having close to four hundred heads to display his speech and emotions.With most of the film being songs, the voice of Jack was played by Chris Sarandon for speech and Danny Elfman the film's composer provided Jack's singing voice.The Nightmare Before Christmas was a critical success as previously said, holding a rating of 96% in Rotten Tomatoes and making over 75 million dollars in the box office, compared to its 18 million production cost and due to its wide acceptance Disney has reissued the film under their Disney Digital 3-D format, it then became the first stop-motion animated feature to be entirely converted to 3-D.Here is a classic Christmas drama about Santa coming to the rescue, Jack Skellington and the crew of Halloween town, are always ready to welcome you whenever you come watching, just be careful to stay away from the Oogie Boogie man, and buy this DVD.www.lagsreviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A holiday classic,"In the worlds of the Holidays, Halloween Town has finished yet another Halloween with Pumpkin King Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon) hailed by the town's residents for Halloween being the ""most horrible"" yet. Jack wanders off from the celebration as he finds himself weary of horror and fear and has become disillusioned with Halloween and wanders off into the woods. Eventually Jack finds himself at several trees with doors, and opening a tree shaped door he falls into a snow covered place filled with joy and wonder known as Christmas town and finds it enticing. Jack becomes set on taking over Christmas with chaotic and unexpected results.The Nightmare Before Christmas was the brainchild of director Tim Burton who initiated the concept as a three page poem while working as an animator at Walt Disney Pictures in the early 80s. Following Burton's work on the 1982 short stop-motion film Vincent, Burton had considered adapting his poem as either a short film or a 30 minute TV special and showed fellow Disney animator Henry Selick sketches and character models made by himself and Rick Heinrichs. While Disney did initial consider developing either a short or 30 minute TV special from Burton's concept but studio management would eventually get cold feet leaving the project stalled while Burton would leave the company and become a successful feature director with back to back hits in Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice, and Batman. Following Burton's successes at Warner Bros., Burton regularly thought about The Nightmare Before Christmas and eventually learned Disney still owned the rights to the works and concepts. When Burton pitched a feature length film produced by himself with Henry Selick as director, Disney jumped at the chance as the company was not only in the midst of an animation renaissance with their animated event films making money hand over fist, but the association of a name director like Burton was seen as a big get for Jeffrey Katzenberg. Produced over the course of two years before its 1993 release, Burton was very hands off during the production with his involvement mostly just infrequent set visits (being busy with both Batman Returns and Ed Wood) and Henry Selick was very much in the driver's seat. The film was met with critical acclaim and modest box office making $50 million against its $24 million budget leaving Disney satisfied with the results. Over the years the film's reputation has only continued to grow with merchandise based around the film's iconography still very much in vogue as well as annual airings on TV around the Holiday season. The Nightmare Before Christmas is a wonderful movie that operates on pure magic and passion.The film's introduction creates a beautiful and magical world that is also nicely frightful as the opening musical number of ""This is Halloween"" features some fantastically elaborate motions and model work that creates a world that simultaneously creepy and inviting. From ghosts, to zombies, to vampires, to more outlandish creations like ""the clown with the tearaway face"". Nearly every frame of the film has something visually beautiful and with the unique look given to it by Selick's stop-motion animation you just can't help but get engrossed in the film.Story wise, the film's intriguing setup of the king of Halloween becoming weary of fear and screams and wanting to tackle Christmas is certainly a unique idea, and the filmmakers go full force with the premise. The plot is pretty simple and is primarily based on character and atmosphere rather than the innerworkings of plot mechanics which makes sense as Burton was inspired by the styles of holiday specials like How the Grinch Stole Christmas and the Rankin/Bass specials so Nightmare Before Christmas feels very much of that ilk but with a slightly twisted lens. The songs written (and sometimes sung) by Danny Elfman have become ingrained in popular culture and for good reason as once you hear any of these songs you'll remember them forever. The film hosts a solid set of eccentric characters with Chris Sarandon very good as Pumpkin King Jack Skellington, Catherine O'Hara as Jack's love interest Sally, and a host of others who populate the world created in the film.The Nightmare Before Christmas is just such a wonderful reminder of the magic and wonder of stop-motion animation and has become a holiday favorite we are all too happy to revisit for good reason. With so many great sights, sounds, and wonders I'm sure I'll continue to revisit this film many times over.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Hard to get into the movie,"I find a lot of Tim Burton's movies hard to get into; rented this one, but couldn't get into it. The animation is really weird. I like the characters & Jack Skellington merchandise; but I just can't get into the movie itself. The drawings are also really odd looking; for example, I have seen Coraline & Frankenweenie; I did like Frankenweenie, but that's the only Tim Burton movie I like.

A stone-cold classic,"It's hard to believe that I last saw ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" almost twenty years ago as its tunes and visuals are so vivid in my mind. Seeing it again in the cinema all of those happy memories came flooding back and my foot couldn't help tapping along to the music. If that's not the mark of a classic I don't know what is.What I hadn't remembered is that Tim Burton isn't actually the director. Instead he wrote the story and produced with directing responsibilities off-loaded to Henry Selick. The latter brings the source material to life through top-drawer animation wedded to a fantastic Danny Elfman score.In some respects it's actually Elfman's music that drives the film along with song after classic song. These rather make up for the fact that the film isn't really telling a story; instead it's a series of musical sequences based around Jack Skellington and Halloween Town.The end result is an animated delight that never gets old and appeals to young and old.

"Watch it in October. Watch it in December. Heck, Watch it in the Middle of Friggin' July!","""NBC"" is one of the best Christmas films ever, but it is also one of the best Halloween films. For a movie to be ""bi-seasonal"" like that, to me, is an amazing thing. And this semi-Tim Burton venture is not just for kids, it's for anybody. The story, while geared to two particular seasons, is accessible all year 'round, and the stop-motion animation will both take your breath away and leave you sympathetic to the devoted geniuses who had to pose the little figurines for each frame. Generally, this film's naysayers come from two places: they either dislike Tim Burton or dislike stop-motion (or animation in general). But if you keep an open mind, you'll realize what a fantastic piece of work this movie is.

Amazing movie,The best movie to really connect with is The Nightmare Before Christmas. With its incredible story telling and soundtrack you will feel every emotion that the characters feel and really feel like you are in the movie. When evaluating a movie one of the most important things to take note of is the soundtrack which helps elevate the story. The Nightmare Before Christmas' soundtrack does a great job helping tell the story and add more depth into the character's thoughts. Another important element to look at is the animation of the film. The animation in The Nightmare Before Christmas is a very technical process that was executed perfectly by the film's makers. Let's first look at how different the film is from other films. The last thing to look at when analyzing a film is story flow. The story does a great job in selling every character to you so that you feel like you have been friends with them all for years.,10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Tim is my god!,"I said it so many time before and I say it again, Tim Burton is my god! can he do a bad movie? Don`t think so.. So Nightmare before christmas, that wonderful movie is one of my favorite movies of all time! It is so excellent, everything is so good, the enviroment, the twisted mountain that becomes straight as he walks on it, the ghost dog the weird professor and the brave girl with body parts that come of! It is excellent! Tim Burton has made this movie so fantastic.. I can never see it to many times, I think I will see it now! anyway, for you who has not seen it, see it! //Sofia",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The Grinch gets outdone!,"This is a personal favourite. Although credited to Henry Selick, Burton's fingerprints are all over this, and like most Burton films, it gets better with repeat viewings. My only quibble with the video version is the opening narration. I can't remember exactly, but the narration on the soundtrack CD is by Patrick Stewart, and is vastly superior and more extensive than what is contained in the VHS version, and I seem to remember that Stewart's narration is contained in the theatrical release. Oh well, it doesn't detract too severely from the film, which is so subversive and twisted as to make ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" look like a fairy tale. Here we have a dark protagonist who wants to appropriate Christmas not because he wants to make the world as miserable as he, but because he thinks he can make it better. His misguided attempts to bring Christmas to the masses in his own unique way are so blackly funny, and such a refreshing change from the commercialistic style of the Santa Claus myth, that when he is ultimately thwarted, we feel sad that he didn't succeed; not because we're sick and degenerate, but because the current children's Christmas myth is so stifling, we all feel it could use a good kick in the pants. The Grinch cops out on this level and turns into a complete cheeseball. Long live Jack Skellington, and may his follies cause us to reexamine our own Christmas traditions.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Greatest movie of all time,I mean that. From the stop motion animation to the music. Oh don't get me started on the music I could write this entire review on just the soundtrack alone but alas I'll spare you with instead saying that from the story to the cast to especially the visual work this film is a must see for anyone that wants a good Christmas/Halloween film to watch. Not just because this is my all time favorite movie but also because it's absolutely fantastic and so much fun! And you will fall in love with every song. Even the background music that quietly plays is amazing. Halloween town is definitely not a vacation spot however. Lol.,10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Unpopular opinion,"This would be an unpopular opinion, but the movie is shallow and overrated. Don't get me wrong, it's great stop-motion animation, especially for the time, and character design is great, too, but that's all there is to it. And maybe a couple of songs.There is practically no story here. It's essentially like quite a few modern movies, especially those super-heros' ones (not only Marvel): things are happening, but they are happening more because authors chose to make them happen, rather than characters were following their desires in some way or form.I was not hooked by anything within first 20 minutes and was mostly forcing myself to watch this till the end. I was not a fan of ""Corpse Bride"", but even that one was much better in my eyes, since it did have a plot, even though a flawed one.",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Dont miss it, it's great","Magical, creative, memorable, genius, technical, unique... I think think of many other key words to describe this movie, it is one of my favourites of all time. Jack Skellington is king of Halloween, the world who creates our holiday. Well Jack discovers Christmas and tries to make it his own. What makes this charming story so special is a technique called stop motion is used, the whole movie is made up of singing and movie dolls. Sound a bit to much? Watch it, I bed you, you wont regret it. Danny Elfmans score is amazing, I used to listen to the soundtrack walking to school every day. And Tim Burtons story is just amazing, I love all his work.

Hail to the Pumpkin King,"Some viewers who watch Nightmare Before Christmas for the first time may not see at first why it's one of the most celebrated holiday films ever made. Yes the dialogue is basic, it's not super funny, and there's no real dramatic stakes involved. But that wasn't the movie's purpose. There's a reason why many past holiday specials, especially the classics from Rankin Bass, still stand the test of time. They went for simple yet inventive concepts and that's exactly what Nightmare before Christmas did. As simple as the story may be combining two holidays together like Halloween and Christmas couldn't have been easy. But the movie managed to make it work by showing how much these two holidays don't work together. And of course with the combined efforts of Henry Selick's directing, the brilliant imagination of Tim Burton, as well as the catchy song numbers Danny Elfman knocked right out of the park, we get one of the most unique and creatively imaginative holiday tales ever put to screen. I've Loved this film my whole life and will continue to make it a tradition to watch every October & December as I look forward to seeing Jack, Sally, Zero, Oogie Boogie, as well as every other resident in HalloweenTown every year. Merry Christmas and a happy Halloween to all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Okay visuals but lacks substance,"Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas is a visually stunning film, with its unique stop-motion animation and darkly whimsical aesthetic. The design of the characters and the world of Halloween Town is nothing short of brilliant, creating an atmosphere that's both eerie and magical.However, beyond its artistic appeal, the story feels lacking. The plot is slow and doesn't provide enough emotional depth or excitement to keep the viewer fully engaged. The musical numbers, while charming at first, begin to feel repetitive and fail to drive the narrative forward. While it's easy to appreciate the creativity and craftsmanship, the film ultimately feels more like an art piece than a compelling story.",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Defines the Talent of Burton: Whoa!!!,"Most people back away from this film for it's somewhat disturbing look. However, if one actually sits down and watches it. They will be literally Blown Away!!! Take Wallace and Gromet for example, though they have a much ""cornier look"" then Nightmare Before... does but it has the same basic principles. Completely stop-motion but with a unique edge and a much well developed storyline. The story doesn't have a message that we can relate to personally, but a message that just makes us think, ""Can you imagine if holidays collided?"" Though the thought maybe unbareable, it still is fascinating. I have always enjoyed this film and I think I'll enjoy it for years to come.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

A masterpiece!!,"I think this is the most wonderful movie I've ever seen. I first saw it in 1994 when I was a small child and it's been my favourite film ever since. The story, the soundtrack and the animation are superb. It's just perfect for all ages, a must-see movie. I'm so happy Tim Burton and Danny Elfman teamed up to do this movie because it's truly a masterpiece. Sometimes I still can't believe it's a Disney movie. Anyway, I haven't found a movie like this one in years so, I consider it a treasure in the history of film making. If you haven't seen it yet, well, what the heck are you waiting for??

100% A+ all the way,"This is the best movie I have ever seen and many of my friends think so too.  Just about anybody would love to see this film of a place where every day is Halloween, and every night, Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King, dreams of something more than all the tricks and treats.  After a long night of scaring the daylights out of everyone, Jack is bored, depressed, and longs for something more.One night, while wandering around in the forest, he discovers a Christmas tree door that leads to Christmas Town.  Now, it's only too obvious that Jack loves this idea where you make people laugh instead of scream, but he and his ghoulish friends don't quite get the concept.  (Those of you have seen this movie know what I mean.)Besides the animation and story, the music is just awesome.  Without Danny Elfman's songs and music, this movie would just dissolve into nothing. Danny has a way of picking just the right notes and instruments for each beautiful scene, and his voice is just GORGEOUS.  (Good ol' Danny sings for Jack, Barrel, and a few other characters.)  Man, that guy is TALENTED!!!!!!!!!My final reason for just eating this movie up is Tim Burton's cast of characters.  I'm not going through the whole cast, but I will use Jack as an example.  You can just look at him and know that he's just bored and curious and wants to obey his inner desire for something new and exciting.  He never meant to scare those children half to death, but wanted to give them a good time.  And I've had the biggest crush on him (and Lock) since I saw this movie for the first time.Overall, this movie desrves a 100% on everything, from animation to the story.  If you have not seen this, you are a poor, deprived soul.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A Childhood Classic,"The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) is a beloved classic among many. Produced by Tim Burton, the film is a dark fantasy musical. Its stylistic elements reflect that of other stop-motion movies by Tim Burton such as The Corpse Bride (2005), and Frankenweenie (2012) both of which are of a darker, spooky nature. The color pallet reflects each of the worlds explored. Halloween Town is displayed in shades of black and gray, with small pops of color here and there such as orange and green. Christmas Town is illuminated with bright, vibrant colors to show a stark contrast between itself and Halloween Town.The use of lighting in the film made the set look like it was a full movie set and much larger than its actual size, enabling the filmmakers to immerse the viewer in the fantasy world they created. The film's greatest strength was the stylistic composition, meaning that the intricate details of each stop motion character, as well as the details of the set were really what gave the film such recognition. It is quite visually entertaining. Another strength of this film was its score. The soundtrack, written by Danny Elfman, is quite memorable. The soundtrack flows well with the various scenes. The soundtrack is also used to emphasize certain characters throughout the movie, such as ""Sally's Song"" and ""Jack's Lament"", that of which play throughout the film when such characters are on screen. Songs like ""What's This?"" are used to further the story as a musical. The stylistic components of production are so significant in the film's popularity, rightfully earning the production such a high rating.Where the film does fall short though, is the basic plotline. The characters lack any sort of in-depth background story. The story itself is very basic, the music motivates the plot more than the actual dialogue. This could be due to the film being geared towards a family audience. Because of such an empty plot, I can see how some audience members could become bored while viewing the film. Some of the scenes are also a bit scary for younger audiences, hence the rating of PG; this factor also sort of places the film in a limbo genre wise, it is geared towards younger audiences but due to its darker nature, it does not exactly fit into a ""children's movie"" category.Overall, where the film falls behind is made up for because of the extremely detailed nature of the stylistic components. Because of its nature as such a visually intriguing film, it has become a widely loved and appreciated stop-motion film. Its gothic style groups it with other beloved films unique to Tim Burton and his work. If one is looking for an easy movie to watch around Halloween, with strong visual components, this film is perfect. To conclude, I rate this film a solid 8/10 stars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"A visually beautiful animated movie for grown-ups, with breathtaking score.","Tim Burton has always liked to do the unexpected.

Accidentally, he stumbles upon Christmas Town and is inspired to make Christmas more Halloweenish.There are three important elements to this film: 1) The story, 2) the beautiful visuals and 3) probably the best score ever written for a movie.

a work of genius,"This has to be the first and one of the best Tim Burton films I have watched when I was a kid. Surprisingly, the movie has a very simple basic story. In a little warped town, known as Halloween town, lives Jack Skelington. Jack, aka the Pumpkin King, grows tired and bored of his role in the world, organizing Halloween each year. So, he goes in search of something new and different to do to end his slump. He discovers Christmas town, and decides he wants to do that instead. From the start, its pretty obvious that the citizens or Halloween town can't do Christmas and begin warping and dementing it totally out of recognition. there is also a sub plot about a patchwork girl who is also trying to escape her role in the world. She is falls in love with Jack from a far. Anymore and I would spoil it.The plot, simple fairy tale, a bit of human quality ie trying to escape the boring blue collar life. but, really the plot has very little to do with what makes this movie special.It's the breath-taking 3D stop-motion animation! This is the very first movie to consist completely of stop motion. Probably the most grueling film technique ever, stop motion requires small figures that are positioned then photographed then repositioned and rephotograped over and over. This process is takes hours to create even a minute of footage. So, that explains alot about why each shot is so well crafted, since they spent weeks puting them together. This technique makes it very original, and very unique In a time when most movies were trying new computer animation and looking for a more realistic look. the filmmakers choice to go back to the herky jerky look of stop motion, was a bold and very different idea.A work of genius!Some of the things you will notice is there aren't really that many charactors. halloween town really has only about 10 or 15 residents, probably because the cost of creating hundreds of little firgures for every expression and movement they have. Jack alone probably had over 600 heads, for all the movements of his face. but, even with limitations like these, the movie succeeds in just about everything I think it set out to do. Its creepy and weird, scary and warped, yet has a kind of strange nice feeling. You have empathy for the charactors, even though they are dark and crazy. And if for no other reason, watch this movie for the cinematography. The sets are wonderful, the characters are cool looking, the music is great, and every shot is masterful. I find it easy just to forget the story and watch the pretty pictures.Is it a halloween spooky movie, or a warm christmas classic? who cares, its cool to watch! Tim Burton is truly a cinematic genius for coming up with such a fantastic idea and make a fantastic film out of it! He should, in 10 years times, receive an honourary Academy Award for his brilliant film career.

An all-too-rare treasure.,"One thing animators are able to do is create entire alternate universes from scratch.  And, sadly, they very rarely take advantage of this ability.  The best animated films are like travelogues filmed on location in other worlds, and one of the most downright astonishing of these worlds is to be seen in ""the Nightmare Before Christmas"".This would be an amazing movie anyway because of it's stop-motion animation, a dying art if there ever was one.  However, the story, characters and music are equaly memorable.  It doesn't hurt that Halloween and Christmas happen to be the two bookends of an annual period of holiday season euphoria for yours truly.  This, of course, is one of the movies I always must watch every holiday season to get myself in the spirit.Be sure to get the ""Special Edition"" video, by the way.  It's letterboxed and includes the two Tim Burton shorts ""Vincent"" (which looks excactly like an Edward Gorey book come to life) and ""Frankenweenie"" (a sublimely hilarious tribute to Shelly).",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The Corpse Before Bride,"Tim Burton's first full-length animation filled to the brim with so much emotion. Tim, Danny,and Henry have created the best film ever (along side Corpse Bride of course).The music is fantastic, and it is disgusting that Danny Elfman did not win any Oscar. The animation is ahead of its time and is so well crafted. the voice acting is brilliant and is probably one of the greatest voice ensembles for an animation ever. the set design is almost the same creepy yet fantastic one that you would've seen in Edward Scissorhands or Big Fish and also really envelops you in a whole new world.I love this film mainly because of its emotion and well-developed characters, and i wish the 'Best Animation' category existed back then, as it would have won for sure.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Being unique isn't synonymous with being good,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is undeniably one of the most unique Christmas movies of all time and also put a completely new complexion on Disney movies. The beautifully conducted stop motion technique, the catchy musical numbers that may not be counted as Danny Elfman's compositional masterpieces, but still make the movie a lot more entertaining than it would have been without them, and the weird sort of humour that isn't to make you laugh out loud, but have you chuckling almost perpetually. Nevertheless, it's still a bit disappointing that a movie this sort can still be boring here and there and the screenplay also isn't always successful in maintaining an acceptable balance between child-oriented silliness and adult-suitability (though I adore the Hamlet reference). Through that, difficulties arise as the movie ends up being too ridiculous for most adults and too scary for most kids in the target audience. But still I'd say that sparing one hour and fifteen minutes to see this truly one-of-a-kind movie can't hurt.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The very abysmal music drags everything down,"Pretty good story and visually the movie is neat looking, but the very abysmal music drags everything down.

A Family Feast,"In my review of Halloween, I said that October 31st is my favorite day of the year because of the excitement and the joy, but as a little boy, Christmas was my favorite day of the year where I would see people gathering and talking about things they did that year, not to mention the gifts I would receive. In Tim Burton's latest production, the film is about two worlds joining together in a wrecking mayhem.Jack the Pumpkin King is the leader of ""Halloween Town"" where every Halloween, his band of misfit monsters would go and scare all the children in the world; as much as he's fed up of scaring people, Jack wants to find out about the other traditions that people celebrate and finds out the Christmas is the one he likes as he sees the snow dropping from the sky, to a decorate Christmas tree with children playing inside houses, he wants to adopt the tradition into the Halloween world where everything is chaos as the little monsters kidnap Santa Claus and take him hostage where Jack takes the place of Santa putting monsters in stockings.

What can I say? Tim Burton has imagination,"""Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas"" is about the holiday worlds, in particular Halloween town which kinda links to the word 'nightmare' in the movie's title.

An amazing film!,"This is a visually stunning film. The stop-motion animation is so beautifully precise and detailed. I fell in love with ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" the first time I saw it. It is a masterpiece. The animation would be a waste if the story were poor. But not to fear...Burton provides such an original story of holidays having their own little towns with citizens working to stage our various holidays. This makes for a great storyline. The music is also stunning, with a beautiful vocal and instrumental score provided by the great Danny Elfman. I had the soundtrack within an hour of seeing the film for the first time. This movie was given special status due to it being the first feature length stop-motion animated film in history. However, the movie is so amazing that I think the special status would still have been given had ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" been the 17th feature length stop-motion animated film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
superb masterpiece!,"This film having been one of my childhood favorites, I decided to watch it again for the holidays.

The animation is fantastic, and combined with the cinematography, the visuals are stunning and undeniably memorable.

A darkly comic musical masterpiece,"A movie like no other you will ever see, and the undisputed pinnacle of stop-motion animation, The Nightmare Before Christmas is a work of genius. Directed by Harry Selick, it tells the story of the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, Jack Skellington.  Bored and disillusioned with an endless round of frights and tricks, he takes a late-night stroll through the world of holidays, and arrives in the morning in Christmas Town.  Amazed by the new splendour of this land, contrasting so sharply with his own, he hatches a plan to hijack Christmas and make his own version...Unsurprisingly, it was written by Tim Burton, the master of twisted comedy. The visuals are fantastic, and the dark humour which pervades the whole piece never misses a beat.  Danny Elfman provided a suitably dark, gothic score to complement the ghoulishly surreal imagery, so it succeeds as a musical, too, with enchanting tunes and bitingly clever lyrics.In short, a one-of-a-kind masterpiece. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Tim Burtons- The Nightmare Before Christmas,"I remember seeing this film for the first time, it is one of my earliest memories and the first film i can ever remember seeing, baring in mind i was only 1 year old when it came out, i also remember i couldn't stop crying when i watched it because i was so scared, lol. But that is in the past , and now i can truthfully say that this is my most favourite animated films ever, i think it beats ANY Walt Disney films. This film is just pure brilliance, the music score is superb and just fits so well with the story and animations, Tim Burton and Danny Elfman , are just the perfect duo.

A solid Xmas film,"Tim Burton showed that you don't have to be Pixar or use ""high-end"" technologies to produce original cartoon. In fact, this one beats most of the recent CG movies visually. Extremely well animated, very imaginative background design and songs. Lyrics are at times hilarious, and at the very least amusing.The film revolves around the concept of ""halloween"" guys trying to make Christmas with predictably failed results. I have to say that the plot itself is somewhat clichÃ©, but, probably, I've just seen too many of such movies. Execution is very nice, though, primarily due to an incredible amount of work that went into details. Another big minus is that it is too short by modern standards, a little over an hour. 8/10, with points deducted for length and plot.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
How can you say it is bad?,"This is a very good movie, I will agree with one of the people saying it's not the ""BEST MOVIE EVER MADE"" but I would have to say it is my favorite movie, the music is good (I know all the lyrics =P ) The animation is good for the date it was made, and frankely it is funny at some parts, such as ""There is only 365 more days until next Halloween"" - - ""364!!!""",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Highly Interesting,"Title says it all - this is one of those movies that makes you say, ""huh."" But, you like it. The worst thing I ever heard someone say is that it's okay. Understandable - the movie is animated, and a musical. If you don't like either, you won't like this film. But if you can appreciate good music and cool animation/effects, then you will find this movie likable. It's not overly predictable, but not, ""Oh my god! I had no IDEA he was going to do that!"" I don't want to give away a lot of the plot and highs of the movie, but I will say this - I recommend this to people above the age of 5 (they (people the age of 5 or below) might consider it to be scary). It's fun, has comedic moments (put it this way - when it's meant to be funny, it succeeds), although not intended really as a comedy, but more of an interesting watch that makes you wonder, ""What would I do if I were Jack Skellington?""",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Another Art-house that Tim Burton painted, metaphorically","Like Edward Scissorhands, this film is remarkable, and stunning because this adds that sort of jolliness into Halloween. Yeah, it had a controversial look to some Catholic church as it was being Satanist to the Lord, but they don't seek anything pass that, and it's not trying to say a nasty creed about anything. After all, the lesson is that you can't change something; otherwise it best to be alone. This displays a good message to children because it has that emotion to move people. This is something that the family may enjoy one night while getting the popcorn ready. The setting is so cool that Tim Burton makes the background as festive as possible. Disney movies aren't as bad as it seems. I would grade this movie a A- because it definitely shows a creativity that displays a message, and a symbolical meaning to the society. This is an art-house film because it's definitely a movie that could stand on it's own with a deep meaning. You may think that Disney movies are all too happy, then you're wrong, this movie is part of Disney, but it shows not all Disney movies are bubbly.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Other than the animation....,"nothing good can be said about this movie, the music sucked, and although i am not a fan of musicals, this has to be the worst musical of all time.

Just don't get the Christmas Feeling!,Not for me or my wife and 12 year old daughter. My Daughter's thoughts were that she expected so much more as it had been recommended and lauded by so many but was left disappointed as the premise was interesting but was ruined by an over abundance of singing. My own thoughts were that the whole Halloweeners trying to understand xmas became pretty repetitive and I lost my interest quite easily as it felt like the same stuff repeated for 73 minutes. It wasnt that Seems we might be being a little petty. But it just didn't feel like a Christmas movie and certainly didn't evoke the same nostalgic feelings that numerous other xmas movies do.

Weird and not very likable,"""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" has been called a Halloween classic by many respected reviewers, yet after seeing it in 3-D re-release, I don't see what is so special. The story is this; the king of Halloween Town, Jack Skellington, has become bored of the same old thing every year, so after wandering through a haunted wood he comes upon Christmas Town. There he discovers what he has been missing all along: warmth and joy. So Jack kidnaps Santa and tries to make Christmas happen himself. Here's the thing though, it's a kid's movie, so it was very boring for me, but if I was a little kid I would've been scared silly of this movie. The visuals are dark and quite Gothic, and the main character is a lanky skeleton with dark holes for eyes.I must say, even though the visuals are Gothic, they are stunning. The whole movie is done in claymation so what they did is amazing. The opening sequence ""It's Halloween"" is a great song to introduce the movie with great eye candy, but all that quickly gets tiresome as you start to realize how truly weird and twisted it all is. Even Santa and Christmas Town looks somewhat creepy with a Gothic touch, it's slightly depressing. All the songs are in minors and flats which sets the overall tone, and none of the songs, except the above mentioned, are any good. You're probably thinking, ""I'm a big Tim Burton fan though, so I'll like it!"" Wrong! I'm the biggest Tim Burton fan ever and I didn't like it. Plus, contrary to popular belief, this film is not directed by Burton, he only produced it, it was directed by veteran clay puppeteer Henry Selick. And the script was mediocre, not bad, but not particularly good either.The only other sequence I liked was the signature picture of Jack in front of the huge full moon. Otherwise, the 3-D was nothing special, though it does add some nice depth perception and makes you feel like you're watching it all in a box. The only reason I'd recommend this movie is if you already have seen it and loved it, or you like twisted, downright weird and boring movies.",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Tim Burton's Best,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time for many reasons. The movie is full of a special dark whimsy and the music is great. The animation is amazing and it is easy to forget that the characters, which have a wonderfully strange and unique design, are stop-motion animation (which really is a dying art form). The movie, which has often been linked with the Goth subculture, is by no means scary and (the non-3D version, although I have never seen the 3D one) will frighten only the most cowardly children or those that are going through a ""fear phase"". The movie focuses on Jack Skellington, the mind behind Halloween, who, after the annual celebration, becomes bored of the holiday and wants something new. After wandering in the forest, Jack stumbles upon Christmas and becomes infatuated with the holiday. He brings the holiday back to the Halloween-citizens, who do not fully understand the holiday, and Jack decides to take Santa Claus's place and chaos ensues. It is up to Sally the rag-doll, who loves him, to save Jack from making a big mistake. This movie has an entertaining plot and although it is only an hour long, the movie contains elements of a musical, a comedy, and a love story and is Tim Burton's best, only comparable to Edward Scissorhands.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Great For Halloween and Christmas,"The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Classic stop-motion animation from producer Tim Burton and director Henry Selick about Jack Skellington, the leader of a town devoted to Halloween, who grows tired of everything being the same so he decides to wonder out to a small town where he discovers then celebrating Christmas. Wanting to crash the party, Jack takes over the role of Santa Claus with his added bit of darkness. The stop-motion sub-genre has always been something that fascinated me just from a technical level. It's just amazing to me how much work has to be done in order to get any movie made but the stop-motion process just blows my mind because of everything that has to be done. THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas is without question one of the greatest looking films the genre has ever seen and no matter how many times I see it there's always something I see for the first time. The amount of details in every shot is just amazing to see and especially when you really look and notice how much is going on during every scene. I think the most impressive stuff is in Halloweentown because of all the detail and the terrific imagination going on. All of the characters, especially Jack and the mad doctor, are perfect but even the smaller ones just contain so much imagination that you can't help but get involved with what's going on. The music numbers are also extremely entertaining and quite clever in their lyrics. I think what really works so well is that most people feel Christmas or Halloween are the best holidays out there and this film really captures the spirit of both so well.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"Unless you hate animation, you'll love this film.","The Nightmare Before Christmas is charming, disturbing, enlightening and distributed by Disney.  Since the 1960s, rarely, if ever, would I have associated any of the first three descriptors with the company in question. It is a tribute to Tim Burton and Henry Selick that they could even attempt this feat, much less accomplish it.The story itself explores the notion of humanity's greediness in that the main character, Jack Skellington, the scariest (and therefore, worshiped) creature in Halloween Town, falls upon Christmas Town after finding himself unsatisfied by being the scariest once again: it's lonely at the top. After finding out that another holiday as different and exciting as Christmas exists, he attempts to make it his own by talking the inhabitants of Halloween Town into taking over Christmas for the year.  Jack wants what can never be his.The stop motion animation is awe-inspiring even to this day, seven years later.  It is clear that the movie was time consuming and a labor of love. In addition to the fact that it was visually stunning, the animation proved itself necessary as the plot unfolded for many different reasons.Danny Elfman performs at his usual virtuosic level as a composer and adds to it as the singing voice of Jack Skellington.  The music is ""catchy,"" complex and moving.  One can live vicariously in the Burton world upon listening to the soundtrack alone.The first time I saw the film, my initial thought (as an aspiring young music theatre actor) was that this would be a great Broadway show; however, I realized that the interpretation from stop motion animation to live action would have to lose something.Tim Burton fans have likely already seen this movie, however, many of us may have been put off by the fact that Michael Eisner footed the bill.  If you're a Tim Burton fan and you haven't seen this movie, do yourself the service of seeing it.  There are some familiar items in this movie  (i.e. the black and white color scheme from Beetlejuice and Sleepy Hollow, and the black and white striped worm from Beetlejuice) that  you'll enjoy seeing. You'll also just plain enjoy the movie.If you're a human being and you haven't seen this movie, do yourself the favor: see this movie.

i loved it,"The concept of the film alone is ingenious enough, but the presentation of it is beyond that. Tim Burton out did himself in his production of ""ANightmare Before Christmas. The acting in in this film is great and is only complimented by the vocal performances. The animation is revolutionary and flawless. you won't find a better example of puppetry and animation in Hollywood. The music is divine. not only are the vocal performances of this film wonderful, but the composition and overall flow and sound of the film's music and sound effects are what make this movie. The viewer is enticed into the story from the very beginning and their attention is held throughout the film. The imagery that the film contains is ironic and somewhat creepy which adds to the effect of the story and keeps the viewer entertained. If you are a fan of dark and captivating films ""A Nightmare Before Christmans"" is a must see. anyone who does not see this movie is missing one of Tim Burton's best films and definitely one of my personal favorite movies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Good, But Not a Classic","After another successful holiday, Halloweentown's discontented super-scarer Jack wanders aimlessly out of town and unwittingly happens upon a door to another village. This place, known as Christmastown, is much different than his own home and he begins to pine for something different. When he returns home, Jack starts his own Christmas that inevitably falls short, leading to an abduction of Santa Claus and some ensuing chicanery.Somehow I've never seen this twisted animated feature despite its stellar reputation. I've got a love/hate relationship with Tim Burton. Some of his stuff is incredible and some of it is terrible. ""Batman"" great, ""Planet of the Apes"" terrible. ""Alice in Wonderland"" solid, ""Beetle Juice"" not a fan. I guess that's the case with anybody but I feel like many directors are more predictable as to how I'm likely to feel about their films after seeing them. Still, Burton's style is entirely his own and he is a unique visionary, even if his visions are often creepy and weird. Burton didn't direct ""Nightmare"" but his finger prints are all over it. ""Nightmare"" is a solid outing but I'm not as into it as so many other people are. The visuals are excellent, the musical portions are great, and there's a definite entertainment value. But if I'm being honest, I was easily distracted from what was taking place on screen. Despite my ADD tendencies, a 76 minute animated movie shouldn't lose my attention (and interest?). I got bored between songs and drifted away to whatever was happening on Twitter and Facebook and that left me feeling just okay about ""Nightmare"" as a whole. Maybe my feelings would be different if I'd seen this in a theater or perhaps I'm not really the target audience. Either way, I'm not totally sold.Check out The Soap Box Office: www.thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Epic and wonderful holiday fun,My favorite movie if all time. Do not understand how anyone could give it less than a 10.,10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Oh the memories,This takes me back to my McDonald Rd days as a kid growing up. Mr Boogey was so ef'ing evil. Jack reminds me so much of myself and Barack Obama. He is the man with the master plan as we tend to say. Blessings in blessings - and commas on commas. One of the greatest hits of all time. Long live the scales.,10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Super impressive,"Sure it's a Tim Burton movie and it has some weird stuff, but I say the plot is pretty genius. The ""What's this?"" song is stuck in my head, and the stopmotion is incredible for 1993. This is one of those movies where you either love it or hate it, and I love it. A few scenes are dull, but everything else was really interesting. Definitely watch this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A Masterpiece Of Film,"Tim Burton's genius shows in every way with this fantastic film. The eerie yet fun loving mood he creates is wonderfully immersive, and is amazingly done. The stop motion animation for this movie is done so well, it flows just like CGI for the most part. The story, characters, and setting are all so real you feel like your there.Jack Skellington is a spooky, lovable guy. He travels to Christmas town and tries to bring Christmas to Halloween, without really knowing the meaning of Christmas, thus making a disturbing combination of the two. He gets into a mess with a bug filled villain, tries to be Santa, and does other things that are great for Christmas or Halloween.If you see one of Tim Burtons stop motion films, see this. It is a masterpiece of epic storytelling proportions.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

My favorite movie,"This is my favorite movie ever. Shortly; if you like animation/stop motion or musicals this movie could be one of your favorite one too.Story is about a man (skeleton Jack or Pumpkin King Jack) who is in their primes but get tired of doing same thing over and over again. One day he find out there is more than he knows (Christmas). With excitement of new thing he decide he could do it better and wants to celebrate Christmas himself. From now on you should watch the movie.Rather than the story, music is really great and if you are really in same situation in life (where you are tired of doing same thing) you could really relate with protagonist of the movie.Don't skip this just because this is animation. It has great story, great music and good production.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"To be honest, it's the songs that betray this movie.","I'm not sure where this film went wrong. Clearly, it's a labour of love, and clearly there's more going on in each scene than there is the entire screenplay of most films ever made. So why isn't it a classic? I think it's the songs. Irrelevant, tuneless, lumbering and uninspired, they dominate the film's events and detract attention from the otherwise astounding spectacle. Danny Elfman has done some fabulous stuff in his time: Edward Scissorhands, Batman etc. But when his songs were thrown into the spotlight as they were here, they sadly failed on so many levels.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
True to its title..a Nightmare,"Something nags at you watching this film. Like you've seen it before or at least in part. Then Jack, the main character, comes to Christmas Town and we see scene after scene so like Whoville in the Grinch. But before this we are subject to drab, ponderous singing and set designs. Nothing about the first 20 minutes makes you warm up to the story or any characters. But I mentioned the songs. Oh lord how awful. Who was targeted for this film ? Surely not children. My five year old grandson repeatedly asked to watch it and totally tuned out after 20 minutes. It was too late to miss the thoroughly obnoxious tune 'What's This ?' ..that mantra repeated ad nauseam as Jack sees a myriad of Christmas particulars he's not familiar with. It's a question you may ask after viewing, only in past tense 'What was that ?' !",2.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
This is Halloween,"This is Halloween. It's interesting to me to see what movies will become classics and what movies will be forgotten. This is definitely one of the classics. The animation is the proper balance of spooky and cute. The music sticks in your head, especially the song I referenced in the beginning of this review. The plot deals with Jack Skellington the king of Halloween Town and the fact that he is bored and suddenly decides to take over Christmas. The biggest question for me when thinking about this movie is, is this the best Halloween movie? Or is it the best Christmas movie? If you haven't seen it, I definitely recommend it. It might be a little scary for younger children, but for older children it's fine.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A fairy tale for adults. Amazing animation.,"From the very first moment this film had me spellbound and in stary-eyed amazement. I had never seen a film such as this, So fresh. So unique! Such extraordinary animation!! A dark fairytale... perhaps a little too dark for children... but for adults take a trip back to inside yourself and feel wonderment again, as I did. This film is a work of art. Great songs, too!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Love this flick!,"Mostly for the delicious score written (and mostly sung) by Danny Elfman. Cute enough for grown kids, but may be scary for some. ""Grups"" will appreciate the mixed traditions and great juxtapositions throughout. The vampires (like others) are both about 75% cute, 25% menacing. The role of the two-faced mayor is a cute archetype for all all political types. So many cute side characters flashing in and out it is wonderful. On repeated viewings, the opening number reveals more and more of the story. The animation in fantastic throughout. I wonder when someone will create a stage musical version. I (and many friends) would pay to see that. I think that (with creativity) it could be a fine stage play.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The best movie of all time,"I love this movie, to a point of obsession. I know all the songs and I'm constantly watching and re-watching the movie.

If you haven't seen this movie, WATCH IT. It is beyond all words.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Another Multi-Faceted Gem From the Burton/Elfman Team,"Supposedly a children's flick, but not really. It reminds me of ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" to a certain point, in that this is a movie made for adults with the ability to tap into the children they once were, rather than their inner children. There's a difference, you see. But rather than being slyly creepy, it's eerily beautiful. I've seen this movie several times, and like it a little more each time. The scene where Jack falls from Santa's sled and lands in the arms of a stone angel in a cemetery gets me every time I see it, as does the sad-romantic duet. When was the last time you were so moved by animated characters, not to mention clay-mation ones! Burton and Elfman make a great team. Beautiful, macabre, and delightful, it's like an animated adaptation of a childrens' poem, as written by Edgar Allen Poe.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Timeless,"Growing up watching The Nightmare Before Christmas, I may be a little biased, but even as I rewatch this film in my recent years, I can't deny the uniqueness it still upholds. Everything is almost perfection; the voice acting, the soundtrack, the animation, the plot, even the characters are lovable. I'm a sucker for a good Tim Burton film, and this is one of the best! I still put this movie in every year for Halloween and it never gets old. An enjoyment for all ages!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Mid-Range Fare,"I recall watching this back when it was first released and perhaps I was too cynical to appreciate the artistry behind it. I suppose at the time this was ground breaking imagery. And perhaps the years behind soften my take on it.I went to see the 30th Anniversary version this weekend, and I have to say...my initial reaction was correct.Though I am absolutely floored at the amount of dedication it takes to spend years on making a movie, the story itself left me flat.The story is of Jack Skellington, the rock star of Halloween Town, who seems to missing something in his life. A bigger purpose. He accidentally stumbles across Christmas Town and decides to kidnap Santa Clause in order to usurp his joy of giving.This turns into disaster, so he has to make right.That's it. There's not real conflict here. You expect a scientist who holds one of his creations hostage to be the guy. But even he's not that bad.This is a just a meandering film that has a impressive novelty.Newer viewers will not be THAT impressed.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Love ,Love, Love this movie!!",I absolutely adore this movie!!! This is the film that introduced me to the wonderful world of Tim Burton. This stands as one my favorite movies of all time. Tim Burton's artistic eye is absolutely amazing and he allowed the world to view one of the first stop motion animation masterpieces. Not to mention that Danny Elfman(as always)did an incredible job with the score. The characters are very dynamic for animated characters. You fall in love with the naive Jack and the rebellious Sally.I was scared to death of the oogie boogie man when I was a kid but never the less I would watch it and rewind it and watch it again until I fell asleep or had to go down for dinner.A film most definitely worth owning.Tim Burton is truly a master of stop motion animation on the big screen. One thing that confuses me though is I could never quite decide whether to put it in the Christmas category or the Halloween category. This is truly a film that everyone in the family can enjoy. I give it a 10 out of 10 because it has all the makings of an artistic animation genius.,10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Well, when one of the best writers/directors gets together with one of the best composers, and Disney, I don't think their are any bad things anyone can say.

Nearly Perfect,"""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" gets better every time you see it.

The songs by Danny Elfman seem so-so upon a first listen, but they get better on multiple viewings too.

Absolutely beautiful.,"When watching Burton films, you have to be really careful. Style over substance could be the best description of what to look out for; so much eye candy, so little plot.""Nightmare"" does not fall into this clichÃ©. This film is absolutely wonderful; the best ever to come out of Tim Burton's creative brain. It's a knockout.The story is truly an original one: what would happen if the Pumpkin King wanted to take over Christmas, too? Starting from there, all sorts of individual implications come out. Why did Jack want to do that? Why was he sad, lonely and depressed? How come the characters are so real that they are not good or bad, merely human, when they are made out of clay? What would the love of Sally be able to accomplish at the end? And how would the nightmare be finally solved?This film solves all this questions beautifully, in a stunning land, where human feelings abound. There is obsession, passion, love, loyalty, courage and humility to be found everywhere, all within the bodies of these wonderful puppets. That a film so artificial can be so profoundly human and moving is no small feat.This is one of my ""10"" movies. Simply perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

How can a nightmare be such fun?,"Tim Burton again. And at his best. Using stop motion for a musical/animation movie is the first of his witty and inspiring moves in this piece of art.

And Christmas isn't any better - it just...different.

Surprise people by doing your best in something you don't know anything about. Try new things. If you think you may enjoy something: DO IT.

one of the best films of Tim Burton,"Jack is the King of Hallowe'en and his work is to prepare all the frightening things to scare kids in Hallowe'en, but he is bored with his life, and, one day, he fonds the way to arrive to the Xmas city, where Saint Claus makes the same, but for Xmas. Astonished by the happiness environment, decides to kidnap Santa and make a Hallowe'en Xmas. A delicious animation musical, full of adventures, love and a refined Gothic black humour. It leaves us the idea that we have to find our place in the world and be happy with it, not trying to be what you are not. This is the main idea, but it is told to us in Burton's way, that is with a very dark humour and in a funny and scaring world. The job of doing it by stop-motion technique makes that the esthetic is unusually good and different to usual, which makes the story more touching; in addition to the enormous work that is working in this way. A fantastic film, recommended to every body (maybe kids could be a little scared)!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

What's This??,"This has always been one of my favorite Halloween movies.  Even if it isn't scary, the brilliant claymation and design of Halloween town is truly amazing.Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon/Danny Elfman) has grown tired of the same old scares and traditions of Halloween, yet feels as though no one in his kingdom of Halloweentown would understand.  One night while walking, he stumbles upon a collect of doors, each leading to a different world ruled by a certain holiday (a heart-shaped door for Valentine's Day, a shamrock for St. Patrick's Day, etc.).  However, he becomes completely mesmerized by the Christmas door and, upon discovering the world of Christmastown, finds what he believes he has been missing for so long.  However, no one in Halloweentown can truly understand Christmas.  Suddenly, Jack gets the idea of having his fellow goblins and monsters take over Christmas, and things go topsy-turvy really fast as children are given gifts of shrunken heads, vampire teddy-bears, man-eating snakes, the list goes on.  During all of this, the real Santa Claus (Ed Ivory) is held captive in Halloweentown by the Oogie Bogie Monster (Ken Page), who has plans to eat Santa before the night is up; and Sally (Catherine O'Hara), a living rag-doll who has fallen in love with Jack tries to save Christmas before it's too late.This truly goes as one of Tim Burton's masterpieces, not to mention a timeless classic that looks at both Christmas and Halloween from a totally different view.  The music is wonderful, with catchy songs like `What's This?' and `Kidnap Sandy Claws'.  Danny Elfman has always been one of my favorite composers, and the soundtrack to Nightmare Before Christmas is a true credit to his name.

Hence the word NIGHTMARE and the PG-13 rating. It is there for a reason. But this was a very fun movie, had a great soundtrack that I bought.

They should play this every year 'round Christmas time...,"...but, in fact, as far as I know, it's never been played on Dutch TV. Such a shame, as it is one of the best Christmas' movies of all time.Meet Jack Skellington, a (you guessed it) skeleton who lives in Halloween-town and makes kids scare on Halloween, year in year out. But Jack wants something more in life, and finds out about Christmas. Now that's a fun holiday! So he decides to kidnap Santa and take over his role. He does it with the best intentions (as far as kidnapping goes), but everything goes wrong... The kids aren't really happy with the presents (as they are more like scary monsters instead of Teddy bears) and Santa winds up in the hands of the evil Boogyman. Is there time to turn it all back?Tim Burton's characters and ideas are really amazing. Though a bit scary for the youngest, Halloween-town looks great. The story is really touching and the songs are some of the best the movies ever gave to us (Danny Elfman not only wrote the music, but sings on this one as well!). It's one of those movies you actually want to end well. Watch it and maybe you'll fall for it too...8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Maybe the Best Nightmare Ever,"Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas is for sure easy one the best stop motion movies ever: a wonderful dark and twisted world gets created before our eyes, the story is suspenseful and engaging, but for sure the visual quality of this gem is the most powerful part that makes this movie pure magic. The animation/special effects team made a fantastic job here. Anyway, if you like dark and grotesque movies you know this one already, I'm pretty sure, but if by whatever unfortunate reason or dark power you don't, put this one on your screen pronto. The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of those few movies, like The Corpse Bride, Coraline, The Dark Crystal or Labyrinth that are standing like titans between wannabes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A masterpiece of Danny Elfman and Tim Burton.,"The Nightmare before Christmas is a story about the world of hollidays. Especially that of Halloween and Christmas. ItÂ´s about how Jack Skellington, or the Pumpkin King, is restless and tired of scaring people. He finds a wonderful world with snow and a huge lobster-red man, that goes by the name of Sandy Claws.The story, by Tim Burton, is a little to predictable, but rather entertaining. The music by Danny Elfman is genious. The tone of the song is so capturing. ItÂ´s maybe a little too overwhelming, but then it also helps on the not-so genious history.Please donÂ´t burn me on the cross, papa!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
This movie was excellent,This movie is awesome! People may think that the graphics aren't that great but that's the exact way the creator of this movie wanted it to be. I absolutely love the theme of this movie because it has two of my favorite holidays in it Christmas and Halloween. It's absolutely amazing at all the things these monsters think of especially Jack Skellington he has some great ideas and he always gets into trouble he should listen to Sally more often. Sally is my favorite character because she is smarter than any of the monsters in Halloweentown and she makes better choices I would run away from that hideous professor too. This is a great movie if you haven't seen it you really should. The Nightmare before Christmas rocks!!,10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Phenomenal production, story and characters!","This movie had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish! Just sat there in AWE! I couldn't even eat my popcorn, as I might miss something. This movie has some of the most fabulous characters, artistry, storyline, soundtrack, and animation ever produced. It shouldn't be confused with normal animation at all, it is a far better production and filming technique. Most viewers will become totally entranced into believing that you are actually there participating along with the characters. The characters are astounding from conception to their manifestation. Their colors and shapes, from their original being to the multiple morphs that they might become, are without equal! I don't plan on reviewing the storyline, but these characters have stayed with me, permanently etched in my mind, ever since first seeing the film. I try to watch this movie every year at Halloween with friends, and am always as entertained as the first time! It is that great of a movie to be watched annually, like ""Its A Wonderful Life"", and someday could be considered as one of the best productions ever of it's genre. It is also a fabulous distractional movie for your kids; they will watch it over and over for weeks on end, enamored with each of the hundreds of characters, colors and songs. You cannot help but enjoy this movie, it has extravagant shapes, colors, backgrounds, characters, music, songs, themes and morals. A great story presented greatly. Just think, I still have this much passion about a movie that I first saw over 15 years ago! Enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Definition of a movie with soul: Henry SelickÂ´s nightmare before Christmas,"So itÂ´s December, itÂ´s Christmas season and I'll celebrate that by watching 24 Christmas movies, one every day until Christmas! Is it going to be good? Who knows, but this is Christmas 2022 day 1, and what a movie to start with.Look I know you want to poke holes in Henry SelickÂ´s nightmare before Christmas. Could it have been longer? Sure. Could the characters and the plot have been fleshed out? Absolutely. But in the end this is just an enjoyable time from start to finish. ItÂ´s tight, itÂ´s amazing looking and an amazing musical with amazing songs. I will forever treasure this movie and keep in mind how small the production team of this movie was. This is a gooddamn masterpiece of an indie movie.We follow Jack Skellington, the top person at Halloween town, a town where the holiday of Halloween resides. Jack is tired of doing the same thing over and over again and stumbles upon Christmas town, the town dedicated to the holiday of Christmas. Jack gets a new idea, to do Christmas this December.First of all, thank you Henry Selick for creating an amazing movie and keeping all of this production going and looking as amazing as could be. This is of course a huge celebration of the entire production crew, but Selick shows a keen eye for how everything should work out and look. Second thank you Danny Elfman for an incredible performance and making and incredible musical and an incredible score that sounds so wonderful. And lastly, thank you Caroline Thompson for writing a great story that is incredibly well told and so so fun. These three individuals deserve so much more praise than they ever get for this movie and I just wanted to really thank them.The voice performances are pretty cute and charming in this movie. All the singing too. Everyone plays their role pretty well and its so charming to hear everyone do their very unique voice. The stand outs to me are Danny Elfman as Jack Skellingtons sinning voice. He delivers so much character to the character making you understand exactly how he fells all the time. His singing is also so characteristic with ups and downs in tone and voice. My other stand out is Ken Page who plays Oogie Boogie. He is clearly having so much fun with the role and his performance is iconic. Like Elfman Page delivers this really characteristic voice performance that makes the character stand out.The stop motion at display is phenomenal. Every character moves so smooth and articulates so well. ItÂ´s a movie that still to this day looks unique and incredible. The amount of time this most have taken most have been insane to make all the characters look and act like they do. So many molds, faces sets, all done to absolute perfection and with so much flare, charm and soul put in it.Same with the overall production design. So many incredible and now iconic looking sets and shots. So many different characters, buildings, details colors, all coming together to create a masterclass in stop motion, animation in general, and pour filmmaking. This might be one of my favorite looking movies and one of my favorite projects to be put to screen. Its all just so charming and again, toy can feel the soul here.The songs of this movie are incredible. All memorable and serving the movie so well. Most of them are of course iconic today and are all performed so well. The score is also so beautiful and foretells what to come. Elfman really gave it his all here.The plot is really tight, and the movie utilizes all of its runtime so well. The movie fells like it have a natural flow to it that just works for me. ItÂ´s a great story about doing something you don't quite understand. ItÂ´s easy to translate to a lot of situations and the story told is great and teaches you well about the dangers, but also joys of doing something new without completely understanding all facets of it.I just love this movie. It brings a huge smile to my face every time I watch it. ItÂ´s one of the movies that just oozes soul and passion from start to finish and it can be seen through the entire movie. Songs, score, production of the entire world and characters, story, animation, all coming together to create an incredible and wonderful spectacle.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Magic,"One of Tim Burton's finest moments. The story is simply fantastic; unlike anything else. He _must_ have influenced the director also, as the feeling of the movie is to be compared to Tim's other goth-stylish pieces of work.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
By far the best movie ever made,"This was the best movie ever made. Jack Skellington, who is ""The King of Halloween"", ""The Pumpkin King"", or ""Bone Daddy"", gets tiresome of a life in Halloweentown, celebrating but one holiday every year and the same old, same old. Jack stumbles upon Christmastown and learns a lesson of who he is, and discovering himself. This movie is Romance, fiction, inspiration, action, adventure, and family all in one. I would give anything to be a resident of Halloweentown (or maybe just being able to meet Danny Elfman). =)I give it ONE HUNDRED out of ten. Sally (the rag doll) is secretly in love with Jack, but is not confident to tell him so. In the end, everything works out and Jack, Sally, and all the members of Halloweentown live....(well, you'll have to see the movie!)",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
One of Tim Burton's Best Films of all time,"I first saw this movie back 12 years ago on VHS at some daycare I use to go to.This movie is directed by the same guy who did Batman, Batman Returns, BeetleJuice, and Edward Scissorhands: Tim Burton.What's great about this movie is it's unlike any holiday movie, you'd ever see. Let's say the plot to it is similar to the Grinch only with more Gothic humor to it.It involves an intro to a place where holidays originated from. Each door leads to a certain holiday, this one focuses on Halloween and Christmas. The leader of Halloween Town is Jack Skellington aka Pumpkin King. He's the town hero/favorite. He does the honor of leading and making the Holiday as great as it could be.But he's been doing from year after year, that he's tired of doing the same old thing. So he walks through the woods till he approaches several Holiday doors. He ponders and wonder what they lead to, but not sure which one to check out. Till he spots the XMas door which caught his attention and is willing to see what's in it.He goes in and before he knows it, he's in a different land which amazed him and wants to know what it is by examining the way it's celebrated and done, but ends up stealing it for himself and Halloween Town to create their own XMas.This is a one of kind film to see. It's all done with Stop Motion animation. Story written by filmmaker Tim Burton. Contains numerous and memorable characters and songs to admire.Made a lot of merchandise out of it too. It's worth seeing if you like Stop Motion animation or like Gothic movies Tim Burton does.It's a real treat to see.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
10/10 masterpiece,"Best film ever made, a true masterpiece of pure orgasmic euphoria and a genuinely impactful plot that blows nearly everything else ever made out of the water with its genius in every department. Such is this film, I don't even know if it is more art then movie its so amazing. I can't stress enough just how perfect in every way this magnum opus is and thus have made a regular habit of watching it and let me tell you it never gets old, this is a timeless classic up there in artistic genius as the Mona Lisa and having the best musical production in the world by far, well exiting all music new and old so in conclusion this is a true must watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Best Musical Ever!!!,"I never liked musicals. They were always stupid love stories with silly characters who started singing in the middle of the road... This one is really different.For once the characters are puppets which makes it easy to watch them sing and dance for no apparent reasons. Then there is the music. Danny Elfman has come up with the best original soundtrack for a musical ever. I am no stranger to other famous musicals like My Fair Lady and such, but the best versions of these soundtracks were always made by third parties, usually jazz musicians. Take for instance the version of ""On The Street Where he Lives"" by Peggy Lee. Much better than the original. Also, the voices are superbly cast. Even if they are by no means what we usually consider beautiful voices, they fit the characters and the feeling the actors put to the wonderfully written words is astounding. The movie itself is gorgeous, in a dark, funny kind of way. Tim Burton has outdone himself. The story is imaginative, original and has something to do with an original subject and not the usual, boring, silly, overused, tiresome, and artificial Hollywood-made version of love.Those of you who are really incapable of loving this movie deserve my pitty and sympathy. It must be really sad to live in a world with no fantasy.As for all the others who haven't seen it. For your own sakes and mental growth, see it!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

A Halloween Christmas Mashup Extravaganza,"A nice fusion of Christmas and Halloween, The Nightmare Before Christmas breathes life into the holiday mashup genre. If you don't like musicals you will hate this film but even I, who is not a big fan of English language musicals (because the songs are usually bad), found this film to be great. The stop motion animation was the best part about this film; the world we get transported to is one that is intriguing, dark and grueling. This will definitely scare your kid if they watch it when they're 5 or 6 but if they're 8 years old they've seen enough so that this film will be just fine to introduce them to the wonders of Christmas. There was one bad song in this film with the three delinquents singing it. Overall the musical aspect takes it down a notch but it's still a very entertaining animated kid's film to see during Christmas.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The nightmare before Christmas,"This is certainly a pleasant surprise. Tim Burton, purveyor of the wacko, has created, along with his amazing team, a real classic work. Seldom does a film bank on so much originality, from the incredible creation of Halloween Town, with its denizens, marvelous in their diversity and variety, to a really interesting plot. The Nightmare Before Christmas is a stop-motion classic that masterfully blends Halloween and Christmas themes. With memorable characters, catchy songs, and stunning visuals, it's a timeless tale of self-discovery and the importance of tradition. I hope you will find time to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Elfman at His finest,"I have been a huge fan of this movie since it was first released.  For the first bunch of years, I primarily enjoyed it for the animation and story. However, in the last couple of years, I find myself coming back to it for Danny Elfman's music and lyrics.If you've never noticed how certain exceptional composer weave character themes throughout a movie, you could do worse than to start your study of music in cinema with this film.  Witness how variations on Sally's theme accompany her throughout the film - or how strains of Jack's early lament repeat in several of his songs and appearances.Katherine O'Hara, who did such a nice job singing in the 2003's ""A Mighty Wind,"" is really an outstanding vocalist.  Here, she sings for both Sally and Shock and is quite excellent as both.  Elfman sings most of Jack Skellington's songs, as any fan of his early band Oingo Boingo will notice.Anyhow, the movie is a delight, the soundtrack even more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Rare Artistry,"Nightmare Before Christmas was a ground-breaking movie for what it did in the way of animation, and for the bizarre plot line that had never been done before, nor will probably ever be done again.  After all, who would have thought such a thing as a skeleton taking over Christmas?I don't think a lot of people `got it'.  It is difficult for some to just sit back and appreciate something for it's artistic value alone.  So many look to be spoon fed 100% excitement during the entire hour an a half of any film before they like it.In my humble opinion, almost ten years later the film holds up.  I believe that its value is in the creativity of both the screenplay and the musical score.  This is true art.  Tim Burton and Danny Elfman were able to put something very rare together with this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Where Would 'Hot Topic' Be Without This?,"There is a lot of irony to this film. First, Disney was not confident in this film's success, so they released under their ""Touchstone"" brand. The film then went on to be a big hit. The film would be right at home with the Disney Renaissance of animation. Second, it is often referred to as a Tim Burton film, despite not being written nor directed by him. It is just based off of a poem that he wrote. But this film embodies Tim Burton's style so much, it is synonymous with his M. O. Third, before this film stop motion was most often connected with Christmas specials. Stuff like ""Rudolph"" and other Rankin/Bass shorts. But after this film, stop motion was used far more for creepy Halloween stuff. Films like ""Wendell and Wild"" or anything done by Liaka Studios. It is often debated whether this counts as a ""Halloween"" or ""Christmas"" movie and itself represents the transition of medium's reputation.OK, enough of the strange place this movie finds itself, how is the movie? It is really, really good.There is a lot of music in this, more than the typical Disney film of the time, 11 in total. And at least 10 of those 11 are great memorable songs, Danny Elfman shines in this film.The animation is a huge step forward in stop motion. It is the first one where you can see more of the motion and less of the stop.The character of Jack Skellington is a ton of fun. Despite being in a world that should be full of darkness and gloom, he is relentlessly upbeat and optimistic. When he sees Christmas, he wants to share it with everyone. He may be misguided, but you feel his good intentions.On the negative side, being based on a short poem, there isn't quite enough here to last the 1hr 16 mins. The plot points of Mr. Boogey and Sally's visions feel tacked on to pad the runtime. But there are some enjoyable scenes that come from it.In the end, this is both a sweet treat in my Trick or Treat bag and a nice present in my stocking.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
