There appears a gorgeous singer , Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) , who is object of pursuit by the musicians (Jack Lemmon , Tony Curtis) who cannot reveal their identity because are dressed as women in order to getaway from killer gangsters' retaliation .Rightly enjoyable and fun-filled , milestone comedy which neatly combines humor , mirth , entertaining situations and amusement . This noisy comedy is intelligently and pleasingly written to gives us lots of fun , laughters and smiles . Mordantly funny , though by time of premiere was rated as bad taste and some discomfort ; however , is todays considered a real classic movie . Billy Wilder kept the studio Paramount happy , the picture consistently made money and was hit at box office . Flawless comedy with a trio of sensational protagonists , including an unforgettable Marilyn who parades sexily at her best and more relaxed and enticing than ever . The hit of the show is undoubtedly for the fetching Marilyn Monroe who gives one of the best screen acting and sings marvelous songs as ¨Running wild¨, ¨I'm through with love¨ and the immortal ¨I wanna be loved you¨. Magnificent performances from Jack Lemmon as angst-ridden musician dressed in drag and sensational Tony Curtis as a philander young , playing his Gary Gray Grant impression . Furthermore , a splendid secondary cast , a variety of notorious actors who make sympathetic interpretations such as Pat O'Brien , George Raft , Mike Mazurski , Nehemia Persoff and , of course, smitten Joe E Brown , including his now-classic closing line .The motion picture was very well directed by Billy Wilder who includes several punchlines . Billy was one of the best directors of history .

Later on , Billy collaborated with another excellent screenwriter IAL Diamond . Both of them won an Academy Award for ¨Stalag 17¨ dealing with a POW camp starred by William Holden . After that , they wrote/produced/directed such classics as ¨Ace in the hole¨ , the touching romantic comedy ¨Sabrina¨ , the Hickcoktian courtroom puzzle game ¨Witness for the prosecution¨ and two movies with the great star Marilyn Monroe , the warmth ¨Seven year itch¨ and this ¨Some like hot¨. All of them include screenplays that sizzle with wit . But their biggest success and highpoint resulted to be the sour and fun ¨¨The apartment¨. Subsequently in the 60s and 70s , the duo fell headlong into the pit , they realized nice though unsuccessful movies as ¨Buddy buddy¨ ,¨Fedora¨ , ¨Front page¨ and ¨Secret life of Sherlock Holmes¨, though the agreeable ¨Avanti¨ slowed the decline . The team had almost disappeared beneath a wave of bad reviews and failures . ¨Some like hot¨ rating : Above average , essential and indispensable watching ; extremely funny and riveting film and completely entertaining . It justly deserves its place among the best comedy ever made . One of the very funniest films of all time and to see and see again . It's the kind of movie where you know what's coming but , because the treatment , enjoy it all the same .",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Marilyn Monroe. Enough said.,"""Movies should be like amusement parks"" filmmaker Billy Wilder once said ""People should go to them to have fun"". So If Some Like It Hot was an amusement park: it would Thorpe Park, mixed in with Legoland, added with a dash of Disney land. Some Like It Hot is the granddaddy of comedies, the Godfather of laughs and the Mike Tyson of punch lines. Heck! Watching this film is like getting into the ring with Muhammad Ali, as you're constantly hit with fast paced gags. Even when you're least expecting it you're hit with a punch line so funny it leaves your side aching, or a piece of slapstick comedy that leaves your eyes running. Even the fade out line has been regarded as the funniest and most famous in history. Once you hear it, you'll guarantee never ever, ever to forget it. Trust me, it's hilarious!After playing witness to a routine gangland shooting, two penniless Chicago musicians, Joe and jerry decide it is the perfect opportunity, to remain safe and get paid a easy buck when they decide to take up residence in an all girl band heading to Florida, crossed-dressed as Josephine (Tony Curtis) and Daphne (Jack Lemmon). But with the only simple aim of getting paid and avoiding the mob, things soon get a little more tricky when a ditsy singer named Sugar (Marilyn Monroe) captures the heart of' Josephine' and a eccentric playboy millionaire falls for 'Daphne'.Some Like It Hot is one of those rare occasions, where everyone involved is at the very peak of their powers. Billy Wilder's directing is subtle but instrumental in loading every scene with comedic material ready to pop out like a wound up jack in the box. The writing is excellent, it constantly moves at a furious pace. Imagine Usain bolt on roller blades with jet pack attached to his back, and still that's not even as fast as how the dialogue rips through every scene. People may say that the comedy is too high concept, but for me that's the very reason it's so damn funny , as well a begin genius, because it means that the jokes will stand the test of time and span all generations because it's so easy to understand. Anyway who likes having jokes explained to them? No one!But you can't talk about Some Like It Hot, without mentioning Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, who were absolutely perfect for their roles, each adding a feeling of assuredness to theirs, as well as bucket full's of originality with every facial expression as well as every line. Initially I was not convinced by Marilyn Monroe, as I felt she was slightly overrated, but in her role as Sugar, she brings a lot of composure to the role adding balance to the high energy of Tony and Jack, but still getting her laughs not through straight jokes but by simply being able to deliverer every air headed line with great delivery and timing. Whilst still being able to remain sweet, helpless and innocent, even as she plunges picks into a solid cube of ice with great fury, as she talks about her weakness for Saxophone players.Some Like It Hot it like a magician of comedy, you never know what to expect next, as with every new scene you so excitedly anticipate what piece of comedic magic it will pull out of its sleeve. For me Some Like It Hot is the funniest comedy film I have ever seen, even though it is almost 55 years old, its comedy is still so accessible and funny too!",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
One of the Best Comedies of the Cinema History,"In 1929, in Chicago, the musicians and friends Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) flees from the night-club where they are playing during a police raid. Without any money, they seek a job position for saxophone and bass players in another band and they are invited to play in a concert for one night only in a distant town. Joe borrows the car of a former girlfriend to travel and when they arrive in the parking garage, they witness the ""Saint Valentine's Day Massacre"" led by the infamous mobster Spats Columbo (George Raft). The criminals discover Joe and Jerry hidden in a corner and when the killers are ready to execute them, they succeed to escape. Joe and Jerry disguise, dressing like women and they head to Florida by train with an all-girl band using the names of Josephine and Daphne. They get close to singer Sugar Kane Kowalczyk (Marilyn Monroe) and Joe falls in love with her but she believes he is a woman. Meanwhile the millionaire Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown) harasses Daphne inviting her to visit his yacht. When Spats and his henchmen arrive in the same hotel where Joe and Jerry are lodged for a mafia convention, the two musicians feel that they are in a dangerous situation.Yesterday Tony Curtis died and I decided to watch ""Some Like it Hot"" again. This film is another masterpiece of Billy Wilder and certainly one of the best comedies of the cinema history. Jack Lemmon is hilarious and responsible for some of the funniest moments especially when Osgood flirts with Daphne. Marilyn Monroe performs the perfect dumb blonde stereotype. Last time I had seen this movie was on 18 August 2000. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Quanto Mais Quente Melhor"" (""The Hotter, the Better"")",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Billy Wilder's screwball masterpiece with Curtis, Lemmon and the immortal Marilyn handed the best comedy roles of their careers.","Admittedly biased, ""Some Like It Hot"" can certainly stand on its own merit with or without my thunderous round of applause.  More than a decade ago, I had the privilege of performing both the Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon roles in ""Sugar,"" the musical adaptation of ""Some Like It Hot"" which originally starred Tony Roberts, Robert Morse and Elaine Joyce on Broadway in the 70s. Though it hardly compares to the film's original (how could it???), the musical nevertheless is still a big hit with live audiences.  I can't remember ever having a better time on stage than I did with ""Sugar,"" and it's all due to the irrepressible talents that instigated it all.In the 1959 classic, Curtis and Lemmon play two ragtag musicians scraping to make ends meet in Prohibition-era Chicago during the dead of winter who accidentally eyewitness a major gangland rubout (aka the St. Valentine's Day Massacre).  Barely escaping with their lives (their instruments aren't quite as lucky), our panicky twosome is forced to take it on the lam.  Scared out of their shoes (sorry), the boys don heels and dresses after they connect with an all-girl orchestra tour headed for sunny Florida.  Killing two birds with one stone, they figure why not go south for the winter while dodging the mob?  Once they hit the coast, they'll ditch both the band and their humiliating outfits.Enter a major detour in the form of  luscious Marilyn Monroe as Sugar Kane, given one of the sexiest (yet innocent) entrances ever afforded a star. Snugly fit in flashy 'Jazz Age' threads, a blast from the locomotive's engine taunts her incredible hour-glass figure as she rushes to catch her train to Florida.  The boys, stopped dead in their high-heeled tracks by this gorgeous vision, decide maybe the gig might not be so bad after all. As the totally unreliable but engagingly free-spirited vocalist/ukelele player for the band, Sugar gets instantly chummy with the ""girls"" when they cover for her after getting caught with a flask of booze.  As things progress, complications naturally set in - playboy Curtis falls for Monroe but has his ""Josephine"" guise to contend with, while Lemmon's ""Daphne"" has to deal with the persistently amorous attentions of a handsy older millionaire.What results is an uproarious Marx Brothers-like farce with mistaken identities, burlesque-styled antics, and a madcap chase finale, all under the exact supervision of director Billy Wilder, who also co-wrote the script.  Lemmon and Curtis pull off the silly shenanigans with customary flair and are such a great team, you almost wish THEY ended up together! Curtis does a dead-on Cary Grant imitation while posing as a Shell Oil millionaire to impress Marilyn; Lemmon induces campy hilarity in his scenes with lecherous Joe E. Brown (who also gets to deliver the film's blue-ribbon closing line).  As for the immortal Monroe, she is at her zenith here as the bubbly, vacuous, zowie-looking flapper looking for love in all the wrong places.  Despite her gold-digging instincts, Monroe's Sugar is cozy, vulnerable and altogether loveable, getting a lot of mileage too out of her solo singing spots, which include the kinetic ""Running Wild,"" the torchy ""I'm Through With Love,"" and her classic ""boop-boop-a-doop"" signature song, ""I Wanna Be Loved by You.""The film is dotted with fun, atmospheric characters.   Pat O'Brien and George Raft both get to spoof their Warner Bros. stereotypes as cop vs. gangster, Joan Shawlee shows off a bit of her stinger as the by-the-rules bandleader Sweet Sue, Mike Mazurki overplays delightfully the archetypal dim-bulbed henchman, and, if I'm not mistaken, I think that's young Billy Gray of ""Father Knows Best"" fame (the role is not listed in the credits) playing a snappy, pint-sized bellhop who comes on strong with the ""girls.""For those headscratchers who can't figure out why the so-called ""mild"" humor of ""Some Like It Hot"" is considered such a classic today, I can only presume that they have been brought up on, or excessively numbed by, the graphic, mindless toilet humor of present-day ""comedies.""  There was a time when going for a laugh had subtlety and purity - it relied on wit, timing, inventiveness and suggestion - not shock or gross-out value.  It's the difference between Sid Caesar and Andrew ""Dice"" Clay; between Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon and Chris Farley and David Spade; between ""I Love Lucy"" and ""Married With Children""; between Lemmon's novel use of maracas in the hilarious ""engagement"" sequence, and Cameron Diaz's use of hair gel in a scene that ANYBODY could have made funny.  Jack Lemmon could do more with a pair of maracas than most actors today could do with a whole roomful of props.  While ""Some Like It Hot"" bristles with clever sexual innuendo, today's ""insult"" comedies are inundated with in-your-face sexual assault which, after awhile, gets quite tiresome -- lacking any kind of finesse and leaving absolutely nothing to the imagination.  I still have hope...Having ultimate faith in my fellow film devotees, THAT is why ""Some Like It Hot"" will (and should be) considered one of THE screwball classics of all time, and why most of today's attempts will (and should be) yesterday's news.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
The Perfect Comedy,"Why a man would want to marry another man? asks Tony Curtis, Security! Jack Lemmon replays without missing a beat. Clearly he had put the question to himself before and had arrived to a perfectly sensible conclusion. Everything in this gem of a movie had been thought so cleverly and as it turned out so prophetically, that the world of our three characters, a world of prohibition and gang wars could be today and more than likely will be tomorrow. Billy Wilder analyzes human nature with an acid eye and a glorious panache for underlining our most endearing features. Our frailties. Marilyn Monroes is at her pick, the sadness in her eyes a startling metaphor in a comedy about wanting. Tony Curtis with an Eve Arden's pout is so beautiful, so charming, imitating Cary Grant and trying to be himself that, in my mind he'll be always be in a frock. And, of course, Jack Lemmon, throwing himself into the part, body and should. Only perfection can allow to end its course with a line like ""Nobody's perfect""",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A Legendary Comedy,"With Billy Wilder's steady direction, the great casting, and Wilder/Diamond's sparkling script Some Like It Hot has become one of the most enjoyed comedies of cinema history. The story itself is pure comedy gold; the unhappy jazz-musicians Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) are witness to the St. Valentine massacre in 1929 and flees from Chicago with an all-girl-band who's headed for Miami, dressed up as ""Josephine"" and ""Daphne"". Soon both are hooked on Sugar Kane (Marylin Monroe), the band's lead singer - but things gets more complicated when arrived in Miami, Daphne attracts a elderly playboy and the gangster of Chicago arrives at the Floria-hotel to have a mafia-meeting.The work of the three participants in center is truly great; Marylin Monroe is at her most sexy and charming, Tony Curtis' brilliant control and Jack Lemmon is truly priceless at his peak. The movie paces fantastically throughout opening scenes of Chicago, onto the train-ride (features fantastically funny moments of brilliant comedy timing) and arriving at the hotel in Florida, and the situations that occurs with the band, with playboy Osgood Fielding III, Marylin Monroe and the mafia. And Billy Wilder shows his talent with keeping such a sparkling screenplay brilliantly paced and edited, never rushing itself - and Wilder sneaks in some fine moments of noir with the Chicago-gangsters brutality and cruelness. And the movie is a altogether different experience as a comedy than anything before it, the absurdity and quirkiness of Curtis and Lemmon in a transvestite-comedy is fantastically funny, and the final dialog between Osgood Fielding and Daphne/Jerry seemingly came out of the blue, and surprised me just as much today as it did back in 1959. Some Like It Hot is nothing less than a must-see in comedy, and cinema history.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Some Like It Hot - The Classical Comedy,"There is always a thing about Classics, even before you absorb the first frame; you are burdened with huge expectations. But, Some Like It Hot is one of those jet planes where you got to tight your seat belt and forget everything else to enjoy the joyride or you would fall off your seat.I feel casting in a movie is one of the most under discussed elements of movie making amongst general public but it plays a very significant role in the success of a movie and SLIH is the prime example of it. Apart from Jack Lemmon, none of the protagonists were known for their superior acting skills and they would not have made the cut for a Billy Wilder piece. But, in retrospect, who other than Tony Curtis who had a boyish look and at the same time possessed sharp features could have played a saxophone playing woman charmer who could cross dress to be a part of a woman band. You can only get a flawless performance from a bad actor only if he/she is playing himself/herself and that is the exact reason why Marilyn Monroe wows you in every scene of Some Like It Hot. She is playing a dumb, vivacious and vulnerable damsel who can sing, doesn't mind sleeping with a charming guy whenever she gets a chance and then dips herself in a whiskey bottle when left all alone with herself. Jack Lemmon with a broad muscular jawline was surely the one who had a better chance of getting caught as someone not in the right clothes, but that is very small price to pay, as an actor of his caliber was indispensable to the cause of SLIH. He has an amazing sense of timing when it comes to humor; he is almost chaplinesque when it comes to expressions and the confidence with which he delivers his lines puts him right at the top of stack.I am not sure when was the concept of black humor introduced in the world of cinema, but, SLIH has to be one of the better examples from the old times where black humor is integrated in the comedy. The black humor is there only to make its presence felt and nothing more. Other than that SLIH is a fun filled journey of Gerald (Lemmon) and Joseph (Curtis), two musicians on the run from dangerous Chicago gangsters who are after their lives. They find their safe house in an all-woman band that is off to Florida for a string of performances. This is where they meet the gorgeous Sugar (Marilyn) and try their luck on flattering her. It is all about how Joseph manages to get ahead in the race and Gerald like a true friend tags along without any explaining or pleading by Joseph. This is what makes SLIH sweet. The necessary salt is added to the movie by little moments like women having a party on train, Sugar hiding whiskey in her stocking, Fielding (Joe Brown) hitting on Dalphe (Gerald disguised as a woman) and further complications that set in because of these. What makes this classical comedy special is the fact that it makes you laugh at so many occasions without being slapstick or cheap or using the chaos technique. And when it doesn't make you laugh, it makes you smile. Most importantly, the movie stays with you.The manner in which the movie begins, it suddenly makes you wonder - that's too much of real car chasing and shooting for a black and white movie of 40's and then you realize it's done in 1959 and the movie was intentionally produced in black and white. The first scene itself is a cracker and will create a cocktail of emotions, with words like liquor, crime, party, death, music all floating around at the same time. There are plenty of scenes where the camera pans out from one object to another capturing multiple things with different moods and complexion in the same scene and that is a technique which I guess wasn't used quite frequently back then. Make-up job of Curtis and Lemmon is too good for those times and it would have been so important for that to have been correctly done as that is absolutely central to the whole plot. Marilyn's costumes are way modern and she carries them effortlessly.Some Like It Hot is without any doubt a classic but, probably in no other movie would have the last line played such an important role as in this. The finishing frames where Joe Brown utters the unexpected leave you pleasantly surprised and I am sure it would have had far better impact on the audience 50 years back.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
What's Not To Like?,"Some people still say this is the greatest comedy ever made in Hollywood. Who am I to argue? Even after 45 years, it's still very funny and not the least bit dated. It is one of the true classics in the history of film.I know one thing: Marilyn Monroe never looked hotter!The film is a wonderful combination of comedy, action, suspense and romance with great old-time gangster scenes played out first in Chicago and then in Miami Beach. George Raft and Nehimiah Persoff are just great as gangsters.The stars, though, are Monroe, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis but you can also enjoy performances from famous known actors like Pat O'Brien and Joe E. Brown.The action scenes are in the beginning and end. In the middle, the bulk of the film, is the main story featuring comedy and romance. Lemmon has the best lines in the film and his facial expressions alone evoke lots of laughter.This film is so famous that there is no need going into detail, but for some younger person reading this, don't worry about this being an old-fashioned, boring black-and-white film your parents or grandparents liked but you would find boring. You'll have fun watching this, too, I guarantee it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A gender-bending comedy ahead of its time,"What Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis do in ""Some Like it Hot"" would be par for the course in modern movies  every other month, similar fish-out-of-water movies premiere with men posing as women (""Tootsie""), women posing as men (""The Associate""), black people posing as white people (""White Chicks""), and on and on. What makes ""Some Like it Hot"" different is two things: the strength of its comedy, and the presence of Marilyn Monroe, then at the height of stardom.Lemmon and Curtis turn in admirable performances both as Joe and Jerry, and as Josephine and Daphne. Tony Curtis does Lemmon one better by creating a third identity, ""Junior"", in order to woo Sugar Kane (Monroe).Tying the pair's story into the Chicago Valentine's Day Massacre, where a gang war spilled over into a parking garage, leaving a number of people lined up against the wall and shot, is a deft touch (though the serious tone of these gang sequences contrasts sharply with the bulk of the movie).The movie does an excellent job building the far-fetched stakes of the movie ever-higher, from their finding refuge from vengeful gangs in a women's jazz band, to their showdown in the Florida hotel, to the eventual revealing of Curtis' and Lemmon's identities. The movie's surprisingly suggestive and risque content is at odds with the time frame of the movie, and even with the period of the movie's creation. The many smart double-entendres and plays on words are very well-written, and alternate between lowbrow and highbrow comedy,The films only fault might be a couple of overlong musical numbers, performed either by the whole band or soloed by Sugar Kane. Though to be expected in a Marilyn Monroe film, these musical acts are literal ""show stoppers"" that bring the comedic momentum of the film to a screeching halt. However, it is easy to over look these minor defects in the movie as a whole, because by and large it is quite funny  no wonder it s considered a classic  and after all, ""nobody's perfect"".",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
It's pretty hot.,"It's a classic comedy starring Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon as two musicians who witness a mob hit and, to protect their identities, disguise themselves as female musicians and flee the state with a female band disguised, only to find themselves being chased by men and the mob.Curtis and Lemmon are like a mismatched couple, bickering and becoming frustrated with one another as they go through their misadventures on the road. It serves up some chuckles and humor and helps with the film's steady-moving plot. Marilyn Monroe as female lead Sugar Kane is surely the highlight of the movie and did what I think is one of her most iconic roles, bubbly, innocent-acting and vulnerable in her acting and singing two show-stopping songs. Her spellbinding beauty is sure to charm anyone and she had some good chemistry with Curtis.However, the film does suffer a little from Curtis and Lemmon's at times overzealous acting and the lack of suspense from the pursing-mob subplot. Overall, though, it's not a bad film and is good for some laughs.Grade B-",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
The funniest movie ever made?,"One of the all time great screen comedies, Some Like It Hot stars Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis, and Jack Lemmon at their best. Billy Wilder, one of the all time great directors, co-wrote and directed this fantastic movie.Set in 1929, Lemmon and Curtis are out of work musicians who witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. Fleeing for their lives, they disguise themselves as female musicians in order to get to Florida and away from the mob. This is where the fun begins.Renamed ""Daphne"" and ""Josephine"" they try their best to keep their secret. But when ""Josephine""(Curtis) meets sexy ukulele player Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) you know he's going to blow his cover somehow. While Curtis tries to woo Monroe by pretending to be her dream man as she has told him, Lemmon is courted by Osgood Fielding (Joe E. Brown). Curtis adapts a Cary Grant accent and pretends to be frigid in the movie's funniest scenes. Lemmon seems to forget he's a boy and has so much fun with Fielding and adores the things he buys him. Between the cases of mistaken and pretend identities, the mobsters come to Florida for their Opera Lovers Meeting. It all winds up with a hilarious ending.This movie is a gem from start to finish. Curtis, Monroe, and Brown are great in their parts. Monroe brings a funny and sexy vulnerability to Sugar and Curtis is great with his performance as ""Josephine"" and the stuffy millionaire who talks just like Cary Grant. Lemmon really steals the movie here. He invests Daphne with such enthusiasm that we can understand why he's falling for Osgood. He's having way too much fun and it's great to watch him. This is a true classic from start to finish. It's recommended for anyone who likes to laugh.Grade:A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Monroe should receive credit for coming across as highly relatable and someone easy to root for,"Some Like it Hot (1959) is a movie I recently watched on Amazon Prime. The storyline involves two traveling band members that are being hunted down after witnessing a murder by a gang. The band members decide to dress as girls and join a traveling female band. Their new bandmember is a knockout that is going to make hiding their identity a challenge. This movie is directed by Billy Wilder (Sabrina) and stars Marilyn Monroe (Gentlemen Prefer Blonds), Tony Curtis (Spartacus), Jack Lemmon (Grumpy Old Men) and Pat O'Brien (Angels with Dirty Faces). The storyline for this is super cheesy but has some rollercoaster twists and turns as Lemmon and Curtis hide their identity. Monroe should receive credit for coming across as highly relatable and someone easy to root for. The scenarios are ridiculous but entertaining and it is fun to watch this movie unfold.

I think its over rated.,"I think this movie is a great example of the double standard used to rate movies. Its obviously got a great cast, and has its moments, but there's no way I see this as the ""number 1 comedy of all time"" or ""the #11 movie"" as shown in IMDb.I think (and this is really true with some foreign films) that sometimes the director's reputation or the prior history of some of the stars, creates a bias. And once a movie gets over rated, its nearly impossible for the collective public to reverse that impression.I think that ""old boy"" system works both ways....under valuing some films by new directors, as well as grossly over rating films by old timers.Back to this movie specifically....there are holes in the plot you could drive a truck through, and many of ""the gags"" are worth a smile at best. Not a single belly laugh in the entire movie.But then, according to our ratings, the only comedy rated above Some like it hot, in the last 45 years, was the movie Jim Carrey made in 2004, that was in and out of the theaters in 15 minutes. (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind).Personally I laughed my butt off in Airplane the first time I saw it, and every time I see ""Trains, planes and automobiles,"" and neither of those are even in the top 50, comedy wise.Often I think, that despite 45 years of studying cinema, including university level courses in cinema theory/appreciation, that there's just more to their evaluation then I understand.Watch it....but keep the expectations to a minimum and you might just enjoy it.",5.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

This is the exception.Every time I watch this film, I notice something else that makes me laugh - I cannot think of a weak performance or a dodgy line.I love the fact that George Raft gives the impression that he was not told that it was a comedy and plays the chief mobster completely straight. Contrasting this with the silliness of some of his underlings is priceless stuff, though rarely slapstick (homage to Cagney aside).Ultimately it's the tight and witty script matched by an excellent cast that makes this film a pleasure for me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"As Marylin sings in this film ""I couldn't aspire, to anything higher..."" - a comedy masterpiece!","What can you say about this movie that has not been said before?A genuine classic, the basics run as follows... Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis and the ever-fabulous Jack Lemmon...... the boys do drag, Marilyn sings occaisionally, looks edible in practically see-through dresses AND acts well to boot...Lemmon and Curtis play musicians accidentally caught up in the St Valentine's Day Massacre... they go on the run in the only band which will hire them - an all female band which means their only option is to drag up and bluff their way along - and meet up with marginally alcoholic and slightly unhinged Marilyn.. some chaos ensues as Curtis tries to woo her and Lemmon unwillingly finds a suitor for himself...The film is surprisingly touching in places but is basically a lovely silly comedy. It regularly appears in lists proclaiming it to be one of the 100 best movies of all time and quite rightly so. Marilyn - despite suffereing a miscarriage during filming - is on superb form, Jack Lemmon looks almost attractive in drag and Tony Curtis actually avoids being too slimy and annoying. The drag scenes are wonderfully underplayed and the classy use of black and white photography throughout helps make both the drag and the period setting look plausible.Highlights include Tony Curtis's Cary Grant impression (for those of you uneducated in the fabulousness of Cary Grant check out Bringing Up Baby, also on this term), Jack Lemmon being romanced in great style - which leads to just about the best last line of a movie of all time - and Marilyn looking glorious of course.If you've never seen this movie you really really should; if you already have then I am sure you need no persuasion to see it again!",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Awesome, it really is!","Sit back and enjoy this comedy, I don't believe in greatest this and that when it comes to films, but boy, this is superb.The acting here is fantastic, all actors, even Monroe are on top form.The direction by Wilder is superb, the guy's style in this picture is perfect. He directed this film in a very clever way, by using one camera for the majority of the scenes, he could easily edit the film together without studio interference.The script is well written. The dialogue between Lemmon and Curtis is beautifully balanced.Monroe is just too hot for the screen in this picture. Although, Monroe had major off-screen problems (83 takes to get things right) she is fantastic on-screen. She may not have the best lines, but what the heck! She plays the role very well.Overall, this is awesome, it really is.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Jell-O on Springs,"Greetings again from the darkness. Billy Wilder's classic was the latest in the comedy series sponsored by Dallas Film Society and Dallas Morning News. It is almost always ranked as one of the top comedy films of all-time, and often the best ever. While that's a bit higher than I would rank it, there is little doubt that it has earned its enduring place in cinematic history. To fully understand the impact of the film, it helps to remind yourself of the times ... it was filmed more than 50 years ago. What we might call tame today, was incredibly risqué and daring for the times.What really stands out while watching the film is just what an incredible screen presence Marilyn Monroe possessed. It is quite challenging to take your eyes off her during any of her scenes. I am at a loss to come up with any other actor or actress who even comes close to this level of camera-cornering. Greta Garbo and Marlon Brando were great, but Marilyn is transcendent while on screen. Of course, the reports of her personal issues are legendary. Supposedly on this film, she was constantly 2-3 hours late, couldn't remember her lines and had to be coddled by all involved. Still, the final product is stunning and director Billy Wilder understood that no other actress could be substituted. Sadly, Marilyn only made two more films and was dead 3 years after this film was released.As wonderful as Marilyn is, this is really the story of Joe and Jerry, or Josephine and Daphne, or even Junior. Those five characters are all played with crackling comedy timing by Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon. Lemmon, as Daphne, is especially terrific as he tango's the night away with Osgood Fielding III (played by Joe E Brown). Curtis is at his best when courting Marilyn's Sugar Kane while sporting his Cary Grant impersonation and driving the boat backwards.There are so many classic comedy moments in this film, and though it is based on a 1935 French farce titled Fanfare d'Amour, Wilder and his co-writer and frequent collaborator I.A.L. Diamond made it their own by adding the gangster story line. Seeing notorious movie bad guy George Raft tied to the 1929 Chicago St Valentine's Day Massacre adds a dimension that many writers/directors would be unable to handle. Instead, Wilder adds his frenetic dialogue and mixes in some wild double-entendre's, a touch of Marx Brothers, and the sensuous singing of Marilyn to deliver a world class comedy.The Florida scenes were filmed at the historical Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, which remains a very popular resort location even today. Marilyn sings ""I Wanna Be Loved By You"" and ""I'm Through With Love"" in such a way that her character's naivety adds a dimension that breaks the heart of Joe (Curtis) and mesmerizes the viewer. Billy Wilder is certainly one of the Hollywood giants and delivered such classics as Sunset Blvd, The Apartment, Irma laDouce, and Witness for the Prosecution. His excellence spans numerous film genres, and we admire his patience and proficiency in juggling the issues required to pull off Some Like it Hot ... and avoid the fuzzy end of the lollipop.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Classic comedy featuring several screen greats.,"Billy Wilder's Some like it hot is a fabulous crime comedy, which sees two musicians, Joe and Jerry disguise themselves as Josephine and Daphne in order to escape a criminal gang.For my shame, this is the first film I've ever seen with Marilyn Monroe in, and all I can say is she was just sublime, surely one of Hollywood's most beautiful leading ladies, her presence is uplifting, enchanting, somewhat Hypnotic, she has a presence, you watch in awe.This film is riotously funny, there is definitely a fair amount of slapstick, but for 1959, I'm surprised by just how dark some of the humour was, not what I was expecting, it's humour that feels as fresh now as it must have been during its release.From the opening car chase sequences, to the first time we get to see Josephine and Daphne, to the raucous ending, it's a thrill ride.Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon were terrific, Marilyn Monroe was just sublime, what a beauty.10/10.'Nobody's perfect.'",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
An outrageous and hilarious comedy.,"Billy Wilder goes the limits in this outrageous and very funny comedy about two musicians going undercover as women to avoid the mob. It is a ridiculous premise, but Wilder and Diamond's script perfectly balances the comedy with scenes of love and romance. Curtis and Monroe have great chemistry together, and Lemmon is superb as the comedy relief in the ""serious"" scenes with George Raft. Even these are something to laugh at, but the film is not to be taken seriously; just to be laughed at. It has been almost fifty years since it was released and people still laugh at it. I have seen it three or four times and it is still as funny as seeing it for the first time. That is the true test of a comedy and Some Like It Hot passes with flying colors.

Some Like It Hot (1959),"Directed by Billy Wilder. Starring Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis, Marilyn Monroe, Joe E. Brown, Joan Shawlee, George Raft, Dave Barry, Pat O'Brien, Nehemiah Persoff, Edward G. Robinson Jr., Al Breneman.Legendary Billy Wilder burlesque comedy (co-written alongside I. A. L. Diamond) with Prohibition-era musicians Lemmon and Curtis going on the run in drag with an all-female band after witnessing the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. Well-structured and paced until the overextended home stretch, with Lemmon and Curtis in fine form (the former gets most of the best lines, the latter trots out a pretty amusing Cary Grant impersonation), despite the fact that neither one is remotely convincing as a member of the opposite sex; trouble is, it's just not all that funny, stretching its one-joke premise razor thin and lacking invention during the expected plot complications. Amusing enough to rate as decent entertainment, but its reputation as one of the funniest films of all-time is puzzling; maybe one's mileage would improve if they find men wearing women's clothes inherently funny by concept alone? At least Brown's famous final line earns its reputation.63/100",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
The only reason I made it through this is to try to understand those who like it,"Every genre has to be judged by its own standards. To be good, a drama film should be interesting, a mystery film should be mysterious and surprising, a musical should have good songs, a horror film should be frightening, and more to the point here, a comedy should be funny. There. I said it. A comedy should at some point have some joke that is in some way amusing. This seems to me to be a pretty solid and logical test of quality. And going by it, Some Like it Hot is not a good movie. In fact, it's an utterly terrible movie. Don't accuse me of being unable to deal with subtle humor; I can. P.G. Wodehouse and Henry Fielding are subtle, and I really like them. This isn't subtle. This is really in your face and painfully, dreadfully unfunny. There seriously isn't one joke in this that isn't massively predictable and totally unamusing. And as for the acting? They're not brilliant performances. They're really, really annoying, and it made me happy when all three of the main characters just stopped talking. This is a comedy, and a comedy is supposed to be funny. This isn't funny, and so it's a catastrophic failure. I suppose I'm happy for those of you as can find something to enjoy here, but I really don't get what it is.",1.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A well timed comedy with a wonderful dialogue,"Some Like it Hot will have a Danish re-premiere on Marilyn Monroes 75th birthday June 1st 2001, and making the text for some advertising material in that connection I saw the movie again and liked it more than ever. Most comedies about men in womens' clothings have a vulgar humour. This is, of course, not the case for films like ""Tootsie"" and ""Some Like it Hot"" in which Billy Wilder using black and white instead of colours turns down the importance of the change of sex in many ways so that you can concentrate on the comedy which is extraordinarily well timed with a spiritual dialogue. The acting of Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis, and Marilyn Monroe, not to mention Joe E Brown, Pat O'Brien and George Raft is out of this world, and of course it is possible to make a mafia war comical. Some scenes almost remind you of a Marx Brothers' movie. Like when a small berth in a train sleeping car in a few seconds is overcrowded with beautiful girls mixing Manhattan-drinks in their hot-water bottle while Jack Lemmon is desperately trying to remind himself that -- just then -- he is a girl, and Marilyn Monroe in seconds (with her back towards the camera!) produces perfect small, square ice-cubes out of a huge ice block. The music is enchanting like the Marilyn Monroe-songs which are all so well known.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
As hot as it gets,"A Comedy that has it all, and lacks absolutely nothing. ""Nobody's perfect"" may be an inherent truism, but ""Some Like it Hot"" is a definite somebody in the universe of cinema, thus it IS perfect in every sense. Swing, sex and slapstick, (three words that immediately come to mind when trying to describe it) , are a mix so delicious, so fruitful in its possibilities that one cannot imagine a film which can live up to them, and yet this one does. Marilyn, her trademark, displeasingly infantile voice aside, is a bombshell of thermonuclear dimensions, whose powers of titillation will not expire so long as there are hormones and/or Viagra. The sexual content, for socio-historical reasons cannot be as explicit as we've come to expect, but there's still plenty of it, from Monroe's see-through outfit to the double entendre worthy of the Farelli Brothers (""What do I do if it's an emergency ? - Pull the emergency break!"" ), including overtly gay themes that have a cult following of their own. The Lemmon/Curtis duo operates with gleeful, unrestrained vitality that can only be likened to Chaplin in his heyday.

Jack Lemmon gives a hilarious performance as he falls for the delicious Marilyn Monroe while fighting off the advances of wealthy Osgood Fielding III. Then he takes a left turn, and it becomes comedy classic. Meanwhile Tony Curtis plays triple roles. And there's nothing better than Marilyn Monroe singing 'I Wanna Be Loved by You'.

A lot of fun and one of the best final lines in film history...,"This is a wonderfully entertaining film that has to have one of the best final scenes in movie history--seeing Joe E. Brown and Jack Lemmon in this scene is truly delightful. However, I do wonder if perhaps, maybe, the film is a tiny bit overrated--especially since it is now ranked relatively high on IMDb's Top 250 list. It's an exceptional film...I just don't see it as quite THAT exceptional.Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon stumble upon a mob hit. And, since mobsters really DON'T like witnesses, they know they'd better hide--and quick. So they hit upon the idea of hiding in an all-ladies' band, as they, too, are musicians. There, Tony falls in love with Marilyn Monroe--and it's hard for him to balance his female persona with the bookish guy he also pretends to be to impress her. As for Jack, he becomes the focus of a rich older man's attentions (Joe E. Brown). So how do they both balance these relationships with a strong desire NOT to be killed by the mob? The film has some nice supporting acting by George Raft and Pat O'Brien-and it's nice to see them return to films. As for the acting, it's generally very good, though I think Curtis' acting is a bit broad at times--but oddly charming as well.Overall, there's a lot to enjoy and it's fun throughout.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Still fresh after almost sixty years,"Opening in 1929 in Chicago musicians Joe and Jerry witness a mob assassination, committed by Spats Colombo, so have to go on the run. There are jobs with a band that is heading to Miami... there is just one catch; they are all girls. By the time the train is ready to head south Joe and Jerry have become Josephine and Daphne. On the journey they get to know the other girls and as Joe talks to singer Sugar and learns how she hopes to meet a bespectacled millionaire with a yacht rather than the usual succession on no-good saxophone players (Joe plays the Sax). Once in Miami sets about becoming just that man while a real millionaire, Osgood Fielding III, is attracted to Jerry's 'Daphne'! If that weren't enough Spats is in in town for a mob conference.This film may be in black and white and almost sixty years old but don't let that put you off; it is still fresh and very funny. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are great as 'Josephine' and 'Daphne'; they may not be the most beautiful of women but they do at least look feminine enough that one can believe they would be mistaken for women. Marilyn Monroe is on top form as Sugar; particularly in the scenes were she is wooed by Joe's 'Shell Oil Jnr' persona. The laughs come thick and fast combining elements of farce and slapstick. One might worry that 'fifties morality' would be a problem but the attitudes are far more modern than one might expect. Overall I'd definitely say this film is a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Some Like It Lukewarm,"An amusing, well-packaged comedy, but with the humour too broad and self-conscious to ever be the classic it's chalked up to be.There seems to be some debate over which of the two male leads is funniest. Clearly it's Tony Curtis (Who has recently denied he ever said his infamous ""kissing Marilyn was like kissing Hitler"" quote - Lemmon insists he did), who gets a dual role, not just as a female impersonator but as a Cary Grant send-up. After this superb take-off you can never watch a Grant film in quite the same way again. Curtis is better looking, cooler and much subtler in the role than Lemmon. To this regard, Jack irksomely overplays his part, his mannerisms and body language constantly over the top. There are some great lines (""I'll make it up to you"" ""You're making it up pretty good so far""; He's got an empty stomach and it's gone to his head"") and, apart from dubious soft focus for Marilyn's close-ups, the direction is excellent for a screwball comedy. The decision to film in black and white was also a good move. And look out for some great in-jokes, such as George Raft scolding a coin-tossing crook with ""Where'd you get that cheap trick?""Perhaps the 120-minute running time is too long for the subject matter, and it does get a bit draggy in parts. Forty-two years have passed since the film was made, so that the somewhat naive laughs of gender and sexuality confusions no longer pack the same punch in a more enlightened age. Nevertheless, as an historical document this is still an important work.",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"""I Want to be A Bull Again""","Billy Wilder being as daring as he could with Code still firmly in place decides to stretch all the gender boundaries he could with this comedy in drag. The results some say resulted in the funniest film ever made.Some Like It Hot concerns a couple of jazz age musicians in 1929 witnessing the murder of informant George E. Stone. Of course the head doer George Raft spots our intrepid duo and Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are forced to flee Chicago.The getaway plan. Take a gig with an all woman orchestra going south to Florida. The orchestra has Marilyn Monroe as a singer so the trip will have its pleasant diversity.After the trouble Wilder had with Monroe on The Seven Year Itch he swore he wouldn't do another film with her. But United Artists wanted a big name for box office guarantee before he could get the financing and Curtis and Lemmon weren't big enough. So Monroe was signed and by all accounts the picture was another trial to make for all concerned.Tony Curtis's feelings were well known about Monroe, he didn't like her. Yet his scenes with her were very funny indeed both with him in drag and doing a spoof of his idol, Cary Grant.Jack Lemmon was far more philosophical. I saw him in an interview once simply say that Marilyn was a girl with a whole lot of problems and unrealized talent when she died. That's what you would expect from Lemmon, one of the nicest people ever in the film industry.Jack Lemmon also got an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. But Some Like It Hot ran into the year of Ben-Hur sweeping all the Oscars that year. It wasn't even nominated for Best Picture. Billy Wilder lost for Best Director. The only Oscar it did win was for Orry-Kelly for costume design for those recreations from the Twenties and the special costumes that Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis wore.Billy Wilder sprinkled his cast with a lot of people identified with the gangster genre. Who more than George Raft who really lived the part in real life. And others like George E. Stone, Mike Mazurki, and Nehemiah Persoff. Pat O'Brien plays the federal man on the trail of the mobsters and in his memoirs O'Brien thanked Billy Wilder profusely for giving him a part in a classic film when his career hit the skids in the Fifties.Of course the real daring here was Joe E. Brown as the dissolute playboy and his infatuation with Jack Lemmon in drag. Today Brown's character would be really a gay guy who's into drag queens and Lemmon after some initial misgivings might just decide that gay for pay pays a lot better than playing the bull fiddle. But the Code while not broken was stretched a might in Some Like It Hot.A film that didn't get into the top five in 1959 is now considered the funniest comedy of all time. You won't get any argument from me over that one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Maybe not the greatest ever but still quite good,"Some Like It Hot is often hailed as the greatest comedy film of all time. That's probably a stretch. It may not be the greatest ever but it's still very good and thoroughly enjoyable. Driven by the outstanding performances of three top-notch stars in Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis and the one and only Marilyn Monroe, Some Like It Hot will make you smile, make you laugh and maybe even make you cry but only because you're laughing so hard at times. If you go in expecting the greatest movie ever, you may end up being a touch disappointed. If you go in with more reasonable expectations you can't help but enjoy this delightful screwball comedy.The setup of this film's plot almost guarantees comic gold and sure enough it pays off. Curtis and Lemmon play Joe and Jerry, two musicians in Prohibition-era Chicago who witness a mob hit and have to get the heck out of town before they end up dead. They end up donning dresses, posing as women and joining an all-girl orchestra headed for Florida. Reborn, so to speak, as Josephine and Daphne the pair plan to ditch the band and resume their normal, non-dress wearing, lives as soon as they hit Florida. But on their new orchestra's train ride to the Sunshine State there is a complication. That complication comes in the shape (and oh what a shape!) of singer/ukulele player Sugar Kane Kowalczyk, played by the incomparable Monroe. Needless to say our two men find themselves very much attracted to the bubbly, beautiful Sugar. Of course the fact that they are ""women"" very much complicates things. Hilarity ensues.Once the orchestra hits Florida this film really takes off. Joe, or Josephine if you prefer, decides he and Jerry/Daphne should stick around for a while. Taking a break from being disguised as a woman, and now posing as a Shell Oil millionaire, Joe tries to woo Sugar. Meanwhile an actual millionaire falls for ""Daphne"" which obviously causes all kinds of complications for Jerry. Much of what ensues is simply priceless. There are a few jokes and gags which fall flat but there is so much here that works you forgive the film for the moments which don't quite measure up. And given the rather juvenile nature of so many modern comedies the more subtle nature of the comedy here is a blessed relief. This movie presents a truly ridiculous situation but it's never over the top. Director Billy Wilder found just the right tone to make the film work and the truly remarkable cast brings the story to life. There are some terrific supporting performances but it is the big three of Monroe, Curtis and Lemmon who really make this film work. What can you say about Marilyn Monroe that hasn't already been said? She simply owns the screen. Watch her perform the song ""I Wanna Be Loved by You"" and I dare you not to fall in love. If this film has a straight man, Curtis is it. He's suave, reserved, and altogether perfect no matter which disguise he happens to be in at any given moment. But in this film it may be Lemmon who shines most of all. He pours his heart and soul into being ""Daphne"" and it is an absolute treat to watch. Curtis and Monroe are both terrific and certainly have their share of moments and witty one-liners but the best moments and best lines seem to be reserved for Lemmon. It's obvious Lemmon had a lot of fun making this film. You'll have a lot of fun watching it. So what if it's not the ""best comedy ever""? It's a wonderfully written, brilliantly performed, incredibly enjoyable film. That's more than enough to make it well worth your while.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Passage of time has not been kind,"A film containing at least one of the best actors of the 50's and 60' Jack Lemmon. I feel he is the star of the film and carries to an extent some of the other performances. The film is well set in the 1929 period and faithful to the period detail. However I feel despite being a huge Jack Lemmon Fan that it has not faired well from the passage of time. With a lot of films of 40 to 50 years ago there is a tendency to view with rosy coloured glasses and not from having sat through it again and critically evaluated it. The humour is particularly dated and the plot with honesty thin. Okay it was a great film for its time, but films have improved in the 48 years since this was made.",1.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
The Wilder Monroe,"Not all of Wilder's projects are as well designed as this. But among the best designed of films before 1960 are his.This is classic because its about sex as so, so many movies are. But it uses Monroe in ways that greatly exceed her ability to use herself. I believe that the Monroe legend is because of Wilder's placing of her in a context that amplified her appeal.Wilder had worked with her before. He selected and co-wrote the screenplay around her, adapting as he went.The situation is set up to provide a context of shifting sexual identity so that she can anchor the thing with us concluding that yes, this is sex. This is what it means to be a desirable woman.And its not just the obvious things, the drag identities. Its in the girl jazz band. The machine gunner jumping out of a cake instead of a stripper, the business of a funeral really being a party, the henpecked manager: pronounced ""beanstalk."" Even in boozing out of a hot water bottle.Its so deft in structure, so accommodating to her strengths and weaknesses, that it makes me cry, knowing that Wilder only was tuned properly for two films. And this one was essentially a waste, except for getting her past the tipping point of being a legend, a presidential plaything and Warhol icon.The problem of this movie is that after its all engineered and polished, after all the targeting and focus, it just isn't that funny. What was funny sixty years ago  men in drag is screwball situations  just doesn't catch today. You have to do a context reset and you might like who you pretend to be.Its a great structure, a masterpiece of understanding and designing cinema for a specific purpose. And a sad waste.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
My brief review of the film,"A delightful cross-dressing comedy, this was one of the first of its type and it still is one of the funniest. It is very cleverly written, impeccably acted, particularly by Joe E. Brown, and features excellent chemistry between the two leads. There are parallels in the film to actual events and attitudes that existed in the 1920s, giving the film a historical insight as an extra virtue. The film works so well not just because of its historical parallels but also because it spoofs gangster films and not just the cross-dressing joke. Overall it is a wonderful film that sparkles along to its glitzy Academy Awarding winning costume design.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Snappy and hilarious,"It isn't the first time men were in drag on the screen and certainly not the last, but surely it must be the funniest example.I'll skip the plot and just make a few offhand observations. One is that the writers put a near-perfect polish on this script. They didn't simply throw gags and comic situations into the story hoping they would all add up to a funny movie. Instead they worked running gags into the dialog. Some of them are so utterly without symbolic -- or even sensible -- content that they become in themselves sidesplitting. ""Type O blood."" It must come up half a dozen times in outrageously irrelevant contexts.And one that took me at least ten viewings to catch. I will now spell it out in case anyone out there is as dull as I've been. Near the beginning, when Joe and Jerry are still Joe and Jerry, Joe pitches some woo to Nellie Wymeyer in order to borrow her car, a Hupmobile 1929. An hour into the film, long after this brief exchange has been forgotten, Josephine has cornered Sugar on ""his"" yacht and explains to her the origin of his impotence. It's an imaginative and tragic tale. It seems he met his only true love at the Grand Canyon. She was as blind as he was. They stood together on the edge of the highest cliff. He took off his glasses. She took off her glasses. He took a step towards her. She took a step towards him. ""Oh, no!"" cries Sugar. ""Yes. Eight hours later they brought her up -- by mule."" That's not the running gag though. The running gag is that while Josephine is improvising this blatantly phony yarn, making it up as he goes along, free associating, he mentions that the girl he loved was named Nellie and that her father was president of Hupmobile. Absolutely nothing more is made of the connection between Nellie Wymeyer's Hupmobile and this baloney Josephine is slicing -- in fact he skips rather blithely over it.I don't think I'll give away any other gags, which means I can't really describe the movie in any detail.But mention should be made of the score and the arrangements of the contemporary tunes, for which I guess Adolph Deutsch is responsible. They're wacky when that's called for and sweet in an old-fashioned way when ballads are required. ""Stairway to the Stars"" has never sounded so romantic, and ""I'm Through With Love"" more wistful. (Catch the key change after Monroe finishes singing.) The underscore is remarkable too -- a frenetic combination of bass and tenor saxophone. (What else?) Monroe seems a bit thick waisted but it doesn't detract from her sex appeal because she's so Hollywood gorgeous. That transparent dress she almost has on during her love scene with Tony Curtis doesn't dampen her appeal either.The two male leads give unimpeachable performances. I know Tony Curtis has often been criticized for his ""mannerisms"" and his accent but they fit his character well enough in the Bing Crosby part, while Jack Lemon couldn't be improved upon in the Bob Hope part of the continually hoodwinked, constantly cackling breathlessly. All the supports are just about right too. Sid Polyakoff -- ""Spielt mit der PhilharMONic!"" And where on this planet did casting find all those goons who play George Raft's companions. ""These are my lawyers. All Harvard men."" Those FACES.I can't find anything bad to say about the movie. It's funny from beginning to end. If you haven't seen it yet, you owe it to yourself to catch it when you have a chance.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"In making a Comedy Film, Nobody's Perfect!  But Billy Wilder & Company got pretty damn close!","The Great Famous as well as the Great Infamous occurrences in a nation's history are and always will be looked upon as subjects worthy of a film treatment. Whether an incident were to be filmed from a story and its screenplay form written directly for the screen or an adaptation of a Novel, a Short Story or a Stage Play, they are an important element of formulating our image of our World. Right or wrong, it is a fact of life and one that we must learn to live with.A good example of just what we are driving at is the occurrences of October 26, 1881 in Tombstone, Arizona. Known as ""The Gunfight at O.K. Corral"", the incident is probably the best known single shoot-em-up incident in the History of the Old West. Countless references are made to it in our Western Movies, be they Major Motion Pictures or the ""B"" Picture Series of the Matinée & Bubble Gum Set.Equally as familiar to the movie going public and probably the best known example of Urban Gangster violence of the 'Lawless Prohibition/Gangster Era, ""The St.Valentine's Day Massacre"" has been given Film treatment many times. It is featured in the Rod Steiger's Starring Title Role as AL CAPONE (Allied Artists, 1959).Director Roger Corman gave us THE ST. VALENTINE'S DAY MASSACRE (Los Altos Productions / 20th Century-Fox, 1967); devoting the entire 100 minutes of screen time to the behind the scenes incidents leading up to it and to the Great Mass Murder.With Ben Gazzara in the title role, we had CAPONE (Santa Fe Productions/ 20th Century-Fox, 1975), also which had the Massacre and its preparation and aftermath as central events in the story.With the dramatic come the comedies, spoofs, comedians, the social commentators and the satirists. There surely would be a comedy that would at least make mention of the Massacre in passing.And it happened. Producer/co-Writer/Director Billy Wilder gave us SOME LIKE IT HOT (Ashton Prod./Mirisch Corp.-United Artists, 1959). To a hilariously great script, Directot Wilder added plenty of Hollywood Star Power in Miss Marilyn Monroe, Mr. Tony Curtis and Mr. Jack Lemmon. In supporting position, we saw the likes of veteran, old pros like Joe E. Brown (as Millionaire Osgood Fielding III), George Raft (as 'Spats' Colombo), Pat O'Brien (as Detective Mulligan), Nehimiah Persoff (as Little Boneparte), Joan Shawlee (Sweet Sue), Billy Gray (Sig Pokikoff), George E.

The fun continues.The film is wild, fast paced and cleverly written. It has guaranteed laughs through-out. Mr. Wilder and Company, have constructed a sort of cross between the old James Cagney/Humphrey Bogart feature, THE ROARING TWENTIES (Warner Brothers, 1939) and a Mack Sennett Silent Keystone Comedy. They get us Laughing and keep it that way.The filming used the City of Coronado in Suburban San Diego, as the location doubling for an unavailable State of Florida. Both the beautiful Coronado Beach and the 1920's styled Coronado Hotel were put to use to great effect.And just one more thing before we signoff for now. Of all the veteran players appearing in the movie, it is the fine performance of Mr. Joe E. Brown which steals more than his share of the film. Joe E. Brown had his hey day in a series of comedies done I the 1930's and had been relegated to supporting riles since then. The role of eccentric Millionaire Osgood Fielding III, who finds himself attracted to 'Daphne', the Bull Fiddle Player (Jack Lemmon).And it is Joe E. Brown who speaks the memorable last line of dialogue, which is, no, no! I won't tell! If you don't know, buy it or rent it; but see it! Don't wait another Day!",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A film that will always endure the test of time,"There are certain films that are just so 'classic' that when one mentions it, they are usually met with a knowing smile. 'Some Like it Hot', directed by the great Billy Wilder is one of those films.'Some Like it Hot' is Wilder's gender-bending comedy wherein two small time musicians, Gerald (Jack Lemmon) and Joe (Tony Curtis) find themselves witnesses to the St. Valentine's Day massacre in Chicago, 1929. They escape, only to find that the only way they can afford to leave town is by dressing up as women and joining an all-woman band traveling to Florida. When Sugar (Marilyn Monroe), a singer and band member enters the picture, the two men fight over her and come up with ways to romance her, while trying to keep their identities (and genders) secret. This works out better for Joe, who finds himself falling for her, while Lemmon ends up with a romantic interest of his own. All the while, the two are threatened with discovery by the band leader, and eventually, by the gangsters who have been holding a nationwide search for them.I actually watched 'Some Like it Hot' during a Film Club meeting and realized that I had seen this film about a dozen and a half times. Instead of being bored, however, I was afforded the luxury of 'discovering' certain things that I either hadn't noticed before, or had at least glossed over. One thing is that the script is really quite good. Not only does 'Some Like it Hot' have arguably the greatest last line of any film ever, but some of the rapid fire dialogue is hilarious; made even better by the great delivery by the actors. Lemmon and Curtis are always good, but Monroe, while not a great actress is good in this film, and has seriously never looked more beautiful. One other element is some of the chances the film took. There were some risqué scenes and lines that I still am stunned made it through the censors at the time. ('It's not how long it takes; it's who's taking you.')Many good things have been said about 'Some Like it Hot', and most of it is true. It is truly a classic film, and Wilder is a brilliant filmmaker whose diversity is almost unparalleled. Check it out if you haven't seen it.--Shelly",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Hilarious comedy, with brilliant performances and great writing","Some Like it Hot is a truly delightful and hilarious comedy, complete with brilliant performances and great writing. This is the sort of comedy that has the desire of sex as part of the plot, and while there have been films that have ignored this, this film embraces it to stellar effect. The plot is brilliant in construction and almost elaborate, about two men escape after witnessing a mob fight, and join an all female band disguised as women, and this is where the film gets complicated. The direction from Billy Wilder is spot on, the cinematography is beautiful and the music is gorgeous. Other than the performances, the real treasure comes in the script, a mother load of classically delicious lines that are not only funny but intelligent as well. The performances are note perfect, while Tony Curtis and Jack Curtis give truly wonderful performances, it is the beautiful Marilyn Monroe in a deliciously seductive and sly performance who steals the acting honours. All in all, a truly wonderful comedy, right up there with comedies like Duck Soup and Night At the Opera as one of the best comedies of all time. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Has anyone actually watched this movie?!?!,"Stands the test of time, does it? If the movie and its subject matter weren't so utterly tame by today's standards, perhaps this assertion would hold, but as it is, this heap is a relic of the deep dark past. There were two (and only two!) moments wherein I didn't actually laugh, but merely stated: ""that was kind of funny..."" that's it, I spoke the words, didn't actually laugh! The only thing that stands out about this ""greatest comedy of all time"" is the fact that Marilyn Monroe is so chunky! Not to condone our societies current body image ideals, but if Marilyn Monroe was even attempting to make it into movies these days, I doubt she would get her foot in the door... yet another counter to the ""stands the test of time"" statements. Additionally, neither of the two lead actors' performances even hold up to much of their other work... come on, tony Curtis was funnier in Spartacus! And Lemmon, as we know, just aged like a fine wine. At best, this is a really lame rated-G caliber attempted goof-ball romp that should entertain only very young children; but in reality, it is just an incredibly boring old movie that should not have survived past the decade in which it was born.",1.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

"there's every reason to like ""Some Like It Hot""","Back in the days when certain things were taboo in movies, there were always directors who were looking for ways to push the limits. Billy Wilder did this in ""Some Like It Hot"", the movie that may very well have been the best movie that he, Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon ever did.Curtis and Lemmon play Joe and Jerry, two musicians in 1929 Chicago who have to flee a speakeasy before a police raid. Now unemployed, they get a job to play at an out of town joint. While they are getting the car, they witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, when one group of mobsters murdered another group. Desperate to hide, they dress up as women and get jobs in an all-female band, using the pseudonyms Josephine and Daphne. In this band, they meet Sugar Kane Kowalczyk (Marilyn Monroe), the sexiest singer imaginable. When the band arrives in Florida is when the real nuttiness begins. ""Daphne"" gets seduced by millionaire Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown), while ""Josephine"" pretends to be a millionaire named Junior, who seduces Sugar Kane. But then, the mobsters who were behind the massacre arrive.What is so great about this movie is how they push the limits. Before calling the all-female band, Joe tells Jerry that they're going to shave their legs. You must realize that back then, talking about legs was like talking about genitals. And just the idea of men dressing as women might be interpreted as saying that they're gay (Joe and Jerry are not gay). Finally, the last line in the movie is all about acceptance, no matter who someone is. But all in all, ""Some Like It Hot"" gets eleven out of ten stars in my book, as it is so damn hilarious and has some really good values. Splendid.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Monroe shows off her real comedy talent,"Comedy set in the late 20s/early 30s features stereotypes of the era -- bombshell torch singer (Monroe, of course), hard-as-nails gangster boss (Raft, of course), and go-getter protagonists (Lemmon and Curtis, of course).

Some of the jokes are flat, but the visual humor can't fail -- especially Lemmon in his crossdressing disguise, which he seems to grow more and more into until his final scene where he and Joe E.

"Runnin' Wild with Curtis, Lemmon, and Monroe...","Brazen, rambunctious, lascivious comedy, expertly written by Billy Wilder (who also directed) and I.A.L. Diamond from a story by R. Thoeren and Michael Logan. High-spirited slapstick, with both sharp and soft edges, involves two luckless Prohibition-era musicians in Chicago who inadvertently witness the St. Valentine's Day massacre; they take it on the lam after disguising themselves as women, becoming part of an all-female jazz combo! Hilarious film still delivers the goods, from Tony Curtis' Cary Grant impression (to win over chanteuse Marilyn Monroe) to Jack Lemmon inexplicably falling for a wacky elderly millionaire (the priceless Joe E.

Utter Perfection,"Why don't they make 'em like they used to? Marilyn, Jack, Tony, Joe E. Brown, George Raft, etc....you just can't compile a cast like that anymore. Perhaps that's what makes the film work so well, the casting.  As in all Wilder films, everyone was *just* right for their part, and trying to come up with alternatives proves fruitless, especially for Marilyn's role [what can be said about her that hasn't been said before? The ""I Wanna Be Loved By You"" sequence is one of the sexiest in cinema, and it was accomplished completely through suggestion.  Notice Wilder's extremely effective use of the spotlight in combination with the black and white cinematography;  Marilyn never looked more luminous].I really can't imagine Frank Sinatra in the Tony Curtis role (Wilder's first choice, apparently), because Curtis does an amazing job, as does Lemmon. They are convincing as women without going over the top (although Lemmon comes close), and Curtis's Cary Grant impression was spot-on. Wilder was a genius, pure and simple.  Who has had a better track record? [Some Like It Hot, The Apartment, Witness For The Prosecution, One Two Three, Lost Weekend, Double Indemnity (another universally acknowledged masterpiece), Ace In The Hole, Sunset Boulevard.....the list just goes on and on].What's supremely interesting about this movie is that, over the past 40 years, its appeal has not waned.  It's just as raucous and hilarious now as it was then, albeit less shocking.  But if you want shocking, go see Scary Movie.  And if you want comedy (the best of all time, no less), go see Some Like It Hot.  So good it should be required viewing.Note:  Another reviewer commented that Marilyn seemed ""chunky,"" but this is because she had a real woman's body, not the ""anorexic with implants"" image we are weaned on in today's world; this is the secret to her enduring sex appeal.  If Pamela Anderson Lee were playing Sugar, would it be half as sexy (or half as funny) as it is today?",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Solid comedy,"The highly regarded Billy Wilder comedy Some Like It Hot relies on an original, really offbeat and audacious plot for the time (1959), where savoury and incredibly well written dialogues fly for two hours. The adventures of these two travesties are very enjoyable to follow, and the Curtis-Lemmon did a perfect job, a notch above Marylin Monroe even though she is coherent with her character.Overall, the comical potential has been well exploited, even if, due to the changes in mores, what seemed improbable and funny back then doesn't shock anymore. Moreover, the script sometimes goes through slow passages with endless scenes as the one on the boat, and one could question the purpose of the musical interludes as they appear more like promotional parts for Monroe. But, despite these few flaws, Some Like It Hot remains a sure bet in the comical genre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Some Like It Hot review,"What a great cinematic experience it is to view Some Like It Hot. The movie provides you with a bit of everything from madcap action, screwball comedy, mob drama, and campy romance, along with a little sugar on top in sweet sensation, Marilyn Monroe. Despite the apparent weight-gain she looks visually stunning, and her close-to-home performance is worth noting as well. There are many subtexts that lie in Billy Wilder's masterpiece, including one that could very well do with Marilyn's character Sugar Kane Kowalczyk. Much like Marilyn, the lounge singing Sugar is searching for love with a decent somebody other than the player-type she often frequents (in the film's case, saxophonists). Perhaps men found this sultry misses too intimidating, making Marilyn's love-life in the real world just the same.Another suggestive undertone could do with the abundant `crisis of masculinity' shot off in the late 1950's. Two middling male musicians (Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon), all dragged out, seem to be granted opportunities they would never have had if remained as `men' (i.e. marrying a millionaire, accepting free trips and consolations, etc.). Is it femininity that gains all? Like Dustin Hoffman's Tootsie, it is apparent these `beauties' really weren't beauties at all; bosses-the mob and Sugar's-pick it up right away. Why the feminine gain? Do men make wiser women than younger girls?All rhetoric aside, Some Like It Hot's concept is a lot simpler: the men join an all girls band heading to Florida, evading the possibilities of being found as the witnesses to a gangland rubout (a.k.a. the St. Valentine's Day Massacre). Of course there are many complications for these `women' along the way, including their intense magnetism towards Sugar. Never is there a dull moment in Some Like It Hot, with quickly paced classical cutting, a wholesome variety of locations, and a brilliant screenplay much to the allure of Wilder's other treasure Sunset Boulevard. Not many movies over 40 years can hold up the laughter presented in Hot. In one of the funnier scenes, a relentless drunkard in the midst of a `funeral parlor' seize-up demands more scotch-filled decaf: `How bout another cup of coffee!' Classic, indeed.5/5 stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Memorable performance from Marilyn.,"Two 1920s jazz musicians Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) flee a gangster ridden Chicago after accidentally witnessing the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. The pair seek refuge by disguising themselves as women and joining an all-girl band, headed by Monroe. Curtis instantly falls for her, and after an hilarious scene in which Lemmon and Curtis spend an evening in a train carriage with the wild women from her band, they end up in Miami, where Curtis attempts to woo Monroe, by reverting to being a male. He pretends to be an impotent millionaire with a Cary Grant voice and mannerisms. Marilyn tries to invigorate him on the sofa by seduction. At the same time, Lemmon is being chased by a real millionaire, in the shape of Osgood E Fielding 111 (Joe E Brown) who is unperturbed by the fact that Lemmon is, in fact, a man.

A hilarious flick.,"Some like it hot is a great comedy. It seemed to be a bit racy for being made in the late 50's, but maybe that's why it is so popular. The humor in this movie is clever and witty. Minus the wardrobe, the music and the look of the cars, it seems like it would be a movie made today, mainly because of the timeless humor.The story line is also very good. The viewer is hooked from the beginning and is on the edge of their seat until the very end. Joe is the undeniable ladies man that plays the sax and Jerry is the paranoid bass player. They take the ride of their lives to save their lives from the mob. They put themselves in a situation that not too many men would be upset about. But jealousy, lies and the fact that they are men gets in the way, causing much humor.The acting in this movie is the best thing about it. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon have a great chemistry and are very believable as best friends. Then throw Marilyn Monroe in the mix and you've got a great group of actors with great chemistry. All of the main characters acted with such ease and the parts just seemed to come so naturally to them.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"One of the greatest, most insane screwball comedy ever to grace theaters.","Some Like It Hot is not an incredibly artistic, graceful film with deeply significant themes of love and sacrifice - it's a screwball comedy.  Yet it is remembered as one of the greatest screwball comedies ever to hit theaters.  It is completely over-the-top, filled with unlikely situations, bizarre coincidences and quirky characters.Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis, playing Joe and Jerry, two down-and-out musicians looking for work in Chicago just before the stock market crash of 1929 that would shove America - and the world - into the Great Depression. The two witness a killing by Al Capone's goons - part of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre - and desperately try to escape to where they will never be found.  Without giving away any details, they find themselves in the midst of a rather precarious situation (today, perhaps a comedy cliché - not so then), involving deception, unrequited love, and relationships with a startling number of combinations of genders.There is a great dynamic between the characters of Lemmon and Curtis.  They are in constant competition to win the heart of Sugar (Marilyn Monroe), a rebellious and decidedly naïve woman who has completely given up on men who are not rich enough to own a yacht.  Lemmon and Curtis are constantly bickering and wanting revenge, yet they are forced to cooperate lest they give away their secret to the onlookers.  Their story gets convoluted the point where it is difficult to remember which is which, with the story's extremely tight pace and the many twists along the way.One cannot say enough about the about the brilliant comedic acting seen here.  Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are funny not merely because of their dialogue, but because of their wild energy.  They slip in and out of roles before they even realize what they're doing, going from complacent to angry to scared witless without missing a beat.  Joe E. Brown is sure to get under your skin as Osgood Fielding III.  And Marilyn Monroe - well, she mostly shows a lot of cleavage.Ultimately ""Some Like it Hot"" is a tightly compressed batch of hilarity. There is a reason why it is listed as the American Film Institute's #1 comedy (although this reviewer doesn't entirely agree with that claim). Modern movie-goers shouldn't be turned off by its black-and-white nature; it puts modern buddy comedies to shame.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Very funny!,"""Some Like it Hot"" is the first of its kind. By that I mean that countless movies followed with the same plot: men can't do something being men so they dress up as women only to fall for a drop-dead gorgeous woman who just so happens to be really close with them. This movie however is the first to do this and does it in the best way possible.What's good about ""Some Like it Hot"" is that it stays away from clichés and doesn't center around friendship and heartbreak, but moreso on the humor aspect of the movie. Almost every scene in the movie keeps you watching and throws you in a hysterical fit. It's a movie that shouldn't be over-analyzed, and should be watched solely for entertainment.Jack Lemon is brilliant in his Oscar-nominated performance as the witty and eccentric Dephne, and plays his character with such convincing mannerism that we tend to forget it's actually a man. In one hilarious and unforgettable scene, 'Daphne' convinces himself he's a woman by telling Joe 'Josephine' (Tony Curtis) that he's never been happier because a millionaire proposed to him. It is both comical and original, showing that you can only pretend to be someone for so long.Marilyn Manroe co-stars as Sugar, a sexy and beautiful alcoholic musician who falls for Joe's third identity, Junior. This creates an even more comic-genius plot, having countless identities running around trying to stay in character. It definitely defines comedy brilliance.The whole concept of the story of ""Some Like it Hot"" is complete comic material. This movie allowed the three main actors to really reach out and play around with their roles and to have fun while doing it. It's not often that a movie features a lot of improvisation in order for the character to feel both real and staged.Influencing countless movies, comedies and romantic dramas alike, ""Some Like it Hot"" still stands as one of the best comedies of all time. And for a good reason.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
All that jazz.,"'Some Like It Hot (1959)' focuses upon two musicians who witness a murder and must go on the run from the mob, eventually hiding out in an all-girls jazz band. It finds most of its comedy from its stars' bumbling attempts to balance their drag personas with their real ones. Curtis' character falls in love with Monroe's lead singer and decides to use inside knowledge gained as her female friend to woo her, while Lemmon's character - who often struggles to refrain from getting too 'excited', shall we say - has to contend with an old millionaire who has fallen in love with him. Contrary to what you may expect, the movie isn't all that problematic. It has aged rather well, with its humour almost constantly being good-natured and with its messages actually being somewhat progressive. For the most part, the piece plays out as a farce. It has moments of drama and moments of romance but comedy is its major focus. Occasionally, it's quite funny. It's also typically rather entertaining. It isn't massively compelling, though, and it starts to sag a bit in its mid-section. This overall lack of engagement brings the thing's highlights down somewhat. Still, it's a good effort. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

An extraordinary and very funny comedy,"I do not remember how many times I have seen this comedy and each time I enjoy it. When I want to sit looking at a good film, ""Some like it hot"" is a very good option. This comedy had real ingredients of the period of dry law in US, which gave a nice and reasonable plot. Marilyn Monroe and Tony Curtis were great, simply one of the best looking couple of the former cinema. George Raft acted in the role of gangster. I do not think that this role was difficult for Raft, someone that during the 50s was always working in nightclubs and casinos in Havana linked to the foreign and internal maffia at that time, so it was easy to him to do what he used to do in his real life. Pat O'Brien acted not as a priest as usual but as a good inspector-detective. But better than all this was the acting of Jack Lemmon and Joe E. Brown (whom we used to call ""Big mouth"" or ""Bocasa"" in Spanish), both gave the necessary ingredients to make this comedy one of the greatest of all time. The film is good from the beginning until the end, but certain scenes were simply the funniest, one of them when Curtis and Lemmon were having a chat with the nearly naked ladies in the train at night, the other one when Marilyn met Curtis in the yacht and Curtis showed falsely no feeling for kisses of Marilyn, but again the best came at the end when Lemmon told Brown that he was a man and Brown told him that it does not matter because nobody is perfect.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Jerry: ""I'm engaged!"" Joe: ""Congratulations, who's the lucky girl?"" Jerry: ""I am!""","Some Like It Hot (1959) is an Oscar-winning comedy directed by Billy Wilder presenting the story of two male musicians posing as females in an all-girl band in an extraordinary effort to evade the mafia, who have the duo on their hit list after they were witnesses to their St. Valentine's Day Massacre.And it's even funnier than it sounds. There were so many laugh out loud moments placed abundantly throughout the film and when it eventually slips into a more serious tone, it feels so natural. The change in mood was so seamless that I didn't even consciously realise the moment that it transitioned! And don't think for a second that the profuse hilariousness of this picture comes at a sacrifice to the plot, as the story is completely unpredictable (especially that ending!), and that actually aids the amusement of this feature. Plus, it somehow manages to explore themes such as gender, sexuality, femininity, and even perversion, all in a 1950s comedy! It took me by immense surprise to see such a revolutionary & progressive film coming from such a conservative era. But regardless, this film wouldn't be what it is if it wasn't for the tremendously outstanding performances of Tony Curtis (as Joe/Josephine) and Jack Lemmon (as Jerry/Daphne). It genuinely shocks me that the former was *not* in the run-in for an Oscar (unlike his co-star), as they were almost equally as exceptional as each other. I say almost simply because Lemmon had that slight edge to him, and that was mainly thanks to the extremely wide range of emotions that his character goes through, and as a result, we got to see his acting prowess on show in all sorts of extravagantly various ways. Finally, I'd just like to mention the very thing that this movie won an Academy Award for: the costume design. This, together with the hair & make-up, was nothing short of excellent. The eye-catching outfits that these two impostors have to wear just add to the already surplus comicality of the whole situation.So in conclusion, a remarkable comedy that is guaranteed to leave you in hysterics. 100% recommend to anyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

"Not the funniest film ever made, but essential viewing","The first time I saw ""Some Like it Hot"" as a teenager I didn't really like it very much. It was one of my father's favorite films but after he watched it again with me even he claimed he found it to be quite disappointing, and that he had ""remembered it being funnier."" I know the whole genre-swapping thing was risqué in 1959 and I appreciate the layers of the film - all the sexual references (such as Tony Curtis' pointed foot during his scene with Marilyn Monroe as a pretty obvious sight gag) and other stuff that goes on. However I couldn't help but find my overall reaction somewhat mixed. Viewing it again a few years later I found it to be a bit more enjoyable, but I still would not call it the greatest comedy of all-time.In my opinion Wilder's other collaboration with Jack Lemmon, a similarly ahead-of-its time and racy film called ""The Apartment"" (released a year later), is superior to ""Some Like It Hot."" But this one seems to receive even more critical attention than Wilder and Lemmon's other film and I believe it was voted by the AFI as the second funniest film of all time (with ""Tootsie"" at number one).The performances cannot be faulted. Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are both very good and Curtis' classic Cary Grant impersonation has become something of a film legend. Monroe isn't the best actress in the world (and it's certainly not as good a performance as she gave in ""The Misfits"" a couple years later) but she's basically there to look pretty and be bubbly, and that works well.Overall I'd say this comedy works rather well for the first forty minutes, but like many body-swapping comedies of today, once the ideas run out it kind of gets old fast. The Cary Grant impersonation and Lemmon's hilarious (and rather disturbing) romance with a rich man whilst dressed up as a woman both add a bit of flair to the plot, but in the end I'd say I find it to be more fondly remembered than it perhaps deserves to be - but that's just me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"A belly full of laughs, vintage entertainment!","Well, dear fellow film lovers: If you ain't seen this one you ain't seen nuttin'! A few years ago, ""Some like it hot"" was rated the greatest comedy ever made and though I do not much care for -- or believe in -- such ratings the fact is that I was readily in agreement with this one and I continue to think so.It is a film full of verve, sharp dialog, stinging one-liners, quick pace, imaginative chase sequences, and possibly the quickest-witted ending answer in the history of the cinema: Nobody's perfect! Yep, too true, nobody is perfect - but in this movie director Billy Wilder came as close to the Holy Grail of a perfectly directed movie as I can remember: Marilyn was at her most sensual and in the best acting form I ever saw from her; Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, Joe E. Brown and George Raft peerless; and the supporting cast of Nehemiah Persoff, George E. Stone, and many others was marvellous. Absolutely no weaknesses in the acting that I could detect.Finally, a word about the outstanding photography in the ""film noir"" tradition yet never interferes with the smooth narrative.What a movie!

"Funny, yes.  But ""funniest""?  No way.","One other reviewer wrote: ""Lemmon's Daphne is one of the most incredible and masterful acting jobs in the history of cinema."" Such hyperbole pretty much says it all about this film. It's a wacky zany comedy. It's well written, so a good percentage of the jokes hit. Furthermore, the reviewers who noted that the film stands the test of time pretty well have got that right. It's still funny today.However, so are the Three Stooges.At the end of the day, this is a very good comedy. But, those who give it some sort of special or iconic status are doubtlessly seeing things through some Marilyn or other golden age colored glasses. The acting is not that much better than many other period films nor is the subject matter particularly differentiating (despite numerous claims otherwise in various other reviews, the guys-dressing-as-girls-and-getting-laughs idea was pretty well worn even by the late 50s.) Rather, good writing carries the day and makes it a great movie for a rainy Saturday afternoon.And nothing more.",1.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"color cinema already existed. It is a combination of screwball comedy, romantic comedy, thriller and gangster.","""Some Like It Hot""It is a very interesting movie considering that it was made in 1959 in black and white, when color cinema already existed. It is a combination of screwball comedy, romantic comedy, thriller and gangster. With great music and an ingenious screen writing by Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond. The director is also Billy Wilder.The movie is set in 1929, during the time of the Prohibition. It starts when two Chicago musicians Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry(Jack Lemmon) have to run from the police. In the middle of the little chaos, the same luck brings them to witness a murder on Valentine's Day. Making them two wanted men by Chicago's mafia. While they are looking for a job, they find a vacant on a girl band group for saxophone and bass players, respectively the instruments they both play. In the desperation, they disguise as women and join the band. They name themselves Josephine (Joe) and Daphne (Jerry). While in the girl band, Joe falls in love with Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) and an old millionaire man, Osgood Fielding (Joe E Brown), falls in love with Daphne. Making it funnier because Osgood does not know that Daphne is a guy.All of the main actors did an excellent performance, considering that it is seen as one of the greatest comedy films of all time. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are both dramatic and funny, which engages the audience with both of them. On the other hand, Marilyn Monroe is probably the most complex character. She acts as a more ""elegantly vulgar"" character and female drinker. She portrays the woman dependent of a man. And many have criticized the scene when she appears singing 'I Wanna Be Loved By You' with a nude color dress, and the lighting focused on a way that she appears to be naked.I loved the scene when Joe is sitting on the bench while the girls are in the beach because it gives the plot a major turn around, creating a third character portrayed by Joe. And it complicates everything more. The fact of a lie on top of another lie and other lies, which give the audience a sense of suspense about how will it turn out. One scene that I did not specifically loved was when there is a second murderer because it looks a bit unrealistic and it is the same thing occurring all over again. An unrealistically bad luck.This movie was considered extremely controversial and was even banned in certain places like Kansas. The fact of Joe and Jerry transforming themselves into Josephine and Daphne creates a sexual confusion on the very conservative time period that the movie was made. As the director Curtis Hanson said about the movie: ""It's a film about sex – from the title to the final line. It's not just about sex as in people having sex; it's also about sexual attitudes, sexual roles and, of course, sexual identity."" The relationship of Osgood and Daphne was probably the most criticized one because it becomes bigger and bigger at the point of them being engaged and when Joe asks Jerry ""Who's the lucky girl?"", Jerry answers ""Me!."" This gave a sense of confusion because the character could not realize why could not he marry Osgood. Finally, when he confesses to Osgood ""I am a guy!"", this one replies ""Nobody's perfect."" Which leaves the audience with a sense of confusion and trying to convey an idea of sexual identity. But overall, it was a very good movie with beautiful scenery and an unusual plot. It is considered one of the funniest movies of all time, and even though it was a bit controversial when it came out, it is nothing that you would not see in movies nowadays.This movie has been considered to be a screwball comedy, which is a type of comedy that "" distinguishes itself for being characterized by a female that dominates the relationship with the male central character, whose masculinity is challenged."" It is also a romantic comedy, where we can see the romances of Sugar and Joe, and Osgood and Daphne being a major part of the plot. A thriller, where we do not know what will happen and if someone will ever find out that they are guys. It leaves the audience waiting for the climax. Finally, it is also considered a gangster film, where it is a crime-dealing movie and the Chicago mafia is trying to capture Joe and Jerry. The movie won an Oscar for costume design in black and white and the music is also very nice. The song ""I Wanna Be Loved By You"" had its most famous performance by Marilyn Monroe in this movie.I would give this movie a 4.3/5This review was written by a high school sophomore, who likes to listen to music and watch movies. It was written for a film appreciation class.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A treat to the eyes. Unforgettable,"Do colours matter? I doubt so.
When there is Marilyn Monroe in front of you. Hell no ! I don't care about the colours. That white brown shade of her body eclipses the icy white and sun-tanned shades of modern beauties.
The movies was some 2 hrs long and I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen even for a moment, and when Monroe arrived in any scene, hell not.
Her voice as sweet as a child's and the beauty shamming one of the most beautiful women I have seen ever, she is the perfect epitome of fantasy and desire, making even the strongest go weak in their knees.
Though beneath her ever-smiling face and eternal beauty lied some very troublesome facets of her life, atleast wikipedia says that, though it's hard to believe. This takes me to one realisation as well that ""Life is not always what meets the eye"".How can someone so tense, anxious and dissatisfied inside play such a happy calm composure on screen, and that too to such a perfection, fooling even the wisest men, atleast I think so, like me. If that is not the acting then what is. Tabloids and magazines may generalize her as a sex symbol and a dumb blonde but how fluently and easily she acted the real life opposite roles, makes me admire her, both her acting and her beauty.
Now back to movie; I think there is no going back to coz it was alll about Monroe and nothing else. Tony and Jack did one of the best comedies but that too fades in front of her.
The movie was all about Marilyn Monroe and was as amazing and ravishing as her.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
An Archetype... That's Pretty Great,"""Some Like It Hot"" is hard to explain. The film, if you've never seen it, is going to feel like something you've seen a hundred times before. And you probably have, but they did it first. To be successful, two guys dress up as women, and then one falls for a woman (Marilyn Monroe) -- so how does he tell her without her hating him for keeping the secret?We have seen plenty of films where guys get close to women because of some trick -- usually innocently -- and then have to inevitably reveal the truth. And sometimes this involves cross-dressing. I think it's safe to say that ""Some Like it Hot"" was the first film to play this plot, especially with the cross-dressing.This film is funny, to be sure, and has a very nice innocence to it in that it seems pretty obvious to the audience that the women are men. The broad shoulders, the weird bumps while wearing a swimsuit? How the girls don't catch on is beyond me. And then to not recognize the guys while in male clothing... wow.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Plenty of laughs involved.

Wilder spoofs and hits the right notes.,"This is to me quintessential Billy Wilder, spoofing the gangster genre and cheekily bending the genders in a joyous romp that is standing the test of time in this perceived new age of movie watchers. The cries of it being a one joke movie don't carry weight because the final result is two hours of tongue in cheek winking entertainment that shatters that particular charge.The cast here are uniformly excellent, Jack Lemmon & Tony Curtis bounce of each other in a sort of lowest denominator camp extreme that makes for mirth in abundance, and Monroe may just give the greatest spoof {of herself} performance in cinema history as she plays up perfectly to her image so played out in the press of the time. George Raft throws his lot in with a delightful caricature show, whilst Joe E Brown almost steals the film as Osgood, in fact he gets the icing on the cake final line that is now considered right at the top of the tree for closing lines.The off screen troubles with Monroe are some source of reference, and it really isn't my wish to waffle about stories that are available to you at a click of your mouse, what we know is that Wilder with the help of I.A.L.

How a Chance Meeting at Delmonico's Secured a Film Classic,"Of course, of course _ ""Some Like it Hot"" is arguably the greatest screwball comedy in the history of Hollywood. But, as they say, the devil is in the details. One of those details _ casting _ could have instantly derailed this classic. Who to dress up in drag with Tony Curtis, run from the mob led by George Raft and hook up with Marilyn Monroe at her most sensuous? Oh, and to field a marriage proposal from Joe E. Brown despite a, uh, gender issue? And by the way, what actor to play over the top without taking his own brilliance too seriously and ruining the whole shebang for everybody? On the 25th anniversary of the film, I acted as host-interviewer of ""An Evening with Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond"" and got a rare peek behind the scenes and an up-close look at both Wilder and Jack Lemmon, the actor who met the aforementioned requirements perfectly. I hope you find the following story amusing. Among other things, it illustrates that, no matter how high the budget and how big the stars, film is still an art form and chemistry matters, and that chemistry is very often predicated on serendipity and just plain luck.)IN Hollywood, they say it's not what you know, but who you know. They might have added, it's also who you know if you run into each other at a serendipitous time.I acted as host-interviewer for ""An Evening with Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond"" on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of ""Some Like It Hot.""Great stories.Wilder lived up to his reputation as one of Hollywood's great wits and raconteurs. A dervish behind thick Coke-bottle glasses chomping on an ever-present cigar stub, he was at once elegant and raw, a man who had fled the Nazis, pulled himself up by the bootstraps through talent and guile, and beaten Hollywood at its own game.Jack Lemmon was just a nice guy. REALLY. The quintessential Hollywood Everyman, even nicer and more accommodating off-screen than on, which was saying a bunch.He and Wilder would have one of the industry's great collaborative friendships. But not just yet. And this is how it started.Lemmon told me he did not know Wilder well when, as luck would have it, he happened to be dining with his future wife, Felicia Farr, at Delmonico's restaurant one early Sunday evening at the same time as Wilder. The great director spied him and dropped by his table later on the way out.Wilder, as was his way, came right to the point.""Gunna do dis story where you'd dress up in drag and run avay vit a girls' band after seeing the St. Valentine's Day Massacre _ vonna do it?"" he asked the startled actor (and who played startled better than Lemmon?).Recalled Lemmon while sitting in his office (his Oscar for 1972's ""Save the Tiger"" gleaming on a shelf behind him): ""In that one sentence, I had the whole story. For the first time, I took a role without having seen the script.""And we all know the result.Oh well, nobody's perfect.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
The greatest comedy?,"It is, of course, wonderful. The narrative is impeccable. The acting by all principals is magical. Without being flashy, the mise en scène is precise and clear. The dialogue is crisp and funny. And it has been voted the greatest comedy film of all time...But is it? Thank you Billy for this wonderful film, but I really don't think it holds a candle to some of the great works of Chaplin or Keaton. It is not as funny as the finest works of the Marx Bros.No, not the greatest comedy, but perhaps, yes, perhaps the most entertaining comedy of the cinema. It is the kind of film where you inwardly give a little squeal of pleasure as each unlikely twist of the plot falls into place. When Jerry refers to men as 'dirty beasts' it sends a shiver of pleasure down the spine with utter certainty. This is situation comedy that makes 'Friends' look like Mother Courage. The real art in this farce-like structure is to keep all of the complications bubbling along and Wilder & Diamond do this just about perfectly.So now I feel mean-spirited for not praising this lovely film more fulsomely. It's just that Keaton, and, even more so, Chaplin knew that comedy was serious stuff. Some Like It Hot isn't serious, just seriously and gleefully entertaining.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Lucky for us Billy Wilder offered the role of Sugar Kane to MM in this UA film.

Truly.Great sets, and atmosphere and great songs by Marilyn Monroe add to the merriment and of course Joe E Brown's immortal performance make this a great film.

Marylyn Monroe's Best Movie,"Monroe was the reigning blond bombshell when she made this movie. For all of her problems and the complaints about her from the critics, could anyone else have played this role as she did. Forget how many times it took her to get it the way Billy Wilder wanted it. 50 years later, we can watch her and not wonder why she caught the attention of the countries men, including America's best playwrite, Joe Dimagio, and a Senator from Mass. She was good in the Seven Year Itch and the Misfits, so critics can't say she only had one great movie. But this is my favorite because she is cute, funny and somehow sexy and innocent at the same time. I have a feeling that's the way she really was in life. She couldn't help that she had that great skin and sex appeal. Would this movie be on nearly everyone's favorite 100 movies without her? Curtis and Lemmon are great, along with the supporting actors - Joe E Brown (Nobody's Perfect Line one of the all time great quotes.

"Where did you get that phony accent? Nobody ""talks loike thet!""Some Like It Hot","I was finally able to catch up with what many people call the funniest movie ever made, Some Like It Hot. This is now the first and only film I have seen with Marilyn Monroe as well as directed by Billy Wilder. The hype on these two seem to be correct and I look forward to checking out more from both. However, the real success of the film is the portrayal of our two leads by Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis. Both bring a fantastic comedic element to the story and play their roles to perfection. So many films afterwards have taken the general plot linetwo people see a gang shooting and run away/change identities to not get killed only to end up running into the mobsters coincidentally in the city they have relocated to, and remade it. None of them come close to the level of achievement that this one has, way back in 1959.Right from the get-go, seeing the thug/big-nosed Italians hiding in the back of a hearse in order to smuggle whiskey during Prohibition, we know exactly what we are in for. Wilder allows the story to play out on both a dramatic and comedic level, never straying too far into one to let the other fall away. Sure there are some laughs at the start, especially between Lemmon and Curtis in the funeral bar and a couple moments poking fun at the ""coffee"" code language, but only after the two go on the lam as women instrument players in Florida do the big laughs come. The two men are just so manly that looking at them in drag brings a smile to your face, let alone when they actually talk. Lemmon is brilliant as Daphne, the loquacious girl that likes to talk too much and have fun, slowly getting so good at being a female he starts to believe he is one. ""Just keep telling yourself you're a boy."" As for Curtis, he shines as three separate roles. He must be believable as the gambling, womanizing, sax player Joe; the millionaire, yacht-owning Shell Oil tycoon; and the best friend, Conservatory-trained musician Josephine. Each character is created and used to enhance all the others as he tries to con Marilyn Monroe's Sugar into falling in love with him.Monroe plays the flighty blonde to great success. She continually calls herself dumb and the words that come out of her mouth, as well as the believing of all the drivel that comes from Curtis' tycoon (some real funny lines), prove that fact. Being that I had always heard she wasn't too bad an actress, I wasn't quite sure what to expect since my impression of her was more model used to sell seats, not any skill at the craft. While she is definitely radiantly beautiful here, I have to believe she isn't just being the pretty face. Yes, she gets top-billing, but although she isn't in the movie for that much compared to her co-stars, she does well with the time she is given. I'm not sure how successful the movie would have been without her to have the boys play off of. The glowing smile and sex appeal are one thing, but her scene of depression upon being dumped shows a vulnerability and strength through tears, yet keeping a calm, collected voice, show that maybe there really was something there.Where the film really works is with the situations brought about by the duality of our leads. Their fighting with themselves and each other, sometimes forgetting what sex they are at the moment, let alone truly are, is priceless. Lemmon's fast-talking naïveté gets him to bring the biggest laughs, thanks in part to a wonderful supporting role from Joe E. Brown as Osgood Fielding III, but Curtis is right there behind him. His machismo, used to put Lemmon in line, contrasted to his gentility, when with Monroe, is spot-on, as is the accent of affluence used to win her heart. Credit goes to Wilder for one of the best scenes from the film involving all four characters. The transitional cuts between Curtis and Monroe, attempting to let him feel love again, with Fielding and Lemmon, cutting up the tango dance floor, are absolutely hilarious. The juxtaposition of Daphne's tall, muscular frameat times leading the dancewith the small, thin, elderly Brown can't be viewed without some amount of giggling.It may not be the funniest film I have ever seen, but I can totally see where people are coming from when making that statement. Released just before the 1960's, this film can be seen as incredibly influential to the comedy genre and cinema in general. One-liners are present throughout and the acting is professionally handled at all times, bringing the laughs, but also staying grounded for those moments of seriousness when relationships are failing and death seems awfully close at hand. I hope to catch up with more work from all four principals here, to view some movies of an era I am not very proficient in, and to hopefully enjoy myself as much as I did here.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Beautiful Marilyn Monroe...,"""Some Like It Hot"" is a comedy movie in which we watch two men who disguised as women in order get away from mafia because they were witnesses of a hit of this mafia.

"Timeless, sublime character-driven comedy","Voted the funniest American comedy ever made, Some Like It Hot is a film that has aced the test of time. This feat is made somehow even more impressive when one reflects on the retro elements the film draws on. There is a slice of '30s gangster pictures, a large wedge of '30s/'40s screwball comedy and the entire film is set during the 1920s prohibition era. Yet, despite the historical influences, the film feels eerily modern. Made, although not approved, during the highly-restrictive ""Hays Code era"", we are treated to cross-dressing lead males and an often scantily-clad Marilyn Monroe alongside jokes and allusions which demonstrate an acceptance, maturity and knowingness that seem far ahead of the prevailing mores of the era.Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon play Joe and Jerry, two musicians in Chicago who are living hand-to-mouth and find themselves owing money to virtually everyone with whom they've had professional or social contact. The situation gets worse when the speakeasy they are playing at becomes obsolete after a law enforcement crackdown. With no jobs or any prospects of getting out of debt, one would think the pairs' misfortune could be compounded no further. This turns out not to be the case as they find themselves inadvertently bearing witness to a mass mob shooting. Narrowly escaping but now in mortal danger, they hit upon a rather hare-brained scheme: they will disguise themselves as women in order to join an all-girl jazz band that is leaving for Florida that very night. Thus Joe and Jerry will become Josephine and Geraldine, no make that Josephine and Daphne (Jerry never really liked the name Geraldine anyway). If this plan works out, the pair can escape the mob, earn some money and be free of their debts once and for all. The entire concept is ridiculous, audacious and utterly outrageous, so get in and get set for a thrill-ride because that is just the very point.As with all great comedies, you have to start with the script. The dialogue is crackling in its wit and inventiveness. This is evident right from the first scene in which a number of delicious linguistic allusions are interwoven. An undercover policeman infiltrates an illegal bar constructed within a funeral parlour and the cop has to announce himself as a pall bearer in order to enter. He is not able to get one of the best seats, however, as these are reserved for those who were ""close members of the family"", read: the mob. The cop is also rebuffed when he asks for booze as the establishment only serves coffee: scotch coffee, Canadian coffee or sour mash coffee, that is. This sort of repartee continues when we are introduced to the two male leads and ramps up during their exploits as disguised women. A particularly amusing example occurs while Jerry/Daphne is teasing the prospect of revealing his secret to Marilyn Monroe's Sugar Kane, she offers him a drink and says, ""That'll put hairs on your chest."", ""No fair guessing."" Comes Daphne's reply.The script doesn't just fire in terms of dialogue, the overall set-up plays out wonderfully too. There are a large number of moving parts which somehow blend quite joyously together with all of them centring around Joe and Jerry. Both men are fish out of water as they try to blend in as women in their supposedly all-female band, the threat of detection being an ever-present concern. Then there's the need to stay one step ahead of the mob, who want Joe and Jerry out of the way. To make matters even more complicated, both men develop love interests: Joe finds himself infatuated with the beautiful Sugar Kane and so, to woo her, enters into a second-level disguise as a reclusive millionaire looking for someone to mend his wounded heart. While ""Daphne"" engenders the unwanted affections of the blithely eccentric and actual millionaire Osgood Fielding III (played by Joe E Brown). As a result of all this, there is constant tension and the film moves at a rapid-fire pace. And yet, somehow, there is room for genuine moments of calm in which characters are developed and sympathies are established. Despite being recognised for its comedic prowess, the film is not pure comedy as there is genuine pathos and elements of drama. Sugar Kane is wounded and betrayed but keeps on making the same mistakes. Joe is manipulative and dishonest and yet the script finds room for him to show a modicum of repentance for his behaviour. Jerry and Osgood, on the other hand, seem to be matched together for the comedic value provided but, low-and-behold, even in their relationship lies a depth which is only discovered in what has to be the greatest final line in the history of cinema. In short, if ever there were a defining example of what a perfect screenplay should look like then this is it.So many words and I still have not focused on the performances, without the brilliance of which the film would not have worked at all. Curtis and Lemmon put in seminal turns as Jo, Jerry, Jospehine, Geraldine, Daphne, and Shell Oil Junior. Their mannerisms, accents and comedic timing are all sublime and, thus, an utter joy to watch. Curtis' take on Cary Grant's vocal inflections while playing his make-believe millionaire make for particularly amusing viewing and the role-reversing inter-cutting scene in which Marilyn Monroe is seducing Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon and Joe E Brown are taking turns in leading during a tango is both played and directed to perfection.And so, finally, to the master-mind behind it all: Billy Wilder. He is possibly the most unsung great director that Hollywood ever produced. Wilder's direction provides a frantic energy but it also gives plenty of time and space to allow the story to blossom. In what is such a ludicrous set-up, it would be easy for this film to operate as an exploitative piece of nonsense comedy. Instead it is both a thrill-ride and yet tender, humane and touching. It makes full value of the comedy of two brilliantly talented male actors posing as women without ever making cross-dressing or alternative lifestyles the butt of the joke. Wilder makes sure that it's the characters who take centre-stage, and the characters are essentially confused, vulnerable, weak-willed and utterly imperfect, yet quite loveable and very much relatable as a result. That Wilder is able to achieve so much in just one picture is what, I believe, has led to this film maintaining its relevance for so long. Sixty-three years and counting, if films ought to be judged on their ability to withstand time's test, then it is right that this film should be honoured with the highest accolade it is possible to bestow.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Marilyn Monroe, QUEEN of Hollywood","When I saw this movie on the Top 250 list I did not want to see it. I thought it would just be a boring movie, black and white, nothing special.Oh God, how wrong I was.This movie has just everything, a great story that never gets boring, perfect humor, incredible music and of course the Queen herself the one and only Marilyn Monroe.I never saw a movie with her in my whole life, I knew she is one of Hollywoods famost actors but I did not know how beautiful she really is. I mean, wow, just perfect. It's a disaster she died so young.

I'm a big fan of Billy Wilder but I hate this movie,"Double indemnity, sunset boulevard, the apartment and Witness for the prosecution are all in my top 50 favorite movies of all time. So I went into this film with great expectations but I was very much disappointed. The plot sounds very exciting but something went wrong somewhere. Instead of laughing, I was bored out of my mind and at the end of the day the jokes and humor of the movie felt forced and unfunny. The acting was mer and I don't find Marilyn Monroe attractive.",3.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Cutting Edge, 1959","No need to recap the plot nor echo consensus points.The movie is perfectly cast. The chemistry between Lemmon and Curtis is perfect. Add a wide-eyed Monroe and it's an outstanding comedy trifecta. Still, seeing the film again after first release, I wonder how much hilarity audiences of today find in the movie's sexual innuendo. After all, the premise was cutting-edge in 1959 when the word 'panties' in Anatomy of a Murder raised a ruckus with enforcers of the film code.In that same year, just watching from a theatre seat during the cross-dressing, plus the many innuendo scenes was like being a daring part of taboo-breaking. The bawdy subtext was a totally new experience in the commercial movies. Thus the amusement factor was heightened by novel comedic material, previously forbidden. But I wonder about today's younger audiences for whom the innuendo may even seem a little tame, given today's almost non-existent standards.In my little book, it's still a funny movie, thanks mainly to an expert cast, but hardly an all- time topper as it is in some ratings lists. Besides, it's the only comedy I can think of to work its way around not just one, but two, on-screen massacres!",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
The perfect cinematic experience,"This is one of the funniest movies ever made, and I can't believe anyone wouldn't enjoy it.

Some Like It Hot,"Still one of the funniest films ever made. Lemmon and Curtis are a perfect match as musicians on the run as witnesses to the St. Valentine's Day Massacre...dressing up as women. I love the story about how both stars tested their ""get up"" out by going into the ladies room in their costumes. Both stars have said that no one even questioned it. That's how perfect they looked. Monroe, when she knew her lines, is quirky and delightful as Sugar. Wilder and Diamond present the first of two consecutive great works on their hands here. This classic was followed by ""The Apartment,"" which also starred Lemmon. This film was made into a musical in the 1970's with Tony Roberts and Robert Morse. The musical was titled ""Sugar.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
As Mentioned in 'My Week with Marilyn'.,"Having just enjoyed last year's 'My Week with Marilyn', where Michelle Williams plays Marilyn Monroe, the epilogue says that Some Like It Hot was her next film and how it was a huge hit.After the semi-scandalous shenanigans that occurred during the filming of that crazy, doomed film in question - The Prince and the Showgirl, it indeed would be very fitting to re-watch (the sixth, or seventh time?) this bubbly frothy classic, that actually starts out as a Prohibition- set gangster movie.Few films manage to instill one with excitable anticipation at a seventh viewing but this Billy Wilder scripted/directed one still does. It's more than mere comedy, it has literally everything with a perfect cast playing, well, perfectly, with Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in drag (to fool the gangsters after witnessing a shooting) one of the most enduring double acts of all time. And, of course, the real shame is that Marilyn wasn't able to treat us to more of this sort that she plays so naturally - she really does shines and fizzes effervescently.It's indeed, the subtle but clever innuendo that is the icing on the cake - we don't need to be shown any more or hear anything stronger to know exactly what is going on. This helps makes it so timeless.Many know and love the film and cite it as one of their all-time favourites - it's to them that I say, sometimes you need the merest of an excuse to indulge, as you would with some special chocolates or fancy bottle of wine. Some Like It Hot is the perfect antidote to dark, wet and stormy afternoons, is non-fattening and actually very good for you, as laughter is indeed, the best medicine. It remains an essential DVD for every collection - sometimes only the best comedy will do!",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

About SO much more than the gender-terrorists will have it.,"'Some Like it Hot', that ultimate paean to life in all its protean subversiveness, begins with death.  A funeral to be precise.  Of course, it's not a real funeral - a gang of grimly gormless bootleggers are smuggling illegal liquour in a casket, Death mocked by whiskey, the water of life.  This gives a socially disruptive comedy a metaphysical depth not always present in Wilder.Because, for all the farcical high jinx, there is real death in this film, which is a true gangster film, not a spoof.  No matter how many times I see this film, it never ceases to shock me, in the garage massacre scene, that Jerry and Joe are a dying man's last jerk away from being mown to pieces like yesterday's grass.  Why not, we've just seen it happen, and such 'innocent' murders were commonplace at the time. It's ironic, then, that a film driven by self-preservation should result in the discovery of different selves.  This is why Spats and cronies must die - they are tied down, by genre, by history, by period, by identity - Spats is literally what he wears.  Joe and Jerry survive by transforming, from one genre to another, gangster to comedy, from one part of the country to another, from one gender to another.  'Hot' is another of Wilder's modern fairy tales, and transformation is a necessary component of any good fairy tale.That opening sequence is still breathtaking - the police shootout where people actually die; the solemn funeral 'front'; the arrangements for the police sting.  When Mulligan moves from the quiet of the funeral home to the Jazz Age vibrancy of the speakeasy, it's like he's magically entered another realm, shown by the very Wilder mirror that reflects the fun.  Even before Joe and Jerry enter, the film is rife with disguise, deceit, division, reflection, transformation.  This is 'Hot''s real subversion - Joe and Jerry aren't disruptive imps, changing the world in their own image; they are playing the world by its own rules, its own self-delusion.  After all, the film isn't set in 1929 for nothing, and the monumental shadow of the Crash looms over every scene, every musical-comedy cliche of the millionaire.The 1920s, the Jazz Age, Prohibition, gangsters - all this is one big aberration in American history, a subversion of what it conservatively means to be an American, where hedonism, a weirdly social self-interest reigns, where respectable people are forced by law to become criminal just to have a lousy, lethal drink.  This isn't just a subversive comedy about gender and identity - after all, dressing up as a woman isn't quite the same as menstruating or having babies - this is a two-fingers to Eisenhower's vision of America, where people have to pretend to be what they are not (conformist, all-American, nuclear-family etc.) so as not to stick out and be lynched.Do I really need to say that this is hilarious (although there are longueurs, some lines don't take off, and the film itself doesn't really zing until we reach Florida - maybe I've seen it too often), that Marilyn Monroe for once is a beautiful and sexy woman, rather than a caricature of one, that I know every scene and line by heart?  What's most interesting is that while Joe is the most convincing woman in the film (best scene in the movie - Josephine kissing Sugar near the end), it is Jerry, the most aggressively male to begin with, who ends up wishing he were a girl.  Do people really think through the consequences of this film, that if there is a wedding night, Osgood and Daphne...",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Just simply perfect comedy,"Two musicians--Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon)--accidentally witness a gangland murder set up by Spats Colombo (George Raft). They disguise themselves as women (Joe becomes Josephine and Jerry becomes Daphne) and join an all girls band traveling to Florida. Also in the band is Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) and both the men fall madly in love with her.Classic comedy. I've seen it at least 10 times and I laugh out loud at it each time. It's fast-moving with a hilarious script. When I first saw this I was afraid there would be gay jokes made at the expense of Curtis and Lemmon. There isn't one! The script beautifully side steps any offensive material. Even when Curtis asks Lemmon, ""Why would a guy want to marry another guy"" Lemmon says, ""Security!"" The acting is mostly great. Curtis and Lemmon are just perfect and play off each other very well. Curtis actually looks pretty attractive as a woman! Monroe is just OK. She hated making this movie--she kept flubbing her lines and looks overweight (especially during her big musical number). Raft is pretty lousy--very stone-faced. But he's barely in the movie so it doesn't hurt things. It's filmed in black and white which actually helps--I think Lemmon and Curtis would have looked pretty awful in color as girls. So--a classic comedy with plenty of laughs and a famous last line--""Nobody's perfect"". Well worth seeing again and again. I give this a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Cute!,"A great classic movie! Marilyn is a legend, so talented!",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
great fun,"Set in 1929, prohibition and alcohol is definitely one of many undertones to this film. Two men, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are musicians with very bad luck and who can't seem to make ends meet. In the middle of winter in New York City the two men witness a mob whacking and now have criminals chasing after them. Their luck seems to change when they pose as women to play in an all girl band headed for Florida. As they meet their train for the job, they are dressed as women, and you can't help to think `those are two ugly chicks'. This film being made in the 1950's, is about cross dressers and a little hint of homosexuality, with Marilyn Monroe seducing her audience with her good looks, its hard to believe that people would stomach this film as a family movie while Leave it to Beaver is playing on the television at home.Some like it hot ironically portrays Monroe's real life where alcohol is her first and only resort, and her trouble with men and love. Her role is the stupid blonde that can't really think or do for herself, and that women are just gold diggers. Even though her role is stereotypical she is a very convincing actress.Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are great actors and a great pair for this film. Totally hilarious is an understatement as two men posed as women are fighting for affection of the same girl. The scene where they break their feminine characters are great.The music is great from hot Jazz to smooth classical, the right music is in the right scene at just the right time, which adds to the emotion of the characters.There is also some great action scenes in some like it hot. The most impressive is in the beginning as the cops are chasing a car full of mobsters, gunfire and car crashes fill the screen. Even though it's a 50's film it was just as effective as today.Some like it hot is a great family film, in which you will have fun just watching it. This film is highly recommended and a great piece to add to your home video library.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Arguably the Best Comedy Ever Produced.,"Everything a comedy is supposed to be is shown in ""Some Like It Hot"", quite possibly Billy Wilder's (Oscar-nominated in writing and directing) finest production. Two musicians (Oscar-nominated Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis) witness a mob hit and flee the state. They pose as two musicians in an all-girls band to hide out. Naturally this means that the two must disguise themselves as ladies to make their wild plan work. The typical insanity ensues as Marilyn Monroe is along for the ride as one of the sexy band members.

This Is As Hot As ......We Need It......(Brilliant),"The great Billy Wilder directs, writes, and has a say in the screenplay of one of the really great comedies. Some Like It Hot is up there in the best five comedies...ever made. Marilyn Munroe, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are superb as the three leads in this risqué 1959 steam-roller. Wilder did everything to get up the noses of the censors, and was clever enough to get away with all of it. In 1959 men dressing and behaving like ladies...wearing ladies clothes...was dangerous ground to tread on. And the many sub-plots that this brought about were also ""no go"" areas. He succeeded just like the T.V. Classic Seinfeld...when they declared ""not that there's anything wrong with that"" when they did there great ""sexual preference"" episode. In the case of Some Like It Hot...we need to remember...this was 1959. Munroe was always difficult to work with...continually turning up late, and being obviously neurotic. In a famous B.B.C. talk show in the 1970s Curtis described Munroe as a ""fruit cake"". I am sure that was true, but she was wonderful in Some Like It Hot. The movie is a classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
One of the best comedies off all time.,"I recently picked up a special edition DVD of the classic ""Some Like It Hot"", and upon arriving home with it, tossed out my old battered fullscreen VHS version. I watched this film again last night, with the added bonus of seeing it for the first time in widescreen, and was immediately struck once again by how perfect a movie it is.You've got a Billy Wilder film with female impersonators in it, in the forms of Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, and Marilyn Monroe with a screen name that reeks of porn and/or strippers - ""Sugar Cane"". What more could you ask for? This wondrous mix combined to make one of the greatest comedies in the history of film.Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon portray down-and-out musicians who accidentally witness a mob massacre and immediately flee from the mob as George Raft's character says, ""I don't like no loose ends."" In desperation, they disguise themselves as women - Curtis as ""Josephine"", and Lemmon as ""Daphne"", in order to join an all-girl band and leave town.Once ""Sugar Cane"" (Monroe) sashays past the pair on the way to the train they're about to board, all bets are off. Staring after her as she walks away, Lemmon, as ""Daphne"" exclaims, ""Would you look at that...That's just like jello on springs!"" The rest of the plot summary I'll leave out. What I will remark on is how really filthy this movie is, for its time. And very gay! The innuendos and double-entendres are priceless. And Lemmon, who had one of the most expressive faces in film, gives an amazing performance. Tony Curtis looks scarily convincing as a woman (Lemmon just looks strange), and Marilyn is hypnotically beautiful and funny at the same time.This was a woman whom the camera truly loved. Pregnant during the making of the film, she looks just slightly more voluptuous than usual for the time - in fact gorgeous - and in closeups, ethereal, vulnerable, and breathtaking in a way that almost brings tears to the eyes.Joe E. Brown gives a hilarious performance as ""Daphne's"" suitor, and Tony Curtis gets to give his (passable, but still very funny) Cary Grant impression. Side note: I think it's pretty well known that there has been the legendary rumor for years that Curtis said that ""Kissing Marilyn Monroe was like kissing Hitler"" because of problems on the set with her erratic behavior. In recent years Curtis has claimed that he never made that statement. Whatever the truth, the pair do exhibit really wonderful chemistry in their love scene together, and the skin-colored/sequined dress Marilyn Monroe wears for that sequence is absolutely perfect. She couldn't sit down in it, so a special board/rest was set up for her.This is a film that still stands the test of time; a true ten-star classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Some like the fanfares d'amour hot.,"In the thirties ,Billy Wilder used to work in France ,where he made his first film ""mauvaise graine"",with Danielle Darrieux in 1934.The following year ,Richard Pottier made his ""fanfare d'amour"".So Wilder probably heard about it.Here's a short summary of ""fanfare d'amour"": Two comedians in dire straits,Jean and Pierre are chasing after any sort of work.This year,female combos are trendy.So they dress up as women and become part of ""Dutch tulips"" and all-women orchestra.Everybody take the night train .Jean and Pierre fall in love with Gaby and become rivals.But the girl has met Jean (in a man's clothes!) and she's crazy about him.Besides the theater director (a man!) falls also in love with Jean whom he mistakes for a woman!There's no coincidence;there are too many similarities between the 1935 ""fanfare d'amour"" and 1959 ""some like it hot"" .The former is impossible to see even in France where the telly never broadcasts it.Anyway,Wilder wins hands down:Richard Pottier was a moderately talented director,the American director a genius.Almost fifty years later,""some like it hot"" remains my all-time favorite comedy.And as this not avowed remake does not need a third one,because I could hardly imagine someone doing a better work than Wilder.Nobody's perfect ,but at his best he was.NB:actually,Wilder's inspiration was the German remake.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Funny Chase Mob Hit Cross Dressing Movie,"This is a fun movie for almost anyone. It combines the talents of Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, Billy Wilder, George Raft (old time gangster/actor), Joe E.

It might be hard to imagine Tony and Jack as girls but when they make their transition they do it completely having brand new personalities. Tony does three characters here.Joe E.

A comedy milestone way ahead of its time,"Some Like It HotThe premise for a comedy film being two men dressing up as women may seem commonplace in today's day and age, where anything, no matter taboo may be thrown in for a laugh (Kevin Smith anyone?), but for it's time, the central idea for ""Some Like It Hot"" must have seemed pretty risqué. Fortunately enough, director Billy Wilder really knows what he's doing, as he handles the somewhat delicate subject matter with a deft and confident hand, not overplaying the concept but instead extracting as many laughs as he can from it while still remaining totally tasteful, which in turn just makes the joke so much richer.The script is without a doubt one of the wittiest and best constructed of all time, with tons of wonderful back and forth exchanges between Lemmon and Curtis, and the period dialogue, with names like ""Spats Columbo"" and ""Toothpick Charlie"" is a treat to listen to. The period feel of great depression era costumes and sets are also excellent - all together, a very convincing feel of the time period. Not to mention that there is an actually suspenseful car chase, a cinematic rarity for the time.But more than anything else, the talking point is how entertaining and funny the whole film is. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are hilarious and charming as the two beleaguered leads, forced to masquerade as female musicians to save themselves from the mob. Marilyn Monroe has also never looked so beautiful, and despite the stories of the ridiculous number of takes it took her to get her lines right, in the final cut she comes across as fairly natural, even raising several laughs. The supporting cast also give great performances and manage to also raise many laughs, especially Joe E. Brown with the closing line ""Nobody's perfect"", which has to be one of the most memorable conclusions in film history.All in all, Some Like It Hot survives the cinematic test of time by coming across as just as funny when viewed currently as it must have been back in the 50s. The acting is wonderful, and Curtis and Lemmon have terrific chemistry together, and iconic Marilyn never fails to dazzle us. On a long night in need of a laugh or several, Some Like It Hot is most definitely worth a viewing - it is certainly more tasteful and unexpectedly hilarious than most contemporary comedies!-10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Awesome movie,"Some like It Hot has to be one of the funniest, most entertaining movies ever!  It is so funny that even the biggest sourpuss in the world would most likely laugh, especially about the very last line of the movie.  This reviewer has seen a lot of movies and Some like it Hot definitely is one of the best.  Old and young alike would enjoy this movie and that is always a good thing.Out of the entire movie there is only one thing that isn't too great about it.  Sometimes when the characters are running or riding bicycles the camera is angled so that the viewer is looking at them from the front.   The background behind them looks incredibly unreal during these scenes.  It's as if they are in front of a painting and they are riding on one of those bicycle exercise machines.  That is understandable though considering that it is a movie from the 50's.  That is about the only thing that could use some work in the movie.  If that whole scene was changed to be realistic than this movie would be nearly perfect.  It is so, so funny!!!The acting is great!  All the actors especially, Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, and Marilyn Monroe, are incredible! They are all so hilarious and their acting doesn't seem at all unreal, in fact, if there had been different actors/actress chosen for this movie, it wouldn't be as good.  Curtis, Lemmon, and Monroe are perfect together and they make for a very entertaining movie.The movie is in black and white, but it's as if it was in color.  The acting and just the way the movie is made, it all makes it so it's as if you can see what color everything would be if it was in color.  It is definitely not a boring black and white movie.Some like it Hot is a great comedy movie and this reviewer doesn't see how anybody could give it less than a 10.

Sugar Cane And Her 2 Crossdressing Friends,"When it comes to Hollywood movies about male sexual orientation and (cringe) cross-dressing - I'm sure glad to say that 1959's ""Some Like It Hot"" wasn't one where the men ""crossing over"" ever believed themselves to be really women trapped inside a man's body.(Phew! That was a close call!)And when it came to all of this deliberate gender deception with musicians, Joe and Jerry - I thought that Jack Lemmon (with hilarious confidence) clearly understood his ""Daphne"" character so much more completely than did Tony Curtis with his ""Josephine"".Of course - Having the voluptuous Marilyn Monroe (as Sugar Cane Kowalczyk) in this picture certainly did help to keep the charge of testosterone always crackling sharply just like a bolt of flash-lightning that never fails to strike in precisely the same place twice.Anyway - I'd say that this film's humorous ending between Daphne (Lemmon) and Osgood Fielding III (Brown) was a priceless touch of well-timed genius (thanks to director, Billy Wilder).",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Flawless comedy is played to perfection...,"I'm sure no one had to twist arms to get Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis to sign for the leading roles once they looked at the hilariously witty script by Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond. What must have looked good on paper is even funnier on the screen--the three stars give their all to make this one of the most memorable comedies of all time! (""Dumb and Dumber"" fans might not agree!!)The story begins with down on their heels musicians accidentally witnessing a gangland slaying by mobsters. Naturally, they flee the scene and decide the safest thing to do is disguise themselves as dames by joining an all-girl band in need of two musicians. Complications develop when Daphne (Jack Lemmon) falls for the charms of the band's singer, Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe). Hectic goings-on continue throughout the course of the fast-paced yarn, with Daphne being romanced by a sex-starved millionaire (Joe E. Brown) and Tony Curtis getting out of drag to woo Marilyn with his impersonation of Cary Grant. It's screwball comedy at its finest--with some of the punch lines buried under laughter (if you see it in a theater).The mad pace continues to the very end, with Lemmon deciding to accept the millionaire's marriage proposal--leading to the film's final punch line fadeout.Deserves its status as one of the best comedies of all time. An ingratiating performance by Monroe (and she CAN and does sing, contrary to someone's earlier comment on her voice), especially good in her scenes with Jack Lemmon's character. As for Lemmon, he all but steals the show once he grabs those maracas and fancies himself kicking up his heels as Daphne. He and Curtis underplay their cross-dressing assignments for the most part--but are still very funny.The dumbing down of comedy today--with leering one-liners about sex dominating all the dialog and toilet humor being ""in""--may leave some with the feeling that this is a mild mannered sex farce. But they're wrong. It's still a sizzler with more class than the dumb, sometimes gross jokes and situations that are the stuffing of the newer comedies like ""There's Something About Mary"".",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
It was pretty hot.,"What else could you expect from director Billy Wilder but a masterpiece when he's given such s terrific cast and good script like he had for ""Some like it hot"".  I mean, if you've seen ""Sunset boulevard"", ""Stalag 17"" and ""Witness for the prosecution"", it's impossible to think that ""Some like it hot"" might be kind of boring and anyway, if you think it's going to be boring, you're wrong.  Also, you might not have noticed, but most comedies (except for Woody Allen's ""Annie Hall"" and a few others of his) rarely hit the big-time or become timeless classics.  However, it was nice to see that AFI recognized ""Some like it hot"" as being a terrific comedy and they ranked it 14th on their 100 greatest American films.Two good friends, Jerry (Jack Lemmon) and Joe (Tony Curtis), witness a murder by one of the biggest gangsters but manage to escape but instead of running to the police, they decide to hide from the gangsters by dressing up as two women who play in a band (I forgot to mention that their job is to play in a band). It's on the trip with that band that they meet Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) and they naturally both fall in love with her.The rest of the movie is pure comedy and I don't want to spoil the fun for anybody so I guess you'll just have to see it.  The movie also has some great scenes like the one where Curtis imitates Cary Grant.  It's worth at least two good watches if not three.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

A perfect tonic for the blues,"I'm sure everything about this movie that needs to be said has already been said. It is one of the greatest movie comedies ever made, if not the greatest.

The film is one hilarious goof after another, both intentionally and accidentally.Even the fact that never would anyone mistake either Jack Lemmon or Tony Curtis (whether in drag or not) as anything but full-blooded heterosexual males, doesn't deter one away from the enjoyment.

"A fun movie, but perhaps overrated?","It's a funny movie but I'm a little amazed that it appears as the #1 comedy movie of all time with the AFI, and even at IMDB it's #50 (ahead of Chaplin & Marx Bros classics among others).  Yet compare the size of the ""memorable quotes"" page from ""Duck Soup"" to ""Some Like It Hot.""  The characters & love interests were all a bit shallow, and it wasn't a revolutionary film or anything like Chaplin & Marx Bros.  So I don't really understand what makes it a top-rated movie.  Is it a revolutionary film just because it had guys in drag in 1950's ""square"" America?On the other hand, to answer another critic here, it's silly to compare a screen legend like Marylin Monroe to a 90's plastic-surgery legend and non-actress like Pamela Lee Anderson etc.  They had actresses back then, not aerobicized bimbos who's best performances were with Tommy Lee on Internet-downloaded movie clips.

Funny Movie,"An old time funny movie with engaging performances from the 3 leads who are flowing with charisma and sex appeal.Surprisingly long for a comedy but it succeeds at holding your interest, filling the time with multiple versions of 'man wearing dress' jokes that work in most occurrences.I can imagine at the time of release it would have had a lot of people hot under the collar, now its kind of sweet and hokey.Good time to be had.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Classic Billy Wilder comedy with Marilyn Monroe,"Some Like It Hot is #14 on the American Film Institutes' Top 100 movies of all time. It's probably the best screwball comedy ever.Tony Curtis is a saxophone player and Jack Lemmon is a bass player who accidentally witness the 1929 St. Valentine's Day massacre in Chicago. To hide from the mob they dress as women and join an all girls' band that happens to have Marilyn Monroe as a singer. They ride on a train to a gig in Miami with all the girls and you can imagine what problems they encounter. Along the way, Tony Curtis falls for Marilyn and an old rich coot Joe E. Brown falls for Jack Lemmon who he thinks is a woman, of course.Jack Lemmon could never top his performance here as Jerry/Daphne. His portrayal as a woman with bad lipstick, ill-fitting dresses, and treacherous high heels is hysterical.Marilyn Monroe is an absolute knockout and this film shows her at her sexiest. She was also a great comedic actress.Tony Curtis is excellent as straight man to Jack Lemmon.The entire supporting cast is terrific and Billy Wilder's direction is right on. There isn't anything ""wrong"" about this great film. The photography is superb and the dialog is perfect.Of course, Joe E. Brown gets the best line in the movie, the famous last line which gets my vote for the all-time best last line in any movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Amazing given its time,"I must say, for a film of its time to delve into so many topics considered taboo for its time, it was amazing how it was able to do so in a way that doesn't seem so bad. Moreover, the comedy is just fantastic. Sure, it's definitely different from the comedy we see nowadays, but it still successfully remains relavent to our time. And of course, I found it pretty good. I am even surprised by how much I laughed during the movie.However, I will say that some parts of the plot felt a little abrupt. And there was so much creative space that could really have made this movie perfect.

Horrible!,"After an hour of grueling agony, my wife and I had to turn this god-awful waste of videotape off.  There wasn't anything even remotely funny in it, and everyone acted like a moron, especially Monroe's character. In fact, Marilyn Monroe showed off genuine talent because it's not easy to act that stupid.  She played the quintessential DUMB Blonde. In fact, the only good thing in the movie was that the acting was pretty good.

The Greatest Masterpiece of All Time,"The thing that makes this movie the best is the premise: men trying to imitate women!  Need I say more?  I am laughing so hard at this original concept I can barely type!

Imagine the hilarity of the situation!  Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are wonderful, and if you aren't paying attention, you can barely notice the contrived-sounding laughter they always emit after they deliver a punch line. Marilyn Monroe portrays a developmentally disabled woman, and everyone knows how sexually appealing mentally handicapped women are!  And her physical beauty shines even through the heavy layers of makeup she was forced to wear. Some people have called the dialogue inane, but the dialogue is irrelevant because you'll bust up laughing as you watch the wacky antics of Jack and Tony-in dresses and makeup!

To anyone who actually reads this and hasn't seen it, my advice to you is to run to the videostore and not just to rent it, but to buy it! This movie has changed my life totally. I'm sure it will change yours too (in a positive way, off course).It's strange that the teenagers now call themselves moviegoers, still if they haven't seen any good movie.

"Wilder. Lemmon, Brown,and the Incomparable MM should have won Oscarss","This film is legend for it brilliance. Billy Wilder created a film comedic masterpiece way way ahead of its time. MM's sings Running Wild, Some Like It Hot (which isn't in the final film.)Every scene is a classic in particular the legendary fade out: did Joe E. Brown and Lemmon marry? Marilyn Monroe was the most famous woman in the world and due to her performance taking an essentially supporting role and making it top billed over Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon became the biggest star in the universe. MM is glorious. I am tired of people mocking MM for being late on the set etc.MM was unique. MM was only a star for 10 short years: 1952-1962 but worked with Wilder, Mankiewicz, Huston, Hawks, Cukor and co starred with Gable,, Colbert, Grant, Davis Lemmon, Russell, Clift, Stanwyck,Marilyn's costumes designed by Orry-Kelly who won an Oscar for his costume are daring and fabulous.MM was robbed of nominations for Bus Stop, Some Like It Hot and Misfits. And should have won for Some Like It HotJack Lemmon, a Columbia contract star won an Oscar in best supporting actor for Mr. Roberts. Lemmon in hindsight should have won for Some Like It Hot which he did on loan out to UA. Some Like It Hot made Lemmon a true International movie star. Tony Curtis George Raft are superb in this film.MM was robbed of a nomination and should have won! Lemmon lost to Charlton Heston (in a Ben Hur sweep). Joe E Brown should have won in best supporting actor for his immortal performance with the legendary fadeout ""Nobody's Perfect!"" Much has been written about how Monroe and Wilder fought. In reality Wilder was MM greatest director and MM his greatest star.MM did this film at UA away from 20th her home studio, and made at least $2 Million in 1960 Value. About $25 Million in current value.This is a brilliant movie.Bravo: Wilder, Monroe, Lemmon, Brown, Curtis.RIP Monroe, Wilder, Lemmon, Bron, Curtis Mirisch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Everybody's perfect here.,"One question, which can be very simply answered, is why this production is so astronomically better than the slightly disappointing lesser Wilder flicks I've been watching recently.The one-word answer is: pace. This film is on the run all the way through, from the Valentine's Day Massacre, to Marilyn biking down the steps to the jetty, and it never lets up. It is gripping all the way, with not a single longueur. But there are other reasons. It's brilliantly scripted, and the dialogue is matchless. The gender-bending is wholly undisturbing and somehow actually tasteful. Curtis as a shady Cary Grant is unforgettable. Sweet Sue and Beanstalk are made for each other. Another reviewer points out that George Raft wasn't told he was in a comedy. Joe E Brown's one-note is pitch-perfect. But the real reason for this film's perfection is Marilyn. Her neuroses are legendary, her unreliability iconic. She kissed like Hitler, and needed 30 takes for every line. These, and her visibly stunning starriness, must have spurred the rest of the cast and the director on to reaching even greater heights. Wilder did make some great films, but this is the hottest. For all to like.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
the girls in the band,"A comedy classic from Billy Wilder which regularly comes in at the top or near the top of 'funniest of all time' lists, this feature has many assets. First, there's a sweet and infectious portrayal by Marilyn Monroe of the lonely singer Sugar, on the hunt for a rich man.  Then there is the chance to see Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in drag for much of the movie - Lemmon, as daft Daphne, looks a fright but puts in a great, bubbly, comic performance as the girl who really does snare her own millionaire; while Curtis, as the overly made-up Josephine, sashays about with some style, while also appearing as a mock playboy who talks like Cary Grant (allegedly).George Raft is the gangleader the 'girls' are running away from; while Joe E Brown is great as Daphne's beau Osgood, a man who after lots of marriages to show girls will marry just about anyone!  The script piles on the laughs thick and fast, while Marilyn gets to sing songs like 'I Wanna Be Loved By You', 'Runnin' Wild', and 'I'm in the Mood for Love'.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
One of America's funniest films,"Billy Wilder was a masterful director. The American Film Institute names this movie the greatest comedy of all time. It's not hard to see why. Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are excellent. Monroe, I never saw her as an amazing actress, but she did pretty good in this film all the same.
The humor is top notch and very smart. The funniest parts are when Curtis and Lemmon are bickering with each other. Apparently the black and white look was done because both of their makeup made them look so ugly that Wilder thought black and white cinematography would conceal their ugly makeup. Nothing wrong with that though, black and white movies rock! 
It's a great comedy. One for the ages! Is it the best comedy ever? No. Not in my mind. But is it too 5? Absolutely!",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Good, But Not One of the Greatest Comedies of All Time","My wife loves this movie, mostly on the strength of Jack Lemmon's wild performance, but I have to admit that I've remained resistant to its charms. I don't DISLIKE it, but I always have trouble understanding how it pops up again and again on various lists as one of the funniest comedies ever produced.Of course, much of my lack of appreciation probably has to do with the fact that cross dressing comedies have become a dime a dozen now, but were virtually unheard of at the time this film was released. And even more notable, Jack Lemmon's character actually kind of LIKES pretending to be a woman, so this film manages to work in some fairly ahead of its time gender politics into its mostly escapist comedy trappings. But the film is hampered by too much Marilyn Monroe, who was just a terrible actress, like it or not. The woman could not act, and no amount of sex appeal (though I think she had very little of that as well) could change that fact.Still, my reservations aside, the strengths in this film mostly outweigh the weaknesses. Billy Wilder delivers a sharp script even if his direction seems to be at cross purposes with the movie's comedic elements, and Tony Curtis gives a hilarious and dead-on impersonation of Cary Grant that rivals Lemmon's manic antics in its pricelessness.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Screenplay and chemistry is what still stacks up.,"Classic American screwball comedy. A must see if you are the type to clock up viewing of the 'greats' otherwise the humor can seem quite dated and corny unless you watch it whilst keeping in mind how risqué and fresh it was for it's day. However, the mad screenplay and the chemistry between Curtis, Lemmon and Monroe still stacks up 100% by anyones standards. Much of it is just too silly for words but it works beautifully and is totally enjoyable.There is a camp element about the Curtis and Lemmon behavior that is hard to reconcile where it is coming from (especially Lemmon's character). Seemingly way sophisticated for the day it strikes me that I'm missing something in interpretation about this angle. Maybe it's because I was not even born let alone a young adult in 1959 and don't have the cultural references of the day to 'get it'. Either way, very much a fun movie to watch in 2005.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Best Kept Secrets: Some Like it Hot,"In America today, it seems at least every other movie that opens is a remake. But if you're willing to put forth a little effort, an original, worthwhile film can always be found.Some Like It Hot begins in Chicago in the year 1929 and later moves to Florida. Jerry, played by the impeccable Jack Lemmon, and Joe, portrayed by Tony Curtis, are the dynamic duo that makes this film truly spectacular. When the two friends witness the St. Valentine's Day massacre, they are forced to flee the state. They decide to go undercover and take a job with an all girl band. Only Billy Wilder could have imagined the hilarity that ensues.Tony Curtis' role, posing as the millionaire was based on Cary Grant and is superb. Jack Lemmon's comedic timing and delivery stand out. There are numerous priceless role reversals between Joe and Jerry. Marilyn Monroe's performance is tolerable. It is interesting to realize she wasn't the thinnest actress in Hollywood but has become a legend because of her beauty.The film was written, produced, and directed by the masterful Billy Wilder. It is a parody of the 1920's with several witty references including the stock market crashing and prohibition. Billy Wilder is fantastic at creating tense situations as the characters switch back and forth between their roles. Pay careful attention and you won't be disappointed.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

"Swingy, Cool, Hot","From a first point of view, `Some like it hot,' appears to be a story about two young musicians  who are looking for a job, while at the same time are in trouble with the mafia.  The two Musicians end up leaving  town for a job to pay off their debts,  but to find out exactly what happens  in this movie, you must see it to believe it. 	In the beginning,  a police chase is going on between the police and a mysterious car loaded up with a coffin.   The car out runs the police, and arrives  at a funeral home.  Two men  get out of the car  and unload a coffin that was filled with alcoholic beverages.   At the same time the police are plotting to crack down on a secret party in side the funeral home because they are serving alcohol which was illegal at the time.There is loud music and dancing going on inside the funeral home.   Jack Lemmon (Jerry) and Tony Curtis (Joe) are playing in the band while the police jump in on the party, thus ending their job as musicians in the band. The dynamic duo is looking for a job so they hear about an all girls band that is traveling down to Florida.  They were not interested, until they were caught witnessing a murder done by the mafia.  The two realized that they must get out fast.  They shaved their legs, grabbed their frocks and headed for the train to Florida.  Jack Lemmon's character from this point is a female bass player by the name of Daphne.  Tony Curtis' character is a female tenor sax player named Josephine.  Daphne and Josephine, meet Sugar (Marilyn Monroe) on the train to Florida.  They all arrive at their hotel in Florida. Daphne is carrying three instruments, when she stumbles and meets who is a middle aged millionaire named Osgood Fielding III, who has a perverted mind.   While Daphne and Sugar are playing with the girls on the beach, Tony Curtis dresses back up as a man so he can try and score a date with Sugar.  While they are performing, Daphne receives a bouquet of flowers from Osgood, and was asked to have dinner with him.  At the same time Josephine's male form Joe   is on a date with Sugar.  The next day, the mafia shows up to the hotel, for a convention of Italian opera singers. They suspect something is up when they see Daphne and Josephine.   They suddenly realize that the two women, were also the two men who witnessed the murder that they committed.   A couple men from the mafia began chasing Daphne and Josephine around.  Josephine escaped and was running  in to the ballroom where the band was playing.  While she was running, she tripped and landed on Sugar.  Everyone found out that Josephine was a man.  Right away she began to run  out of the ball room.  As she was running out, she met up with Daphne and Osgood.  The three started running for Osgood's boat.  After they all got in his boat, Sugar came running down from the dock, and jumped into the boat.  Josephine/Joe is upset and tells Sugar that she should go back, but Sugar still loves HIM.  At the same time, Daphne tries to convince Osgood that she is not for him, but  he doesn't buy it.  She then does something unbelievable! can't be said with out spoiling.  In other words I guess Osgood still likes Daphne/Jerry.  To the reviewer, this is a funny but sick ending. 	Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis do a wonderful job playing the two girls,  it is just as if they were trying to get in touch with their feminine side. Jack Lemmon's Character is silly and wild, while at the same time, Tony Curtis's Character is serious and smart.  The two make a great duo in this film. 	The Reviewer would rate this movie Five out of Five Gold Stars.  It is incredibly funny seeing two men dress up as women and pulling it all off, with out any one really noticing right away.   This movie is worth renting. Be sure to make room for this on your video rack!",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Very Funny,"An all girl jazz band,marlyn monroe, and two cross dressers? This could only be ""Some like it hot."" Marlyn Monroe does an excellent job at being a stero-typical blonde. She cannot resist tenor sax players and never stops and always gets hurt.Her character is not one of the best,her weakness' are men, and alcohol. She is very naive, but plays the part well of a sexy jazz singer of the times. Her voice and good looks are a natural attraction to Joe. (Who happens to befriend her while being dressed like a girl)He learns of the heartbrakes that she has had during her life and vows not to hurt her. But when he can no longer resist her he devises a plan to win her heart and not hurt her at the same time. But when he has to leave suddenly,he blows his cover and she cannot resist him and his tenor sax.This movie however, is very funny. The fact that they must dress up as women, and the billionaire who does not care that Daphne is really Jerry is hillarious. The extreme to which Joe tries to win Sugar over is amazing, to plunging in a bath tub with all their clothes on, and dressing up as a yacht owner to a yacht he doesn't even own. This is then topped by Jerry and Joe running from the mob dressed in girls clothing and heels. A funny movie for all to watch. Overall I would give this movie a 7 out of 10 for humour.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Still the Gold Standard,"""Some Like It Hot"" is the best farce ever produced by a major Hollywood studio. Viewed as farce and not as a straight comedy -- but it's both -- its lofty position on so many ""movie best"" lists is easily understood.The glue that holds ""Some Like It Hot"" together on screen is Jack Lemmon. His scene with Marilyn Monroe in the upper berth of the train is probably his most brilliant in the film, but he has several. Its dialogue is top heavy with innuendo, and no one but Lemmon could have pulled it off without descending into embarrassing burlesque. The script requires Tony Curtis to do an extended burlesque, and while he was not the subtle comedian that Lemmon was, his ""Cary Grant"" is still a comic delight.The exposition is lengthy for a comedy, but sets up numerous punchlines that will be used again and again. Such gags as the one about ""type O blood"" actually get funnier with repetition.Pat O'Brien's Chicago detective is always overlooked in discussions of this film. I don't think he has a single line that isn't a pun. His deadpan delivery may be lost on audiences who don't recall the dozens of crime movies he made at Warner Brothers in the 30s where he played this sort of role straight.According to legend, ""Some Like It Hot"" was filmed in black and white for two reasons, one of which is the (very) revealing costumes Marilyn Monroe wears on the bandstand. The second is that Billy Wilder fretted that he could not get Lemmon's and Tony Curtis's drag makeup to look believable in color.:sigh: I'm afraid younger viewers are put off by B/W movies. TCM hosts Robert Osborne and Ben Mankiewicz share my thinking, and I have heard both men urge viewers to give a black and white movie a chance.In a world where the Vice President of the United States can tell a senior U.S. Senator to ""go blank himself,"" and Janet Jackson can do a striptease on national television, I'm afraid ""Some Like It Hot"" must seem creaky and stodgy indeed. Yet, ""It's not what's said and shown, it's what ISN'T said and shown"" that make ""Some Like It Hot"" such a treat.It should never have worked, but Wilder and writing partner I.A.L. Diamond and a gifted cast breathed life into dozens of hoary clichés. Taking on such broad, heavily mined topics as the battle of the sexes, gangsters, Prohibition and skirt-chasing musicians was a gamble, but it worked. It worked in 1959, and it works today because there is no psychological subtext weighing down the story, as there is with ""Tootsie"" (1982).""Tootsie"" is a drag comedy that wants audiences to laugh, but also to rethink and ponder gender roles in society. ""Some Like It Hot"" has no such pretensions, which is why it has not dated as much as more recent comedies that share its theme.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
average movie,"Some Like It Hot? How about some like it perverted! This is surprisingly a very sexual driven movie, especially for the era. The movie is very sneaky with the dirty jokes. Some Like It Hot is about two men ( Joe and Jerry) on the run from the mob. They end up in disguise in none other than women's clothes to escape from the mob. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon did great playing females! A little too well. They were a great comedic duo and made the film funny. Who didn't need to be in the film is Marilyn Monroe who played Sugar the girl that Joe and Jerry of course fall for. The Sugar character is funny, but the casting director could have most likely found someone better than Marilyn Monroe. The only reason they should have Marilyn in the film is because of the music. She did do well singing the cute yet sultry songs that were in the movie.  It's hard to believe Marilyn Monroe was such an icon in that decade and still is today. Yes, she is pretty, but her acting skills were not great in this movie. It seemed like she was forcing the lines and facial expressions out. The plot is predictable now, but most likely in the 50's it wasn't predictable since it was very risky. It is not the funniest film ever but funny enough to at least see once. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon's comedic talents were the highlight of the movie, but unfortunately Marilyn's bad acting skills somewhat ruined the film.

Guess not my cup of tea,"I still hold firmly to the believe that people who can laugh scene after scene, movie after movie, to the depiction of applying women's mannerisms on male bodies, are indistinguishable from being permanently brain-injured.To be fair, the movie includes quite a bit of fun besides the cross-dressing. Also, while the transvestism per se isn't funny, it opens nice ways for the plot to develop.

Sugar Kane (Marilyn) wants to meet a millionaire while on her musical tour, and thinks Curtis fits the bill.Jack Lemmon, Curtis' partner in crime, dressed as a female attracts a multi-millionaire (who assumes he is a woman) well portrayed by Joe E.

Marilyn Monroe's best film,"This old film was shown on TV and I was interested in is this good or bad. Luckily I didn't waste time. Some Like It Hot is real classic in its own genre. Regardless of age it's still funny comedy. Especially some characters are very humoristic. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are amusing when they pretend to be a woman in order to escape from Chicago because of the gangsters who are after them. They are musicians in a speakeasy during the Prohibition Act and witness events involving gangsters and machine guns. This is why they escape. Marilyn Monroe acts a singer who get to know to the characters of Curtis and Lemmon. The boys go to the band as woman and Monroe with other women of the band doesn't know the truth. This causes funny situations. Maybe the best quote is saved for the last scene. Humor of Some Like It Hot is a mix of situation comedy and cross-dressing which isn't too exaggerated and is better than most of comedies.

"Billy Wilder's Some Like It Hot is still among the greatest movie comedies, if not the greatest","I've only seen this movie once before on the late show when I lived in Jacksonville, FL, with my aunts. I remember thinking this was pretty funny. Now that I've watched this on DVD with my mom (who had never seen this before), it's even more funny than I remembered it. I mean, seeing Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon try to convincingly play women in order to escape some gangsters, especially in front of the actual females they're surrounded with, can be pretty funny since they don't really look anything similar to them but I guess the fact that many of them do drink might have been a factor. And then there's Marilyn Monroe, looking as luminous as one expects but also one of the most charismatic of actresses especially considering her off-screen troubles that seemed to affect everyone involved including director Billy Wilder. Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond's screenplay just cackles with such great lines. Oh, and I also loved Joe E. Brown's performance as the millionaire that falls for Lemmon's character. His seemed to be the best one here, even better than Lemmon's who was the only player to get an Oscar nomination. And while George Raft and Pat O'Brien played their typed roles of gangster and cop, they played them well enough to still deliver the goods.

(that is looking at you Big Momma and Tyler Perry) Ranked as the greatest American comedy by AFI (as at Oct 2012), the movie is a remake of a 1935 French movie, Fanfare d'Amour and was meant to be shut in color but as the makeup of both Curtis and Lemmon was obvious it was then shut in black and white.Marilyn Monroe can carve a M in to a rock with her smile and her acting is so well done that you are intrigued to see her anytime. Monroe is known mostly as a sex icon, and this movie assisted in such claims as the dresses she wore were more too seductive to be classified as funny. To say she had the movie by the balls will be a statement men will agree to, when they are watching this flick.The plot is about two male musicians who will do absolutely anything for money as they are constantly broke. They were in the wrong place at the wrong time and witness a mobster performing his ""executionary"" duties. This made them run off while being shut at.To hide from their pending death, they took a job as musicians in an all-girl band. So to fit in they shaved their legs, wore makeup and wore a dress to pass as women.But things took a turn for the worse when Marilyn Monroe strolled by.The film was awarded an Academy Award for Best Costume Design. It also won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy. Marilyn Monroe won the Golden Globe for Best Actress in Musical or Comedy, and Jack Lemmon for Best Actor in Musical or Comedy.Billy Wilder the director is one of only five people to have won Academy Awards as producer, director, and writer for the same film (The Apartment). Tony Curtis has been in over a 100 films and he is the father of actress Jamie Lee Curtis.Lemmon is popular in these days as the actor in the movie Odd Couple.Some Like It Hot, is a movie I advise you watch over and over again. Like the last line of the movie goes ""Nobody is perfect"" I say I'm not the perfect comedy judge but I wanna know if you agree with me.www.lagsreviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A lens to view our changes in gender identity,"Humor, beyond the pure pleasure of laughter, can provide insights into the rules, norms and taboos of the times that by showing the distortion that provides release. At the time this was made, it was focused on a bygone era of murderous mobsters and their living sex toys.Not only were gender roles defined, there were to the degree that the issue hadn't even been raised, neither in the time of depiction 1929 or three decades later when the film was made. The fun was that all it took for men to gambol with the chicks was their putting on dresses and wigs, and raising their voice an octave.The DVD shows the complete film with commentary by the son of billy Wilder's co-writer, Babaloo Mandell along with Jack Lemon and Tony Curtis, describing more than the technical aspects Most touching were how Marilyn Monroe resonated to the fictional character. Curtis, without any bravado, told of how his on stage scene when he convinced her that he was impotent, and with tenderness and passion she ""cured"" him, echoed their actual love affair previously.We also see the genius of writer director Billy Wilder at work in a way that can't be described outside of such a film as this where his interpersonal and literary talents were at play. While this is appropriately in the genre of comedy, it is really so much more. It is a love story, and a tale of the tragedy of the real Norma Jeane that was never far away from the actress. Sure, at times the pain of her early life (see Wikipedia) broke through to the detriment of efficiency of the filming. But so what? The film on one level provided laughter, but on another insight into the human condition.It is also a benchmark of sexual stereotypes where the setup for that final memorial line, the universal absurdity of the disclosure that the object of sexual desire would not make a suitable wife because, ""I'm a guy."" This was a world where women could roll in bed together without any thought of sexuality between them, and the joke was there were two who were pretending, only playing a role, performing a part.How far the world has come, a truth that must be acknowledged whether pleased or disturbed by the revolution. And the coda, ""Nobody's Perfect"" takes on a more profound irony behind the laughter.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Stands the name of comedy films,"this is maybe a little bit weird now,but it's one of most funnest movies ever created.Marilyn Monroe,Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon. and director was billy wilder.Two Struggling musicians witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre and try to find a way out of the city before they are found and killed by the mob. The only job that will pay their way is an all girl band so the two dress up as women. In addition to hiding, each has his own problems; One falls for another band member but can't tell her his gender, and the other has a rich suitor who will not take ""No,"" for an answer.i recommend this movie to it.and yes Monroe was hot there.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Typical For The Time,"Though done well, adding the musical element to it is typical for the time. For some reason unless it was marketed as a drama the element of song seems to be part of movies made up and through that era.Don't get me wrong, the acting was great as Monroe especially really draws you in, but I cannot say it was a comedy. I know that's what it was meant to be and it probably was for its time, but I honestly didn't laugh once.",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
It helped to change the genre.,"Although you can still somewhat describe this movie being somewhat of a screwball comedy, it's also really a movie that has more hints of a more modern type of comedy in it. The overall comedy and approach of it all and the story feels more matured and seriously put together, as if it was a movie out of a far more serious and respected genre, such as a drama or a thriller. It makes me sort of see ""Some Like It Hot"" as the first 'modern' comedy.In essence this is actually being one very simple movie. It relies almost entirely on its main premise of having two guys who are forced, due to circumstances, to dress up as girls and to join an all female band, in order to get away from the mobsters that are chasing them and want to kill them. But of course lots of other stuff starts to happen and things get complicated more once they start the trip. They get themselves even in more trouble, which is of course all due to Marilyn Monroe.It's perhaps Marilyn Monroe's most iconic and memorized roles. She never was the best actress around but she still always had an incredible screen presence, which made audiences fall in love with her. It was of course not in the least due to her looks but also thanks to her naive, girl-like charm. Besides, her singing was also always great and she does some good singing in this and sing her most recognizable song 'I Wanna Be Loved By You' in this. But you really shouldn't forget about Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon. I mean, they are the ones acting in drag, mostly throughout the entire movie. They truly become almost unrecognizable, which is not just because of the way how they look but also due to their fine acting. I wouldn't imaging there were many actors at the time, fighting over a role to play a female character for almost the entire movie but they are the ones that simply did it and for that along they already should get a lot of respect.It's a pleasantly fast moving movie, that takes us to a lot of places and there is always something going on. The characters are great comedy ones and then I am of course also talking about its fine supporting cast, that also has some other quite big names in it from the past, such as George Raft and Pat O'Brien.One of the first great and successful 'modern' comedies.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

great fun,"Some Like it Hot is a wild and adventurous comedy that anyone can enjoy. Having a plot of two musicians that are looking for a gig once their previous club was raided; they witness a mass murder by the boss and his henchmen.  Desperate to flee for their lives, they take a job as two women musicians in a girl's traveling band.Who other to be in the girls traveling band than Marilyn Monroe, the sexy, seductive, cute and spunky sex icon of the 50s.  This, on top of the absolutely hilarious plot, makes for one great movie.  Playing off of Marilyn's sexuality, the whole movie is basically based on the Joe and Jerry's attraction and yearns for sugar, yet, obviously, it is out of the question.Having a very well casted crew and the perfect idea, plot, and quite a hilarious ending, this turns out to be quite an enjoyable movie.  Obviously, being based a lot on sexual desire, you may not want your children to watch this movie, but it is very gratifying to any audience of a slightly higher age. 	 	If you have heard any positive things of this movie, you have heard right. The only great movies are the ones made in the good ol' black and white days.  Overall, this movie receives a 9/10 for everything within it.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
ultimate comedy,"Jack Lemmon is downright hilarious in this one because he plays his role with gusto and seriousness. There are moments in this film so crazy, so impossible to believe, and yet, because of this man's superb acting job, we are in comedy heaven. Lemmon's Daphne is one of the most incredible and masterful acting jobs in the history of cinema. His comedic exchanges with each of the other actors in this film are a wonder to witness. When he is with Monroe, we never doubt he has become possessed by the spirit of his creation. Minutes after his engagement, watching him plan his wedding is a riot, and no one can keep a straight face while he is dancing with his soon-to-be fiancé.Billy Wilder once again proved his talent as one of the most multi-talented directors in Hollywood as he guided all the members of his troupe to this terrific films.

"If I ever make a Top 10 of my favorite movies this would be in it, part 2","There are some days, weeks and months when you just have to take a break from everything you do and relax. This year wasn't very good to me as I'm sure it's been to a lot of people but you have to return to where you belong, where everything is familiar, where there's laughter and nobody's perfect.""Some like it hot"" is directed by Billy Wilder and it stars the handsome Tony Curtis, fantastic Jack Lemmon and charming Marilyn Monroe. I remember the first time I watched this movie - I was about 7 or 8 years old and I rolled with laughter then, along with my parents who also loved this movie dearly. Since then I've watched it god knows how many times and each time I get something new, and everytime it feels like the first time all over again.They don't make 'em like that anymore - is exactly what I was thinking while watching Tony and Jack cross-dress, speak with higher voices, wear high heels and joke about a man marrying a man - and I guess they never will. Today's society has gotten stiffer over the years, and is now more reluctant to joking about something that can potentially offend people and I get it, it's only right, it's progress but wouldn't it be nice to have an immortal movie like that among us again? In the end it's a comedy movie and as long as it makes us roll with laughter we're still the same good old selves, just switching off for two magnificent hours to escape the brute reality.To me ""Some like it hot"" is a holy grail of comedy and more so of a romantic comedy. It doesn't only put people into an unusual situation and observes the consequences - it teaches them to use it to win, not only get what they want but also learn other people's perspective and become better human beings in the process. It doesn't happen every day that you become somebody else, see yourself and everything you do through outsider's eyes and question all of the things you've known and thought you knew before because after all if a movie doesn't change anything in you for the better it is a bad movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

I liked how the movie ended,"(1959) Some Like It Hot
COMEDYProduced, co-written and directed by Billy Wilder with the set up that has two, down on their luck musicians, saxophone, Joe (Tony Curtis) and double bass player, Jerry (Jack Lemmon) accidentally stumbling onto a mob hit. Forcing them to go on the run, dress in drag and participating to an all ladies music group while the mob led by Spats Colombo (George Raft ) are on pursuit. Used as a backdrop to many comedy routines.If it wasn't for the ending I don't think I would've given this film a positive rating, for the film seems to have drag on and on for this film is not very realistic in these so- called current times such as if any man were to get- away with dressing up as a woman- he would exploit the situation to the the highest degree and it does ""not"" show enough of it in this film. And these days people are a little more sophisticated for instance, if anybody were to just put on a wig and lipstick, can it really fool anybody for that matter- I don't think so. I very much enjoy watching Billy Wilder films a lot like ""The Apartment"" since I can very much relate to the situations involved as well as it's characters which this film does not do very often.

That gives quite a potential for funny and exciting situations, and this movie utilizes this potential in a very good way. This is one of the old movies who are still as funny today, despite it's age. The last part of the movie is especially good, when the mob starts to get involved again.

Overrated and not very funny comedy,This movie has appeared on television countless times but I was never able to sit through it until recently. I still don't find this movie very funny. Neither Curtis nor Lemon look like a woman. Neither has the build of a woman. They are both too broad and look took masculine so how they can fool everyone for almost the entire picture is beyond my comprehension.One of the genuinely funny scenes was toward the end when Spats got his comeuppance at his surprise early birthday bash.I found Marilyn Monroe's performance quite good. She may be the only actress who looks as beautiful in black and white as in color. I imagine it may have something to do with her platinum blonde hair.,5.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

You've got to love it!,"What makes a film funny? If we were to be completely honest, we would probably admit that the film has to make us want to laugh and that there are several quite different ways to do so.""Some Like It Hot"" hooks you with its characters, who are all small and very sympathetic fish in a wild current of events that they never control and still dream that by them they'll find their luck in life.Little pleasures of little people, set during the prohibition the film misses no opportunity to show ordinary people secretly drinking, thus furnishing an echoing background of its major theme, the quest for love and money. There are a lot of great punch lines, like ""Nobody talks like that."" (Cary Grant does indeed!) or ""Well, don't look now, but the whole town is underwater!"", but where the film touches the sublime is when Joe and Sugar tell themselves badly masked lies, everyone of them hoping to profit from the other in an extraordinary relationship, while in fact its just the repetition of the same kind of relationship that Joe and Sugar are having all of the time.Besides, it's a pleasure to see Jack Lemon throwing himself into his role as he does. If it wouldn't be for his childish enthusiasm, the whole wonderful ""crowded bed scene"" wouldn't be half as funny as it is.Because of this and because of its wonderful music and its marvelous pacing that leaves you no moment uninvolved ""Some Like It Hot"" is one of the best comedies ever made, if not the best, but since I saw ""Kin-Dza-Dza"" I don't want to claim that any more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Pityful,"Some like it Hot is a film that contains a blend of adjectives; humorous, seductive, ironic, pitiful, just to name a few. The plot of the film is rather funny as two men take on a journey in which they witness a crime which then shuttles them to an adventurous chase, (in which they are the ones chased). Marilyn Monroe's presence in this film makes every scene she is seductive, and as to Marilyn's talent; as an actress she is an amazing doctor.It is pitiful to watch this film reflect a view on women in the 50's, for the way in which they are all portrayed as gold diggers who lack the confidence in becoming anything else than a housewife. In this case Some like it Hot does a good job on demonstrating life back then. This film's popularity is solely due to Monroe's rising popularity as well. It is a bit ironic how Monroe's character has a weakness for men and turns to alcohol when her relationships tumble down. This is a very close portrayal to her real life, making the film all about Marilyn Monroe.

Marilyn Monroe is not just a beautiful bimbo in her role as Sugar Kane, but she shows us here just what a great loss her early death was. George Raft never had a comedic appearance like this burlesque of his own gangster roles. All that being said, Joe E.

"Some like ""Some Like it Hot"", and I'm one of them","""Some Like it Hot"" is Billy Wilder's classic farce about a pair of male musicians (Tony Curtis & Jack Lemmon) who join a female band in order to hide out from the mob. Naturally, complications ensue, not the least of which is the temptation presented by luscious fellow musician Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe). More than fifty years later the film is regarded as one of the finest American comedies ever and I concur.I was already well aware of Lemmon's comedic prowess but I had no idea that Tony Curtis could pull off a role like he did here. In my opinion, he steals the show although the three principle actors each have memorable moments and great chemistry together. Given the talent of Curtis & Lemmon, Marilyn's somewhat limited acting skills would seem to be the weak link here but she nevertheless fits in well, all the while oozing that elusive quality they call 'star power'.The script does a good job of blending high- and low-brow comedy. There's no shortage of snappy dialogue and farcical situations. Even gangland executions can't put a damper on the proceedings. Wilder's directorial style is crisp and follows the action admirably. The entire visual & aural package is attractive but the emphasis is firmly placed where it should be: on the comedy.So, there you have it.

"Oscars for MM, Jack Lemmon, Joe E Brown, Wilder and Picture","Some Like It Hot is arguably the funniest movie ever made. I remember when the picture was announced, and MM had been off the screen for a while. I was so happy to see MM back to work and anticipated its release. In my wildest hopes could I ever image the classic picture it became.Billy Wilder initially wanted Frank Sinatra to star with Jack Lemmon. Mitzi Gaynor was to be Sugar Kane. However when MM found out about the script her agents approached Wilder and after clearing the pix with her home studio 20th Century Fox MM became Sugar Kane in this UA pic and an immortal iconic portrayal resulted. We all know of the battles MM had with Wilder and their mutual antagonism towards each other. Such is the price of Genius. Tony Curtis replaced Sinatra and the billing was Monroe-Curtis-Lemmon. Curtis who recently died carped about MM all his life and I feel some of it is because MM took an essentially supporting role and made it the star role. While Curtis was excellent Jack Lemmon is magnificent. A special notation should be for Joe E Brown who was retired but cameback to work and gave an memorable performance.""Some Like It Hot' is very sophisticated today, 50 years ago it was stunning.

like nitro and glycerin...,"Where would this world be without men dressing up like women?  After witnessing a mob hit, down-and-out musicians Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) do just that in order to escape from being the mob's next victims.  Having seen the storyline in previous movies, Some Like it Hot is still one hilarious movie.Dubbed `the best comedy of the year' when it was first released, the years since haven't taken away any of the wacky and clever humor that Some Like it Hot contains.  There is nothing wrong with this movie from what this reviewer could see.  The type of humorous antics pulled off, like men in dresses and a budding romance between a millionaire and Lemmon will keep a viewer rolling in their seats for the duration on the film.Lets talk about chemistry for a moment.  Not the kind you kind in the science room, but the kind between two people.  Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon had great chemistry together, they were like nitro and glycerin, together they were explosive!  They were what made the movie, sure, Marilyn Monroe did a great job with the `dumb blond' role, but it was the men in drag that kept the moving going.Again, this was a great movie.  Great actors and a humorous storyline come together to make Some Like it Hot a treat for the whole family.

Charming but way overated.,"A recent poll in saw this come out as the best comedy of all time.Beating the likes of Odd Couple and Airplane!, Some Like It Hot is revered by so many, and while I can see the charm of it and concede that the performances are really excellent, the film *really* isn't that funny.It stars Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon as 2 witnesses to a mob shooting. They're a saxophonist and a bass player respectively who're part of a band, but the mob are after them after escaping from the hit, and the only way they can hide is to dress up as women and join a female band. Enter the amazing Marilyn Munroe as a band member (Sugar Cane) they befriend - it just so happens they're both crazy about her yet cannot give up the facade of their disguises.This provides much fuel for the contrivance of some very funny moments as Curtis' 'Josephine' sets about wooing her (By putting on an impression of a millionaire) while Lemmon's 'Daphne' gets the short end of the deal every time.To say the least, the performances are truly top drawer, *particularly* Munroe's Cane, who even in the 21st century utterly exudes sex appeal. This was surely her finest role.The boys do a great turn too and the chemistry is spot on from one adventure to the next.The problem is the situations are in places funny, but it's never *truly* the funniest thing you'll ever see. The script in the Odd Couple (For me the greatest comedy ever) is head and shoulders above this, and that's what sets it apart. Sure, there are some very witty and intelligent lines here too, but somehow they're greater in number in the Odd Couple. I single the Odd Couple out as it was also focused on a cracking comedic partnership and also starred Lemmon. It also benefitted from greater comic timing.This is certainly a classy comedy which is well acted and thoroughly enjoyable, but it suffers from a little bit of overhyping.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

In 1959 - Probably Hilarious. In 2022 - Average Comedy at Best.,"The film is easy to watch, but has aged badly comedy wise. It's just not that funny to me, but it is entertaining with some nice shots, acting and interesting characters.Monroe looks tired in this and on the way to being a larger women. It's hard to connect her to the world wide phenomenon of her alleged sex appeal here. She's probably the weak link, merely hired for her name and isn't very compelling acting wise - but the story behind it is that she was clearly suffering health wise.I imagine if watching it in 1959 then it would be funny and new, but drag is now very common to the slightly disturbing point where dragged up men go into school reading sessions... It is from this perspective, slightly dysfunctional, but so very normalised that it pulls the shock rug factor from under the carpet of this film and really leaves us with a fairly generic love story where the man is deceitful in his quest for love - that is apparent in most films.I can't really see anyone laughing out aloud to this if they are below the age of 75, and that is fine.",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Quite frankly I find this to be one of the biggest washouts I've seen.The film mostly relies on one joke which grows very old, very quickly. The writing is no where close to some of Wilder's others(best) like Double Indemnity or Sunset Bloulevard. It's so 'light' that the characters seem a lightyear from danger; which is the motivation behind much of the plot. And Marilyn Monroe is, frankly put, an atrocious actress.I have considerable respect for Billy Wilder and considering the acclaim this film has recieved over the decades I had decent expectations. But Some Like It Hot is a middling comedy and by no means a great film. I mostly give it as many stars as I do, out of intimidation from its devotees.",5.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"A true classic, one of the best.","This movie is truly an awesome film that everyone should give themselves the chance to see. This comedy is truly funny with some scenes just being full of belly laughs, the likes of which some modern comedies never even come close to producing.  A farce that hits all the right notes, this movie has excellent direction and pacing that never drags. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon give outstanding performances in drag that are hilarious.

"I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl ImagirlImagirl...","After just viewing 'Some Like It Hot' for the very first time, I must say that I can barely write a cohesive review of it. It is the finest and best-acted comedy I have seen, ever.Even though it clocks in at just over two hours, SLIH is entertaining from beginning to hysterical end - barely slowing the pace to give a viewer time to get restless. The trio of lead actors, the snappy, innuendo-laden dialogue, the romance, the comedy, the snazzy music, the believable plot: all of these elements meld perfectly into a vivacious, vibrant movie.While Tony Curtis doesn't disappoint with delivery here, it is Jack Lemmon and Marilyn Monroe who compete for the starring role - one well-deserved by both, to say the least. Lemmon's frustrated, desperate, easily-persuaded character pairs flawlessly with Curtis' scheming, womanizing 'Josephine', and the two, decked out in drag while fending off fresh bellboys and dirty old men, are endlessly facing new and hilarious obstacles at every twist in the plot. Lemmon simply shines here, whether he's struggling to keep his masculinity disguised among unsuspecting attractive women or running through the Seminole-Ritz in too-short bellboy trousers and black pumps.I was truly surprised by Marilyn's performance here, too. While her overly-breathy sex kitten persona repels me from most of her films, she was extremely convincing as the sweet, innocent singer in the all-girl band who keeps a flask in her garter and befriends the dynamic duo in drag.'Some Like It Hot' oozes with sexuality without being crass; it achieves almost-constant comedy without degrading itself with lowbrow humor or extreme slapstick; it paces its musical numbers, its storyline gives needed character depth and definition to its protagonists, it balances lighthearted, good-intentioned levity with conscience and grace. Don't let the black-and-white turn you off. 'Some Like It Hot' is a great movie all the way through - this is the kind of film that defines 'rewatchability'. You won't be disappointed.Oh, and aside from Milton Berle, the usually endearing, adorable Jack Lemmon is probably the most hideous woman ever to grace the silver screen.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Steamy but not sleazy and hilarious but not brainless rom-com that mayn't have gained its legendary status without its irresistible cast,"Marilyn Monroe is the greatest proof that an actress can stimulate burning passion among men just by talking; watch those brilliant lips move and those lovely teeth - don't they excite you, tantalize you till you fall off your couch? Monroe should've got those aphrodisiacs patented. Then comes those lovely puppies that adorn her bosom, and they stand out proudly, flaunting their fullness in her revealing gowns. It's a wonder 'Sweet' Sue missed that; everything in Marilyn screams out 'sex!' and Monroe does a feat by layering Sugar with creaminess, nuttiness and sexiness so she's worth much more than those dumb desperate harebrained bimbos. Sugar has a mind and a heart - she may be dumb and gullible, but she's certainly not vain; she doesn't even understand her own eccentricities sometimes, like always falling for bespectacled Saxophone players who only have one thing on their minds. She loves to drink anytime, anywhere and knows she doesn't have much of a voice but can use her charm to please anyone. This makes her unique, and we don't just gawk at them puppies all the time. Marilyn brings steadiness to her role, and she never lets go of Sugar in her scenes, in spite floundering her lines and creating a fiasco on sets. Her 'I want to be loved by you' is candid, hummable and touching. The high key lighting on her makes her ethereal. This is one performance that will not be forgotten. Modern rom-com actresses like Katherine Heigl, Jennifer Aniston and some lesser known ones can't bring such sizzle on screen because they take their characters too lightly - Aniston talks like a female county sheriff while Heigl (though I haven't seen much of her) is very clichéd and dull. Megan Fox unfortunately is too hot to make an impact as a true actress; she's all ogle-ogle.Fortunately, Some Like it Hot isn't a Marilyn vehicle, though she anchors much of the film. There are two equally funny male counterparts who share an enviable chemistry, letting loose punch lines after punch lines. Yes, the movie needs to be watched twice to prick out some jokes that missed your ears while you were laughing. On the second viewing, I heard Jack Lemmon's quip on how women were able to walk with those shaky heels: "" Must be how their body is shaped out"" ( or something like that) he remarks, and our minds then try to imagine those hourglass figures and we realize the naughty humor. I found the cries of the drunken man for more coffee funnier in my second viewing. Every pun, innuendo and running gag makes you laugh, though not fall off your seat like some new comedies. But I like it this way, the same way I adored Ninotchka, City Lights, Singing in the Rain and Awful Truth, because they share a common aim to treat the audience with humor, not only with jokes but also with the chemistry and the balanced narrative. Sometimes when we fall off our seats too often, we are alienated from the story and we only wait for more jokes. When such movies try to evoke sympathy for the characters later, we feel indifferent and disappointed. I specifically point out Bollywood films like Housefull, Priyadarshan film (except Hera Pheri) and the Shreyas Talpade capers that seem to drown their movies with gags, only to bring a spurious tear-jerking moment later. Only one world for those movies: FAIL.The supporting cast comprises of bandmaster Sweet Sue, played by Joan Shawlee, a far from sweet, instead being a rather feared martinet who keeps the pixiesh girls in check but underestimates their wildness. She is also discernible as she does not trust Geraldine and Daphne (Curtis and Lemmon in disguise) and tries to probe them whenever she gets a chance. It's a little surprising neither her character nor Dave Berry's (who plays the band supervisor) get more screen time after Sue quietly instructs Beinstock to keep check on the two. They are the ones who are dropped like a brick, sadly. Then there is the liquor mafia king Spats who, along with his over-sized lawyers, hunts for Lemmon and Curtis' characters after the two witness the gangsters massacring a rival gang. These characters, in Alfred Hitchcock terminology, are simply MacGuffins who make the path for sexy Marilyn to enter and smoke up the screen. Also, had these gangsters not been introduced, the movie wouldn't have had its memorable climax that's proves to be a double-edged sword for our unfortunate guys in drag. Climax in a comedy has to be strong, and a bit of irony helps, for example though Charlie Chaplin's City Lights has a happy ending, the climax and falling action before do not make situations favorable for the tramp, but do make things better for those around him. Had such twists been omitted, the movie would not have gained much reputation with a straightforward climax. Some Like it hot has a terrific climax, and we couldn't have asked for a better one.Tony Curtis' Joe is a selfish, crafty and inconsiderate – he relies on Lemmon's Jerry to gain personal advantage (the booking on dogs being the most trivial example), he makes his partner a puppet to attain Sugar (how smartly he arranges the date between Jerry/Daphne and Osgood), and he ignores the consequences of his deception with Sugar until the very end. But what's most important is that he changes. Poor Jerry on the other hand conceives most of the plans, encounters Sugar first, but gets the second billing in the end because of Joe. His courtship as Daphne with Osgood is the funniest moment in the entire film but then I remember 'Nobody's Perfect!' and I can't decide which is funnier.Some Like it hot, in unbearable Mary Murphy's own words, is on my hot tamale train!",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
This movie is truly funny!,"A movie way ahead of it's time, an actress who is much more thanjust a pretty face and a concept to funny to speak of, ""Some like ithot"" is truly hot.  The cross dressing men, the all women band andthe gang of angry Italians, all contribute to the hilarious anticsthese characters pull.  Between the subjects considered too tabooto talk about  and the amazing on screen chemistry this cast held,""Some like it hot"" surly showed how men can cause so muchtrouble!!Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon play two musicians, that were inthe wrong place at the wrong time.  Forced to flee the state, theyjumped at the opportunity to travel the country with band full ofwomen.  Although these two might have thought trouble was faraway, it was sure to catch up to them.  Between the cross dressingidentities and the crazy shoot outs, a love story unfolds in themiddle of all this chaos, or should I say two love stories.Although many find Marylin Monroe to be the one who sang aprovacitive happy birthday song and had many movies that weren'tso critically acclaimed, she seemed to prove many wrong in thismovie.  ""Some like it hot""  showcased Monroe as quite a funnylady.  Her character seemed to some what reflect Monroe in herreal life.

Excellent entertainment ensues as Curtis and Lemmon become more involved and perplexed in the humorous and romantic entanglements they're placed in. Marilyn Munroe is delectably delightful as the band singer who draws Curtis in with her sensuous and semi-flamboyant charm. Joe E.

And Now for Something Completely Hot,"If you haven't seen Some Like It Hot, well, you're missing out on one heck of a gender-bending extravaganza that would make RuPaul proud, your grandma blush, and Shakespeare question his antics in Twelfth Night! It's like someone tossed a screwball comedy, a gangster flick, and a cross-dressing tutorial into a blender set on ""absurd"", and hit the button with a flourish. This cinematic masterpiece, directed by the legendary Billy Wilder, boasts timeless humor and a zany mix of mistaken identities, absurd situations, and more innuendos than you can handle. It's a proof that dressing in drag isn't just for Halloween - it's for everyone who appreciates a good laugh.With Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon donning dresses faster than a chameleon on a Skittles binge, and Marilyn Monroe sashaying in with more charm than a smooth-talking flamingo, this film is a laugh-so-hard-your-popcorn-falls kind of hilarious. As these jazz guys go from being the Odd Couple to the ""Oddly Dressed"" Couple, it's like they raided Marilyn's closet and found themselves in a game of fashion Russian roulette. Watching them navigate high heels is a bit like witnessing baby giraffes taking their first wobbly steps - you can't help but root for them not to faceplant. Their gender-bending antics are more dazzling than a disco ball, and the finale boat chase is a topsy-turvy ballet of wigs, gags, and Osgood's undying love for Daphne. In a world where the mob is less terrifying than a dress strap malfunction, Some Like It Hot serves up a cocktail of chaos that's shaken, stirred, and garnished with hilarity!",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Nobody is perfect but the trio is close to that (dvd),"At first, i was surprised to see that the movie is in black and white but it's true that it fits well with the period (prohibition) and it helps the subject (transvestism).Contrary of recent movies, the movie is slow paced and takes time in locations (Snowy Chicago, the train, Coronado hotel), which dynamizes the story.If the idea of men playing women is usual today, I think this one is the grandfather of all of them. Its originality is the multiple transvestites and their distinct personalities. Lemon is wonderful as he loses his identity and Curtis is funny as a stiffer lady (and he has something to add belong his TV work in ""The Persuaders"").At last, I see now a complete movie with Marilyn: i think indeed that as she gets older, she wins in appeal. But it's rather her fragile sensibility that opens her the gate of movies pantheon. In all cases, she was really an all-around performer and an excellent singer as well!I don't really think it's the number one comedy of all time because I don't laugh continuously (as in ""Pee Wee"") but it's a timeless classic. A century after, the sincere enthusiasm of the cast is still contagious.A funny thing i discovered with the bonus DVD is that all the promotional pics are fake: it's only Marilyn's head on a double body's but it's expected as she is indeed the ""late"" Marilyn Monroe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

It Was Hot,"When I was in high school, I worked in a local bookstore in the evenings. One day I happened to come upon a book on Marilyn Monroe. Up until that time, I had a vague idea about who she was but I'd never seen a movie of hers or really knew too much about her. While paging through the book, I was astonished at the pure sexual energy that she generated, even in the printed form, in fact it was so raw that I was kinda turned off by it.Around that time I saw that ""Some Like It Hot"" was going to be on TV. I tuned in, trying to fine tune the station (I'm dating myself) and was just able to receive a rather fuzzy picture. I watched in my bedroom and even though the picture quality was very poor, I sat mesmerized. That same sexual energy that Marilyn had in printed form oozed out from my TV set. She had a bright, white, glowing quality to her that just floored me.This movie will always have a special place with me, being the first time I ever heard or saw Marilyn Monroe. After that movie, I was hooked on her for years and years. On a side note, a couple years ago I was able to view her belongings at Christie's auction house. That was the first time I really realized she was real person, and not some confection created by Hollywood.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Nobody's Perfect,"In 1955 Billy Wilder made ""The Seven Year Itch"" with Marilyn Monroe. Although they were an odd couple, their collaboration worked great, so when the star announced that she was interested in a role in the director's new movie Wilder was thrilled.""Some Like It Hot"" is about two unemployed musicians who witness a couple of gunmen shooting dead another gang in Chicago. In order to escape, the musicians, played by Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, dress in women's clothes and join an all-girl jazz band on their way to Miami. There they fall in love with the orchestra's blonde singer, played by Marilyn Monroe.When production began, it turned out that Monroe had brought a whole entourage with her. First of all her husband, playwright Arthur Miller, but also the star's acting coach, Paula Strasberg. And to Billy Wilder's dismay, they all had views on what the film should look like. Each scene had to be reshot dozens of times before everyone was satisfied.Things were not made easier by the fact that Marilyn couldn't memorise her dialogue correctly. In the end an exhausted Billy Wilder had to write down her lines on small pieces of paper that he pinned to the furniture. Still, Wilder struggled on with his awkward star because he understood how much Marilyn Monroe meant for the film to succeed.And he was richly rewarded. ""Some Like It Hot"" was a great triumph, at the box office and among critics. Billy Wilder went on to collaborate with Jack Lemmon in six more successful pictures. Tony Curtis had also developed a liking for being the funny guy. He continued to make comedies throughout the '60s. But for Marilyn it was a different story. She only made two other movies before a massive overdose ended her life. Marilyn Monroe was just 36 years old.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Jon Monsarrat review: still funny, but not the top","I was pleasantly surprised by Some Like It Hot. Men in drag is an overdone topic (maybe it wasn't back then?), black and white films are passe, and the passing of 45 years can kill a lot of old films... for example, North By Northwest. No offense, but action and special effects have come a long way since Hitchcock. But Some Like It Hot is still funny, although not the kind of funny that I'd give to the top 250 films of all time. It outdoes TV's ""Bosom Buddies"" but it's not as funny as classics ""The Ref"", ""My Cousin Vinny"", ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"", or ""Freaky Friday"".Tony Curtis is great, Jack Lemmon is OK, and I was disappointed by Marilyn Monroe. Apparently there are rumors that she stumbled through her role and I believe it 100%. This is the first film with her I've seen and, maybe it's the outdated hair style or the cancerous mole, I wasn't particularly attracted to her.Who should see this film:-- Comedy lovers with an interest in the classics, this one's safe.-- Film artistes, but you may be disappointed.I prefer to give a rating for how a film plays today, not when it was first released.

Hot! Hot! Hot!,"Dazzling comedy from Maestro Billy Wilder. Only Hitchcock of Wilder's Hollywood directing contemporaries can claim to have had better output in the 50's as classics like ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""The Seven Year Itch"", ""Witness For The Prosecution"" and my favourite ""Ace In The Hole"" all attest. This was his last film of the decade and an absolute triumph it is.Wilder somehow knew how to get the best out of Marilyn Monroe as he amply demonstrates here, the actress giving a performance which is sexy, sassy and sympathetic, but most of all side-splittingly funny. There's never a sense you're laughing at her, always with her, while as a bonus you get her best vampy style rendition of ""I Wanna Be Loved By You"". It's her picture for sure but she plays great against her two, I hesitate to say, straight men in the form of Messrs Curtis and Lemmon.You have to love the way both these well-established male starring actors throw themselves into their parts, with not even a hint of artifice in their dragging up. The dialogue throughout is razor-sharp, with many a quip raising an eyebrow at the same time as a laugh.I don't know which pairing in the film is the funnier, Lemmon's Daphne gradually succumbing to the tireless pursuit of elderly millionaire Joe E Brown or Curtis reverse-seducing Monroe on the borrowed yacht from Brown. Don't forget either the nostalgic casting of George Raft and Pat O'Brien stepping into their old spats one more time.The chemistry between the three leads is nigh on perfect while lovers of 30's and 40's screwball comedy, where Wilder got his start of course, will smile knowingly at the numerous in-jokes referencing past classics of the genre, most obviously Curtis's hilarious homage to Cary Grant, with whom in fact he'd worked on a movie (""Operation Petticoat"") only the year before.

"This is a hugely successful buddy comedy that has never really made it into my ""favorites"", even though it has a lot going for it.","This is a film that I want to like more than I actually do. It centers around two musicians, who witness a mob hit and go on the run. Joe and Jerry are down on their luck bass and saxophone players and they end up going on the run with an all female band who travel via train to Florida for a holiday gig at a fancy hotel. In order to get the job they not only have to pose as women...Josephine and Daphne, but they have to keep up the ruse.There is so much to love about this film...a lot of the dialogue is wonderfully comedic, but the true comedy was in the visuals (aka non-verbals) for me...like the scene where they arrive at the hotel to a porch lined with rich tycoons in rocking chairs, hysterical! Speaking of the beachside hotel...it was stunning and an excellent backdrop for this movie. Far from being in Florida it was the California hotel, Hotel del Coronado, and it is spectacular in it's opulence. The train trip plays a major role in the film and from a historical perspective it was neat to see the sleeping berth, etc. George Raft's entrance as Spats Colombo was a visual master course...from his white spats to his fedora, he screamed gangster, and from the positioning of his entourage he is clearly the boss. As a woman, I equal parts appreciated and loathed the ruse used by Joe to get Sugar to make the moves on him. I enjoyed the character of Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown) tremendously...and he created my favorite thing about this film which is the closing lines:
""I'm a man!""-Daphne
""Nobody's perfect.""- OsgoodThe names used throughout were great, I particularly like Sugar Kane...I have used the pseudonym Candy Kane frequently since hearing it years ago. The chemistry between the two friends played by Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon fantastic, they make you really believe that they are the best of friends. My favorite character however is the bold and brazen bellhop, in appropriate...but it still makes me laugh."" I guess some like it hot, I prefer classical!""""If I were a girl, and I am.""""The omelette is about to hit the fan!""""We can eat nothing but bananas, we can live for a million years.""And my second favorite line...
""According to my tax advisor she's only soso-but that's the way the oil gushes.""Now for a comment on Marilyn's two performance dresses...thanks to the lighting and how the numbers were shot it appears exceptionally scandalous and by that I mean that both in the white dress and the back one she looks like she is topless with pasties on. I imagine this appeals to a certain set, but to be honest it almost felt out of place in this ""buddy comedy"". Marilyn is sexy enough with her exaggerated movements and laid on thick sultry voice, she did not need to appear practically naked to add the necessary sex appeal. The white dress didn't even appear to be properly zipped up in the back, I later read that Marilyn was pregnant during the filming...so it's possible that that is the reason and that her dress actually wasn't zipped up, which makes sense. It's kind of sad that her costume wasn't comfortable enough without that, but maybe it was a last minute adjustment.Again this film has a lot to recommend it but somehow never completely sits right with me, which always keeps it out of my favorites. I do think it is a classic film must see, so you will have to be your own determiner. Maybe it will hit the right note with you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Early Cross-Dressers,"I was 11 years old when this film was made, and I remember bunking in to our local cinema in London to see it!I'd been smitten by Marilyn a couple of years before after accidentally seeing her in the easily forgettable Prince And the Showgirl when my family went to the movies on a wet holiday afternoon in Ramsgate! I got the idea of the men dressing as women, in order to escape mob execution, but to discover at the end one of them was prepared to go through with the charade in order to ""marry"" a rich playboy, who'd been quite taken with him/her, I was disgusted! I now have this movie in my library at home and have watched it enough times to form the impression that these two guys actually enjoyed their predicament! I recall watching another film made in the same era, where Tony Curtis played a slave to the Laurence Olivier Roman nobleman, in which the latter was explaining that some people like oysters and some like snails, but it was possible to like both! Was this just a subtle attempt to tell the public, it's OK to live in both worlds? Even so, this was quite a presentable show piece, and was all the better for displaying the delightful Marilyn Monroe, who would've lit up any boring script.For this I give 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
hot stuff and dumb people.,"Some like it hotSome like it hot is by far one of the most twistedly funny movies of all time. Though it is not apparent, a person has to be sharp in order to catch it. Marilyn Monroe did a damn good job of playing the part of a dumb blond (that is to say she was actually acting). In any case this was thoroughly amusing. With the mobsters chasing those two transvestites. And the one guy chasing Monroe's character. And the other guy being chased by the millionaire who thinks he is a woman.This movie sucked. It was utterly ridiculous. What is the likelihood of a group of women not being able to tell the difference between another woman and two men dressed in women's clothing? This reviewer has seen a few transvestites and it does not take much to be able to look at someone and say whether are not that is a woman or a well dressed man in women's clothing'. That is to say he looks more like a woman than a man does, but is still unmistakably a man, especially in the scene where they go swimming. Now how does that work? The point is that this movie was unbelievable.That is why this movie receives a ratting of five out of ten.",5.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

I believe the cast list could have been quite different for all sorts of reasons but as far as I am concerned the people who were involved conspired to produce a perfect comedy. I would recommend anyone watch this film and as long as nobody takes it too seriously I an convinced that most people will find it as funny as myself and numerous other people have. I would advise the person that is watching it for the first time just relax, tune in to the humour level and pay attention because there are a lot of visual and vocal subtleties. Even if the humour doesn't appeal I suspect the most hard nosed critic will at least accept that it is a superb creation.

a true comedy classic and one of the best films I have ever seen,"So I watched the film classic from 1959 ""some like it hot"". Let me describe the movie in simple terms; what happens when you take a pure B movie plot, add great dialog, superb acting, and near perfect direction from a Hollywood legend, well you get pure comic gold. This is one of those movies you hope they never remake. It is now more than 50 years since this Billy Wilder gem was made and its stands the test of time. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are perfectly cast as two down on their luck musicians who are on the run from the mob. They take a gig as female band members in order to get out of town and hilarity ensues. The dialog between them is fantastic and they sell every line that would probably be real cheesy if delivered by almost anyone else. Marilyn Monroe is well HOT. This is my first Marilyn Monroe movie and well I get it now. I always saw pictures of her and said o.k shes a babe but, man there really was just something about her. My favorite lines in the movie are in the very last scene. I won't spoil it for the possible one person who reads this someday, but man I almost peed myself.

"""Wait for Sugar!""","After ranting in my West Side Story write-up about how certain movies cry out to be experienced in an actual movie theatre (although I did conclude that West Story Story can be appreciated on a smaller screen), I decided to write about another classic movie that actually is enhanced by the smaller-screen experience: Billy Wilder's 1959 comedy gem, Some Like It Hot.I did get to see this in a movie theatre in Hollywood a few years back (with excellent popcorn!), and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a beautifully executed piece, in all ways: The plot moves along briskly, the situations are exploited for all they're worth without ever descending into heavy-handedness, and Monroe, Curtis and Lemmon show the world why they became Movie Stars of the highest calibre - their characterizations are flawless, their comedic timing impeccable, and Curtis looks gorgeous in drag, let's face it.At home, on the smaller screen, this film plays amazingly well. The intimacy level is higher, of course, and you're easily drawn into the delightful story without feeling as if you're watching something horrifically dated, which I do feel with most films made before the '70s, say. The great Billy Wilder wrote and directed some fantastic movies in his career, and Some Like It Hot is right up there, at the pinnacle.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Ahead of its time,"Directed by Billy Wilder and starring Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, this comedy follows two musicians (Curtis and Lemmon) during the Prohibition Era. The two friends have to flee for their lives after they attract the attention of gangsters in the worst way possible. The solution? Pull on a dress and join an all-female band headed for Florida. What else? Things start to derail when they lay eyes on Sugar (Monroe) and become instantly smitten.Some Like It Hot has topped more than one list as the best comedy ever made. And yes, there is some truth to that. It is a very good comedy. Especially given its age.It has been said that the pinnacle of humour is a dude in drag. And here we have two. The film was made near the end of the so called Hays Code era. This list of rules set very strict rules for what could be shown on screen and what kind of stories could be told, but towards its end these rules were not as ardently enforced. Still, I can imagine that this film was something of a game changer. Men in drag, Monroe's many many curves flashing all around, and plenty of jokes about flirting, fooling women, homosexuality and about how insulted the two main characters are when they're objectified while posing as women.The film is sixty years old now, and while it was very progressive when it came out, it suffers from the gender stereotypes of its day. I don't believe you would see a modern film where Monroe's character was lead around quite so blatantly. Or at the very least it wouldn't be shown as something quite as acceptable.Well okay, they definitely could make a film with such a plot nowadays, but it wouldn't be seen as one of the greatest films ever made. It would have to fight to reach a B-movie status.And that's the great divide of this film. If you believe that films (or any art, really) shouldn't be given a pass for giving offense because of its age, then this is not a movie for you. It has a wide misogynistic streak. But, if you're willing to accept that it was made in the middle of the last century and that despite its best intentions, it does show some bias when it comes to gender roles, then I'd say that it is a very well written, acted and directed movie that will definitely stay with you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Just an honest opinion,"I don't find this movie extremely funny, after several viewings. It always seems too long for this kind of material. Though the great skills of Billy Wilder, I. A. L Diamond and the actors are in play, it's just a little too much of a good thing at times. Specifically for the actors: I find Tony Curtis without fault (even if his ""Josephine"" voice had to be dubbed), Jack Lemmon overdoes his ""Daphne"" character too often, and Marilyn Monroe---though what see of her in the film is mostly pretty good--I find the character annoying, and it's hard not to think about the terrible stress she brought to the production. I understand that, since they had her for the movie they wanted to maximize her time onscreen, so she gets three songs. Yes this is a farce, and that means the kind of very broad humor we see. Nothing wrong with that, just a matter of taste. Love the final scene though.",5.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Well, nobody's perfect!","Oh, what an utterly delightful movie! From shootouts to car chases and cross-dressing, this film has something for everyone!Set in 1929, Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) are musicians in an illegal jazz club. They manage to slip out during a police raid, but soon after find themselves on the run after witnessing a mob killing.Desperate for cash, an opportunity arises for them to play in a band - only, it is a women's band for women only. Fearing for the mob, they grab the opportunity, disguise themselves as women and join the band. (So, even back in 1959 they found an excuse to put men in dresses!) And so they head to Miami on a train along with the all-female band.On the train, they meet Sugar Kane Kowalczyk, who is hoping to find a millionaire in Miami (oh, just call her a gold digger already!). Joe - now known as Josephine - and Jerry - now known as Daphne - both become smitten with Sugar, but know they don't stand a chance. Many hilarious moments ensue on the train. The 'private party' was hilarious and so much fun!!Needless to say, more hilarity were to follow once they reach Miami. 'Some like it hot' is a genuinely funny movie, with seriously funny - and clever - dialogue! I absolutely loved the characters and the performances. Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis were fantastic in their respective roles. Despite a much smaller role, Joe E. Brown was also stunning as millionaire Osgood Fielding III. I so enjoyed this character, who happened to utter that hilarious last line in the movie!Although cross-dressing was an almost taboo subject in movies in the 50's, the film's enormous success proved the timing was right, and surely this must have been viewed as refreshingly new at the time.

"A classic, charming movie.","I'm usually not much for old comedies, although i have to say, this one was truly original, cheerful characters that created the comic impression throughout the movie, which made me grin all the way through. Tony Curtis is an entertaining actor to observe, pulling off three different characters in one movie is nothing more but impressive and shows that he is a very adjustable person. Marilyn Monroe who played 'Sugar Kane Kowalczyk', to me seemed to be very suitable for the character itself, she lived through the character as if it was a part of herself.Billy Wilder took such good care of this film, able to display excitement, love and comedy all together, the synchronization among all the cast on what could have been very chaotic couple of scenes if not done correctly, but manage to control this exceptionally. The shooting location and the backgrounds gave it a very comfortable awareness which made it feel like a cup of hot coco on a cold winter day.

The Greatest American Comedy And One Of Wilder's Best,"""Some Like It Hot"" is ranked number one on the American Film Institute's Top 100 Laughs; making the film basically the funniest movie of all-time. Yet, I couldn't refrain from asking myself if this movie really deserves the number one spot, or even ""Tootsie"" at number two; perhaps there IS something about transvestitism that appeals to the general public, mind you, if they're done skillfully. I feel I'm in no position to argue. With that said this delightful comedy has a little something for everyone to enjoy.After being nearly arrested for entertaining in an illegal backdoor dive and gambling club two musicians named Joe and Jerry, played by Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, flee the scene and quickly start looking for jobs elsewhere. After hearing that a certain opening is available for a saxaphone and bull fiddle player Jerry tries to convince an agent that he and Joe can qualify for the engagement -- the only catch is that they have to be women. Joe refuses the idea and suggests the alternative and play at a dance located 100 miles out-of-town. In an effort to provide themselves with transportation Joe charms his way with a woman to borrow her car located at a parking garage. While there Joe and Jerry witness a mob massacre; narrowly escaping death themselves. In fear of their lives the two flee the state, joining an all-girl band masquerading as women and head out by bus to Florida.During this bus ride the two men encounter an attractive blonde named Sugar Kane Kowalczyk, played by a voluptuous, then pregnant Marilyn Monroe. From the very first meeting she comes across as a not particularly bright, bottle-sipping ukulele player who wants nothing more but to marry a nice, kind man with lots of money -- like a millionaire with glasses. As the story progresses Joe takes a fancy to Sugar and funny complications ensue. The band eventually arrive in Florida, and Joe and Jerry, now calling themselves Josephine and Daphne, instead of fleeing on arrival decide to play out their stint at a hotel lounge. Meanwhile, Joe attempts to win the affection of Sugar while pretending to be an English millionaire equipped with glasses and a yacht. But their amusing absurdities come to a halt when the mob from Chicago, headed by Spats Colombo (George Raft), catches up with them by odd chance at the same hotel.There are two reasons why ""Some Like It Hot"" works and why so few of the same kind of movies that followed have been a success. 1) The cast. In addition to the superb character actors, Pat O'Brien and Joe E. Brown, you just can't go wrong with Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis and Marilyn Monroe. The two men play off each other so well and they're a delight to watch. And to top it off you have Marilyn Monroe, in what I've always considered was the last triumph in her film career before making her final picture, ""The Misfits"", a year or so later. 2) Billy Wilder as director. Wilder has such a strong ability for comedy on screen it is unparalleled, HE is unparalleled; watch any or all of this man's movies and you'll understand why he's considered one of the greatest filmmakers of the 20th century. Presently, ""Some Like It Hot"" is working on being nearly 60 years old, and it doesn't seem dated one bit.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

One of Curtis' best films... and an effective and enjoyable comedy.,"For many, this movie is simply one of the greatest comedies of all time. However, I have serious doubts about that. In my personal opinion, it's a good comedy, it entertains its audience very well, and there's no doubt about its status as a movie classic. Starting from this reasonable basis and placing the film at the heights as the best or one of the best already seems unreasonable and exaggerated. But that's just what I think.The script is set during the Prohibition, a time when speakeasies were one of the biggest sources of financial income for mobsters. The script starts from this context and creates an interesting and reasonably well-written story, where two jazz musicians end up becoming witnesses to a massacre, in which a group of mobsters kills a rival group in Chicago. This, of course, was inspired by a true, very famous incident, the Valentine's Day Massacre. Persecuted and in life danger, they decide to dress up as two women and hide, like members of a female jazz orchestra that takes a train to the coast, to perform in a hotel. Of course, then the funniest part of the movie begins, with the characters trying to keep the cover-up amid the romantic shenanigans that unfold.In addition to a good script and good dialogue, the film has very good performances by Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, the two great male protagonists. For me, this is one of the most interesting films of both their careers, and it's great to see the way they both played together. I also liked the works of George Raft and Joe E. Brown, which gives soul and grace to the end, very famous and funny. Pat O'Brien also does a good job, even if he doesn't follow his peers closely. But the film was probably better known to audiences thanks to the female star, Marilyn Monroe. But I don't like her work here. She was an extraordinary singer, and her best scenes are the ones where she sings... but I never thought of her as a good and talented actress (she couldn't even memorize what she had to say, and the director practically swore that would never work with her again): and, really, her performance in the film is irritating, turning the character into a sly young woman and something of an idiot.The film doesn't make a big bet on the technical aspects, but it offers us high quality sets and costumes, good effects and an effective soundtrack. From the beginning, it takes on a pleasant rhythm that allows the two hours of duration to pass without us noticing. It also features good cinematography, with a regular filming job that makes the best use of selected filming locations.",4.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

The bold masterpiece to put Marilyn Monroe in screen history,"How unbelievably historical are the scenes in which Marilyn Monroe, playing Sugar Kane Kowalczyk, a struggling singer looking for love and a good life, sings those beautiful love ballads; first time standing in front of her band and second time, sitting on the side of a piano, confessing she is ""through with love""--both times so real and so timeless.She is such a cynical character, but she is a timeless work of art, her flamboyancy befitting perfectly among the likes of equally cynical characters, from the mobster Spats Colombo (George Raft) and his circle, to Detective Mulligan (Pat O'Brien) who is pursuing justice for his ego--and then, of course, Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) the two musicians on the run, disguised as the opposite sex. Billy Wilder created a world filled with characters who are all looking for primordial things: Mulligan, for instance, loves taunting the mobsters he is investigating, as he throws his cigar in their face and yelling in the mobsters' big boss hearing device--how he would love to nail them, only to feel smarter.But the main boldness of this film is the sex shape-shifting of its two lead characters, Joe and Jerry, as they struggle to survive and adapt to the habits of the opposite sex like, you know, going into the correct (or incorrect) bathroom. Yet by keeping the act rolling and by hiding its liberal views, this film shines through its comedic genius. There is a rhythm to everything. The characters, while uneducated, are smart, witty and quick to answer. Comedic timing is on point; there are dozens of techniques, characters and scenarios which I recognize and are attempted to be remade even in today's comedies.There is a scene in which Joe, disguised as a millionaire and acting as a subtle parody to Cary Grant, attempts to win Sugar over. He lies about having a yacht and how he will take her there and whatnot. These characters live in the moment and flow with an incredible freedom and precision. In this scene, he and Sugar change lines on the spot: ""Look, if you're interested in whether I am married or not...""; ""Oh, I'm not interested at all.""; ""Well, I'm not.""; ""That's very interesting"" Sugar closes with an eager smile.Billy Wilder made a mess of unorthodox characters, all driven by Darwinist senses: Joe and Jerry claim to be pals looking out for each other, but as they get closer to Sugar, they constantly try to out-smart each other to win her, while Sugar is straight-up: ""I want a millionaire"" and she admits she is not very bright. Watching this film, you get the feeling they could be caught at any time, and I will not spoil the ending, but I will tell you that the ending line is what truly seals this film's place on the pantheon of greatness. I will not tell you what it is, but it completely makes you wonder whether Joe and Jerry were playing the joke on everyone else or the other way around--and if so, did anyone care?""Some Like It Hot"" is one of those masterpieces which will be remembered for how great of a comedy it is and not much more; but the scenes with Marylin Monroe are of an inviting sexuality--all dressed in glamour, presentable, yet igniting primordial thoughts. These are characters whose motives change to what brings them immediate pleasure, forget the consequences, he can find out that I am a man after the wedding! What's the big deal, anyway?",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Wilder's Broad Comedy is Hilarious.,"I more strongly prefer the masterly noir work of Billy Wilder, (I find his comedies forced with equal amounts of hit or miss humor) but Some Like It Hot is one comedy that excels on many levels. The script crackles with wit, there's plenty of slapstick and about half a dozen classic film moments.Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are out of work musicians whose luck takes another downward turn when they witness the St. Valentines Massacre. They take it on the lamb, adopting female identities and hook up with an all women band who has a sweet gig in Miami. The plan is to just get out of Chicago and away from the mob. Miami however does not prove to be a safe haven.Lemmon and Curtis are a perfect comedy team in Hot, superior to any of Lemmon's many teamings with Matthau. Lemmon's tendency to over act is evident in the early moments but once in drag it becomes pitch perfect. Curtis has never been funnier whether he's vamping it or doing his atrocious Cary Grant and the two acting styles work well as they comically frustrate each other from start to finish. Marilyn Monroe never was much of an actress but here she exudes the ultimate dumb blonde stereotype that creates the legend.There's a certain burlesque and stereotype to Wilder's work certainly evidenced in the buxom presence of Monroe and broad portrayals of Italian gangsters ( George Raft)Irish cops (Pat O'Brien) along with Keystone Cop chases that come across a little fatigued. O'Brien is hardly on screen and Raft had long ceased to ever be capable of acting and was no longer menacing. Joe E. Brown as an aging playboy more than makes up for the rest of the lackluster supporting cast courting Lemmon with hilarious nonchalance and along with the two male leads delivers Wilder and I.A. Diamonds snappy dialog with maximum comic effect.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"God, I love this film.","Quite simply one of the funniest films ever made. The script is a masterpiece carried off exquisitely by Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon and Marilyn Monroe.

Only 8/10?! I must have been insane when I wrote this! That's too low!,"""Some Like it Hot"" has a ridiculous plot and even though it works out to some really great comedic moments that might throw you off. The movie takes some getting used to but once you embrace it, it's pretty funny. It has a lot of memorable moments and good, very quotable lines that you've definitely heard before (though you may not know it) so if you're a film fan you owe yourself to see this one. It's light as a feather when it isn't full of mobsters gunning each other down so it's sure to bring a smile to your face on even the worst day. If you're a fan of Marilyn Monroe (or if you're curious as to why she still has so many fans) this one is an absolute must because she is absolutely beautiful in the picture. She also happens to give a pretty good performance and the duo of Tony Curtis/Jack Lemmon is great too. I never really saw why people were so excited about Marilyn Monroe until I saw this movie. She is ridiculously hot here that after seeing her the one time, I became an instant fan. ""Some Like it Hot"" also happens to have one of the best final closing lines in Hollywood history so check it out. (Dvd, August 29, 2012)",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

"""Cinderella the Second""","What is it about the comedies written and directed by Billy Wilder that made them so endlessly watchable? Well, the short answer is of course that they are bloody funny. For a longer answer, read on First off let's look at screenplays. Some Like it Hot was Wilder's first collaboration IAL Diamond, after years without a consistent partner-in-crime. Neither man is entirely responsible for the fresh brilliance of this picture, but it seems in bouncing ideas they were able to feed off each others' abilities. The general style of comedy is very much Wilder's – the mix of plausible situation and outright farce, the elaborate visual gags derived from Ernst Lubitsch – but it seems likely that Diamond brought in a tighter and more disciplined angle, no doubt adding a joke or two of his own along the way. But what's great about this screenplay (and what makes the picture so continually engaging) is the way it progresses through different types of humour.So, we open with a setting that is fairly familiar from classic gangster movies – a speakeasy, a Tommy-gun shootout – but with a sprinkling of jokes of a by-the-way nature. We get things like the organ stop being a secret way of opening the speakeasy door – little irreverent twists on hackneyed clichés – and the reason they work so well is because of how nonchalantly they are presented. It's a great way to set the tone and keep the laughs coming without making things too riotous at this early stage. Then, when the cross-dressing antics begin, Wilder and Diamond are able to milk a good half-hour's worth of gags purely out of the awkwardness and potential pitfalls of their situation. But if the entire rest of the movie were simply a load of jokes about blokes in dresses, it would eventually get repetitive. Therefore, when we arrive in Florida the whole thing spirals into a farcical free-for-all, complete with a couple of resident oddballs who make the two leading ""ladies"" seem normal by comparison.Speaking of the leads, it really is impossible to imagine anyone other than Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon as Josephine and Daphne. Curtis, that rugged and mean-faced man of action, makes a surprisingly good woman, in both looks and mannerisms. Lemmon is great too but there is more of the outrageous comedy drag look about him. It's a pity Curtis couldn't do the voice and had to be dubbed, otherwise I think he would have been in line for an Oscar nomination too. And this is incidentally the role for which Marilyn Monroe won a Golden Globe. Yes, her reputation now may be as a dumb blonde sex object, but in her day it was acknowledged that she could act. And this is just about her best performance, because it's the one part of hers that makes you forget that reputation, and just see the woman.But it's the supporting players that keep this one chirpy, especially towards the end of the picture where all bets are off and things are allowed to get completely silly. Rubber-faced Joe E. Brown is at the heart of the farce, so perfectly exaggerated in his looks and manner, like a cartoon character made flesh. And when the gangster subplot resurfaces, the authentic but somewhat ordinary George Raft will no longer do as chief baddie – the comedy game has been raised since then. So instead we get Nehemiah Persoff doing a very credible and entertaining Mussolini impersonation. And what about that creepy bellhop? Al Breneman, apparently. Where did they find that kid? He's brilliant! For movie buffs who have become familiar with this and later Billy Wilder comedies, it seems strange to think that before Some Like It Hot he was largely known as a writer and director of grim and cynical dramas. It appeared now though that he had hit upon a formula he felt happy with, and for whatever reason was compelled to put that pessimistic past behind him. His partnership with IAL Diamond was to last for the rest of their respective careers, during which they would make only one non-comedy. However, while they penned a number of a real classics together, they never quite equalled the box of delights that is Some Like It Hot.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A comedic masterpiece,"One of the most widely loved comedies of all-time, Some Like it Hot is a film deserving of its high standing among the critic and audience circles as renowned director Billy Wilder crafts a wild comedic outing that had the dream pairing of Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis to go along with one of starlet Marilyn Monroe's most iconic performances.With the stars well and truly aligning for this tale of Lemmon and Curtis's musician's for hire Jerry and Joe going undercover as a pair of female band members to escape mobsters that want them dead after they witnessed an organised hit, only to have matters complicated by the fact they both fall in love with Monroe's simple yet alluring fellow band mate Sugar, Hot is a relatively straight-forward fish out of water comedy that thrives off smart script work and execution and the powerful presence of its main trio.All well-known and loved for their abilities to light up the screen and elevate material to the next level, Wilder lets his performers really run with Hot's over the top story and frenetic pacing that even by today's standards is filled with regularly occurring zingers, innuendos and awkward moments that are all wonderfully realized, whether they be high-brow, low-brow or somewhere in between.In particular its a pure cinematic joy to watch Lemmon and Curtis go toe for toe as they try and navigate their new surroundings and do their best to be lady like even though the alluring and seductive Sugar is there at all moments to unknowingly try and thwart their grand plans to evade the mob by becoming a whole new person and gender and as they get further and further into the situation they find themselves in, the banter and interplay between the two esteemed actors only grows stronger.In the midst of all of this however is Hot's true trump card, that being Monroe who is at the peak of her powers as Sugar, a somewhat dimwitted alcoholic who means well and only wants to get by in the crazy world she finds herself in, Monroe perfectly plays out Sugar's arc and features in a number of Hot's iconic scenes that includes a glorious train-held band practice and some highly intense romantic interludes with Curtis later on.Final Say -A true joy of a film that is another wonderful addition to Billy Wilder's iconic filmography, Some Like it Hot is an all-time great comedy that also acts as some of its casts best and most entertaining pieces of work.4 1/2 pairs of high heels out of 5",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Two musicians are on the run from mobsters dressed as women,"SOME LIKE IT HOT ( rating, * * * * * out of 5 )Two out of work musicians (Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis) witness the St Valentine's Day Massacre and escape to Miami disguised as girl musicians. They both fall for the sultry ukulele player (Marilyn Monroe) and go to extraordinary lengths to win her heart - but dressed as unattractive women, this proves to be a little difficult.Writer/director Billy Wilder with help from scriptwriter I. A. L Diamond, shape this breakthrough comedy with a new set of rules and structure. Wilder combines transvestitism, sexual chaos, slapstick mayhem, and all with sinless innocent.Jack Lemmon is inspired with his faultless comedy-timing and when needed, a sense of the dramatic. Tony Curtis is sufficiently dashing but as a criticism, (the only one this movie warrants) the on-screen chemistry with Marilyn Monroe is non existent. The couple didn't get on behind the scenes and this translates to the final product.Marilyn Monroe plays Marilyn Monroe beautifully which is exactly what the script requires and even though she was a tad overweight, she still manages to set hearts a fluttering and to sizzle with sensual vim and vigor.'Some Like It Hot' bounces from one hilarious situation to the other with a succession of genuine belly laughs. The double-entendres are about as subtle as a pie in the face but this is tempered with a slightly black edge to the comedy.With George Raft, Joe E. Brown and Pat O'Brien lurking in the background, this movie is to be cherished and absolutely delighted in. Billy Wilder made some impressive comedies, 'Sabrina', 'The Apartment', and 'The Seven Year Itch', but it's 'Some Like It Hot' that shines the brightest.Even up against comedy contemporaries and in glorious black and white, this 1959 treasure glows like a neon beacon. At the end of the day it's gifted writing and ingenious application that makes a movie great. Billy Wilder had these talents is spades and they all come together perfectly in 'Some Like It Hot'.Copyright:  Cameron Koo, April 1996",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"A fresh, breezy ride","This is not about just Marilyn Monroe. She does cast a spell with her sublime and appeal; no breaking news here! In addition, the movie is about a story of two musicians– Joe, the sax player (Tony Curtis) and Jerry, the bass player (Jack Lemmon).In the era of bootlegging in 1929, Joe and Jerry live in Chicago, struggling to make their ends meet. Small, infrequent performances and Joe's manipulative charm on ladies see them through the day's end, until they find a gold mine of an opportunity to perform in a hotel in an all paid trip to Florida. The only concern is, they have to pose themselves as women. Some disappointments, some rejections and 7 murders later they agree to take the job. And then, unrolls the bundle of fun, music, adventure, poolside frolics and a visual treat that is Sugar Cane (Marilyn Monroe).Joe and Jerry, both very nimble characters, bring to life a beautiful, comic camaraderie which drives the plot of the entire movie. Sugar is an innocent, aspiring singer who fits perfectly in the scheme of love, sensuality, comedy and chaos.Although having seen umpteenth similar comedies that came after this, 'Some like it hot' still seems fresh, witty, genre-defining and worth all the accolades it has gathered all these years. I watched it and understood why this movie is immortal- because it has been inspiring comedies ever since 1959.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"""Well, nobody's perfect!""","SOME LIKE IT HOT is a tasteful blend between a hilarious comedy, an unconvincing romance, and a parody of crime. The story is very simple, with some universal themes. It is interesting to see so many different characters, which complement each other, in one film.Two friends and musicians flee from Chicago, because they have witnessed a massacre. They are persecuted by dangerous gangsters. The only salvation for the two of them is a female music group, that is traveling by train to Florida. They disguise themselves as women and join the band. However, it is not easy to be a man, who is disguised as a woman...Mr. Wilder has managed to spin a good joke at the expense of American girls' lust, madness in high society and parodies on crime, which have marked the thirties of the last century in America. There are not many films which develop nice and pleasant romance from a little nasty joke. A funny disguise, caricature of mafia, naive rich men and silly blondes offer good fun, but do not guarantee a good movie.The protagonists are, what is almost incredible, very complex characters, which are torn between crucial issues of life, mentality and lifestyle. They, through a hilarious adventure, are rushing toward a trivial goal. The essence is in a series of meaningless and futile attempts, which were aided by the opportunism and escapism.Black and white technique is a big hit in this case. Scenery exudes with a certain charm. Makeup and costumes are not too showy. The soundtrack is very good.Marilyn Monroe as Sugar ""Kane"" Kowalczyk is a ukulele player and singer. She is a very simple character who has complex problems, which involve an escape from a saxophonist and hunt for a young and helpless millionaire. Ms. Monroe, besides deliberately infantile voice and enchanting stature, has showed, for the umpteenth time, a talent for comedy. Tony Curtis as Joe/""Josephine""/""Shell Oil Junior"" is a poor saxophone player. He is a serious and somewhat calculating character. His vocal imitation of a big movie star is more than interesting. He is everything that Sugar wants and all that which she escapes.Jack Lemmon as Jerry (Gerald)/""Daphne"", is a double bass player. He's a bit silly character, who wants to escape from reality at all costs. Each new opportunity or possibility, like a boomerang, returs him to the uncertainty. His support is Joe E. Brown (Osgood Fielding III) as an old and perverted millionaire.Frequent crafts, through hilarious scenes of escape, midnight tango, or an excellent punchline at the end of the film, bring a tremendous amount of laughter and fun.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Great fun - a great film!,"This is one of my favourite films. Great for rainy day watching. They don't make 'em like this anymore!Just watched Some Like it Hot again after a long gap (15+ years). I have to say that on this viewing - I see it slightly differently now. But it's still great film: funny and entertaining.All the three main players are excellent. Marylin Monroe is at her best. She is natural, charming and very funny. I believe her performance here is something like the real person: Norma Jean. That's my theory anyway.Jack Lemmon is earnest as Jerry/Daphne, and gives an hilarious performance dating & dancing with the oddball playboy Joe E. Brown as Osgood Fielding III.Tony Curtis as Joe/Josephine/Shell Oil Junior, gives one of his best ever performances, carrying THREE characters expertly. His comic timing and persona are first class.We get a sense of 1929 here, with cars, costume and interiors all finely recreated - and of course - beautifully filmed in black & white.We already know that Billy Wilder was one of THE great screenplay writers and directors. Some Like it Hot shows his great versatility even with comedy and farce. (See also my review for People on Sunday)Watching Some Like it Hot again makes me realise that it is actually a bit too silly. The ending sections are a bit too farcical. This brings it off a 10/10 rating.I love stories that move a long way - and this certainly does that. Some Like it Hot also contains some subversive observations: about how women are/were seen: their ""roles"", at least in America in the 1950's. Monroe is set up as the icon, but all three main characters get chased by men in some respect or another. Both Curtis as Joe and Lemmon as Jerry are woman chasers - fairly overtly. But part of the fun of the film is watching the interplay of these two playing women - surrounded by other young women!There are other subtle views Wilder makes that are to do with his observations of American 1950s society. Wilder spent the first 28 years of his life in Europe - so he would be well placed to see what Americans around him could not.One observation is the obviously very high body count! In a comedy!? Clearly, American audiences were quite used to gangsters in movies, shooting, bodies, implied and actual threat. Set up as dramatic tension, but it's hiding in plain sight here. This also detracts a little.So, Some Like it Hot is funny, entertaining as a comedy farce, but slightly flawed.The film winds to a very memorable final scene: ""Nobody's perfect""....Perhaps this is what Wilder was trying to say all along???",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

"The true definition of the word ""classic""","When 2 musicians witness a mob-hit in Chicago, they flee the city under the guise of 2 female musicians in an all-girl band who are heading to Florida. Complications ensue when Jerry (or Daphne as he becomes known) gets some unwanted attention from a lecherous millionaire. Whereas Joe (under the name of Josephine) is doing everything he can to impress fellow band member Sugar (under the guise of a gentile frigid millionaire). This proves to be the least of their problems when the gangsters from Chicago eventually manage to track them down...I've seen Some Like It Hot too many times to count, but it's one of those films that still rewards the viewer with each passing viewing. Although rewatching a classic is never going to quite hit home in the same way as it does on the first viewing, Some Like It Hot still has a very amusing storyline and wonderful central performances from Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon.The slightly odd thing about this film is that it is pitched as a comedy, but contains a sub-plot involving gangsters bootlegging and bumping people off in order to set up its story. In some ways it's quite dark and shouldn't really work, but in this instance it does. Even though these gangsters are meant to be ruthless mobsters, for me they never quite come across as being as cruel or as mean as they could have been; this is mostly down to the interactions and banter that is exchanged between them and the other characters. Raft is superb as Spats Columbo and Harry Wilson as his dim-witted henchman is also responsible for plenty of laughs.Monroe was famously difficult to work with on this film and her scene where she is talking to Junior on the phone where her eyes are darting around all over the place clearly show that she was reading her lines from some kind of teleprompter or autocue. Although this was a trying project for Wilder, I personally feel it was worth all the pain and anguish as the overall product here is so good and has left the world with a very satisfying and funny film.The chase sequences at the end are top drawer and the film has one of the funniest and most memorable final lines in cinema history. In short, Some Like It Hot is the best of the best and even though it is now more than 60 years old it is still superb and is well worth seeing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

I'm used to seeing him in a more swav cool style role, but he cracked me up! Also this was the first film I having seen Jack Lemmon in as well, really looking forward to seeing more of his roles.

The gold standard for a romantic comedy,"Had an ear to ear smile the entire time this one was on. Some Like It Hot seems a millennium ahead of its time; Wilder manages to hint at both mistreatment of women in society and the overemphasis of differences between the sexes through a wonderful veil of comedy. The film, for me, is a statement that where men and women are undeniably different, at the end of the day we're all just people- what a beautiful sentiment.Thematic analysis aside, Some Like It Hot is one of the most entertaining and gleeful movies I've ever seen. Marilyn Monroe gives a dazzling performance. This was my first time seeing her on screen and I was in awe of her- what a woman. Most of the humor comes from the plot itself, which allows Curtis and Lemmon to have a field day as their female counterparts. 'Daphne' being overjoyed about a wealthy male suitor is hysterical. One of my favorite viewing experiences to date. A landmark film and the standard by which all romantic comedies should be judged. I consider Some Like It Hot to be a masterpiece and an utterly timeless film.10/10: Sublime. Genre transcendent. Cannot say enough.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Some Like It Hot,"Sometimes, universally-beloved and celebrated classics live up to their acclaim; unattainable expectations can be met. Such is the case with Some Like It Hot, which I became hopelessly enamoured by. Despite mixed experiences with screwballs in the past, this is working on so many levels that it was impossible not to appreciate all of it: a slapstick within a gangster flick, a rom-com without sentimentality, a sex-comedy without any sex. With this, Notorious, and countless other Old Hollywood staples, I have realised that romance is better portrayed on-screen with subtlety - Wilder pushes censors to their limits, utilising innuendo, phallic imagery, and a half-dressed Marilyn Monroe to create a film where every character is thinking about sex constantly, yet it is never crude or explicit, only cheeky and winking. ""Cross-dressing"" comedies always run the risk of lingering on one joke, and a dated one at that, as inevitable scenarios occur where characters have to hurriedly change outfits, or resist advances by someone of the same gender (can't have that!). The film features these tropes, to be sure, and I began worried that the humour would wear thin, but the rapid delivery and natural progression made it all feel fresh. There are visual gags aplenty around the lead males wearing drag, yes, however for the most part, the comedy is drawn from the broader absurdity of the whole scenario; it never looks down upon the idea, only the characters themselves for somehow reaching the point where this seemed the best course of action. (Or, at least, *I* think so. The concept of two men getting married is treated as obviously ridiculous, but in 1929/'59, it was. Also, Jerry's genuine excitement at the prospect of being engaged was a subversion I was not expecting for a studio movie from the '50s. I'm not nearly qualified enough to take this analysis any further, though, and I'm sure those who are have made far better, in-depth reappraisals of this aspect. Go read those. I know nothing.)The apparent freshness is at least partly due to a wonderful cast. Jack Lemmon is endlessly expressive, charming to a fault; Monroe and Tony Curtis are flawless too, exchanging dialogue as if they were coming up with it on-the-spot. Wilder's script is consistently witty, every punchline a cue for another. The hokey elements are delivered with such grace that they feel natural, helped by the heightened tone. Setups are executed wonderfully: see, for example, the use of Osgood, seemingly introduced for a throwaway bit where both ""women"" are advanced upon at the same time. (Acknowledgement of sexual harassment? In 1959? Gasp!) And, indeed, the porter who approaches ""Josephine"" serves exactly that role, occasionally reappearing as part of a running gag. But, Osgood is not one to give up, and his casual mention of owning a yacht had me grinning ear-to-ear at how precisely Wilder had put his pieces into place. (Joe E. Brown, incidentally, is also stellar in his role, and not nearly mentioned enough for being a vital side-character.) This is also shot far better than it had any right to be - see the wide of the pair escaping their flat, hidden by shadows, then later failing to conceal themselves coming down the window at the back of the gangster's room. A stark set of transitions between the two couples, one on a yacht, the other tangoing, generates laughs through blatant contrast. Generally I jot down brief notes while watching to remember what I want to mention, but not here: the greatness of Some Like It Hot is so apparent in its every scene that it was hard to reduce to specifics. From the first shot I was hooked, and spent the entire runtime just enjoying the experience. I feel confident in saying that everything after they arrive in Florida (so, the last hour-and-fifteen-minutes) is absolutely perfect; wouldn't change a thing. One of the best final lines in any film, ever.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

This is a kind of movie that can be watched with a family or friends and can be laughed at. It's a great movie to watch with just that we have to keep our brains out.Billy Wilder had earlier debuted with a movie called MINOR OR MAJOR where a woman becomes a minor to get a ticket at half price, so these kind of funny things are not new in Billy Wilder movies, just that they get funnier here. We have the ever young Marilyn Monroe here and wow, the way she walks is worth a watch and only few can kiss like Marilyn does on screen. There is certain kind of enigma to her personality I think that kept her the highest paid actress then.The technical aspects of this film are good, just that we don't care too much of it because of the constant laughs we get. Yes look at the scenes between Josephine and Daphne (the men turned women) and they are the best. There is a certain kind of comic timing that is just so hilarious. There is lot of running around too, chases in vans, cops, mafia dons, women, music all come together in this film.Above all that, it's the dialogue that makes it more lively, the last scenes where Daphne says ""I am a Man"" to which his male supposed fiancé says ""Well, nobody's perfect"" and there is THE END of this film.I am going with 4/5 for a great fun movie.

"Billy Wilder's immortal masterpiece farce, with Jack Lemmon, Cary Grant(oops, actually Tony Curtis), MM, and Joe E. Brown, all with type O blood","Rather recently voted the best comedy ever by a prestigious film organization. I wonder if they included silent comedies? If not, it probably would have won anyway. All the top roles were perfectly filled, and in particular, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis were fabulous, playing girls for an all girl band, initially.I missed a couple of standout actors in my overly long title. There's Joan Shawlee, as sexy Sweet Sue, leader of the girl's band, also acting as sort of a sorority mother, trying to keep the girls in line, made more difficult by the presence of Lemmon and Curtis....... Then, there's George Raft, playing an Al Capone-like gangster boss, named Spats. With apologies to Marlon Brando, he was perhaps the perfect guy for this role, born in Hell's Kitchen, and an early friend of mob boss 'Bugsy' Siegal, who later tried to use him to make inroads into Hollywood. True to form, in the '30s, he was often cast as a gangster or prisoner, sometimes with Humphrey Bogart in the second lead. He turned down the lead in several films in the early '40s, which went to Bogart, making his name, and leaving Raft in the dust. Ironically, Raft's last film, shortly before he died, was ""The man with Bogart's Face""!This being 1959, people often wonder why it wasn't shot in color. Marilyn insisted it had to be in color because her studio contract said all her films had to be in color. But, Billy overruled her, because the makeup used by Lemmon and Curtis caused a greenish cast to their faces!Speaking of Marilyn, as she usually did in her later films, she made life hell for the director and her fellow actors by routinely being late or absent, unprepared, sometimes unable to remember the simplest lines, getting the words mixed up. Poor Billy had to put up with this, because she was reckoned to be the star attraction. I can't believe her name was billed first, ahead of Lemmon and Curtis! What she had to do was nothing compared to their superb acting under difficult circumstances! She was pregnant, which made her look plumper than usual, something the director tried to work around.Oh, yes, the bit about have Type O blood was sort of a running gag, relating to the danger Jack and Tony ran of being shot by Spat's goons, since they were accidental witnesses to the restaging of the infamous St. Valentine's Day Massacre, actually orchestrated by Al Capone.In case everyone didn't get it, when Tony was playing a millionaire yacht owner to impress Marilyn, anyone familiar with Cary Grant should have recognized that he was parodying Cary's residual British-like speech manner. When Cary saw the film, he is said to have remarked: ""I don't talk like that"".Six years later, Curtis and Lemmon were again cast together in ""The Great Race"": a spoof of a historical auto race around the world, from NYC to Paris. But, this time, they were competitors rather than buddies. It has comedic aspects, mostly engineered by Lemmon, but it doesn't compare to the present film. Nonetheless, you might want to check it out, if never seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

This One's Still Red Hot!,"Some Like It Hot is a wacky, clever, ludicrous comedy that starts off like a firecracker and keeps on throwing off lively sparks till the very end.The plot is a classic screwball. The setup: It's Chicago, 1929; the era of jazz, prohibition, bootlegging and gangland rub- outs. Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) are two hack jazz musicians who inadvertently witness a mob killing on St. Valentine's Day. In a desperate bid to flee the scene, the boys jump onto a train to Florida disguised as Josephine and Daphne (""I never liked the sound of 'Geraldine'""), the newest members of an all-girl jazz band where they fall for attractive, bubble-headed ukulele- player Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe). Once in Florida, Joe poses as the tycoon Junior, sleazily designed to fulfill Sugar's every fantasy of a man while Daphne, carried along on the tides of farcical necessity, is propositioned by an addle-brained millionaire Osgood (Joe E. Brown). Seductions and obvious complications ensue. Identities become fluid and changeable. Just when things start looking up, the goons arrive for a mobster's convention at the same hotel where the girls and the two erstwhile guys are playing. And soon a volley of bullets and witty lines fly by!Fifty-five years on, Billy Wilder's charade has lost none of its luster, largely because of the absolutely riotous turns by the three principal cast members. Monroe's performance as the fuzzy blonde Sugar has a deliciously naive quality. She's a comedienne with that combination of sex appeal and timing that is unrivaled even today. Both Curtis and Lemmon are absolutely impeccable as they bicker, cross-dress, and chase their way into audience's hearts. Their interactions are never less than the stuff of comic gold (watch Lemmon mouth ""If those gangsters come in here and kill us, and we're taken to the morgue dressed like this I'll die of embarrassment."") while they play off of one another in such a way that they simultaneously propel the plot's shenanigans and develop their characters.The movie's lasting impact, however, is owed in great deal to the direction and the Wilder touch is indelible: a work of shocking confidence. He treats the outlandish plot so deftly that the ridiculous somehow appears possible and the shocking turns into laughter. He keeps the momentum of this madcap comedy such that it keeps rolling along, a mirthful romp that knows just when to draw back before crossing the line to the vulgar.There's an illusion of effortlessness about Some Like It Hot that contributes to its endurance: though the characters are sweating through the madcap circus, Wilder and the top-notch cast keep the proceedings effervescent and breezily paced, giving us a movie with remarkable audacity that transcends all ages for the sake of a universal good time. A peerless classic!",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
This aged surprisingly well,"You'd think that a movie from 1959 about two guys dressing up as women would age very poorly but nope, it's actually pretty great and genuinely funny at times.I just love stories where men dress up as women (maybe not all of them, cuz let's be real they sometimes can have jokes in poor taste) and so have to deal with things women deal with everyday, something about that feels almost cathartic to me in a odd way.Also, if there was ever any doubt I was queer, well there isn't anymore because that scene where Marilyn Monroe sings while wearing a semi transparent dress... Well let's just say I was looking respectfully.But seriously, she's the highlight of the film, just like any film she was ever in, she's not just beautiful but she also happens to have a beautiful voice to match.One last thing, That final line may just be the best of any movie ever, just saying, it's both funny and unexpected and I love it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Almost Perfect,"Wilder directs this classic comedy about musicians trying to escape from the mob with great verve and elicits memorable performances. It features the definitive dumb blonde performance by Monroe as Sugar Kane. Curtis does a good impression of Cary Grant, with whom he worked in ""Operation Petticoat"" the same year. Lemmon has one of his best roles as a woman in love. Brown is delightful as the man who lusts after Lemmon and gets to utter the film's famous closing line. The only quibbles are that the characters are cartoony and the violence is somewhat jarring for a comedy. As great as this is, Wilder would follow it up with another great comedy, ""The Apartment.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
One of the best romantic comedies of all time,"For being such an old film, this was hilarious. It's especially filled with little nice touches, things than the moment when you see them, you can't help but laugh. A lot of the humor makes fun of the mob, a little of it is even black humor. When I sat down to watch it, I had no idea it was so unbelievably funny. The humor is pretty much constant, there is mostly something to laugh at every single minute of the entire movie. Something that's great about the humor is that it comes off as naturally funny, it doesn't try too hard to be funny. Tony Curtis was great, so was Jack Lemmon; even Marilyn Monroe was pretty good in this movie. This movie has some of the funniest moments ever seen on film, and should be viewed by pretty much everyone who's into romantic comedies. I've only seen it once so far, but I have a feeling that I'll watch it many more times. It's one of those films that never get old.

"""Some Like It Hot"" is a Black and White tragedy that could have been such a great success in Color.","A terrific comedy and entertaining movie; well written, well directed by the great Billy Wilder, and well acted by all, but for some inconceivably stupid reason made in Black & White, where in Color it would have been a huge winner.  Probably the best motion picture Tony Curtis ever made and a great Jack Lemon piece of work, not to mention an excellent performance by the incredibly sensuous Marylin Monroe, not to mention the rest of a great cast.But the Black & White kills half the jokes, and even more of the overall humor and really leaves Marylin looking rather plain.  Am I sexist?  When it comes to the beautiful job in the creation of the quintessential beauty of Marylin Monroe, yes, I enjoy the great aesthetic gift of nature to mankind that she was.  Not to mention that she wasn't a dumb blonde, but surprisingly insightful.  When she married Joe Dimaggio, a reporter asked her if she regretted her early tragic life.  Marylin Monroe answered, ""No, because it all brought me to this wonderful moment.""  That's real insight. Unfortunately, Dimaggio had no idea how to commit to loving someone who was deeply troubled by her past and evidently he couldn't stand the competition, so once again she got dumped and dumped on.""Some Like It Hot"" is a Black and White tragedy that could have been such a great success in Color.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

It is nearly impossible to overstate the quality of Some Like It Hot, which seems about as close to perfect as a feature film can get.

Trouble with Marilyn,"'It's the biggest slapstick comedy ever created,' Billy Wilder used to warn the reporters.Gangsters from the era of prohibition and ladies from a female orchestra. Milioneers and the unemployed of the Great Crisis. Escapes and chases. Love. Sex and dressing-ups. All this spins in a craftly-planned order.In the year 1984 an English magazine 'Time Out' judged 'Some Like It Hot' very harshly. 'Stereotypical sexism, hopelessly stupid jokes, lots of bad taste.' Five years later, the same magazine asked 60 film critics and directors to join a survey for 100 greatest film in the history of cinema and Wilder's movie ended up on the 4th place. As the greatest comedy of all times. In movie guidelines edited by that newspaper, the quoted opinion has never been repeated.The idea was given to the writers by a German film 'Fanfares of Love' with a female orchestra 'The Cyclamens' and dressing-ups. They however changed everything here. The plot begins in the year 1929 in Chicago. Joe and Jerry. Two unemployed musicians. They unwillingly become witnesses of the infamous St. Valentine's Day massacre and the begin running away in female costumes. They join a female orchestra which is on its way to Florida. Joe. Dressed as Josephine. He falls in love in a singer called Sugar. And Jenny as Daphne becomes an object of energetic courtship of an old millionaire.A parody of gangster movies from the 20's. It fluently bind with humor and burlesque of the crazy comedies from the 30's. The dressing-ups give occasions of playing uncountable spicy jokes. And they co-create the atmosphere of the film which is filled with eroticism. But Wilder succeeds in keeping balance.The film was such a big success thanks to marvelous acting of the the three main performers. Tony Curtis as Joe makes a parody of Cary Grant. Jack Lemmon with the role of Jerry/Daphne begun a wonderful co-operation with Wilder (7 movies, including 'The Apartment'). And Marilyn Monroe. Sensual. Full of charm. Always troubled with something. She made a discrete parody of a naive-blond-type. And she filled the gaps of her role with some songs.There was however a mass of trouble with her. Monroe was usually late or she didn't appear on the stage. She didn't remember her dialogs. She sometimes got the grip after more than 20 cuts. There is a scene. She goes into Joey's room in it. And she asks, 'Where is the bourbon?'. That scene was repeated 47 times. Nothing helped. Even cards with text that were put in the drawers she was opening. Noot even big signs behind the camera. Her partner, Tony Curtis, was significantly frustrated. He was tired of repeating because his freshness of play was gone. After the scene with the kiss, Curtis said, ""Kissing Monroe is like kissing Hitler"". The behavior of the actress was later explained by her shyness. Her problems. Suspecting her own disbelief in her talent. And psychological depression caused by the fact that she was pregnant at that time.The movie won Golden Globe Awards for the best comedy and the performances by Marylin Monroe and Jack Lemmon. However the Oscar went only to the costume designer - Orry-Kelly.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A Billy Wilder classic,"Billy Wilder made some of my favorite films in Double Indemnity, The Lost Weekend, Sunset Boulevard, Stalag 17, The Seven Year Itch and Some Like It Hot. A great presenter of romantic comedies and of drama as well. It was interesting reading how Frank Sinatra, Danny Kaye, Bob Hope, Jerry Lewis and Anthony Perkins and Mitzy Gaynor had been considered for this movie. Who knows what could have happened with Billy Wilder directing but what he got out of Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon was classic. I often wondered why this was filmed in black and white instead of color and the IMDb explained it as Wilder didn't like how Curtis' and Lemmon's makeup appeared on screen in color. I can't buy the explanation given that their makeup looked green on screen. That could have easily been corrected. I think color would have brought more attention to their overall appearance as men dressed as women and made them look less plausible and more like men in drag in the enhancement of color so for overall effect he shot it in black and white. It also fits the 1920's themed story. I've never seen this on the big screen but it was a staple on TV in the 60's and 70's and has been since. I've probably seen this at least a dozen times and have alway enjoyed it. It's been a few years since I've seen it last and I wouldn't mind seeing it again soon. A great cast in support with George Raft, Pat O'Brien, Joe E. Brown who is especially good and Nehemiah Persoff. Nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction and Best Actor for Jack Lemmon, it won it's only Oscar for Best Costume Design. It's a quick paced, fun film but for me falls a little short and I would give it a 9.0 on a scale of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Marilyn also plays Sugar, a girl down her luck and in a girl's band because she'll do anything to stay away from men and she does a great job in this role.

Monroe's Finest Performance,"Named by the AFI as the best comedy of all time this film holds a very special place in my heart. Mostly for being Marilyn Monroe's greatest movie. The woman had a presence that was larger than life, but was in a lot of clunkers, as the studio system didn't really now what to do with her except use her as eye candy. Her character in Seven Year Inch doesn't even have a name! Her Sugar Kane (aka Sugar Kowalczyk), while ""not very bright"" by her own admission, has an optimism and a sadness that was what made Monroe the icon she is today. Jack Lemon also shines as Jerry/Sugar. Once Jerry becomes Daphne (he was going to be Geraldine, but never liked that name), it's like he truly comes alive. Jerry is a worrier, but Daphne is always cracking jokes, ending almost every line of dialogue with a giggle. http://amandalovesmovies.com/2012/02/19/some-like-it-hot/",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A Comedy Ahead of Its Curve,"Billy Wilder's 1959 masterpiece, ""Some Like it Hot"", isn't just a hilarious film - it's a cultural touchstone that defied convention and remains uproariously funny to this day. Set against the backdrop of the roaring twenties, the film follows two down-on-their-luck musicians, Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon), who witness a gangland massacre and are forced to flee Chicago disguised as women.Their escape route? Joining an all-female jazz band led by the effervescent Sugar Kane Kowalczyk (Marilyn Monroe). What follows is a whirlwind of mistaken identities, romantic hijinks, and witty dialogue that never misses a beat.""Some Like it Hot"" dared to push boundaries in its era. Cross-dressing, a touchy subject at the time, is handled with surprising deftness and humor. Lemmon's bumbling Daphne and Curtis's suave yet insecure Josephine are comedic gold, playing on both the absurdity of the situation and the societal expectations of femininity.The film also cleverly navigates themes of sexuality and gender fluidity, all while maintaining a light and playful tone. The homoerotic subtext between Jerry and the band's bass player, for instance, is a subtle yet undeniably present layer that adds another dimension to the humor.Monroe is a revelation as Sugar, a ditzy blonde with a surprising singing voice and an even more surprising depth. Curtis delivers a nuanced performance, showcasing both his comedic timing and his charm. But it's Lemmon who truly steals the show. His portrayal of Daphne is a masterclass in slapstick and physical comedy, creating a character that is both endearing and hilarious.""Some Like it Hot"" transcends its time period. The sharp script, impeccable performances, and Wilder's masterful direction ensure that the film remains as fresh and funny today as it was in 1959. It's a testament to the power of great comedic storytelling that transcends cultural norms and leaves audiences in stitches.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Marilyn Monroe's Greatest Perfromance,"In Show Business, business always wins out over ""show"" in Hollywood. Too much has been written about Marilyn Monroe's physical appearance and not enough has been written about her artistic talent. There is plenty of ignorant chatter about Monroe being ""dumb"" or having the inability to memorize lines. People who make those comments are idiots. Tony Curtis, for example. At every public appearance and opportunity, when asked a question about Monroe, Tony Curtis would call her ""stupid"" or ""dumb."" Lore has it that Monroe declined his off-screen sexual advances, which was smart on her part, so it seems Curtis took to degrading her in public at every opportunity to placate his frustration.Marilyn Monroe suffered from dyslexia in an era that stigmatized the disability. It is no wonder she had difficulty memorizing lines. Male producers and male studio executives made an enormous amount of money by using her physical appearance to sell tickets. They didn't have any interest in cultivating her acting talent nor were they ever going to sacrifice profit in order to cast Monroe in any role other than the bombshell.Monroe's great acting talent is evident in Some Like It Hot and her performance is outstanding. Although the story follows two ""bosom buddies"" running from the mob, she enhances the quality of the film immensely. (The same can be said about the performance of Joe E. Brown.) Monroe is a scene-stealer in the sequences on the train and on the beach with her physical movement and brilliant repartee. It is unfortunate no one in Hollywood took note of her brilliant acting in the film to create better roles for her. If they had, this may not have been her greatest performance ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Rapid-Fire Comedy Classic,"In drag or drab, Lemmon & Curtis are marvelous together.

The gags are riotous, the dialogue rich with jokes and film in-jokes, some subtle, some not-so-subtle. Joe E. Brown, mugging unabashedly, steals every scene he is.  His tango with Lemmon is priceless.  Georgie Raft does such an accurate deadpan spoof of himself that you're not quite sure whether he gets the jokes.  He did. Nehemiah Persoff excels as Li'l Bonaparte.  Another thing here is that the singing, enjoyable and untaxing, never gets in the way of the plot, and the pacing is frenetic throughout.  the guys-in-drag bit had not been done before in a manner of such heartfelt empathy as Jack Lemmon gives it --Treat yourself to this one; it deserves its reputation as one of the top comedy classics of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

"One Of The Most Delightfully Entertaining Films Ever Made; ""Some Like It Hot"" Remains The Definitive Screwball Comedy","Throughout cinema history there have been many historic comedians, all varying in style and range. From the likes of Chaplin and Keaton to the Pythons and the Coens and to directors like Billy Wilder. Wilder is a man who never failed to create the perfect slice of entertainment, as he once said ""movies should be like amusement parks"". Although, Some Like It Hot is a flawed film and not on the same level as Wilder's true cinematic masterpieces it still remains a highly accomplished work of entertainment. And there are no wonders as to why it was ranked no.1 on AFI's ""Funniest Movies of All-Time""; it truly is a spectacle in the art of comedy.Some Like it Hot contains one of the most simple, yet wonderfully unique premises of all-time. Set during the prohibition Some Like It Hot follows the mishaps of two male musicians who are looking for a job, while being caught up with the mob. Unable to find work they opt in to play for a female band and so have to cross-dress to gain ""discreet"" access to the band. Surprisingly both fit in with the group and quickly befriend Sugar (Marilyn Monroe), a friendship that soon develops into them both falling for her...The idea of Some Like It Hot is incredibly outlandish and extraordinarily outrageous. The film's complex was a long way ahead of its time and one that was risqué and daring on release due to the supposed ""homosexuality"" portrayed in the film. Today, the film remains one of the triumphant examples of comedy, ultimately being a satire on '20s America portrayed through slyly hysterical humour. The film shows off the talents of Wilder and the array of talent he has cast on the film. The rampant script propels the film at extraordinarily fast pace and uses subtle metaphysical language to portray half-disguised sexual-innuendo. The sexual-innuendo remains one of the film's highlights due to the way it is incorporated into the script through fast wit, raunchiness and ""flashy"" language. To simply imply the script is ""good"" is an understatement; the script's craftsmanship is beyond the realm of genius and is so goofy, screwy and intelligent that it is impossible to deny the brilliance.Some Like It Hot is a film I can watch anytime, due to the amount of material and level of enjoyment on offer, it is a film bursting with charisma and charm. Actors Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are two of the finest American actors to ever grace cinema, their partnership created through the fantastic chemistry is inseparable. It is an example of pure character acting at the top of its game. Jack Lemmon (as with most of the films he starred in) steals the show with his wildly energetic, charismatic and ""fitting the role"" performance. Jack Lemmon's persona is so uplifting, consistently succeeding in being the actor's actor. Then you have the hysterical Tony Curtis who brings bold hilarity and fierce energy to the screen, an actor who always feels suitably cast. Marilyn Monroe on the other hand is an actress I have always felt to be untalented at ""acting"", yet skilled at working with spontaneous comedy and probably due to her own infamous personality. Although not a good actress, she is still cast with accuracy and slides into her role as Sugar with ease because of her own similarities to the character. She also adds another element of iconic value to the film.Although there is nothing much below the surface of Some Like It Hot that does not stop it from being an intellectual illustration of class A comedy. For a film so eccentric it is honestly amazing at how remarkably efficient the film is at succeeding in offering mass-appeal. Some Like It Hot is full of dry sexual tendencies, symbolic sexual imagery (yes, not only hidden in the script, but subtly shown throughout the film) and the indisputable class the film carries. The use of simple set-pieces helps rotate the comedy, offering impulsive comedic actions and a countless array of jokes.The film's notorious line ""well, nobody's perfect"" goes for the film too. Although not as perfect as Wilder's ""league of their own"" masterpieces (Sunset Blvd., The Apartment, Double Indemnity, Stalag 17) that still does not stop it from being a gem of cinematic joy. Wilder is one of the few directors who truly deserves his legendary directional and screen writing acclaim, it is beyond fact that Wilder had a genuine aptitude for cinema. Some Like It Hot is an example of Wilder's fantastic versatility and his trademark of dealing with warped identities.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Nobody's Perfect,"The 1959, Romantic Comedy Classic, Some Like It Hot, starring Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis, and Jack Lemmon, tells a story in times of sociological pressures of perfection and conceptualism of the structure of society. 1959 marked the beginning of, what we would later call, LGBT communities. The approach to submitting a movie that promotes tolerance towards cross dressing and ultimately the idea of homosexuality, is done with impeccable timing. To set the movie in earlier era allows for the viewer to think that such a tolerance was being upheld in that specific time era. Perpetuating for the allowance in the era to date. Film stood to put the war behind. This film did so, with a concentrated focus of enlightenment derived and depicted through the life of struggling musicians. The movie depicted an era where individuals could be anything/anyone. They were able to swap their former lives for the life of luxury. Music was becoming even more popular across the country. The all women's band represented female independence as well as equality. This was an era of times for embarking on a journey of self-discovery and rebellion, which was depicted by the character Sugar. Sugar was a runaway with the hopes of a life change through marriage. Flirtatiousness and drinking were deviant in the eyes of society. However, depicted with finesse and naturality in this romantic comedy. My favorite line of the movie was in the last scene.

Monroe, Curtis and Lemmon there would be lost today, alas. So let's be happy we have them saved - in the movie of the period when actors were the stars yet!",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
George Raft--the center of the movie....,"I first saw this movie, I think, sometime in the 1970s--not certain. At the time, I don't think I appreciated just who George Raft was. George Raft played many a heavy during the '30s & '40s--he had the same heft as Edward G. Robinson or James Cagney. He was also something of a hoofer as well. (Thanks to YouTube, his performances can now be seen and reviewed.) Somebody must have neglected to tell George Raft that he was making a comedy; he plays the role of mobster hit-man (Spats Colombo) straight. Comedy means taking a point of absurdity and drawing it to its logical conclusion; and not recognizing an absurdist moment, playing that straight makes for a very droll form of comedy.Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon dressing up as women becomes the absurdist moment with built-in Comedy. The ""dumb"" / curvaceous blonde Marilyn Monroe is there for the comedic element. George Raft (as Spats Colombo --wearing iconic white-spats) is the straight man who murders rivals and in turn is murdered. That is inherently not funny, and George Raft recognizes that so he plays the role of mobster with a straight face, despite a few manic chase scenes.I just don't think George Raft gets the credit he deserves for the role he plays.A note about Marilyn Monroe. She had not quite attained iconic status in 1958; she would die prematurely of alcohol and pill popping in 1962 at age 36. Oftentimes, we hear of her late-attendance, her inability to deliver her lines, her difficulty in performance; though interviews with the cast re her long after her un-timely death, acknowledge the difficulties, the interviewees sort of gloss over them--let's not speak ill of the dead. But her performance here is stellar, thanks to the patience of Billy Wilder as Director, whatever her own limitations.The movie is a comedic success because it works on so many levels, not the least of which it is a ""feminist"" tract. That last line by Joe E. Brown after Jack Lemon confesses, he can't get married to Joe E. Brown because he is a man and not a woman--Joe E. Brown--says: ""Nobody's perfect"" speaks to exactly what the movie is about--a feminist tract about being female. Presumably, Joe. E. Brown acknowledges that women are ""perfect"" while it is the male that is ""imperfect."" Now that line is funny!",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Some like it a lot,"For the most part, I enjoyed this very unusual farce. Casting two men who made themselves up as women in order to escape the wrath of a murderous Chicago gang was a clever plot idea. The incorporation of the historic St. Valentine's Day gangland massacre into the screenplay provides some diversion from the business of trying to continue fooling people into believing that Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are women. Tony and Jack are the principal comedy team. We have 2 other actors: Marilyn Monroe and Joe E. Brown, who are principally strait men for the comedians. The members of 2 gang also serve, to a limited extent, as straight men.The casting was near perfect. Tony and Jack made a great comedy team, and were made up to look like women about as well as possible. The main problems were their manner of walking and their voices, which should have given them away as men. This is a major weakness of the screen play: perhaps fatal if that bothers you too much. Sadly, much of stage and film humor relies on victims who are unusually nonobservant, clumsy or stupid. This reduces the comedic value. Implausible happenings and connections between scenes are frequent in this film. Again, too many of such reduces the comedic value of the film. However, as in this film, this significant negative can often be compensated for by sufficient truly funny happenings. Also, children are no doubt generally less bothered by implausible happenings, judging by the popularity of animations.The scene where various members of the female band gradually squeeze into Jack's(as female)train berth because he has some bootleg liquor reminds me of the famous scene in The Marx Brothers' ""A Night at the Opera"", where more and more people have a reason to squeeze into their tiny hotel room, falling and climbing all over each other, until the last one opens the door and half spill out.In addition to masquerading as a woman, Tony masquerades as a rich sea captain, several times going back and forth between one disguise and the other, primarily for the purpose of seducing Marilyn. Clearly, he is trying to imitate Cary Grant's manner of speaking as the captain, reasonably successfully. This somewhat reminds me of a later film starring Tony: ""The Great Imposter"", where he successfully masquerades as a number of men in their work.It's clear from a comment by Joe E. Brown that the title means that some people prefer jazz.As usual, Marilyn plays an innocently slutty gold-digger. And, as with so many of her later films, sounds like she was a basket case much of the time, showing up very late or not at all, forgetting her lines, crying and complaining. The director had to put up with these distractions because the public still loved her.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A Laugh a Minute!,"Laughs, chuckles, and guffaws. It's silliness at its best! My favorite scene is the umpteen girls having a party in that tiny train berth drinking Manhattans.  Hilarious!!

SLIH trending downward???,"IMDb is having a great injustice, doubtless the misguided influence of political correctness. Keep in mind this was released in 1959. I saw this at the Lawrence Park theater in Broomall, probably age 10, before Valenti. Thanks goodness I looked much older, but I don't believe there were any restrictions anyway at that time. After seeing it shortly after its release, I have probably seen it 30 times or more since, both at the Cinema & on little screens. Clearly one of the greatest comedies of all time & unequivocally one of my top two (with the other being Tampopo.) Some Like It Hot was arguably MM's best role & she was almost up staged by her two drag partners in crime, Jack Lemmon & Tony Curtis, for whom this was arguably their best role as well. Billy Wilder was at the height of his powers & despite his famous difficulties with MM, he managed to squeeze her most endearing performance & provided flattering cinematography. I believe this was Wilder's finest comedy, which is saying something. Keep in mind this was 1959 & was conceived under a long Eisenhower administration. Wilder was way out on this one & I suspect JFK requested the dress MM wore when she crooned him for his birthday come from this flick. Don't write many comments, but trending down ain't right for this MASTERPIECE.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Marilyn Monroe, jazz, and the mob... you can't go wrong with that!","Some Like it Hot is a fantastic movie, for the older crowd.  With great actors and actresses, a great plot, the mob, and a little bit of jazz, they couldn't go wrong. Some Like it Hot stars the sex icon Marilyn Monroe as Sugar.  Sugar is a musician in an all-girls band that always falls for male saxophone players. Over the course of the movie, she goes from being strong to completely vulnerable, then to completely crazy at times.  They could not have picked a better actress to play this role.  It seems like it was purposely written for her.This movie also stars Jack Lemmon, as Daphne (otherwise known as Jerry), and Tony Curtis as Josephine (otherwise known as Joe).  These two actors did a fantastic job.  They play two male musicians that witness a mob hit.  They then decide they need to leave town.  They need to disguise themselves, though, so they dress up as girls, and join an all-girl band.After the band, including Daphne, Josephine, and Sugar, arrive in Florida, the plot heats up.  Josephine (Joe) ends up falling for Sugar, who thinks he's a girl, and Daphne gets hit on but a millionaire that thinks he's a girl.  Meanwhile, the mob is still looking for the Joe and Jerry to kill them.This movie will have the viewer on the edge of their seat wondering what will happen next.  It will also have them cracking up laughing.  This reviewer would give this movie a 10, but not recommend it for small children.  There are many adult themes that would not be appropriate.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

"Marilyn Munroe was born on June 1st, 1926","Director Billy Wilder brings to the screen a wonderful comedy, that was totally ahead of its time. It's a film that is ground-breaking, because of the underlying sexual identity tones found in the subplot. Those tones are struck by taking Tony Curtis (Josephine) and Jack Lemmon (Daphne), into a situation they can't avoid. In order for them to survive being killed by the mob, Joe (Curtis) and Jerry (Lemmon), have to dress as women musicians, in order to make their escape to Miami. Both actors' performances are dead-on perfect and both of them do extremally good jobs alternating between themselves and their female alter-egos.On the train trip to Miami, the boys (as the girls), meet the rest of the band, most notably, Sugar (Marilyn Munroe). The music tour begins for the band and so does an example of a great romantic comedy. Even though the film takes place in the 1920s, it has all of the feel of the coming 1960s. That is what Billy Wilder was good at. His ability to make his films seem ""ahead of their times"", beyond the time they were released. This one has that feel of the early seventies. In order to protect his secret, Joe assumes the identity of a rich, eccentric millionaire, in his attempts to garner affections from Sugar. He uses a phony accent, that sounds every bit, like a Cary Grant impersonation. Daphne jokes that no one talks like that.The film entertains, as well as, creates some interesting food for thought. Being as it was the eve of the 1960s, the tides were changing, ever so slightly towards sexual and gender freedoms for all. Remember, the 1960s was the age of free love. Sex was a powerful thing in the 1960s. Having two of Hollywood's biggest male stars, dress up as women, because they couldn't find work among their male peers, was a huge statement. This is why Billy Wilder always seemed ahead of the times. He felt 1959 was the springboard for this movement and that the subject matter in this film needed its chance to be told. Just to be clear, I'm not talking about two men dressing up as women. The real message is the idea of men marrying men.John Ford, who would direct James Stewart, three years later, in the film, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962), through Stewart, reminds the audience of the message, that some people forget the part in the Constitution, that all men are created equal. In this film, Wilder, through the performance of Curtis and Lemmon, reminds the audience sarcastically, the ludicrous notion, that men don't want to marry men. It is a part of the subplot, that is hit upon, multiple times in the film. It is an issue that isn't rectified, in real life, for another 50 years, but Wilder starts the movement now in this film.This is why I try to emphasize to people, to put their frame of mind into the time period that the movie was released. Looking back at this from a 21st century perspective is thought-provoking by seeing the start of changing cultural and social tides. It is good understanding how we were like back then, because that lesson helps us make ourselves better today. This is what is great about old Hollywood movies. Being able to see the evolution of humankind in the 20th century to this point today, is a great tool to have at our disposal, because if we didn't have the movies to remind us of where we were, we wouldn't have the lessons needed to learn from our mistakes.8.8 (B+ MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Wilder & A Fine Cast Make a Goofy Story Very Enjoyable,"Billy Wilder's great story-telling skills and a fine group of performers take a pretty goofy story and make ""Some Like It Hot"" a very enjoyable movie, whose carefree disregard for realism belies a skillful and creative production. With a tale so full of implausible developments and characters, it's almost as if Wilder wanted to see just how far he could stretch it and still come up with a top-quality picture. It's hard not to compare it with Hitchcock's ""North By Northwest"", released the same year, in which Hitchcock and another excellent cast tell an equally unlikely story with exceptional craftsmanship.With their energetic yet contrasting personas, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis make an ideal leading pair for a movie of this nature, . Their energy and their sense of just how far they can exaggerate things make it very easy to like their characters and to become interested in what happens to them, and in turn that makes everything else fit together.While much of what Marilyn Monroe does cannot properly be called acting, she does work particularly well here. She was very well-matched with her character, and comes across quite naturally. The supporting cast all have much smaller roles, but they are also crucial to making the movie so entertaining. George Raft, Nehemiah Persoff and Joe E. Brown all get some particularly good moments.Wilder himself pulls out all the stops to add a lot of creativity to the settings and to move things along at an ideal pace, bringing the characters to one new predicament after another. The most implausible developments become amusing when handled with such craftsmanship. While some of Wilder's other pictures were more impressive as artistic achievements, for entertainment value this is as good as any of them.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Pretty Perfect,"The St. Valentine's Day Massacre! No one would dare make a comedy set against the backdrop of this brutal gangland event of the 1920s, right? Well, if that were true we wouldn't have one of the funniest movies ever made. Who else but Billy Wilder could take a serious subject like that and turn it into the hysterical comedy romp that is Some Like It Hot?I was never a big fan of Marilyn Monroe as a leading lady, but this movie is my exception. She's actually quite good, but surprisingly, she's shown up by the other two leading ""ladies."" For some reason, men dressing in drag has always been extremely funny to American audiences. As an American, I can't disagree.Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis know exactly how to deliver that great Wilder & Diamond dialogue. But I can't understand how only Lemmon got the Oscar recognition. I can't really choose which actor did a better job with their role and I suppose that's where Monroe comes in.I don't want to leave out the amazing supporting cast that Some Like It Hot has to offer. You have the always intimidating George Raft as the villain, the always dependable Pat O'Brien as the detective, and the always hilarious Joe E. Brown as Jack Lemmon's love interest. You'll have to see the movie to believe that last part.With all my rambling on about how funny this movie is, you're probably wondering what it has to do with the St. Valentine's Day Massacre and why the male leads are in women's clothing. Well, Lemmon and Curtis witness the killing and have to escape the clutches the men who carry it out. Along the way, they run into Marilyn Monroe and some of the funniest lines in film.If you're in the moody for zany hijinks that only to notch comedy talent can provide, then search no further.

**** and More for Classic Comedy Film,"Billy Wilder was really at the top of his game with this screwball comedy hit of 1959.When loser-musicians Joe and Jerry (Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon) witness the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre in Chicago, they look to leave town at once. While in freezing Chicago, they seek out an opportunity to join an all girls' band that's headed towards Florida.Our 2 heroes soon adopt the names of Josephine and Daphne and that's when the hilarity really begins.The film has a top-notch cast including Marilyn Monroe in the part that was made for her-Sugar Kowalski- a love stricken loser who loves to hit the booze to drown out her problems. Joyce Jameson, a frequent artist under Wilder, is in rare form as Sweet Sue, the head of the band. Joey E. Brown as the millionaire who falls for Daphne is just divine and George Raft, as Spats, the guy who is the head of the gang and after Josephine and Daphne, is in perfect form. Pat O'Brien is simply memorable as the chief of police.After a wonderful existence in hiding out in Florida, the 2 come face to face with the gang when the latter shows up there for a salute to the Friends of the Italian Opera.The writing is near perfect along with the performances. Curtis' imitation of Cary Grant is memorable.""Some Like It Hot"" should have been nominated for best picture in 1959.

AWESOME,"Some like it HOT!!! What else is there to say?When presented with the opportunity to watch this film, honestly, I was very excited. This movie stars Marilyn Monroe, whom I absolutely adore! This has by far become one of my favorite movies of all time!The plot of this movie was about two men who are trying to flee from a `mafia' that is after them. They want to escape the state, but are not really having any success. Well, one of the two men has a brilliant idea to audition for an all girls band (the two men are talented musicians). Seeing as how they are men, and would never even be considered for this band, the only way for them to audition is to dress up, and play the role of a woman. Any situation that involves men trying to portray woman is just hysterical, but watching men who are trying to be women, yet thinking the other woman are totally sexy, is even funnier!!! 	The two men, or dare I saywoman, are accepted into the choir, and are recognized for their musical abilities. Well just as expected, the two men just drool over the beautiful Marilyn Monroe, who plays a gorgeous singer names Sugar. Sugar thinks that these two ladies are just so lovely and kind. However, one of the men seems to like her more than the other, or at least just expresses it more. One of the scenes that was just so funny was where all of the ladies are on the train on their way to Florida. In the middle of the night Sugar sneaks over to one of the men's beds and asks to lie down with him (or her). The man becomes very very excited (and when I say excited I think you know what I mean) yet still trying to disguise himself as a woman. He tells Sugar that he will get some brandy (which sugar is very fond of alcohol) and they will have a little party. He goes on to tell her that maybe the night will bring a few surprises. Eventually all of the woman hear that there is a party in `number 7' and they all pile onto the bed with Sugar and them man, and start drinking. The woman all start tickling him, he gets scared that they will see up his nightgown and realize that he's not really a woman, so he decides to pull the emergency brake on the train, causing all of the other girls to fall onto the floor on top of each other.

A must-see comic classic,"Some Like it Hot is one of the funnier movies I've seen in a bit, and even though it's been ripped off, parodied and homaged in countless films since, it was still a joy to watch. It's surprisingly violent, and definitely threw me off guard with what to expect. It gave me a good laugh at the looking back at the mob years in 1959, and comparing it to the likes of what we have now.It was great seeing Jack Lemmon grace the screen again, and he rocks the casbah with Tony Curtis. But clearly, Curtis is no Walter Matthau. Monroe though, other than being eye-candy...is totally useless. Seriously, like I know I've never watched a movie of hers before, but she was so totally useless, and didn't deserve being the best credited star. Definitely a weak point of the film.But the direction, the acting, and the slapstick style of the movie is excellent, and is far better than what we have now.

My favorite film,"This film is about two male musicians who disguise themselves as women to flee the state. In the film, first, two men see the incident and are chased by the Mafia. Second, they disguise themselves as women to belong to an all women band and flee the state. Finally, they love the same woman, a member of the band who plays the ukulele, but they are found by the Mafia. I like the cast of the main characters in this film because they all act very well. Especially, I like the actors of two male musicians. I think it is difficult that actors act as women, but the actors of two male musicians act well and make the film very funny. Then, I also like the actress of the heroine, Marilyn Monroe. In this film, she has some scenes where she sings. Therefore, we can listen to her song and voice. In my opinion, though she doesn't sing well, her unique voice attracts us. When I watched the scene, I listened attentively to her song. This film has a lot of point worthy of note.

However,all the CREDIT for Some Like It Hot seems to go to Billy Wilder,whose remake/adaptation is quite remarkable.What is my point?: I'd better study the History of Films and learn how to write user comments , e.g.when to submit them to IMDb and how to express that Marylin Monroe's wiggling walk is quote ,from the film,"" Like Jell-0 on Springs""unquote.It is no wonder that I am indeed captivated by her, like many others, such as the Kennedys;may they and she Rest In Peace.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

brilliantly orchestrated chaos,"The most astonishing thing about this movie is that it works at all. I love Billy Wilder but The Seven Year Itch drove me right up the fricking wall with its testocentric mugging, and why should this movie have been any different when it pulls the same trick? Well first off, the context has opened waaay up: it appropriates the St. Valentine's Day Massacre as its inciting incident, it sweeps from Chicago winter to Florida sunshine. And this time, the filmmakers figure out how to construct an interesting critique of masculinity through the medium of Marilyn. Give us TWO male protagonists, joined at the hip; give us some gangsters to put their hormonal aspirations into some critical context; and by the time you've thrown in Joe E. Brown's lovable goofball playboy, the layering is so intense that it almost begins to resemble depth, and the construction so disorienting that it constantly feeds the comic requirement of surprise. That Tony Curtis's impersonation of a British millionaire sounds more like John Clarke only adds to the fun. And while Marilyn is still Marilyn, she's also looking a little rough around the edges here and there - her on-set nervous breakdown seems to have been incorporated rather than papered over. Brilliantly orchestrated chaos, suggesting that Wilder is only really Wilder when he's also A. I. L. Diamond.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Classy Classic,"Only at the threat of facing the firing squad do Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis don women's wardrobes in hopes of escaping murdering mobsters. So begins the picture, which in 1999, topped the American Film Institute's best comedy of all time list, Some Like It Hot (their inclination for laughter seems curious as Tootsie was listed second). The duo dressed-in-drag join an all-female band headed to Florida to entertain the wealth. In transit they meet the bodacious Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe), a real woman, with whom they befriend, secreting alcohol and sharing tales of past loves gone wrong. Chaos soon ensues as the cross-dressing escapees try to stay below the radar of the suspicious band-leader, are courted by women-hungry millionaires, and fall head-over-heels in love with Sugar Kane.Jack and Tony keep the outrageous action moving non-stop. Marilyn hypnotizes all in sight. Despite these, much of the film's comedic value impinged on the societal tension of the era. In 1959, this film challenged the mores of erotic decency, however, nearly half a century later, little is left of its lusty Eros now awash in contemporary hyper-sexual society. What remains is a classy comedy interwoven with magic, myth, and mystery. As the film's original audience enters their golden years Some Like It Hot will be remembered for its glorious and care-free style.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
It ain't a drag,"Some Like it Hot is one of my all time favorite movies.  Jack Lemmon gives a superb performance as Daphne.  Tony Curtis is also wonderful in this movie as Daphne's best ""girlfriend.""  This movie is ahead of its times because cross dressing wasn't exactly a normal thing back then, but this controversial subject is made very funny.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
a perfect example of a light-dark comedy standing the test of time,"Billy Wilder's Some Like it Hot is about what makes men different than women. It's funny, uproarious, because men who are big womanizers (they're musicians in 1929 prohibition-era Chicago after all) have to go in disguise as women so they aren't recognized as the men they are by mobsters who want to rub them out for several hits they witnessed. I loved seeing how the actors worked off of one another, especially because they had such wonderful dialog to work with. That is one part of it, and how steady the story actually is (it really never falters from being a classically told story for all of its wackiness that ensues), but it's just the repore of the stars, the power they exude on screen (that is, that Marilyn Monroe exudes) and how funny they are in playing it both serious and fun in a single beat.Now that that premise is out of the way, what else is funny about it? Where to start? For one thing just how Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis have their reactions to how they look or who they are as 'women' (""I'm more of a Daphnme"", Lemmon's Jerry says), and how they both react in varied ways to Marilyn Monroe's Sugar. Her character admits that she's stupid, but is she really? She's playing this ""girl' in other movies before, and yet it's a little varied this time around; she'd love to find a rich man on a yacht, sure, but she'd also just like to find a man who would treat her right. It's here that the fun, and some hidden depth and incredible sexual innuendo, comes out of the relationship between 'Cary Grant' Joe (a great-bad imitation) and Sugar, especially the scene between the two on the Yacht and their meeting on the beach... which is almost all of their scenes. They're quite brilliant.Jack Lemmon also scores very highly here with his performance as Jerry/Daphne. Any moment he has to react to Osgood is so funny because of how he reacts and how Joe E. Brown so consistently reacts to Daphne's expressions. It's surely one of the classic moments in movies at the end, but I perhaps loved even more just seeing how the two actors were in the tango scene (and Lemmon's reaction to that to Tony Curtis, the ""We're engaged!"" bit is one of the funniest scenes of its time, or any time). We get to see by Wilder's script and direction how men and women (or men as women or men as men) portray each other or react when trying to court. It's a sex farce that was somehow acceptable (I'm surprised some of the innuendo and dress got by with the censors at the time), but also has stayed fresh, maybe fresher, because of how precise it is in its observations on sex and relationships. It sort of goes between the very dark comedy of love in Sunset Blvd. with the lighthearted Hollywood stuff of Sabrina.The former may still be Wilder's best film, but Some Like it Hot finds him working at the peak of his powers with comic timing and sharp dialog for able and ready performers. Was Monroe ever funnier? Perhaps sexier in Seven Year Itch, or a technically better or deeper actress in Don't Bother to Knock. But she's on par with her male co-leads in delivering the goods as someone who gets how to do this comedy. It's rare for lightning to strike like this in comedy in general- The Producers, Duck Soup and His Girl Friday had it- and this is another example.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
It is a little bit funny-as in odd-that this is a cultural touchstone,"As a mere piece of entertainment and an escapist lark this is a delightful, very funny film. The two hours just flyby because everyone involved is at the top of their game. Whether it is the sardonic wit of Wilder, the sex appeal of Monroe, or the banter between Lemon and Curtis this is a farce that is utterly enjoyable. But I find it very odd that the premise of the film has morphed into a moral panic-a moral panic that has resulted in actual laws being written.Let me explain: Joe and Jerry put on women's clothes in order to escape the mob. But both-especially Joe-then use their perceived status as women to try to seduce women, i.e. Sugar. Joe even literally begins his seduction in a women's bathroom. The film isn't about trans folks, or even crossdressing but its premise is a myth reactionaries love to cite to ""justify"" de jure discriminatory treatment. I find it striking that such a farcical idea as transmuted in the culture to lurid idea.Add in Jerry's sweet-for a lack a better word-romance including that Osgood is nonplussed reaction to the big reveal and the film is wildly ahead of its time. I don't know to what-if any-extent that Wilder intended this film to be queer and/or have LGBT (sub)text. But it does even if the text is bothersome through that lens.The film is mainly a comedy-a great comedy. But because of its position in film history and the era it was released in it is a striking ur-text for cultural junk around transgressing gender norms.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Some Like It Hot,"It is quite an eye-opener for me to acquire that such a contentious sex-metamorphosis paranoia film could be made more than 50 years ago for the mainstream audience by the renowned Hollywood tycoon Billy Wilder, also sad to say, half century has elapsed, the evolution of mankind seems to be stuck in a halted mode.Certainly the film must be a comedy, which Billy Wilder is the virtuoso, the story is designed with scrupulosity, the set of the two pairs exudes some wonderful chemistry, for instance, which is vividly showcased by the parallel scenes of furthering their relationships respectively in the middle of the film.All the gags work swiftly and suitably at their occasions, the villain side was weakened to the lowest amount lest it would intrigue the audience a way too violent imagination, the ""spat"" stunt alone is capable of making the aftershock of the blood splattering all on the screen wane.The truly hero of the cast is Jack Lemmon without any doubt as Tony Curtis' role falls flat and Marilyn Monroe was definitely not at her best moment (even arguably her worst), Jack single- handedly distinguishes himself with his quirky accent and exquisite lady-gestures, I could never imagine he was able to act as a woman with such an extended plausibility!I haven't watched too many Marilyn Monroe's films, still, her pitiable role as a typical halfwitted blonde in the film interconnects her real life status, which could only leave me some earnest sorrow and compassion to her, and then it spontaneously coordinates flawlessly with the pitch of her role in the film, eventually it renders me an even stronger appreciation toward the film itself, which I bet Billy Wilder would never expected!One little complaint is the ending seems too hasty although leaving us the popular wisecrack WELL, NOBODY IS PERFECT. I wonder how come there has been no sequel or remake of this masterpiece, which will serve as a timely final straw to this era, where the comedy sector has never been so barren and vapid as now.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

"Funny, but...","Don't get me wrong; this is a very funny film. The situations these characters find and put themselves in are simply ridiculous and outrageous, making ""Some Like it Hot,"" a very enjoyable movie. Jack Lemmon is perfectly cast as usual, and delivers one great line after another as in just about every film he's in. Marilyn Monroe is brilliant here and proves to be a much greater actress than I would have thought. Tony Curtis also does very well in his role, and is very funny in claiming to be the owner of the Shell gas stations. My only problem with this film is the general job of acting done in this film. Somehow a lot of the movie just didn't come off as very realistic to me. In another film involving men disguising themselves as women (""Tootsie""), everything that happens seems believable and real. Here the acting by most of the supporting cast does not seem real to me. I personally find a film funnier if I can imagine all of the events really happening. Nevertheless, I guess it's just a comedy and shouldn't be critiqued too hard. There are plenty of laughs in this movie and I enjoyed it very much. I don't agree with the AFI's decision to name it the #1 comedy of all time, but it's not too far off.

"Some Like It ""What"" ?","Ever since I first viewed this film in 1983, I found this this film funny but not as riotous as others found it to be. Now, 25 years later, I still find this film overrated. For years, I've been trying to figure out why. Now I'm attempting to articulate my feelings for this comedy, for it's another ""classic"" film which needs its merits re-examined. This film has a terrific comic premise, but it didn't need to be dragged out for two hours. Any film with a farcical tone risks losing sustaining power with a long running time. One other film which died under its own weight was the three-hour-plus ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"", whose success ultimately rested on its cast, a mixture of serious actors(Spencer Tracy, for one), good(Sid Caesar, Jonathan Winters, etc.)and mediocre comic actors(Ethel Merman anybody?). Then again, director Stanley Kramer isn't famous for his comic gifts. Now for the cast of ""Some Like It Hot"". No blame will be heaped upon Tony Curtis & Jack Lemmon, whose performances in & out of drag justifies the positive reputation of this film; in fact, this film screeches to halt whenever either of them is off-screen. As for Marilyn Monroe, I enjoyed her singing; otherwise, I found her miscast in this film. The role of Sugar Kane needed someone with an unquestionably stronger sense of self than Monroe was capable of projecting here. Her frequently reported unprofessional behavior off-screen is all too evident here within this film; sadly, it would be the beginning of the end for her career and her life. Nevertheless, her name meant big box office for the film, and it is forever preserved on this film; however, there is no accounting for taste in what the public finds sexy, then or now. As for the rest of the cast, the only other actors who showed comic timing were Joan Shawlee as Sweet Sue and Joe E. Brown as Lemmon's romantic partner Osgood Fielding. Too bad the same couldn't be said for either George Raft or Pat O'Brien. I'm sure neither of them were hired for being funny, yet it's too bad director Billy Wilder didn't allow either of them to deliver his dialog with a little tongue-in-cheek. But Raft & O'Brien stop the film in its tracks, and that is symptomatic of a film farce lacking in any sense of pacing.

Timeless Classic - but what was wrong with Marilyn Monroe?,"Some like it hot is one of the best movies of the late 50's. It had the perfect cast, the perfect script and the perfect director. One of the most important things was that it had the perfect trio - Marilyn Monroe, one of the most famous sex symbols of the 20th century. Tony Curtis , a huge star and Jack Lemmon, a brilliant comedian. What could go wrong? One of the things I have noticed about the film is that Marilyn Monroe looks exhausted in most of her scenes and even in some just does not look attractive at all. I appreciate that she was pregnant to a baby she would a few weeks after shooting have a miscarrage to and that she was at the time suffering with her mental health. Also I always think of the story line as sort of a gansta film cros with a musical they just don't go. However, enough bad points on the film.

"After Monroe, there are no more elves","Monroe, as always, canary-style performances. Full of enthusiasm, sexiness, sweet voice, and grinning smile. However, the screenwriter of this movie is quite reluctant, the male protagonist who is dressed as a woman is not recognized, and then he is not recognized as a man. This ridiculous screenwriter has made the actors and directors no matter how hard they try. This film is inevitably attributed to mediocrity in the long film.However, I think most people will not pay attention to these details, just looking at the little elf Monroe is enough. This is one of the last films in her short life. The thought of the stunner's death in a few years will inevitably be sad.In fact, this film has a lot of highlights, for example, reflecting the Chicago gang fight, which is the prelude to the gangster film in full swing in the future. Almost all the characters in the future gangster movies are this image. And the public officials who always keep an eye on the gang are also an excellent addition to this movie. I mean, this movie, which is not a gangster film, raises the benchmark of gangster movies to a relatively high level.The years are really long, the three of those years: Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor, Monroe. One by one passed away. If Monroe did not die that year, we would eventually see an old woman like Taylor. And this contrast is simply unforgivable.

A very entertaining and clever comedy!,"""Some Like It Hot"", 1959***.5 (Very Good)A mini, capsule review. I viewed this film yesterday for the first time. I already knew the reputation of this film as one of Hollywood's best comedies. I was impressed and entertained by the clever and insightful screenplay, acting, film editing and directing. The story is set in 1929 Prohibition Chicago and then moves to Miami. This was one of the first films of it's kind for it's day back in 1959. Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are funny as two down on their luck musicians who witness a gangster murder, aka: The St. Valentines's Day Massacre. They go on the run from the gangsters and decide to go to Miami disguised as women while accompanying other traveling female musicians.Billy Wilder directed and co-wrote the adapted screenplay to this film. From this film and his previous past successes, Wilder has displayed a real talent for creative and insightful screenplays. In this film, he uses his social commentary style to positive effect in a cross dressing comedy. ""Some Like it Hot"" also makes fun of gangster films. Production values are high: cinematography, art direction and makeup. Wilder actually chose to photograph this film in black and white because of the garish makeup designs of it's two acting leads: Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon. ""Some Like It Hot"" succeeds on several levels: funny and insightful social commentary and acting. The editing and directing show a natural pacing and rhythm that works very well for a comedy film.

Who Wouldn't Like it Hot?,"""Some Like It Hot"" is an outstanding comedy from 1959, directed by the genius that was Billy Wilder and starring three true Hollywood greats. Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis supply all the laughs with their flawless comedic performances. The film is based around two musicians (Curtis and Lemmon) who find themselves witnesses to a gangland shooting. They search desperately for a musical job that will send them else where so they can escape the mob who are quickly tracking them down to ''silence'' them. The only available job is that of a girl group. Desperate times call for desperate measures and the unlikely pair take on fake names and through make-up and dress become women impersonators to join the girl group undetected.Of course, their quest is not an easy one and it leads to truly hilarious results. I'm not going to reel of endless details of the film's funniest moments but needless to say there are a whole wealth of them. Marilyn Monroe is outstanding in the film, and it proves once and for all what an under-appreciated true great of comedy acting she was. Curtis and Lemmon are a flawless double act and both put in career defining performances here. Monroe was reportedly at her most difficult during the film's production, but whatever was needed to create this truly wonderful box office gem was well worth it.

But Billy Wilder Did Come Close.,"Listed by American Film Institute as the greatest American comedy film of all time, Some Like It Hot may not live up to its exceptional reputation if one approaches it with such towering expectations but it certainly affirms its status as one of the best comedy films out there that promises loads of laughter & effortlessly delivers it.Set in 1929 in Chicago, Some Like It Hot tells the story of two struggling musicians who, after witnessing the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, flee the state in an all-female band disguised as women. Catching their eye is the band's vocalist & ukulele player as the two are instantly enticed by her beauty and compete for her affection while maintaining their disguises.Directed by Billy Wilder, the film carries a zestful atmosphere from the beginning & is full of hilarious moments that hold up pretty well even today. The screenplay is another work of quality that benefits greatly from Wilder's innate ability to infuse humour even in the most unexpected moments. Camera-work is fluid, editing is neat & music compliments its narrative excellently.Coming to the performances, the main cast comprises of Marilyn Monroe & her two bosom companions in Tony Curtis & Jack Lemmon. And although Monroe's performance may not be that enticing, her screen presence certainly is. Curtis & Lemmon also share an amazing chemistry together but the latter turns out to be an absolute live-wire in his given role & impressed the most.On an overall scale, Some Like It Hot has wonderfully endured the test of time and remains one of its genre's most enjoyable, entertaining & influential works. Over the years, its quality hasn't diminished by one bit, the funny moments are all the more refreshing & it continues to inspire endless comedies even to this date. A timeless classic, a cinematic treasure & still a red hot experience, Some Like It Hot is delightfully recommended.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Very entertaining!,"First thing, I want to start off by saying that I'm a big Marilyn Monroe fan. She is one of the most beautiful actresses ever to grace the big screen. I just finished watching Some Like It Hot for the first time. I recently bought the DVD. It's wonderful. I pat myself on the back for buying this movie without ever seeing it before. And if anyone hasn't seen it yet, I highly recommend it. Besides Monroe's great performance (she just wasn't another pretty face, you know), there are Tony Curtis' and Jack Lemmon's performances that are both excellent. My rating: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A comedy that did this!,"One of the most bold, clever, and hilarious comedies I have ever had the pleasure of watching! A film that made a choice that many would have considered a bit ""too ambitious"" or "" too outrageous"" for when it was made that choice being having two men dress and act like women. I definitely feel the idea of cross-dressing would be more acceptable in today's world despite some of society's/culture's differences on the matter, but making a choice such as cross-dressing back in 1959 was a very bold move. The story of the film is a cleverly written piece a comedy gold which combines not only humor but wit, amusement, and great direction. The comedy genre is probably one of the hardest genres to become acclaimed by both critics and audiences, whereas, other genres like dramas some times have easier when it comes being considered an acclaiming film. A well written script and dialogue exchanges all culminate into enjoyable performances from Monroe, Lemmon, Curtis and the rest the secondary cast members.Some Like It Hot is film that hits the mark in all the right places as a comedy film. Full of laughs and memorable moments that you can enjoy again and again. If you're looking for a good comedy to watch there's no need to look any further.

Irrepressibly funny and frantic film; excellent performances,"Billy Wilder's ""Some Like It Hot"" opens in 1929 Chicago and follows the desperation of musicians Joe ""Josephine"" (Tony Curtis) and Jerry ""Daphne"" (Jack Lemmon) to get out of town after witnessing the St. Valentine's Day massacre.  The solution?  Board a train to Miami posing as girls with an all-female band!  Everything about Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond's script is hilariously pitch-perfect, including the train sequence, the meeting of Daphne and Osgood Fielding (Joe E. Brown, whose closing line is a gem), and the yacht sequence with Joe and the sweetly dim-witted Sugar Kane (the incomparable Marilyn Monroe, who gives one of her best comic performances). Side-splitting support from George Raft, Pat O'Brien and Joan Shawlee add to the fun.  Oscar winner for Best B&W Costume design (Orry-Kelly).

"Timely, Tiresome, Stylish","It's impossible to approach SOME LIKE IT HOT without noting how timely it must have been in addressing the gender confusion barrier. ""Nobody's perfect"" could have been the motto of the hip liberalism that would hijack the next decade. It is slick, it is fun, and it is directed and written with Wilder's trademark arrogance. But does it deserve such a formidable spot among the ever-memorable comedies? Maybe so, for the unexplored timeliness alone.Wilder's most entertaining characteristic, once one gets used to seeing it, is his belief in universal idiocy. SOME LIKE IT HOT settles into some kind of saucy contempt for Y chromosomes before introducing Monroe's enduring archetype. I am reminded most in HOT of how her busty figure is an icon of days gone by. She is undone by the study in transsexuality, but still radiates even under the usual suppression of her brain. The plot tries to slyly maneuver her curves as if seducing her, but in stepping back we realize how surprisingly weak the story and characters are. The script - the ultimate Wilder - is 90% joke with a not-so-veiled dirtiness. Instead of spending dialogue time developing character, Wilder takes us on a 130 minute, cyclical, comedic joyride around the block of dramatic irony. Endlessly. We keep expecting the twist ending that we never get. It's a genius idea, one that wasn't his. And it doesn't convert into motion so well.Though it is aided by the fascinating experimentation with sexuality. Jack Lemmon's erratic hustle is enough to exhaust you. And we are met by Tony Curtis and his imitation of Cary Grant. It is Monkey Business without the complexity. But it is an astonishing impersonation and his subtlety comes as a welcome gift while being battered by Lemmon's anxiety. Lemmon might seem more comfortable in the dress, but which one do you notice throwing off his (her?) wig?But in the enormous dearth of character we see just how exceptional Wilder's writing had to be. And perhaps how magnetic the three primary players were.I'll also take this time to mention how refreshing it is to see musical realism. Actors gyrating in rhythm and actually passing off the impression that they can play their instruments is all too rare in Hollywood.75.3",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
No movie's perfect but I was pleasantly surprised.,"I never had high expectations for this movie. I want to believe a movie above a certain age can hold up but I guess I was a bit sour grapes about it because people kept heaping praise on it.There's an intelligence required to write goofy comedy and although a lot of this could be considered low brow, the impeccable sense of timing and efficiency in which the jokes are served and delivered is nothing short of admirable. A real comedy, not a veiled dramedy which is what Judd Apatow does. We get a cool plot that keeps as viewing and its snapshot of gender relations makes the whole thing seem enduringly relevant (but it was never meant to be a movie with a message; that's what's so awesome).The acting talent is amazing. Only Monroe maybe sort of falls short (yeah, I know). I get the impression she is a maestro at being the kind of character she's playing in real life; that sort of animated mannequin that men (including me admittedly) want to date so a lot of the time she is so on the money. But when it's time for her to do one of the more comedy orientated monologues the delivery seems to fall a bit flat. I think it might seem this way thanks to being surrounded by tons of better actors but she is certainly not bad and the script shines through.Frequently kind of eye-rollingly lame (like when they desperately use music to convey that Monroe is somehow more attractive than the other women present) but that does not change the majesty with which so much comedy, both physical and verbal, is flawlessly choreographed and realized (the train carriage scene springs to mind).",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Some Like It Hot on Reel 13,"It's interesting to me that, for a movie that is essentially silly and contrived at heart, SOME LIKE IT HOT works so well and holds up even today. I mean, as I'm sure you've heard if you've watched Thirteen at all this week, AFI recently named SOME LIKE IT HOT as the greatest American comedy of all-time. If the same movie were made today, I'm not sure it would fly. In today's more liberated society, men dressing up as women isn't that much of a novelty and it is my opinion that modern audiences would reject the coincidences that the plot hinges on (Lemmon and Curtis actually witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre AND the mob chasing them just happens to show up at the same hotel in Florida!). However, because it is from the fifties and in black and white, today's audiences tend to be a little more accepting, as if to assume that's they way things were done back then.While I don't agree that plot contrivance was a staple of 1950's cinema (though it is pre- eminent in a lot of Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond screenplays), I do agree that SOME LIKE IT HOT is a fabulous comedy. The key question is what makes it overcome those more absurd moments. It's not the performances. In spite of her iconic stature, Marilyn Monroe was never a very good actor and that remains true here. Tony Curtis is better imitating Cary Grant than he is at playing the Joe/Josephine character. Jack Lemmon doesn't disappoint and has many strong moments, even though when he is his Daphne make-up, his uncanny resemblance to The Joker from the BATMAN movies is very disconcerting.No, I think what makes SOME LIKE IT HOT work is outstanding, precise direction. Billy Wilder writes some great dialogue, but I think his most underrated contribution to cinema comedy is his sense of pace and comic timing. The way some of his stronger films move and seem to breathe give them an energy that keeps the audience involved in the story, but also, to some degree, hides the less plausible elements of the plot. Even some of his lesser work like ONE, TWO, THREE (the Reel 13 Classic from March 29th) relies heavily on alternating between freneticism and stoicism and knowing just when to employ each (Soderbergh calls it ""rhythm and release""). The staging of scenes borrow equally from Ernst Lubitsch (dialogue-driven) and Mack Sennett (physical comedy) to create this hybrid style that became all Wilder – a sort of modern farce that, in the case of SOME LIKE IT HOT, had particular resonance because of how it innocuously played with sexual conventions at a time when attitudes toward sex and sexuality were starting to shift.Most importantly, however, is that SOME LIKE IT HOT is just great fun. Smart dialogue, sharp direction, disguises, mistaken identity – the works, all executed with great deftness and care. While I disagree that SOME LIKE IT HOT is the greatest comedy of all time (haven't they seen AIRPLANE?) or that it is Billy Wilder's best film (see last week's blog for THE APARTMENT), it's still a fabulous, memorable movie that in spite of its penchant for silliness, will probably live forever.(For more information on this or any other Reel 13 film, check out their website at www.reel13.org)",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A timeless classic that should be seen many times,"How many reviews have been written about Some Like It Hot? Probably hundreds if not thousands, so there is t much new or relevant to add here, yet I took a risk to add mine here too, however rather than praising Marilyn Monroe in one of her finest hours, and 3 roles played in seamless unison by Tony Curtis, to me and some other reviewers, SLIH owes much of its enduring brilliance to Jack Lemmon's tour-de-force performance as Jerry, the hapless bassist who becomes ""Daphne"" in a desperate attempt to evade the mob. Lemmon's physical comedy, impeccable timing, and expressive face make him the heart of Billy Wilder's screwball classic.As Daphne, Lemmon is simply sensational - a whirlwind of energy, impeccable comedic timing and legendary one liners delivered the way only he could do. Whether it's his gleeful delight in bonding with the all-female band or his escalating panic as Osgood Fielding III pursues him, Lemmon commits to every moment with infectious enthusiasm. His comedic genius is most evident in the iconic tango scene, where his escalating exasperation and eventual resignation to Osgood's courtship are played to perfection.Yet beyond just the laughs, it's an emotional depth that Lemmon brings to this role, imbuing Jerry with a lovable vulnerability that balances the absurdity. His chemistry with Tony Curtis and Marilyn Monroe elevates SLIH into a stratosphere of chaos and power of some of the funniest films ever made, but it's Lemmon's fearless, unique, larger-than-life performance that in my humble opinion transforms Some Like It Hot from just an amazingly crafted and executed comedies into one of the greatest films of all time and an enduring classic that transcends the time and deserves repeat watchings!",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Another Wilder Winner!,"Billy Wilder's 1959 comedy Some Like It Hot is honestly something else. While not my favorite movie in the long career spanning decades for Wilder, this is still an outrageous comedy featuring three very fine performances and a subject that went against social taboos at the time. This is a screwball comedy that is often compared to films created by the Marx Brothers. While I see the comparisons as easy as the light of day, Wilder's film resonates more thematically. As for the three leads, Marilyn Monroe has never been sexier, Tony Curtis has never been cooler, and this is Jack Lemmon at the height of his career. The film did not speak to me like other Wilder's films (The Apartment is a great one) because not all the jokes work, and the pacing can be slow at times. Still, there is no denying the presence it has in the canon of the best, influential movies. And the ending? Loved it! When Osgood quotes, ""Well, nobody's perfect"" to Lemmon's bewildered face to end the movie, I nearly choked on my own laughter. More than sixty years later, that ending remains perfect. You cannot beat an ending like that! It floors me because this was not even supposed to be the original ending. Wilder and company was just not able to come up with anything better.On one hand, it is surprising that film was given the go-ahead from a major studio to make the movie because it tackles themes in the LBQT community such as crossdressing among other topics. On the other hand, the Hays Code which was strictly enforced for decades was losing its steam. It was not phased out until the mid-1960's, but no one really cared about the code. Despite not receiving assistance from the office and given a ""morally objectionable"" rating from the Roman Catholic Church, that did not stop Wilder. I believe Wilder honored these topics with gentle and care. Even though this is a comedy, he did not make mockery of the subjects. I also find it fascinating how the film was originally supposed to be filmed in color. But Wilder and Monroe agreed the two gentlemen looked ghastly in drag when filmed in color, so black-and-white it was. A great decision because the cinematography is awfully good. Wilder's and I. A. L Diamond's script is mostly good. Most of my issues stem around the film's pacing, but I did not Wilder's addition of the gangster subplot. Added a more gritty flavor to the comedy.Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) are two Chicago musicians. Unfortunate for them, they witnessed the St. Valentine's Day massacre which was organized by gangster Spats Columbo (George Raft). They needed to leave town, but the only gig they could find is an all-girl's band. At the train station, they show up as Josephine and Daphne as the band's replacement players. They enjoy being around the ladies, in particular Sugar Kane Kowalczyk (Marilyn Monroe) who sings. Joe is the lucky man (ahem) who sets out to woo her while Jerry is being wooed by a millionaire, Osgood Fielding (Joe E. Brown). As the two friends try to keep their identities secret, it does not help them knowing that the gangsters are always nearby on the search for them.The film worked because of the three leads. Despite the eccentricities regarding Monroe's work, she delivered a very sexy performance that might be career best. There have been many rumors surrounding Monroe about the film including her kissing ability. When she is onscreen, she mesmerizes you with her beauty and personality. Tony Curtis and especially Jack Lemmon get to work with the screwball element to great effect. The two men have great chemistry and watching them in these wacky situations is hilarious. The ending is the best in terms of Lemmon and the millionaire who has been trying to woo him. The movie has a formidable supporting cast led by Pat O'Brien and George Raft, who in particular has not been in an A-list picture for years.Overall, Some Like It Hot is definitely a great movie. Personally, it falls short of ""classic"" territory because of pacing issues. I did find to enjoy beginning with the performances and Wilder's confident direction. The influence it had for the future of cinema is undeniable. If the film was proposed even a decade earlier, there is no way it would have been made. Not my favorite Wilder picture, but it still ranks high on the list. Tells you what kind of director Wilder is. Definitely see it!My Grade: B+",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Gentle side,"Ok, I have watched ""Some Like It Hot"" (1959). The film has warmed my heart by: how gentle depiction of men in this old relic of a film from the time of stifling gender expectations, 24 hour dress code, and how dexterous were the screenwriters to sneak the themes banned by Hollywood censorship (Hays_Code), partly for quite absurd reasons .The film managed to work around the outlaw of ""any inference of sex perversion"", which can be loosely defined to harm LGBTQ+ community. It forced male characters to dress in the clothing made usual for an opposite sex to favor the censors. However, in a slant way, the film told a story of gradual transformation of men into more gentle and sincere versions of themselves, giving the protagonists a sneek peek into the mysterios world of the opposite sex, which, as it turned out, was not that opposite, and breaking the ""men are from Mars, women are from Venus"" stereotype.To summarize, ""Some Like It Hot"" is frequently makes ways to empathize with female hardships burdened by the society of 1950s and not at all ridiculous attempt to tell a story about female/male cross-dressing, especially considering its date and the successors that followed the similar theme.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

"""I understand you're looking for a couple of girl musicians""","Inspired by the 1935 French film ""Fanfare of Love"": Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) are struggling musicians in Chicago during the Prohibition era in the late 1920s. After unintentionally witnessing a crime, they have to hide by changing their names (and appearances) to Josephine and Daphne and join an all-female band that is on its way to Miami. Once in the band, both are smitten by the lead singer and ukulele player, Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe).This film succeeds greatly as a mix of various genres and excelling in all of them: crime drama, love story, and ultimately one of the funniest comedies ever with many hilarious lines by screenwriters Billy Wilder (also the film's director) and I. A. L. Diamond. The film also includes a lot of fine music highlighted by Monroe's singing voice.Among many things to love, the highlights include Curtis' female voice plus his ability to play three roles (he also plays a fake heir to an oil corporation in order to woo Sugar); Monroe's portrayal as someone so lovesick and vulnerable that she is totally unaware of the power of her goddess-like beauty; Lemmon's hyper-nervous energy and all the trouble that follows including being relentlessly chased by a millionaire named Osgood (Joe E. Brown, also hilarious) who is in love with ""Daphne""; the night of tango dancing between Daphne and Osgood plus Daphne's recall of the events later that night to Joe; and ultimately, the overnight train trip from Chicago to Miami. The train scene has many moments of hilarity and shows Lemmon at his comical best. And its climactic ending is the icing on the cake.Other performers in this great cast include George Raft as a crime boss, Joan Shawlee as the band leader, and Dave Barry as the band's manager.A delight worthy of all its praises. - dbamateurcriticRATING: 9 out of 10OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS:Directing by Billy WilderActing Ensemble.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

A genuine classic,"I'm almost 50 years old, and I've been hearing about this film for the better part of my life, but never got around to seeing it until recently. I figured it had to be overrated--I mean, two guys in drag, once you've done the standard jokes, what else is there?--but it's a wonderful movie, well worth its reputation. The early Chicago scenes are fairly ordinary (and in fact the gangster bits never really catch fire), but once the boys get into their outfits the film never lets up. Tony Curtis got a lot of ridicule early in his career, but he was a very good comic actor, and his Cary Grant fake millionaire is simply hilarious. Marilyn Monroe is luminous as always, and perfectly cast as the archetypal sweet dumb amorous blonde. Jack Lemmon's acting has always been a bit too mannered for my taste, but once he cuts loose in the second half he's great. The real star of the show, though, is the script, which brings the laugh lines tumbling fast and furious, and gets more out of the old premise than you could ever expect. Add Wilder's relentless farce pacing, and you have a true classic. Don't wait most of your life to see it.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

so the one legged jockey said...,"This morning I woke up smiling and that was due to watching this film the night before. I hadn't seen this in quite some time, but Lord knows how many times I have in my lifetime and some of it can still make me laugh out loud. This tale of two musicians dressed as women in an all girl band due to running from jazz age gangsters has many times been called the greatest comedy ever made. It may not get the laughs it once did, but it probably deserves that title. Despite the endless tales of the difficulties in filming it, there is just nothing wrong with it. It is smart, funny, well acted, superbly written and it just gets better as it rolls along. This is not Marilyn Monroe's best performance, but she is perfect for the role and this is definitely the best film she was ever in. She truly dazzles. Tony Curtis does well as one half of this drag duo, but he is no match for the comedic talents of his co-star, Jack Lemmon, who is sensational. Lemmon had one of the greatest careers in Hollywood, won two Oscars, but for my money, this may be his finest hour in a career full of them. Thanks to him, the writing and directing, the upper berth and engagement scenes are among the gems in the history of Hollywood film comedies. This film just never gets old. It is simply a comic masterpiece from the great Billy Wilder whose direction was nominated for an Oscar, but not the film itself, one of the most glaring omissions in the Academy's history, though they have quite a few of them and this one is near the very top.

The truth reveal would require another like 20 minutes of the movie dedication, but this all happened within the matters of some minutes, in general Monroe and Osgood from the beginning were introduced in a way, so the even when main characters reveal their true self through very simple plot, viewers could not go through some unlogical plot twist. In general, location actors Mafia and Blonde were perfect mix, the only and most outstanding element that made this movie so flawless in my eyes, is the scenario.

Billy Wilders has a perfect command over the screwball genre,"In my review of ""Parasite"" (2019, Bong Joon Ho) I said that mixing crime and comedy is best done by Joel and Ethan Coen. Now I have to admit that also Billy Wilder understands this job.In ""Some like it hot"" the mix is heavily tilted towards comedy, the role of crime being limited to giving an inducement. But that does not diminish the achievement of Wilder in any way. I have long evaded this film because I am not a great lover of comedy's with men in women's cloth. They tend to be rather silly ans insiped. Think of films as ""Tootsie"" (1982, Sydney Pollack) and ""Mrs Doubtfire"" (1993, Chris Columbus) not to speak of a play like ""Charlie's aunt"". It is the merit of Billy Wilder but also of his main actors that they make such a funny film out of such an antiquated concept. When the story moves from Chicago to the seaside of Florida it almost becomes a naughty version of ""Les vacances de Mrs Hulot"" (1953, Jacques Tati).I already mentioned the main actors. They all did a splendid job. Jack Lemmon was at the peak of his career and would make ""The apartment"" the next year (aslo with Billy Wilder). Tony Curtis, often casted for his good looks in the beginning of his career, had proven his ability for serious acting in ""Sweet smell of success"" (1957, Alexander Mackendrick) and ""The defiant ones"" (1958, Stanley Kramer) in the previous years. For Marilyn Monroe it is one of her last appearances. She is still sexy and innocent at the same time, as if fully unaware of the effect that her body has on men. In ""Some like it hot"" she sings ""I wanna be loved by you"" in a very sensuous way, dressed in a robe that shows (almost offers) her breasts in the most advantageous way.During the film two relationships evolve. One is between Jack Lemon as Daphne and Joe Brown as an old millionaire. In this relationship Joe does not know that Daphne in reality is a man. This relationship is hardcore screwball, but on a very high level. The other relationship is between Marilyn Monroe as Sugar Kane and Tony Curtis playing a fake milliionaire. In this relationship Marilyn does not know that Tony Curtis in reality doesn't have a dime. This relationship outgrows the screwball character and even becomes a real romance. Especially poignant is that the Marilyn Monroe character says she always falls in love with the wrong men and is finally looking for a serious and quiet one. Just as in real life one is inclined to think.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Lots of fun,"Marilyn Monroe looks so happy in this film; I just love her in it. Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are great too, alternating between annoyance at finding themselves harassed by pathetic men (where it's nice to see the shoe on the other foot) and trying to control their libidos around the all-female band they've joined to escape some gangsters. Lemmon gets off all sorts of barbed comments, either catty or lusty, which he delivers perfectly, and he has a hilarious tango scene with his 70-year-old suitor (Joe E. Brown). Meanwhile Curtis is funny too, playing the voice of reason until he goes after Monroe's character with a Cary Grant impression, and convinces her to keep kissing him so that he'll ""feel something."" (hello) Wilder's pace is fantastic, and the laughs and titillation seem non-stop. I loved the little in-joke George Raft got in as well; he's a gangster who notices a young tough repeatedly flipping a coin up in the air, and asks him derisively where he learned such a cheap trick. It was Raft, of course, in Scarface (1932) who was so iconic doing that. Just a witty, fun film - and a brilliant ending too.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Tony Curtis deserves a lot of credit for playing the male suitor to Marilyn Monroe's Sugar. Even though Jack Lemmon is hysterical as Daphne, you can't forget how giddy and happy he is when he finds love with a male suitor played wonderfully by Joe E. Brown. I forget who plays the female conductor but she's also wonderful in the film. It's sad that Marilyn Monroe died so young only three years after making this wonderful classic film.

"An expert mixture of comedy, tension, sex, and romance","This movie is about as pure entertainment as movies can get. It's an expert mixture of comedy, tension, sex, and romance that creates such a complete package of good times that Hollywood has very rarely come close to matching. Working with I.A.L. Diamond for the second time after Love in the Afternoon, Billy Wilder crafted an essentially perfect film.Set during Prohibition, we follow two jazz musicians after they witness a gangland murder and try to run for their lives. They're broke and can't even pay to get to a regular job 100 miles from Chicago much less fund an escape from the mob, so they do the only logical thing. They dress up like women and join an all-female band headed to Florida for three weeks. The two have been so consumed with bare survival in the winter of Chicago where they could only ever find unsteady work, that romance has been a secondary objective for a long time. Suddenly thrown into a train car with a dozen beautiful women including Sugar Kane (played perfectly by Marilyn Monroe), the two don't need to worry about feeding themselves or the back rent on their apartment or the coats they lost in a bet at a dog race.Jerry, played by Jack Lemmon, embraces his femininity fully while also embracing the potential for sexual escapades. Joe, played by Tony Curtis, is a bit more forward thinking and knows that if they give away the game they'll be off the train and ready to freeze to death in the winter cold. Jerry sees their escape as an excuse to have fun, but since none of the other women on the train are suspicious of them, they treat the two like any other girl, ruining Jerry's attempt to have a surprise party with Sugar Kane by piling into his single berth in a display of absurdism that still feels completely natural in the film.Two romances develop in the film. The first is between Joe and Sugar. It was Jerry who originally tried to make a lustful move towards the innocently sensual Sugar, but it's Joe who makes a concerted effort to win her heart. He's a man in a disguise who takes up another disguise (as a millionaire) while she is a woman who professes a need for a millionaire but also admits that she can't help herself around saxophone players (which Joe is). They're both lying about who they are to the other. Sugar is lying to both herself and to Joe's alter ego, Junior, about what she wants while Joe is lying to Sugar about who he is. The mutual lies end up canceling each other out in a way.Jerry gets the second romance, this one with a real millionaire, Osgood Fielding III (played wonderfully by Joe E. Brown). He's a serial husband looking for his next wife (either eighth or ninth, only his mother keeps an accurate count), and he's smitten by Daphne, Jerry's alter-ego. Joe ends up bullying Jerry into playacting for Fielding in order to help Joe woo Sugar. The dual scene of Joe's reversed seduction of Sugar and the night out that Fielding and Jerry share is a marvelous display of contrasts. Joe is playing an impotent (maybe homosexual) rich dandy who needs Sugar Kane's feminine wiles to bring him back to life, so to speak. She tries with all of her innocently sexual energy. At the same time, Jerry and Fielding are dancing in a Cuban nightclub, Jerry accidentally leading at times while they grow closer in synch to the point where they can perfectly transfer a rose stem from one mouth to the other. It's a perfect mesh of comedic visuals with narrative push, driving the absurd romances on both sides forward.The action of the film comes to a head when the gangsters from Chicago coincidentally have a get together with mobs from across the country in the same Florida hotel. The slapstick nature of two men dressed in drag running from gangsters reaches its peak here, embracing the absurdity with both arms fully. The resolution to the two romances is rather perfect as well. Joe and Sugar shedding their mutual deceit and falling into each other's arms in the back of Fielding's boat while Fielding dismisses all of Daphne's flaws as acceptable, even the fact that Daphne is actually Jerry.Never has Wilder's common motif of masks and deception been more explicit than in Some Like it Hot (though The Major and the Minor comes close). He uses it to great comedic effect, crafting one of Hollywood's great comedies that feels as fresh in 2019 as it surely did in 1959.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

"Predictable, but silly","It was hard to believe all that Some Like It Hot' got away with in the 1950's. Sexual innuendos, cross-dressing, barely their `clothes' and more definitely made it an eyebrow-raising movie.  It was risqué, but it's what made it such a funny movie.  Marilyn Monroe did as excellent job at playing a dumb blonde (If she was really acting at all) and Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon did a superb job playing two cross-dressers trying to win a pretty girl's heart.  Marilyn Monroe played a sweet, innocent girly-girl in an all-female band who every guy wanted, especially Joe and Jerry (Curtis and Lemmon).  The two struggling musicians meet Sugar (Monroe) after they witness the St. Valentines Day Massacre and need to flee from the mob that is out to kill them.  The only way to escape from being killed is to cross-dress and join the all-female band.  The idea isn't too bad when they find out that Sugar is apart of the band.  The girls in the band seem fresh out of seventh grade: boy-crazy and naïve, though it didn't seem to bother Joe and Jerry whose alias' while being cross-dressers where Josephine and Daphne.  Even though the two guys were trying to win over Sugar while somehow remaining cross-dressers, it seemed to me that they were having a little more fun playing dress up than other guys would.  I think they became too comfortable as women and it was kind of creepy, but also very humorous.  While Jerry was having more success getting closer to Sugar and becoming more of her confidante, Joe was having more success in unintentionally wooing a rich yacht owner named Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown).  This twisted comedy made me laugh the whole way through.  The mishaps and misfortunes of the characters were very inventive.  I thought that the ending was very witty and although I could see the direction that it was headed, I didn't think any other ending would have been as funny. Although, it didn't take incredibly talented actors to pull off a comedy such as Some Like It Hot', it is still a movie that I would watch again and again.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Brown, Late Joan Shawlee and Late Nehemiah Persoff.Two male musicians flee the state disguised as women in an all-female band after witnessing a murder. They thinks that they have avoided trouble but their destiny has another plans.Wow what a funny, bone tickling feel good funny film. The premise of the film might not be that fresh but the execution is surely top notch. The film will not only keep you engaged but also will keep a smile on your face with the dose of laughter in between. The film can surely be called as pure unadulterated fun.The acting in the film is superb and for me it was Jack Lemmon who was probably the best of them all. Tony Curtis was also spot on with his acting. Marilyn Monroe looked pretty and cute in the role of an innocent ukulele player and singer. Joe E. Brown performance works as an icing on the cake. Rest of the cast was also good.Screenplay of the film is gripping and funny and hilarious and climax was superb. Can surely be watched many timesOne of the best feel good comedy film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Billy Wilder goes wild!!!,"With a great cast, funny moments and the greatness of Billy Wilder, ""Some Like It Hot"" is a really funny movie! Forget these ""comedies"" of today which are actually unfunny, ""Some Like It Hot"" is hilarious! This film has a great cast: Marilyn Monroe (who acted in another Billy Wilder comedy, ""The Seven Year Itch""), Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon. The humor is simply hilarious and lacks the toilet humor and vulgarity of today's ""comedies"". But according to me, it is one of the amazing and wildest farces ever made in Hollywood by a wilder director! This one of the funniest comedies ever made!!!It is just silly but lacks the raunch or grossness of today's ""comedies"" such as ""Wedding Crashers"". It's the funniest comedy film ever made in Hollywood history!",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Suspend Your Disbelief and Have Some Fun,"There is plenty about this comedy with music that stands the test of time. Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis play musicians who are being pursued by gangsters because they have witnessed a murder. Masquerading as women, they go on tour with an all-girl band. Marilyn Monroe sings ""Runnin' Wild"" on a train to Florida, and the rest is movie history. How do the guys shave? How do they fool anyone with those ridiculous wigs? Does Jack Lemmon actually put out for Joe E. Brown? Don't ask. Just suspend your disbelief and have some laughs.The most obvious ethnic references in this comedy are to Italians, since it is set during Prohibition and the heyday of the mafia, but there is also a Polish connection. Once Curtis and Lemmon join the all-girl band on its way to a gig in Florida, enter Monroe as a ""dumb blonde"" who identifies herself as Sugar Kane, adding that ""I changed it from Sugar Kowalczyk."" ""Polish?"" she is asked. ""Yes, I come from this musical family. My mother's a piano teacher. My father was a conductor."" To the question ""Where did he conduct?"" she replies, ""On the Baltimore and Ohio."" In the end, the dizzy Polish girl from Sandusky, Ohio, turns out to have a heart of gold, and she gets her man with her well displayed sex appeal. In the bargain, Marilyn Monroe gets to appear in what is considered one of the most enduringly funny movies ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Still very funny,"What is rare and special about this movie is that it is still very funny and stylish to look at. What it also provides us with is a comedy chemistry on film between Curtis and Lemmon which probably can only be rivalled by Lemmon and Matthau( the old black and white partnerships have badly dated in style and content). The story is slow to get going but once it starts there is no flagging as the two stars belt out oneliners with a coolness and sharpness which done today would look tiresome and tacky. There are just so many memorable lines like ""nobody's perfect"", ""Shell Oil"" and ""absolutely nothing"" which taken in context of the film and depending on your mood can really make you laugh. In terms of Marilyn's performance though, the film is oddly moving in a strange sort of way. She cuts a charming, beautiful figure due to her looks, vulnerability and naivety. She just wants someone un- complicated and descent to love and marry her but can not find this as her beauty and sultriness  makes her too intimidating for these men.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Some like it hot,"What I liked: Very ahead of its time in its message. Including depictions of homosexuality, cross dressing and most importantly the female gaze. It also went against the hays code and was one of the films attributed to ending the code. It's funny and entertaining throughout. Jack Lemon is very funny in it and his comedy style is still replicated today.What I disliked: It's a bit silly for my usual viewing. There are some real high points in it and as a result parts of the film fall slightly flat in comparison.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
This movie is great art,"There is a number of movies which may be considered to attain the same level of super-masterpiece as ""Some Like it Hot"", showing that cinema can really be great art. It depends by personal tastes: a common choice could be ""The Seventh Seal"", ""Citizen Kane"", ""Alexandr Nevsky"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" etc. By sure, no film can claim to be better than ""Some Like it Hot"". In movie history, it is impossible to overcome it in the quality of the story, of the photography, of the costumes, of the music, of the direction, of the performances and charisma of the actors, of the careful and evocative reconstruction of the roaring twenties. What about the script? This is beyond any description, pure art, work of genius at his highest level. OK, the plot is not realistic... well, is Mozart's ""Magic Flute"" realistic? Some works of art are just not involved with realism. I deliberately pass over the fact that Wilder's masterpiece is also one of the funniest movies ever made: art may be tragic or comic or what else. It doesn't matter: it remains art. Such being my opinions on the movie, one can figure that I was almost annihilated gathering from IMDb comments that some dislike it! Well... I guess we can discover even people considering Marilyn an ugly woman...",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Old but still funny to this day,"Some like it hot is a old classic movie from 1959. It may be black and white but that does not change the fact how funny this movie is. When I started watching this movie i thought what have i got myself into but then i realised the movie pact full of jokes that still land today. Some like it hot is about to men watch a murder happen in a ally way as the only witnesses they flew to Florida to play in a music band to hide from the gang members that did the murder. sadly the music band was only for girls so the 2 boys had to put make up on and dress up as girls to also enjoy the trip to Florida, but something they can not hide is there love for Suger the hot guitar player in the group.

The Best movie ever made! My all time favorite...,"This is my favorite movie of all time, and I am a movie buff, so this movie is really good!! Jack Lemmon and Joe E. Brown are fantastic and funny. He and Tony Curtis give award winning performances as does Marilyn Monroe. Rent it today, never mind that it is 40 years old. It still entertains me when I watch it. Run to the video store!!!",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
It's fantastic!,"I have seen this movie a number of times. Why? Because it's great. Monroe (even though she can't sing) turns on a dazzling performance. Curtis & Lemmon are also outstanding in their performances. But the acting would be nothing without an enormously hilarious script from Diamond & Wilder. The direction is worth a mention too; it is tight, snappy and the movie runs apace without a dull spot. Wilder is at his best as producer. Laugh? I nearly died :-)",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Just awful!,"I continue to be amazed by people who crow about this movie.  The plot is tortured and trite.  The characters are predictable and boring. The comedy is juvenile. The acting is insipid. Marilyn Monroe, though it is now fashionable to say she was a great comedic actress, is painfully bad.This is one of those movies that everyone says they like so that they can fit in with their friends who say they like it--even if they don't like it either.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
an odd coincidence,"I just learned today in the New Yorker magazine, that in 1937 Cole Porter was in a horse riding accident in which his legs were severely damaged, the New Yorker says: ""but Porter's talent for masquerade, for turning life's griefs and glories into an impudent game, didn't end there. In gruelling pain for decades after the accident, forced to walk with braces and canes, he nonetheless had the humor to give his lame legs names: the left he christened JOSEPHINE, the right GERALDINE,"" ***(KING COLE by JOHN LAHR The not so merry soul of Cole Porter. Issue of 2004-07-12 and 19 Posted 2004-07-05)***These are the names that Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon decided upon before Jack decided that he'd rather be Daphne. Is that a strange coincidence or what?",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
HOW DID THEY GET AWAY WITH IT?,Some like it hot written and directed in the 50's is a very sexually orientated movie. One from this time period generally thinks of the 50's as a very clean a pure time area with the classic nuclear family as it's backbone but this movie portrays a much different image and with Marilyn Monroe as the staring actress succeeds. This movie does something most people never thought of when they thought of the 50's these things include cross dressing and gay relationships. This movie is a mixture of a comedy and a love story. Shot in black and white this movie at first glance to be a classic film but as the viewer watches they relies that it most certainly is not your classic 50's film. The plot of this movie is very see through and has nothing really to it but the viewer can't help but appreciate it for the way it affected society and T.V today.,,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Desired and pretending to not like it,"Lubitsch, at around the time this film is set, would do something like this with a frothy Viennese aroma. There would be no mob subplot and no one gunned down, and just endlessly suggestive twirling with the embroidered limits of social appearances. Soon the French young upstarts at Cahiers would do it with youthful style and lots of cinematic annotation around acting and images.Here we're stuck with a revue, effortlessly smooth but the jokes are broad and corny, the improvised skits are forced without breath. The appeal is more or less the same all these years later. Monroe captured with a naive purity that has become the image of who we like to think she was, and kept just a little off center so that we yearn for each next voluptuous appearance. Men in drag, musicians that flee with a girls jazz band to Florida to escape the mob, so that we can pretend to inhabit for a while what it means to be desired.Classic in this case means older and the material is not much better than an Appatow film.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
NOT The greatest comedy ever!!,"This film is NOT funny, some would consider this as a slight weakness to the greatest comedy ever, as many have voted this film to be. it took the final line at the end of the movie to make me consider laughing. I cannot understand why there have not been more comments like this. perhaps it is just the respect for its age and actors that have earnt the movie this title, but as for being the funniest film ever, i found at most five points in the film were someone might laugh , I myself find comedies such as the Farrely bros funnier, since they make me laugh!!",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Sad,"This is nothing but warmed up vaudeville, a one-joke farce without any message. Far better movies on a similar subject are ""The Gay Deceivers"" (1969) and ""La Cage Aux Folles II"". The fact that men dressed as women are thought to be so hilarious says something about our view of women. Why are women dressed as men not hilarious? Food for thought.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A familiar plot that never keeps you guessing,"Lets face it.  This film is the same story everyone and their dog has seen athousand times and more.Two losers cross-dressing to do what they can to reach the big time ateveryones expense is very familiar.  Well, maybe minus the cross-dressing. But it is relevant to that plot line where someone is acting like something they're not to reach that same goal.  Frankly, it's over-used.This reviewer has seen too many of these plot lines that it just doesn't strike me as entertaining anymore.  But on a positive point, it still deserves a few laughs, which this film was able to deliver.Movies today are becoming repetitious, and this reviewer feels that for the good of the industry that plot lines should be revisited fewer so new ones can bemade.  Even if it means a third rate sequel.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Recommended, but with caveats...","This is a highly enjoyable film if taken for what it is...a late fifties madcap comedy.It's a good comedy, maybe even a great comedy, but if you watch it expecting to be bowled over by the finest comedy film ever made then you will be very, very disappointed.It's Lemmon's film by a country mile, with a wonderful performance. Curtis hams it up wonderfully as well, though you'll find his 'legendary' Cary Grant impersonation either hilarious or irritatingly awful (I hated it!).Monroe is completely forgettable throughout, and I'm sure for that comment alone people will entirely disregard this review.This film IS funny, but it would really pain me to think that two men in dresses is still the funniest thing that a century of cinema has to offer the world.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Who play Ukulele in a Jazz Band!!!!,"Some Like it Hot is a film in which stars Tony Curtis as Joe (Josephine) Junior, Jack Lemmon as Jerry (Daphne), and Marilyn Monroe as Sugar Kane Kowalczyk. This is a comedy that was a bit out of the ordinary for its time. It blends a lot of sexuality, taboo, comedy, and just down right dirtiness. Some Like It Hot was much entertaining, most likely due to the fact that Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are dressed as women for most of the movie. How could that not be funny? Although not being very witty comedy, it involves somewhat of `slap stick' comedy in the movie, which is good for all the viewers how get a kick out of that. It is easy to know why this movie was such a hit. The first scene that Sugar is introduced, she pretty much steals the show and has every guy glued to screen. It was very disappointing to find out that the title of the movie has no meaning whatsoever to what is being seen in the actually film itself. Although what movie with Marilyn Monroe has to have much meaning, honestly? One comes to find out this is an obvious fact when it turns out to be that she plays a UKULELE in a JAZZ BAND for crying out loud. Come on! Overall, the film was entertaining. I give it 7 out of 10 stars because it was entertaining enough not to put me to sleep. I do not recommend this film to any younger viewer for the use of extensive sexual innuendoes and sexual humor.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
white chicks,"I just passed by this page and noticed that the 2004 wayans bros movie is an exact copy of Some Like It Hot. From the 'rich guy who wan't take no for an answer' to the 'impressing the girl with the yacht he doesn't have.' I don't want to compare such a classic movie to such a bad one as white chicks, but it is the spitting image (plot only). I think they're running out of ideas up there in Hollywood. I was just comparing the summary's of both the movies. The guys have different reasons for dressing up like woman, but the same thing happens to them, one is afraid to tell the girl that he loves, that he's really a guy, and the other gets stuck with a rich guy in love with him, thinking he's a girl. Now also the movie, Sorority Boys has the same kind of plot, not exact as the other too, but still. Guys dress up as girls, fall in love...etc.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
One little mistake,"Sorry but NOBODY is perfect. Although I adore this movie, and count it to the ten best comedies of the XX. Century, as a passionate Florida tourist I´m always a little disappointed, that they didn´t do the outdoor filming on original location but in California. This wouldn´t be that disturbing if you couldn´t see the actual California coastline at the horizon during the first beach scene and everyone who´ve been to Florida knows there are definitely NO cliffs at all at the Floridian coast. This is the only small mistake I find in this all-time classic, and when I read some of the bad comments (I´m really astonished that there are actually some of them!) I think those people should better watch ""There´s something about Mary"" or other comedies dedicated to mediocre tastes. Those who seriously consider the screenplay and the dialogue a bad one have absolutely NO idea what defines a good script and a good movie. I give this comedy-highlight (despite the california blooper) a 10.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Classic, Maybe; Dated, Certainly; Dishonest, Basically","I recently watched this movie for the first time as a sort of tribute to the late lamented Billy Wilder, having heard it was his best comedy.  I agree there is much to admire in the plotting & pacing of this ""madcap farce,"" and also that one is inclined to forgive inconsistencies such as how Tony Curtis can put on, a few hours later, an immaculate blazer previously plunged into a soapy bathtub (& which was cadged from the luggage of a much shorter, plumper man).   BUT I have one large objection: the scene in which Tony Curtis attempts to seduce Marilyn Monroe by telling her that he is naturally not attracted to women, thereby prompting HER to attempt to seduce HIM, really suffers from the datedness of the arch approach to what could be discussed freely today: is he, or does he fear he is, a homosexual?  In order to persuade him that he is a sexually ""normal"" male, she kisses him repeatedly.   She does NOT do what any normal woman (in 1929, the supposed time setting, or 1959, the actual setting) would have done: take off some clothes & wait for him to have an erection.   Because, you will tell me, of the movie code of the '50s, she has to let her kisses represent a series of more erotic actions.   However, we are left unconvinced even by this metaphoric seduction, because we wonder, notably, how could Tony Curtis not respond to the luscious Monroe even in the filming of this scene (where she is lying on top of him), how could ""Joe"" school himself not to respond to ""Sugar,"" how could even a neurotically frigid male (such as Curtis is pretending to be) not respond for SO long?  It's odd that all the scenes involving men pretending to be women work well, but this one supposedly ""heterosexual"" scene strains credulity on every level.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"A bright, fast comedy--but with a little sex.","At this point, Some Like It Hot has more than enough comments torecommend it. What I am amazed at is the detractors. I can onlyguess that a generation of network zit-coms has numbed theirbrains. This movie is well constructed. It has some of the wittiestdialogue ever. Lines that are thrown away here would be gobbledup and turned to whole movies by other filmmakers. Every setuphas a very funny payoff. The timing of the acting and the editing isexquisite.

Smashing good time,"In a time of prohibition the streets of Chicago are littered with thugs and crime lords. During this time Joe (Tom Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) are struggling musicians trying to find work. Though when the two get mixed up with the mafia they must lay low, so they end up traveling to Florida in Cognito as `women' in an all-girl band. Not to mention one of the ladies is Sugar (Marilyn Monroe).This was a grand comedy directed by Billy Wilder. The topics brought up in the flick were pretty borderline for its time. The mix of a couple songs here and there from Marilyn was kind of cool. As they flick moved along it started to get more interesting.Now, would I recommend this flick to everyone? No it is only good for people, who want to see a fun comedy. This isn't the greatest, but I enjoyed it while it lasted.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Doesn't quite hold up,"I understand it's a classic, but this doesn't quite hold up all these many years later.

what's the big deal about marilyn?,"Some Like It Hotthe perfect title to fit this movie, if anyone is shocked by Britney Spears then they'll be just as shocked by Marilyn Monroe, the only thing is this movie is set many years ago when swimsuits were more like body suits.  Growing up with the `Britney Icon', nothing could seemed to have shocked this reviewer, but Marilyn's even dresses and lingerie were making this reviewer cringe and very uncomfortable.  Despite Marilyn's ensemble, this is a well written story with fun little twists and turns. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon steal the show even though the famous Marilyn Monroe is also part of the cast.Marilyn Monroe is remembered as this super sexy woman with class and innocence, after watching the movie the phrase `dumb blonde' comes to mind. This woman is all about sex appeal and her acting skills aren't exactly all that impressive.  Not to mention her blondeness comes from a bottle of peroxide, she comes across as cheap and easy, not the innocent girl who just keeps falling for the wrong guy.Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, however, are true class acts.  They pull off a good fake out and truly could be confused as women ugly and oversized, but women none-the-less.  They make a great duo and could easily be seen as best friends outside of the set, their chemistry is great and their acting even better.The storyline is a fun one, two traveling musicians following their dream and living from paycheck to paycheck, not willing to give up their hopes but really hitting rock bottom.  Then, wham!  They witness a crime, mafia related of course, and need to escape for their lives.  The only opportunity provided for an escape is being part of an all female band heading for Florida, these 2 Chicago boys have to then become cross-dressers to take up the opportunity.  This is then when they meet Sugar (Marilyn Monroe) and the rest is history.  There are a few interesting close calls and a funny ending to make this movie a worthwhile viewing.All-in-all this is a movie that deserves to be seen by anyone interested in a light-hearted comedy, even though Marilyn is a bit racy and, well, annoying. Some Like It Hot is a must see and comes high recommended from this reviewer.  Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis bring this movie full circle and make an interesting pair, as men or women.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
One of my favorite films,"In the last year some film experts found the most famous film line. It was from the James Bond movies. But I think there is a film line which is much more famous. This is called ""Nobody's perfect"". The film line is on the end of the best US comedy ever made. Jack Lemmon would have deserved an Oscar but unfortunately the people from the Academy don't like man in drag and so it is not a wonder that men who plays women's roles never get an Academy Award (like Craig Russell, Robin Williams, Dustin Hoffman or Jaye Davidson)",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A Classic Comedy With One Huge Error,"There's no doubt that this film is one of the all-time classic comedies. However, the producers made one unforgivable and blatant error in making this movie: It was not filmed in color! How can you make a movie even in 1959, at the beautiful and historic Hotel Del Coronado with its classic white exterior and trademark red roof next to the blue Pacific, then have the short-sighted stupidity to film it in black and white? Not to mention the added color of the beach and yachts. What were they thinking? Filming in color would have added extra depth, dimension, and visual charm to this classic. A blatant and idiotic error in an otherwise perfect comedy movie.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Good not great.,"Highly acclaimed as one of the best comedies in Hollywood history, Some Like It Hot has a neat comedic approach that was sure a topic on every gossiper's agenda in the late '50s. It's a funny little movie with an original storyline. Some Like It Hot utilizes it's beautiful costumes to their full potential, it's a beautiful film to look at it. The three stars are all very serviceable in their roles. Jack Lemon is the stand out owning the character and never looking back. Marilyn Monroe is deliciously sweet in the centerpiece of the film of beauty and sexuality. This is widely considered to be her career best, its a shame she missed an Oscar nomination for it. Tony Curtis does a fine job as well. My favorite scene is the legendary ""I Wanna Be Loved By You"" song lives up to the hype, it's a wonderful scene. My problem with Some Like It Hot is the lack of emotional investment I felt for the story or the characters. I didn't quite get the smacking wave of brilliance others have lived with Some Like It Hot. It's still a good movie, but I didn't think it was a great one.Rating: 7/10Grade: B",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Is it hot?,"Some like it hot is a lesson in it's self. The title doesn't really fit the lesson but it draws the audience's attention to the movie.

During this time period in the movie the alcohol prohibition but there is still a lot of the drinking, and we all know what happens especially two of them are men.

This is hot!!!!!!!,"Some Like it Hot is an all time classic movie that will go down in history and deservedly so as one of the funniest comedies of all time. It begins a little slow with us being introduced to the characters Joe and Jerry working in a mortuary and witnessing the St Valentines day Massacre whilst trying to pick up a car. Despite its slow beginning it picks up from the point where the two agree to disguise themselves as women to join an all female band on their way to Florida. From then on in it is one of the best movies I have seen to date. However with one element of confusion Jerry played by Jack Lemmon appears to be the one interested in Marilyn Monroes ditzy sugar Cane with Joe telling him to keep clear, however as soon as they arrive at the holidaying destination Jerry appears to have lost his infatuation passing it to Joe who then carries on to seduce her. Despite this I find this fil very enjoyable and watch it on a regular basis. Osgood Fielding the third is the show stealer of this movie as you have to laugh at his absolute stupidity at falling for a man with the high light being the last line. I hope it goes down in history as being the last line ever. The reviewer gives this movie ten out of ten as it is harmless fun I could watch again and again.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A much over-rated film!,"I am sorry but I simply cannot join in the acclaim that this film has been accorded. It's by no means a bad film, but there are those who have pronounced it as the funniest film ever made, which I find quite ridiculous in the face of films like 'The Ladykillers' (Alec Guiness version of course). This film relies on it's comedy from one of the oldest gags in the book, namely two blokes dressing up as women. Granted they do a good job of it, but there is nothing original here. Marilyn Monroe is a pain, and Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis have had better starring roles. I have persevered over a period of time trying to like this film, but in the end I had to be true to myself so I passed my video on to someone else who would far better appreciate it.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

I liked it...hot.,"After the American Film Institue put out their list of the 100 greatest films of all time, I made a personal goal to sit down and watch all of them. Progress has been steady, and I'm really trying to watch everything in the top 20 at least.  Well, after seeing a biography on Jack Lemmon on tv last week, I had an urge to watch #14, ""Some Like It Hot"".  So I rented it, and finally understood what the big deal was.  This movie is truly a Hollywood gem to treasure for years to come.  Tony Curtis was great, but it was Jack Lemmon who really stood out from the rest. The film follows Jerry and Joe, a couple of out-of-work big band players (Jerry plays the bass and Joe plays the sax), scraping together enough money to live from one crummy gig to the next.  Soon they here about two unexpected absences from an all-girl band that was travelling to Florida to perform at the Ritz.  Conveniently, the two girls missing were the bass and sax players (hey, it's the movies).  Reluctant at first, the boys were finally persuaded after an accidental run-in with the Chicago mob.  So they hiked up their ""high-heels"" and got on that bus as 'Geraldine' and 'Josephine', instead of Jerry and Joe. As usual, mishaps and jealousy of a girl (Marylin Monroe) take place, and it unfolds into one of the most witty movies of the time.  Go out and rent this flick.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
