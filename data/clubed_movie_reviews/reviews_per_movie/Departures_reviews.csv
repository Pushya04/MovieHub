One of my all-time favorite movies,"It had been years ago since a movie moved me so much that it had brought tears to my eyes, but I couldn't keep my eyes dry while experiencing Okuribito. The story, acting, music and photography are all very impressive.I guess everyone can in some way relate to the emotions that are conveyed in Okuribito. In my humble opinion this movie is a classic in the likes of Akira Kurosawa's and Yasujiro Ozu's best work: subtle, elegant, serene, soulful, touching and timelessly beautiful. This kind of cinematic storytelling stands high above the usual formula-driven, soulless, commercial Hollywood crap.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
the rituals that sustain us,"Almost three decades since starring in Juzo Itami's classic The Funeral, Tsutomu Yamazaki once more shines in a tale woven around the rituals, traditions and theatre involved in Japanese death rites. The irreverence that makes Itami's classic such a delight is present here. Daigo's first day on the job playing a stiff in a DVD for the funeral business comes back to haunt him in hilarious fashion later on. However, there is also reverence, the film respectfully pointing out that the people who do this necessary but thankless task do not deserve the disdain and revulsion that their profession often attracts.Daigo loses his job as a cellist, returns to his inaka roots and stumbles into a job as an undertaker. Too ashamed to tell his wife, he slowly warms to his apprenticeship under the masterful tutelage of Sasaki. As he goes about his business, the inevitable traumas of a childhood long forgotten bubble to the surface as he goes about re-acquainting himself with the town. The conduit for the negative feelings towards his profession is Daigo's wife Mika, who takes punitive steps on discovering his new employment.Screenwriter Kundo Koyama has to take credit for a script that moves along briskly, juxtaposing black farce with raw tenderness, all done seamlessly, and acutely observed. Lipstick on a corpse produces gales of laughter, and you are reminded that sometimes the best fun is had at funerals. Daigo moves towards a form of reconciliation and redemption through the promptings of those around him, and the comfort of his cello.It would be all too easy for material like this to lurch into sappy sentimentality, but the film tugs at the heartstrings without overtly manipulating its audience. Motoki has to take some plaudits for this for a performance that amuses at times but hints at deep inner turmoil at others. Hirosue is less consistent, at times indulging in the head-bobbing, giggly, saccharine sweet girlishness that is the forte of the Japanese TV drama actress. She has one line in the climactic scene of such stunning obviousness I am surprised it stayed in, but for the most part she redeems herself in the tense interactions with Motoki over their differing views on his new career. Overall, she convinces as the supportive but put-upon wife.From Kurosawa's Ikiru through The Funeral and now Okuribito, Japanese cinema has a rich vein of movies that exploit the rituals of death. How those rituals comfort us, enchant us, and see us through to a place where the pain still exists but might come to an end, is laid bare in Okuribito. It is an absorbing, moving tale, full of laughter and tears, that celebrates the intricate details of a Japanese rites of passage while laying bare their universal function. Best seen in the cinema, to get the full effect of the luscious orchestral score.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Beautiful Movie- I disagree with reviews,"I have read many reviews on this movie and have been surprised by what I saw. I saw many reviews with comments such as this didn't deserve its Oscar win and that this movie was far from a masterpiece because it was too sentimental and exaggerated.One person proposed showing less scenes of him with the cello, speeding up the movie, and cutting out scenes with long stares. I disagree and believe that this movie is beautiful the way it is. This movie is not overbrimming with sentimentality; it has a good amount for such an emotional film. The scenes with the cello and the birds represent the passion and emotions he feel. We don't call Shakespeare's long poems sentimental so why do we call this work of Japanese art that? The more I heard the music I felt like the more I understood the movie. Western movies sometimes disregard time in movies allowing action to follow action. This movie was simply about the meaning of living knowing that we would die. The long, drawn out silences were necessary to convey emotions. If you have studied many Asian cultures, you know that they convey emotions not through words but through silence. The silences give us time to ponder and think about the questions raised, something we are often not given in bang bang action American films.As a musician, I feel like this whole movie is like song filled with much raw emotion.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
The odd job,"""Okuribito"", literally ""The person who sees off"", is about a supposedly untalented cellist's new job. After returning to hometown as a failure in the music world, he applies for a job with vague description. It turns out to be a job posting for ""encoffiner"", a person who performs rites and rituals before placing the body into the coffin. A 'tainted' job in the eyes of the society, but he eventually develops pride and purpose in this profession.The movie started with subtle humor that had me chuckling for first hour, but I was slowly drawn into the story. It turned out to be a very touching and deep film.The acting in this film was superb. Motoki Tomohiro's performance was especially amazing, hilarious at times, and played the serious and professional scenes very convincingly. I also really liked his narration, which really sets the mood and tone of the following scenes. Yamazaki Tsutomu was also excellent as the protagonist's cool mentor. The film had incredibly nice flow and very well-directed. Music in this movie played a huge role, expressing the protagonist's feelings and harmonized with every scene. It was simply beautiful.This movie gave me a glimpse of the profession of ""encoffiner"", as a very respectable job, as it requires absolute accuracy, professionalism, and the respect for the dead even though it is looked down by the society. It is the encoffiner who sees off a person's last journey after dressing them up. This movie successfully depicts the pride in one's job, and questions the meaning of death.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A very powerful film,"This film is about an unemployed man taking up a job as a person who prepares body before putting into the coffin.""Departures"" is a beautiful film. It is about the last journey before a person is reduced to ashes, yet it never feels gloomy. In fact, it shows that all humans die one day, and it is how we view it and how those left behind cope with death that matters. Kobayashi treats the bodies with such enormous respect and dignity, which touches me a lot. ""Departures"" is a film to feel. It makes you think and feel about such a taboo topic which is not normally discussed. I commend the filmmakers for making ""Departures"". It's a must see.",,Anonymous,Music
A Nutshell Review: Departures,"By now almost everyone would have heard of this Japanese film Okuribito (Departures), given its win in the recent Academy Awards, clinching the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, beating the likes of crowd favourite Waltzing With Bashir, and the Palme D'or winner The Class. And now after watching it, it's no surprise really, because if I were to go tongue in cheek, it's the novelty factor, given that the Academy would never have conceived upon the notion that a film coming from Asia and filled with death, corpses and coffins, would be anything but a horror film. Seriously though, Departures have Awards written all over it, with fine acting complementing a strong story to tell.I suppose the equivalent of a ""casketer"" in local context, would be the embalmer. And it's without a doubt a profession most misunderstood, and shunned because of our innate fear of death. We choose to avoid death where it had gone, and being an embalmer would unlikely be on any kid's wish list of professions. Despite the stereotypical negative connotations, it is a profession that is quite dignified, because the professional is entrusted with the responsibility of helping the loved ones of the deceased cope with the passing on, and to help ease the pain in bringing some colour before the final journey to either the burial ground, or crematorium.Departures demystifies this profession in the Japanese context. And like all things Japanese, the process comes with an elaborate ritual of preparation, cleansing and presentation, all done with great precision, skillful grace and utmost respect for both the deceased, and the family members. The profession depicted here in the film, is one of the highest order, where we see exactly how the casketers go about their job, and the separation of duties with the undertaker.Masahiro Motoki (last seen in The Longest Night in Shanghai) stars as the lead protagonist Daigo Kobayashi, a cellist in an orchestra who dreams of going places around the world with his wife Mika (Ryoko Hirosue) in tow. Unfortunately for him, his orchestra folds and he is forced to sell his expensive white elephant since he doubts he could make his passion into a successful career. Dejected, he convinces his wife to retreat back into the small town he came from, living in the house his late mother had left behind, in order to start a new life. Little did he know when responding to a job classifieds that a typo had given him the impression he would be in a career that involves travel. The boss of the shop Ikuei Sasaki (Tsutomu Yamazaki) hires him on instinct, and as the saying goes, the rest is history.For the curious, the film is an excellent medium to showcase the profession and to do so in good light. We come to learn the craft behind the job, and the necessity of it all, be it dealing with grieving family members, or taking care of bodies that are bound for autopsies. Departures paints through Daigo's experience, the varying spectrum of emotions that one as a service provider would have to face, as we journey with him from novice level. All's not doom and gloom of course, as director Yujiro Takita paced the film with well meaning humour  again never slapstick or disrespectful  throughout the narrative.The story by Kundo Koyama also excellently portrayed Daigo's relationships with his wife and with his mentor, where the former was like a rubber band waiting to snap because of Daigo's deliberate attempts to not tell his lovely wife what he's up to for a career in order to shield her from the taboo. With the latter from whom he picks up the tools of the trade from, there's a surrogate father figure which he never had while growing up, resulting in some pent up hatred toward his dad who walked out on the family when he was young.It's an extremely moving piece of drama that doesn't get bogged down by melodrama, and I thoroughly enjoyed its themes of reconciliation, forgiveness and best of all, being a professional and serving with pride. It's a fantastically crafted film with an excellent cast all round, and shatters all taboos that come with the profession of a ""casketer"". I know it's cliché to say this, but Departures will be a strong contender when I compile my list of top films for the year. It's been some time already where I'm equally entertained and moved by a film, and without a doubt, do not let this depart from our local cinemas before you get a chance to watch it on the big screen. Highly recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Marvellous!!! One of the best movies I've ever seen!!!,"Probably the best movie I've ever seen. I have seen it at the 32nd Montreal World Film Festival and I hope it'll be well awarded! Even though the plot line is the ""death"", it's done with such kindness, softness and emotion (every little thing in the Japanese culture is made like a piece of art) and being able to make us feel so much emotions concerning the subject was really enjoyable. It's really a must see, the music is so captivating in every moment of grief. I had to hold my tears 5 times at least. I was also glad to see Tsutomu Yamazaki, I hadn't saw him since Tampopo... that was years ago (there are not a lot of Japanese movies to see in french theaters.)",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Mediocre,"Last year's Best Foreign Film winner at the Academy Awards. It's exactly the kind of film they like: sweet, simple and uninspired. Seriously, Japan can do so much better than this. Masahiro Motoki (great in Tsukamoto's Gemini and Miike's The Bird People in China) stars as an out-of-work cellist who takes a job at a funeral home. Those who prepare the dead in Japan have historically been met with great prejudices. People just don't trust people in Japan who touch the dead and make their living off of misery. So Motoki fights prejudice, even loses his wife (the adorable Ryoko Hirosue) for a while. Eventually, he discovers that the service he is providing is valuable and helps people. The film isn't bad, really. It's just nothing special and occasionally schmaltzy. The only thing I really liked was Jo Hisaishi's musical score. There's one piece during a montage that's especially killer.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Anyone else think this was terrible?,"I read through most of the external reviews I usually read - Ebert, The Village Voice etc., and looked through the user's comments... It seems everybody has been swept away by this tidal wave of schmaltz! I'm hoping it's simply that those who feel like me just haven't bothered to write. (Ebert has long become sentimental with age...) Isn't this film SO affected, so infantile in its sentimentality? Yes it has a core of beauty, and the potential for being a superb, emotionally devastating film. But it isn't. It's a waste of its material. The one positive element was the ceremony, which at certain moments in the film was protected by a tone of solemnity from the lavish, exaggerated, coarse emotional manipulation on a level with the sappiest soap opera. Another perhaps was the undertaker boss. How very sad. I wish a good director would do a remake and turn it into the polished gem it could have been.

"Remarkable Movie, Deserved the Oscar","Many things can be told about this movie;How it remarkably handle the ""Dead"" issue, Meaning of life, family relations etc... But What I've mostly grasped from the movie is (I also witnessed that during my 6 months of stay in Japan) that the way the Japanese people do their job. Absolutely devoted, in perfect patience and discipline. No matter What they are doing and What the salary is... They could be a Waitress,a Garbage man or as in the movie; an encoffiner. They just concentrate and do their job. So if you got bored from your job, I simply recommend you watch this movie and compare yourself with the Guy in the Lead role.And think again.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Death is not the end,"Fixating itself on the pretext of death as a strong stigma to the Japanese rather than on the necrophiliac titillation possessed by those outside this particular societal circle, ""Departures"" approaches this issue with credible poignancy made more relevant when seen as a mitigation by director Yojiro Takita and screenwriter Kundo Koyama to a prevailing Eastern taboo. Although slightly undercut by an ultimately predictable script, Japan's Oscar-winning entry for this year's foreign-language film category is thoughtfully expressive, portraying a morbidly incriminating profession with dignified grace.Daigo (Masahiro Motoki) is a cellist for a symphony orchestra which disbands after a performance for failing to gather audiences. Having no job, he and his wife Mika (Ryoko Hirosue) move to his hometown in his deceased mother's house where, upon answering a help-wanted ad he mistakes for a travel agency, he ends up as ""encoffiner""-in-training, helping his boss Sasaki (Tsutomu Yamazaki) perform a set of ceremonial rites for the dead before cremation. Aware of the social demonizing of such job, he lies to his wife about it until she learns of it anyway and pleads that he finds a ""normal job,"" an appeal he finds tough when he increasingly develops a meticulous fondness for his work.Takita's charming and ultimately touching apologetic on mortality charts the disorderliness arising from an individual's social circle while he pursues his sense of purpose, with the titular itinerary suggesting more than the moribund ritual the film's protagonist is subjected to. Thus, it also becomes a plaintive meditation on Daigo's spiritual and moral development as he attends to the various abandonment issues that haunt him (a father who ran off when he was young and a wife that stigmatizes him for his newly found ""filthy"" career). Ultimately, ""Departures"" is as much a story of atonement as it is about dealing with mortality; that in order to fully embrace one's existence, it is necessary to cope with death -- both literally and figuratively -- while nurturing the bonds that exist among those who still live.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Best Japanese film in 2008!,"Beautiful and touching movie about life and death. My favorite movies dealing with the same issue are Akira Kurosawa's ""Ikiru"" and ""Red Beard"". Also, Juzo Itami's comedy ""Funeral"" is pretty good one. Same as these master's works, Director Takita successfully put good comedy elements in this serious film. The idea ""Death is a gate for another world"" may be based on Buddhism belief, but I am sure you can relate yourself to this story with your own experience of losing somebody important. Masahiro Motoki was at his best for the leading role. He once played similar role in ""Sumo Do, Sumo Don't"" by Director Masayuki Suo (Shall We Dansu?) in terms of being put in awkward situation, involved seriously and end up finding the virtue in it. Music score is by Joe Hisaishi. Great as always. He has done great jobs on films for Takeshi Kitano and Hayao Miyazaki. I am sure this will be the best Japanese movie in 2008. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Lyrical Film About Finding Passion in an Unlikely Profession,"Without irony, there is a funereal grace to this 2009 dramedy, so much so that one can sometimes hear the distinct echoes of film master Yasujiro Ozu (""Tokyo Story"") in director Yojiro Takita's subtle yet stately look at the business of preparing deceased bodies for their caskets. Ozu's influence can be felt most in the quietude of tone that reveals the inevitability of death with both grim humor and spiritual awakening. The film's lyricism rests on the mournful cello accompaniment of the protagonist, Daigo Kobayashi, a young cellist who finds himself jobless after his Tokyo-based orchestra is disbanded. Out of economic necessity, he and his sunny, supportive wife Mika move back to his late mother's house up north in Yamagata.As outlined in Kundo Koyama's somewhat methodical screenplay, the story focuses on the challenge Daigo faces in finding one's place in life, no matter how dubious it may seem to others. Daigo, bereft of his passion, answers a job ad involving ""departures"", which leads him to believe the company is a travel agency. However, he quickly realizes the two-person operation is actually about preparing bodies for burial, ritually cleansing and cloaking them while the mourners watch. Initially aghast, he is convinced by the taciturn owner Mr. Sasaki that he is ideal for the role of assistant and offers him the job. He has to fight his own prejudices as well as others about the supposed unseemliness of his profession, including Mika, who finds out her husband's new profession and pronounces him unclean. Daigo, however, realizes he has found his passion in the pre-burial ceremony, and Sasaki teaches him the ropes in a way that recalls Juzo Itami's beloved 1985 comedy, ""Tampopo"".Former boy-band singer Masahiro Motoki is genuinely affecting as Daigo, while Ryoko Hirosue brings a surprising layer of complexity to the perennially sunny Mika. The deadpan Tsutomu Yamazaki makes Sasaki the film's key gravitational element with a minimum of effort, while Kimiko Yo shows an offbeat quality as his office manager Yuriko. The cinematography by Takeshi Hamada is top-notch with some memorable images offered along the way (like Daigo playing his cello on a hilltop), and Joe Hisaishi's (""Kikujiro"") music score allows dramatic sweep without getting too epic. On the downside, the film runs too long at 130 minutes, and there are moments when the comedy is played too broadly and the sentiment laid on too thick. Still, the movie shows Japanese cinema still exudes a unique identity, and there is global vitality still in that country's film industry. A brief interview with Takita is the major bonus on the 2010 DVD.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A Beautiful and Full of Sentiments Story about Life and Death,"In Tokyo, the violoncellist Daigo Kobayashi (Masahiro Motoki) loses his job when the sponsor dissolves his orchestra. Deigo decides to return to his hometown Yamagata with his wife Mika (Ryoko Hirosue) to live in the house that his mother, who has just passed away, left for him. While seeking a job in the newspaper, he finds an advertisement entitled Departures in the NK Agency and he schedules an interview believing it is a travel agency. However, he finds out that the position is to work in a funeral business as a sort of undertaker that prepares the corpse for cremation and the afterlife. While Mika and his friends look down on his job, Daigo feels proud with the recognition of the families of the diseased persons with his work. When the owner of the bathhouse Tsurunoyu dies, Mika finally recognizes the beauty of the artistic work of Daigo. When they are informed that his absent father has died alone in a fishing village, Daigo resolves his innermost issues with him.The winner of Best Foreign Language Film of 2009 ""Okuribito"" is a touching movie with a beautiful and full of sentiments story about life and death. The idea of death as a gateway to the afterlife has been explored in many movies; but in ""Okuribito"" it is disclosed in an artistic and beautifully sad way, through a dramatic and respectful but never corny relationship with the families of the diseased person. This wonderful movie was awarded with thirty-one (31) wins and three (3) nominations to several film festivals, and is supported by an original screenplay based on the rich Japanese culture that brings the most different and antagonistic feelings to the viewer; magnificent direction and performances of the lead and support cast; fantastic cinematography, lighting and art direction; and a stunning and stylish music score.

It's a funeral home, and he tries to hide it from his wife.It's a charming funny little Japanese movie. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year. The Japanese funeral ceremony is very fascinating, and it's a great look at a different culture. These are nice lovely characters. I find them very human. The comedy is very light. The drama is very touching. It is a little slow at over 2 hours, but the slow pace does fit the subject matter.

A snob review. bread and water.,"As I found out that this movie had been selected, among plenty of great Japanese movies, to win an academy award two things happened. 1. I couldn't stop watching this movie through what Americans may have felt. 2. A feeling of injustice build up since this movie had unreasonably been forwarded among so many great movies. I can even name-drop TV-series that are better.A lot of people on here seems to know very little about Japan or Japanese movies (which is fine, that's not the problem). But how can the masses who have little cultural/cinematic experience set the norm? I've never been such a snob before but the reactions to the movie are so off-target. Questions on here as - Who is the Japanese Spielberg? - are an insult to Japanese movies as well as all American movies. I think most people on here like the movie because it is Japanese and they explain all the flaws with the same reasoning, because it is Japanese. Look at the job interview. It is trying to be funny but isn't. If it is trying to be realistic it is far from it. The adjective we have left, if not realistic or funny, is artificial. But I have to applaud how open-minded people have received the movie, people have really tried to understand the Japenese culture. But my review is rather a written notice on unjust because of the exaggeration: the voting, the words. It hurts to know that great movies are ignored.The plot is very weak. He could find another job, so why does he act so disgusted by it. The plot is actually: a man not telling his wife what job he has. If he just told her, there wouldn't be a plot and that would be much better. Another one was the non-existing problem that in the movie it was considered a terrible job to do, catering the dead. This movie didn't need conflicts but there were many banal conflicts which were projected and an hour and a half long drag.I wouldn't call the acting very bad but there were some catastrophically terrible reactions in there. When he finds out that the band has disbanded. Or what about the shaving accident. The whole sentō conversation scene was ridiculing people. Nobody thought that him taking the clothes off his wife was a very unusual reaction on his part and even stranger counter-reaction from Mika?People are praising the music score. There is nothing special or good about it. There are greater compositions but people aren't even used to classical music in movies, which tells us what kind of audience likes this movie. Most movies have a better score.The wife, as always in Japan with children and females, was laughing and energetic even at the worst places. It is sad that women and children are degraded to this manner and luckily it isn't as much the case in Japan as it is in Japanese movies.Cinematography is very plain. I don't want to go into this, but this is like watching a Hollywood movie taking place Japan.This movie is like bread and water, a delicious meal, especially for the hungry. But knowing that there are all kinds of flavors out there ruins the movie. All in all a very plain movie.Post Scriptum: In the end my review will be voted as not useful which proves that mindless indulgence is in favor to listening to a person's commentary and try to explore and expand. People just want to see 10/10 reviews, they don't care about substance.Other nominees for the award were to better movies: Entre les murs and waltz with Bashir. Both those movies are a lot stronger than Departures. It's a shame that when the academy finally caught a Japanese movie they caught the wrong one and too late.It makes me happy to know that Yôjirô Takita other productions (as expected nothing worth notice) include: molester train man and serial rape-murderer.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Departures is a touching ode to those who have left us.,"The surprise winner of the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film of 2008, Departures snatched home the golden man from favorites like Laurent Cantet's The Class, and Ari Folman's Waltz With Bashir. Directed by Yojiro Takita, the Japanese drama is in every way a deserving winner of the Oscar.And I hope that with this win, more will realize that Japanese cinema is not all populist crap; it can be culturally rich and deeply intense too. Correct me if I am wrong, but this is the second Oscar win (in this century) for a Japanese film since Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away (2001).Departures tells a story of a young married man, Daigo, who loses his job as a cellist in an orchestra which is seeing dwindling audiences. He then chances upon a job advertisement and lands himself (unwillingly) as an assistant to an old, experienced professional who plies his trade in the coffin business.While Daigo is understandably immensely uncomfortable with his work initially, the job grows on him as he consistently brings in the dough. He does ritual cleansing, dressing, and make-up for the dead during the funeral before they are put to rest in the coffin, or in short, encoffinment. Because of the nature of the job, Daigo's marriage falls apart and he feels unaccepted by society.But that is just the surface of the story. Departures dwells into something more intrinsic to our hearts -loss, death, guilt, regret, family, and love - emotions and themes that are omnipresent in our lives, but are often difficult to convey in film.Takita's picture reveals these with careful direction, honest acting, and a surreal music accompaniment (by the legendary Joe Hisaishi) to the film's many heart-wrenching moments. The characters are so well-realized that they take a life of their own; it is as if we know their entire life story, their painful past, and their hopes for the future.Not only does Departures tug at our heartstrings, it is also an eye-opening observation of a job most will shun without hesitation. Is it a loser's job? Is it an unclean job? What the director does well is to convince viewers that it is neither. Through sprinkles of effective humor, Takita manages to bring a light-hearted warmness to the film, though this is ultimately overwhelmed by the sheer melancholia of it all.Departures is a touching ode to those who have left us. It is also one of the best films to grace the screen in recent years. It is a powerful tearjerker and a reminder that embracing death can be a very beautiful thing too.

An oddly beautiful film about death....,"I doubt that ""Departures"" would appeal to a mass audience. That's because while it is a beautiful and artistic film, it's also about death--a topic most folks are very hesitant to think about...let alone go to a theater to see. But, I strongly advise you to stick with the film--it's well worth seeing and I can see why this film received the 2009 Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film.Daigo is a nice man. But, the orchestra in which he plays has been disbanded and he needs a job. He answers an ad in the newspaper for a job he THINKS has to do with a travel agency--not realizing that the job entails doing funeral rituals. Now this part of the film requires a bit of explaining, as such jobs are completely unknown in the USA. Instead of the mortician just picking up a dead body for burial (or cremation in most cases, as that is the Shinto tradition), there are people whose job it is to ritually prepare the corpse in front of the family--a strange way to handle a wake by Western standards. Now I am NOT being critical of this service--in the film, it had an odd sort of beauty and artistry about it. It's just very different from how death is handled in this and western countries. To understand exactly what I mean and what this process is, the film shows several such preparations by Daigo and his very likable boss. What happens next? See it for yourself.Now HOW can this turn into a good film? Well, the movie found a way to balance all this--with respect for the dead, not making the film too graphic and maintaining a healthy respect for the characters. And, the final thing is the most important--as you really like and respect the characters. And, the film is chock full of wonderful supporting characters. Overall, it's a very sweet and gentle film--one you really have to make yourself watch. After all, death is just a natural part of life--and the film handles the topic wonderfully.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Far from a Departure in form from in a recent canon of decent Japanese films, this film's exploring of a man in a niche career makes for impressive viewing.","For a film so wholly indebted to death and the deceased, beginning with its title that alludes to such things and carrying on in the nature of what it is the lead eventually comes to do, it is quite remarkable just how celebratory of living Yôjirô Takita's Departures really is; a piece using these means and specific content more inclined towards those whom have passed as items for breathing life into a person's existence. Departures will eventually tell the story of a Japanese man seemingly approaching his middle age, as well as the apparent crisis on its way as a result of getting there, whom comes to find something totally out of the ordinary, and in a totally unexpected manner, which goes on to shift thinking's and attitudes for both himself and those around him, in what is a quite often fabulously played drama displaying a good eye for black comedy and rich character study.Told in flashback, something I began as thinking was quite needless but brings certain resonances that creep up on you, the film documents a certain Daigo (Motoki); a Japanese man, of whom we sense is on the cusp of something big in his life, what with his partner; passions and skills he has in certain fields, but cannot quite pin down what. He is initially a cellist and a good cellist, but a redundant cellist after the principal of his orchestra announces, following a playing to a near empty auditorium we barely notice out of the fact the principal's pained expression dominates the screen, that the disbanding of the group is imminent. The following few sequences do very little to incline us into siding with Daigo; he slumps down at home in his charming Tokyo apartment and ponders, with his sizable instrument, just what it is he's going to do. His wife is the prim; softly spoken and rather sweet Mika (Hirosue), and she brings octopus back for dinner and tells him to cheer up 'cause he's still got her and her job brings in money and this nice apartment is still here and we all get to have exquisite seafood for dinner.Decisions are made and the pair of them move to Daigo's hometown of childhood a fair distance away, in the more remoter regions of Japan; once there, the gunning for a job whose interview and house of operations is barely distinguishable from any other place of business, bar a couple of rather large caskets propped up against the side of the wall, plays out into the coming into contact with something thoroughly out of the ordinary. This new job is what appears to be a cross contamination between that of an undertaker and a maid; a job without, I don't think, a name in the English language – a job whose role it is to undergo a ritualistic process of smartly preparing a dead body, in-front of their family and loved ones, before placing them in their coffins for later funerals: it is a job that few desire and even fewer, it seems, look upon with anything more than mere scorn.Early on, we feel this job exists merely to serve a purpose; that being, to pay the debts owed for the cost of his cello, a sum that, once eviscerated, will be able to see Daigo leave his post and start afresh with something else. This isn't necessarily the way, the film going on to document Daigo's exposure to such a career and his gradual coming to enjoy what it is he does in a refreshing fashion. When we first come to observe him in his new work surroundings, his employer Sasaki (Yamazaki) and the company's secretary appear odd or strange, even eccentric and whose socialism we don't wish to share. As expected, Daigo finds himself in the deep end early on, acting as an extra in a 'how-to' DVD giving way to his first call out with Sasaki seeing them deal with a body, whom has remained undiscovered for a fair while, acting as the inception into this chosen career. Daigo heads in, combating the sight of a dead body experienced for the first time as well as the terrible smell creating a putrid and somewhat unpleasant first exposure to things – all of it done and dealt with in a messy and comedic although significant manner.Running parallel to the audience's own response to the material, in that at the beginning the majority of us feel alienated; perturbed and perhaps a little grossed out, Daigo's coming to enjoy what it is the film is about stands side by side to that of Mika's discovery; staunch rejection and then consequent realisation that the nature of the man's work is actually both rather brave; invigorating to watch and quietly fascinating without necessarily being morbidly so. Daigo's boss and his co-workers appear to become more normalised without ever actually changing their general characteristics, in what is a gleefully subtle addition to proceedings as mindsets change and frameworks play out.Overlying everything is the fact that Daigo is a man whose prior exposure to death and the nature of grief has been largely negative thus far in his life; if not negative, then largely hollow, in that he missed his father's funeral on account of being oh, so very young and unable to attend for whatever reason, whereas the passing of his grandparents when he was still equally as young came and went without all those wondrous instances that time with grandparents can so often bring whilst a child. The error of Daigo's ways is in the dismissing of such things, the eventual job he acquires seeing him come to work with the deceased and, more important in this sense, those grieving before the understanding of the nature, or procession, of remembering one's dead that imbues this process is played out – the likes of which, with everything else, make for really involving viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Departures/Arrivals: 'The gift of last memories',"DEPARTURES (aka OKURIBITO) is an experience film, one of those graceful creations of cinema that finds the balance between comedy and drama, sensitive and sentimental, and is embellished by a wondrous musical score and glowing cinematography. Running time is in excess of two hours, but likely most viewers would elect to rewind and watch it again, so touching and vital is this story.Daigo Kobayashi (the enormously gifted Masahiro Motoki) was raised by his mother when his father for some reason left his family when Daigo was only six years old: his last memory of his father is a quiet scene by the ocean when the child and the father exchange found rocks. Daigo was encouraged by his parents to learn to play the cello so that he could amount to something special as a man. Things happen: Daigo goes off to study cello, his mother dies and he doesn't attend the funeral, he marries Mike (Ryoko Hirosue), and spends all their money on a prime cello to gain admission to the major orchestra in the city. The orchestra plays to near empty houses and is finally disbanded. Daigo is without an income, sells his prize cello, and with Mika's blessing, returns to his hometown to live in the home of his childhood. He answers an ad for work, an ad that uses the word 'Departures' making Daigo think this is a travel agency. When Daigo 'interviews' with the owner (Tsutomu Yamazaki) he discovers that the job in one called 'encoffinment' (a Japanese ceremonial procedure of preparing, dressing & praying for the corpse before putting them in the coffin). At first repulsed by the job, Daigo gradually discovers the importance of paying final respects to the dead and preparing them for the life ahead, and his experiences with the new found beauty of encoffinment ties in with memories of his family, recalls his estrangement from his father, and reunites him with old dear friends who run a bath house, etc. Mika is spared the truth about her husband's new job, and when she discovers the truth, Mika leaves Daigo who by now is enchanted with his position.Many experiences follow as Daigo encoffins all manner of people: there are some ugly scenes and some very humorous scenes depicting the variety of 'calls' Daigo gets. How the story winds down is not necessarily difficult to discern, but the manner in which the film ends is a work of great simplicity and beauty. Daigo's dealing with departures allows him to find his own arrivals.Writer Kundo Takita and director Yôjirô Takita well deserve all the awards lavished on this perfect little film. But much of the success of this story about another way to view death is the astonishingly multifaceted performance by Masahiro Motoki, a beautiful man and an equally beautiful actor. This is a film to watch repeatedly and definitely one to add to the personal library of DVDs.Grady Harp",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Just alright,"This was totally OK?Why the hell Netflix thought I would like it 5 stars worth is beyond me.About 30 minutes it dawned on me what it reminded me of - Sunshine Cleaners and one of any 100's of quirky, gentle mid-00's indie flicks about life upheavals.This was a thoroughly competent, Japanese version of one of those flicks.I kept expecting a big Gotcha! moment, the thing that would bring this to the top of the pile but it's not there.It is a thoroughly fine movie, that's it.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Do not depart from Departures,"I recollect at the Academy Awards last year when Japanese Director Yojiro Takita departed from his seat to accept the Best Foreign Language Picture Oscar. Many, yours truly included, were shocked that the frontrunner ""Waltz With Bashir"" was upset by this small independent Japanese flick. I guess that was the last waltz for Bashir, and the Academy was turning Japanese, I think they were turning Japanese, I really think so. After experiencing ""Departures"", I am glad the Academy veered that way. ""Departures"" is a moving, endearing, and even semi-comical film about a young Japanese cellist named Daigo Kobayashi who gets unemployed from his orchestra gig. Therefore, he moves to his Japanese hometown with his wife where he takes a job in a funeral home preparing the dead for their departures. At first, he thinks that the job is travel oriented. But upon arrival to his departures job interview, he realizes that he has to be ""prettying up the dead"" on a daily basis. However, ""Departures"" does not depart from the humanistic narrative themes on Daigo still dealing with the hurt on being deserted by his father as a child, and his resiliency to support his newlywed wife Ikue. Director Takita and Screenwriter Kundo Kayama resurrect what could have a lifeless Japanese story with poignant affirming themes on: life appreciation, spirituality of a departure, and misconceptions of the field of funeral services. Takita does incorporate profound symbolist themes on the film's narrative with the cello, food, and stones. Japanese movie star Masahiro Motoki was mas de un hero with his engaging performance as Daigo. Motoki carried the film quite brilliantly. But I cannot depart from this film review by also stating that I do take a bow on the supporting acting ensemble of ""Departures"", most notably: Tsutomu Yamakazi's performance as Daigo's funeral boss Ikuei Sasaki was of commanding variety, and Ryoko Hirosue work as Daigo's wife Ikue was more than Okaey. Takeshi Hamada's phenomenal scenic cinematography was also an asset to the film which I did not want my eyes to depart from. So arrive to a ""Departures"" viewing as soon as you can. **** Good",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A film of opposites,"For a film perpetually about death and funerals, Departures revels in showing its opposite. Every time it depicts a loss, it emphasises the newfound bonds that tie together the remaining family. Every time it depicts the rarity or stigmatised nature of the coffin procedure, it shows how necessary and dignified morticians are. The strongly deft and moving style of the film elevates the topic of death beyond the usual horror it evokes, and the subtle gratitudes shown by the family members go beyond the melodrama it might invite in a cinematic context. By showing this world through the eyes of insiders suddenly thrust into it, the processions of the funeral come to be identified with the music of the cello shown at the beginning. By discarding his musical career, the protagonist has simply moved onto another kind of orchestra, one that stirs the souls of the audience in a different way.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"caring for the death, caring for the living","The Japanese entry that received the Oscar for the best foreign movie deals with a theme that is not unique in the Japanese cinema - the death as a continuation of life, the caring and respect one owes to the dead which helps the living to continue with their own lives. It does it in a manner that is both emotional and serene, and the result is a film that will touch a cord for almost everybody who watches it.The hero is a musician, and this fact plays a role in the film, as it gives a pretext for wonderful music to be inserted and create the appropriate atmosphere or counterpoint in certain moments. He has to quit his profession when the orchestra he was playing in is disbanded and returns to his home city together with his beautiful and seemingly almost smiling wife. By accident - he is misreading a newspaper add - he is hired by an agency that cares for the bodies of the dead before cremation, a work so low class that he cannot even tell his wife about it. It's well paid however and he takes it, and then he is confronted with the reality of the 'departures' - his employer is an artist in the profession of making the final moments of quitting this world honorable for the dead, but especially kind and memorable for the remaining family. And we will all become convinced by the end of the film that this is how it should be.The film certainly belongs to the category of melodrama, but then it is good quality one. Most cinema viewers are not ashamed of dropping a tear when something moves them in the movie and appreciate directors, actors and story writers who are capable to induce such emotions. It tells also a lot to the non-Japanese viewers about conflicts between tradition and new pace of life, and about family relations and the role of the wife in the modern Japanese family. I am not familiar enough with the social and cultural details of Japan to make a judgment to what extent they are authentic, but they are clearly articulated and in a delicate manner. The film is maybe 10 or 20 minutes longer than it should be, but there are no long intervals when it becomes boring, so its length is supportable. It is wonderfully acted and viewers will probably remember for a long while the principal hero played by Masahiro Motoki, the older dead caretaker played by Tsutomu Yamazaki, and the wife Mika, played by the wonderful Ryoko Hirosue. Cinematography is simple and aesthetic, although the scenes of the hero playing music in the nature seem artificial and the filming of the mountain in the background is too many times repeated and apparently unjustified. Over all it is a good and moving film. Maybe it was not the best foreign film of the year, but it was quite a simple and obvious choice for the jury of the Academy.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
a very sad movie,"This is a very sad movie. Most of the movie involves a Japanese ceremony called coffining, publicly preparing the dead for burial. The lead actor Masahiro Motoki is handsome and boyish, and plays his role with comic ham exaggeration. It is not much about cellos.This is the first time I had any appreciation how ceremonies elegantly performed can help people over the trying humps in life.Part of the sadness comes from Daigo and his wife giving up grand dreams and settling for more ordinary ones.Part of it comes simply from realising everyone is gradually getting older and will inevitably die.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Heartfelt,"This is one of those films that just grows on you. It starts out as a study of a young Japanese family that is facing an uncertain future with optimism. When the young man answers an ad in the employment section of the local newspaper and sees the word Departures, he assumes the job to be with a travel agency. What he ends up doing is preparing the recently departed for a ceremonial cleansing in front of the families. Apparently, even though a significant part of the burial (actually cremation) process, these people are frowned upon by their peers. Even the resilient wife of the young man finds what he does repulsive and leaves him for a time. As with all great movies, this is about redemption and characterization and it allows us to follow the career of one who expresses great love and respect for the dead. I was stunned at the overall tenderness of this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Great Movie to watch,"The human dimension of this film touched me. Some of these things touched me to tears. I list a few of them.1. The job of the professionals who prepares the dead for their last contact with the family (wake) and their passage to eternity (cremation). In the film, the characters who perform this job, teach the spectator a true ritual of respect and affection with the dead. ""Respect and affection with the dead"": feelings that the modern life tries to banish from its practices. In the modern world, the dead are inconvenient and dispatched quickly in funerals where the majority of those who are present, entertain themselves with parallel talks, instead of focusing on the reason why they are there.2. The nobility and grandeur of this job that, in the film, is not associated with any religion, and is directly associated with dealing with human beings. This nobility and grandeur reflects also on to the dead, in the sense that it reminds us that the dead deserve our respect and affection, because a new stage of our relationship with them is starting.3.The way Daigo grows, as he learns this job, and overcomes (i)the social stigma that society imposes upon the contact with the dead and, also, the people who have contact with the dead, as well as (ii) his personal repulsion with repulsive material aspects of death (odors, rot, etc.)4. The way Daigo grows, as he incorporates the nobility and grandeur of the job he was forced to do because of the circumstances (he was jobless because the orchestra where he played cello was dismissed). And, when his wife discovers in what consists his job, and tries to force him to quit, he has grown so much that he chooses to keep the job instead to yield to his wife menaces.5. The way Daigo grows and which leads him back to play the cello and celebrate life more than ever, playing outdoors and playing at home as he used to do when he was a boy.6. The way Daigo wife grows when she has the opportunity to look close to the job of her husband, and begins to admire him and love him more. Wife who have the opportunity to convince Daigo to take care of his dead father, when Daigo runs away when he gets aware of his father death. Wife, who, when the opportunity showed up, says with pride to the individuals of the funeral, that were almost doing a dirty job with the deceased Daigo father, ""my husband will take care of him, he is a professional""7. The way Daigo grows when he encounter again the love for his father and forgive him for having abandoned the family, while he prepares his old man for the burial.8. How death can be seen as part of life process, when it causes some people to become aware of how much love they missed, and how much they have been loved without being aware of it.All this happens because Daigo goes back to his hometown, a small town. That is, the return to his origins helps to renew the ties with the traditions and helps the character to put himself together again.I'm omitting many precious details that appear throughout the film. These details must be seen personally, because the film was made with great sensitivity and expertise, and deserves to be seen.Roland.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Pretentious and Mediocre,"I own a big collection of japanese movies. In fact, i love Japanese Cinema. This is the first movie from Japan i could not finish. It is also the only movie from my collection that i put in the rubbish bin. When i took the trash out, i was relieved.
This movie is unnatural, engineered to be sentimental in a very cheap and predictable way, intellectually pretentious, as if it would carry a deep meaning ( it doesn't). It looks like a bunch of Japanese youngsters wanted to please an immature American audience.

"Good movie, better music, lousy audience","The bad first. I don't understand the Singaporean movie goers, are they all out to torture those who wants to enjoy the experience? Giggling girls, loud 40+ year old commentators, blinding active mobile screens, mobile ringing the ""Jive"" (3x), and people talking loudly outside the ""plex"" door. Are we still in the 70s? Can't be you all have got your cellphones. So please you paid for a ticket so did I and the rest of the audience. I would call these people inconsiderate, rude, insensitive and uncaring.The most memorable thing about the movie is no doubt the music. The pieces played are appropriately placed, soothing and calm with a touch of melancholy were needed. One of the best scores out of a movie, I reckon.The pace of the movie is kept fairly even throughout the film. However there is never a dull moment. The story is, in some places, mildly humorous but you'll not get anymore than a big grin out of it. You do have to remember you are watching a movie about a traditional Japanese funeral ritual. It underlines the taboo nature of the professional and how a rural community reacts to people like them.This movie gave me a how new respect to this traditions. I am not one who adhere to traditions and much less rituals.I will not dwell on the plots and story, so you can go into the cinema and enjoy this very well made movie.If you are those that can't turn off your precious cellphones, can't stop talking ""quietly"" while the film is running, and/or if you cannot appreciate another culture's ritual and tradition, please spare the people who can and not go and watch this.

The Sacred and the Profane,"There are few films that delve into the Japanese art of beautifying the dead. Nonetheless, Yōjirō Takita's 2008 film ""Departures (Okuribito)"", which took home the best Foreign Language prize at the 2009 Academy Awards, does exactly that.The film is loosely adapted from Aoki' Simmon's 2002 autobiography, ""Coffinman: the Journal of a Buddhist Mortician"". Hero Diago (played by former boy band heartthrob Masahiro Motoki) is a down-on-his- luck Tokyo cellist who loses his job when his orchestra disbands.He returns to his remote hometown with his meek, adoring wife Mika (Riyoki Hurosue) and takes residence in his late mother's house in an effort to reinvent himself. He discovers a newspaper advertisement for what he thinks is a travel agency helping out with ""departures"", only to learn that the position is for a firm that specializes in departures of a very different kind. A departure from which no traveler returns: death. This fosters his initiation into the subtle art of ""encoffinment"". The story that follows is a moving portrait of living with death as our protagonist must overcome his revulsion at his new line of work, while confronting some personal demons.The ensemble is appropriately dramatic. Particularly notable is the leading man as well as his mentor Mr. Sasaki (Tsutomu Yamazaki) who hires him and Yuriko Uemura (Kimiko Yo), a fellow employee at the funeral agency.""Departures"" follows in the path of other distinguished Japanese cinema such as Kurosawa's ""Ikiru"" and Juzo's ""The Funeral"". But while ""Ikuru"" and ""The Funeral"", focus more on the repercussions of death, ""Departures"" centers on the ceremony, the rituals of encoffinment and the passing into the afterlife. The film looks at abandonment, both in life and death as a cruel certainty. The film's greatest asset is its shimmering and poignant cinematography. A wind-tossed cherry blossom tree in such a film is inevitable, coming to life in spring to remind the Japanese that life is renewed after winter, only to die quickly after. In appreciating that transience, the Japanese seek to define themselves.By framing the harshness of death with the gentle treatment of the dead at the hands of Diago, the audience sees how the caring preparation of the body allows it to be softly ushered towards the final stop. This juxtaposition simultaneously confronts the taboo role of a figure who continually faces death, but creates an art form; one which is imbued with kindness and beauty.Aided by the use of classical music that decorates the soundtrack, Takita juxtaposes the sacred and the profane in a soft, pretty film lined with enough perversity to arrest the viewer. The film's alignment of the sublime and ridiculous is sparing, but enriches the tale.In 2009, this film beat out the critically acclaimed, ""Waltz with Bashir"" and ""The Class"", to win the Best Foreign Film prize at the Oscars. Beneath its pretty, emotional façade lie many layers that touch on the grizzly yet entirely normal nature of mortality. It's all there if you scratch beneath the surface.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Death is not the end,"Re-signifying the term, departure, Okuribito, provides us with a reflection on how we think about the losses we have throughout life, whether of people, dreams, objects, relationships, etc.We follow the story of Daigo, a cellist who has his first game in history, he has to leave his orchestra and consequently the dream of playing in an orchestra, soon after that, he has to let go of his cello. The film makes some allusions as at times wanting some dreams will not take us to a place of peace (fish scenes), perhaps the film has suffered some Buddhist influence. Furthermore, it is proposed that sometimes letting go of a dream opens up the possibility of finding our great talent.On the other hand, the film gives a new tone regarding the death of our loved ones, that is, dying is not the end, but the possibility of a new beginning, that we remember who left, not with sadness, but of the good times lived. In addition, it addresses prejudices, whether at work, gender, among other things. With very funny scenes.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

An Unforgettable Contemplation on Life and Death,"A Cello Player in a Tokyo orchestra loses his job after the Orchestra is disbanded. Together with his kind, gorgeous wife, they move to his hometown of YAMAGATA and start a new life in his late mother's house. He then chances to find a job in a company preparing dead people for cremation. The stigma of having a job in which he must touch dead people, soon gives way to people's respect for a profession that is as important and beautiful as life itself. The Japanese title of the movie - おくりびと (OKURIBITO) - literally means SENDING PEOPLE OFF and that's what the movie is about; But this beautifully written and exceptionally acted movie - which is ""perfect"" like anything else out of Japan - is an intense, philosophical contemplation on Life and ultimately rebirth through Death - which I have only seen in Abbas Kiarostami's ""THE TASTE OF CHERRY"" - and how people even in a traditional society like Japan sometimes fail to understand that we have been born to help each other make this world a better place and to love and forgive each other and respect our elders no matter how many mistakes they make; But this lesson is eloquently and modestly taught and learned. The heartbreaking denouement, where Daigo prepares his father's body for cremation and the cremation of the lady owner of the village Bathhouse are just two highlights in this gem of a movie which demands multiple viewings and deep reflection. The direction, screenplay, acting and cinematography are top-notch and the scenes with Fujisan in the background are strikingly shot and edited. Forgiveness is one of the greatest blessings ever granted to human beings and it's heartrendingly pictured in this deserved Oscar winner. Don't miss this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A special niche in the funeral professions,"This film revealed to me what I consider to be a very special niche in the funeral professions. I've long known of embalmers, funeral cosmetologists, hearsemen and funeral masters of ceremonies. But this is the first time, I have encountered ""encoffiners"" who perform the ritual of enconffinment.I was impressed by the precision and grace of the encoffiners portrayed in the film. They way the cleaned the bodies, their putting on and removal of blankets, shrouds and clothes without exposing any part of the deceased bodies other than their faces, hands and feet showed deep respect. Why do they take such trouble when the body is destined for cremation anyway? Why all the washing, dressing, shaving and make-up? Obviously, they believe in an after life for, after all, they kept using the phrase ""sending off"" in reference to what they do.Their measured and reverent movements evoked in me memories of a Tridentine mass performed by a truly devout priest.I realize that there are those who find this film boring, weird or allegedly inappropriately acted. As someone who worked closely with Japanese and traveled extensively in Japan, I hope to enlighten them on some aspects of Japanese culture through my anecdotes.On a visit to the ancient city of Kyoto, my boss proudly announced that he was taking me to a ""cha-no-yu,"" a tea ceremony. I wondered what the big deal was because at the time I would rather be attending a Chinese lauriat or even better, go to a karaoke bar in Tokyo's Ginza. Nevertheless, I was deeply moved by the ceremony. First, I was struck by the respect shown to me by the lady who performed the ceremony who practically kowtowed to me. Her actions in the preparation, serving and drinking of the tea reminded me of the mass, the transubstantiation of the wine into the blood of the Savior and communion.In two dinner visits to the houses of a Japanese executive and of a newsman, I found their hospitality rather formal but very satisfying as well. In both visits a female sat beside me to serve me. In the first instance, she was the matron of the house. In the second, it was a daughter. They way they presented and served food was almost ritualistic. In both cases, the ladies peeled oranges for me and the delightful surprise was not the taste of the oranges but they way they peeled them so that the peelings when laid on the table looked like flowers.One night in Kumamoto while I was sleeping, I was awakened by the lady of the house who told me that it was snowing and invited me to come out and watch with her. She led me to the living room where there was a large glass picture window. As we sat on our haunches on the floor and watched the snow cover the lawn and the trees, I realized that she considered that a treat and to me, it was.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
The camera lies,"Obviously this film is not the worst film ever. Camera work, actors, setting, even concept were all great. I could award it 5 stars out of 10 just to be fair. But in the days after watching it, the essential lie of the plot has been bugging me more and more, and I've started to outright detest it.All of the good elements of this film can be found in the book ""All Creatures Great and Small"" by James Herriot. The down-on-his-luck virtuoso who goes to the countryside, visits many different kinds of families, and has to work for a forgetful and self-contradictory old man who in the end teaches him a lot about life. It's all there, so neglect this movie if you can and give that a read instead.I know, what about the death part? Isn't that the real beauty of the movie? How death becomes an important moment of parting?No... it looks beautiful, but that's the lie of the film. Consider that this guy's job is literally putting lipstick on a corpse. Yes, that sounds unpoetic and insulting to the film, but that's not an exaggeration. That's literally what he does.All the bodies in this film appear to have keeled over and expired without injury. Real life corpses are not always so lucky. The suffering of death cannot always be whitewashed over like this. The traditional Buddhist meditation on death is on the destruction of the body, the disgusting things that happen when bodies decay. This film is doing something evil. It tells us to purchase a pound of make up and await the perfect funeral, when we can cry out our unresolved conflicts. Funerals are not meant to be perfect. Death in real life is not as convenient as it is to the plot of this film.The ancients had death all around them, from untreated disease or violence. It is we of the 21st century who have no understanding of what it means for a life to have an end. The film gives a little taste of that during funeral scenes, but in such a warped way. It dresses up and masks the end so we can imagine that all our bodies can be cleaned up and exhibited with such dignity. The friends and relatives of the character, who exhibit distress over his choice of work, are correctly showing the cultural reaction of a traditional society that understands that a dead body is something apart from society. The film has no patience or sympathy for this reaction. It is portrayed as stupid, ignorant bigotry.The reverse is true. We are the ones who are stupid and ignorant for inventing the false image of death portrayed in this film. The lie of the camera is so embedded into the fabric of this movie that I cannot justify giving it a good review.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

This film really deserved to win an Oscar, unlike many others.First of all the cinematography was beautiful: it was like watching an anime film by Studio Ghibli, every image looked like it could have been drawn, colour- and compositionwise.The characters were also well written: they were pleasant to follow and not over the top at all. Often, in arthousefilms, I feel like the characters are too emotional, to the point where it's unrealistic. Not in this film: the characters were calm, sensible people and it's not hard to relate to them.The story itself is what made this film stand out most of all: it was a perfect balance between comedy and tragedy. The comical moments put an actual smile on my face and didn't seem forced, as is often the case. But the comedy did not nullify the tragic moments. I wouldn't be surprised if most of the audience will be moved to tears more and more as the story progresses. It is, however, not the kind of tragedy that makes you feel empty and depressed afterwards: far from it actually, it makes you appreciate the small things in life more.In summary this is a brilliant movie with great characters and a story that is slow, but not once boring.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A different start...,"""Departures"" is a drama movie in which we watch a man who is a devoted cellist in an orchestra that has just been dissolved and now he is unemployed. After some time he decides to return to his hometown where he finds a new job which is really different than the previous one. His new job is to prepare the deceased bodies for burial and entry into the next life.I liked this movie because it was a different kind of movies than these that I used to watch so it was a new experience for me. That was something that I found really interesting. Another thing that I liked in this movie was the beautiful interpretation of Masahiro Motoki who played as Daigo Kobayashi and he was simply outstanding on it. Another interpretation that I liked was Tsutomu Yamazaki's who played as Ikuei Sasaki.Lastly I want to say that ""Departures"" is a really different movie than the movies that you are used to watch and this is something that makes this movie so special and unique. This movie will teach you the true meaning of life and how important and short is.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Modern Classic,"I absolutely loved this movie. The score, the acting, cinematography and story are so beautifully woven together. Maybe I'm biased because I can relate to the story but I could not hold back tears in multiple moments while watching this film. The way the music adds so much to each scene is unbelievable. It may be one of the greatest soundtracks I have ever heard. It's a shame that this was not nominated back then for best picture but now times are different and amazing films like this will not just be relegated to the foreign film category. (Not like the Oscar's should be the definition for success but the promotion that films get is incredible and it only leads to more films this being made since studios will spend their money on them). I would very much recommend to watch this movie, but it is a pretty sad film so be prepared!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
light hearted sentimental film,"A well written movie, which touches many themes most importantly dealing with death and watching others grief upon it. One side of it is very soft and touches our heart but on the other hand it is not as astonishing as we expect it to be. Story and even scenes are very predictable. Ending also could be seen from minutes away from it. Director has worked hard on the interior of Coffining but failed to bring deeper sentiments onto screen. Tsutomu Yamazaki's portrayal of a Boss who teaches the protagonist is the most fabulous quality of the movie. Actor actually work the role around and inside. Masahiro Motoki and Ryōko Hirosue are very convincing although camera sometime focused on Ryōko more then it needed. Her character as a devoted wife is well however it is not explored much. Ritual of coffining are filmed very good. The sub plot of protagonist's relation with his father was good but there could have been more about it.

Deep and meaningful movie,Watching the Japenese movie of Okiribito (Departures) will give you unforgettable acting from all the important characters while you will see a peaceful and slow but attention-taking movie. I would recommend the movie for all who like drama and don't mind with eventual humor in it.After watching the movie you might reconsider parts of your life and the meaning of human life itself. In my opinion the movie says a lot about changing ourselves and try to do a simple but right thing in life instead of trying to save or change the whole world. Many of the characters seem to find the meaning of their everyday work only after spending quite some times doing their job.,10.0,Anonymous,Music

A very delicate and serene reflection upon life and death,"Although not being myself a lover of Japanese movies, I decided to see ""Departures"", mainly because the recently released ""Poetry"", which I liked so much, was in a way associated with it. The two pictures are in my opinion distant as far as content, but similar for the mood pervading them, which is indeed part of oriental culture and which allows the viewer to approach the most strong and disturbing topics in a very serene way. Here the theme is death, in particular the special rite performed on corpses in front of relatives, before letting the dead leave, for good: it's a delicate, and very respectful sequence of simple but significant gestures which sanction the final reconciliation of this world with the next, a kind of reconciliation between arrival and departure. The movie manages, very simply, and using no virtuosity to reflect upon the theme of death, avoiding all macabre or morbid particulars, keeping a solid balance between drama and grotesque humor, but never abandoning its serious intention, and it makes the viewer reflect avoiding any anguish or uneasiness. Inevitably and significantly focus shifts continuously from death to life, particularly to the meaningfulness of life, no matter how socially successful you are, to the real founding human values of life. As a whole, a sweet, delicate, and in a way comforting picture, where the slowness of typical of oriental movies does not bore, but leaves space to deep and serene reflection. Very good performances by the two male characters, we can perceive the evolution and growing maturity of Daigo and appreciate the more quiet but reassuring presence of Sasaki. I would have never believed that a movie centred on death could have left me with such a feeling of serenity and peace.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Departures,"The film, ""Departures,"" filmed and directed by Yojiro Takita, was a very well put together film, in my opinion. One of the main themes was somewhat creepy. This theme was funeral services in Japan. However, the film also focused on other things like family and the circle of life, which were both heartwarming to watch. Although the services were exotic and different as to how we celebrate and grieve for the dead in the United States, it was very interesting and gave the viewers a very cool global perspective. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys learning about different cultures, especially cultures in Asia, including Japanese culture. This movie also had some comical parts, so the film was not just depressing and interesting, but also funny at some points.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Should have departed from the Oscar Award,"there is a beauty in this film that only the Japanese culture is capable of expressing it out. It is the same quality akin to the wabi sabi concept, where even the little things in life, and things which we often take for granted or stay away, such as death, have their own perceived value. Although the overall plot is rather shallow and at times comedic, the beauty that surrounds death and those that have to send off their kins away, is something that will keep anyone glued to the screen.Hence, it is a good film, and it is understandable why it beat other foreign movie contenders (waltz with bashir and entre les murs), however, I personally think that it did not deserve the Oscars, considering that many elements are still lacking in this movie. In particular, I find the lack of visibility on the outcome of the main character's messed-up life, or what he thinks about himself, a little disturbing, considering that most viewers have a severe lack of knowledge on the lives of people in this line of work. Too much focus was diverted to the job and the clients' feelings. If the director have add a little more to this movie, i might change this statement.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A beautiful & poetic movie ... but has some issues,"Okuribo has many qualities of classic, beautiful Japanese movies: a quiet rhythm that brings you along gently, a poetic setting re- enforced by the Japanese countryside so typical and so beautiful to look at.Seasons and the passing time, as is sometimes the case, play a great role in the movie. The topic of death is treated gently and beautifully, full of emotions and, again, poetry.What doesn't work is once in a while the jarring change of tones. One can argue this is Japanese as well, but it can be done better. The characters can sometimes be overdone, contributing to these moments where the poesy is broken.But it's still a great movie - you will cry! - well worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

While all cultures have their own customs, Japan's may be one of the most beautiful... and strikingly different than the United States, given that almost all the dead in Japan are cremated, whereas very few in the United States are.Making the main character a cellist is a nice touch in that it adds such great music to the moments throughout the film without making such music seem forced or out of place.

To Be or Not To Be...,"""Departures"" follows the life of Daido Kobayashi, a washed up cellist that attempts to find a new job and life back in his hometown. Little does Daido know, that when he discovers an ad for an opening at a departure agency that will change help him discover his real passion. Written by Kundo Koyama and directed by Yojiro Takita, ""Departures"" connects with the audience on a level that is very much opposite of its actions in the feature. The departure job that Daido ends up accepting is not for a travel agency like he and others thought, but instead, it is a funeral business that prepares the dead for their loved one's families and attempts to help the deceased, peacefully pass over into the next life. At the same time, we watch the arguments and solutions that occur between Daido and his wife Mika, as everyone encourages him to quit his job and peruse the passion of playing the cello in an orchestra. Overall, the movie ""Departures"" is a great example of what some Buddhist believe and how they treat the afterlife, as well as keeping a sense of entertainment through the journey of the protagonist searching for his true self instead of the self that is given to him by others or even the one that he thinks is the correct path. At its base, this movie shows the audience what it looks like to discover and pursue a person's authentic self that builds a level of identity that is real, true, genuine, inside of each one of us, and although it can change it is truly who you are at the core, and more importantly it is the one thing that separates everyone from each other because you are uniquely yours.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

This movie truly has nothing special to offer. While the story starts interestingly and with some comedic pats, it quickly becomes a boring nightmare, begging for fast-forwards. There is the element of beauty and elegance, and the relation between the encoffining ceremony and playing the cello that several reviews are mentioning but honestly, as long as a movie itself is not enjoyable (regarding the story, dialogues, or the general theme), elegance does not cut it.

Not at all, but it is sure that I stay even if there is a little prejudice for embalmer now. This work draws the fact. That is why this movie only impresses many people not the movie which only denies prejudice without accepting the fact. And it affects the Japanese society slowly.However, this movie is not the serious movie which merely approaches for death calmly. It sometimes takes in humor and the music is used, and there is the bright scene and is not too gloomy. A way of the approach is a good work.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Departures,"Departures isn't going to be my favorite movie of all times, in fact I would place in towards the bottom of my list.

First off the main character, Diago doesn't look like the right person for the job, but that kinda is the point. To me it just doesn't look right and I think it would be better if Diagonal was a little older. My second problem with the film is the fact that it was so slow.

Certainly A Departure,"A meditation on death that's startlingly different from a plethora of similar films on the subject. Daigo, a cellist in an orchestra, loses his job after its dissimilation. Fate forces him to move back to his hometown and eventually take a job as a mortician. As Daigo grows to respect the noble work that so many shun, he is forced to confront the past in the form of his father, who abandoned him as a child, and the growing disdain of his wife on the job he has taken up. Everything about this film is masterfully done. From the taut script, which allows the camera to convey much of the dialogue, to the remarkable understated performances by the cast, and Joe Hiasishi's silently swelling scoreevery element falls into place perfectly. The subject matter is handled with the utmost care, careful to be tasteful and not too serious or light. Even so, Departures managed to make me smile, think, and cry at relative intervals. At its core, it's a film with a universal message, that says: Mistakes, human differences, and even death should be embraced rather than scowled upon. Because really, aren't we all hurtling towards the same ultimate destiny? Memories are easily altered or forgottenit's the moments that are precious, in every lifetime, from this one to the next.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Departures: It's All In The Details,"2008's Academy Award Winner for Best Foreign Language Film didn't exactly come out of nowhere, but it was certainly the underdog in a race against Israel's Waltz With Bashir and France's Entre Les Murs. All three are worth seeing, but what makes Departures especially interesting is Director Yojiro Takita's filmography.Considering the last Japanese AA Winner was Akira Kurosawa (for a Russian-made film), Takita is in elite company, especially for a filmmaker who cut his teeth making Pinku films. Pinku (Pinku Eiga) is essentially softcore pornography, but like most things in Japanese Cinema, it's nothing like its American counterpart.Personally, I'm not a fan of Porn...but I am a fan of Pinku. The differences are myriad, but the fact a Pinku director would go on to helm a film as thought provoking, touching and poignant as Departures, comes as no surprise (even if it does suffer from unimpressive cinematography and a few corny moments). As much of a long shot as Departures was to win, the odds of an American porn Director making such a profound ascension to cinema's pantheon may be too staggering to even compute. http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Music
great compulsory viewing!,"One of the greatest films to come out of Japan, in their splendid tradition. Fully deserving the Oscar and the other awards. The story is a heavy one, in any culture. Death is not something we approach in detail, or want to get involved with. Yet it is rarely construed as an inseparable part of life, indispensable and best regarded as a continuation of our existence on a different level. It is our monolithical egoism to relegate death to a place we don't want to think of, to consider it bad luck (while it is a certainty) and to disparage those who are involved with it professionally. To such point we abhor it that whole operating systems of our civilization are created -religions- to deal creatively with the issue of death and reposition it as something exciting and wholly palatable. Masahiro Motoki is good in his ingénue role as a novice encoffiner, though sometimes inconsistent (his facial expressions are perhaps sporadically too loud given the topic). He deserves full credit as the originator of the story, as mentioned by director Takita in the DVD extras. Ryôko Hirosue is very credible as a young Japanese wife torn between obedience to the husband and powerful public opinion superstitionally opposed to all things ""bad luck"" of which death is the apex. Tsutomu Yamazaki (Kagemusha, Tampopo) is definitely the best performer, controlled, precise, airtight to the role. The film itself is carefully spinning, the story is developed patiently-yet never affords boredom-and the final superb. The visuals-especially the cremation fire transposed in the swans' takeoff- are achievements and the cello soundtrack fits perfectly the topic. All in all, great watching and a memorable experience.

Also I think that this film might be the first which has considered to show this delicate matter in such details making its message universal be it any place or religion.
The performances by the actors are also, not top notch, but still so convincing and realistic that you are able to relate to them and fell thier joys and sorrows, with the last scene asking you ; does your love for your family ever truly die.

Eye-opening film,"Eye-opening film featuring a struggling young couple moving out into the Japanese countryside and the husband finding himself a new job that turns out to involve the Buddhist ritual of 'encoffinment' which entails preparing a dead body with ritualistic cleaning and make-up for the 'onward journey'. This discreet but unguarded procedure is attended by the deceased's family with varied results and is astonishing to see. Perhaps we are witness more often than nessessary in this two hour plus film but it is quite mesmerising and interspersed with details of the couple's rather fractious relationship, the non search for the husband's father who left him as a child and many wonderful shots of the often snowy landscape. The film was a surprise winner of the Oscar for 'Best Foreign Film' in 2009 and I rather doubt that clips of the director's early work in the field of 'pink eiga' for the 'Molester Train' series were shown at the time.

"""Departures"" is literally a departure from the ordinary film.","Yojiro Takita has created a masterpiece of cultural and musical cinema that literally overwhelms the audience with humor, emotion, sensitivity and great talent. The story surrounds a Cellist in the symphony in Tokyo. He is Daigo Kobayashi, played so perfectly by Masahiro Motoki. His wife, Mika Kobayashi, played by Ryoko Hirosue, is equally as artful in her role as an adoring spouse willing to grow and learn in their marriage. After the symphony owner closes the organization, the couple moves to Daigo's original home town village where he is desperate for a job (now in debt for his beautiful cello). The very most outstanding role is that of Ikuei Sasaki, played so well by Tsutomu Yamazaki. He is the ""Okuribito"" or one who prepares the body for cremation. His believable and sensitive portrayal of this unusual job is remarkable. There are of course musical interludes with the cello as well as the symphony that powerfully supplement the already dynamic cinematic experience. It is not a film for those who are unable to appreciate the sadness of the death experience, however, I highly recommend this film and its honest approach to a delicate subject that is handled with dignity for one of life's most common experiences.

A Tea Ceremony for the Departed,"Departures (2008) is a fascinating mix of existential angst and Taoism. It is a celebration of life and death, of nature and civilization, of the complexity of beauty and the basic elements into which we all decompose.Daigo Kobayashi (played wonderfully by Masahiro Motoki) is a Grade B cellist in an orchestra that fails. His life, his dreams are crushed, along with his finances since he had gone deeply into debt to buy a ""professional grade"" cello. Not sure how to organize his life, he returns to his home town. Looking for work, he stumbles into a job as a professional who prepares bodies for cremation. Like the work done by the Untouchables of India, this is a profession abhorred by all who knew him as a child and an aspiring musician. Yet, he finds a new love of life, an appreciation for the beauty of the world about him. He also realizes that the ceremonial aspect of his work allows those who ""remain behind"" to resolve unspoken conflicts (afterall, this is Japan) between themselves and between themselves and the deceased. In rare cases, he even helps assuage the loss and bring happiness to those who knew the departed and can share their joy-filled memories with each other.It is a charming movie, full of reverence for life and a commentary on how much we take each other and the world for granted, until it is too late.Daigo's wife (played by Mika Kobayashi) ultimately affirms his profession. Although she says little, her facial expressions shout volumes. One is easily reminded of her role as the rebellious teenager Yumi Yoshimido in Wasabi (2001), with Jean Reno, another great movie that celebrates love and life, though a la John Wayne and Dirty Harry. Although Yumi was a much more talkative role, as Mika Koayashi the same face provides excellent and moving dialog, all the more interesting for its silence.Tsutou Yamazaki plays Ikeui Sasaki, Daigo's mentor, who sees instantly in the musician the sweetness and emotion needed to bring beauty and feeling the job of Nokanshi, the funeral professional who engages in a highly stylized ceremony before the family and friends of the deceased as the body is prepared. Ikeui performs his Nokanshi role with a beauty that is inspiring.The movie is long at 130 minutes, but never boring. If you have lost someone close to you, if you have stood on a mountain and smelled the aroma of trees and flowers and watched the clouds dance across the sky, if you have marveled that we are all literally star stuff, you will find this quiet mediation on life and the joy of living worth every moment of your time. Then go tell your children, your spouse, your significant other and your friends, how much you love and appreciate them. Then throw a party for no reason at all to celebrate the blessing of being a sentient being on the third planet circling an ordinary star in the outer third of a galaxy not really unusual or difference from millions of other galaxies in the universe. For, in the end, about 4-5 billion years hence, we and all that is of our planet will be cremated, just like the departed of the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

That's how one should make films,"The Japanese cinema is perhaps the world's best, specially in the medium of animation, where they lack anything resembling an equal given that only in Japan we have a truly mature animation industry. And in terms of live action films Japan is also a first rate power. Indeed, since the days of Kurosawa and Ozu, Japan has been showing to the world how to make films.And this film is indeed one of those that shows the dramatic depth of Japanese cinema. Hollywood is still a long way from crafting drama of the same caliber, perhaps because the American zeitgeist which is characterized by a life of plenty for most Americans reduced the capacity of Americans to experience drama and thus affected negatively the film industry. Japan was a country that underwent much greater suffering and whose culture is characterized by a mentality shaped by these constraints which resulted into a more strong willed population and thus cinema with greater dramatic impact.Rated: 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Music

New career brings new life's perspective,"Okuribito is a story of a young man who finds an unusual change in his career from a musician to a mortician. Needless to say, drastic change in his private life came along with it.Daigo (Masahiro Motoki) is a cello player in an orchestra, but one day finds himself out of work. Recognizing that he didn't have the talent necessary as a musician to survive, he starts to look for a new job. He finds an ad in the newspaper saying ""Help people travel"". Thinking that it's an ad by a travel agency, he goes for his interview. He's surprised that his monthly salary is over $5000 just as an apprentice. He also learns that an ad had an error in it and is told that the ad should have said ""Help people's departures"". He learns that his new job is actually that of a mortician. While not motivated, he takes the job because he needed the money, but keeps his job secret from his wife. New job bring much difficulties for him, but he finds different perspective on life through seeing people's reactions to the loss of their loved ones.This IMO is one of the great new movies that are coming out of Japan. Japanese are finding their niche in unique stories that explores peoples lives from a different perspective. This movie is one example. It's also a step up in Mokkun, or Masahiro Motoki's acting. He's been gradually working his way up, and while an accomplished actor in his own right, he's been challenging new roles that are experimental for him. He nails this one as a musician, mortician, and a husband that is in a compromising position.While not as big budget as Hollywood movies, these new movies from Japan are high quality and original, and should be considered as classics in their own rights.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Among the ten best movies i have ever seen...,"... and i have seen an uncountable number of them! Actually it had been a long time before such a piece of Art film came on my screen. Right then, out of the sudden, i heard the announcement on our national TV stations that they were going to play ""departures"", a film which was the Oscar winner for best non English speaking film of that year! The fact that it was Japanese and the synopsis of its script was nothing i was really enthusiastic about, and i would have probably missed it if i didn't read the reviews which were all very strongly recommending it. So, finally i found myself, that Sunday evening watching ""departures"", and a miracle happened! the -at the beginning macabre- script, became gradually more and more touching, then sad and finally heartbreaking, humanistic and tender so much, that it finally got me totally upside down out of emotion. Till that moment I had never come across anything like this! How could it be possible that something which could - at first sight- be considered ""macabre"" end up so heartbreaking? Only a real highly humanistic masterpiece could ever make it possible. And everything in this film is just a masterpiece of its own: Direction, photograph, script, acting and last but not least, its heavenly music which just frees your soul and lose your eyes to shed freely your tears! This music...Oh! there is something magic about it i tell you! That kind of music God allows from time to time to reach the earth as a present from heaven and probably as a reward for something good the humans may have done. In my case,Mr Hisaishi,the composer, through his divine music for this divine film, made me a Cello fan, and I do need to thank him for giving me this amazing feeling! If you haven't seen ""Departures"" yet, please try to do it soon as possible. It will fill your heart and your spirit with the finest kindness you have ever experienced coming out of a movie screen. It may make you feel emotionally shocked but it will also make you a better person for sure!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Excellent film!!,"I saw this movie two weeks ago, I'm completely impressed about the movie that was playing in my screen. Poor Daigo at the beginning, it must be hard to feel when you're so excited 'cause you're playing in a great orchestra and then, everything's over. His wife Mika is a very happy woman in my opinion, the charisma of each character is very particular, Daigo of course had some troubles to get used to his new job, but he had the skills to do it, the respect Daigo had when he prepared the bodies, the art he was doing there, man!, that was amazing. Some sad moments are seen in this movie, because it's hard to understand when somebody loved dies, this movie displays some reactions of different kind of people, some of them angry, some of them sad, but very particular, I Love the way this is displayed. Of course this movie hasn't sadness all the time, it has its laughing moments, the music is so beautiful too, the ""Ave Maria"" song is played when Daigo had dinner with his boss, that part is awesome, the scene changes when he's playing the cello in a beautiful landscape. I absolutely recommend this movie, it's something different, that's why I give it a 10 of excellent.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

The Most Touching Movie I Ever Saw...,"This movie is unique in every way. It has a neither inspired, neither copied story about a person who carry out the encoffining of deceased people and how his life goes around with his beautiful wife at the town of his birthplace, to where he moved in after his musical career in an orchestra failed miserably, making him question his talent as a cello player. The performance of the cast, most notably Masahiro Motoki is astounding. The way he goes around his uneasy job, telling lies about his job to his wife, dealing with the memories of his father who left him at an early age makes his performance really mesmerizing. Add the beautiful story and performance with the picturesque surroundings and wonderful score, you get a movie that really deserve the Academy Award For The Best Foreign Language Film.This movie is very different from the usual horror movie coming from Japan.

It shows their job as a beautiful and great thing. I feel kind of admirable to them.Treating a death means at the same time thinking about a life. Undertakers put on a lip stick on the lip casting their mind to the past of the body, that is, the time when he or she was alive. The film told me such a thing.

Exquistely beautiful,"Despite it's Oscar win, I had not heard of this film and stumbled across it on a cloudy day when I wanted desperately to see a movie that had substance and beauty, as there seem to be so few left.
I couldn't have found anything better - exquisitely beautiful and moving me to tears on more than one occasion, which is a rare thing for me in an era of false sentiment and schmaltz. This movie is neither of those, telling a deceptively complex and yet humanly simple story of a young man who takes on a job that others despise and makes it a work of art and compassionate career choice.
It would take too long to describe all the aspects here that touched, moved and resonated with me. Suffice to say that only in 'foreign' films can one find this depth and serenity in a film, a work of art, a gem, a masterpiece.

We Are Separated By The Idea Of Death,"I can't get the musical score of ""Departures"" out of my mind, and it is a good thing. The music is not exactly low-key and not so obvious. But it drives my heartbeat to the point of sorrow and joy all at once. Something only Japanese films can do. This little story of a young man found himself through the preparation of funeral services for others is most wonderful. While westerners tend to prolong the acceptance of a death, mostly by pretending that the deceased remain with them, the Japanese and most Buddhist orientals recognize a death right away, almost to the point of emphasizing. Death in Japan is thus a true death. With a true death, and no room for any denial, a person can truly go back in time and feel the total feeling. The young man never felt anything for his long-lost father until the moment of recognizing his death, and the love the old man had for him, which was never lost. This is not at all a complex movie. A simple story line and a few simple characters. No pretension. Such simplicity makes it memorable. Anyone who desires the meaning of life and living should learn something from the death in this film. Please watch it and perhaps reserve some more time in the future for second, or more, viewings. I learn a great deal doing that.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A contradictory feeling,"Truly speaking, I felt bizarre after watching DEPARTURES (OKURIBITO), not because I didn't like it while winning the almost most credible award; the Academy award, but because I really liked it. For me, the movie to some extent is mediocre; mediocre actors especially Ryôko Hirosue (the wife) and a predictable plot. Yes it's simple, yet predictable in many places. This contradictory feeling may come out of its witty execution dealing with an intense issue (death and probably life) that could have been handled through an overly dramatic way, but what really fascinating is being crafted in such light heartedly way. The first part has its reasonable share of humor but not slapstick comedy, then it deepens gradually to have its moving and emotional scenes supported by such a great sentimental score. Cinematography is also great and has its impact on delivering the scenes. What seems to be great fun is discovering more about the Japanese culture and traditions in a more rural but honest way, rather than the usual image of modern Japan, the matter that is reflected even in using a classical orchestral score. At last, a resonant line saying ""What I believed to be my dream, was probably not my real dream"" makes one think and may it be a turning point in someone's life as it was for Daigo.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"""The gift of last memories.""","""Departures"" is a remarkable film; it would receive widespread acclaim upon its release and would win the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2009 Oscars. The film follows Daigo Kobayashi (Masahiro Motoki), a cellist who would lose his job when his beloved orchestra disbands and would subsequently find a job as a mortician. ""Departures"" is tender and bittersweet look at death through the eyes of a mortician, and would delve into themes of life, death and honoring the memories of those who have passed away. It tackles death similarly to how ""Six Feet Under"" did in terms of balancing sadness, grief, and humor to beautiful effect.

A great drama about death,"The story is a great tale to tell. It uses nicely the length it takes to tell a detailed and complete story with many sub plots, which all of them completes full circle at the movie's end. The main story is told well using the midway point as its starting point. The neat trick about this movie is that it has more than a few significant characters, who has even clearer significance near the movie's ending, yet this movie is able to keep just Daigo as the sole focus of the story. The story gets more and more heart-warming and touching as it nears its end. I particularly like how the movie turns the people around Daigo from hating his job into embracing it and even being proud with it. And the ultimate finale is a great personal turning point for Daigo himself. The acting in general is a good overall work. Motoki Masahiro played Daigo well, encompassing enough expressions t cover his emotions, although a bit lacking at the most demanding moments. Hirosue Ryuko also did well as Mika, keeping consistency on his expressions that suits Mika's cheerful basic nature. Yamazaki Tsutomu leaves a good impression as the boss who often look emotionless.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
From someone who isn't a fan of foreign films,"I'm not a fan of foreign films and especially not Asian ones (speaking as a westerner). Recently I watched several Indian films which were enjoyable but they felt American and also unrefined.This movie was different, it wasn't non-Western really, but it certainly wasn't non-Japanese. I felt like I was meaningfully connected with a culture I knew very little about and I was very honored to have seen this film.The film tells the story of an emotionally stunted young man who is a cellist and suddenly finds that he is unemployed and must give up his love of music and quite despite himself finds something else he loves, sending the recently deceased on their way to the afterlife. But like the love of music, this is something many people cannot understand or tolerate in the young man. In many ways, his young wife doesn't understand him either and we are left to wonder if she ever will.Yet this is not really an art film, not one of those films where everything is left unresolved, but it isn't all neatly tied up either. It's a deeply satisfying and encouraging film.It reinforced something I have noticed about Asians in other contexts that there is a depth of beauty and emotion in Asian culture that as a westerner, I'm often tempted to dismiss or ignore because I can't easily understand it. Asians are ""weird"" to many Americans - but one has to ask why America should be the norm to the world? This movie was deeply encouraging, dealing with timely issues of fatherhood and marriage, and also subtly, the destruction of fatherhood in the world (which many of the newer Indian films are dealing with in another way).Asians seem to have very deep connections to their families and traditions that are falling apart as the world becomes more ""global"" - but those undercurrents are still strong and offer hope to a world that is weary with competition, cynicism and disconnection from family, from our traditions, from others and from ourselves.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

An exquisite film,"An American client, knowledgeable about Eastern ways, highly recommended Departures to me. It was nominated for an academy award for best foreign film, he told me. I read about the plot on IMDb, saw that it was about a Japanese man named Daigo who prepares dead people for funerals, and was immediately turned off by the idea seeing it. I told this to the client, and he said ""The East doesn't think of death that way. No preconceptions allowed! It is not a death movie, it is a life movie"".Having been gently but firmly rebuked, I returned to IMDb and read several positive reviews of the film. This time my impression was much different. I came to view this film with respect. It no longer appeared to be simply a ""morbid"" film, but a thoughtfully-made one, and representative of Japanese filmmakers' reputation for sensitive storytelling. With renewed interest in seeing the film, I told my client that I'd see it when I have time. I started watching it three weeks later.Not only did I watch it, but I managed to persuade my wife to watch it with me. Initially, she was repulsed by the sight of dead people being prepared for burial or cremation, and refused to continue watching the film. However, she overcame her disgust when I starting watching the film myself from where we had left off, a week later, and when she heard the beautiful music of the film's soundtrack. We saw the rest of the film together, and we both liked it.My wife was charmed by the sight of Daigo playing the cello, especially when he played on the hilltop. He was an orchestra of one.Daigo had a job playing the cello in an orchestra, but was forced to give that up when the orchestra was disbanded. He answered a help wanted ad, thinking he was applying for a job as a travel agent. Instead, he was hired to be a ritual mortician, a job which he at first detested and which made him sick. The pay was very good, though.The artistry of this film must be seen to be believed. Here are a few examples: there's a scene in which Daigo applies lipstick to the lips of a deceased wife and mother during the ""en-coffining"" ceremony: her husband and daughter express their heartfelt thanks to him after the ceremony for making their beloved wife and mother, respectively, appear more beautiful even in death. Another example: an old man prepares to cremate a deceased bathhouse owner, an important member of the community, while explaining his role as a gatekeeper to the next world to Daigo's former orchestral comrade. The comrade had reproached Daigo in front of the comrade's wife and child for doing such undignified work, and can now see the value of Daigo's work. The final scene is the final example and the ultimate climax. It was in that last scene that I most saw the resemblance to one of the best Ozu films a Dutch reviewer on IMDb mentioned in his review, even though I haven't seen an Ozu film. The scene is poignant; it is beyond astonishing, it is beyond extraordinary. It is magical.Throughout the film, the music is as moving as it is beautiful. It serves to reinforce the film's message that en-coffining is an honorable profession, one that helps the loved ones of those left behind find solace, even joy, despite the loss of their dearly departed family members and friends.The acting is superb in the film. I could feel the sincerity of the characters as I watched them go about their lives. Daigo, Mika, and Sasaki, especially, conveyed genuine feeling with their expressions and actions. As the actor who plays Daigo, Masahiro Motoki, had an enormous interest in the subject of the film – in fact he wrote a book on the relationship between life and death – this added considerably to the credibility of the film and his role in it.What is most significant to me about this film is the way it shows how one's choice of profession affects one's life in important ways. This film is about death, but it's even more about life and the effect that death has upon the lives of those who make it a profession, as well as those they care about. Moreover, there is beauty, even in death.Japanese culture is depicted in a realistic way. As an example, when my stepdaughter, who spent time in Japan, came to visit us, I told her about Departures, and she told us about the bathhouses in Japan. The bathhouse in Departures matched her description. The Japanese values of respect for one's elders, tradition and nature are much in evidence in this movie. The film accurately portrays the stigma involving death in Japan: that death in Japanese culture is thought to be a source of impurity and that those who work closely with the deceased, such as morticians, are considered unclean. It is this stigma which Daigo strives to overcome in his new career.I urge you to see Departures. Although it doesn't explore the religious side of the Japanese funeral ritual, it is nevertheless an artistic and reasonably authentic portrayal of its place in Japanese society. It's very likely that you will enjoy Departures, or at least some aspect of it, and that you'll find much meaning in it. The care with which this film was made will be become apparent to you as you watch it. It is truly an antidote for the crassness of the modern Hollywood film tradition, with its puffery and special effects mania. It is an antidote, for that matter, for the materialistic culture that we cling to so desperately in the United States.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Something else!,"It's not enough to explain the storyline or plot of this movie - watching it is something else. From the very beginning you see that although the film has a very morbid title and theme, that this movie is about much more than preparing the dead.Unlike most Japanese dramas this story shows the real, believable emotion involved in the lives of so many people. However, there's also a lot of very subtle but humorous comedy.It will get you close to tears - whether you often cry in movies or not(like me) - and again not just from the deaths. There's family tension, abandonment, pressure of social normality and love. This film is a gateway into real Japanese emotion - something that is very rare in the Japanese world.You will not forget this movie. It is the best I have seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

The beauty of a rite de passage,"A man loses his job and to fight his financial difficulties he takes a job where he has to prepare dead corpses for the cremation ceremony.Like ""After life"" (1998, Koreeda) this is a Japanese film about the dead. And like forementioned film the subject is treated with a touch of lightness (a tear and a smile). Unlike ""After life"" this film is not about the dead themselves but about the ones who are left behind. The purpose of the job of the main character is te provide them with one last beautiful memory.In the film the relatives of the deceased greatly value this service. It is striking that the job nevertheless has a very low social status. When the wife of the main characher finds out about the real nature of his job she describes his activities even as ""unpure"".So the film is not only about the rituals surounding the passing, but also about the internal (job satisfaction) and external (social status) motivations influencing career decisions.The cremation rituals shown in the film are rather labor intensive and the modern way of cremation is much more efficient. So the film also juxtaposes in a more general way traditional Japan versus modern Japan. In this respect it is also noteworthy that:the main character moves from the big city to a small village after losing his job.The relationship with his boss in his new job can be charactyerized as a master - companionship relation (see als ""Red beard"", 1965, Akira Kurosawa).An important cremation in the film is that of the owner of the local bathhouse, who resisted vehemently the closing of her bathouse in favor of new buildings.The film is also about the father - son relationship, but in my opinion this element is less successful.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Departures,"The film on Japanese traditions and rituals followed on a funeral serves as a timeless classic. The lead actor looks adorable. All characters are lovable. Music is heavenly and takes you into a deep love for the movie. Three B's (Bach, Beethovan, Brahms) add three B's (Beauty, Brain,Brawn) to the music. No wonder academy has picked the movie. The only problem is that the movie became predictable after one hour, after he picks the job. Also it is a bit unrealistic for a musician who just lost his job, to stay with a funeral job and not look for a music job. Apart from these super-realism still I love this move which doesn't get too melodramatic in sentimental parts with a fine coating of comedy at the beginning.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

A very good film,"Departures is an international film from South Korea. The film is about a Korean man who works in the orchestra as a cello player, but when the orchestra goes out of business, the man, Daigo, is forced to move home. He ends up getting a job where he does the burial proceedings. He is hesitant at first, but ends up realizing that this job is his calling. Overall, this movie was quite good and very entertaining. I would rate this film a 4.5 out of 5. Although, this film is quite different compared to American films.

Moving and funny,"Departures is a film that really messed with my emotions. I went from laughing out loud to being close to tears before an emotional but satisfying ending. It is not surprising that the film won so many awards upon its release and continues to be held in such high regard.One of the first things that struck me about the film is how beautiful the highly ritualised preparation ceremony is. The body is expertly washed and dressed while at all times remaining covered in a dignifying way. The way in which the body is expertly moved is almost like a dance and the ritual is carried out with mathematical precision. Despite being a very solemn affair, the film's opening scene is also very funny. Taking place two months into the plot, Daigo is seen preparing the body of a young lady for cremation. While cleaning the body with cloths he stops with a jump and surprised expression on his face. Quietly shuffling over towards his boss, Daigo explains that she ""has a thing"". Confused, the old man takes over before discovering the young lady's ""thing"" himself and carefully asking one of the relatives if he would like the deceased to be made up as a man or a woman. This opening scene sets the tone of the rest of the film by being both sad and darkly funny.The humour comes to a stop though around two thirds in when an event that although could be seen a mile off, is still upsetting takes place. Having battled for respect from those who know him, this is when Daigo gets the chance to show what his job really means for people and is one of the most moving scenes in the film, only beaten by the finale. A thread throughout the film is that of Daigo's relationship with his father, or rather lack of. He left when Daigo was very young and this caused a great chasm in his life. I had a feeling that someone in the story was going to turn out to be the father but was proved wrong. A central theme to the film is the family. Daigo's family is made up by himself and his wife but this is shattered when she is unable to come to terms with his job. Instead, his family becomes those he works with, his boss and the secretary. Another family is that of the bath house lady with whom Daigo becomes friendly. All of these families end up clashing either internally or externally, often with upsetting results. Something that is sometimes difficult to understand for a western viewer is the Japanese taboo of death and the funeral business. Although I didn't know this was the case before the film, it is made obvious throughout.One of the highlights of the film is the score. Much of the music is cello lead orchestral music and sounds beautiful. The score was composed by renowned Japanese composer Joe Hisaishi and lead actor Masahiro Motoki also learned to play the cello for the role. My only problem with the score is that the central piece of music, played over and over again bore a striking resemblance to the music over the Visit Scotland advert that has been playing in the UK for about five or six years.Departures is a beautiful, funny, heartbreaking and fascinating film with over fifteen major awards to its name. The acting is terrific and it looks stunning. I highly recommend it to anyone with even a passing interest in Japanese cinema.www.attheback.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,Music

The gift of the last memories.,"I think this movie is not about death or even nostalgia, but about how a person faces the mundane gaze in adversity. From caring about others' eyes to finding their own value in work, highly recognizing it, communicating with the world, and forgiving others to achieve their own rebirth. From this perspective, this movie is more like an inspirational film than a simple emotional one. The gift of the last memories The last thing a person buys in their lifetime (a coffin) is determined by others. """" Death may be a door, passing is not the end, but transcending and moving on to the next journey. """" An embalmer is to rejuvenate an already cold person, giving her eternal beauty, which requires calmness, accuracy, and gentle emotions.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A very beautiful story about death,"This man who comes from a very different branch of work, becomes an encoffiner -performing a ritual to send the dead people off properly, and humanely. This is also for the sake of family, this evokes emotion and memory of them suddenly seemingly almost coming to ""live up again."";
They shave them. Put makeup on to make them look less dead and alive again.They wash them, this is their last bath before departure and is also a symbol of being re-born. They also change their clothing, it is all done in such a beautiful artistic way that it looks like an art form when they do this, they may also put something on them that reminds them of them being them; a favorite lipstick, a scarf they might have worn often, etc.They also make this sort of art movement with their hands and arms, they touch and caress the person. This all helps the family to not hold back and get some relief from this, perhaps offering some sort of sight, a cry, to bring them to realization, and able to grieve. For them to almost make them seem alive again, one last time.It is also about that we should normalize death more, that this is also just a part of life, a process, like any other we go through with life -it doesn't have to be something to feel disgusted about... everyone has to die at some point, we can't get around it.And this doesn't have to be the end, but the gateway to starting their next new life somewhere else.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Beautiful and Poignant Movie about Life and Death,"In some ways, Departures reminded me of Alan Ball's Six Feet Under (2001 - 2005) Motivations between their two protagonists may differ but both share story of a man who went back to his hometown and found himself working at a job related with deaths that he though he is never gonna do in his life (Funeral Director/ Encoffinment) and both film and series are extremely good and rich with thematic elements in their own waysDepartures is simply a story about life that happens to exist between birth and death, it is about all the twists and turns in our lives, it is about all the opportunities we miss and we take. It is about how unavoidable death is and how it leaves feeling over a family, it is about all the lives we touch while we are alive. Most importantly it is about the role DEATH plays in Japanese cultureEvery aspect of this film is nearly flawless. I can't find any big or hugh mistakes rather than being predictable and oversentimental like most of modern day Asian movies but still from start to finish is absolute beauty and full with lives.
In our country we also have same sort of ceremony for the dead and I can tell you that the rituals performed in the film are carved with attention to detailsPerformances from everyone is top-notch, I had to say I am moved by performances of supporting characters rather than protagonist. Script, music and directing everything is superb. Overall, Departures is deeply emotional and humane movie about life and death with gorgeous execution",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Thinking of death is thinking of life,"Daigo works as a cellist of a orchestra in Tokyo. But suddenly it breaks up and he loses his job so he and his wife, Mika, goes back to his home. There he finds a help-wanted ad for ""travel agents"". He thinks it means travel agents as the name but it is, in fact, embalmers. That is to say, the travelers are ""bodies"" that goes to the other world. Fortunately or unfortunately he starts to work as an embalmer but his friends and wife are against his job. He himself has a difficulty thinking which job he should takes, a cellist or an embalmer. He, finally, makes up his mind.I began to think over mortality after watching this film. Being dead and being alive are too abstract to understand. But they are the closest to us, I think. No one does not face them in life. Everyone has chance to die so it is very important if we regard it as terrible or as great. The answer depends on situations because the way human dies is different from one to one. However the job of embalmers is a great one and necessary. Embalmer is far from dirty work. Thank to them we can leave for the next world beautifully.Please watch this film and reconsider mortality and life of ourselves.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Transcending To The Last Level,"In Yojiro Takita's heartfelt film,'Okuribito' (released in the U.S. & other English speaking countries as 'Departures'),Daigo Kobayshi is a cellist with a symphony orchestra that mainly plays to sparse audiences. When the owner of the orchestra drops the bombshell that he is disbanding the orchestra, Daigo sells his cello, and with his beloved wife,moves back to the house he grew up in. Seeking employment,he answers an advertisement proclaiming departures, figuring it's some kind of travel agent. When he discovers that,due to a print error in the newspaper that the job is preparing the dearly departed for the undertaker,he balks at the idea,but eventually warms up to the job. Daigo also begins to ponder the fine line between life and death & the relationship with his own parents (he lost his mother while on tour with the orchestra,and his father abandoned both Daigo & his mother when Daigo was only 8). This loving meditation on life and death is directed by Yojiro Takita,with a well written screen play by Kundo Koyama that blends drama,pathos & dark humour to put across the point. Masahiro Motoki plays Daigo,in a winning performance of a man coming to terms with life & death. Royoko Hirosue is his wife,Mika, who just beams charisma with every scene she plays in. Throw in some crisp photography and editing,and an enlightening evening of fine Japanese cinema is in store. Spoken in Japanese with English subtitles. Rated PG-13 by the MPAA for mature subject matter,and a bit of naughty language.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
My greatest film experience in years,"Depatures understands that life is not one journey for one person, that it is something we all collectively share. That all humanity is one endless ocean, and that we, the people in our lives, and the love we feel for one another creates ripples that touch, entwine, and push far out beyond our comprehension.Departures is about Daigo Kobayashi, an unemployed chellist who ends up respectfully and ritualistically preparing the bodies of the deceased to be placed in coffins, in an intimate ceremony in front of their families.While reluctant and repulsed at first, Daigo sees the reverence in his bosses's work and the way that love and respect translates to the departed's families as they say their final goodbyes.As he settles into his new career, Daigo returns to his cello. Music (and all art for that matter) is the only way to attempt to express our souls. Ideas and feelings we create at our birth and send beyond when we're gone.Departures expresses itself purely in actions and feelings. When Daigo (played by Masahiro Motoki) goes to his first job, he can't verbally express all the feelings that stir from experience to his wife Mika (Ryoko Hirosue) when he comes home that night, because he hasn't admitted to her what he's doing for work. The desperate way Daigo embraces Mika speaks to everything we need to know about how he's feeling, and the way we all feel when confronted with the certainty of death, because it reminds us to grasp at life ferociously.I will cherish that scene and this film as one of those rare lights in media, that will burn within me for as long as I'm able to carry it. And when I'm gone, it will continue to remind us to live, and love, and release our souls to the stars, and beyond.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Death And Intimacy,"Death is only a vague looming fear for most of us but for Daibo Kobayashi it becomes an everyday fact of life after he replies to a newspaper advertisement for staff in ""Departures"". His education is often hilarious if sometimes grotesque as he learns from his boss how to prepare a corpse for cremation, a job in days gone by done by the family of the bereaved, but these days performed by contracted professionals in the family home and in front of them and their guests with great ceremony and dignity. The job is not highly regarded, however, and he is seen as rather ghoulish by others (including his own wife!) but this only reflects their anxiety of saying a final farewell, movingly brought home when he is repeatedly given heartfelt thanks on leaving after having completed the job, and the relief of his clients becomes apparent. In a full 2 hours that never becomes dull his personal life, his artistic life and his professional life are kept in a dynamic and entertaining tension before the preparation of the corpse of his estranged father becomes a synthesis of all three in the last act of intimacy possible between father and son.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Beautiful,"The topic of death is interesting to many, you can't get away from it, so everything connected with it is guaranteed to attract attention. This Japanese film, which also received an Oscar, places the viewer in a different environment with different traditions and a different attitude towards death. Actually, I myself do not see much difference between the kingdom of heaven and reincarnation. The latter implies some kind of complete purification of consciousness, therefore it is the same death.The film turned out to be absolutely mundane in Japanese, but at the same time with a good claim to something valuable, to some kind of emotional closeness between people. The problem of death and the traditional rituals associated with it exists in Japan, but I never heard anything specific in the film. That is, I should only guess about something and take the director's word for it.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"Moving, engaging, thought-provoking movie","When his orchestra is dissolved, cellist Daigo Kobayashi is left unemployed. He and his wife move back to his home town where he answers a job ad, working with 'Departures'. He gets and takes the job, thinking it's a travel agency, but it turns out it involves preparing people for cremation or burial. Is he cut out for this and what will his wife and friends think?Great movie. Engaging story, as we follow Daigo and how his unexpected, and largely unwanted, role changes his life. Quite emotional as we see the effect his work has on people, how people respond to knowing this is the last they'll see of a loved one and how death can leave to recriminations and falling outs among family and friends.Thought-provoking, as we are left to ponder our own lives and how we handle death.Won the Best Foreign Film Oscar in 2009.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Japanese Art Film Wash and Prep Dead for Cremation Encoffiner,"Japanese film about a cellist turned funeral home worker won the Oscar for foreign-language film. Inspired by Japanese author Shinmon Aoki's mortician memoir, ""Coffinman"". Daigo Kobayashi is a devoted cellist in an orchestra that has just been dissolved & now finds himself without a job. Daigo decides to move back to his old hometown with his wife to look for work & start over. He answers a classified ad entitled ""Departures"" thinking it is an advertisement for a travel agency only to discover that the job is actually for a –Nokanshi- or encoffiner, a funeral professional who prepares deceased bodies for burial & entry into the next life. While his wife & others despise the job, Daigo takes a certain pride in his work & begins to perfect the art of Nokanshi acting as a gentle gatekeeper between life & death, between the departed & the family of the departed. This film won best foreign film Oscar 2009 81st Oscars. I was uncertainly about the word encoffiner. I could not find it in any dictionaries I wrote several & Miriam Webster replied the word has been in use since Shakespeare's time. The equivalent of a casketer in our context would be the embalmer or embalmer's assistants. (the bodies are not embalmed in Japan) Masahiro Motoki (The Longest Night in Shanghai) stars as the lead protagonist Daigo Kobayashi, a cellist in an orchestra & his wife Mika (Ryoko Hirosue). I especially enjoyed the casket business owner (NK Agency) performance (Tsutomu Yamazaki ) it was especially amazing, hilarious at times, and played with seriousness and comedy! He was so great in this role! Director Takita is a terrific visualist and the film's cinematography in and around this small town in Japan is phenomenal. It is really a beauty to behold. This is an excellent movie which covers ground not usually talked about in movies –the after death process. Japans rituals are much more unique & interesting than ours. It is a very well crafted drama with some very comedic moments. It does not get trapped into melodrama as some movies might have. Death reveals many things. Some maybe be harsh, some kind. This movie gives us an interesting look at all of them. The music is beautifully captivating in almost every scene of grief. The film could be criticized for its long length & sentimentality these were not negatives for me. Many in the film world were surprised and upset/angered when this film won best foreign film Oscar over the film Waltz With Bashir. It is a small film compared to Bashir (which was a really profound innovative film) I think this academy chose this film as it has a wider audience due to the film's earnest appeal for renewed respect toward the old & the dead. The film has also won 28 other prizes besides an Oscar. Departures is a somewhat difficult film to decide to see, especially after the story and theme are understood ( this is a movie about washing preparing dead bodies before cremation- not exactly the plot summary to encourage date-night romance or family night movies at home) The film covers heavy subject matter with delicacy, gentle psychology and at times comedic air. A cinematic masterpiece the film is highly recommended 5 stars (be sure and watch Waltz with Bashir also!)",9.0,Anonymous,Music

A very Japanese movie that also translates exceptionally to Western culture. Death is truly universal.,"The movie is based on a personal memoir of ""a Budhist mortician"", written by Shinmon Aoki, and is very well filmed and acted. The story is about a man who returns to his home town after a failed attempt at a career in the big town and gets a job as a mortician. What is not immediately apparent to non Japanese is that any job involving handling dead people is traditionally seen as unclean and that explains some of the reactions of the people in the film. In the end, helping someone pass through the ""gateway"" of death is presented as cathartic, noble and spiritual.A very beautiful film that I recommend watching. The only issue that I could see is with its length, which is a little over two hours.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Cinema Omnivore - Departures (2008) 8.3/10,"""Kimiko Yo is also excellent as the secretary Yuriko, care-freely buries her own poignant regret deeply under her amicable veneer until it is time to unleash it and leave Daigo stunned in the aftermath, but it does make one wonder why she cannot excel in the job herself, is ""encoffinment""a male-only occupation? Correlating to Mika's meekness, her own life exists only under the shadow of Daigo, one can quibble that DEPARTURES still sticks to the phallocratic shibboleth a bit too strictly. Other than that, and the plot being too predictable (it is glaringly obvious that Daigo's estranged father, who deserted him 30 years earlier, would only be reunited with his son by a ritual operated by the latter, and the ""stone letter""motif is also well expected to be drawn to achieve the final reconciliation), DEPARTURES is a master class of Japanese melodrama composed of its wabi-sabi world-view, mono no aware artistic expression and the cardinal ingredient of regarding ""death"" with an open attitude.

Departures film review,"The film Departures by Yojiro Takita introduced me a job I have never noticed: mortuary. As the characters in the film mentioned, having a work to do with dead people's body is a shame. However, I would think this kind of job is unusual, but not a shame, because every job should be respected. The main character, Daigo was first working in a band to play cello. When the band was dismissed, Daigo and his wife Mika moved back to his mother's old house, because it is too hard for them to afford the living expense in Tokyo. In the old town, Daigo found this job, and starting to work as a mortuary. All of his neighbors and Mika did not agree with him doing the job, but after seeing him doing the job, they realized this job should also be respected. I really enjoyed watching this movie because this is not just showing a plain story, but having many social and family issues like transgender and no parenting children. The burial custom in Japan shows that it is not an American film because there is no such custom that cleaning the body in front of its' family and friend.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Meaningful,"It's a film of a young man's vocation that consists in spreading peace of mind and soul through the execution of an exquisite ritual. At the same time it is the story of a marriage before the birth of the first child and a young wife's discovery what an interesting husband she has found. Also, it shows the constructive effect of a good father figure on an otherwise lost soul. The film has many moving, sometimes explosive scenes and is, in the end, I do not know a better word, ""meaningful"" in a mysterious way that cannot be described. I addresses and calms our fear of dying. The whole story is build around five mysterious ceremonies that contain and express what it means to be a human being.",,Anonymous,Music
A touching piece !,"""Departures"" is a very heart-touching movie that will make you cry sometimes -or a a lot- while watching the movie. The movie is a great change for people used to watch American and European movies . It's a chance to watch a different theme; the Japanese life-style that is full of great things. A nice drama that will catch you right from the start of the movie .However, it's not so much complicated story. You will get close to a lot of dead body scenes that fired the movie with a lot of sad moments but it will definitely make you think about purpose of your life and death many times . The nice touch made by this movie is that it will make you laugh and cry sometimes at the same scene. You will never regret it . Enjoy watching !",,Anonymous,Music
