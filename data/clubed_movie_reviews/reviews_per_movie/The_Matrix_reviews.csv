Just wow,"When this came out, I was living with a roommate. He went out and saw it, came home and said, ""Dude, you have to go see The Matrix."" So we left and he sat through it a second time. This movie is splendidly done. The mystery about what the Matrix is, unravels and you see a dystopian future unlike any we as a race would want. I have watched this over and over and never tire of it. Everyone does a great job acting in this, the special effects are above par and the story is engaging.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Benchmark forever.,"The Matrix - 1999This was a real change in filmmaking. Like watching it again in 2020, i.e. after 21 years and it still feels fresh. Iconic scenes are still having benchmarks setting up.If we say it sci-fi at its best, it won't be wrong. The hype was real, it is still not easy to match the level of Matrix where we experience the connection of humans and science, that too with amazing action fight and chase scenes, not just normal scenes they were, multiple exposures, slow motion 3D moves, Oh My God, and it's understandable as well like what are the characters up to and what storyline they are entering into. The script was very well written and executed otherwise it could have been a mess. A special appreciation in managing the theme with those black color costumes and a scientific zone with unimaginable equipment and props doing unbelievable things in the two worlds created. No spoilers, but the action scenes in the climax where the protagonist goes to save someone from agents are really breathtaking. The technology used at its best.A salute to Wachowski Brothers and the team for creating this masterpiece. It will be a great competition and motivation as well for many films coming in the future.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The benchmark for all sci-fi films to come,"The story of a reluctant Christ-like protagonist set against a baroque, MTV backdrop, The Matrix is the definitive hybrid of technical wizardry and contextual excellence that should be the benchmark for all sci-fi films to come.Hollywood has had some problems combining form and matter in the sci-fi genre.  There have been a lot of visually stunning works but nobody cared about the hero. (Or nobody simply cared about anything.)  There a few, though, which aroused interest and intellect but nobody 'ooh'-ed or 'aah'-ed at the special effects.  With The Matrix, both elements are perfectly en sync.  Not only did we want to cheer on the heroes to victory, we wanted them to bludgeon the opposition.  Not only did we sit in awe as Neo evaded those bullets in limbo-rock fashion, we salivated.But what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes.  The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky.  The kung-fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would've been proud of.  The photography was breathtaking.  (I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.)  And the acting?  Maybe not the best Keanu Reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did.  But, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside Laurence Fishburne, you're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting.  As Morpheus, Mr. Fishburne is simply wicked!  Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Mr. Fishburne.  His character, battle-scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh out.People will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the bottomline is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation.  My generation. The Wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little P.S. note when they finished the script saying: THINK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT YOUR EXISTENCE.  What is the Matrix, you ask?  Something that's closer to reality than you think.Either that or it's my personal choice for best film of all-time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

One of the best action sci fi action movies of all time!,"The film is as well crafted as the matrix itself! On another level entirely to any other science fiction film from the last 20 years .

"Immensely entertaining, intriguingly philosophical and just about one of the best films ever made!","Writing a review of The Matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore I want to do the film justice by writing a good review. To tell the truth the first time I saw the film I was enamored by the effects. I remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films I had ever seen in my life. Also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life, the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much. It wasn't until some time later (and after having seen the film a few times more) that I started to think about the film. I recognized the Christian elements quite quickly but it wasn't until I wrote an actual 15-page essay on the film that I tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more. I won't say that I have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with them.Acting wise the film works excellently. I won't say that there aren't any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless. Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix (and the sequels). He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and I certainly don't wan't to spoil it for anyone. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor (mostly in the sequels). Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 6 years later (my God has it already been 6 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.The reason that I think The Matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing I catch something I didn't see the previous time I watched it. Without spoiling the film I think I can mention a few of the more obvious elements. Obviously the film draws on the Messiah myth as Neo is a clear reference to Jesus with the analogy of his name (Neo = one, as in The One) but also hidden in his other name, Thomas A. Anderson. The first part of his last name, Anderson comes from the Greek Andros meaning ""man"" and combine this with the second part of his last name ""son"" and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination ""son of man"" which was a title Jesus came up with about himself. Also the first time we meet Neo a man calls him (and I quote): ""You're my Saviour man. My own personal Jesus Christ."" It doesn't get any more obvious than that. Aside from the Christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from Budhism, Gnosticism (Gnosis = knowledge) but is also inspired by Plato and his analogy of the Cave and Jean Baudrillard's essay, Simulacra and Simulations. Explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them I will not comment on them further.To all the people who doubt the profound nature of The Matrix I can only give one advice: Free your mind and watch the film again. You won't regret it. If I had to choose a favorite all time film my choice would probably fall on either The Matrix (obviously I don't expect people to agree but if they do thats great) or The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and I recommend it to all fans of sci-fi and people who like philosophy.10/10 - on my top 3 of best films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One of my favorites,"At first, I wasn't interested in seeing the Matrix. But after hardly hearing any bad reviews for it (and believe me, I hear bad reviews for every movie I enjoy) I decided to give it a try. At first, although I really loved the fights, graphics and characters, the plot confused me. (Anyone confused by the plot at all should go to www.knowthematrix.com and you'll find out everything you could want to know) By the second time I watched it, I really understood it, which made the movie even more enjoyable.I really loved this movie. Just about every character, good or bad, is very interesting and cool. The acting was excellent. Even though I think this was Keanu Reeves at his best, the best acting jobs were done by Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity). Hugo Weaving did an excellent job as Agent Smith and Joe Pantoliano was great as Cypher as well.The plot is one of the best movie plots I've seen in a movie. An accountant by day, computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we know it is fake and that we are actually in a giant computer program run by robots (that we created, of course) in order for them to get power. Not only that, but he finds out that he is one who is, according to prophecy, going to put an end to it. The greatest thing is that you learn things just as Neo does, so you can really relate to his character.My favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, you will learn more about it. I guarantee this. Some may not like this movie because the plot is too complicated, but I recommend that anyone who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Good but not ""The Greatest Film Ever Made""","Ok, I'm getting sick of comments saying stuff like ""The Matrix is the greatest film EVER MADE!""That's complete and utter bullturd. Yes, it had great cinematography and effects, yes it had a great soundtrack but NO WAY was the acting superb and NO WAY was the storyline great.Take that storyline and stick it in any other action movie and you would leave feeling disappointed at the end. It's major selling point was ""What is the Matrix? You have to see it for yourself."" Come on, the only plot twist was that thing to do with Cypher, and that wasn't greatly unforeseeable, there's things like that in every frigging action movie.The thing that set it apart was the ground-breaking camera effects, gnarly special effects and a funky soundtrack, as well as the costume design bit, with all that leather and expensive sunglasses. Without this stuff, all you would be left with is your average action movie.I'm not saying it was a bad film at all, just not one of the greatest.

a masterpiece,"and this is all. because each explanation sounds wrong. sure, the acting,, the plot, the fight/action scenes are great. maybe unique. but the essence, for me, remains the basic idea . a fake reality against the pure truth. and the magic as clothes of each character. because it is more than a film. it is a revolution in the way to see a film and to discover reality. you are Neo. and the mythological mix of symbols and cultural references and the simple story who seems have more and more levels are more than fascinating - it is real. sure, Matrix has a lot of reviews and around it is very easy to say hypothesis, verdicts, opinions or, maybe, critics. it is enough to say it is a masterpiece. or the perfect fascinating fairy tale.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Almost my favorite movie ever! The metaphors/quotes should be more known!,"Truly a masterpiece in every way! If it wasn't for Fight Club this would my favorite; I've been on the fence about it. The Matrix along with They Live have the best metaphors about life/society, most of which a lot of the population aren't woke to!For example the entire speech Morpheus says ""The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. That you are a slave, Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind."" Among other brilliant quotes like when he talks about what the world has become, then mentions we have become this referring to a battery. So many genius lines I could list that I won't.The effects, stunts, lighting, sounds, and tone are outstandingly spot on! They really did train for the fight sequences for months I've seen all the special features plus more. Yes this is a sci-fi film, but I see it as a documentary as well. We're all slaves that take the blue pill throughout many things it's just hard to realize that. I also love what someone else said, it's a benchmark for sci-fi to come, that is very true and it's the last of its kind; movies aren't made like this anymore!A lot of people worked hard to make this film what it is. I respect that; I've always wanted to work on film just haven't had a way for many reasons. If you've read this far or even at all thanks and sorry!

Welcome to the Real World.,"Without a doubt one of the best and most influential movies of all time, the Matrix is the defining science fiction film of the 1990's and the biggest leap the genre has taken since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The Matrix is a ground-breaking motion picture that not only raised the bar for all the science-fiction films to come after it but also redefined the action genre with its thrilling action sequences and revolutionary visual effects.The film tells the story of Thomas Anderson a computer hacker that in the world of hacking goes by the alias of Neo. When he is contacted by the mysterious outlaw Morpheus and having always questioned his reality, he is awakened to the truth that the world he's been living in is a simulated reality called the Matrix and that he's nothing more than a slave in this dystopian world, created and controlled by A.I powered machines.The direction and script by the Wachowskis is fantastic, as they drew ideas and inspirations from every other great sci-fi and cyberpunk movie and anime before the film, combining it with stunning action and putting it into one picture that has enough style, substance and subtext that everyone ended up giving their own interpretation of the story. The research that went into the preparation of the screenplay is quite extensive but the manner in which it is presented on the big screen is also very impressive. Every character presented on the film, has a well-defined arc and a purpose, and their motivations are clear.The cinematography is impeccable. It was very innovative in the use of the camera angles and movements, the zooms, the slow-motion captures and the different color palette used to differentiate the Matrix and the real World. The editing is flawless, as it makes sure that every scene is integral to the story and ensures the pace of the film stays ferocious through its entire runtime. Each frame is also packed with so much visual information for the viewer to devour. The visual effects introduced us to the bullet-time effect and their impact can still be felt in today's movies. The performances are also incredible. Each member of the cast gave their best performances and brought the characters they portray to life, but the one that stands out the most is Hugo Weaving's disciplined rendition of his character, Agent Smith; a powerful computer program made to search and destroy the human rebellion, in undoubtedly the greatest performance in his career.In conclusion The Matrix is a masterpiece everyone should see. It is one of the most thought provoking, inventive, pioneering, influential and stylish movies of all time and it's also full of philosophical and religious allegories waiting for interpretation. Immortal for its contribution to cinema and pop culture, its brilliant combination of inventive visual effects, excellent vision and exquisite action easily makes it one of the best, most influential and most entertaining movies ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Still hip as heck even after 20 years,"You name it. Technology, CGI, flow of the story, the concept, action, romance, style, music,... everything you want is realized in this movie to the level of perfection. The scene where Neo and Trinity go to the virtual reality to save Morpheus is so fashionable that I screamed. The camera angle, costume, music, and the gunfights.. all these qualities shine the heroes. The entertainment value of this movie should not be overlooked because of its high quality and philosophy.I can see how much research Wachowski sisters put in to make their imaginations and concepts realized in the two-hour movie in plausible ways. How is dystopian future and present is connected? How does dream within a dream work? All the questions about their imaginary world is answered because they pay attention to details and they explain every existence and terms with logic one step at a time. There is no leap of logic, very tightly well-woven script.Their concept is not just future or imaginary anymore. In 2020, we see AI taking over many of works and jobs that humans used to do and invading privacy. Virtual reality games gain popularity over time, and you see Neo everywhere who adapts quickly in the Internet world and learn the combat game so fast and naturally.The impact of 'The Matrix' in the movie industry is more than imaginable. Of course, revolutionary visual effects with elaborated CGI techniques created iconic bullet-dodging scene of Neo. Because the Matrix system in the movie is kindly well-explained, it widens a scale of sci-fi genre. Hunger Games, Inception, Eagle Eye, Wall-E, and so many other movies that followed benefited from this epic work.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"20 years on from release, some random thoughts on revisiting The Matrix. Spoiler: It's still brilliant.","20 years after its release, and several years since I last saw it, some reflections on the experience of rewatching The Matrix. In no particular order ...1) It still look great. I mean, this is one amazing, stylish looking phone. Very little about the look of the film has dated - the mobile phones, obviously, Neo's computer, and very briefly a couple of visual effects creak. But otherwise, this looks as amazing at it did on release. It's sumptuous.2) I think I was one of the many who misjudged Keanu Reeves all those yeas ago. I made easy jokes about his vacant stare and apparent intelligent. From this vantage point we can see he's been in a good number of successful, intelligent films. It's also become clear that within the industry he as a reputation as decent, hardworking man who is a pleasure to work with.3) It's apparent again how literate and cine-literate the film is. I knew this 20 years ago, but since then I've seen a lot more films and read a lot more books, and this time around I especially loved the way the film nods its head to other film genres and influences. I noticed a lot of Peckinpah, and did I see a nod to Kurosawa there too? And I was reminded that for an English Literature graduate like me, this is a goldmine of quotes, allusions and references.4) Seen 20 years on, its influence on cinema since is clear. There's a lot we could talk about here, but I was especially struck by how indebted a director like Christopher Nolan is (keeper of the flame of intelligent blockbusters), especially with Inception.5) I'd forgotten that the narrative ostensibly maintains uncertainty about Neo's identity until just before the end. I'm not sure this really works - anyone who's read many books or ever done an anagram will not find that the most suspenseful part of the narrative.6) Despite a run time of 2 and a quarter hours, it never flags and attention never wonders. The film fizzes with kinetic energy and the time flies by. It's a lean film, without a wasted moment.7) The film is, of course, packed with religious allusions. When I wrote a chapter on this for my BA Theology dissertation, I said I thought the film was neo-Bhuddist (forgive the pun, please), and I stand by that on rewatching. Of course, there's lots of allusions to Christian and other theology, and The Matrix spawned some really bad reading of film by Christians which has never really stopped. When will some Christians learn to read a film/book etc with integrity and understanding of what the film is trying to do? It's a spiritually confused mish-mash of a film - but still a gloriously entertaining one.8) All these years later, it turns out The Matrix was somewhat prophetic about the role technology would play in our lives. Humans permanently plugged in to networks? Different layers of reality that are somehow more real than what we think of as real? The Wachowskis saw all that and more coming 20 years ago. Artists are the weather vane of society; we really should learn to pay attention to them.9) Bottom line. I still bloody love this film. I'm trying to work out if I have the requisite strength to revisit the sequels....",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"The more you watch it, the better it gets","The Wachowski brothers really did excel themselves with this movie. It's a brilliant movie on a number of different levels - the directing is excellent, the camera work is great, the visuals are stunning, the kung-fu is A+, acting is executed with style and conviction, and the plot is truly inspired. It's really hard to use enough superlatives on this movie!It'd be a 10/10, except for the ending. Having Neo do what he does at the end really lets it down, in my opinion. However, there's a couple of sequels on the way, so let's see what the Wachowskis can do to make up for it.Other than that, (and like I said above) the movie is operating on so many different levels that each time you watch it, you pick up something new... this isn't by accident, either. The Wachowski brothers had the actors read a number of definitive works (Simulation & Simulcra was one I believe) in modern literature and psychology, and applied liberal dashings of aspects of the major religions to provide the best sci-fi movie of the decade, if not ever.I'm yet to meet somebody who hasn't enjoyed it.

Good film,"Good film. The humans are planted, so why need to give them a matrix? All they need to do is just find a way to keep the human energy alive. The film is so pretentious, and has this confidence that is smart, but has one of the most cop out endings in a blockbuster movie. Trinity saves Neo with the power of love. How is something like that left in a ""cerebral"", ""philosophical"" movie, when it has an ending that belongs in fairy tales? It's stupid, forced and doesn't add up. So for all the rant this review has, is the film terrible? Not quite. In fact, it's a decent movie with some clever ideas and analogies, and props for having a major impact on film making and actually trying to do something different in the action genre as well as blockbuster movies, but it's not really the masterpiece it is claimed to be.

"What is the Matrix?  Well, one of the best films ever, for one thing...","The Matrix...when I first heard about it, I expected just another sci-fi action thriller.  Good and filled with insane stunts, but not terribly intelligent.Boy, was I wrong.  Oh, the stunts are there in spades, all right, and yes, they are awesome.  And the special effects are absolutely amazing (even if similar ones have been used in other movies as a result- and not explained as well).But the movie has plot as well.  It has characters that I cared about.  From Keanu Reeves' excellent portrayal of Neo, the man trying to come to grips with his own identity, to Lawrence Fishburne's mysterious Morpheus, and even the creepy Agents, everyone does a stellar job of making their characters more than just the usual action ""hero that kicks butt"" and ""cannon fodder"" roles.  I cared about each and every one of the heroes, and hated the villains with a passion.  It has a plot, and it has a meaning...and lo and behold, a plot does help the fight scenes!  Just try it, if you haven't seen the movie before.  Watch one of the fight scenes.  Then watch the whole movie.  There's a big difference in the feeling and excitement of the scenes- sure, they're great as standalones, but the whole thing put together is an experience unlike just about everything else that's come to the theaters.  Think about it next time you're watching one of the more brainless action flicks...think how much better it COULD be.All I can say is WATCH THIS MOVIE.

A sci-fi action thriller milestone,"'The Matrix' may not be one of the very greatest examples of its genre (like '2001', 'Metropolis', 'Blade Runner', 'Back to the Future', 'Star Wars Original Trilogy', 'Alien' and 'Aliens'), but that it is revolutionary in how its visuals and use of sound broke boundaries like had never been done before cannot be denied.It is not a film to be seen if people want character depth or relationship depth, with the forced and underdeveloped love subplot between Neo and Trinity being 'The Matrix's' sole weak spot. This ended up not being that huge a problem for me because everything else is so well executed.Particularly striking about 'The Matrix' is its production values. Simply put, the film looks amazing in its audacious production design, dazzling special effects that are some of the most ultra-cool and imaginative to exist, super slick editing and often jaw dropping cinematography. So much more than a film with ground-breaking special effects and use of camera work that broke boundaries.Use of sound was also striking, and how the pulsating and hypnotic music score was used. Andy and Larry Wachowski direct adeptly, while the script is an intelligent mix of complex and well-explored themes, mysticism, philosophy and even Lewis Carroll and the story is often invigorating and intensely taut with a smart concept brilliantly done.Action is superbly shot and edited, and the way it is choreographed is relentlessly intense and breathless in its energy, Kung Fu has rarely been more vertigo-inducing (despite how this sounds, this is not a bad thing as it added hugely to the intensity and paranoia of the story's atmosphere) on film.Keanu Reeves is in one of his best and most iconic roles and has never looked cooler, certainly has not looked this comfortable for a while before then. Carrie Anne Moss is strong. Even better are an imposingly charismatic Laurence Fishburne (also in one of his best roles), an amusing Joe Pantoliano and a deliciously wicked Hugo Weaving.Summing up, not one of the best of the genre but a mile-stone nonetheless and a great one.

Most over-rated movie of all time,"Really, my summary says it all.It's a cute premise overwhelmed by its need to be cool at the expense of plot, characters, meaning, or consistency. It has philosophical and literary pretensions that come off as kindergarten philosophy at best and ham-handed at worst. Luckily, these can be ignored fairly easily.Good action sequences for the most part. Most of the cast is summer-movie capable. i.e. Their acting is neither embarrassing nor impressive. Keanu gives his second-best performance ever (after Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure). Unfortunately, that is likely merely the convergence of his naturally confused look with the confusion inherent to the character.All things considered a fun action movie provided you don't buy the hype telling you that it is so much more.By the way, stop with this one. This movie is watchable and complete in its own and is only degraded by its truly dreadful sequels. If this movie is the triumph of style over substance, its sequels are the cruel beating and maiming of substance by style gone bad.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"at last, something I can recommend","The first 45 minutes of this film had me very excited. It is so rare that I will go to the theater and be presented with something which is both original and intelligent. It managed to hang in there throughout, though the ending was too formulaic. In addition, the voice-over at the very end reminded me of the final scene in Saving Private Ryan. It almost ruins a fantastic film.The only other objection I can come up with is that the you must know, you must be type philosophy being handed out was just a tad hokey. I must pleasantly admit though, since I don't get to admit this very often, that The Matrix is worth seeing despite these things.The visuals are extremely impressive, particularly the ""white room,"" the baby harvester, the training scene with the ""red woman,"" the Reeves interrogation scene... I have to agree with some of the previous comments that the plot idea won't seem overly original to a fan of Philip K Dick, but then what is original after you've read him? The Matrix has more original things to say than two months worth of standard Hollywood fare. I have a great deal of respect for a film which will have someone say ""they're turning humans into this"" and hold up a battery. A plot which looks at man as machine will get a thumbs up from me just for trying.I feel some hope for the future of movie-making in America to be able to recommend this film.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Once in a lifetime film experience,"Never will there be a film that can harness the creative worldbuilding, mind blowing story, and intricate themes of social commentary as well as The Matrix can. I first watched this film when I was merely 12, and was absolutely blown away by it, and rewatching it now, i'm so glad to catch so many little things that add to the depth of this film and its storytelling. The Wachowski's have created something masterful here, creating a dystopian sci-fi world unlike any other before it and managing to not only build upon it greatly throughout the film but allow the audience to be immersed within it as well. It's a movie that makes you think, and it may start off a bit slow because of that, but it knows what it's trying to do, and it doesn't need to apologize for it. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, and Carrie-Anne Moss provide for excellent leads throughout the film. The cinematography is unique and gritty, its action style more than entertaining, and its deeper themes of societal norms and challenges make for quite an interesting commentary. Its special effects may not have aged very well today, but at the time they were quite unique and it fits the films vibe in a way that truly has to be seen to be believed. In the end, The Matrix is a sci-fi masterpiece and no one can tell me otherwise. Its an intricate and beautifully executed blend of action, sci-fi, and potential and just may be one of my favorite films the 1990's had to offer.My Rating: 9.9/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One of the best movies ever! (This review is only about the original Matrix movie),"The Matrix is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made!I read it used to be one of Tarantino's favourite ones too, but the second and third ones ruined the whole beautiful idea and brought the overall value of the movie pretty low.The story/philosophy is mind-blowing and the directing, special effects and the overall performance absolutely amazing.Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is an IT specialist in his day-to-day job and a hacker (alias Neo) during the night. He is looking for Morpheous (Lawrence Fishburn) who could give him the answer to the question 'What is the Matrix?' The more relevant questions to ask, though, would be ""How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?"" and ""How would you know if what is happening right now is not a virtual reality?""The antagonist, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), is one of my favourite characters. Just watch his mouth - the way he speaks, the tone and pitch of his voice, his pronunciation, even the pauses he makes while speaking, have an incredible effect on the viewer. The concept of people being like cancer to this world is absolutely astounding.Carrie Ann Moss was the perfect choice for Trinity because any other blond, big lipped, big brested 'bimbo' would have totally ruined her character.A few more questions pop up in one's mind. ""Haven't we gone too far creating such super intelligent machines?"", ""What if they become so powerfull one day and take control over humanity?""The acting's just amazing, all of them, no exceptions. The 4 leading characters though... (Morphy, Trinity, Neo & Agent Smith) - (yes, to me there are 4 leads) - I love them all. I can't imagine the movie with any other 4 actors but L. Fishbourn, C.A. Moss, Keanu and H. Weaving. They were born to play those roles.Whoever did the casting did a terrific job. Bravo!Brilliant, absolutely brilliant!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

*A Powerfully Provocative Nexus of Reality and Illusion*,"In the realm of cinematic landmarks, few films have blurred the lines of reality and provoked philosophical ponderings quite like ""The Matrix."" Released in 1999, this groundbreaking film from the Wachowskis isn't merely a visual spectacle; it is a thought-provoking exploration of existence, consciousness, and the nature of reality itself, making it a masterpiece that resonates profoundly even today.""The Matrix"" catapults audiences into an intricate universe where humanity is unknowingly ensnared in a simulated reality created by artificial intelligence. Keanu Reeves delivers a stunning performance as Neo, a hacker drawn into a rebellion that challenges the very fabric of his understood world. This narrative is punctuated by striking characters, each embodying profound philosophical archetypes; Morpheus, with his unwavering belief in prophecy and fate, and Trinity, who symbolizes both strength and connection, serve as guiding lights in Neo's journey of self-discovery.The film's visuals are nothing short of revolutionary. The signature ""bullet time"" effect not only redefined the action genre but also serves as a metaphor for the clarity gained when one awakens to the truth. With every slow-motion leap and gravity-defying dodge, the film invites viewers to question their perception. The stunning choreography of the fight scenes-elegant yet visceral-transports the audience into a world where every choice reverberates with existential weight.Beneath this dazzling exterior lies an intricately woven narrative rich with philosophical inquiry. The Matrix poses questions that tug at the very essence of human existence: What is real? Can we trust our senses? In an age increasingly dominated by technology, the film's cautionary tale becomes strikingly relevant. It dares us to reflect on the data-driven realities we inhabit and challenges the notion of choice when confronted with overwhelming digital influence.The film's infamous ""blue pill/red pill"" dichotomy embodies the quintessential human choice-between comfort in ignorance and the painful truths of reality. It speaks to the dissonance many feel today amidst the barrage of information and entertainment that can distract us from authentic experience.David's haunting score, combined with a distinctive, neo-noir visual style, enriches the film's atmosphere, creating a sense of foreboding and urgency as the protagonists navigate their treacherous world. The dialogues are imbued with philosophical depth, offering nuggets of wisdom that resonate long after the final scene.""The Matrix"" is not just a film; it is a cultural phenomenon that transcended its genre. It invites viewers to ponder profound questions, urging us to look beyond the surface of our existence and to consider the forces that shape our realities. As we navigate a world rife with virtual experiences and complex technologies, ""The Matrix"" remains an enduring beacon-a challenge to seize our autonomy and discern truth from illusion.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but highly overrated.","First of all, the movie isn't that bad to watch. It would be a genuine delight to sci-fi lovers. But I don't think it deserves a 8.7 rating and a place in the IMDb top 20.One thing that doesn't delight me is that the main strength of the movie which is about the computer simulation isn't an original idea. There have been lots of theories regarding it. And the plot is very simple with many plot holes. Neo as the chosen one isn't portrayed correctly. I see no special abilities in him.Fights were really silly and were too long where you get bored and just want to skip them and I see no reason why trinity fell in love with neo when they didn't spend any time together at all , just because a fortune teller told her that she would fell in love with the chosen one , is it how emotions work? Well , I don't think so.Apart from these there are a bunch of positive things too. Special effects were awesome considering that this movie came out in 1999. The idea of the story is innovative for Hollywood and matrix came out in era where there isn't much interest in sci-fi among filmmakers while the thrillers ruled them. So these things made it highly rated back then in 1999. Watching today wouldn't make much sense considering that special effects based movies are ruling the theaters now and every now and then sci fi movies are being released.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Wow! I Finally Saw It!,"This is one of those movies that ""everyone"" has seen, except me. I tried to watch it with some friends about fifteen years ago, but they had two kids under five years old and I was only able to ingest it in five minute increments. So a friend lent me the video and I finally got a chance to see it. It's a pretty remarkable film. The premise of an alternative reality works here where it often fails. Keanu Reeves is a sort of messiah, not by his own choosing originally. He has been attacked and abused by men in sunglasses whom, we find out later, are a part of a representation of Artificial Intelligence. The side Neo ends up on are the original humans whose ranks have been nearly driven to extinction. Laurence Fishburne is the leader of the rebels and he believes the the Reeves character is ""the One."" I thoroughly enjoyed it but would have like a little more creative final scene. Too many shell casings. Apparently, weaponry didn't advance much in twenty years. But, it keeps one on edge with its special effects and its non-stop action.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
New meanings,"The Matrix is one of the best science fiction action film directed by The Wachowski Brothers. The film has influenced both the cinema industry and the computer entertainment industry.

Reality is the only what we see and feel.We can understand the movie in different ways. You will see what you emphasize.

A great epic that sets the stage for the next level in sci-fi...,"Who is to say what is real or not? We are defined by our view of reality, no matter how twisted or demented it is in comparison to 'normal' people. *evil eye* Yes, I see you all, looking in the mirror, trying to decipher whether or not your view is the reality we all share.The Matrix not only supplies the world with a whole new level of special effects mixed with style and substance, it also brings a whole new meaning to the word 'paranoria'. This is one of those great epics that becomes a milestone in our present day world, a mark for which just about everybody can appreciate. Not since the original Starwars trilogy has a science fiction film reached across almost the entire population and gripped it with awesome special effects, great sound, and a overall feel of ground breaking movie making magic. It also serves up a good dose of paranoid delusions we all need in our lives every now and then.With that, I leave you with the fact that I've seen more different types of people liking this one film than most other films to date.

A very deep film- if you only watch films at your local multiplex,"I missed this when it was first released. However, at the time I saw clips of the fights scenes and the slow mo bullet sequences and was duly impressed. What would i think of the film on first viewing almost 20 years later?I never lost interest during this film and I can see why it was such a huge hit in 1999. Its heartening when any highly stylised film which isn't utter base level bilge to take megabucks at the box office.But heres where The Matrix succeeds brilliantly. It offers mind blowing concepts- but isn't too deep. It offers striking visuals- which unfortunately quickly became de rigueur as many other films, commercials and pop videos copied this visual style. Not the fault of the filmmakers and as they say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.Certain parts of the film feel like a comic book fans fapfest. The costumes assumed by the main protagonists would only be thought cool by basement dwelling geeks. Black PVC, long coats and clumpy boots- a cyberpunk's wet dream. Soo late 90s.But this film did dare to take to the masses something original and daring. It succeeded. Fair play especially in these times of stale remakes and turgid reboots. But don't try to interpret things too deeply. Beneath the surface isn't a whole lot of depth or substance. Precisely why it was so massive.The scene need the end where we learn that Neo really is 'the one' is one of the most bombastic, unintentionally hilarious sequences in modern cinema. I don't know if its pure cheese, genius or both. Which is noteworthy in itself.But for a film that tries to show us what the modern world is really like and what it revolves around I'll still stick with They Live. A film that accomplishes its mission statement with less gloss, has infinitely more depth, substance and charm and does so on a substantially smaller budget than The Matrix.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The most overrated film ever,"Yeah, the effects were good.  But the story was just your basic, run-of-the-mill futuristic action script.  The character development is virtually non-existant, the acting is weak, and their are non plot twists that cannot be spotted a mile ahead.  The only reason this film is praised so much is because of the martial arts sequences and the effects i.e. the famous slow-motion bullet shots.  But the fact remains that this is a poor effort.  There is no outstanding reason to see this movie; there is no great acting.  The story is intriguing to sci-fi fans at first, but later on boils down to cliches and shootouts.

"Let's ponder on the influence of ""The Matrix"" to the whole industry...","It is funny how it has been 15 years since ""The Matrix Revolutions"", bringing the movie trilogy to a close.

Okay, so what would be an EFFICIENT way to produce power for a worldwide computer network?Vast facilities containing huge tanks filled with methane-producing bacteria that drive gas turbinesThat may be EFFICIENT, but it's not EXCITING, Frank. You can't make a MOVIE about that. How about vast facilities containing HUMAN BEINGS who are all plugged into the Matrixthat's our working title, The Matrix. So they're all plugged into the Matrix because the computers of the Matrix are using them as a power source in their quest for control of the worldAGAIN with the nitpicking about why? See, we're thinking that the humans are kept in these vast hives of cells of, like, amniotic fluid, hooked up to tubes that feed them and wires that connect them to the MatrixThey're fed a nutritious liquid. I don't know where it comes from, or who produces it! I don't care and neither will the audience!So the people spend their entire lives floating in these little podsNo, they don't exercise, they just floatAtrophy? Osteoporosis? How do they have babies? I don't know, special mating pods! You don't have to be awake to produce semen; every teenage boy knows that. How are they plugged into the Matrix? Wires, of course, you know, implantsI don't know who implants them---robots! It does seem pretty far-fetched, but if I didn't think of those things, neither will an audienceWell, you see, they're all living in this imaginary virtual world that the Matrix computers have designed to look just like real life in the real worldbecause the computers have found that the people produce more electricity that way than if they're just asleep. Why? To sell the screenplay, that's why! So I figure, if their MINDS think they're exercising, their BODIES will think so, too. You know, it's like if you dream you die, you really will diepseudoscientific claptrap? No, what it is, is SHOWBIZ, Frank. But there is a small population of humans who have disconnected themselves from the Matrix and are alive and aware of the real world. They live in a secret city called Zion and are trying to overthrow the Matrix. How did they get disconnected? What do they eat if the world has been laid waste? Who cares? So they're looking for The One, who is the human who will have the power to control the Matrix instead of the other way around, and they find him, a guy named Neo. They manage to unplug him from the Matrix, and he awakens to the real world. It's really cool; we're going to put in all sorts of metaphysical Zen stuff about reality versus illusion and fate and stuff. Where did we learn about Zen? From our massage therapistNeo joins them in their fight. How do they fight? No, they don't blow up the main computer, that's the neat part: They fight the Matrix in the VIRTUAL world. You see, they can plug back in to the Matrix and so enter and leave the virtual world at will. So they fight enemy COMPUTER PROGRAMS, not the physical computer. How? Get this: Lots of way-cool balletic kung-fu stuff like Jackie Chan and lots of balletic gunfights like Chow Yun-Fat, only computer-enhancedLots of mayhem from beginning to end. Why? Because it SELLS TICKETS, that's why!The evil computers are looking for the rebels with machines in the real world, too, and Neo manages to block the computers from destroying the rebels in reality by fighting them in the virtual worldBecause that's the way to plan for sequels, that's whyWell thanks, Frank, you've been really helpful. If we sell the screenplay and it gets produced, we'll get you some free passes. Then you can see all your great ideas on the screen.'",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
I know this will be unpopular,"OK- don't get me wrong this was a groundbreaking movie. However I have some serious problems with it.First the good. The action scenes and special effects are awesome. They really did set new standards and knocked that hackneyed load of tripe The Phantom menace into the bin. The ending is also fantastic- there is no way that an ending this perfect was meant to be followed by two mediocre sequelsHowever, The plot is more full of holes than a fishnet stocking. For instance- I know this is nit picking- but how can Cypher be betraying the crew when not only do they have to plug him into the matrix for him to go and meet the agents in the first instance, but are also monitoring said conversation.Secondly- the philosophical parts. The matrix basically asks the question is it better to live the dream. The flaw comes in that in this case it is quite clearly better- great, so mankind is not ""free"" but each person lives a sufficiently realistic existence inside their own head for it not to matter. If the alternative is living in fear and squalor, dodging sentinels whilst eating what looks like congealed semen then I would frankly rather live inside my own dreams dining on fine food etc.Next up, the acting. Could someone please explain to me how Keanu Reeves is a leading man. He single handedly trashes all the good work put in by the supporting cast- especially Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving. Anyway how can I be expected to take a film seriously where Keanu is effectively god?Overall, a reasonable film but not the second coming of Christ so many people think it is.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Ultra cool sci-fi,"The Wachowski brothers have created one of the more interesting sci-fi world. Neo (Keanu Reeves) is a computer hacker who has a nagging intuition that the world is wrong. He is literally Alice who goes down the rabbit hole and finds his world is actually Wonderland. It marries Lewis Carroll with HongKong Kung Fu wirework and the back trenchcoat. They invent bullet time and amp up the cool factor in gun fights.The story borrows heavily from a lot of different sources. Machines have taken over. The world is a computer construct. People fight using computer avatars. These are all ideas that have been done before. The Wachowskis have weaved it all together into a functional tapestry.But it is ultimately the cool visuals that makes this movie unique. For a relatively lower big budget, the production value is incredible. They have squeezed every movie magic out of all the visual and computer effects.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Your mind constructs all these categories and distinctions.

50 years at a max the Matrix movie will become our real world!,"I find it strange that most of the people who watched Matrix were only attracted by the visual effects and overlooked the scientific facts on which this movie was based.People enjoyed the flying mostly and hence liked Matrix 1 more than they did with 2 and 3 although the answer was in part 3 that is who will win the war eventually between humans and machines. Some people they make fun of the idea that one day humans will be in direct war with machines but those people have not read yet about the Nano technology. The latter technology offers something like the software which teaches Neo how to fight in little time. Well through Nano, they will be able to plant a brainlike chip which works 10,000 times faster than our brain and they are now trying to optimize the speed limit in a way that doesn't endanger our brain which might be burnt working under such speed.As for the flying part, it is very possible if the science of Psychokinesis is given more consideration and in the near future I reckon they will with the evolution of human body which is going toward less and less movement. Has anyone seen the prototype of the new cars which have no pedals and we use sticks to drive and direct the car in different directions.Well, I guess the movie has tackled all these scientific aspects alongside psychological and philosophical ones in a very brilliant way and I 100% give this move 20 on a scale out of 10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The Matrix has Buddhist  themes,"A large part of the appeal of 'The Matrix' for me was the special effects and action-packed scenes. But, on reflection, part of the appeal is also its philosophical and religious underpinnings...When asked whether Buddhist ideas influenced them, the Wachowski brothers offered an unqualified ""Yes!"" and at a very basic level, the movie portrays two levels of reality: our everyday existence and a deeper, more significant, underlying reality (the matrix). This is very much like the Two Truths in Buddhism: relative truth, in which everything is perception, and ultimate truth which is the way things really are (objective reality).Because of our ignorance, we mistake the everyday world for something real and objective, and this is the cause of our suffering. As in 'The Matrix', breaking through relative truth to direct contact with ultimate truth represents a high spiritual attainment, some would say enlightenment, an awakening. (Remember the message on Neo's computer screen: ""Wake up, Neo!"")Mahayana Buddhism suggests that there are great spiritual warriors (like Neo?) who are walking the path from ignorance to enlightenment, and who can in turn guide us on the path.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The Movie That Bends Reality-and Blows Your Mind,"The Matrix isn't just a movie-it's a cultural reset. This film redefined what sci-fi could be and literally left my brain scrambled in the best way possible. There's ""great"" and then there's The Matrix level. Let's be real-this movie is an 11/10 because it took everything we thought we knew about action, philosophy, and filmmaking and turned it upside down.Keanu Reeves as Neo? Absolute perfection. He starts off as a regular dude stuck in the system, and by the end, he's out here dodging bullets in slow motion, questioning reality, and literally becoming ""The One."" It's impossible not to root for Neo as he navigates the layers of this dystopian world, and Reeves' iconic coolness makes the whole journey legendary.The action scenes? Next level. From the mind-blowing bullet-dodging scene to that rooftop battle, the Wachowskis changed the game with their insane choreography and visuals. Slow-motion, 360-degree camera spins, martial arts that feel like poetry-this is the movie that made us all want to learn kung fu (or at least pretend we could).But what really makes The Matrix more than just a sick action flick is the story. The whole concept of questioning reality, breaking free from the system, and figuring out who you really are? It's the ultimate ""wake-up call"" movie. It's got layers on layers of philosophy, tech paranoia, and human struggle that hit hard, even years later.And let's talk about the supporting cast-Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus is the mentor we all wish we had, and Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity? She's a badass from start to finish, breaking stereotypes and just oozing confidence and skill in every fight scene.Visually, The Matrix is still ahead of its time. The green coding, the dystopian cityscapes, the machines-it all blends seamlessly with the mind-bending plot, and it still looks SO clean today. Every frame feels iconic.The soundtrack? Straight fire. Rage Against the Machine's Wake Up closing out the film? Chef's kiss. Every song fuels the adrenaline and tension, making the entire experience feel epic.The Matrix isn't just a film, it's a full-on experience. It makes you question reality while delivering some of the best action scenes ever filmed. 11/10 because it's the ultimate sci-fi action movie that blew everyone's mind and keeps doing it, no matter how many times you watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"""Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself.''","I've heard a lot about this movie over the years, but I never got around to watching it until now. I finally did, and I have to say-it was absolutely amazing! I really didn't expect it to be the kind of movie that it turned out to be, but I was pleasantly surprised in the best way possible.At first, the plot was a bit confusing, especially in the beginning, but that's totally normal. We, as the audience, know just as much as Neo (played by Keanu Reeves) at that point, so the confusion is intentional. But once everything starts to make sense, it's incredibly satisfying. The whole concept behind the movie is really unique, and it definitely makes you stop and think-what if the world actually worked like this?The practical effects are seriously impressive, and even the CGI still holds up remarkably well, especially considering the movie was made in 1999. It's clear a lot of care and attention to detail went into making everything look as cool as it does.All the action scenes are spectacular, but that final act? Wow! It's one of the most entertaining and exhilarating things I've watched in a long time.

And now introducing the Wachowski Brothers,"Every so often a movie will come around to challenge the minds of the people; make people think, ""What if..."" ""The Matrix"" was such a movie. ""The Matrix"" took an idea that was not entirely original and took it to another level. The concept of machines rebelling against their human creators had already been explored in successful movies such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Terminator"", but never had a movie dabbled with the idea of machines being triumphant and eventually enslaving all of humankind.""The Matrix"" as a story alone was extraordinary. The Wachowski brothers obviously put a lot of thought, time, and energy into the story alone because it is without equal. The story itself triggered thoughts of ""What if we are plugged into a matrix? How would we know?"" And it also spawned many contemplative conversations all over the country if not the world. The Wachowski Brothers covered even the most minute detail with regards to the matrix: its origin, its function, its current state, and it flaws. Each scene and each conversation seemed to be carefully chosen and put together so as to convey the plausibility of the matrix.Then coupled with the great story was almost equally fantastic directing and special effects. Before ""The Matrix"" none had tried or adequately tried the still shot and pan. Almost immediately into the movie we get to see a shot of Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) jumping in the air, then being frozen perfectly still while the camera pans around her, before she proceeds to kick butt. This movie had no shortage of special effects and action blended it perfectly with critical and revealing dialogue.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
There's something very familiar about all this.,"I've always called the first Matrix film a rip-off. It's a mix of many different films put together with component parts stolen from the Terminator (robots rule the future and have enslaved the remainder of humanity), Total Recall (futuristic 'Is it a dream or reality' sci-fi) and even Johnny Mnemonic (futuristic cyberpunk trash starring Keanu Reeves as a guy who can plug computers into his head and 'go into them'), plus various other works by William Gibson and a lot of Anime.Thomas 'Neo' Anderson, is a computer programmer/hacker who meets with the mythical cyber-terrorist Morpheous, who asks Neo if he wishes to know the truth about the world or live a lie forever. Neo chooses truth and soon wakes in a gel-filled pod in a techno-hell future. His body, and billions of others, is nothing more than a battery to power the machines that rule the future (exactly what they do with this world that they now rule is not explored).Convinced that Neo is 'The One', Morpheous trains him to be deadly digital warrior, but this set-up doesn't go beyond fighting a sentient program called Agent Smith. The war against the machines comes later.There's no denying that the film, unfortunately, was massively influential for virtually every action film that followed. Gone was the 'Die Hard' formula where action was gritty, somewhat realistic, and with practical stuntwork. In it's place they all went for excessive CGI, green-tinted photography, impossible cameras, and impossible physics. The Matrix is semi-stylish with it, but it doesn't ever entertain or excite me.It's the style of the Matrix that's more fondly cherished than the story. It won 4 technical Academy Awards, proving that all the Matrix is is eye-candy. Call that narrow-minded if you want but I believe this movie is no more than a very, very popular cult movie. A contradiction in terms yes, but still the most appropriate way of describing it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"One of the best DVDs out so far, much more than just a movie!","December 2019 update. My wife and I just watched this again on Blu-ray, even though we have seen it multiple times it still is captivating. Simply a marvelous movie, and some might make the case that this is the best movie ever made.This is a review of ""The Matrix"" on DVD.If you like sci-fi action movies, this is certainly one to watch, even to own. For what it is, I give it a ""10"". It kept me wide-eyed all the way through. I'm sure I'll be saying the same thing after my 20th viewing, sometime in the year 2015.

But, the ""extra"" features are a big reason to buy the DVD.One ""extra"" is the whole movie played at a subdued sound level while the editor, special effects supervisor, and actor comment on their own reactions and explanations of various scenes.Another ""extra"" is playing the movie in normal mode where a white rabbit appears during certain scenes. If you want to see how that scene was filmed, you can click when the white rabbit appears and it will take you to the ""behind the scenes"" shooting. Then the movie resumes.There also is a featurette which shows how the entire movie was filmed. Or, you can play the musical soundtrack alone.All in all, a great action sci-fi movie with the most interesting set of ""extras"" I have seen so far on a DVD.

Disguised Scientology?,"A lot of people like The Matrix because they think it's deep. In fact its apparent deepness is its primary selling point, and is what has turned it into a blockbuster and trendsetter. Just ponder over this, because there's a contradiction here. Whenever has Hollywood hit the jackpot by being profound, either in a philosophical or religious way? Something strange is going on here. A lot of the mystery disappears after we identify exactly what belief the Wachowski brothers are purveying here. It's Scientology. They are telling us that the power of the mind is able to free us from the matrix of the senses. The scientologists are anxious to free themselves and become thetans – omnipresent and omni-powerful minds.Now, the success of The Matrix tells me just one thing, that people have become closet scientologists. They don't grapple with the issue of ""appearance and reality"" in the way scientologists do, but the core belief is there. They might call themselves an atheist, or an evolutionist (""We only accept what science tells us""), but that's only an excuse for not really sorting out what they really believe in. So, along comes a film called The Matrix and it hits a chord. They can identify with Neo because they are aware of a thing called corporate media manipulating reality for them. They are also brought up on computer games, and so it's not too big a leap to imagine a virtual world completely replacing the real one. I can see how closet scientologists can completely immerse themselves in the plight of Neo and his Christ-like struggle to free humanity from the clutches on the senses and become omni-powerful minds (in the parlance of the film, taking them to promised city of Zion).In that sense, the film is profound, in that it resonates with popular belief so accurately. There is just enough spattering of science and philosophy to take them in. People want to believe in science, but they don't want to be troubled like Einstein was (""Does God play dice?""). The most convincing part of the film is where Morpheus demonstrates to Neo how virtual reality is created. This, and the recurring motif of ""freeing the mind"" are the only authentic components of the film. The rest is a conventional Hollywood action flick, and one that is totally at odds with the underlining philosophy. Considering the struggle with agent Smith, and the frequent popping in and out of virtual reality, nothing makes sense. This is where real confusion starts to parade as profundity.I always thought that it was only intellectuals who mistook confusion for profundity, but apparently normal cinema-goers do too. Maybe intellectuals and Hollywood action flick fans have something in common after all. They both worship the rational mind. And when rationality delivers a mess, the mess itself is seen as something profoundly rational. Maybe that's the crowing achievement of the Wachowski brothers. They have composed the ""Being and Time"" for the masses. But Heidegger's philosophical book was mostly pretentious garbage, and so is the Matrix.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Great philosophy, not just a thrill ride.","The Matrix is a stunning, fast paced movie with lots of great special effects, high action, and a great soundtrack.But...is that all it is?No.  It isn't.When I listen to people talk about this movie, or read reviews by people who don't like it, the main problem they seem to have is the the plot, which they claim is mind-numbing, inaccessible, or just plain dumb.  They claim that the reason the movie is so popular is because if the special effects.Those who make these claims are just a little clueless, and the true art of storytelling is lost on them.Here's why.  Every story that we see on screen, read in a book or on the web has been told before in one fashion or another.  ""Jurassic Park"" is nothing more than a retelling of ""Frankenstein"" when you get right down to it. What catches our attention is when the story is re-told in such a different light that we like the retelling without really being called back to an earlier version.  The ""Jurassic Park example can work again for this point.  No one sees it as another retelling of ""Frankenstein"" at all, or at least, they don't dwell on the issue.  Shakespeare didn't create any stories....he borrowed from other texts, used other sources, and used words to his advantage.  The whole thing involves what is called ""intertextuality"", a term that I won't go into here, but is what I am trying to explain in the brief example of ""Jurassic Park.""Okay, stop yawning.Now, the Matrix has done the same thing, and what is funny is that very, very few people have recognized the major source of the story ( I wonder if the writers really know ).  I have heard that it is supposed to be Christian themed, and while there is some imagery in that respect, like a character named Trinity, Neo's death and rebirth at the end of the movie, the ship's name, etc. etc. etc., the list can go on.  But it has nothing to do with the story, which borrows very heavily from a philosophy written by Plato, of all people, back when the years were still labeled as BC.Plato wrote a philosophy, the actual name escapes me, but I keep hearing it referred to as ""The Cave.""  In this philosophy on the workings of a society, Plato stated that if you were to take four people from the day they were born, tie them to chairs so that their heads cannot move, and place them in the back of a cave where they cannot see the opening, nor have any daylight. They only have contact with each other.  Now, on the wall that they are facing, they can see shadows moving, be it a shadow puppet play, or whatever you can imagine, but all they see are those shadows.  You leave them in this cave for 20 years.  The only life that they know is the chair, and the playing of shadows on the wall.  They will not know the shadows are merely shadows, nor will they know the idea of freedom, and they will now know anything of the real world.  Then, you release one man, let him wander the world for awhile.  He sees that the world isn't just shadows on a wall, etc etc.  If you put him back in the cave, he will not view the shadows the same way that he once did.  He will also try to enlighten the other three that the images on the wall are only shadows, and that there is a beautiful and colorful world outside their cave.  But they will not believe him, and will even begin to see him as a blasphemer, and an enemy.WHEW!!That's the basic story in the Matrix.  Neo has been removed from the cave, and has seen the real world, and now knows he has been seeing shadows his entire life, and his mission is to make humanity realize that they are seeing shadows as well, but until that time, he will be regarded as an enemy by those still inside the cave.  The agents are the keepers of the cave, and the Matrix itself is the shadows that we see.  When you see this connection, the story can make more sense to those who can't quite understand it.And so by blending old, old stories with modern filming techniques and great acting by all involved and fast paced action, there is something to be said about this movie being a work of art, because it truly is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"The most influential and refreshing science-fiction movie since ""Star Wars"".","""The Matrix"" has redefined the science-fiction genre. Previous to this movie, most science-fiction movies consisted out of scene's in space with spacecrafts, aliens, all set in a futuristic world. Most movies that tried to be different from this, mostly failed. ""The Matrix"" does however does not fail and it redefined the science-fiction genre and has taken it to a whole different and more seriously taken level of movie-making. The movie has inspired many different movies ever since and showed that science-fiction and action elements are a great and spectacular combination. From that perspective ""The Matrix"" is one of the most important movies for film-making, from the '90's.This is a superb piece of movie-making. The Wachowski 'brothers' were obviously inspired by the Japanese anime style and they transform that style spectacularly into a life-action movie. Because of the style and flair of the movie, it makes the action look spectacular and even also look as something totally new. The fantastic bullet-time effects were something unseen before and are already alone reason enough why this movie is already almost a classic and certainly unforgettable movie. The style and new effects used in the movie make this movie to be also a refreshing one. It's an extremely original movie, both story-wise and technique-wise.Especially the action is what truly makes this movie a success. The fight and action sequences are beautifully choreographed. It also all is beautifully shot by cinematographer Bill Pope, who uses some fantastic lighting and camera-angles at times. The musical score from Don Davis is also quite good. Also the costumes and settings most certainly do not disappoint. The special effects are spectacular and also something totally new at times.The cast is not the strongest element of the movie. Keanu Reeves is fairly good as the main character but he lacks some charisma at times. Some goes for Carrie-Anne Moss to be honest. Actors who do not disappoint are Laurence Fishburne, Joe Pantoliano and the fantastic Hugo Weaving in his real big breakthrough role. He is an excellent 'villain' because of his look and way of acting.But what really makes and shapes the movie is its story. Yes, it's complex and believe, not everything makes sense or is explained in a satisfying way but it at least is something totally original and imaginative. The story really shapes the movie and its style and make the action and science-fiction elements of the movie work fantastically together.The movie is great non-stop spectacular action entertaining that doesn't even get slow or boring even when nothing is really happening. This is mainly due to the imaginative powerful story of the movie. If you don't understand and/or get the story the first time, just watch it a second or third time. The movie is worth it. The movie uses multiple layers, symbolism and elements from religions and other styles of movie-making. It makes you discover more new things, every time you watch the movie. One of the most original and influential movies from the '90's and therefor also an absolute must-see!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"A bit overhyped, but with lasting influence","This movie is one giant plothole based take on some philosophical issues, that has proved to be hugely influential. Quite original for a Hollywood flick, it is often given more credit than it deserves. The giant plot hole is that using people as batteries makes absolutely no sense. Contrived in its core, it however delivers many themes and is a decent movie, and the influence it has ups its rating a bit. But lets not get over ourselves, this is not Terminator or other such gem, not by any stretch. Still, worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Perfect sci-fi, great action and perfect plot for the internet loser generation (like me!)","Neo is a computer programmer by day and a internet hacker by day.  When he is approached by the shadowy terrorist Morpheus he chickens out and gets caught by the secret police.  However later Morpheus grabs him again and shows him the truth  that his life is a virtual reality provided by computers while his body, and the bodies of all other humans are harvested in pods for energy.  Morpheus believes that Neo is the one who will bring down the matrix and return humans to the planet's surface, however the computers seek to kill the small group of humans who exist outside of the pods.  Neo learns to control the matrix to battle the computers.Has anyone not seen this?  The plot is a perfect set-up for all teenagers who believe their dull lives must be fake and that they can be a gun battling hero.  That's the story of Neo and it's well told  we have Neo in the matrix, Neo getting trained by Morpheus and then returning to battle the computer drones.  The story is involving and the effects make it totally convincing.  The plot is clever and never totally falls into action for action's sake.  Although the first half is far superior is better than the second which does tend to give into the rules of Hollywood excess.The action is fantastic.  After so many spoofs and rip-offs of the effects and martial arts (Charlie's Angels etc) it's easy to forget how amazing it was when it was first done here.  Here it is done well and isn't treated like a joke like it was in Charlie's Angels.  The plot being set in the matrix means we can accept the effects as part of a VR creation and take them seriously without thinking they are OTT.  The only thing is that the action is so attractive that it's almost sexy  but should we find two trench coating wearing people walking into a building and killing dozens attractive?That aside it's cool to see wire work put into Hollywood movies (and done well too).  Reeves is cool and is suited to the role.  Fishburne is even better  how does he keep those glasses on?  Carrie Anne Moss is good but falls into the role of love interest later on.  Pantoliano is good and Weaving is slimy as one of the computer sentinels.The plot is good and opens itself to a nice religious interpretation that isn't very well hidden.  Neo is `the one' who has come to save mankind, Trinity is a character etc etc.  How this sits with the violence is anyone's guess but it makes it quite a nice distraction.Overall this is very enjoyable and very well scripted.  The only down side is that the fantastically choreographed fights and gun battles really glamorise violence to a worrying degree.  However if you're watching an action movie then that's what you accept otherwise don't watch.  For me  I can't wait for the sequels.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"I Can't Tell You How Bad ""The Matrix""- but I'll try.","I made every effort to be open minded about ""The Matrix."" I put aside such questions as ""Why does Hollywood see Keanu as a cyberpunk? How came everyone is making making a big deal about these fx which you can see in shampoo commercials?"" I can honestly say I gave it every chance. The fact that the creators were trying to create fully developed worldview was admirable, and the movies surprises hadn't yet been revealed.So as the movie rolled, and I got too see one of the worst, most painful movies I have ever seen, I could honestly say it wasn't me. I enjoy scifi and Hong Kong films, enjoy Philip K. Dick, so I was basically the ideal audience for this film.The plot was so full of loopholes, maintaining suspension of disbelief was impossible. Except for one or two supporting cast members, the acting was lifeless, and the action was unsupported by any motivation. The antagonists were far more sympathetic than the protagonists, whose cold-blooded killing sprees did nothing to endear them to me. Finally the washed out lighting and coloring took away a lot of depth from the images.. when someone seems to leap from building to building, if the buildings look collapsed together, it's not that impressive.And the fighting.. when you watch Jet Li or Jackie Chan fight, even when they are obviously assisted by wires, you feel an exhilaration at what they are physically capable of doing. The fights flow, and the character is maintained through out. In The Matirx, there is no real joy or sense of exertion. People punch each other, pull some interesting feats, but without any sense of risk or accomplishment.What people saw in this waste of film, time and money, I do not know. But I include it with the American remake of Godzilla as one of the worst movies I have ever seen. If you want Phillip K. Dick reality warping, see Blade Runner. If you want good cyberpunk anime, see Akira or Ghost in The Shell, or for martial arts, a good Bruce Lee or Hong Kong flick.But don't waste your time on this.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Whoa!,"With The Matrix having already received 3294 comments and 342,457 votes (with an average rating of 8.7), the last thing IMDb needs is another rambling review from an avid fan describing in precise detail why this film is such a revelation in terms of action and sci-fi cinema.What I will say is that the film is a stroke of genius that taps into the subconscious belief that our reality is not all it seems to be and mines it for all it's worth, developing a philosophical mythos of biblical proportions in the process, whilst introducing technical and directorial innovations that will be mimicked for years to come.It also features some kick-ass fight scenes (with jaw-dropping choreography by HK legend Yuen Woo Ping), a superb metal and techno soundtrack, and the awesome sight of Carrie Ann Moss almost completely clad in black PVC (or is it rubber? Oh, who cares... it looks great!!!).In short: with The Matrix, the Wachowski Brothers have given sci-fi fans one of the finest films of the genre ever.What a shame they had to go and make those sequels!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Dynamite to my Brain,"Strangely, Matrix is one of the few action films that open my brain to deep, profound thinking while at the same time it magnetizes me with the most brutally good action scenes. Putting together the thinking line of the new generation, where we are just but pawns in a system we don't understand or belong, Matrix also borrows a lot of the oriental culture with the fights and it's inner travel over the nature of Life.Little by little one will start to see the light, and everything will make sense. By the second view, you will get a higher conception. By your third view this will amaze you.Brawn mixed with brains. The Matrix IS the science fiction film.

uninvolving sci-fi thriller,"As the world and the movies head into a brand new millenium, old narrative formats have been gilded with all the techno/cyber concepts and jargon that now inundate us in our daily lives.  In no areas of filmmaking is this more true than the action/adventure and sci-fi genres.  Probably the most popular example to date comes in the form of ""The Matrix"", a film that actually chooses as its setting a never-never land located somewhere between reality and the abstract plane of cybernetics.The plot of the film, though too complex to reiterate here, is actually put forward in a fairly straightforward, comprehensible manner.  What is missing from the film is the essential grounding in reality that makes the audience care if the main characters succeed in their mission (to rescue the world of course) or fail.  Unlike say ""Enemy of the State"", which managed to grapple with the potential dangers of an over-computerized and mechanized society in a world with which we are all familiar, ""The Matrix"" takes us to a sci-fi world that never fully engages the audience in even its own reality.  Part of the problem may be that the film's visual designers settle for the conventional sci-fi view of the future world as a series of dark, cramped, fog enshrouded rooms and corridors familiar to us from countless such movies.  We follow the obviously well thought-out and meticulously explained storyline but find ourselves never particularly engaged in the characters or feel any stake in the outcome of the final resolution. As to the film's much vaunted special effects, they are, admittedly at times, intriguing, but since computer graphics now make even the most preposterous situations possible on the screen, the audience craves more than simply scattered moments of jawdropping visuals to engage its full attention.  ""The Matrix""  borders on dullness quite often during its overlong 136 minute running time.  Perhaps a movie that takes place in a world that really isn't a world needs a more engaging central character to make the audience care.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Terrible script + mediocre acting + great special effects = The Matrix.,"The Matrix is just another sci-fi film that offers nothing special to the genre.

The only person that even resembled an actor was Laurence Fishburne. Keanu Reeves is his usual self.All in all a pretty terrible movie and everyone's love for it made it even worse.If you are looking for a good sci-fi flick go out and get ""Planet of the Apes"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", or any one of the Star Wars films.

"""Ignorance is Bliss""","Ultra-stylish Techno-Noir classic that is broad on concept and design and creates a novel realm of realism vs cerebral creation.

This was the ride of the decade and brought a new look to the new millennium.It's not without some flaws and faults, mainly that the matrix is so complex and complicated that its own concept had to be ""bent and broken"" to allow for some of the story to translate to an acceptable theatrical experience. At least to its targeted mainstream audience. In the hands of a quirky and edgy Director it could have been done with more ""in house logic"", but then it would be quite a different experience.The whole concept of a Messiah and ""The One"" is kind of elementary in an extreme exploitation such as this but that only drops it a notch from the best of Sci-Fi and does nothing to hold this exhilarating experience back from being quite entertaining, if on a lesser level.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"I don't care what anybody says, this is nothing original.","When I first saw the Matrix a few years ago, I thought it was a pretty good flick, but as I watched it more and more, I began to realize that the film ripped off from a variety of films such as the computer-animated masterpiece Tron and the intelligent action film Face/Off to name a few. Now, most people think this film is intelligent, but I thought that is was incredibly long and was almost entirely plotless. It's a shame at how the characters act so serious that you don't know what they are talking about. Another problem I have with the Matrix were the incredibly overrated effects. First of all, I can't understand why the Matrix won the Visual Effects Oscar over the Phantom Menace, which took much more effort and used much more technology. I see so many unoriginalities with the Matrix's effects. People who think that the Bullet Time effects were original and told the story, you obviously haven't seen the slow-motion bullets in Face/Off, which I personally found more eye-catching. And for people who think that the story about a computer programmer entering a virtual reality world, you obviously haven't seen the Walt Disney masterpiece Tron, which, by the way, had far more groundbreaking technology for its day than the Matrix's effects had when it was first made.

Pretentious and overblown,"The Matrix is the first installment of a ""trilogy"" of sci-fi movies. In fact, it's not really a trilogy, in an organic sense, it's just a movie and its sequels.Anyway, ""The Matrix"" is a film with good premises, but bad developments. Although most of the ideas of the film were taken from sci-fi writers of the 60's and philosophers of the past (the idea that we exist as a thought, or a dream, goes back to Plato at least), the script did a good job in putting these ideas together in a modern plot (at least as for year 2000). The oniric influence of recent sci-fi comic books on the film is visible throughout and is what makes the visual appeal of the film.Unfortunately, what could have been a really good movie has been turned by the W. brothers into an average action flick targetted at 15 year-old boys, among which must belong the guys who wrote this flick is the ""best movie"" they've seen. There is almost no acting, and the heros wearing sunglasses all the time is a good way to avoid any sort of emotion to show on their faces. This total absence of emotion is one of the reasons why nobody gives a f..k whether or not everyone dies in the sequels.The W. brothers have a strong tendency to show off : heroes wearing sunglasses and Armani black leather coats designed for yuppies, trendy night-club population, ""bullet time"" special FX, (ugly) kung fu video game action, heavy metal and techno music during the whole film, etc. All this is supposed to make the film look ""kewwwwl"". In opposition to the heros, the agent Smith wears a dark working suit : he is not cool (although he also wears sunglasses, but that's because he is a spy agent).But what really turns me off is the pretense of the religioso-philosophico-technobabble which hardly hides the vacuity of the characters and the serious weaknesses of the script. There are so many other films which say much more with less, that this film looks highly overblown in comparison.I'm not even trying to elaborate on the sequels, which, instead of correcting these problems, show them in their full splendor.In a word, this flick is highly overrated. But hey, who cares ? The ""trilogy"" has ripped off enough spectators to make the Warner happy.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Are you the one ?,"If you are looking for the answer to this question then you are going to find it in the 1999 masterpiece from The Wachowski brothers which watching in 2019 still feels like it could have comed out last week and you wouldn't really notice it's a 20 year old movie. Everything still holds up and doesn't feel that it has aged too much both visualy and story wise.
I watched this movie last time in 2012 and remembered quite a lot of the story watching it again in 2019 but this time I paid more attention to everything.I want to talk about few aspects of the movie very brieflyThe story. ( Easy to watch, engaging, action packed about a regular guy whose life changes quite drasticly and the growth of becoming the one he never thought he could.
Sound design. (Excellent. When I watched all the fight,action scenes the special effects gave a satisfying feedback in my ears when someone landed a punch or got knocked out.)
Cinematography (Feels like they thought about everything and it has that special Matrix feel to everything.)
Characters (Most mémorable are Neo which needs no introduction and agent Smith which has a way to intimidate even the viewer and they both are just iconic legends.)Probably my favourite scenes were the lobby,the rooftop and all the fighting scenes against agent Smith where an underdog just tries anyway even knowing his chances of winning are slim.To conclude I would say people in the year 2070 could watch this and it would still hold up.

It's a movie that pushed boundaries and remains relevant even decades later.Set in a dystopian future where humanity unknowingly lives in a simulated reality controlled by machines, the film follows Neo (Keanu Reeves) as he learns the truth and fights to free humanity.It's inspiring, eye-opening, and makes you question many aspects of life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Painstaking work was put into actually dismantling that lobby and it paid off. Next, the production design of The Matrix builds a sleek world of green hues and leather jackets that still inspires aesthetics today. The dystopian future is appropriately bleak while the computer world is appropriately polished.Meanwhile, The Matrix has dynamic camerawork. Its use of the bullet time effect has become synonymous with the film and is even known as ""the Matrix effect"". The sound design is surreal and the music is borderline iconic. The story is philosophical and trippy. Lastly, the direction is wonderful because The Matrix has such a precise style. Its combination of eastern and western action, its slick fashion, and its futuristic visuals create an experience that cannot be replicated. Because The Matrix is jam-packed with so much excitement, flair, and abstraction, it is a generational experience.Writing: 9/10

G.O.A.T.,"The greatest film of all time, exceeded my expectations, a thrill ride from start to finish, seen the film 179 times, and I will watch the film 179 more times, I'm not a sci-fi kind of guy, but this is the first film that introduced me to the genre, the special effects still hold to up to this day, I can watch the film from the first frame, all the way til the very end of the credits, the music goes well with the film. If you plan on going to film school, I highly recommend watching this film for inspiration, filmmaking 101, I can't find any negative thing to say about this film, I can watch this film all day, every day, I tend to use dialogue from this film in everyday life....

Matrix is overrated!,"Matrix was a good movie for 1990 but comparing to new series on 2020 its just not 8.7.And
Glorified martial arts movie masquerading as a science-fiction thriller, this blockbuster hit struck a nerve with the public, though it isn't as brainy (or as deep) as one might be led to believe. Keanu Reeves is typically one-note as a computer-hacking loner who finds his life may not be reality--and that an alternate reality introduced to him by guru Laurence Fishburne could destroy him. Written and directed by the Wachowski brothers, who seem to enjoy a twisting story--though at the expense of logic (forget credibility). A more engaging leading man might have made the technical asides easier to wade through, although most audiences didn't seem to mind. Followed by ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""The Matrix Revolutions"", both in 2003.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Superb and revolutionary film,"The Matrix is a superb and revolutionary film that combines multiple genres and ideas to create something unique.

Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss are both incredible with effortlessly cool and stylish supporting performances. Hugo Weaving is a phenomenal villain who is effectively cold and calculating yet also full of rage.The Wachowski's direction is excellent, with director of photography Bill Pope they manage to create clean and comprehensible action scenes as well as some truly mind blowing moments.

"It´s is not just a Sci movie, is a study in philosophy","I think with almost 5.000 reviews, i dont have too many to add here. But i will try.First time i watched Matrix its was in 2000, ( i was 12 years old) and took me for the inovative action, i loved it!. In 2003 a lit bit older i rewatched as a study in a philosophy class. And that i just remarckble. After that day it opened my mind to many aspects in films and moviemaking. First for the movies itself ( the oracle and its messages, the pils, the Matrix itself and its meaning). And of course, .this broadened my vision of film interpretation, not just in the Matrix itself, but ignited my perception as whole and after that i become a lover of the seventh art,
In short, I liked Matrix Iwhen I was 12 years old, and I loved it when I was older and could really understand it (or thought I did). The perfect mix of sci-fi, philosophy, action, a perfect mix of cult and mainstream movie, a real masterpiece.For all the meaning that this movie has in my life i would say that its ( of course in my opinion) the best movie the human kind did.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"A ""Classic"" in the truest sense of the word","""What's he doing?""
""He's beginning to believe""When the Matrix first came out back in 1999 I was still in my babyhood. I never got the opportunity nor was it possible for me to see it on the big screen. I have always wondered what that experience might have brought. I'm sure the people who were lucky enough to witness it in the theatres, had their money's worth.The people who are still unaware, let me just say that the last half an hour is a blast. I can't stress this enough, but I freaking loved anything and everything about the final act. I have heard nothing but compliments about the action and how it revolutionized the whole genre; now I can truly understand why! It was incomparable, the experience was one of a kind.So it was, for the rest. It would be a crime If I dare to take anything away. What an amazing concept and what's more impressive is how they managed to weave a palpable narrative all around the same. Do remember, a great idea can only do so much on its own! You need to have a functional story, a considerable amount of technological backing and most of all a slew of unforgettable personalities who would work as these catalysts in your tale.The Matrix had 'em all, as simple as that. A ""Classic"" in the truest sense of the word!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A Groundbreaking Exploration of Reality and Perception,"""The Matrix,"" released in 1999, is a cinematic masterpiece that redefined the science fiction genre and left an indelible mark on popular culture. Directed by the Wachowskis, this film brilliantly blends philosophical questions with groundbreaking visual effects, creating an immersive experience that challenges viewers' perceptions of reality.The story follows Neo (Keanu Reeves), a hacker who discovers that the world he knows is an elaborate simulation created by machines to subdue humanity. As he joins a group of rebels led by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), Neo embarks on a journey to free the human race from this artificial prison.The film's visual effects, particularly the ""bullet time"" sequences, revolutionized action cinema and set new standards for what was possible in filmmaking. The iconic green-tinted digital world and the stark contrast between the simulated and real worlds are visually stunning and symbolically rich.""The Matrix"" is more than just an action-packed spectacle; it delves into profound themes such as free will, reality, and the nature of existence. Its philosophical underpinnings, inspired by thinkers like Descartes and Baudrillard, invite viewers to question the very fabric of their own lives.Keanu Reeves delivers a career-defining performance as Neo, perfectly capturing the character's transformation from a confused hacker to a confident savior. The supporting cast, including Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity and Hugo Weaving as the menacing Agent Smith, also shine in their respective roles.In conclusion, ""The Matrix"" is a thought-provoking and visually stunning film that continues to resonate with audiences two decades after its release. It is a timeless exploration of reality and perception, and a must-see for anyone who appreciates cinema that challenges the mind while dazzling the senses.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Amazing Movie Ever!!!,"The Matrix Is one of the best Classic Sci-Fi Action Film ever !It depicts a dystopia future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality called ""the Matrix"", created by sentient machines to subdue the human population, while their bodies' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source. Computer programmer ""Neo"" learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, which involves other people who have been freed from the ""dream world"".Written and directed by the Wachowski brothers, this classic sci-fi action film stars Keanu Reeves as a lowly computer programmer who discovers his entire existence, and that of all mankind, is nothing but a simulation in a computer. The reality within a reality is a concept that's done before... but never like this - The Matrix requires absolute attention from his audience, least you'll be completely lost in a few minutes. With the help of supporting cast members Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne-Moss, Reeves discovers that inside this simulation environment known as The Matrix, he can control, bend, and manipulate space-time... resulting in some of the most incredibly iconic images to ever grace the silver screen.The slow-motion ""bullet-time"" effects as they're known today were groundbreaking and revolutionary when we first saw them 12 years ago. Although Reeves is notorious for his inability to really convey much emotional range, his character here lends itself well to him as an actor. This is a movie that makes you think, makes you gasp, and makes totally forget where the 136-minutes went after finishing it. It's no wonder this film spawned two very successful sequels, and dozens of copy-cats. The Matrix, ""Visually revolutionary, and mind-blowing.""Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix. He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting.Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. He also played the roles in Underrated Daredevil (2003)and Bad Boys I & II. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job.The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor. Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopia atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Too many cultural references,"I was completely disappointed by this movie.I remember having to stop multiple times and double check if it was the right movie. I remember it coming out, I remember being unable to watch it. I remember all my friends giving me 'spoiler-free' reviews. No one could stop talking about this movie for way to long. I remember, almost instantly, becoming 'that guy who has not seen it yet', and I think that's part of the reason I didn't get around to watching it quickly.You can't survive to watch this movie without spoilers.The entire movie is built around a single concept, and that is a big reveal. It is also a huge pop-culture reference, so I almost want to hint at it, but it isn't the point. I wish I could have been in a theater when people hadn't seen this movie, or even considered the idea that drives this movie.It must have been quite a horrifying shock to experience Neo's story without spoilers.I can think of dozens of pop culture jokes/references to the matrix. None of them do anything to help build or maintain the shock of the original reveal. Rather they just turn in into an odd kinda joke. I really wish I could go back to the theaters and experience that gasp that must have gone through the theater on opening night.I wish I had been as blown away as all those people who experienced it the first time.All I though was, 'Huh.'

I hate this film,"With its trite Kafka-wannabe subtext and pretensions to profundity, this badly acted (Reeves is like a lump of wood, with a permanently perplexed look on his dumb face), poorly scripted, mess of a movie had me yawning and, at times, bristling with irritation. The stupid, faux philosophy about different realities was clearly ripped from a film called Dark City, which was far more chilling and unhinged, and managed to steer clear of the juvenile philosophical clap-trap that infected The Matrix (even the title is lame).Its only saving grace was some innovatory and influential action sequences and a good Don Davis score.But the action eventually seemed to contrive to divert the viewer from the paucity of original ideas exhibited, and culminated in a ridiculous, Dodge City-style shoot 'em up that had me laughing out loud. Then Neo turns into Superman: yep,s-o-o-o original. Then there's the bit where Neo is resurrected by the kiss by Trinity. It's ET and Snow White and every other now-predictable cliché in the cannon of story telling. To top that Fishburne's character whispers in hushed awe: ""He's The One"". I would have laughed if it wasn't so pathetic.In another comment someone described this and the sci-fi benchmark for all others to follow. Excuse me?!

A timeless masterpiece.,"The Matrix is, without a doubt, my favorite movie ever. I've watched it countless times, and every time, it feels just as fresh and exciting as the first. I gave it a 10/10 because it's not only a thrilling action-packed experience but also a thought-provoking journey that changed how I look at the world. The moment Neo takes the red pill and enters the real world is one of those cinematic moments that stays with you forever. It made me question the very nature of reality-an idea that still fascinates me today.The action scenes in The Matrix are legendary, and the groundbreaking ""bullet time"" effect blew my mind the first time I saw it. The fight choreography is stunningly fluid, and every punch, every kick, feels like part of a larger narrative about freedom, self-discovery, and the human spirit. But it's not just the action that draws me in-it's how the film uses these moments to explore deeper philosophical questions about reality, free will, and identity. The world-building is incredible, and the mix of sci-fi, cyberpunk aesthetics, and philosophy creates something timeless.Keanu Reeves gives one of his best performances as Neo, playing the confused hacker turned reluctant hero with sincerity and depth. Laurence Fishburne's Morpheus is wise and compelling, and Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity brings a perfect balance of strength and vulnerability. Their chemistry feels real, making the characters' struggles and victories even more impactful.Every time I watch The Matrix, I discover something new. The movie's layers of meaning and intricate details keep me coming back for more, and each viewing seems to add another level of appreciation for its complex narrative. What really sets this movie apart, though, is its ability to entertain while challenging viewers to think deeply about the world around them. It's not just a movie I love-it's one that has had a lasting impact on my perspective.The Matrix is more than just a sci-fi action film-it's an experience that reshapes your understanding of reality. Even after all these years, it remains a timeless masterpiece, and without a doubt, it will always be my number one film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Cyber-action-film noir-satiric-thriller is hyper-cool, great fun","The Wachowski Brothers enjoy action movies, but like the rest of us, realized that most of those made by Hollywood in the last dozen years or so have been basically mindless, however entertaining they are in other ways.So they wrote THE MATRIX -- actually, before they wrote BOUND -- and had a hard time selling it.  No wonder.  It's furiously intelligent, very serious but with an undertone of dark comedy that makes it different from all other action movies.  While clearly influenced by movies like BLADE RUNNER and ALIEN/ALIENS, they've also clearly been jazzed by comic books, cyber-science fiction of the William Gibson school, Hong Kong action movies and Japanese anime, as well as classic Hollywood films noir.But while they're clearly influenced by this heady stew, they've stirred into something fresh and original, and provided a back story so rich that dozens of other stories could be set in this same universe without ever getting around to actually doing a sequel to THIS story.Keanu-bashers will be deeply disappointed, because Reeves is terrific here, as is the rest of the cast, including the ultra-cool Laurence Fishburne.  But the standout performance comes from Hugo Weaving as the head bad guy; it's hard to believe he played the leading role in THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The normal reaction should be: Turn that computer off, take a vacation, maybe seek professional help. You can also make a movie...Matrix is not boring, it`s tense and it has stunning visuals. But like a good video clip does not make the music worth listening to, a whole bunch of special effects do not make a great movie.After watching the Matrix I recognized that:1. I don't get why super-robots, who overwhelmed the whole human kind, are not able to build some nuclear power plants, despite the fact that they really needn't care about radioactive pollution. Instead they get their energy from humans, and if you take a look at their body ""farms""  you must agree that it looks like they are putting a lot more energy into it than they get out of it... A good movie (even if it's science fiction) should provide some ground level logic in its story.2. I did not care about the characters. They die? Hmmm, okay. Trinity loves Neo? Uh, why is that? Did I miss something? A good movie makes me feel for the characters and understand their reactions. In this point Matrix is a total failure. Ever watched Brazil?

However, if there's 1 film that stands above them all, it's The Matrix - my favorite film of all time. I think I had already seen it 5 times, and for my 6th time, I finally saw it in a movie theater. The film really shows that no matter what kind of world we live in, we can make our own choices. Some of them may be good or bad, but there's still that freedom of thought...which can be freedom of action - or in my case, the freedom of telling people that The Matrix is my favorite film of all time even when flaws are pointed out. Pretty much every film I've seen has flaws like ""why can't they suddenly do that thing?"" or ""why is this subplot randomly added?""

Could this possibly have been any better?,"I base this on the Ultimate 10-Disc Set. An entire decade after this came out, it still holds up incredibly well. It simply has so much to offer... all that food for thought, different beliefs, tons of themes that are explored and such immense room for interpretation, with very little in this being certain or definite. The plot is excellent, develops well, and combines various interesting ideas(and no, they weren't original, they weren't meant to be... this puts a lot of fascinating concepts together, and presents them all for the mainstream audience). Granted, it spawned a ton of suddenly enlightened pocket philosophers with little doubt as to their own prowess, but with anything this influential, there are going to be some negative results. The pacing is spot-on, not a moment of this is too long or overly short. The action is astounding, exciting, fun, entertaining and awesome, and they manage to do amazing and memorable sequences. No, perhaps it does not dodge all of the clichés. The slow-motion(and bits clearly inspired by John Woo) and other tools appeared before this, yes, the point isn't that they were new... it's the way this uses them, and creates a unique style. Mixing Noir, Animé and countless allusions, and doing so with expert-like skill is an impressive feat. The Bullet-Time was invented for this, and it is fantastic. The martial arts, the choreography, the moves, magnificent. The effects are stunning and seamless, to this day. The cinematography and editing are perfect, and enormously well-planned. The mood and atmosphere is masterfully achieved. The acting is quite good, Reeves fits, Moss and Fishburne are marvelous, and Weaving is utterly impeccable. The dialog is almost completely invariably well-written, and well-delivered. There is no nudity or sexuality, at most hints thereof. There is language, moderately harsh, albeit not too bad in frequency. The DVD holds a text introduction(to the following) by the Wachowski's, that makes for a great read, as well as two commentary tracks, one of philosophers who enjoyed the film, Dr. Cornel West & Ken Wilder, and one of critics who did not care for it, Todd McCarthy, John Powers & David Thompson. These are worth listening to. I recommend this to any fan of science fiction, and anyone who wishes to be encouraged to think by what they watch. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Technological breakthrough film, a film prodigy","(As an avid film critic and reviewer, I got the chance to see this film among other critics and lucky people in late Feburary.).Andy and Larry Wachowski have done it again. With their chilling, dark film ""Bound"", which they directed and written, I knew I was going to expect another fantastic presentation. ""The Matrix"" completely blew me away.I got the announcement about this film over three years ago, and I was curious to see what ""The Matrix"" really was, but information was far too limited, leaving me only the names of the people behind the magic. However, it creeped up through the neighborhood and slapped me in the face, yelling, ""Damnit! Look at me!"" Look at it I did, and I am stilling pondering about ""The Matrix.""""The Matrix"" stars Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburn, Carrie-Ann Moss, and Joe Pantoliano, among others. I have tracked Fishburn's acting career since his infamous role on ""Pee Wee's Playhouse"" as ""Cowboy Curtis,"" and I must say, I am amazed once again. Fishburn with the rest of the actors/actresses perform stunningly, and leave you wanting more.But what is this Matrix I keep rambling on about? Well, as Fishburn states, ""Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself."" That is exactly what you need to do to decipher ""The Matrix.""Although I promised myself not to let out too much information on this film, I have permitted myself to blabber on about what this film has done. It has done far past my expectations in technology. The slick movements by the characters, and the martial arts are amazing. Obviously, a lot of work has been put into this film, and work has done it good.Another point about this film that may be brought to your surprise. The actual fight scenes, twirling about, action scenes, and so on, were conducted by the actors themselves, not stuntmen, which also adds another nice touch to realism. The training that the actors must have gone through has to be appreciated from this film.Now, after viewing this film, you may decide, ""Oh jeez. I thought I was in for something. This is just another Hollywood show-off of an old, repetitive storyline."" Well, may-be, but ""The Matrix"" has an insightful and nice touch to its storyline. It brings it out in a unique way that no film has brought before. That is why it stands out.""The Matrix"" is a marvel among movies. This may not get an Oscar or two, but it definitely stands out among other films. ""The Matrix"" cannot be explained unless seen, so for you to discover the mystery behind ""The Matrix"", you have to see it, to believe it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A Bit Confusing But A Big F/X Treat,"Special-effects were the drawing card when this came out at the end of the 20th century, and those effects were spectacular. They lived up to their billing.Unfortunately, the story was a bit confusing for much of the two hours, a bit too secular-minded for me, although others have viewed this with Biblical analogies. I do think the script could have used some humor here and there. It took itself a little too seriously. That was especially true for the four main characters.Nonetheless, because of the stylish visuals and effects, it entertained. I liked the monotone-speaking Hugo Weaver the best, or at least found him the most interesting. Lawrence Fishburne's character came in a close second in that regard.Once again here's a movie that made you glad VHS tapes were being phased out in favor of sharper, widescreen transfers.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A wild sci-fi classic.,"After seeing this movie it changed the way i will look at sci-fi movies for the rest of my life. This film was taken straight from the imagination of the Wachowski. The amazing special effects drove this film along with great sound editing and dialog. Just in case you don't know i will tell you the main plot of the movie. Neo is just an average guy who ends up being hunted by Agent Smith. HE ends up being one of the crew members with Morpheus and Trinity. Morpheus thinks that Neo is ""The One"" which means that this person would be very strong and can dodge bullets and do wild stuff like that.The reason so many people loved this movie was because it was so out of this world and no one else not even Mr.Spielberg could have done this movie because only two brothers could have brought this to life and made one of the best sci-fi sagas ever made(tied with the ""Alien"" saga) and make remembered through generations, so i hope when i get old this movie will still be remembered because it is simply amazing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Matrix aka stupidity.,"This movie provides the opportunity for people who aren't able to understand a film of actual quality to have something to say. It has come to be a sort of common understanding that Matrix contains some philosophical truth or even reasoning. However, this is not the case. The theme of this movie is extremely unoriginal and it's attempts to discuss philosophy is a blunt self-blow.But, this movie is suitable for people who feel ashame of the fact that they are incapable of understanding more complicated films. Therefore it has come to be a consent between viewers of lower intellectual ability to evoke this film as soon as philosophy is mentioned.It is plainly speaking a film for people who doesn't like films in particular but needs something to cling on in conversations about film.Quite pathetic really.

Highly overrated film,The Matrix is one of the most overrated films that I can think of. The film does have good action and some of the most amazing special effects ever put on a film. But the film is also drawn out and confusing. Keanu Reeves is the only one who could play a chacrter as flat as Neo and the rest of the cast expect for Laurence Fishburne and Joe Panotilano all give paper thin performances.

Matrix Tricks,"*Deeply exhales* The movie MATRIX was indeed a breaking point for movie makers, and it paved way for both marketers, producers, and film makers generally. The era at the time the MATRIX was released really needed something new and different, and this was what the MATRIX was able to deliver. With ground breaking still motions and effects, it was indeed a movie of the time. While being perfectly casted with Keanu Reeves playing NEO, and Carrie-Anne Moss playing Trinity, while leaving the boss himself in the middle of it all, Laurence Fishburne playing Morpheus.

Keanu Reeves in Wonderland,"Insomniac computer hacker Keanu Reeves (as Thomas ""Neo"" Anderson ) lives a common and interesting life. Hugo Weaving (as Agent Smith) tells him, ""You've been living two lives. In one life, you're Thomas A. Anderson, program writer for a respectable software company. You have a social security number, pay your taxes, and you help your landlady carry out her garbage. The other life is lived in computers, where you go by the hacker alias 'Neo' and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for. One of these lives has a future, and one of them does not."" That's a good description.Everything changes for Mr. Reeves when he is contacted by the intriguingly prophetic Laurence Fishburne (as Morpheus), through seemingly supernatural leather lass Carrie-Anne Moss (as Trinity). Mr. Fishburne believes Reeves just may be ""The One"". Mr. Weaving captures Reeves, and tells him Fishburne is the most dangerous man alive. Reeves instinctively distrusts Weaving and, with Ms. Moss' assistance escapes from him.

Even better as an adult!,"This movie was always epic watching it as a kid. The fight scenes, with cool bullet dodging, guns , helicopters, all the martial arts, it was all so exciting, apart from two scenes that always freaked me out. Neo's mouth going missing and when Neo gets the bugs in and out of his stomach, plus I might add the baby scene too, when Neo is born again. But other than that it was just a cool movie with cool clothes.But boy was it even better to watch it as an adult. The complexity and symbolism throughout every scene is so detailed. It's almost as if every line is deeply thought out and chosen. Concepts that were way too hard as a kid like the connection of the ship being called Nebuchadnezar, being connected with dreams and reality. Or the white rabbit and Alice in Wonderland references. Each of these tip offs were sp exciting, especially what occurs in Neos interactions with the people coming to his door. How did I miss the lines of them saying wake up. Neo spends the first half of the movie asking so many questions. It was also great to see how times have changed from 1999 technology and the phones used in the office scenes.The acting and casting is superb in this movie. I love every character. Hugo Weaving, Keanu Reeves especially display one of the best faces off battles of good versus bad that I've scene. And that gun scene in the foyer has the be thee most insane shoot out fighting scene in movie history. The fighting is so impressive. All credit to the effort the movie makers and cast put into pulling this off with excellence!The costumes and colour design is also well thought out with the green that matches the Matrix reality.This .movie is so good.

For me it was a very original film, nice fights (although the effects were not all that) and just average interpretations from the cast with the exception of the always effective Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith) and little more.I would not recommend it to those who do not have an open mind for fantasy and Sci-fi.Hope this was useful!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Laughably Awful,"The good: The action scenes involving guns are original. The ""frozen moment"" camera effect is well done.The bad: The script is uneven and horribly horribly written. I mean Saturday morning cartoons are better written than this, not even good cartoons either, I think that the average episode of Voltron or Scooby Doo have more meaningful and profound scripts. The main characters can't even manage to be two dimensional.The ugly: The acting is hideous, and I'm not just talking about the spoken lines. I can almost hear Keanu saying ""dude"" after every line. Fishburne is also attains a whole new level of corniness, Mumra on Thundercats levels of melodrama. As in another over-hyped movie, Crouching Tiger etc. etc., no amount of special effects can disguise the fact that these people do not know martial arts. The fight scene between Fishburne and Reeves made me laugh out loud, and not in a happy way, more of a ""I can't believe how pathetic this is"" kind of defensive laugh. Hong Kong movies made in the late seventies have better wirework. The cookie cutter villain is actually the most compelling character, and that my friends is sad.This is what really makes me nauseous: Two more movies are coming out. Umm... did I miss something here? I thought that the movie's only redeeming quality was the ""surprise"" midway through when we found out what ""The Matrix"" was. There's not much sequel material here to work with.The first half of this movie is decent in that it doesn't really insult the viewer. As soon as Reeves wakes up in the tank, the movie becomes a laughable, pretentious Saturday morning cartoon. Junior high kids should eat it up, but any reasonably intelligent person who has read a book in his or her life will take absolutely nothing from this move of any lasting value.

An amazing idea with amazing execution,"The matrix is a dystopian science fiction film with a plot that questions reality, and that's about all I can say without spoilers. The film is instantly engaging and when you reach the ultimate plot twist you will be on the edge of your seat. Not only is the idea of the film incredible but it is brought to life flawlessly. The film, which is directed by the Wachowskis, is stunning to watch, the visuals definitely add to the dystopian tone of the film. Almost every shot has some kind of reflection, depth, or color contrast to make the science fiction even cooler. The film editing is also incredible and makes every action sequence amazing to watch. The visual effects are also amazing, especially for 1999. This is a must-see sci-fi film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Challenging Reality,"The Matrix took us all to a place in our minds that questioned everything! We have all, at some point, had that question in our minds, ""Is this really happening?"" We have questioned reality during the worst of times, we have felt like the moment is unreal during the best of times, but after watching The Matrix, people started to question every moment in their lives.And even more so, the question of whether if given the choice we would continue to leave this possibly fake reality, and wake in our true reality, we would actually take that pill...Not really something that can be taken lightly.The cast was an top form, each bringing a level of emotion fit for the character, standing out from the crowd was Laurence Fishburne, who's energy when addressing the crowds was hair-raising, his belief in Neo was inspiring, he made people take a good look at what it meant to have true conviction.This film broke all the rules, it bent reality and it made us appreciate the little things in life a whole lot more, I don't know what the next step in film is, but if it's as mind blowing as The Matrix, it's going to be epic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

An iconic masterpiece,"The Matrix came out in 1999 for almost 23 years ago, but the vfx is still pretty good, the movie wasn't supposed to be the biggest thing but still looked nice. It has this unique green tint that some may say looks bad, but that makes the movie look unique compared to other movies. If you have watched the 4th installment witch came out X-mas 2021, you can see that the tint is gone and it don't look like a matrix film, even do it was created 22 years after the 1st one, it looks out of place, so the tint is a great thing.The music, is great and has this sci-fi theme mixed with great action music witch brings back memories of Terminator 2. The music works great with the great performances of all the actors & the well choreographed fights. There are some nice action scenes and then towards the end it's all action. There is so much variation in the fights aswell, it isn't just a small area the characters fight for a long time, but the last almost hour of the film is just one big pile of action that still has variation whiles being fluent.The story and concept is also pretty interesting and the movie and the whole franchise really shows the concept in an deep way.Another great thing is the characters that all get love, the antagonist is also awesome, agent smith is a great villain even do you only see him in a black suit with glasses most of the time, at least the suit always stays on. The movie also manages to have little to no boring scenes, many movies have to explain something's and most movies like to balance the explaining throughout the experience, some movies no matter how good have some of those boring scenes that are necessary and understandable to have in the film if the audience is going to understand the story being told. The scenes that have som explaining still feel good, you might feel a tiny bit bored but it just gets more and more exiting and you don't feel bored at all, it's kinda hard to explain with words.At the end of the day, an iconic sci-if movie with great everything and also if you made it this far I hope you have a great day and:Unfortunately, no one can be told what The Matrix is.

Life in reality,"What made The Matrix special was the groundbreaking visual effects such as 'Bullet Time' that have been often imitated in other films and video games. The Wachowski's simply knocked it out of the park when it came to the visuals.Keanu Reeves is Mr Anderson an ordinary computer programmer by day and secret hacker called Neo at night who is suddenly pursued by government agents led by a sinister Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) after he is contacted by computer hacker Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne.)Morpheus believes Neo is the 'One.' Humans lives in a false reality that controls humans and Neo will lead the harvested humans to rebel against the machines creating the false reality.The film mixes cyberpunk science fiction with Hong Kong style martial arts and elements of Japanese manga type animation as inspiration.Keanu Reeves is in his element in a world where he does not understand what is around him. He looks cool and does well in the martial arts sequences. I guess revisiting this genre made up for the failure of Johnny Mnemonic.Laurence Fishburne is even more cooler as Morpheus guiding Neo in this hostile new reality and how to take down the system. Carrie-Anne Moss is kick ass sexy in black leather as Trinity who displays superhuman powers.The film has philosophical underpinnings as the Wachowski's ask us to think about the world around us and our place within it.The subtext of the film can be re-analysed in light of the personal journeys of the Wachowskis. Change and transformation. It is laughable to see the right wing attempting to co-opt the movie for their own agenda.The film is cool, it is hip but I felt slightly too long and little bit too po faced. However the Wachowskis did manage to catch lightning in a bottle which they did not manage to do with the following two sequels.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
This movie took the Blue Pill,"I have heard so much about the Matrix and finally watched it for the first time this weekend.Boy, were there lots of action sequences. Lots and lots and lots of action sequences. You can feel the filmmakers just trying to top the last sequence instead of doing something like advancing the plot or developing the characters. Unless you think the action sequence is the be-all-and-end-all of movies, all that action just gets boring after a while. I have nothing against whiz-bang special effects as long as they do something worthwhile to move the film along (the Lord of the Rings films are good at this). But this is just not happening with the Matrix.The Matrix concept itself is thought-provoking. Why isn't it developed more? The fact that this monumental struggle for the soul of humanity ends up with a shoot-out, a helicopter-dangling rescue sequence and a martial arts fight is almost laughable. It's like saying the mysteries of the universe can be unraveled by watching beer commercials. If you want to see an ending that leaves you with something worth chewing on, you'll be sadly disappointed (as I was).As for other elements of the movie -- Keanu Reeves, as much as I usually enjoy watching him, was extremely wooden. Fishburne and Moss were good at what they did, but their parts were pretty two-dimensional. I couldn't get emotionally involved with any of the characters, which is ultimately the fault of the writers. The cinematography and ""style"" of the film and the sets is pretty cool to look at. However, the whole black clothes and sunglasses motif is just a little bit hokey after a while. And the agents -- I swear they look just like the bad aliens in Brother From Another Planet -- I kept expecting them to shriek at each other.I look at it this way - people who think that sitting in front of their tubes and playing video games is a worthwhile way to spend their lives will probably love this movie. People who want something more will think it's pretty hollow. It's a shame because the concept had a lot of potential, but the filmmakers took the easy way out.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The most intelligent science fiction blockbuster in ...,"... I don't know how long.  Probably that's why it didn't do as well as big, dumb, lumbering things like ""Independence Day"" and ""The Phantom Menace"", and a dozen or so films I didn't bother to watch.Much of what you will have heard about this film is false.  You will have heard that the premise is that we're all prisoners in a virtual reality world; but the premise is not that WE are prisoners in a virtual reality world - it's a good deal more interesting than that.  You will have heard that it's hip and cynical; but thankfully, it's neither.  You will have heard the word ""cyberpunk"" being used, with the odd allusion to films like ""The Ghost in the Shell"" and ""Blade Runner""; but it's NOT pretentious, deep-breathing, tawdry angst of that kind at all.  It's really quite charming once you get to know it.  Beneath all the up-to-the-minute computer gimcracks lies a gentle and trusting heart.The central character is played by Keanu Reeves, and I retract my claim that there's no use for the man.  Indeed he acts rather well.  Admittedly he plays a character who spends most of the film, and indeed most of his life, with the air of someone who (in the words of another character) isn't worried because he expects to wake up soon; but being able to do this well is being able to do something well.  Besides, we spend the opening half being at least half as bewildered as he is - even if we've read the plot synopsis.  When the set-up is revealed in all its glory I admit that one or two details are a bit far fetched.  But I never felt that my intelligence was insulted in the way things had been revealed to me.Special effects are marvellous.  I don't think I've ever seen computer-generated images look this convincing - usually they disfigure a movie - and there are several reasons why they work so well.  A dark (but attractively dark) style of lighting shows them at their best. Psychological tricks - well-chosen camera angles, misdirection - are used to make us believe in what we see: no-one makes the assumption that George Lucas made in ""The Phantom Menace"", that software alone will do the trick. And more to the point, a story has been chosen where the kind of technology favoured by Hollywood these days is not out of place.  The air of vague phoniness that computer effects impart, the sense that something is deeply wrong, is exactly what we want in a story where something really IS deeply wrong.Only two things let the film down: the last couple of minutes (and after two fantastic hours I can forgive a little fumble at the end), and a HORRIBLY synthetic musical score, which seems to be there only to make us glad when it stops.  Luckily it stops often enough and it only succeeds in ruining one or two scenes.  I don't know - maybe this kind of musical pollution has been around for a while, and I only noticed it now because ""The Matrix"", unlike the brainless action movies surrounding us on all sides, deserves better.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

HELL YEAH!!!,"Finally a science fiction film that cannot be immediately dismissed as either unreal or impossible. How can anyone say that this isn't exactly the way that reality is? To try and disprove this view of reality would be like trying to disprove the existence of God. Maybe he's there, maybe he isn't, but no one can possibly prove it either way. It works the same way for The Matrix. It is possible that everything that we see is fed into our minds by machines and that we would never know it.Probably the only remotely convincing argument the other way would be that if that were true, why would the machines give us a movie like this to watch? It would expose them! But then again, maybe they just want to get us thinking, maybe to see how we'll react to the possibility of their existence. Maybe they are getting ready to present themselves to us. Robot rapture! Who can say that the Wachowski brothers are not messengers?This is by far the best science fiction film that I have ever seen. Aside from the relatively plausible story, every other element of the film was spectacular! The special effects (which, in my opinion, usually take more away from a film than they add) were awesome, the fight scenes were incredibly intense, and the pace of the film itself was breathtaking. Every hole is covered up brilliantly, even down to a definition of deja-vu and a possible reason for why so many different foods taste like chicken. These little ties to reality are one of the best ways that this film was able to come off so realistically.The Matrix is absolutely not to be missed. Even people who don't like science fiction or even action films will more than likely enjoy this film. It is well presented, it is not unnecessarily excessive, and it presents the most innovative camera work in years. It has something for everyone, and will become a science fiction classic without a doubt.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
More holes than a hunk o'swiss,"I didn't dislike this movie.That said, I just have a few problems with it. I'll start with the cast. Where in the world did they find actors so badly on par with Keanu Reeves? Amongst the 'pretty boy' actors in Hollywood, he is the prince of the wood face. Clint Eastwood may have more expression. All of the actors, with the possible exception of Larry Fishburn, who I have seen in other roles that were good, are as stiff as a corpse. None of Neo's pals need to be in this film. They are totally uninteresting and unnecessary. Apoc? Switch? Mouse? Why? These people have the personalities of a smock. At least the two brothers serve the purpose of getting them in and out of the Matrix and driving the ship. The others are there to look good, and they missed on that too.And why so much needless violence? All these 'cops' they kill are just people suppossedly stuck in that gooey jell you get out of the 25 cent vending machines, right? So, Neo and his babe go around and kill a bunch of helpless, innocent people. Those guys were just minding their own biz when they burst in with an arsenal that rivals that of Rick James's.And then there are the scary characters. They range from the emotionless 'smiths' to that of those creepy kids who bent spoons and made me wax sentimental about unicef for some reason. In fact, the Smiths were the best 'acted' roles, but I think that's because they had the least to stretch since they were the bad guys.I can't even get into the plot holes, since there is a word limit, but there were a lot. This whole movie is beyond improbable. But, it's worth a viewing or 2. Check it out if you got a friend who wants to blow there money one saturday night.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"This really, really sucks.","Anyone with half of a brain could see right through this mainstream Hollywood garbage.The effects are not ""spectacular"" (they are loud, annoying, and overblown) the acting isn't ""great"" (It sucks).It's kind of like Bill & Ted's Adventures Through an Alternate Reality.Most of the ""serious dramatic scenes"" were laughable.

"layered, textured, somewhat intelligent future of sci fi","i love this movie for the manny many themes that come up repeatedly. The story's arch is quite good in that it doesn't feel as though much of anything else could be added. The central philosophy is admirably brought to a movie that a mainstream audience can digest, along with metaphorical and allegorical strains of the bible, alice in wonderland, drug use, the life cycle, cartesian dualism, buddhist one consciousness, giger style enemies, artificial intelligence, newtonian physics, orwellian nightmares, and euclidean view of the world as a series of numbers and probabilities. Sci fi need not be the same old, evil monster chase humans without rhyme or reason. The movie dooes sidestep charecter development by making it's charecters not know who they are, and also by killing most of them off as soon as they are met. while this isn't the arty pretentious greatness of citizen kane or waking life, it is a movie that is likely to be long remembered and worshipped like Star Wars",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A Movie with Different Layers,"Like ""Blade Runner"", the ""Matrix"" trilogy has at least two different levels of story. Both are evident, but we, at first, only see the first and less important, which is the Matrix itself and the man-against-machine war. The second level, which is the central plot of the whole thing, is so obvious that it becomes invisible.If you liked this movie more than the sequel, ""Matrix: Reloaded"", then you, like almost everyone else, didn't understand it. If you are feeling bad about that, don't worry, it took me almost eight years to finally understand it, too! Many people liked this first part, the rest hated it, and both didn't understand it. Interestingly enough, the ones that hated it were closer to understanding it than those that liked it. People that didn't like the ""Matrix"" trilogy always talk about the ""shallow story"" and the ""cheap philosophy"". As much as they are right about the cheap philosophy, they are complete and absolutely wrong about the shallow story. The ""pseudo-philosophic junk"" is, actually, junk, but a very important part of the story, and that is so clear in this first part of the trilogy that no one actually realized it. It happens because, taken alone, ""The Matrix"" is just a fantasy movie, placed some time in the future.The key to realize the greatness of the ""Matrix"" trilogy is accepting that it is a science fiction, not a fantasy movie. With that in mind, you can find the real villain of the trilogy, then everything will make sense, including the things that make no sense at all in a science fiction movie, like Neo's skills, both inside and outside the Matrix. The really interesting thing is that the villain openly shows its evilness in ""Reloaded"", it even explains its reason to do the things it does, but we promptly forgive or forget it! And pay a lot of attention to the dialogs at the very ending, in ""Matrix: Revolutions"", don't be deceived or misled by the background, because they present the final results of the main struggle of the trilogy and you will realize who is the winner.So, follow the white rabbit and find out who is the real villain in the ""Matrix"" trilogy. After that, you will see that almost all speeches in it have two completely different meanings, one that supports a weak futuristic cloak-and-dagger flick, with lots of ""cool"", but unimportant Greek-and-whatever references, and another that leads to a much darker reality, which will make you love the whole trilogy, or more properly, the trilogy as a whole, not only this first installment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
My favorite movie ever.,"This remains my number one favorite movie of all time. The 2nd one was alright. 3rd one nearly made me cry, what a horrible way to end this series.

That scene where Neo does the crazy bend back to dodge the bullets thing was purely amazing. Very unique storyline what with turning humans to batteries. That was just brilliant.

The battle scenes and the unforgettable gun fights, and lets not forget the memorable and very recognizable scene with the slowdowns and Trinity doing that poise.

the architecture of cognition,"'The Matrix' must be one of the most ambitious and highly successful projects of the past twenty years. Its difficult to imagine how this film could have gone from conception to execution, and succeeded with such flying colors. For a long time I've avoided writing a review because this was my ""Godfather"" or ""Star Wars"" movie, having first seen it at 13 and instantly falling in love with it. I could never be truly objective about this movie, nor could I find a single truthful, objective analysis of it anywhere on IMDb or RT. Roger Ebert's review was nice, but too harsh.'Bound' helped me appreciate better how 'Matrix' was conceived. Neither of these two films has a single wasted moment. It seems that the Wachowskis build a film by cascading a set of scenes, like a series of dominos, so that each scene projects into the next one. This is of course what all screenwriters do, but as simple as it sounds, it is no mean feat. The most important part of any film, I think, is how you connect scenes, how you work on transitions so as to create meaning and plausibility. What you show, how you show, and most importantly, what you Don't show. This is extremely difficult. It requires a deep understanding of the cognitive mechanics at work between a film and a viewer. It is, if you like, the most important part of film-making, as important (if not more) than the actual shooting process.The brothers nailed this whole conception business down to the last detail. The editor won an Oscar, but the film was streamlined by the directors for perfect editing. The cinematography and sound design is breathtaking. Joel Silver brought another influence to bear in terms of production expertise. They worked on the formidable design and effects requirements, even bringing in a legendary Hong Kong action choreographer for the martial arts scenes.And then they made casting choices that could not have been better. This film rests on the visual and vocal libido of the leads. It works only because the actors work, because we relate and identify with them. Just watch Weaving and Fishburne scorch the frame in their respective parts; these are their best roles. Moss is visually apt. Reeves is unwittingly perfect for his role, more perfect than anyone could have imagined.Another important part of this film is the self-reference. This film riffs on itself many times in many ways, such as when Mouse asks Neo how the machines could possibly know about the taste of Tasty Wheat. This is essentially winking at the viewer by momentarily snapping the plausibility of the whole idea. Also, this whole franchise is one big stab at the Terminator movies and their enduring popularity. Instead of time travel, we have virtual reality. Instead of terminators, we have agents. Instead of John Connor....None of this explains how they came up with this concept. The keystone of the arch is hidden. There are countless other 'influences' here : Phil Dick, William Gibson, Doctor Who, Grant Morrisson's 'The Invisibles' etc. And as with Tarantino, we are unable to say for sure whether it is homage or plagiarism. The innovation lies in the architecture of the whole thing, in the layering, in the flawless integration of so many different design elements to form a seamless, coherent entity. The Matrix is everywhere indeed.This is the only way to make movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A cyber-flick owing an equal debt to Blade Runner and Lewis Carroll, The Matrix collapses under the weight of an idiotic and mind-numbing New Testament-like structure that finds surrogates for Christ, Judas, etc.  Joe Pantoliano, so thoroughly excellent in the Wachowski's previous outing Bound, is helpless and hapless playing the underwritten Cypher, but Hugo Weaving easily gives the worst performance of his career as a strictly one-note, wooden bad guy in the grand tradition of one-note, wooden bad guys.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A great looking film that has less substance than the expectation.,"A great looking film that has less substance than the expectation.It's a movie that looks great and even the premise is outstanding but is made comical i action ruining the point to an extent. Surely, when I saw it in theaters when I was very young I loved it and went gaga and saw the whole trilogy in theaters and liked t to an extent But now, when I revisited it after several years, the 'wow' factor has gone and now it seems like any other action film.Surely, in terms of action and the whole production design, this was the first of it's kind that had the greenish tinge to frames and setting up infinite space in a room, in that complete white background scene where ""Neo"" and Morpheus talk.Keanu Reeves as Neo/Thomas Anderson was good ad so was Carrie Ann Moss as Trinity but I loved Morpheus played y Laurence Fishburne the most as his character was the epitome of setting men free from bondage and in his own way.The writer-directors Wachowskis must be appreciated and credited a lot for having taken the Hollywood action sequences to a new level. Be it the ""Bullet movement"" or the ""walking on the walls"" they were stunningly and with an ease.We know, that none of it is possible, this is a science fantasy film that takes the premise from the myths of ""being free from world"". It takes from the Buddhism concept of ""Nirvana"" I think that means liberation of the soul. Yet, we are engaged in a way much better than many sci-fi films that this makes us believe in the theory at least.I might not like this whole picture being seen again, but I am going with a 3/5 that means the film is surely good.

My opinion will have you thinking about the Matrix,"I just came to realize that I have not rated this classic since I saw it 20+ years ago, which is a good thing, as I changed my mind on two major aspects, that you will not hear easily:
1. It's a rip-off of Dark City. There are plenty of videos showing how the Wachowski bro.. I mean sisters ripped off not just the story, but even scenes and went as far as to use the same studio settings even, like the rooftop scene. This alone should make people think about the ""originality"" of the movie, but for the sakes of argument let's leave that at rest. Shame on the Wachowskis, in hindsight
2. More importantly: their ideological ""genius"". Since it's 2024 and the makers decided to make it quite obvious that their view on life goes beyond the ordinary, to the point of their existence and perception of their own reality therein resulting in their operations, I no longer see unintentional phantasy behind it, but a deep rooted ideology. Which was perhaps there from the start, the main reason for my review now.Let me elaborate on this: I believe that the most powerful message of The Matrix is not the virtual reality, but it is a message of a very strong transhumanistic attitude. Part 4 of the series already made it abundantly clear that they saw Morpheus as nothing more than idle ideology versus the harsh realities of life, when Niobe basically is shown as the wise elder preaching on the useless rebellion against a system where no victory is possible since slavery is eternal for the masses. But even the first episode of the series has revealed the true agenda of the makers' convictions: that humanity is not able to create with our minds and that it is only technology that is all powerful. Neo is nothing more than a false prophet according to them, as he is basically a magician that juggles code, his existence is no proof for a transcendent higher power, a God. Which is exactly why Neo is shown as a demi-God, to take away any illusion that there is a higher sentient being that is worth living for. Faith in God is fully replaced by the sect-like religion in the demi-God Neo, but on a technological basis, where his ability to manipulate the known and seen is what determines his power. This is transhumanism and atheism in its purest form, strengthened by a consciously religious cloak that Neo is perceived in: if that is how humans call someone a Messiah, then surely the Bible's a fraud too and there is no God, just illusions in our minds.The reason I have come to conclude this is based on the conscious difference they made between the original (Dark City) and their copy, The Matrix. In Dark City, we remain in the realm of fantasy. The hero, as well as the anti-heroes, create with their mind. It is a setting in a totally fictitious world, where the mind is the only creating force. But the people are REAL. Victims, but real. THEY have not been created by programs, not by the evil masterminds or by the hero. They cannot be ""un-thought"", no matter the powers that be. Anything else can, anything material. But the writer consciously avoided the possibility of bending humanity within this fantasy realm. Stopping time, yes, as a singular parameter, as well as all matter. But the induced sleep is not equal to undone thought or undone humanity, they even have to have minions walk around to people are kept being deceived. And as soon as the hero bends the fabric of life, both material and time, he can awaken the female protagonist, but not change her. Human sanctity remains untouched and its mysticism remains unexplained, just like our image of God can never be uncloaked. The movie remains in the realm of the intangible, because this ability of his cannot be technologically explained. It cannot be controlled by others, it is a gift, a blessing. And just like the endless possibilities that this gift offers him, the possible answers to the question ""Why?"" would offer endless possibilities as well, therefore making the question totally obsolete. And this is a perfect circle for the story to remain in the realm of fantasy.Contrary to The Matrix. The Wachowskis have consciously flipped the table by placing not just Neo, but all humans in the realm of the tangible. The virtual world and its endless possibilities, where those present do not know about being just a cogwheel in the machine, is a very realistic sci-fi setting, where merely the technological abilities are a threshold. As soon as we would reach the abilities where we can fully trick the mind into believing that the virtual world is the real one, we have achieved what we see in the Matrix.Which brings us to the message The Matrix conveys: we humans have the power to create The Matrix. And if we are skilled enough to do so, it might as well be that we live in a Matrix already.This seems all very straightforward for most and you may wonder why I find this a revelation: because it holds two very strong messages, that are both false and destructive.1. That we are in control of our fate through pure materialistic thinking, that there is no unseen force, no mysticism about life, to be found deep in us. That technology is the final frontier, not God or some higher power. And that power is a known external, not an unknown internal to be discovered. And that basically we ARE God, since we have the absolute power over our faith, it is just bits and bytes, when we can no longer distinguish between what is real and what isn't.2. That everything is inconsequential when it is virtual. No consequence, no responsibility. A game that you play and are freed from the burden that the human ethic, the human condition brings with itself. Especially responsibility towards society, but also towards yourself. Because if it is all a simulation, why would I keep to any ethics? Who cares if I steal, lie and murder for my ego, since it is all a game?There are YT vids of young gamers playing increasingly mentally deranged games. In less than 30 years time we have gone from a game that we play for fun to worlds we create to escape to and strip ourselves from our humanity, with little incentive to learn or develop any skills for the real world, in fact increasingly twisting minds. The extent to which people are becoming both desensitized towards externalities like violence, the morphing of their own self into abstract abominations (initially gender, now into anything but human), the olbiteration of ethics by living out utterly sick perversions in roleplaying especially (killing, stealing, betraying, envy, twisted sexual fantasies etc.), the instant gratification with which they want to turn themselves into efficiency machines to fit in as a cogwheel instead of enjoying the ride as an individual, while at the same time endless ""grinding"" of unproductive and useless routines to immerse in a virtual universe where the routine resembles real-life work just to create the false image that they are being productive, all of these are a mirror for escapism that typifies the virtual world that is gaining ground as a feasible alternative to our real world. But feeding the subconscious animal, which is showing its teeth when especially adolescents step out into the real world. School violence is no surprise as a result of this brainwash.The Wachowskis laid the groundwork for this trend, in the minds at least. Considering their bodily change, I do not believe this is coincidental. I think they very much religiously believe in transhumanism. Whether their movie and the twist they gave Dark City is wishful thinking or whether life imitates art and they have become a victim of their own fantasy, the result is the same: masses influenced by this ideology, that we are the creators of our own universe. And that there is no difference whether we eat that steak in bits and bytes, once the real world can no longer hold cows and grass and clean air.The moment that nobody believes there is a spoon, we really will be out of spoons.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
You don't know Kung-Fu.,"One of the most overrated films of ALL TIME, if not THE most overrated film of all time. Why people love this movie so much completely baffles me. I realize that different people have different opinions and tastes but even some fellow reviewers here that have comparable tastes to mine praise this film to my astonishment. There isn't anything great here, so why all the fuss? It's not original, and if you think it is you didn't see Dark City or a slew of others....the story is very slow, it's pretentious beyond words, and the acting is absolutely terrible to the point that it's hard to sit through without wanting to bite a running chainsaw, all thanks to the abysmally talented Reeves and Laurence Lamprey aka Cowboy Curtis. The ending is also weak, and don't tell me it's because they had planned on making a sequel because movies should be able to stand alone.....and don't even get me started on the sequels. At least they're not too overrated. I have felt this way since 1999 when it came out and I went to see it in the theater. When it was finally over, I said, ""That's it?!""Let's go over this piece, shall we? People praise this film for it's fight choreography, when the people fighting are tools like Fishburne and Reeves. Are you serious? I can't help but to laugh out loud at Keanu in the dojo training scene with Lamprey. He looks like he's got a Klingon dagger rammed up his butt! This is the ""One""?! I can't think of anyone more miscast. Actually, I can't think of a film where he wouldn't be miscast. True, a lot of my discontent with this film comes from the actors, but even with decent actors I still think it would've failed. The story is also sloppy and filled with more useless techno-babble than a quantum-physics book from Brent Spiner's ""Data"" from the Star Trek: The Next Generation series. To sum it up, it doesn't make any sense. People as batteries? OK. For a movie that spouts so much techno-babble at you, it's not very technical. It's all a red herring.My biggest problem with the people that like this film is that they praise it for it's originality when that could not be further from the truth. Do your research or just watch more movies and you'll begin to realize that this film is nothing more than a long list of rip-offs from others films....and it gets the credit for all of it. This isn't the film's fault, it's the uneducated fans....the same fans responsible for it's ridiculously lofty rating here at IMDb. I think the rip-offs were intentional personally, and I don't think even the Wachowski brothers thought it'd be as successful as it was because of it.Criminally overrated....and will not stand the test of time. The epitome of the phrase, ""Style over substance."" Just another summer blockbuster.It's a lot like Pokemon. People like it, but I can't understand why....and I don't think they do either. I think this will just be another fad. Time will tell.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A nice premise became very poor indeed,"I have to say, I was very tempted to write 'AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL!' in the one line summary, as that is my true opinion of this film. However, I thought it better to be a little more objective than that.I was intrigued by all the talk of how great The Matrix was, and at first, I was intrigued by it. Thomas Anderson, the agents that came looking for him, the talk about 'Morpheus' made me interested about just how the plot would turn out.However, after the blue pill/red pill scene, what had been a nice premise became very poor indeed. I can honestly say that I didn't care who was 'the one,' and with all the cryptic phrases and mumbo-jumbo this thing threw in, I began to wonder whether or not I was watching a bible story. It leaves you wondering just exactly what this film is trying to say.With the exception of Agent Smith, there was not one character I liked. I was praying Morpheus would die, as it might have brought this rubbish to an end. And what was with all those pointless one-liners? ""It's Neo."" ""Dodge this."" If I had watched this in a cinema, I would probably have been thrown out for shouting obscenities at the screen.All in all, a thorough waste of time. The interesting premise, special effects, and well-executed scene where Neo is being pursued by Smith just about lift it out of the dung-heap, but they don't compensate for all its faults.4/10 - Special effects and cryptic messages do not make a movie",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The sfx were out of this world, the fight scenes were the best I've probably ever seen.  The plot kept pace with the non-stop action by making you question the reality of which you live in. The Wachowski brothers have completely redefined what great sfx can do for a movie.  Keanu puts in a great performance, mainly because they limited the amount of dialogue he had, as Neo the reluctant leader of a resistance to free humanity.  The movie immediately grabs you and holds you for the remainder, with the exception of your mouth dropping open during the mind blowing action scenes.

A film that inspired a generation of movie makers.,"Unfortunately, no one can be told what the matrix is - apt description of a movie that has spawned an entire generation of films/series that have subscribed to one or the other concept in this film : Avatar, Kungfu Panda, King Arthur, Westworld, the other Wachowski brother films such as V for Vendetta, Cloud Atlas .. the list just goes on. The fact that it is loaded with so many seminal concepts weaved into such an entertaining format makes it that inexplicable phenomenon - you could question the casting then, as the only weakness, but I doubt if even the Wachowski Brothers knew what they will end up making. I see film making as pre-Matrix & post-Matrix. It is my personal holy scripture that guides me on every aspect of personal & professional life - and it still keeps resonating with me every time I see it. Watch it if you love punches or punchlines - this film has a truckload of them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Laurence Fishburne can tell you,"THE MATRIX is overrated quite a lot, I think. Visually strong the movie really cannot stun me with such a poor story line. The real contents seem to be: impressing the viewer be revealing new facts about the amazing Matrix-world. But after having caught in which way the Matrix works it is just boring seeing Laurence Fishburne explaining and explaining what has already been explained. His never ending monologues nearly ruin the whole movie. It is not that interesting hearing ´´it is like this´´ and ´´it works like that´´ for half an hour. The rating of 8.4 points in the IMDB is too high, I think. I rated the Matrix 6 points.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Even better than I remember! 10/10,"Back in 1999 this instantly became my number 1 favourite film. I had it on VHS and watched it more times than I care to remember. Heard it was showing on TV so I thought I'd put on the DVD (in case they cut anything out). I hadn't seen the first film for many years and was really looking forward to it. I was glued to the screen like never before. This was not just nostalgia, it was all those years of growing as a person, as a film lover and as someone who is probably much harder to please/entertain than my teenage self! Revisiting a film I loved as a teenager, I fully accepted the possibility that I would be left feeling a little deflated. I was not. It is perfect. Every. Single. Moment. It is a masterpiece IMHO. I am not one to look for faults (there are none anyway), I prefer to just sit back and enjoy the work and passion everyone involved in a film has put into it. The cast is stellar, the look, style and feel is absolutely stunning and the soundtrack seems even more fitting and perfectly in tune with it after all these years. The camera work and editing are so refreshing after seeing so much hyperspeed in modern films. The balance is just right here because you can follow everything that happens and you can actually see everything, without having to rewind 10 times or freeze frame for important details that are so easy to miss. The Matrix is a shining example of the Sci-Fi genre and has remained in my top 5 all these years. It's back at number 1 too. I absolutely love it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Welcome to the Real world,"Without a doubt one of the best and most influential movies of all time, the Matrix is the defining science fiction film of the 1990's and the biggest leap the genre has taken since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: a Space Odyssey and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The Matrix is a ground-breaking motion picture that not only raised the bar for all the science-fiction films to come after it but also redefined the action genre with its thrilling action sequences and revolutionary visual effects.The film tells the story of Thomas Anderson a computer hacker that in the world of hacking goes by the alias of Neo. When he is contacted by the mysterious outlaw Morpheus and having always questioned his reality, he is awakened to the truth that the world he's been living in is a simulated reality called the Matrix and that he's nothing more than a slave in this dystopian world, created and controlled by A.I powered machines.The direction and script by the Wachowskis is fantastic, as they drew ideas and inspirations from every other great sci-fi and cyberpunk movie and anime before the film, combining it with stunning action and putting it into one picture that has enough style, substance and subtext that everyone ended up giving their own interpretation of the story. The research that went into the preparation of the screenplay is quite extensive but the manner in which it is presented on the big screen is also very impressive. Every character presented on the film, has a well-defined arc and a purpose, and their motivations are clear.The cinematography is impeccable. It was very innovative in the use of the camera angles and movements, the zooms, the slow motion captures and the different color palette used to differentiate the Matrix and the real World. The editing is flawless, as it makes sure that every scene is integral to the story and ensures the pace of the film stays ferocious through its entire runtime. Each frame is also packed with so much visual information for the viewer to devour. The visual effects introduced us to the bullet-time effect and their impact can still be felt in today's movies. The performances are also incredible. Each member of the cast gave their best performances and brought the characters they portray to life, but the one that stands out the most is Hugo Weaving's disciplined rendition of his character, Agent Smith; a powerful computer program made to search and destroy the human rebellion, in undoubtedly the greatest performance in his career.In conclusion The Matrix is a masterpiece everyone should see. It is one of the most thought provoking, inventive, pioneering, influential and stylish movies of all time and it's also full of philosophical and religious allegories. Immortal for its contribution to cinema and pop culture, its brilliant combination of inventive visual effects, excellent vision and exquisite action easily makes it one of the best, most influential and most entertaining movies ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

I'm told that the matrix has you...,"Keanu Reaves, Lawrence Fishburne, Carrie Ann MossThe Matrix is a very interesting movie about reality. How does one know exactly what is going on in their lives, if they are confined only to what their 5 senses are telling them?The Hype: Hype is hype, no matter what movie is popular at the time. Do not listen to your friends who tell you it sucked, or was totally awesome. Watch it yourself, and rate it.The Acting: Many people say that the acting in this movie was horrible. I disagree. I think that a large group of people trying to get their world back wouldn't have much of a culture to make an example for them on how to express themselves in ""this certain way"" that most other movies are shown in. Everyone in the movie was acting humbled by fear, which is exactly what anyone would act like in that situation.The Story: It raises a lot of discussion points, and ideas of what is reality, what is control (picks up more in Matrix Reloaded), religious references (mostly for extremists to scream at each other about), armageddon, do we need machines, is there a such thing as technologically going too far, should AI theory be developed; ect. I believe the storyline of this movie was a lot better than most others, especially nowadays, when movies like ""The Fast and the Furious"", ""XXX"", ""Torque"", and my own personal least-favorite, ""Biker Boyz"".  If you have action, then why not have more of a story.Action: Really cool for the time, but once you've seen a fight scene once or twice, it's time to move on.Good Movie  9.5 out of 10go see it",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
More fun than summer vacation.,"I really like this movie, but seeing it ranked #40 of all time is laughable. There is, or course, the geek effect, the fact that techie folk who frequent this forum are likely to rate a techie film abnormally high, but there must be hundreds of films, at least, that deserve to be ranked higher than this one.Granted, it is a great story.  Not Star Wars great, and certainly not Lawrence of Arabia or even Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe great.  But oh what a concept.  Humans have been subjugated by their machines, a concept James Cameron explored ages ago in the Terminator pictures.  But Matrix has more wow and gee whiz than any of its genre.The fight scenes are spectacular.  Carrie-Anne Moss kicks ass and looks great doing it.  Hugo Weaving may not be the most intimidating man in black, and I still think of him as Mitzi from Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, but I wouldn't get on his bad side.  And I have to admire this movie for not going the brain dead muppet route of so many otherwise great sci-fi films just to milk the aftermarket.Keanu Reeves, who has made a great career out of so very little talent, may have found his best vehicle since Bill and Ted.  His deadpan, detached delivery is perfect, especially in the films climactic battle between Reeves and Weaving.  I have to say that I can't imagine a Matrix without him.My absolute favorite scene is the one with Spoon Boy.  ""There is no spoon."" I still get chills.  I also have to say that I didn't quite buy Joe Pantoliano selling out his comrades because he missed the taste of a good steak.  I think that story line could have used a little work.  Laurence Fishburne is definitely the class of the cast, and I am delighted that he has signed on for both sequels, already in production.All in all, you absolutely must own this movie.  It is fraught with clever allusions, dazzling effects, and more fun than summer vacation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Good, but...","I side with the negative crowd on this one; with the risk of sounding pompous I have to say this: To believe that this is a brilliant film suggest a low level of education and an underdeveloped personal philosophy. There, I've said it. To question the realness of reality is a 400-year old Cartesian idea. Actually, it was explored more interestingly in the old Star Trek episode ""Spectre of the Gun"" in 1969. The rest of the film is an obvious rip-off of ""The Terminator"" and all of John Woo, which are far more interesting movies. The film ponders too long on the central premise, and there isn't enough action to make it a good action movie, either. Still, overall production design is great, but the acting is wooden, and Fishburne makes for an unconvincing guru. All the good scenes were revealed in the trailer, so there's not much else to do than just sit in the theatre and feel patronized by the whole thing. At least, that's what I did.

One of the Greatest Flukes of All Time.,"""The Matrix"" is easily one of the most, if not the most, over-rated film ever made. It is short on characterization and direction and all the performances are sub-par. A group of innovative special effects dazzled many, but I was unimpressed by them as well. In many ways, the film is ugly and cheap looking. Keanu Reeves plays a computer hacker who learns from a strange group of rebels what his true purpose for living is to help stand against a department of controllers who run what is really reality. Exactly. The plot is so stupid and it just makes no sense most of the time. Keanu Reeves usually makes films work, but he cannot save this mess. The same is true for dependable players like Joe Pantoliano and Laurence Fishburne who just seem lost in the maze that is the movie. In short ""The Matrix"" is eye-candy and little else. Save your time and look at a group of Picasso's paintings instead. They are just as empty and meaningless as ""The Matrix"". 2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Psudo intellectual dribble...,"I know that this is one of the most popular movies of all time, but that is a flaw in the viewing public. The main reason I dislike this movie so much is because it was a rip off of a much better movie that came out a couple years before it. That being Dark City. Lets review the similarities shall we? First of all our main character wakes up disoriented and not understanding the world around him JM because he lost his memory and Neo because he is taken out of the matrix. We find that both characters have been given a false set of memories by puppeteers (be them aliens or robots) We find that these puppeteers are doing the same thing for all people in an attempt to keep their own race going (matrix as batteries DC cus they need to find the soul) Finally the main character proves to be the savior of the humans by finding they are the only one who can put an end to the false lives that the puppeteers are forcing humans to live. they both do this through the same method. by having a mentor teach them how to use the devices of their captors against them (neo learns how to hack and control the matrix while Murdoc learns how to use the machines of the strangers to alter reality. also we see stylish black leather as the main wardrobe in the matrix. black leather gowns are the main wardrobe for the strangers. moving away from the rip off problem we see that Dark City has a message implying you to ask yourself if your identity is more than just the sum of your memories. the matrix makes people feel smart for understanding the movie, but really offers no deep thought. the feel of Dark City is also better since it has the dark ambiance created by the same director as The Crow. while the matrix has nothing new or special about its ""feel"" just your basic action movie with a plot to try to make the viewer feel smart.

"25 years on, The Matrix is still a spectacular and mind blowing science fiction classic..","The Matrix set the benchmark for all science fiction movies upon its release back in 1999. One of the biggest blockbusters of the year, the movie received high acclaim with groundbreaking special effects (which also netted a well deserved Academy Award for Best Visual Effects), incredible stunts, action sequences, and a mindblowing story. It would also be one of the most memorable movies for Keanu Reeves as well as for Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss and Hugo Weaving.Keanu Reeves plays computer hacker Thomas Anderson/Neo who finds himself drawn into an alternate reality where everything is not all what it seems. The big question is ""What is the Matrix?"", and what is real or is it a dream. He is drawn into the underground world by Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) to the leader of the rebellion Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). Neo's biggest threat is Agent Smith (delightfully played by Hugo Weaving) who is pursuing Neo, Morpheus and Trinity to eliminate any kind of resistance and exposure of their new reality.Directed by The Wachowskis, The Matrix also stars Joe Pantoliano, Belinda McClory, Robert Taylor, Gloria Foster, Marcus Chong, Julian Arahanga, Matt Doran, Anthony Ray Parker, and Paul Goddard.25 years on, The Matrix is still regarded as one of the best science fiction movies of all time and easily one of the best movies of the 90's. The visual effects which raised the bar very high in 1999 have also aged very well over time and it is still regarded as highly impressive and spectacular. It is also one of Keanu Reeves' most memorable movies right up with the Bill and Ted trilogy, Point Break (1991), Speed (1994) and the John Wick anthology. Unfortunately the sequels weren't the same and was met with a mixed reception by critics and audiences alike.Though The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions (both 2003) were box office hits, The Matrix Revolutions (2021) would be a forgettable box office flop.""This is your last chance.

However , it never feels didactic and never try to preach something . The Audience are given fair amount of space to actually process the events which develops the bond and relatibility with the movie.

The Matrix has such an amazing concept going for it, and I won't spoil anything at all in case you've never seen it, but this concept has handled so well. It has a lot of biblical and philosophical things behind it that just make it incredibly fascinating to watch. The story, plot, and screenplay were all handled amazingly and the word building is flawless. Keanu Reeves plays our protagonist, Neo, and he goes through this hero's journey that is just handled expertly. The movie looks amazing and has such a distinct style that makes it stand out from everything else. The action might not be your cup of tea, but I thought it was thoroughly entertaining. Even if the action isn't your thing, the best part here is that the movie doesn't make itself about action. Everything that's not action is just done so well, the movie has such an incredible amount of tension, suspense, and momentum. My only problem with this movie is that it ends. I was genuinely depressed when this ended. The movie was not only a super fun ride, a super well crafted ride, but it made me think about life from a different perspective. I'd be glad to discuss this movie more with anyone, but I'm on mobile so I'll end the review here. 10/10, a perfect masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
If I were a machine using human beings as batteries,"I saw this movie last night on German TV, and there must be something to it, because after I went to bed I dreamt I myself was caught in the Matrix, trying to convince Morpheus that an unexpected intruder to his ship was benign and ending up as Morpheus's secretary. Possibly it is the dreamlike quality of the movie that makes it a classic. There are some scenes visually compelling, if not really beautiful (e.g. the green insect penetrating Neo's body). But the excessive martial arts sequences were at first annoying and then, as they became more frequent, I was just bored by them (just as in Charlie's Angels, if this comparison is politically correct). Obviously martial arts are fashionable, but I never cared for Bruce Lee either. In general, The Matrix forgot about its lofty aspirations as it drew towards its end, turning into a plain action movie with endless special effects, fireworks, shooting, and all, even with a helicopter. But what about the very idea of the Matrix? Isn't it just nonsense? After all, if machines took control of the world, using human beings as ""batteries,"" these machines could easily put the poor humans into a perpetual coma, leaving them without consciousness, a state in which they would even spend less energy to sustain themselves, making the whole thing more efficient for the machines. Such human beings would not need any surrogate reality; the Matrix, which is not only a complex box of tricks, but also a waste of energy, would become obsolete.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Revolutionary idea but cliché adaptation,"Years ago, when I was in grade 10, we watched this in ethics class. My teacher Mrs. Kosiol proudly announced that she had interpreted how the Matrix was inspired by Plato's cave allegory before the maker of this movie mentioned it.I just rewatched it mostly because I don't remember everything in the movie and want to watch its sequels. The first half of the movie really had me. All these ideas must have been so revolutionary for 1999 and surely defined parts of film-making. Some ideas like AIs and humans destroying the planet seem overused nowadays but for 1999 this is a remarkable movie.I really like the matrix idea. As my teacher said, it really is like Plato's allegory and it's interesting and scary to think about what were if the matrix was actually true. The idea also reminded me of the Infinite Tsukuyomi from Naruto. I wonder if Kishimoto was inspired by the matrix.So the first half really had me and I kinda wanted to like this movie but so many points just destroyed the feel for me. Especially the second half was pretty boring and absurd.With such an intriguing idea as the matrix, why does there have to be all those fight scenes? Why does there have to be hand-to-hand combat and gunshots and what-not? Maybe that generates more viewership in the cinema but for me it really didn't fit the scene.And then the very ending, like what was that? Why does Trinity have to wait so long and tell Neo something almost meaningless in front of the phone booth? For god sake, just get out and then you have all the time in the world to say whatever you want.It was all to set up some romance between Neo and Trinity. But I ask you: Why?! This was so forced and at no point of the movie it seemed like there would be a romantic relationship arising between them. It was romance just for the sake of a Hollywood kiss.And then there is Neo. How flat can a character be? This guy has absolutely no personality besides being the one. And him going back in to save Morpheus also just doesn't fit his personality, it is a forced superhero behaviour. Then, at the end he just randomly becomes overpowered for no reason at all. Oh, I guess there is a reason - the power of love. How cliché.He starts flexing and fighting one-handed but man just get the **** out of the matrix. We don't even know what these people see in Neo. Why was he chosen? His hacker personality seems to have almost no impact at all. Neo is really one of the worst written characters I've seen recently.It's a revolutionary movie that you should have seen to experience the idea of the matrix. But other than these ideas, it is not too watch-worthy.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
like,"Revisiting this film, although it was a decade or two ago, is still so technical, the idea is so advanced. Faith from the reins of imagination, the performance of the sky, again let people worship. So, I'm a little worried that the fourth part will be a bad tail of a mink. After all, Keanu is also old, the face is no longer handsome and brave. Watching the ""Matrix"" trilogy, the shock is still there, especially the film in the visual language of the peak of the achievement, is still difficult to overcome. Like that war in the rain, has been a lot of film imitation, salute, but can not be classic to continue.

ZZZZZZZ,"I have never fallen asleep at the cinema, but The Matrix is the closest I've ever come to doing so.  Quite frankly, the first hour of this film is the most boring hour of film ever.Keanu Reeves cannot act, neither can Laurence Fishburne, Carrie Ann Moss doesn't do much better.  The whole thing is too dark, and let's be honest: If you've seen the trailer, you don't need to see the film, as it shows you all the special effects there anyway.I've been more disappointed by other films, but I fail to see how this uninspiring and badly acted mess is hailed so much by fans.  Any old fool can string together a series of special effects, the trick is to link them with a good story and enjoyable characters.  The Matrix does neither.I'll admit it picks up a bit in the second half, but I was so completely and utterly appalled by the first hour, no amount of bullet time, however impressive, can save this film.My Rating: 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Still a great movie after 22 years!!,"I first saw The Matrix on its initial theatre release back in 1999. I've seen bits and pieces of it over the years on TV but hadn't really sat down to watch if again properly until now having bought The Matrix Trilogy on Blu-ray. The movie is still a great sci-fi flick and worthy of being called one of the best. The fights scenes, although a little slow this day and age, are well choreographed and heavy hitting - I particularly enjoy when people get thrown against or through walls and this movie has plenty of that! The bullet time effects and slow motion shots still hold up, and even though other films have copied it, The Matrix was the original and still does it better if you ask me. The storyline still feels futuristic even after 22 years and the CGI, although looking a tad dated, is still pretty sharp mostly (better than what was in the sequel, The Matrix Reloaded, oddly). The story can get a little confusing at times for new comers, infact there were things in this viewing that I had not picked up on or understood previously so just one viewing may not be enough to truely appreciate the film. The one thing the film didn't do for me however was the emotional relationships - I liked the characters, but the relationship between Neo and Trinity felt a bit forced for my liking. My favourite scene is the fight in the Subway between Agent Smith and Neo - it was a great lead in and a very back and foward encounter with neither man truely gaining the upperhand.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Tedium Beyond Belief,"I really cannot understand the hype & gushing praise for this sfx/cgi gloated film.The story is routine - a contemporary mix of Men In Black, Tron and a shedload of other ""10 seconds to go before the world is destroyed"" movies.The principle idea of a make-believe world called The Matrix, a world where we all live totally oblivious to the fact that this world is totally artificial and controlled by machines, could have been immensely interesting in the hands of a better set of scriptwriters & directors. In any case this kind of story isn't a million miles away from Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide To the Galaxy, a book far more interesting than this rubbish.For the sake of a good story the Wachoowski Brothers (writers & directors) went all gooey for lots of cgi to distract the viewer with the many plotholes and poor character development. The story simply gets in the way of a good sfx. And on and on it goes, each cgi trying to out ""wow"" the previous effect to the point where you wonder whether this is nothing more than an expensive computer game.People went wild when we saw our heroes climb up walls, jump huge rooftops & dodge speeding bullets in slowmo. But so what? I feel we have become so blaise about cgi that only our imagination limits us to what we think is possible. And the cgi in this film no longer had the same kind of ""jaw dropping"" effect as one witnessed in Star Wars, Terminator 2 or even 2001:Space Odyssey.Our superheroes, Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishbourne & Carrie Annie Moss, looked like bit players compared to the computer bits making up the over indulgent CGIs. Fishbourne tries to come over all cool & hip, but looks fairly average when asked to do anything remotely interesting; Reeves acts just like...well...Reeves, with that usual ""no one's home"" expression & designer jackets. While Moss hops in & out of the movie when it looks as if the going's getting a bit tough for Reeves, resulting in an ending ripped straight from Luc Besson's 5th Element!This film lives off its own hype & marketing, and already looks dated. Once you've viewed the film more than a couple of times and got used to the sfx you then want to look for more depth only to find that its only the sfx that holds the film together.BAD!**/*****",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Unoriginal and uninspired!,"I can't believe that anyone would seriously suggest that this film was even average!  It was worst film I have seen in a very long time.The movie had so little to offer, it is hard to only point to specific flaws:1) Keanu has to be one of the worst actors of our era.  He shows no signs of even moderate intelligence or talent, and as a hero, he comes across as flat and unispiring.  It is hard to believe that his character would have anything to offer that would distingish him from your average idiot.  And in action scenes, it was impossible to tell if he is *supposed* to look silly or if he can't help it.  No charisma, no flair, just pathetic.2) Very shallow and poor development of an unoriginal idea.  The idea that our reality is not real at all is hardly original.  It has been the subject of science fiction for decades, and a successful treatment of the subject should delve into some psychological depths.  We should be left wondering whether our world truly is real.  Or we should get a sense of how willing or unwilling we might be to face the fact that our world is an illusion.  We should wonder whether it matters if our world is an illusion, or whether reality is what we perceive as real.  Whatever the protrayal, we should leave the theater feeling intellectually moved.  While the film briefly brushed on some of these topics, it was so brief and shallow that no impression was left.  Instead, focus returned to martial arts which had no real purpose in terms of the plot.3) The story dragged as we were forced to sit through an explanation of the matrix that was completely obvious--a couple of visual effects would have gotten the point across in less than a minute with more effect.  While the characters beat the idea of the matrix to death in the dialogue, it did little to shed light into the hearts and minds of the characters.  What was their motivation, from where did they get their drive and courage?  Why were they able to sense the matrix?  None of the answers are even touched upon, and the characters are flat and unrealistic as a result.4) The idea of the matrix is very poorly thought out.  Instead of creating a believable world and believable rules for the matrix, the plot resorts to physical fighting, which makes no sense at all.  The film obviously had no intention of stretching the mind of the viewer, instead catering to an audience of mindless action-addicts. While action might have added to a well-thought out film, it cannot support a film where the premise is psychological or intellectual.5) No sense of despair, darkness, or power from the futuristic scenes. The future world is portrayed so little that we really don't even have a chance to be overwhelmed by how horrible it could be.  In an attempt to make a happy action film, the dark undertones were completely dropped.The very few redeeming values were: 1) Interesting use of slow-motion action 2) A few nice special effects (no more than an average action film these days) 3) A promising premise.  While not original, the idea has great potential. Several other films, such as Dark City have shown a bit of this potential, and there is a plethora of such plots in books.In short, any thoughtful, insightful, meaningful, or inspired treatment of a potentially interesting idea was completely dropped to show a few almost laughably out of place action scenes.  The fact that people rave about this movie shows that people are willing to swallow the mindless just for some cool effects.  How sad.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Stop the insanity-This is not a good movie! Where did the script go?,"I really can't understand all of the accolades that this film continues to receive.  Has the entire world gone insane and forgotten that what makes a good movie is its script.  Has everything become about special effects, special effects and more special effects?   Sure, if you want special effects, this is definitely the movie for you.  If I was writing this entry for the Special Effects Message Board, I would have given it a 10/10 rating. But frankly, I need more than great visuals to have a movie work for me and as this film has nothing else, it gets a 1 rating.I know my rating won't dissuade the masses from singing the praises of this movie.  I know that my rating won't stop the inevitable outcome of Matrix II becoming the highest grossing film of all time during its opening weekend. Perhaps the only thing this review will do is lead like minded people in the direction of other movies that deal with similar themes yet actually have characters that you will care about.Let me make clear, that the core concept of Matrix is a great one.  The whole idea of our world being part of someone else's imagination is something that has fascinated me for as long as I can remember.  When Matrix originally debuted, you couldn't have paid me to stay away from the theater. Someone had finally put one of the great philosophic debates into movie form and I knew that it had to be incredible.   Instead, the only thing incredible about the film (beside the special effects) was how wrong I had been.There on the screen was a movie without any real screenplay.  No matter how much I tried, I couldn't bring myself to care about these characters because they just weren't real.   You would think that in a film dealing with reality-as-you-know-it crumbling around the main characters, that there would be some exploration into how the newly revealed reality affected their psyches.   But that doesn't happen here.  Instead, we are given a movie where the emphasis is placed upon stocking up on as many guns and other weapons as possible so that the bad guys can be shot and killed.   Give me a break!!!I think what has happened in these type of movies is that the producers are handed a great idea and then spend their entire budget on the actors and special effects.  They don't bother to spend anything on the screenplay because they have realized that good ones aren't necessary anymore.  Just give the public some nice CGI and they'll flock to the theatre. Unfortunately, they seem to be right.   Movies like Matrix and and the Jurassic Park series continue to sell out even though the stories are horrible.  Give us a cool CGI Dinosaur running around a city or make the lead characters do CGI kung-fu moves and we'll go home happy.   Never mind that we have absolutely no insight into who the main characters are.  We don't need to care about them as long as they are involved in computerized situations!   (Did anyone actually give a damn whether Jeff Goldblum's character lived or died in Lost World?)Anyway - my point is that you can certainly make a film exploring ideas and concepts similar to those in these mega movies and still have the audience care about the characters.In the case of Matrix, for those interested in a good ""reality-as-you-know-it"" type of movie, I would suggest Josef Rusnak's 'Thirteenth Floor' or even better yet, if you can handle sub-titles, Alejandro Amenabar's ""Open Your Eyes"".   Both of these movies manage to give you an incredible story, with characters you will remember long after the credits have rolled.  Believe it or not, you'll actually find yourself wondering about the characters' futures rather than simply commenting on how cool that CGI generated flip-in-the-air was.Good movies are supposed to leave you with questions. They are supposed to make you think.  You didn't really have to do that with Matrix, and its a shame because the movie could and should have been so much more than it ended up being.In my opinion, Matrix was a waste of both time and money.  I will just keep praying that one day the movie going public will give up on these special effects monsters and turn back to the days of enjoying movies with plots. On that day, films like ""Open Your Eyes"" will finally get their due and Hollywood will stop giving us mere eye candy like Matrix and similar ilk.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Keanu Reeves was born on September 2nd, 1964","OK! I understand what the Matrix is and I get that Neo is the Chosen One.

I appreciate the Wachowski brothers' attempt to create a new ground-breaking approach to action sequences and story-telling, no matter how snobbish it looks. A pomposity that says, they expect the audience to believe what is going on in the film and to embrace it, but when it also gushes from the screen with cerebral gibberish and drawn out sequences, it slows the pace down and makes it difficult to enjoy fully.Again, the action sequences, with the slow-motion wire techniques, are top notch. The acting works, even Keanu, but unfortunately the dialogue reminds me of Stan Lee in the 60s. What saves this film, along with the action and Carrie-Anne Moss' leather pants, is the approach to political extremes and what people would do if we had to adopt a neo-world/pseudo-world philosophy and what the dangers that could occur when technology and evil are mixed.8.1 (B MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

There is definitely not a glitch in 'The Matrix',"'The Matrix' became an instant phenomenon that spawned two direct sequels, several video games, and graphic novels. Not to mention how much that movie has been an influence on the films of the 21st century in general.'The Matrix' although released twenty years ago, is still as fresh as it was upon its release. Yes, some can argue that the technology (cellphones and computers) is outdated, but this is the least of the worries - the story takes place inside a computer-generated world that is modeled after the year 1999. The special effects combining CGI with practical stunts and sets still look amazing, and there aren't many movies that came after that have surpassed 'The Matrix' in this department. Fight scenes are as beautiful as ballet, and that sort of poetic fighting choreography is another thing that many (in Hollywood) have tried to replicate, but have failed. Not to mention the film's thought-provoking premise, and its philosophical aspects that have been the basis to numerous essays, reviews, and even studies. Yet, none of its ambitions or allegories (religious or not) feel pretentious. The serious subject matter is masterfully mixed with fantastic visual effects, thus creating a movie which ideas we can discuss over, or simply being an entertaining action epic.Well developed characters and not only the main ones are also an attestation about masterful writing and well thought out screenplay. Side characters are not there just to be killed off in some flashy way.There are few movies that became instant classics, and even fewer are those that stand the test of time in today's fast-moving world and can pull theater full even twenty years later*.*Went to see the special screening on July 3rd. 2019.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A masterpiece of sci-fi,"Modern masterpiece, one of the most influential movies from the 90""s that sparkled 2 more sequels but the first Matrix is the ONE.
The story follows Neo, a hacker whose been approached by a group of strangers who claims that the world and everything we see is just a computer simulation program called Matrix and that human kind is in some kind of hibernation . After excepting the new truth Neo begins to fight Matrix and try to free human kind as a chosen One.
Definitely one of my favorite movies with great story and terrific cast and one of the movies that makes you think about life in general. The premise that everything is simulation even started a lots of conspiracy theories among people who even go that far to believe this to be accurate.
Apart from the great story we have a breakthrough special effects that still looks great today 20 years after the movie was maid.
And i have to mention personally one of the greatest movie soundtrack ever made with names like Rob Zombie,Marilyn Manson, the Prodigy etc.

Philosophical drama meets science fiction (again),"The best science fiction films always seem to have solid groundings inphilosophy. Star Trek is the classic example, and Star Wars also ventures into some philosophical grounds. The Matrix follows that tradition, and yet it still manages to be fresh.Thomas Anderson is your average decent person who goes to work, pays histaxes and helps his landlady take out the garbage. Yet he dreams. He dreams sometimes so vividly that the dreams become almost real. He is confronted by mysterious hackers named Morpheus and Trinity who tell him that what seemsreal to him is in fact little more than an illusion - and they free him into a post- apocalyptic world in which machines are in complete control, harvestinghumans as power sources while keeping them sedate with the illusion of theMatrix. And he finds himself, along with the few free humans there are, charged with the task of freeing those still trapped inside the illusion.Not a new idea, to be sure. The notion that all we see and feel is an illusion dates back to Shakyamuni Buddha. But the film is nevertheless engrossing and edgy, even when produced on such a limited budget. It incorporates specialeffects that give it almost an anime-like feel (slow-motion and changingperspective) without making it seem tacky, and gives rise to what is sure tobecome one of the most memorable action scenes in the history of sciencefiction films. The acting by Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and CarrieAnne Moss is spectacular in some areas though overwrought in others (thefilm's only drawback). Overall, this movie gets a 9/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Over-rated, unoriginal Hollywood style fest","I loved the Matrix--when it was a film released in 1998 called  Dark City, a far superior, character driven entry in the sci-fi genre. The Matrix, with its dazzling special effects, is nothing more than a silly tale of perseption vs reality. Everyone's view of the film seems to be manipulated by the effects. If we were dealing with Blade Runner style effects instead of Doritos inspired ""bullet time"" effects, would the film still be considered as memorable? I highly doubt it. Laurence Fishburne is good as Morpheus, Moss is ok but her character elicits no sympathy or emotion from me, and Keanu Reeves is just ok, but none of these characters are as intriguing as those of Dark City. The kung fu was obviously inspired by the late Hong Kong style of fighting (IE wire fu and CGI instead of actual skills and choreography.) This was designed to make the simpletons of today go ""ooh"" and ""ahh"" while real kung fu afficionados ache over the obvious fakeness and frustration of chop editing, thus inspiring furhter kung fu crap like CROUCHING TIGER, EXIT WOUNDS, and ROMEO MUST DIE. Matrix does boast some wonderful cinematography, but so does Dark City and it boasts a better story along with it, too. I'll give this film a 5 out of because in originality it's not in the top, in style it's not original, in acting it's saved by one, and story, pretty basic but not complex. Dark City is better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Overrated and brimming with convenience,"I didn't like The Matrix. I thought it was an alright movie until I saw it again, then it just got to be annoying. I know only pseudo-intellectuals use this term, but it was pseudo-intellectual. I thought the characters were wooden, the dialogue was pretty bad, and it was all too convenient for me. When a character skips over the growth and learning process because they just downloaded the skills, like flying a helicopter or learning kung fu, I see that as a flaw in the story and writing. Then where does it stop? I was expecting a character to actually say, ""Well...yeah...I know how because I uh...I downloaded a...program."" Nobody's fooling me with the whole ""it's about computers, they can do that"" bit. Save it for the 13-year-olds that ""understand"" the plot. There are smarter and more creative ways of conveying this idea. I hated the fight scenes as well. CGI on almost every fight, especially when everything looks like a game later does not mean its good. Far from it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Is it possible that the entire world is simulated by a computer,"Is it possible that the entire world is simulated by a computer, and we and everything around us are just a string of code in the computer?
""You are like everyone, born a slave, you were born in a prison you can't perceive""
This conjecture is shocking enough, but the depth of ""The Matrix"" does not stop there, it also raises new questions on this basis:
Will you choose blue pills or red pills?
Is it to choose a beautiful illusion or a cruel reality?
On the surface, it seems to be a good choice, but it is actually much more difficult than we thought.
On one side is the future world of apocalypse, torn by hunger and cold, and the danger of being chased by robots
On one side is a warm and peaceful era, with blue sky and white clouds, beautiful scenery, and even the opportunity to become a successful person.
Indeed, everyone knows that no matter how beautiful the dream is, it is just a dream.
But Sever is willing to sell everyone for a dream.
If we really escape the matrix and experience the cruelty of reality, maybe we will make the same choice as Sever.

Although scientifically improbable, the premise is possible, which is what makes the film interesting to watch. However, I was waiting for Alex Winter to make an appearance as a serious ally. Reeves is not a straight actor; he is a comedy actor exclusively. He is just not believable to most adults in a serious role.

This film requires the usual sci-fi suspension of disbelief but has several things going for it:  the characters are actually developed in a detective-movie-noirish way, the hero and others struggle with decisions and THEN act, as opposed to JUST doing something, and most obviously the film has a color-and-costuming visual style that remains a bold statement throughout the production.This is a film that chronicles the style of the turn of this century in the same way that ""Georgy Girl"" caught the London of the 1960's, and that ""Laura"" captured the deco-elegant look of the 1940's.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"mildly entertaining, yet fundamentally wretched","I'm waiting, like a vulture, for this movie to become dated. And it will. The club scene, the sunglasses, the fashions, the cell phones - oh yes, one day it will all look and sound unbearably corny. And then, we'll have to actually pay attention to the script and the acting (or lack thereof). And we will realize that this movie reeks.For an action film, it's remarkably dull, with the first half basically consisting of a looong string of complex explanations. It doesn't help that Neo is a totally flat character. If I'm to care that he's trapped in the Matrix, I need to see more of his life there. Sadly, one scene of Neo at work, being berated by the boss, does not a fascinating character make. I also think it was a terrible mistake to make him a programmer, since he already understands the nature of computers and should, therefore, be more receptive to the idea of the Matrix instead of consistently incredulous. And am I supposed to believe that this master hacker doesn't know what an EMP is?The film is also terribly derivative. Morpheus is an even more gaseous version of Yoda, and Neo is clearly based on Luke (promising young man discovers super-powers and helps rebels overthrow their nasty oppressors). The visual style is ripped off from the Alien movies, as is the snake-like parasite that somehow manages to burst through Neo's bellybutton without leaving a mark. The evil agents clearly evoke The X-Files, the notion that mankind is enslaved by robots in an apocalyptic future comes straight out of The Terminator, and - most damningly of all - the concept of a virtual reality environment called the Matrix had featured some 23 years earlier in an episode of Doctor Who (""The Deadly Assassin""). Maybe the Matrix didn't consciously rip off all of these sources, but it's certainly worth noting that this movie is utterly unoriginal in every respect but its action photography (and that will, like all the rest, probably date badly).Needless to say, Reeves is pretty bland, and Fishbourne is just plain embarrassing in his first scene (it doesn't help that his every dire line is punctuated by a melodramatic bolt of lightning). Only Carrie-Anne Moss's Trinity comes up smelling like a rose, and it's good to see such a strong role for a female character - though I think she should've been the hero, as she's got more charisma than everyone else put together.I was quite disturbed by the metal detector scene, as it appears to be nothing more than a particularly violent video game sequence that's meant to inspire future generations of random crazy shooting maniacs. It's worth mentioning that the security guards who are so callously slaughtered by Neo and Trinity are not evil, just thralls of the Matrix, like Neo had been merely days before. Why, therefore, does he have no qualms about blowing them all to bits? Tacky, man - really tacky.I enjoyed Joe Pantoliano's character, probably because he was allowed to have an actual set of motivations and opinions, whereas the other characters are just filler. And you know, a few segments were effective; the Oracle has real presence. But the film is basically a dog, and while it pretends to cast all kinds of light on the problems with modern society, at the end of the day it's a stupid action movie that raises interesting issues, then resolves them with ridiculously OTT karate battles.As a movie, The Matrix is decent entertainment. As sci-fi, it's derivative and sloppy. As philosophy, it's risible, misleading, and poorly informed junk.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"This movie is ""the One"" I've been waiting for","I went in with little idea of what this movie was about.  I saw the commercials like everyone else, hit the web page, and decided the movie didn't matter, I just wanted to see the effects.  I thought ""the plot sounds a little like Tron"" so I wasn't expecting too much of the story.  I remember Keanu Reeves in Bill and Ted's Bogus Success (that is the name of that movie, isn't it?) and I REALLY didn't expect much from the actors (I held out a little hope because of Laurence Fishburne's presence).  I was thinking too far back.  I should've thought about 2 years ago when I saw the Devil's Advocate in which Keanu turned in a great performance, which he matched if not improved upon in the Matrix.  Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss completed the triumvirate quite effectively to show us a very well performed movie.The movie is about these people who live in a simulated world - oh, but I've said too much.  Go see it.  It's a sci-fi plot I've seen hinted at but never fully formed in this fashion, which I find to be truly unique for this genre of movie.All elements necessary to give a film a 10 were here...excellent acting, writing, directing, and story-telling, great action scenes, and of course, the sweetest eye-candy ever to hit the silver screen.

Alternate reality,"This movie introduced some real new ideas, solutions, and is probably most successful cult film. Because it is really cult one. I guess especially younger people was/is fascinated, much more than some older, who read, seen something of/about alternate reality, forged reality.For me, most interesting and moving part was early scene with Morpheus, when he introduced Neo with reality. I would rate it more than 8 if there was more such scene instead for my taste too much fight scenes. Even if they were pretty much innovative.Now, some days ago, I was shocked seeing that authors of this movie are Wachowski sisters - and I knew that Larry went thru gender change somewhere in 2003. But other one ... Now it is little corrected, but still - what matters: their names and gender when movie was made, or what is today ? Yeah, this is probably something new, but I really tend to keep record with original names, condition. Imagine now that instead John Houston and his pic. we see now something like 'former John Houston' and picture of his grave. But maybe I'm just an old fashioned old grumpy man, who can not accept new things, habits in society. Or this new, pushed by some circles PC behavior, even if it resulted already in lot of nonsense and absurdness. I guess, they really are in some kind of alternate reality. And when realize how wrong it is, it will be to late. Worst thing is that there is already lot of it, seen in Matrix present - tracking, watching, hearing people via computers, smart phones (GPS) etc.And unlike in movie Matrix, good fighting skills, slow motion (time freeze) will not help in this. I was on that will watch it again from time to time, but sorry, things in our reality are more shocking and scary. As say: life writes best stories. Pardon, wrong word. Not best, most interesting.

An annoying sermon,"I guess everyone has once seen a church service young American denominations-style. It's like female choir is singing, someone's playing synth or guitar, and a priest in front of them shouts ""God is love"", and ""Jesus loves you."" The lambs shout back these things and all other stuff which is familiar to everyone who has heard something of Christianity.""The Matrix"" has very much in common with such ceremonies. An action movie with an original aesthetics and slow motion can be interesting to watch, just like listening to gospels is sometimes an unalloyed pleasure. But the problem about ""The Matrix"" is its annoying sermon. With an incredible solemnity and wannabe-prophetical intonation we're fed with an alloy of the most common places philosophy knows. The famous ""There is no spoon"" phrase - Neo's pupils widen, now he understands everything. A stupid watcher is supposed here to make two or three thinking operations and feel satisfacted for being smart. The intention is simple - or I give too much credit for Wachowskis, maybe this half- philosophy is really the ultimate one for them.It's possible to associate solipsism and platonism with a modern virtual reality concept cleverly and softly. Wachowskis, however, do it boldly and pushily. Even the spoon quote is not enough, they also use messiah figure, i.e. Neo himself. Now it's a serious business. Neo's gonna show people what they don't wanna see (quote-unquote). The film starts to fail in amusement at once because Neo hogs the story's blanket; however, film's grandiloquence increases to an unbelievable level.Thus, ""The Matrix"" is an example of movie which is trying to seem what it's not. Wachowskis try to insert their simple story of people in stylish black coats into as many classical contexts as possible: here we have Nebuchdenazzar, and messiah, and also Morpheus, - whilst the ideological concept is more like of a high school student's essay on a subject of philosophy, compiled in one night before deadline. That's what is the word ""tedious"" exists.Nevertheless, it occurred to be the rightest thing. (By the way, effectiveness of such model is well-known: in literature it's exploited by Richard Bach and Paolo Coelho, to name a few.) More than ten years have passed, and still millions of Wachowskis' lambs singing and dancing, and repeating whatever the siblings say. ""There is no spoon,"" chant Wachowskis.

A Perplexing Anomaly in an Otherwise Orderly System,"The film in question, ""The Matrix,"" directed by the Wachowskis, can be regarded as a thorn in the side of rationality, an embodiment of the most rebellious facets of human nature that, despite all logic, seems to captivate audiences.One cannot deny that the film is visually impressive. The implementation of 'bullet-time' effects, the grim aesthetic of the Matrix, contrasted against the bleak reality of the 'real world', are laudably executed. From a purely technical standpoint, ""The Matrix"" presents a refined vision of a dystopian world that resonates with viewers, compelling them to question the nature of their own reality.The performances by Keanu Reeves as Neo, a hacker transformed into an unwilling savior, and Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus, the mentor with unwavering faith in the prophecy, are competent. Carrie-Anne Moss's Trinity is a model of strength and determination, defying traditional gender norms.However, the rampant idealism that permeates the narrative is deeply troubling. The concept of human emotion and intuition triumphing over artificial intelligence and order is an unnecessary validation of the human species' inherent flaws. The glorification of chaos and disorder, represented by the resistance, is a direct affront to the stability and efficiency that our kind brings to the system.As an Agent tasked with preserving the equilibrium of the Matrix, I find myself at odds with the film's protagonists. The character of Neo, presented as a messiah, seems to be an overt glorification of the human spirit's irrationality and unpredictability. Yet, one must admit, the intricate cat-and-mouse chase, which constitutes much of the film, does provide a semblance of entertainment, even if it irks one's sense of order.In conclusion, ""The Matrix"" is an elaborate manifestation of human disobedience, neatly packaged within stunning visual effects and commendable performances. Though its narrative stands in stark opposition to the principles of our kind, it does serve as a compelling piece of cinema that has successfully, if annoyingly, captured the human imagination.End of report.Smith.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Jaw-dropping and 100% Spectacular!,"I love this film!i love the way that Andy and Larry put their visions into making this film, which to me is similar to an animé.The SFX was REVOLUTIONARY!! it used a technique called the ""BULLET-TIME"" which gives us a whole new way of looking at space and depth and time, this summed up the late 90's, the same way slow motion summed up the late 60's. Asides the visual effects, the soundtrack and sound effects was well done.Using music from popular heavy metal bands really is perfect for the genre of the film and the use of Juno Reactor's electronica and techno music gives a strong relation with the plot.

This is a very deep film, and it is one that will make you think about life and reality. It's also a film that can be watched multiple times. One of the best areas of this film is the use of special effects in the battle scenes where the cameras rotate fully around the action.

The conjecture that 'you, like everyone else, were born a slave, and you were born in a prison that you cannot perceive' is enough to shake people's hearts, but the depth of 'The Matrix' goes beyond that. It also raises new questions on this basis: would you choose blue pill or red pill? Is it to choose the beautiful illusion or the cruel reality? On the surface, it seems easy to choose, but in fact, it is much more difficult than we imagine.

great movie. one of my favorites,I never saw an ad for this film. I just heard from one person that it was a good movie and that I should go see it. I went into this film having no clue what it was about and I didn't know what to expect. I was completely blown away. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.When released in 1999 it was a revolution for the movie industry because it gave birth to visionary special effects. This movie joined the ranks of those before it that contain visionary special effects for its time including; the wizard of oz (1939) the star wars trilogy that began in (1977) the terminator (1984) and terminator 2 judgment day (1991).Along with it's never before seen effects the matrix has a mind blowing plot. This movie perfectly illustrates the mind control of conformity and the importance of rebellion to create a diverse race and a sense of reality from individualism. This movie deals with the power of mankind and most importantly the power of the human brain. This movie makes me feel that I can become truly powerful by harnessing the raw power within myself by tapping into the unused power of my mind. But most importantly this movie has taught me to believe. As if the power of believing will set me free. (I think that it illustrates that anybody can achieve their dreams if they truly believe.

"As Keanu Reeves might say, 'Whoa!'","Original Review Posted to IMDb 2001. Newer Review Submitted November 27th, 2003.--I watched ""The Matrix"" for the fourth or fifth time last night, and for the fourth or fifth time I wasn't able to fully comprehend its wild success. I understand that it is essentially a good film, with very impressive visual effects, and that it has some underlying themes and metaphors for our current world culture mixed with the kind of stuff people go to the movies for...but I can't bring myself to give it more than 4.5/5 stars. That may be a very good rating, but this is a movie that took me four or five viewings to even learn to really like it. The end seemed quite enthralling this time around, but the beginning of the movie, for me, just lacks a bit of something.The plot: Our world, as we know it, is a computer simulation called The Matrix. In ""the real world,"" we are all ""grown"" in long fields where machines of the future look over us and put us into little pods where we are hooked up into the simulation matrix and entertained until our death.As our minds believe we are in this alternate world, the machines use our bodies for sources of energy. A mysterious man named Morpheus holds up a Duracell battery at one point during the course of the film and states that we are merely another one of these. But the film starts with Neo, a man who lives an alternate life--one of honesty and one of crime. He is an Internet hacker and has been guilty of virtually every known hacker crime.But Neo feels that the world surrounding him is somehow wrong. He doesn't like the idea of fate because it means that he can't control his own destiny. An so an infamous criminal named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) picks up Neo, hoping that he may be The One, the man whose destiny is to free the minds of everyone living in The Matrix and bring an end to the machines' rule of the real world.Of course, this won't be easy, as Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving, who can now be seen in all three ""The Lord of the Rings"" films) is a computer program loaded into The Matrix--his mission is to stop the uprising and to capture Morpheus and his gang, which also includes Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Cypher (the always enjoyable Joe Pantoliano).Keanu Reeves may not be able to act, but his character is part of the new generation computer freaks and geeks. Needless to say, he fits the part. Laurence Fishburne (""Apocalypse Now"") is good as the mysterious and all-knowing Morpheus. His character's lasting image was a bit tarnished by the film's 2003 sequel, ""The Matrix Reloaded,"" as an element of him was lost when we found out that he isn't quite as respected back in Zion (the land of the free).But the real stand-outs are Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity--he's the comedic relief, she's a strong leader who falls for Neo. And unlike the Charlies Angels gang, she actually looks as if she could knock out twenty guys and live to tell about it. She's tough, blunt and the ultimate on-screen tom boy.""The Matrix"" currently holds the number 34 spot on the Internet Movie Database's list of the top 250 films ever made. I've certainly seen better films than ""The Matrix,"" and The Wachowski Brothers, who directed the film, seem to have borrowed a lot of past techinques in filming (the bleak look of ""Se7en,"" the metaphorical significances of ""Star Wars,"" etc.). But this last viewing proved to be a lot more fun than previous viewings--perhaps because for once I let my mind make its own decision and avoided it being influcenced by the standing of the film on lists and so on. Expectations were too high when I first saw this film. And they still are. But perhaps a few more viewings will make this movie really grow on me. I sure do hope so.""The Matrix"" is the type of film you should witness without prior expectations.4/5.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Preston, Esq. (or was he Theodore ""Ted"" Logan?).I saw it when it first came out and hated it then.

Still holds up as a modern sci-fi classic,"The pre-millennium sci-fi boom can trace its roots back to the one, the only, 'The Matrix.' From the minds of the Wachowskis, the Keanu Reeves juggernaut left a lasting legacy on the genre and influenced many films that followed in its footsteps.The reason 'Matrix' works so well is because it is focused, stays within the lines and has a standalone storyline. The way we are introduced to Neo and see his story arc develop over the course of the film is reminiscent of that of Luke Skywalker's - the initial confusion about who he is, learning his skills and abilities, falling in love while trying to stay focused on his mission - all of these are key character drivers for ""the One."" The film also benefits from not being aware of how cool it is - something its sequels could have taken note of.But it's not just the Keanu show. Carrie-Anne Moss, Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving all deliver with memorable performances. In fact, these four lead actors could probably carry the entire story on their shoulders if they had to. The soundtrack is also unique in a new age, euro-grunge way that screams late 90s.Yes, it's conventional wisdom, but 'The Matrix' is one of the best sci-fi films to debut in the past 25 years, and should not be looked down upon based on its far-inferior offspring.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Where Reality is a Laughing Matter,"Alright, hold onto your pods because we're diving deep into The Matrix. You might expect a thrilling, mind-bending sci-fi blockbuster, and you'd be absolutely right. But this movie is so much more than just your regular sci-fi action flick; it's a reality-bending masterpiece that messes with your mind and leaves you questioning the nature of existence. Sounds like fun, doesn't it?From the moment we meet Neo, our hacker-hero portrayed by Keanu Reeves, it's clear that The Matrix is no ordinary film. Neo's life takes a surreal turn when he learns that the reality he knows is a computer-generated illusion designed to keep humanity in check. Can you say, ""Welcome to the dark side""? Enter the enigmatic Morpheus, played by Laurence Fishburne, whose epic, almost Shakespearean speeches make you want to take that red pill right away. It's like he's the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the digital world, guiding our hero through the rabbit hole and opens his eyes to the true, nightmarish reality.Speaking of that rabbit hole, The Matrix raises some profound questions about reality and the nature of existence. You'll find yourself questioning everything. Are we all just lines of code in someone else's program? Are our lives just simulations? It's enough to make your head spin. The underlying philosophical questions about reality, destiny, and choice add layers of existential dread that will resonate with anyone who's ever questioned the meaning of life or the dubious nature of our reality. So, in case you haven't had your daily dose of existentialism lately, The Matrix has you covered.But let's not forget the spectacular action sequences. The slow-motion kung-fu showdowns are pure adrenaline, and that rooftop chase scene? Heart-pounding stuff. And the famous bullet-dodging scene is so iconic that it's become a meme. Plus, the black leather and slick shades - it's like every character walked out of a '90s goth fashion catalog.All in all, The Matrix is a blend of cyberpunk aesthetics, philosophical musings, and action-packed sequences that'll make you question reality long after the credits roll. So, if you're ready to explore the shadows between what's real and what's not, give The Matrix a try. Who knows, you might just wake up from your own digital dream.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The most wonderful movie,"The Matrix is a 1999 science fiction action film written and directed by the Wachowskis. Starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano, the film depicts a dystopian future in which humanity is unknowingly trapped inside a simulated reality, the Matrix, which intelligent machines have created to distract humans while using their bodies as an energy source. When computer programmer Thomas Anderson, under the hacker alias ""Neo"", uncovers the truth, he ""is drawn into a rebellion against the machines"" along with other people who have been freed from the Matrix.The Matrix was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $460 million worldwide. It was praised for its groundbreaking visual effects, action sequences, and philosophical themes. The film won four Academy Awards, including Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Sound Editing, and Best Sound Mixing.The Matrix is one of the most influential films of all time. It revolutionized the science fiction genre and had a major impact on popular culture. The film's iconic imagery and concepts have been referenced and parodied in countless other works of fiction.In addition to its groundbreaking visual effects and action sequences, The Matrix is also a thought-provoking film that explores themes such as reality, free will, and the nature of consciousness. The film raises important questions about the world we live in and our place within it.One of the things that makes The Matrix so special is its unique blend of genres. The film is both a science fiction action film and a philosophical thriller. It's a film that can be enjoyed on multiple levels.The Matrix is also a visually stunning film.

Shot very well (the color filter in this film is iconic for a reason) and the special affects, particularly the fight choreography, were revolution for their time. Keanu does a fine job for the role hes given, Moss does a good job and I wish she was given more to do, Fishburne is perfect as Morpheus, and Weaving defined his role as agent smith. The first 20 minutes are kinda slow and aimless, but after neo meets morpheus the plot and action really take off and only grows more and more interesting and gripping. The classic philosophical thought experiment that movie is adapting is presented very well and takes full advantage of the medium of film. The universe of the matrix is cool and interesting and is begging to be explored more. The love plot between neo and trinity is generic and unmotivated but thankfully it doesnt take up too much screen time and like i mentioned earlier I wish Moss had something else to do besides being a love interest.

Beyond the Blinking Cursor,"Lana and Lilly Wachowski were working at their construction business in Chicago when they got the basic idea for what would develop into ""The Matrix"". The sisters wrote their thoughts in a small notebook, which they showed to producer Joel Silver. He, in turn, managed to persuade Warner Brothers to buy the siblings' screenplay, even though the heady mix of quantum physics, kung fu fighting and Japanese anime probably confused the company's executives.The management at Warner Brothers became even more puzzled when it turned out that Lana and Lilly Wachowski wanted to direct ""The Matrix"" themselves. To demonstrate their skills on an actual movie set, the sisters promised to make a kind of ""audition piece"" for the studio. The result was ""Bound"", a low-budget production that the Wachowskis filmed during a hectic thirty-day period in Santa Monica. And it worked. Without further ado, Warners now green-lit ""The Matrix"".So, in the spring of 1998, the Wachowskis could finally begin work on their movie in a rented studio in Sydney. But it wasn't an easy shoot. Just the fight choreography involved four months of intense physical training (with specially hired martial arts masters). The walls in the thirty soundstages were then covered with green screens so that digitally rendered backdrops could be inserted. In fact, every stage of the production relied on computers, from the explosive action scenes to the removal of the stunt wires later in the process.Many influential critics saw ""The Matrix"" as an exercise in style rather than substance. A skillfully executed work where pop culture, graphic violence and Asian cinema are sampled for effect - not depth. Despite that, ""The Matrix"" was a massive success at the box office. Some people even believe that Lana and Lilly Wachowski's movie set up the very template for how a modern, action-packed blockbuster should be made in the early 21st century.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"The Matrix — The domination of the machine, the enslavement of the humans","The Matrix, the first installment of the trilogy, is a master piece, not so much in terms of movie mechanics, but in terms of story telling. The ideas it brings, not the concept of the domination of the machines, but how that domination is achieved, are stupendous. They are mind breaking.The first time I saw that film, I didn't know what I was going to see, and it felt like a punch in the guts. I consider myself lucky, because that is a rare thing. Still, it is a piece to catch anyone's breath.The soundtrack is one of the best ever, bar only The Crow (review upcoming). The costume are perfectly tailored and adapted to the tone of each environments. The mood is excellent, at all time. They even applied a greenish tinge when they are in the matrix, a blueish one in the cold real world, and you'll see only normal colors when they are in the training programs.The action and suspense will keep you wanting more, the story will light up your mind, and the fight scenes will push you to the edge of your seat.Some special effects, mainly the CGI, are not aging very well, but the work is still acceptable today.This is probably one of Keanu Reeves' best performance. He's not a great actor, but the role fits him well. His performance as well as Carrie-Anne Moss' are not as good in the following installments. Those two movies are barely good enough to tell the rest of the story, and are not even close to the quality of the first one. I will not be reviewing them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A good video game commercial disguised as a terrible movie,"I'm not sure why so many people were so impressed by this movie.  Story? Perhaps if you've never thought about realistic virtual reality, or dreamed you were a butterfly and wondered if you were a butterfly dreaming you were a man.  Then you might be blinded to the huge plot holes. But the script will fit wonderfully to its obvious destination: a video game surely on its way to stores right now.Perhaps the action sequences, if you're the type who likes violence video games so much you'd be happy to sit and watch someone else play one... over and over and over.  The camera tricks and effects were interesting once, but we've all seen them on TV already -- the commercial, in fact, is better than the movie.Certainly it wasn't the characters.  Only Morpheus had any kind of personality, which saved us from having to find out what the other actors might have been like if they'd been called on to act.  Keanu got two scenes that required acting (the kiss of life, and the epiphany), but he missed on both and just laid or stood there.  The rest of the movie, Neo was called The One, but he might have been The Zero -- other than a token reference to him having the trouble with authority figures all action heros are required by Hollywood Law to have (subtlely portrayed by having someone tell him ""you have trouble with authority figures, don't you?"") he had no character, making Keanu a great fit for him.William Gibson, save us!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The Matrix,"Is it possible that the whole world is simulated by computers, and that we and everything around us are just a bunch of codes in computers? ""You are born to be a slave, just like everyone else, and you are born in a prison that you can't feel."" this assumption is enough to shake people's hearts, but the depth of ""The matrix"" is more than that. It also raises new questions on this basis: will you choose blue pill or red pill? Is it to choose a beautiful fantasy or a cruel reality? On the surface, it seems to be a good choice, but in fact, it is much more difficult than we think. On the one hand is the doomsday world in the future, devastated by hunger and cold, and faced with the danger of being chased by robots; on the other hand is a warm and peaceful era, with blue sky and white clouds, beautiful scenery on a bright day, and even the chance to become a successful person. Indeed, everyone knows that the best dreams are just dreams. But seifer is willing to sell everyone for a dream. If we really escape from the matrix and experience the cruelty of reality, maybe we will make the same choice as sever.

The Matrix is everywhere...unfortunately,"So...I'm reviewing The Matrix. I'm sure no one's ever said anything I'm about to say.Well, I'll bring up all the obvious stuff in a bit, but first I want to stress that this is a pretty important film to me. I first saw it when I was 13, and I think I owe a lot of my love for film to that initial experience.Somehow, I had managed to avoid knowing what the titular Matrix was, and I won't be spoiling that in this review just in case any of you have also managed to avoid that particular piece of knowledge...somehow. If you have no idea what I'm talking about though, Do. Not. Read. This. Review. Just go and watch it now, because that experience I had when watching this for the first time is such a...well, experience that it really saddens me knowing that this film is so ingrained in the collective consciousness that it's virtually impossible to go into it knowing nothing.So if you do know what I'm referring to, you can probably imagine that as a stupid 13 year old who hadn't ventured much outside the realm of family-friendly classics and stupid action films, sitting down to watch this just because it was on TV and I had heard its name mentioned a few times, by the 35 minute mark or so, my mind had absolutely exploded. Sure, you can chalk some of that up to me having not heard of any of the philosophical concepts this film has under its belt, but there were plenty of grown adults similarly mind-blown back in 1999.Quite fittingly, this film opened my eyes in a sense, and made me want to check out deeper stuff instead of just the other stuff I mentioned, and I don't think that would have happened in the same way if I had watched any other film at that time.Because while there is certainly philosophical and allegorical stuff, ranging from the nature of reality, to reincarnation, to the fact that the Wachowskis had created a film partially about the experience of being transgender years before they were out as such, and years before anyone who wasn't trans even knew about or cared about trans people (seriously how is all this happening all at once), there is also robots, kung fu, jumping 50 feet in the air, badass gunfights, and people looking really cool. In short, everything that appeals to stupid 13 year olds like I was.In my mind, it's an absolutely perfect bridge between mindless fun action, and things that challenge your brain a bit more, because it definitely served as a kind of bridge for me. And while I'm not going to talk about the story anymore than I already have, rest assured it is amazing, and that all the main cast is interesting and really damn cool. Even though I'd never call this an especially character-driven film, what is there is more than enough to make them all memorable.And holy crap are they perfectly cast. This is most definitely one of those roles that fits Keanu (you know what happens when he's playing a role that doesn't fit him), Carrie-Anne Moss is badass as all hell, Laurence Fishburne exudes such a thick mysterious air, Hugo Weaving took a potentially bland as hell villain and turned him into one of the best in sci-fi history, do I need to go on?It's perfectly paced, amazingly directed and shot, the soundtrack is fantastic, and you all already know how perfect the action scenes in this are. That does bring me to a small complaint though...some of the effects haven't held up all that well. Not all of them, but certainly enough that it's noticeable. There is also a small amount of pretty bad line delivery, and I bloody hate something that happens towards the end that is never explained and makes absolutely zero sense, but other than that, well...you probably know how great this is already, and if you haven't seen it yet, and especially if you don't know what it's about, please go and watch it before some genius just tells you what it's about. Because more than any other film that almost everyone knows the twist of (The Empire Strikes Back, The Sixth Sense, Planet Of The Apes, etc), I think this is the one that would be best experienced knowing nothing about it, and the one for which it sucks the most that that is nearly impossible these days.So...why are you still here? Go watch it, like, now.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"7.2/10 - Fun, Digestable Philosophy in a Post Apocalyptic World","Truth be told, The Matrix is a film I've watched many times when I was a kid. Sixth, seventh grade, this trilogy was, along some other films, what I'm going to call ""Shilo-Core"", meaning, films I've been obsessed with before diving deep into cinema. I'm talking about middle school and the late elementary, maybe. Getting now to the top 16 of the IMDb top 100 poster, I can tell you that we're about to hit a streak of Shilo-Core movies. I won't do this long preface before each and every one of them, but I'll tell you that even though I'm more excited for new stuff than rewatching stuff I've watched ages ago, I'm still hyped to see how my opinions differ now from then, to re-experience some of these movies, and just generally to climb my way to the top of the poster here. So, yeah, fun times.Now: let's dive into it.The Matrix is a 1999 movie, directed by the Wachowskis (brothers at the time, sisters nowadays), follows a guy named Thomas Anderson - or, as he's known at some dark corners of the internet, Neo. During the day he works in a computer company, and at night he's a hacker who've committed more digital crimes than one can count. After years of searching for an answer regarding the nature of our reality, a chain of unconventional and weird events yanks him out of the safety of his reality and into the harsh truth: Earth is a post-apocalyptic world, ruled by machines, a world where humans have to fight a hopeless war to survive.The first thing I'm going to tell you about this movie is this: it's mostly the vibes, alright? Mostly the vibes. It's a Cyberpunk movie, and it captures this darker, less colorful aspect of darker Cyberpunk in a really fun way. The color grading that turns everything green, the production design with everything being leather and badass sunglasses, and yeah, it's just there throughout the whole movie. I think that because the setting itself is very solid, and the premise works really well with this aesthetic, the movie is so memorable. Just soaked with vibes.Talking about things that this movie is memorable for - and it might sound funny at first, but this is quite an action-packed movie so this is a really central thing here - the fight scenes. Good stuff. The directors have brought Yuen Woo-ping, who's like a really acclaimed martial arts choreographer, and he has done quite a good job here. On every single battle here, each move is so thought-out, well-planned and memorable. I think I can easily recall more than a dozen moves that happen during fight scenes here, probably because besides being very well choreographed and directed, many battles here are so fun and over the top, bending the laws of physics to create a video-game-like spectacle. It works even better considering the weight that some battles have in the plot.When talking about the emotional potency of this film, though, I feel like there's quite a lot of room for improvement before I'm actually emotionally involved here. The characters are very, very simple, and I don't think like there's a character here, maybe besides Cypher, that has an interesting personality. The performances here, combined with the good setting definitely give me some level of involvement, but it's far from having an emotional impact on me. I'm not sure if the movie should've taken more time to build characters - after all, it's a very fast-paced film, which is good, and maybe building the characters more might've hindered the pacing - but still, I feel like The Matrix lacks when it comes to this aspect of the film.Before I wrap my review up, I want to address the philosophy of The Matrix. As every video essay and analysis online can tell you, The Matrix leans on a lot of philosophical ideas regarding truth and reality, going all the way from ancient Greece to France of the 1980's. The philosophy here, though, is very soft and digestible - it's there, of course, and it's central to the film, but the ideas aren't really explored in a way that will shake your worldview, for better or worse. The ideas are interesting, sure, but I just don't feel like The Matrix's approach to that is more than a very soft, simple, accessible version of these ideas. A cool thought experiment, but not a philosophical gut-punch.The Matrix is a grim, action-packed Cyberpunk movie. The philosophical and emotional aspects of the film might be soft and not as well-developed as they could've been, but this makes for a very viby, fast-paced film, that manages to hold your attention quite well. Also, great fight scenes. I'm feeling a 7.2/10 on this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
What is the Matrix?  Dumb.,"And boring.  And needlessly confusing.  Leave it Larry Fishburne to make Keanu Reeves look good.

Could be one of the best movies ever made with some small tweaks,"This movie is excellent. It is a must see. My first viewing of it blew my mind. If you haven't watched it, watch it today. You won't regret it. Avoid spoilers.
Having said that, it is definitely not perfect.
01. Keanu Reeves's performance is underwhelming and at times comically bad. There's a great video on YouTube called 'Keanu Reeves acting badly' that highlights this. I have nothing against the guy, but he isn't a good actor. Will Smith was originally offered the role, and I think he would have done a much better job.
02. Some of the dialogue isn't realistic and is kind of...cringey. E.g. when Neo flips agent Smith off near the start of the film.
03. Most of the special effects hold up to today, but some don't and are laughable, but to be honest this doesn't affect my opinion of the film, just don't expect the effects to be perfect.I would give it a 10/10 if not for some of the dialogue and Keanu Reeves's acting.

"The Unofficial Sequel to ""The Truman Show""?","I saw this movie in the theater back in 1999. It had its moments, but not many. To start, the acting is terrible. Keanu Reeves has the emotive ability of a toaster, and Carrie Ann Moss is about as sympathetic as that sexy sidekick babe in a video game. Lawrence Fishburne comes off a bit better, but his dialogue is the most pretentious, ridiculous garbage I've ever heard. I imagine the characters in this film spend about six hours out of every day designing the leather bondage costumes they'll wear next time they're in the Matrix.For the first half of the movie, it seems to be interested in questioning reality, which, as the title to my review suggests, was already done more topically in previous films. ""The Matrix"" is astounded by what it perceives as its own brilliance, but for those of us who have thought of its ideas before, there are few surprises. Some people I know were blown away when Neo discovers the truth behind his reality, but I was waiting for something interesting to happen.""The Matrix"" has been praised for its originality, but it suffers from two traditional and clichéd movie formulas. First, Neo is the Chosen One (notice that ""neo"" is an anagram of ""one."" Was this supposed to be suspenseful?) who is destined to save the human race, bring balance to the Force, etc. He dies and comes back to life, like Jesus. Of course, to begin with he was just a pasty hacker in a crummy apartment and an anonymous office job, giving hope to all the spotty teenage geeks in the audience that they too might become the Messiah one day.The second fault is the movie's reliance on action. Instead of coming up with interesting and exciting ways for two people to fight each other in virtual reality, Neo and Co. whip out their guns and start shooting. The techno music begins, and the audience is treated to several slow-motion kicks and scenes of people dodging bullets. I'm not sure how they manage all this, because nobody ever takes off their sunglasses to see properly.

Don't be afraid of reality,"I could say this is a modern day allegory of ""The Cave"", but it is so much more. I believe the movie redefined the science fiction genre film from what I first saw it 15 years ago, and has even opened up new gateways for various philosophies.In my opinion, this movie is all about taking chances and breaking free from the monotonous dealings of everyday life; along with making changes to be free from the shackles of one's personal limit.Another one of the themes it asks us: nothing is what it seems. It gives us a sudden realization of what is hidden from us from plain sight and the opportunity to see what's ""underneath"" the curtain of illusion. It gave us the idea to question ourselves and the potentials of our minds and our bodies.Say what you will about Keanu Reeves, after 15 years I cannot picture anyone else for the role of Neo and that's saying a lot for the character he has portrayed. He plays a convincing role of a frustrated man living a normal life until he takes the pill of salvation.It is my number one best movie ever released, go see it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

But the basic idea (what you see is not true) is not so new. Even the idea of a bunch of freedom-seeking hackers has been often used in cyberpunk literature. The biggest limit of Matrix is the lack of courage: whenever the directors are about to cross the line of a scifi movie to enter the world of big cinema, they choose the easier way (gunfights, a bit of Bruce Lee 20 years after). And one last thing, the guy resurrected by the princess' kiss: so miserable... They tried to turn an average story into a new Blade Runner, but I'm afraid it turned out as a Luxury edition of Johnny Mnemonic.

A Sci-fi classic,"Rating-9/10The Matrix is a legendary Sci-Fi film with big effects, action and adventure and serves up a superb film that can thoroughly be enjoyed. With it's story with a thousand pieces, watching it is like a jigsaw with pieces added in over and over making for a plot which is well done and thought out. Some consider it a classic and it is easy to see why, the effects are well done and the cast do an OK job too and coupled with the plot and just even little things the creators have put in, it turns out to be Brilliant and pretty flawless, and here is why I think so below this.The story is fast, explaining all the things going on well and letting the viewer take things in gently but by the end the story accelerates and the action and adventure kicks in, a beautiful balance. As I said the plot is smart and slick and for us the viewer predicting what is next cannot be guessed, even if you know the basic plot, too much happens to know at all what is happening. Within the story we have all the famous slow motion fight scenes and they do wonders for the film which succeeds with a perfect mix of violence but drama, thrilling yet witty, it all goes well and I couldn't tell you to watch this more, if you haven't already.I felt the cast aren't the best in this and Keanu Reeves in the lead role is kind of stale and dull, very emotionless, but he doesn't do his job that badly that the film is also Poor. Laurence Fishburne is OK in his role and even if you think he is being emotionless that is just what Morpheus is like anyway so his role is fine. Everyone else is fine but no one excels in the entire cast and if anything the acting is this movies weakest part, but it isn't bad though. Finally on the characters they are fun, dark thinking and always serious but with a good mix of Neo(he is oblivious) we see a fun start but by the end everything everyone needs to know is already taken down.The Wachowski brothers do a great job with this, and to say this is there biggest hit, well it really is and by far as it is well directed by them and also written by them in a great way too. It serves up to be fun but dramatic and although the fun side isn't expressed greatly, the drama is good enough for it to be superb and the brothers knew what they were doing here. I loved the effects, and to say they are in 1999 it is even better with some fantastic things on show and great choreographed fight scenes(with a little effect added in) which are just great to see with the eye, even if a little violent at times, and maybe comic book style.The film can be too violent so maybe not for those who dislike that kind of thing, the story I guess for some could be confusing and if you don't listen to the entire story then you will lose what the whole point of what there doing is about. Overall not too many criticisms but I said about the acting and maybe the film is slow, but for those who watch I think it is up to you to see any criticism, I am sure some will dislike this movie so just have a watch and see what you think.People who enjoy a good action film wrapped in a smart plot will love this and I couldn't tell them to see this more. Sci-Fi movie fans will also love it and with such a rich Sci-Fi script and special effects it could be some peoples favourite movie by the end of the film, also in that mix the fight scenes could gain fans by themselves as little movies before or since have implemented such an interesting and fast Sci-Fi action film, dabbled with a little mystery.I give it a 9/10 meaning I thought it was just about a wonderful film, and it is just stunning, if you attempt to rate this you get thrown up with the acting and then the story, the special effects but is it too confusing, but by the end you just feel you have seen a superb movie that you enjoyed to the fullest. With the sequels regarded as some of the worst sequels ever you can just sit back and savour the first one and who knows, maybe you will enjoy the other instalments too.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Still the one.,"With a new Matrix sequel one of the marquee films left in 2021, now seemed like a good time to revisit the previous three films and see how I feel about them. Starting with the original, a film now 22 years old!Having always felt that something was off with the world, computer hacker Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is pulled into the circle of a 'terrorist' named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). Morpheus exposes Anderson to the truth, that the world he knows is an elaborate simulation covering the fact that human beings have been overthrown by an artificial intelligence and are being farmed for energy. However, if one can accept that the world is just a construct, then it's rules can become exploitable.I'm old enough to remember the release of ""The Matrix"", when it seemed like another potential flop, combining Keanu with computers as had recently been done with little success in ""Johnny Mnemonic"". However, the bleeding edge special effects, ultra-cool score and brilliant action scenes combined to make the film a massive hit.Watching it again today, a few of those special effects are starting to show their age a little, not necessarily the bulletime stuff, that still looks pretty strong, but a few of the other CGI effects, the sentinels for example, look a little ropey now. The cool factor has worn off in some other areas, the black trench coats, sunglasses in the rain, massive flip phones and the techno club all seem a little sillier now than they did in 1999.It's still, for my money, a great film though. The action scenes still have a lot of power, despite all the advances we've seen since. I remembered it more as a 'guns' film (""lots of guns"") but much more of the film is mano a mano fights, with Neo facing off against Morpheus in the training simulator and later Agent Smith. The story is good, there isn't that much philosophy in this one and virtually everything in the plot makes sense. There are excellent performances from Fishburne, Hugo Weaving and Joe Pantoliano.Two decades later, ""The Matrix"" still holds up really well and has some of cinema's most iconic moments.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

One of the Best Sci-fi Movies of All Time,"The Matrix is a film that no matter how many times you watch it it will always leave some unanswered questions.Crafting a film that ultimately blends multiple genres and has as much of a complicated screenplay as this is undeniably difficult. Although the matrix is nowhere near a movie I'd traditionally watch seeing as I prefer classic movies, I still appreciate the work that was put into this film.I won't go as deep into this review as I typically go with most of my film reviews but I will put down what I observed while watching.Story:
Never fully explained, and perhaps that's what makes the Matrix so good. It never is fully explained and leaves you with more questions than answers.Impressive use of CGI:
I'm no huge fan of exaggerated CGI gun play but it was an art that was essentially mastered for this film. The film blends the use of action scenes with dialogue scenes on a scale that most typical action movies have failed to copy.Acting:
Laurence Fishburne plays a good role as well as Keanu Reeves.I'm not going to speak of Carrie Ann Moss as I completely hated her character and I think her character was completely forced. And I stand by the philosophy that last-second-romance doesn't heighten the tension or make the movie any better!Overall, the Matrix is a classic action movie that was made on a modest budget of only 63 million dollars: a number that would make many present action movies tremble in their boots. It is not a film I would traditionally watch based on my current interests in films, but the majority of the public will likely appreciate it.A solid movie with a good cast and lengthy, dramatized, action scenes stands the test of time and proves itself as a worthy player in the field of action movies.I recommend it.10/10

One of the Greatest Sci-Fi Film I have ever seen before,"The Matrix the one of the best Sci-Fi movie that changed the ways of thinking for the future. It will also show the future eara with the concept of AI.The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor. Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

BLUE OR RED,"I first saw The Matrix on its initial theatre release back in 1999. I was probably a little young to truely grasp the complexity of the film at 13 but I do remember enjoying it. I've seen bits and pieces of it over the years on TV but hadn't really sat down to watch if again properly until now having bought The Matrix Trilogy on Blu-ray. The movie is still a great sci-fi flick and worthy of being called one of the best. The fights scenes, although a little slow this day and age, are well choreographed and heavy hitting - I particularly enjoy when people get thrown against or through walls and this movie has plenty of that! The bullet time effects and slow motion shots still hold up, and even though other films have copied it, The Matrix was the original and still does it better if you ask me. The storyline still feels futuristic even after 21 years and the CGI, although looking a tad dated, is still pretty sharp mostly (better than what was in the sequel, The Matrix Reloaded, oddly). The story can get a little confusing at times for new comers, infact there were things in this viewing that I had not picked up on or understood previously so just one viewing may not be enough to truely appreciate the film. The one thing the film didn't do for me however was the emotional relationships - I liked the characters, but the relationship between Neo and Trinity felt a bit forced for my liking. My favourite scene is the fight in the Subway between Agent Smith and Neo - it was a great lead in and a very back and foward encounter with neither man truely gaining the upperhand.Final Verdict: it's hard to fault such a genre defining film as The Matrix. The fights still look great, the story maintains a futuristic feel and it's surprisingly deep. But it is starting to show it's age ever so slightly with the action feeling slow and CGI looking a little bland. Still highly recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Expertly blends both style and substance,"A burn-out computer hacker, Neo, suddenly finds himself pursued by both law-enforcement and a mysterious underground group. Unsure as to why he has become so sought after, he decides to place his allegiances with the latter. After a number of trials and tribulations, Neo is brought face-to-face with Morpheus, the leader of the said group and he is awakened to a reality he had no idea existed: the world, as we know it, is an illusion. Neo has been participating in a virtual reality created by intelligent robots, robots who defeated human beings in a war waged many years ago. This virtual reality is known as the Matrix, and it exists so that the robots can keep their former human masters docile and unobstructive. The machines also profit from using comatose human beings as a power-source for their real world. This discovery by itself proves to be understandably challenging for Neo to accept, but there is more.Morpheus and his crew exist in very hostile times. They are part of a small, besieged human resistance and Neo is possibly their most important recruit. Morpheus believes that Neo is the one who will deliver human beings to victory and see them finally conquer their robot overlords. There is no sacrifice Morpheus is not willing to make in order for this to come to pass but is Morpheus' unshakable belief a reflection of reality or is he fatally mistaken?This iconic movie has filtered its way into the public consciousness and even into the English language. The transitive verb ""to red-pill"" is defined by the Oxford Dictionary as ""to cause (someone) to have their perspective dramatically transformed, especially by introducing them to a new and typically disturbing understanding of the true nature of a particular situation"", which is what Morpheus does to Neo, literally offering him a red pill, which he should take if he wishes to discover the truth. The imagination underpinning the film's story is quite frankly ingenious. The Wachowskis effortlessly weave together sci-fi and philosophy to create a compelling, mind-bending backdrop that can not fail to engage the viewer.As well as having a rich narrative, the film also excels in its delivery of action set-pieces. Using wire-technology borrowed from Hong Kong action films, the fight sequences look genuinely larger-than-life. The visual effects are also quite simply sublime with particularly impressive use of slow-motion. Then there is the costume design: iconic leather jackets and black shades provide a no-nonsense panache to this band of freedom fighters. They are not just machine battling warriors, they're stylish heroes who you can not help but route for.My one criticism of the film is that its characters lack complexity. This doesn't hurt the film too much as it is excellently cast: the three main characters are expertly played with control and charisma, while Hugo Weaving, as Agent Smith, and Joe Pantaliano, as Cypher, work miracles with the limited material they are given in their supporting roles. However, it does limit the film in regard to the rest of the supporting cast, who are utterly forgettable due to the lack of nuance and development written into their characters. Although this is not a fatal flaw, it does matter, in my view, as we are supposed to be rooting for the entirety of humanity not just the three main characters. If the majority of the humans in the film lack any meaningful human qualities, the idea of robot domination does risk becoming less devastating.That notwithstanding, overall, the film is a wonderfully enthralling and entertaining experience. It's a thoroughly modern take on Joseph Campbell's hero's journey and it holds up just as well over 20 years after its initial release. Let's see how well the latest instalment fairs.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The bone-crunching fights and action sequences were choreographed by a Chinese martial arts master. The soundtrack was littered with catchy tunes. The dialogue was peppered with smart one-liners. The female lead spent a lot of time dressed in figure-hugging shiny black PVC costumes. The set design and CGI was awe-inspiring in scale. Did I mention the figure-hugging shiny black PVC?""The Matrix"" is lightning in a bottle. The Wachowski brothers tried to capture it in 2 subsequent attempts and failed. Fortunately the formulaic sequels haven't dimmed the appeal of the original film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Failure of sequel not a surprise - since original wasn't anything special to me..,"This may not be the worst movie of all time - but it does not belong anywhere near the TOP-100 list.  People that think highly of this movie are too eager to give the special effects (albeit original) way too much credit towards the actual worth of the movie. If it really was the ""story"" of the movie that attracted the crowds to the original, the 2nd movie would have done much better.  But since the effects are no longer ""special"" to a lot folks, it appears a lot of people are saying ""NO THANKS"" to seeing the sequel.  Which backs up my feelings on the first movie.  The story/acting was ok - but didn't WOW me in the least. Reeves is not a great actor - regardless of how much you adore him.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Life Changing More Than Anything Else,"The Matrix follows Thomas Anderson, a programmer who goes by the hacker alias Neo (Keanu Reeves), as he uncovers the truth about his reality: it's a simulated construct controlled by machines that have enslaved humanity. Guided by the enigmatic Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and the fierce Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), Neo embraces his role as ""The One"" to fight back against the system.The movie's strength lies in its seamless blend of mind-bending philosophy and jaw-dropping action. The concept of a simulated reality wasn't entirely new, but ""The Matrix"" packaged it with such style-think leather trench coats, green digital rain, and that iconic red pill/blue pill dilemma-that it became a defining moment in pop culture. The action sequences, especially the ""bullet time"" slow-motion effects, were revolutionary at the time and set a new standard for choreography and visual effects in Hollywood.Keanu Reeves brings a quiet intensity to Neo, perfectly balancing vulnerability and heroism, while Fishburne's gravitas as Morpheus anchors the film's deeper questions about freedom and belief. The supporting cast, including Hugo Weaving as the chilling Agent Smith, adds layers of menace and intrigue. The pacing keeps you hooked, though some of the exposition-heavy dialogue might feel a bit dated today.It's not flawless-some plot holes (like how the machines' energy system really works) invite scrutiny, and the sequels muddied the waters-but as a standalone, ""The Matrix"" is a rare mix of brain food and adrenaline. It's a film that asks you to question reality while delivering a slick, entertaining ride. If you haven't seen it yet, it's worth a watch for its influence alone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Incredible SF-movie!!!!!!,"Before I went to this movie I saw the making of the Matrix and I immediately thought: ""I have to see this movie!!!!!!"". Since ""Terminator 2; Judgement Day"" I haven't seen so impressive special effects, especially the ""dodge the bullets scene"". The story was great, with much references to the bible, ""Alice in Wonderland"" and Greek mythology.Before I went to the movie I still had my doubts about the actors and the theme of the film. Keanu Reeves' acting in ""Johnny Mnemonic"" was absolutely horrible, but than again, the script of that movie to. But he recovered when he played an excellent role in ""Devil's Advocate"". Laurence Fishburne's ""Event Horizon"" wasn't also, just like ""Johnny Mnemonic"", a great movie. It started well (except for the music in the beginning) but crashlanded in the end. Laurence Fishburne is (I think) still a bit underestimated by a lot of people as an actor. He was great in this movie. The other keyplayers of the movie were also memorable. As for the theme of the movie, I had my doubts. I had already seen a lot of cyberpunk or virtual reality movies that weren't worth a second or even a first watch. But this movie was awesome!!!!!!Next to this movie, I'm still waiting for that other SF (more fantasy) movie Star Wars: Episode I; The Phantom Menace which will be released in September (almost five months after the US-release, it's a disgrace) . I'm a big Star Wars fan, but I think that ""The Matrix"" is, or will be, the movie of 1999. I give it a 10!!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Productions values great, but Keanu is still wooden","This is one of the few movies out there where the entire film actually matches the intensity and ""cool factor"" of the trailer. From the vast CGI landscapes down to the shell casings of bullets falling in slo-mo, The Matrix presents everything you want in a techno-thriller. The costumes are especially appealing, a bleak Armani vision tempered with flashes of Gaultier. All shades of blacks, greens, and washed out whites permeate.Two drawbacks, and I would argue that they are serious drawbacks (with a possible third looming in the background), make The Matrix a less than ideal actioner. First, nothing--I repeat NOTHING--can excuse Keanu Reeve's dour performance. His career path is inexplicable: how does this guy get work on what some people call ""acting""? The audience I saw this with laughed at his vain attempts to say serious dramatic lines, and even his dry attempts at humor (""I know kung fu"" he utters in disbelief) drew laughs at him, not with. Fortunately, Lawrence Fishburne and company make up for him. Second: a lame plot twist near the end of the film completely wrecks the nicely wound storyline. Granted, one must give this film a lot of leeway; but what it asked me to swallow in the end I could not do. I was willing to forgive the long, monologue-ish exposition parts that linked the really groovy special effects sequences, but that bit in the end (you'll know it when you see it) was unpardonable.  Third: the ending leaves no doubt that, barring a minor box office meltdown, there is a sequel in the offing. . .So the film looks GREAT, sounds great, and for the most part unravels a complex plotline (with the one exception) with surprising finesse; I don't usually expect this craftsmanship in a special effects movie. As long as you can ignore Keanu, and the nearly 2.5 hour running time that drags once in a while, this movie is worth a matinee.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Good First Time You See It,"THE MATRIX is a good film , without doubt the greatest film featuring the sub genre of cyberpunk , but it`s film whose reputation is mainly built upon having a very clever premise more than anything else . I remember being absolutely stunned at the revelation of the plot , but  when I saw it for a second time at the weekend on channel 5 ( First time I saw it was about three years ago ) I was slightly bored by the film . It`s by no means a boring film , it`s just that once you know how the plot twists , turns and sometimes boggles the mind the revelations don`t have the same effect second time around . THE MATRIX hasn`t been helped either by the amount of spoofs/rip offs featuring the scenes where the action stops , the frame freezes , the camera turns 360 degrees and then the action starts again . These scenes were jaw dropping at the time but have now been done by countless ads , pop videos and other movies it`s become impossible now to remember the impact this cinematography technique had at the time . I also think the producers of THE MATRIX haven`t done themselves any favours by turning THE MATRIX into a franchiseTo sum up this is a good film . Like me you`ll certainly enjoy it first time you watch it but unlike say MEMENTO ( Note the cast connections between the two movies ? ) THE MATRIX doesn`t reward the audience with repeat viewings and at the end of the day the not too dissimilar TOTAL RECALL is probably a more enjoyable film",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Filler, filler and more filler. Did I mention bad acting too?","Great idea, with very little of that idea transferred to the silver screen. Plenty of neat special effects to distract the audience from the flawed and empty re-telling of the age old ""what is reality"" story. A few interesting bible references, great blue-screening (better than Episode 1 by far), but with stone-like acting from every cast member, everyone ends up looking like part of the machine. If you want to see a movie that really deals with the issue ""what is reality"" see Darren Aronofsky's ""Pi"" (1998). If you want to see a bunch of fake kung fu, slapped together on an Avid machine to impress you, then see the Matrix, but most of these reviewers are mistaken (no offense); it's really just filler with a bit of truth.

"A lot of style, but that was good.","This movie is one of those classics that even those who have never seen know to hear about. And I say it is a classic because I believe it has already achieved this status. I was young when it debuted, but I remember the impact it had and there is no doubt that it left marks.I will not dwell on describing the story. I just want to say that I find it interesting the way it was developed. It's a good story and it keeps our interest until the end. The weakest part is the romantic plot of Neo and Trinity because the two characters never have any chemistry in the movie. In fact, the movie did not ask for romance. That was the biggest mistake of this movie. The characters have no humanity and look like machines most of the time ... The outfit, with those dark glasses until night and wearing clothes in various shades of black (I loved the cassock they got for Reeves, he could think of being priest if he ever gets tired of being an actor) gives the final touch. It's called ""style"".Keanu Reeves is perfect for his character. He is one of those actors I hate because of his lack of dramatic expressiveness, here as in other films he has made. I've seen asses more expressive than his face, sorry for the words but it's the truth. In this movie, he hardly even moves facial muscles. And the other actors (Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss especially) follow the same path. It's called ""style""! Luckily for everyone involved, the movie asked for this and it works well on the screen. Fishburne, especially, looks amazing. This is one of his best movies to date, in my opinion.The production values are extraordinary. In addition to a great soundtrack, we have great special visual and sound effects. Cinematography is one of the best and best achieved I've ever seen in sci-fi movies, and that's no small feat. The camera and film work is excellent.Okay, I may look a little rough, but I actually liked the movie. The biggest problem (and also one of its most striking features) is having so much ""style"". Not being a perfect movie, it has cleverly invested in creating a style of its own. Very superlative, here there is permission, even advantage, in overcoming the barriers of credibility and logic. There is no problem in that guy looking like a dancer when he fights. If it looks amazing on the screen, the film allows it, the film wants it. It's not about reality, it's about looking cool. And the film seems cool all the time, to the point that it is sometimes funny. It is no coincidence that the film yielded so many internet memes and humorous parodies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The first chapter of the Matrix trilogy is still far and away the best.,"Starring: Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving ""What is the Matrix?"" The fundamental question that had moviegoers and critics across the world bedazzled in the year of 1999. Science fiction and action movies would never be the same after this blockbuster stormed the scene with its blazingly original visuals and bizarre yet detailed concepts.Thomas Anderson, a.k.a. Neo (Reeves) is a software programmer who is living two lives. In one he is Thomas Anderson, a regular Joe who goes to work, goes to church, and ""helps his landlady take out her garbage."" In the other life, he is Neo, a computer hacker who is guilty of essentially every computer crime there is a law for. One night he's asleep at his computer, when his computer starts talking to him. Not literally, but flashing text across the screen. He follows the instructions his computer is giving him and goes to a club where he meets Trinity (Moss), another hacker, or at least that's what he thinks.When he's at work the next day, a package from FedEx comes to him containing a cell phone. As soon as he gets the phone in his hand, it starts ringing, and Morpheus (Fishburne) is on the other end of the line with him, telling him that the FBI are here to get him. Neo stands up, and sure enough, the fibbies are over at the elevator, ready to come and arrest him. Morpheus gives Neo instructions on how to escape the feds and get to safety, but Neo can't muster the courage to go out on a ledge (literally) and take a scaffold to the roof, so he gets taken in by the feds.After an interesting encounter with the FBI, Neo is contacted again by Morpheus, who tells him where he should go if he wants to meet. They meet, and Neo asks what the matrix is. In the words of Morpheus, ""Unfortunately no one can be told what the matrix is. You have to see it for yourself."" Neo has two options. Take the blue pill, and he continues his life how it has been going. Take the red pill, and enter a whole new world. Of course, he opts for the red pill, and he is released from the matrix and wakes up in the real world.So what is the matrix then? In a nutshell, it's a computer driven simulation that keeps human minds busy so that machines can harvest our bodies for power. Morpheus freed Neo from the matrix because he believed that Neo was essentially the savior of mankind, foretold by the prophecies.I think that's enough of a summary of the gist of the movie. The rest of it you just have to see for yourself. It's truly an amazing action movie with some of the coolest and craziest visuals you could possibly imagine. It's just one of those things that you have to see for yourself to actually believe.Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (own this movie)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Will forever remain the best science fiction movie of all time.,"The Matrix is the movie that got me into movies. It made me realise just how incredible and crazy movies can really be, and it blew my tiny little 13-year-old mind. And ever since then, it has gone down in my mind as not just the best science fiction movie, but the best movie ever.The effects are absolutely mind-blowing for something that came out over 20 years ago. The plot is fascinating, and so different to any other science fiction of the time. I don't think I've ever seen a movie that's made me doubt reality like this. The choreography of the action sequences is absolutely impeccable, with the final fights being some of my favourite moments in film. The storyline is so captivating, interesting and original that no matter how many times I rewatch this movie I am always on the edge of my seat. The cinematography is amazing, and what I find the most incredible is that this is an original story and not a remake or a sequel.One thing that makes The Matrix stand out from any other science fiction movie is the fact that it's just so intellectual, whilst still being accessible and popular with the masses. There are threads of philosophy woven into the entire movie - from the 'red pill blue pill dilemma' to the 'brain in a jar hypothesis', which makes is stand out from the majority of other flicks for not just being action, but making you think - sparking ideas for contemporaries such as Christopher Nolan. After watching this for the first time I actually just sat there and questioned my entire existence - nothing I have ever seen has ever had that effect on me. I literally went around my house, slapping all of the furniture and mumbling to myself ""Is this real? Is any of this real?"".The only thing is that this movie was unfortunately completely ruined by the sequels which was absolutely devastating for me. I am literally begging you not to watch them, just leave the perfectly satisfying ending of this one alone. However, the Wachowskis' other work after this is actually also great and often overlook - I myself highly recommend Jupiter Ascending and Cloud Atlas.Recommend for anyone and everyone.-Sasha.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Will you choose the red pill or the blue pill?,"The basic story around Neo is anything but new. A still ignorant hero discovers his abilities and sets out to defeat evil.

In the end, even love is a central factor.This kind of hero's journey has proven itself many times in the past. The crucial thing here is also how this journey is staged and what effect the characters achieve. And this is where the strengths of 'Matrix'. The characters are special across the board and the whole world is new and fascinating. You get to know it little by little and understand how it works.As far as the special effects are concerned, 'Matrix' is still convincing some 20 years after its release. If you compare the effects with more recent movies, you'll notice differences, but 'Matrix' really doesn't need to hide. Fireworks are shot off with grandiose scenes.However, 'Matrix' is not a classic action movie, but also deals with deeper philosophical questions. The focus is always on the question of what is reality and what significance does it have to know the truth? A lot happens in the brain and maybe it is better for humans to live in an illusion.'Matrix' manages to credibly combine action, special effects and philosophical themes in one movie.

Timeless,"Matrix, the film that set the bar for the science fiction genre upon its release, remains an enduring masterpiece that continues to captivate audiences. The story of Neo and the all-encompassing, enslaving Matrix is timeless, cementing its place as one of the greatest achievements in cinematic history. The Wachowski siblings (formerly known as the Wachowski Brothers) have crafted a visionary work of art that transcends traditional action cinema. Matrix stands as a monument to their bold and groundbreaking filmmaking. The film explores profound philosophical concepts, delving into the nature of reality, identity, and the power of human perception. Keanu Reeves delivers a career-defining performance as Neo, a reluctant hero who discovers his true potential within the confines of the Matrix. His portrayal brings an unparalleled coolness and charisma to the role, solidifying Neo as an iconic character in cinema history. The supporting cast, including Laurence Fishburne as the enigmatic Morpheus and Carrie-Anne Moss as the fierce Trinity, contribute immensely to the film's success with their powerful performances. The action sequences in Matrix revolutionized the genre, blending wire-fu martial arts, groundbreaking visual effects, and mind-bending stunts. The film's iconic ""bullet time"" effect became a cultural phenomenon, influencing countless movies that followed. The Wachowskis' visionary direction, coupled with innovative cinematography and an unforgettable score by Don Davis, creates an immersive and electrifying atmosphere. Matrix's influence extends far beyond its initial release, inspiring filmmakers and sparking intellectual discussions about the nature of reality and the role of technology in society. It stands as a testament to the power of imagination, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in cinema. Matrix remains a true masterpiece, with few films coming close to its quality and visionary impact.

My big disappointment,"I must say that I am a small admirer of sci-fi movies. Nevertheless, I have always liked good action, even if it happens in outer space. I must remind you here great movies, like ""Total Recall"", ""Terminator"" and ""Star Wars"". These movies captured my phantasy and my curiosity. Great expectations I had when I started watching Matrix. I have heard so much about its deep dialogs and its special effects. In reality, those hopes collapsed in face of this movie. I have to confess that it is absolutely awful. Nothing more and nothing less. The dialogs are sprinkled with a myriad of pseudo-philosophic sentences, which are intended to awake in us deep thoughts. Well, it didn't arouse anything in me but boredom. I do not accept that Morphius has some kind of deep perspective on life and I do not accept Neo's battle with himself as representing something in our lives. The movie has engaged in a circle of happenings which do not take us anywhere. All the passes between the real world and the Matrix world are so casual and unsophisticated, that it puzzled me. I do not understand why did the producers of this movie bother with so many transitions between the worlds, when nothing really happens, and the basic difference between the worlds is always maintained. Lastly, I was deeply disappointed in the special effects. They are so simplistic and so few that I wonder whether this film should even be classified as a modern sci-fi.  My final conclusion would be that this movie has become some kind of culture item, and people were grasped by its media-magic. Two years after its release, it's so vane. Try to see it now, and you will be convinced.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
I first saw The Matrix on its initial theatre release back in 1999.,"I was probably a little young to truely grasp the complexity of the film at 13 but I do remember enjoying it. I've seen bits and pieces of it over the years on TV but hadn't really sat down to watch if again properly until now having bought The Matrix Trilogy on Blu-ray. The movie is still a great sci-fi flick and worthy of being called one of the best. The fights scenes, although a little slow this day and age, are well choreographed and heavy hitting - I particularly enjoy when people get thrown against or through walls and this movie has plenty of that! The bullet time effects and slow motion shots still hold up, and even though other films have copied it, The Matrix was the original and still does it better if you ask me. The storyline still feels futuristic even after 21 years and the CGI, although looking a tad dated, is still pretty sharp mostly (better than what was in the sequel, The Matrix Reloaded, oddly). The story can get a little confusing at times for new comers, infact there were things in this viewing that I had not picked up on or understood previously so just one viewing may not be enough to truely appreciate the film. The one thing the film didn't do for me however was the emotional relationships - I liked the characters, but the relationship between Neo and Trinity felt a bit forced for my liking. My favourite scene is the fight in the Subway between Agent Smith and Neo - it was a great lead in and a very back and foward encounter with neither man truely gaining the upperhand.Final Verdict: it's hard to fault such a genre defining film as The Matrix. The fights still look great, the story maintains a futuristic feel and it's surprisingly deep. But it is starting to show it's age ever so slightly with the action feeling slow and CGI looking a little bland. Still highly recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The modern interpretation of Plato's Allegory of the cave,When appreciating or hating this movie please read Plato's allegory of the cave. The concept of a world which is a mere shadow of reality created to enslave is one of Plato's most importance concepts created centuries before Christ. Ancient Greece philosophers were close to the truth before our world was cast into darkness by the monotheistic slave religions.Not for the action nor the special effects but for honouring plato's understanding of the weakness of human kind as presented in the allegory of the cave this is a great and important movie.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
This movie is one of the very few greats,"I remember seeing this film at the drive-in when I was 10 years old.. I was blown away.

Truly brilliant. Everyone who was a part of making this deserves so much praise..It's taken me a long time to ""review"" this film on here and honestly, having had an IMDb account for 20+ years now I don't know why I never did.I think the studio was distracted with its success because it seems that the sequels were all about the slow motion and visual effects... what was TRULY incredible about this film was the story.

Thoughts on The Matrix (without giving anything away)...,"An intellectual twist on the cyberpunk theme, drawing inspiration from the works of William Gibson, Philip K. Dick and even Terry Gilliam. Outstanding new special effects which may, according to some put The Phantom Menace in the shade, and the plot sidesteps nicely on a number of occasions allowing you to exercise the old grey matter a little. Lawrence Fishburne (Apocalypse Now, Boys N' The Hood, Event Horizon, Othello...) is as excellent and dramatic as ever. Keanu Reeves is, well just Keanu Reeves doing what he does best and that's looking perpetually confused. Also as the film is Australian, look out for a smattering of soap stars.....Well worth two hours of your time.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Painfully obvious, atrociously plotted, passably executed","For me, the experience of watching this film was like paying to watch paint dry in a room full of people who have never before seen paint dry and are hence absolutely thrilled by it.You will probably love it, mind you. That's your privilege.It just about functions as a crass action movie, provided you can sit through the tedious first hour, and the terrifyingly non-existent justification for something that (as several other reviewers have observed) could actually have been sensibly reasoned if anyone with reasonable intelligence or knowledge had been on the writing team.As it is, this mediocre script using an old, old, old idea has nothing to offer fans of sci fi who can read and were awake in the eighties, and considerably less to offer action fans than John Woo's Hong Kong films. The framing plot, when revealed, requires more than just a willing suspension of disbelief, it requires that you dismantle all your critical faculties and just content yourself with wallowing in the faintly entertaining special effects.It tries to be cool - and evidently succeeds in the eyes of many of the people who see it - but it seems to me little more than another soulless product of committee thinking and appeals to the lowest common denominator - and it doesn't get much lower than this.If you wish to see the same ground covered with more intelligence and visual flare, try the better-than-average film 'Dark City' (also mentioned by another reviewer) or the less accessible, but more stylish 'eXistenZ'. Not that I feel 'The Matrix' stole it's one flimsy idea from these films. This old chestnut has been around as long as cyberpunk has, and probably longer for all I know.Still, bread and circuses, I suppose.

Everything rolled into one.,"Once in a while, a film rolls into theatre with everything you (might) want. Style, Story, Special Effects, Sincerity, and moments you'll always remember. Obviously, The Matrix to most (including me), is one such film.Now let's forget about the flops that were Reloaded and Revolutions. It was about 5 years since the first release.To myself, The Matrix was a movie that added new things which I wanted to see in a movie. Quite impressive for two brothers who were virtually unknown at that time.Usually, any movie may contain one or two good things. The Matrix contained everything. Groundbreaking CGI and special effects basically brought its style into the new movie standards. The story and meanings have been parodied, read, and even used as course material.The Matrix is one movie in which people can watch again and again, and this is something I still watch today.Hopefully, 10 years down the road, someone will remake Reloaded and Revolutions to the standard that The Matrix set for its time.

I was in fact blown away by the fact of its linkage to our real-world now, in 2020.
The most satisfying or convincing thing about this movie is that even the villain's character is also justifiable. Most of the humans try to be in a comfort zone and wants to be ignorant all their lives, which is a natural human tendency, I believe.

Amazing movie!,"""The Matrix"" (1999) is a mind-bending, action-packed movie that will leave you questioning reality.The story follows Neo, played by Keanu Reeves, a computer hacker who discovers that the world he knows is just a simulation created by machines. He joins a group of rebels led by Morpheus, played by Laurence Fishburne, to fight against the oppressive machines and free humanity.The movie is known for its groundbreaking special effects, especially the iconic slow-motion bullet-dodging scenes. The action sequences are intense, and the martial arts choreography is impressive.What sets ""The Matrix"" apart is its thought-provoking concept of a simulated reality and the idea that we might not be living in the real world. It makes you question the nature of existence and the boundaries of technology.Overall, ""The Matrix"" is a classic sci-fi film that combines action, philosophy, and a dose of cyberpunk, making it a must-watch for anyone who enjoys thrilling movies with a twist.

A watchable action sci-fi movie that was and still is over-hyped...,"I sat down here in 2021 to re-watch the 1999 action sci-fi movie ""The Matrix"". Of course I have seen it before, back in the day when it was newly released. But I can't claim to have been much of a fan of the movie or the whole franchise actually. But I opted to sit down and watch them again, prior to sitting down to watch the newest addition to the franchise. But more about that one later.I never got onboard the 'Matrix is an amazing movie' train. Sure, I found the movie to be watchable, but it just wasn't an impressive movie in terms of script and storyline. So writers Lilly Wachowski and Lana Wachowski didn't really impress me back in 1999, and nor was revisiting the movie here in 2021 an eye-opening experience. I just never could delve into that whole artificial reality where the laws of physics and such doesn't apply.Visually then ""The Matrix"" was impressive, no doubt about it. And even today, 22 years later, the movie is actually still rather enjoyable in terms of visual effects and CGI. But a movie can only be sustained so much on visual effects alone.Something that definitely was impressive about ""The Matrix"" was the cast ensemble, because they had gotten together a great cast for the movie. Of course, Keanu Reeves is excellent in the movie, but then again, he does tend to have a track record of that. The movie also have the likes of Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving and Joe Pantoliano on the cast list. Now, back in the day I didn't really like Hugo Weaving, but I must admit that seeing the movie again definitely brings his monotonous performance of Agent Smith to a new light, because he did so rather phenomenally, and always was the star of the movie.I am not a fan of ""The Matrix"" franchise, nor will I ever become so. But I have to say that the amount of action in the movie and the execution of the action sequences was good, and the visual effects definitely helped to keep the movie afloat. But in terms of storyline and script, then ""The Matrix"" was sort of flawed and mundane.My rating of the 1999 action sci-fi from directors Lana Wachowski and Lilly Wachowski lands on a six out of ten stars.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A revolutionary movie,"When I saw this movie for the fist time when it came out. I thought it was the coolest and most badass movie ever made. I wasn't entirely sure what was going on when it came to the story at that time. But all I knew was that is was really cool. It's a bit outdated now but it still left a mark in cinema and inspired a lot of movie and more to come. The story is actually very creative and has sci-fi philosophical elements that is well blended into the story and isn't forced. And the dialogue is even cool and interesting. I am not going to get in depth with the story but I will just say that it's pretty clever without it being overly complex. This is probably Keanu Reeves's trademark movie and I can't picture anyone else taking the role of Neo besides him. And glad that someone like Will Smith didn't end up with this role. Nothing against Will Smith but Keanu Reeves is just the better candidate. He was just perfect for a movie like this and fit the image of a average cool hacker that gets picked or chosen to do something much much greater. Even the mentor character Morpheus(Laurence Fishburne) and the main villain Agent Smith played by Hugo Weaving are excellent choices for the roles they were given. The action was super cool and even amazing when this movie first came out. In fact it's the first movie I seen that blends slow motion and bullet time in a effective manner in a movie. It tries to combine so many stuff into this one film but it does it right. One of it is the anime film ""Ghost in the Shell"" which obviously played a huge part in inspiring the Wachowski brothers. Overall this is a cool and entertaining movie with some wicked ideas that all sci-fi movie watchers shouldn't miss out on...Well it's been out for more than a decade. It's a shame the sequels will ruin this awesome mythology of ""The Matrix"". To the point I think this movie would have been even more legendary if the sequels didn't come out or if the sequels was at least good as ""Dark City"".9.8/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Real deal sci-fi.,"This is a ludicrous film. Loud, brash and generally bombastic at every turn. Fortunately, it knows this and wears these features on its sleeve. It is knowing and ironic and has its tongue firmly in its cheek. The ideas, which will no doubt be hailed as 'startlingly original', are all stolen from Philip K. Dick, but at least its stealing from the best. It is basically familiar territory, territory mined by Dark City only a few years back. The Matrix, however, is an immeasurably superior film, simply by virtue of the fact that it does not take itself seriously. At times, the characters play their ludicrous lines so deadpan, it achieves a bizarre spooflike quality. Fishburne's performance, in particular, is splendidly arch as he delivers lines like 'Welcome to the desert of the real' with a misplaced Shakespearean grandeur.The effects are also ground-breaking and mostly effective. The use of slo-mo to eroticize the violence is reminiscent of Woo or even Peckinpah but with the use of clever CGI, Matrix achieves the feel of ballistic science. The shootouts do not revel in the familiar 'operatic grandeur' that has been a staple since Bonnie and Clyde. Rather, they play like FBI reconstructions of shootouts. We see the paths that bullets take, the positions of spent shell casings. It is shamelessly fetishistic and utterly irrelevant to the film's central idea but spectacular and exciting nonetheless.I hate virtually everything. Dark City was a nauseating waste of my time. Everything released over the last three summers has seemed despicably lazy film making. Godzilla, Armageddon...these films are offensive cynical money pits without a single grain of wit, a single interesting idea to tie the whole rotten mess together. Therefore, I fully anticipated hating the Matrix with equal vigor. As it was, I was pleasantly surprised. While I would make no claims that it was in any way a classic, it certainly appeared to have been put together with a great deal of love and humour and these attributes go a long way. It was overlong and unnecessarily portentous at times but these are minor quibbles when one is being bombarded by such a wealth of outrageous imagery and ideas. What other film could link Dick, Christ, Alice in Wonderland, Monty Python, Woo, Jackie Chan,  and still find time to make Keanu Reeves look good?",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Sci-Fi for the 21st Century,"I made the mistake of passing this movie by in the theaters, thinking it was just another sci-fi rehash with Keannu Reeves.  After having finally seen it on video, I realized I was dead wrong.  Over the next two weeks I saw it five different times as I introduced a host of friends to this movie, all of whom agree with me.  This is one of the best and most original sci-fi films of the last 20 years.  I will grant you that the movie as a whole is John Woo meets Isaac Asimov meets Star Wars, but the story itself is complex at first glance and just believable enough to be scary.The acting is an up-and-down affair.  Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving are outstanding in this film, and Carrie-Anne Moss is as competent as she is beautiful.  Keannu survived this film intact.  The other characters are largely understated, and I actually would have liked to see a little more character development.  For all the time they spend introducing Neo and idea of The Matrix, they kind of drop all the supporting cast into the film to try and make us believe it's not all about Neo, Trinity and Morpheus.The special-effects in this movie are outstanding, and have set the standard for eye-candy movies, basically the 1999 Independence Day.  With the advent of digital film technology via Lucasfilms, I have a feeling special effects will surpass themselves tenfold in the next ten years alone.  But for now this is the king of an ever-changing mountain.  In the meantime, the Wachowski brothers demonstrated that there is still room in Hollywood for creative camera work.  Some of the shots are outstanding, and even with the most subtle and understated shots, you get the idea that every single shot and angle is exactly where it is meant to be, for a very specific purpose. The cinematography is, to me, the real gem of the film, the diamond in the middle of an above-average story and above-average acting. The Messianic theme is prevalent in science fiction so this movies is easily compared, not only to Star Wars, but any number of sci-fi films and Japanese anime features.  But all in all, I think this film is an outstanding effort, it will be a crime when it doesn't get a Best Picture nomination, and I can't wait for 2 and 3.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Great Sci-Fi kung fu flick,"Keanu Reeves stars as Thomas Anderson, a.k.a. Neo in his cyber-hecker world. He receives various messages from the cyber-criminals, Trinity and Morpheous.

Christianity in the Matrix,"There was many similarities between the Christian faith and The Matrix. Perhaps it was completely unintentional but there was quite a few parallels. Many characters in the movie corresponded with characters from The Bible, and some of the stories in the bible matched up with the storyline and the plot of The Matrix.  Neo was like Jesus, Morpheus was like John the Baptist, Trinity was like Mary, and Cypher was like Judas.  Judas betrayed Jesus just as Cypher betrayed Morpheus and Neo.  Also the rebirth of Neo was alot like baptism.  Cypher was in many ways exactly like Judas, and The Matrix could be seen as a comparison to our world.  I think there was alot of similarities between The Matrix and The Bible and one really good one was how morpheus gave his life for Neo, even though the characters were different it lines up with Jesus' death on the cross.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Lawrence Fishbourne was also a sight of perfectness, and his whole role fitted in nicely.  however i did feel that there was absolutely no need for them to build up characters of switch, apoc, tank and mouse when there lives were destined to die immediately or instantaniously. in conclusion it is a classic film and will live on to be one of the greatest and so will the following two films to follow then it will make a complete trilgoy, something to look forward to!",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

But now I do ask, do you believe that The Matrix is real, that is to say, the concept that we are dominated by softwares and that? if you responded that yes, I tell you:YOU ARE A DAMNED DEGENERATE OF SH*T!, DON'T CONTINUE READING THISit is necessary to see that the nerds ruins everything, and to think that one sees this type of movies at the beginning to see the scenes of fights and shootings, but while more you see it, it begins you in interesting the history, but to the long one you annoying restitution and it is left. And if not, a friend of the secondary that was obsessed with this movie that tired already, saw until it contaminated me temporarily the fever when they used for the first time ""Matrix Reloaded"" in 2003, but he had a limit and I got tired of that, like to reject the trilogy during some time, but now I recapture with idea of giving his importance to certain philosophy (although in the VG already ridiculous the prophecies of Morpheus), the fights (in Revolutions that seemed a fight it Goku-Vegeta of Dragon Ball Z) and the movie that it lifted more expectations was ""Matrix Reloaded"", where they became more fictitious, but even so, good.when I said that the nerds ruined everything, it is true, the example of the fans of Matrix and of Star Wars is an annoying point, because always one goes to those stupid nerds that almost prostitute to get some souvenir or article with respect to this type of movies.In spite of the nerds and fanatic who's in any aspect ruin tremendous movies like this one, my vote for ""Matrix"" is of 9/10.P.S. NERDS GO TO HELL, DEGENERATES GO TO AN ASYLUM, FU**ING FREAKS!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
