A Surprisingly Good Sports Film Lacking Most Cliché,"During the 2010 Winter Olympics, NBC broadcast a 30-minute documentary piece on the 1980 US Olympic ice hockey team. While I knew the story of how they beat the Soviets and won the Gold Medal (I had seen it live as a kid), I was expecting some clichéd rhetoric about the team and what they had done, akin to films like ""Knute Rockne, All American"" (1940) and ""Rocky"" (1976). I was pleasantly surprised to find that the story was anything but. The coach of that team, Herbert Brooks, was no hackneyed clone of a Knute Rockne or a Vince Limbardo. Instead he was a tight-fisted uncompromising hockey general who distanced himself from his players, more like a Bobby Knight than a Knute. This was not someone with whom teammates would feel comfortable having a beer. Instead, his inspiration to the players came from the other direction, by exposing their weaknesses and in some cases using unfairness and resentment as anchors from which to get the best out of his players. I decided that ""Miracle"" might be worth a look, especially as a prelude to the US vs Canada in the gold medal round of 2010 Olympic Hockey.Kurt Russell portrays Herbert Brooks as a lean and mean hockey coach who leaves sentimentality at the front door of the ice hockey rink. From the get-go he informs his players he's not there to be their friend. His goal is to let loose their highest playing potential coupled with the best conditioning among the Olympic hockey players at all costs. At times, he seems to be driving the players too hard well-beyond their comfort zones. Much of the story is the unconventional training techniques he uses to prepare the players for the 1980 Winter Olympics. According to the film, Brooks is relatively new to these techniques which he adopted while studying USSR hockey. His plan is to use the Soviets' techniques against them in the Olympics, which is not just about strategy but also about extreme discipline and an uncompromising tough sensibility akin to the military. One character points out that everything Brooks does has a purpose behind it.The only short-coming in the script may be the portrayal of Brooks' wife who finds her relationship with her husband compromised, at least according to the film. I wondered if it played out in real life as in the film or if it was fabricated by the screenwriters. Too many sports movies have this sort of relationship with the wife acting as the balance between the obsessive coach and the needs of his family. She's been through this before. Why did she marry him in the first place? To be a successful account?Certainly, most Americans know the outcome of the story, although the sequence of the game between the US and the Soviets is riveting and plays out about as well as the fight between Rocky and Apollo Creed. However, the meat of the story is really about the relationship between Brooks and his players, and the coach's single-minded determination to create the best Olympic team possible. By putting a certain amount of anger and determination into their hearts and heads, Brooks brings out the best in them, much like a sergeant in boot camp. The speech before the Americans played the Soviets is one of the better scenes of its type, leaving behind the ""do it for the Gipper"" silliness that has become a sports cliché. The only moment which was lacking in the film was the speech before the very final game when the US played Finland after the Soviets. In that speech, apparently Brooks told his team that if they didn't win, they would go to their graves regretting the missed opportunity. I would have liked to have seen Russell give that speech as well. Apparently Herb Brooks died before the principal shooting of this film had ended, and the film is dedicated to him. Just about as fitting a tribute as a coach could ask for.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A Miracle for Disney,"Don't let the fact that this is a Disney movie deter you from watching a thoroughly enjoyable and adult-level sports movie for two-plus hours. Kurt Russell does an excellent job portraying coach Herb Brooks as a complex and sometimes ruthless and inscrutable leader. Very UN-Disney-like indeed.I am not a hockey fan - in fact I dislike the game intensely - yet I enjoyed the well-crafted scenes of competitive team play. Knowing the outcome of the BIG GAME did not detract at all from the excitement and suspense surrounding it. Sort of like the suspense Ron Howard achieved in Apollo 13 (where we knew in advance the outcome, but were worried about and later relieved for our astronauts).A must-see for sports fans and non-fans alike.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Good movie,"I was wary at first of  Disney production of this film. I didn't want the cheesy Mighty Ducks type of sports movie, especially when dealing with the awesome task completed by these players. I thought the film makers did a nice job and the movie itself was quite entertaining. I think it exposes a whole generation to the 1980 U.S. hockey team and what they accomplished. Even though I am not a fan of Kurt Russell, I thought he was very good as Herb Brooks. He had the mannerisms and the voice down very well. Russell is a huge hockey fan himself so I know it was honor for him to play Brooks. For die hard hockey fans, this movie will entertain and it does not poison the game action or what it is really like to play hockey.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"It was winter of 1980, and I remember it well.","'Miracles do happen', the announcer's original broadcast is heard during the scenes recreated for this movie, 'Miracle.' Anyone who remembers what happened during those Winter Olympics in 1980 will know what this movie is about, and how it ends. However, there can be no spoilers, because this is not a movie about a hockey game, or even the sport of hockey. Nor is it about the players. It is solely about the coach, Herb Brooks, who, with his unconventional style and wisdom about the game, took these young hockey players to a level no one thought possible. In the end it didn't really matter whether they won or lost the game against the Russian. What mattered was that each of the 20 players found out what was possible inside himself.The movie begins with a montage of scenes from the period, the years, leading up to the selection of the Olympic hockey team in the summer of 1979. The cold war. The oil shortage and long gasoline lines. The disgraced President Nixon. The embattled President Carter. The Russians invading Afganistan. Then we see coach Brooks doing it his own way. A year and a half of scouting, one day of try-outs, to pick the 26 players which would eventually be cut to 20 for the competition. The DVD extras show us how much went into making the movie faithful, including a session with Brooks himself, who died in an accident right after filming was wrapped up. A very fine movie of a very inspirational journey.",,Anonymous,History
Miracle Gets A Hat Trick,"Miracle is a Walt Disney movie about hockey. This sounds like Mighty Ducks, but believe me, it's not. Miracle stands on its own as a great movie. Disney has made true stories about sports in the past like Remember the Titans, and movies like that had the same Disney feel. Miracle is a movie for everyone to go see. It is a wonderful movie about a true game in history.This movie tells the story of Herb Brooks. Brooks works endlessly studying films and picking players to represent the United States in the Olympics. He doesn't just see this as a job, but he sees it as a second chance. Brooks was on the 1960 Olympic hockey team, but just before they left to compete, Brooks was cut from the team. The team went on to win, but Herb Brooks wasn't there to get the gold. Now this is his chance to win. The movie starts with Brooks getting the job and from there we see his plan. Brooks tells his players from the start how he's not going to be their friend, but he's going to be their coach. When Brooks says something he means it. Brooks changes the way the Americans play and he teaches them the way their tough opponents play. Brooks plans to beat them at their own game. It seems impossible in the beginning for Brooks to get these young guys that have never played together, and teach them a whole new way to play. It also seems impossible for the USA team to defeat the Soviet Union. The Soviets seem like an unstoppable force that can't be beaten. When you see the Soviets in action it does look impossible, but this movie shows how nothing is impossible. Miracle really doesn't go into all of the players, except Jim Craig. Craig and his father are going through a tough time because of Mrs. Craig's death. You see Jim struggle and all you want throughout the movie is for him to win the big one for his family. Besides Jim Craig, you're never really introduced to the rest of the guys. The only one that you're with throughout the movie is Herb Brooks, well portrayed by Kurt Russell. You see what it's like to assemble a winning team. You also see Brooks getting so caught up in his work that he has no time for his family. All you want is for this guy to win.This movie is more than just a sports movie. It is a movie that shows dreams can come true. You watch a team of young guys bond and become a family. You see these guys win from all of their hard work and determination. Their win at the time was a miracle and even today watching this movie you get the same great feeling that these guys did the impossible. This is a great sports movie and even if you don't like sports, it is still a great movie.I highly recommend this movie to everyone. It is a movie that you should definitely see if you're down because it is a movie about hope. It is also about victory and when the movie is over it will have every red-blooded American cheering for the good old USA. This movie must have done something right because it had everyone get just as excited as they would have been years ago. When the USA team shoots that final goal to make the score 4 to 3 and the clock starts to wind down, you see everyone getting more and more excited. Finally when the clock runs out and you see that the USA has won, everyone is on their feet cheering. Then when the American flag is waved high in the air you hear the people in the theater cheering USA. Miracle made you feel as if you were back in time witnessing the real game. The movie lets you know what's going on at the time with clips from history and it is just amazing how a film can do this. Be sure not to miss this spectacular film. I guarantee you will not be disappointed. The movie is well written, well acted, and well filmed so Miracle gets a Hat Trick.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Great job, Kurt et al","Kurt Russell does a wonderful job of portraying Herb Brooks, an innovative hockey coach, and a hard-driving motivator of the young American team that competed at, and won, the 1980 Lake Placid Olympic hockey championship. Indeed, everyone is great, including the hockey players who learned to act to portray the famous group of college amateur players that Brooks pulled together to form a tight-knit and well-conditioned squad.Camera work and re-creation of key plays is amazing -- maybe the best hockey footage ever shot (see the DVD special features). Also touching is the collage of tragic events involving the USA in the 60's and 70's, leading up to the Olympics. By the way: I found the (voiceover) speech we hear from 1980 by Jimmy Carter (""The USA has a crisis of confidence.."") as moving as MLK's famous ""I have a dream"" speech. It sets the stage nicely for the events that follow - we all need a dream from time to time, or maybe a Miracle.And you don't feel sorry for the Russians, this the last vestige of an arrogant cold-war-produced hockey machine: seasoned veterans laying out college kids with nasty body-checks, or slashes (just in case you thought us Canucks had the patent rights to tough hockey). Good news, though: the USA was up to it, repaying hefty checks in spades.Finally, there is is some insight into Brooks hockey ideas, years ahead of their time: carefully-rehearsed breakout plays, circle patterns of player movement, and short 40-50 second shifts to keep players fresh.There is a nice up-to-dater on where the players were in 2006 when the film was made, but the NHL careers were overlooked - several of these guys went on to have stellar careers in professional hockey. The talent level was substantial.Anyway-- good job all around.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Historically accurate and put in good context,"Even if you're not a sports fan you can appreciate this movie for being historically accurate. Compared to other sports movies, this one and ""Hoosiers"" are the two best ever made.It begins with scenes from the 70's and they do a great job throughout pointing out the Iran hostage crisis, gasoline shortages and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, yet not to the point where any of those things are overdone.I wish they would've shown more of the gold medal game against Finland, but the movie was already long enough and it might have taken away from the drama of beating the Soviets.As for other things, Kurt Russell is excellent as Coach Brooks. My favorite scenes with him are the ""Great Moments"" speech and when he tells the team of the Russian style of play and how they can play with them by attacking rather than defending.And I love the fact that they got a small clip of the famous Mean Joe Greene Coke Commercial, which in fact came out at that time, the fall of 1979.The outcome is predictable, since we all know who won, but in spite of that, this movie has plenty of drama and suspense. Finally, this is also a family friendly movie--no excessive profanity or sexual scenes. Definitely a ""10"" in my book.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Great movie!,"I stopped myself from chanting USA USA in the theater, because my wife would have left, but I still got emotional and raised my hands up when the US scored.  I still miss the Jets leaving the Peg, and still have the game reflexes when I watched the movie with a hockey crowd.  I remember watching most of the games when I was eleven.  Everyone hated the big Red machine from the Soviet Union, that killed the NHL all stars, and team USA afterward in a pre-Olympic game.  Part of the cold war fever taking place and this movie showed the importance of the game back in 1980. I was chanting USA USA while watching the game, live at home and remember Craig with the flag, all the players standing on the podium during the medal ceremony.  This must of had a huge influence on Hockey in the USA, and turned a lot of youngsters onto the game!  Being a hockey nut I remember watching the US during the 80's and they would lose in the first round at the Canada cups but with the younger players coming up they got better in every tournament, and finally made the cup final in 1992.  This event and the infusion of Canadian junior hockey coaches into their college system makes the US, the hockey power it is today.  Is is no longer just Canada and the Russians, I figure there will be many Canada, USA olympic gold medal games with maybe a movie about it one day.  Great hockey movie the advisors made the goaltending, and puck movement so real.  Russell looks and acts like a coach, from the coaching view, not the fan.  Brooks later became the coach of the Rangers, it was classy of them showing his picture at the end of the movie. 7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,History
An Enjoyable Film Even If You Don't Like Hockey,"In 1980, Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell), a former Olympics hockey player cut from the winning 1960 U.S. team, put together a ragtag band of college hockey players, taking them to the Winter Olympics at Lake Placid to face the seemingly invincible Russian hockey team, winners of four successive gold medals. Miracle tells the true story of how they worked together to defy the odds working against them. Everyone likes a good upset especially when they can cheer on the winning team. Miracle gives you that story and its a nice film to watch with your family. I don't watch hockey because I don't really like it and its just not very appealing to me. But there's things that non-hockey fans can enjoy from this film. I liked the determination from the team and the inspiration the coach gave to them. Kurt Russell does an awesome job as Herb Brooks, probably his best performance in a long time. Patricia Clarkson does a good job playing his wife and all the players on the team aren't bad either. The one actor that was bad was Noah Emmerich, he just showed little to no emotion and didn't really put in a good effort. This wouldn't had been a problem if he had a small role but he was the assistant coach. Miracle is directed by Gavin O'Connor and he does a good job. The hockey itself wasn't actually that bad as some scenes of the game were pretty cool. The focus is on mainly on Russell and while you learn some stuff about the players it would had been nice if they had shifted some of the attention on them as well. The screenplay may be filled with clichés but the film does it right even if it feels like you have seen it before because you probably have. The film is 135 minutes long and for me it started dragging a little and getting kind of boring. The movie is also predictable so the ending game as well as the entire movie isn't really suspenseful. The focus is more on beating Russia then actually winning the medal. When they do play in the final game and win the medal, they only show them scoring the winning shot. After that Kurt Russell starts talking saying how they won the last game by coming up from behind. While we know the outcome to the whole thing it still would had been nice if they had added a few more scenes. Its also better then The Mighty Ducks but that's not a hard thing to do. Rating 7/10 a treat for hockey fans and a film that a normal movie-goer can enjoy.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Mesmerizing Movie!,"Miracle is one of the better sports movies that I have seen. The movie portrays the United States team's unlikely Gold Medal victory at the 1980 Winter Olympics. It does one hell of a job at capturing one of the greatest moments in sports history.There are many elements that make the movie great. The actors really get into it and make you believe they are the players. Kurt Russell turns in an astounding performance as Team USA's coach Herb Brooks.The critical event in the movie however is the time period and events surrounding everything. The Miracle On Ice occurred during the Cold War and not long after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. Morale was deteriorating at home and the country was in desperate need of a morale booster. That came in the form of a hockey game.The Soviet Union had been the dominant hockey power for years winning gold medals in 64, 68, 72, and 76. The US is a team made up of young college kids molded into an effective unit by coach Herb Brooks. The US would end up playing the Soviets as a huge underdog. It is a story of the little team that could versus the superpower. David versus Goliath basically. The events taking place made this more then a hockey game. This was a competition between 2 countries with heightened tensions. Even before the puck drops you can feel the intensity in the air.Overall you don't have to like hockey or know an ice skate from a roller skate to appreciate this movie. It is an unlikely underdog story surrounded by international turmoil. The movie is inspiring and the best fact is it really happened. Miracle is a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Good movie, wrong title",The title doesn't match the story because it's not miraculous given that Herb Brooks knew exactly what he was doing from having figured the Soviets out through extensive obsessive studying. That's why he insisted at the beginning that he was the man for the job; it's not like he winged it or just stuck with the same scheme the Americans had been using all along and somehow it merely finally happened.,6.0,Anonymous,History

what I thought,"I am the child of two St. Paul east- siders.  My father has loved hockey for as long as he can remember.  My mom, well, she just likes sports in general. Hockey ruled my life from the very first moments.  First my father's practices and games, then my little brother, later on there were boyfriends, friends, high school, and college.  Now there is Gophers and Wild. I imagine that hockey will continue to define my life for a very long time.That said, for Minnesota kids there are legends told to them from the beginning.  How Paul Bunyan shaped our lakes and rivers, and lived ""Up North"", and there is Herb Brooks.  Legends that define Minnesota heritage.Herb Brooks was a man who shaped the way hockey is viewed in Minnesota.  A stand out at St. Paul Johnson High School, and at the U.  He went to coach his beloved Gophers and work with his idol John Mariucci.  Now the ice at Mariucci Arena (not 2 miles from where I sit now) bears tribute to Herby. His coaching techniques are still used and abused throughout the state.Kurt Russell paid apt tribute to our late leader, and I am positive he would be impressed.  I was fortunate enough to get sneak-preview tickets to see Miracle, and I can honestly say I don't remember when I had such a good time at the movies.  I don't think I stopped smiling once.  Russell's accent was good throughout the movie, but on just a few lines I could have SWORN that he was a Minnesotan.  He elongated his vowels very well.Eddie Cahill did a superb job as Jim Clark.  I wondered how exactly he would play someone so torn between immense sadness and undeniable pride. I was even more impressed with his hockey skills.  I hope that this helps the very yummy Mr. Cahill move from TV-boyfriend dujor (friends, Sex and the City) to a great movie actor.  As it is the only thing that disappointed me was that he was running around the Cities last summer, and I had no idea.If you are still reading this it goes without saying that I think you should see this movie.  Sure you know how it ends, you've probably seen the game at least once on ESPN Classic even if you are old enough to remember it in the first place.  The portrayal of our country at such a dark time in the world's history is historically great.  Apt tribute is paid to Afghanistan (even if we are repeating the USSR's mistakes now), the Ayatollah, the oil embargo, and the general distrust in government.  The Miracle on Ice was a very bright spot in a very dark time, and Miracle does a wonderful job showing just that.  To those who say, who outside the US cares?  I say hockey fans care.  Sports fans care.  This is not just a hockey movie (though it is a great one); it is a movie about hard work and perseverance. Isn't that what America really stands for?So, Bravo Disney.  I think Herby would have been pleased.  I know that I am.",,Anonymous,History
Killer sports movie,"Not the kind of hockey movie I was expecting, especially a Disney one. ""Miracle"" is a laboring trek to the first game, full of self-doubt and brooding (personified by Kurt Russell, who owns this movie, hands down). The geopolitics hang heavy over all of this, but at least it doesn't devolve into jingoism. But once we get into the Olympic games, it's an energized movie indeed. the payoff isn't USA beating the Soviets (we know the history), it's in the team finally coming together. Really electrifies that final game. Even still, you'd have to be dead inside not to smile when Eruzione pulls the team ahead 4-3. And just try not to get misty during Russell's end narration.

This years Academy award winning best actor...,"Its incredible to note that the one truly negative review so far of this movie is by one who described it as a movie about the ""U.S. Olympic soccer team.""  No, not a typo, the reviewer actually used the word soccer 3 times! And even more pathetic was how the reviewer concluded by saying the movie would have been better had it been about something else!  Its pretty pathetic to not like a movie when you obviously have not seen it, its even worse to actually do a review about it.Oh well, on to my review...The movie MIRACLE will be enjoyed by millions, even if they know nothing about hockey, which is very fitting as millions enjoyed the 1980 gold medal performance of the USA Hockey Team, many of them non-hockey fans as well. It brilliantly captures the moment of the miracle, after beautifully detailing the events that led up to the decisive win over the Russians.I went to the UW at the same time that Mark Johnson did, which makes the movie (as well as the actual miracle) even more compelling to me.  The only people I could imagine not liking this movie are those that either hate sports, or those that watch the movie and come away thinking it was about a soccer match (hehe):)The only thing worse than Chicago winning an Oscar would be if Kurt Russell didn't win an Oscar for best actor!  He truly dominates the movie, which was a heartwarming tribute to Herb Brooks who died virtually during the filming of this movie.  The supporting cast did their roles perfectly, as did the makers of this film, who delivered one of the most accurate portrayals of one of the most exciting sporting events of the 20th century.Go see this movie...if you leave not liking it, then check your pulse to see if you are still alive.  Or if you come away thinking it was a movie about soccer, then lightning truly can strike twice in the same place!",6.0,Anonymous,History
Very Realistic Hockey Scenes Help Make This A Winner,"This was a pretty nice movie overall. It had its bad points but they were more subtle. The good stuff was out in front: the realistic hockey scenes and the inspiring true-life story of an amazing underdog sports team pulling off the ""miracle."" That, of course, was the 1980 United States Olympic hockey team winning the gold medal and along the way becoming the first team in 20 years to defeat the Soviets.The story also is about Herb Brooks, the coach of the team. Everything in here centers around him. Kurt Russell does a nice job playing him, although I don't understand the Polish accent Russell used. Why would Brooks have a Polish accent?Over the years, sports movies - as in other genres - are becoming more and more realistic. This was about as good as it gets in that regard. A number of the actors are players, meaning they know how to skate. A documentary with the DVD shows the great lengths they went to in filming this in order make the action look realistic. It's not fake; these guys know how to play the game and the camera-work, along with the sound, is outstanding.For a fairly long film (135 minutes) this film moves by fast and the drama is there but not super-intense since everyone knows the final result. The story is basically, as mentioned, about Brooks and the way he molded a group of kids together to play so well as a team. Many of his ideas would not have been implemented had others had a say, but Brooks proved them all wrong.The only part of the film that was totally unnecessary was the typical Liberal slant that Hollywood just has to put in our faces every chance it gets. Here, they do it by quick cheap shots against Republican Presidents while airing an inspirational speech by Democrat Jimmy Carter. They have just stuck with the hockey angle, which the filmmakers here did extremely well. Still, it's a very good sports movie that even non- hockey fans should enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,History
No Miracles Happened Here,"There are too many good stories to bring to the big screen. Therefore, a hierarchy exists in the script room. Films with the underdog coming from behind to overcome enormous odds just aren't enough anymore. Miracle made the jump to production not because it's about this but because of its sub story about the effect the underdog's victory had. 'Do you believe in miracles?'The story is about one coach trying to bring the USA Olympic team to glory against the unbeatable Soviets. His team is comprised of twenty-some athletes fresh from either Boston of Minnesota, hence a rivalry. Their average age is twenty-one while their opponets have been playing together for ten years. Of course we all know what happens because, like all other sports stories, this one comes with the tagline 'Based on a True Story'. But that, albeit important, is not really what matters. The main focus is here is how they do it.The team has a drill. They skate from the red line to the blue line back to the red. Simple, right? After tying a game, the coach (Kurt Russell) brings his team back out onto the ice as the audience is leaving and makes them run this drill again and again and again and again and again and again It's the most well done scene in the whole movie. It has you sympathizing with all the people on the screen. You understand Russell's anger and need to win but still can't believe he'd make them skate the drill again. Again and again. In the pit of your stomach you feel as if you may vomit yourself. The scene is set in partial darkness and scored subtly.Too much time is spent trying to develop a side story about Russell's past career as an Olympian and how he feels he was robbed of a medal. This causes him to throw himself into his work and neglect his family. There are two or three arguments he has with his wife that start one way and then morph into wannabe 'money scenes' that might as well have tears streaming from the wife's eyes and a drunk, angered Russell. Instead, they try to get that same feeling across with their dialogue but that falters. However, everything comes across as silly and contrived.Miracle is a Disney movie and it shows. It is clean family fun that is also uplifting and, from a distance, a good time. It gets across all the major points of the 'based on a true story' genre, including the side story built around the coach. The players are inter-changeable and yet you feel as if you know them. The movie gets you cheering and that was probably all it ever aspired to do. ***/*****",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Another feel good, lessons learned film from Disney","As a Canadian, I sat back with much anticipation north of the border for reviews of the new Disney film Miracle, chronicling the rise and eventual glory of the 1980 USA Hockey Team at the XIII Olympics.  I knew as Canadians we would not take kindly to watching again the euphoria of a country winning at our national game.  I knew that there would be the usual flag waving that American's like to put in their sports films and I knew this would put off even the most unbiased and objective of Canadian film reviewers.  I knew that given all the above, it would be hard to find a positive review of the film even if it succeeded where most sports films fail. Unfortunately, I was right.Miracle is the story of Herb Brooks, a coach with roots in the minor leagues that is chosen to lead a group of unknown hockey players against the powerhouse of the Russian team that had not lost in international competition in 20 years.  Herb (Kurt Russell) adopts a new approach of taking the game to the opposition rather than simply defending against them. In efforts to accomplish this monumental feat, Herb raises eyebrows by taking on a group of hard workers rather than statistical players.  `I'm not looking for the best players Jim, I'm looking for the right ones' he exclaims to his assistant coach Craig Patrick.The results are at first, disasterous, but once the team begins to build character and believe in their coaches vision, the victories begin to amass and their road to the Olympic podium begins.Anyone over the age of 35 will remember the Miracle on Ice.  Russia had just invaded Afghanistan and there was much tension between the two world powers. The Olympics were expected to be boycotted by Russia due to President Jimmy Carters harsh words towards the Russian offensive, but cooler heads prevailed and athlete's were not punished for their governments politics.Russia came into the Olympics the odds on favorite.  They had not lost in international competition in years and had recently beaten the best the NHL had to offer just weeks before.  The U.S. on the other hand did not even rank on the Olympic hockey radar.  The previous Olympics saw the squad being trounced by scores of incredible discrepancy.  But history was to be made in Lake Placid and American hockey was on the map.Hockey movies have not done incredibly well at the box office.  Sure, the Mighty Ducks was a small success spanning a few sequels, but if you were to pick the best hockey movie of all time, outside of Slap Shot there is not much to choose from (Youngblood, Mystery Alaska).  However, director Gavin O'Connor does a good job of telling the story of the coach rather than the team, and this seems to work under the strong acting performance by Russell.The movie does have faults.  At over two hours, the film seemed longer than it should have been and the editing of the on-ice action seemed as if it was shot by different directors, one having a flare for following the play and other wanting to show the skates and low angle shots.However, for anyone that remembers the series, all the elements and events were duplicated.  Who can forget the goal with no seconds remaining at the end of the first period or the fact that Tretieck, the best goalie to maybe ever play the game, was benched by Russia for the remaining 40 minutes?Miracle is a feel-good, bring your family to, kinda movie.  It shows you what hard work and believing in yourself is all about, and really, how many movies can honestly credit themselves with that?",7.0,Anonymous,History

The movie did a good job showing how seemingly impossible it seemed for the young American team to beat the best team in the world who had been playing together for 10 years. And Kurt Russell did a good job as the tough coach who was hard on the players to get the most out of them. I also liked the way the hockey games were filmed. I think hockey is the most boring sport and I don't know any of the rules, but the way it was filmed let the least knowlegdable person follow what was going on.FINAL VERDICT: If you like sports movies, then don't miss this one.",,Anonymous,History
"Sports, Yummy","I flippin love sports movies. I think one of the few things that Hollywood does right is sports action sequences. I could watch a full two hours of sports action sequences.""Miracle,"" which is based upon the 1980 USA hockey team which beat the USSR in a game dubbed ""the miracle on ice,"" is now my favorite hockey movie. There wasn't much competition as I'm not a fan of the ""Mighty Ducks"" franchise, and ""Slap Shot"" just didn't do it for me. Coach Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell) was so intense and so singularly focused on one goal (no pun intended) it was stunning. Kurt Russell crushed the role as coach Herb.What I appreciated most was Hollywood portraying the game against Russia as it actually happened. Every sports movie usually comes down to the last second or last out to go ahead for the win. In ""Miracle"" the USA team scored the go ahead goal with ten minutes left in the third period and never again relinquished the lead. This is very antithetical for Hollywood, but they went with historical accuracy and were still able to make it suspenseful. A one goal lead with ten minutes to go against the best team in the world is never safe. Watching as the time slowly bled off the clock while Russia relentlessly attacked was still exciting.I am a novice when it comes to hockey, though I do know the difference between a blue line and a clothesline (to quote Al Michaels). I may not watch hockey at all, but put a good sports story in front of me and I'll watch it even if it's curling.

It's a Miracle I wasn't enthralled,"I won't always use full sentences.  A phrase, or word is as good as a mile.Expected to embrace this film with my entire being.  Forget entire.Kurt Russell gave a fine performance as Herb Brooks, coach of the U.S. Olympic soccer team that won the gold medal at the 1980 Olympics.  The 20+ soccer players were interchangeable with semi-memorable personal stories. And this is where MIRACLE failed me.  Unlike SEA BISCUIT, where 3 human lives and 1 animal life, combined to form the ""perfect storm"" that was the story of Sea Biscuit, in MIRACLE the chemistry that makes good stories extraordinary was missing.  Hooray USA.  Hooray soccer team.  Hooray Herb Brooks.  But I was only touched intellectually, not viscerally.  And, since I'm no script doctor, I offer no further opinion in that area.Give me stories about people, real or fictional, that I can care about, cry with, be frightened of, or admire beyond description.MIRACLE failed, for me, by not even arousing deep feelings for Herb Brooks who had such a desperate need to win that Olympic game because he had been sent home, 20 years before, being unable to play on the U.S. team that won the gold medal in 1960.  Here was a human story barely touched upon and which, with a little milking, might have possibly saved MIRACLE, a wasted opportunity - quite sadly so.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Good sport drama,"A sports drama based on a true event. To be honest, there are a million movies with this same theme, where an outsider defeats an invincible giant. Basically this is not a bad movie at all but it just didn't show me anything new or spectacular. There are a lot of good things, the training process, creating a team, Kurt Russell's role is good, but I couldn't remember anyone from the players except the goalkeeper.

Exploitative and Fun,"Despite the fact that this movie is made to manipulate us, it's so darn much fun, it doesn't matter. You have a true story with great action scenes, wonderful hockey footage. You have the bad guy Russians and their powerhouse team, you have a group of really attractive American young men, and, finally, best of all, Kurt Russell's wonderful portrayal of the frenetic Herb Brooks. Being a Minnesotan, Mr. Brooks is a real hero around here, dying tragically in a car accident a few years ago. He molded this team and made them more than they should have been. There is a nice interaction among the characters. It's not simply a coach with total insensitivity and a bunch of young men who are going to ""show him."" He has great affection, but he knows that dreams take hard work, and so he pushes them mercilessly. There is the chess match of picking the right players and personalities and then messing with their minds. He even brings in a former U of M player to make them a little nervous. It helps create the team because this guy hadn't been part of the family. Anyway, the movie is a joy to watch, even though we know the ending.

"Nice, but nothing special  (**1/2)","Way too long, hurt by some very corny dialogue and a little too much flag-waving, this story of the U.S. hockey team's victory against the formidable Russian team at the 1980 Olympics is still pretty well done.It's pretty slow going most of the time, but is worth checking out for the excellent final game sequence, which has been shot in an intense way that places you directly in the middle of the action, making it suspenseful even though the outcome is obvious.Kurt Russell is very good as the coach, though his character flirts with being unsympathetic at times. The team is played by a large group of unknown actors who all do good work, but only Eddie Cahill stands out as Jim Craig, a troubled player.Not a great movie, but it was alright.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Oddly Not Captivating,"27 December 2008. This attempts to replicate and dramatize the real life story of the miracle U.S. Hockey Team's win over the Soviets in the 1980 International Olympic Games at Lake Placid, New York. However, while captures some interesting highpoints, the movie strangely misses the personal stories, the emotionally compelling human interest that defines the unique, memorable personalities of this real human drama. In a paradox, the real life coach Herb Brook's story of unifying a young team of individual hockey players resulted in just that, a movie about a team, not about interesting personalities and stories that interest. The movie's potential to help capture the thrill of this historic moment was diminished somewhat by the more traditional photography with only glimpses of genuine interesting historic tidbits.",6.0,Anonymous,History
American Arrogance Applied to a Canadian Game,"This movie was useless on a number of levels. However, the main reason this movie deserves to reside in the bargain bin is due to the way it's played out.

It does not capture the essence of the game, or even the essence of that one game. It simply says ""here are some Americans, who will OVERCOME A PROBLEM."" everyone will feel nice and proud at the end, and go home happy.

While there are plenty of minor things I could quibble about, Miracle's ability to recapture the spirit of the Soviet upset makes it a success.A movie about this subject could easily have been a stinker, but Miracle isn't that at all.

Love,I don't go out of my way to watch hockey but I know quite a few people who remember watching this game and how amazing it was at the time. It is a throwback to when a lot of us remember having some pride in our country and occasionally when I start to forget that we are lucky to live here I like to watch this. Also I knew quite a few former military who knew the actor that played OC before he committed suicide and all who did sang his praises. Regardless if you love sports movies this is a great watch and the action on the ice is wonderful. We know how it ends but it is but it is nice to see that they all worked very hard and it was one of the last times that non professional athletes were exclusively used in the Olympics.,9.0,Anonymous,History
"OK, but nothing special","It was another Cinderella sports story, the same kind that we've seen a zillion times before. It may have been better than most, but that doesn't change the cookie-cutter feel.One jarring note, however, was the choice of Noah Emmerich as Craig Patrick. After taking so much trouble to have Kurt Russell look and act some much like Herb Brooks, why did they go out a pick Noah Emmerich to play Craig Patrick? Emmerich looks and acts nothing like Craig Patrick. It is jarring to see the plump guy with lots of hair playing a thin guy with no hair. It really was an irritation through the movie. The director said that Emmerich was a friend of his, so that's obviously the reason. Too bad he picked friendship over making the best possible movie.The best actor in the movie was the guy who played Mikhailov. His smirk when he first lined up against the US team was absolutely priceless.",6.0,Anonymous,History
We hit a moose,"Greetings again from the darkness.  So many sports movies fail because the sport action is unrealistic or is simply a series of close-ups.  ""Miracle"" works on so many levels, but the biggest surprise is the quality of the hockey action.  Many real hockey players were used in order to maintain the realism of the practices and games, and the young men are also wonderfully effective as characters within the film.  The key roles of Eruzione and Craig were perfectly captured and I dare you to guess which has an acting background!  Remarkably, this film works also from a historical basis and as a personal interest story AND, maybe most effectively, as a biographical sketch of the late Herb Brooks.  I have been a Kurt Russell fan for years, but have always ripped him for his selection of roles.  With a few exceptions (""Backdraft"" ""Tombstone"" are a couple) his choices have prevented him from reaching the same level as a Mel Gibson.  Somehow even Kevin Costner has had had greater box office success.  What a joke.  Russell appeals to men and women, is very charismatic on screen and is more athletic than most movie stars.  Too bad he hasn't had better judgement all these years.  The good news is, Russell BECOMES Herb Brooks in ""Miracle"".  I forgot it was Russell and watched as if this was all happening for the first time!  I do hope a year from now, he is remembered for an Oscar nomination. When you see this, please note what a terrific actress Patricia Clarkson is (""The Station Agent"" ""Pieces of April"")  She is so subtle in her mannerisms, yet so expressive.  Just a joy to watch.  So go see this one a couple of times ... it will leave you filled with emotion as you catch a glimpse of one of the biggest moments in U.S. history.

solid historical drama,"After a tumultuous decade, there is a ""crisis of confidence"" in America. University of Minnesota head coach Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell) is hired to coach the US hockey team for the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid. They are heavy underdogs. The Soviets even beat the NHL All Stars. The US team consists of amateurs who haven't got a job in the pros. Brooks intends to pick team players rather than individual stars. His assistant coach Craig Patrick (Noah Emmerich) is unconvinced. His marriage to Patti (Patricia Clarkson) suffers. He pushes his boys to the limit in training. With gas shortages and the new Iranian hostage crisis, there are few bright spots for America but this US team of underdogs will perform a miracle.This is a movie of great moments. There is nothing quite as compelling as the forced skate after tying the Norwegians. Kurt Russell is solid anchoring this movie. Maybe there's a limitation with the truth but this movie needs greater conflict. Somebody needs to be the villain who keeps threatening to take the team away from Herb. Also the players don't get enough attention. One player could be highlighted to fill out more drama. The players end up being all jumbo together. It would be nice to highlight one specific relationship of a player with Herb.",7.0,Anonymous,History
I GUESS YOU HAD TO BE THERE!,"The previous comment states that this is a Sports Movie and I would disagree with that limitation. I watched the original victory and it meant more than just a 'sporting event' to the people of the United States. It was an affirmation that no matter how 'mighty' the Soviet Union was, these young men were able to show that they could be stopped, that courage and determination could overcome brute strength.I remember the crippling recession, the gas lines, the invasion of Afghanistan and the Hostage Crisis. Young Americans by and large believed that eventually the Cold War would become Hot and we were all going to end up as radioactive waste. It's something that the post 9-11 mind seems to forget. My Mother, who was born in 1940, had grown up in the shadow of the bomb. My sisters and I were born and raised in Washington D.C. ~ the Ultimate Ground Zero. I remember how horrified the people from the University of Maryland were after they received the answers from the 15 year olds they polled about living in a First Strike Zone all of whom answered, ""We're happy to be here. We won't have to live through it and stumble around the wreckage blind and waiting to die while counting how many body parts have fallen off during the night!""This is more than a 'Sports Movie', it is a piece of History for those who choose to take the background events into consideration. It's also a testament to the power of dreams. I think the closing says it all, today's so-called Dream Teams have removed the wonder and the striving from the Olympics and left behind a shadow of the Miracles of the past.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Inspirational and really good, but not great.","MiracleThe story of the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team is one the greatest and most inspirational chapters of American sports history.  My feelings were a little mixed when I heard Disney was going to turn the story into one of their now trademark inspirational sports docudramas.  However, I came out of the film very impressed with the treatment and as cliché as it sounds, I was proud to be an American. The main anchor of this film is Kurt Russell as stoic U.S coach, Herb Brooks.  Russell delivers, arguably one the strongest performances of his career.  The other main stronghold of the film is in its montages.  The significance of the U.S. win to the country as a whole is made very evident by the use of stock news footage.  One of the only problems with Miracle is that you cannot help but feel manipulated while watching it.  Music comes in at just the right times and you get the mean eye from a Russian as soon as you need it.  It is not one of the all time great sports movies . . .

I believe in Miracles,"Oh this one gets me right in the feels. As a lifetime hockey fan, watching this is just such a treat and I can't help but feel it's one of the best sports movies ever. You get Kurt Russel in here as Coach Herb and, once again, Russel crushes it and creates this wonderful portrayal of a man that is so cold and direct on the surface but you know he's doing it all for the betterment of his players. The cast in general is really solid, so few people that I recognize from anything else and yet they're all solid in their respective roles.There are a few moments of over-the-top sentimentality, times when it feels manufactured. Like when they're doing drills at the end of a game until someone says he plays for Team America and it's meant to be this big emotional movement but it felt so telegraphed and heavy handed. All of that gets wiped away though when you hear the broadcasters at the end, watching that USA v Russia game and the original ""Do you believe in miracles!"" plays and I'm getting goosebumps just thinking about it and that is the sign of a well landed note.And now I wanna watch it again.

Very bad,"Quick summary: I didn't like this movie. It wasn't well-made. It contributed nothing to its genre or to cinema in general. It has resoundingly failed all three of my grading criteria for movies, so it deserves a 1 (which I rarely pass out, even to movies I hate).This movie is a bore from start to finish. It uses all the bad sports movie clichés and formulas--from crappy/overdone music to bad acting to pointless ""suspense"" shots to all sorts of little things that you find in every single sports movie.The characters are forgettable. The coach goes through what every coach does in a sports movie--he has a bad team to start out with, he's going up against ""unbeatable"" odds which we all know he'll end up beating, he has to kick someone off the team, etc. I about died watching this, it was so inane. I take offense at the studio head who actually thought this movie could entertain anyone who isn't a sports fanatic.Avoid this movie like the plague. It'll waste 2 hours of your life which you'll want to keep. If you must watch a sports movie, watch something memorable, like ""Bend it Like Beckham"" (the only sports movie I love, or even like). Even watch ""Remember the Titans"" again, because at least that deals with real issues.Miracle--a resounding 1/10",1.0,Anonymous,History
A great historical film,"At first I thought.... there is way too much dialog and way too little hockey (or humor) ... but that all changed in the second half of the movie which made the first half well worth the wait. Kurt Russell plays the no-nonsense Herb Brooks, the coach of the 1980 Olympic Hockey team that won the Olympic Gold. (Do you remember where you were?)I guess what most impressed me about the film was how amazing the editing and camera work was. I think it will count as a ""first"" in a lot of categories, not the least of which was camera work. The way they spliced the actual historical footage, (courtesy of the Olympic Committee) with the new footage and the actors, was so seamless and elegant, and the result was quite compelling and original. I don't think I've ever seen such well executed editing before, not even in the Hobbit movies ;-).The story itself was sweet and compelling. Kurt Russell was great, in that you come to a point where you really hate this bastard so much, you just want to say, ""No, You skate again you mother(bleep)er!"" I love the 70's haircuts and clothes and the accents.. the larger issues of the Cold War are not too fore fronted, but they are present enough that you see how important the win is for the US. Also, you see that his coaching really did pay off in the end: There is a point where the MC says, ""the US has never out-skated the Soviets like this before..."" and you recall the practice that Brooks makes them skate even after the rink has closed. (He was pretty brutal.) The Russian players are down-right frightening, so you get a real sense of what these kids are up against... they can hardly make eye contact they are so intimidated... but in the end, the ""eye scene"" as I call it, is enough to make even the biggest cynic, ""get veclemt"".Some people have called the film vapid nationalism (others are p***ed off because it was filmed entirely in Canada) but I think it was more about what a team of players (not any one individual or prima dona player) can do. It was also the last time a team of real amateurs actually won, before players became entertainers commanding million plus salaries, so I guess it has some important historical value.The film also has a real ""Indie"" feel. It stars all kinds of unknowns and has all kinds of low-budget effects, the scenes mostly taking place on the rink or in locker rooms. There are many moments when your heart breaks for some of the players and their families.I enjoyed it immensely and it sort of re-awakened my interest in hockey, which I'd long written off as too violent... Even the early fight scene between a player from Boston and Minnesota, which the coach encourages: ""Don't stop them,"" he says to his assistant coach, played awesomely by Noah Emmerich (remember, Jim Carey's best buddy in the Truman Show?)  is endurable when seen within the larger mission. Sadly this coach died in real life, according to the movie, before it was released... I guess he died just recently (and suddenly, though I don't know the whole story.)Anyhow I give it 8 out of 10 stars. A good and somewhat sad movie about a history that now seems too distant.",,Anonymous,History
Best Hockey Film of All Time!,"Kurt Russell should have an Oscar award nomination for his performance as Coach Herb Brooks, the coach for the American team who would compete against the undefeated Soviet Union whose players were all about winning full-time. Kurt Russell is perfect in this role. He has his mannerisms. The film has casted 20 players mostly college aged students to play the actual roles. Patricia Clarkson is perfect as Patty Brooks, the supportive and understanding wife. Al Michaels plays himself who was there when the team performed a miracle. It's a feel good film overall about overcoming the odds. It's a family too. It's also an educational film as well to teach a lesson about teamwork. There are no profanities or violence in it as well except the hockey scenes on the ice but that comes with the territory. It might be the best hockey film of all time.

A great example of motivational leadership.,"During the Winter Olympics of 1980, the United States men's Ice Hockey team did something no one believed they could. No one; except team coach Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell). This movie chronicles true events leading up to how a rag-tag team of underdogs went up against the mighty and hugely popular Soviet team.Having won the Olympic Gold just once in comparison to the Soviet's five-win streak, the US Olympic Committee has a herculean task in setting up a decent team, besides the obvious five-to-one odds of beating the Soviets. All this changes the day Herb Brooks signs on as head coach. From day one, his philosophy on beating the soviets was all about change - change in the way players think and act, including their attitude as sportsmen. Brilliantly portrayed by Russell, Brooks is not only a man on a mission; he turns out to be a fine line between a pathetic loss and a glorious win at the Olympics. To get his team in shape, Brooks starts practice sessions as early as six months prior to the opening ceremony- an approach that seemed unnecessary by many at the time. However, brook's real strategy was the psychological and physical grooming of his players. Part of this includes the psychosis of exactly what a player means to the team. As a whole, never has a message been driven so severely about teamwork than that embedded in this film.In the end, the results of the games become irrelevant, as the film is all about Brooks' methods of driving his team. In stark contrast to the film's title, the outcome was not caused by a miracle, rather, one man's vision and belief which translates into impeccable leadership that built a highly motivated team.It is indeed tragic that the real Herb Brooks passed away shortly before this film was released. But having worked with the cast and crew during production, I am sure his very presence on the sets was what added an authentic feel to this movie. While the underdog factor always remains a crowd pleaser in cinema, director Gavin O'Connor pulls this off without going overboard. By this I mean there are little or no special effects or moments that require the audience to suspend reality. Aiding O'Connor is the heavyweight script by Eric Guggenheim − a story that evades all the trappings of Hollywood and her tendency to blow things out of the water. You must appreciate the fact that Guggenheim has written a biopic of a period saga − a time when The US and USSR were still in a state of 'Cold War' and could have easily used the script as propaganda − a recurring Hollywood habit that seems to go well with some sections of the audience. Even so, the story does not loose focus on Brooks. Ironically, the film does not even show the final match against Finland, but revolves round the daunting obstacle of the Soviets. In essence, the story is a huge metaphor of not waiting for the cloud to pass, but to charge through the clouds to get to the silver lining.Together, O'Conner and Guggenheim have taken one of the greatest upsets in sporting history and made a simple film, yet one that is symbolically powerful in its message and narration. There are various other movies like ""Coach Carter"" or even the Academy Award Winning ""The Million Dollar Baby"" that serve as highly inspirational movies. Adding Miracle to that list will not only enrich your feel-good experience, it is a movie that has to be seen simply due to its historical significance in sporting history and how one man brought about that change.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Gavin O'Connor Skates on Thin Ice with Kurt Russell,"""Kurt Russell gives a brilliant performance as the dynamic and determined coach Herb Brooks, who had an impossible dream - beat the seemingly unbeatable Soviets at their own game. Starting with a handpicked group of 26 undisciplined kids, Brooks coached them to play like they never played before, and turned 20 of them into a team that believed they could achieve the unachievable - and in the process, united a nation with a new feeling of hope,"" according to the official studio synopsis.Based on a 1980 Olympic hockey play-off between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, this film makes the game in question political - with the opening collage providing a fine setting - but, it never ties its ends together. For Mr. Russell's character, the motivation is different; he is returning to the Olympics to revise a past snub, and vicariously prove his worth.

Russell Shines in Story of '80 Olympic Hockey Triumph...,"MIRACLE, the Disney retelling of the U.S. Hockey squad's astonishing Gold Medal performance at Lake Placid in 1980, is not a great film (a TV-movie from 1981, ""Miracle on Ice"", despite the bizarre casting of 69-year old Karl Malden as 43-year old coach Herb Brooks, is superior, although relying heavily on TV footage for game sequences), but it does offer Kurt Russell in one of the finest performances of his long career.The 53-year old Russell, a life-long veteran of both TV and film (making his debut on a ""Sugarfoot"" TV episode, at age 6), has developed a reputation over the past two decades as a very competent, if not overpowering leading man, primarily in action films (ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, TOMBSTONE, BREAKDOWN) and comedies (USED CARS, CAPTAIN RON, OVERBOARD). What is often forgotten, however, is that he has remarkable 'range' as an actor, with brilliant performances in the TV-movie ""Elvis"" (1979), the underrated SWING SHIFT (1984, where he met his long-time love, Goldie Hawn), and 2003's DARK BLUE (as a crooked cop searching for redemption during the bloody aftermath of the Rodney King riots in L.A.). As age has carved his features, Russell has lost the ""beach boy"" glamor that had often 'stereotyped' him in the past, and gives his 'Herb Brooks' a sense of credibility and pain that lifts his performance to Academy Award caliber.Herb Brooks was a remarkable person, long before Lake Placid. Despite success in coaching a string of national champion college hockey teams, he had never recovered from being the last player 'cut' from the 1960 Gold Medal U.S. hockey squad, and from being a member of the '64 and '68 teams that were humiliated by the Soviets. Driven by a desire to beat the nearly invincible Russian squad, he realized that a group of college 'all-stars' would never possess the 'team' skills to get the job done. Ruthlessly, refusing the assistance of the U.S. Olympic Hockey Committee, he pieced together a squad of talented skaters, 'broke' them, then remolded them to fit his vision, working them unmercifully for over six months, while spouting Vince Lombardi-like platitudes. Despite his torturous regimen, just days before the Olympics, his team would be humiliated by the Soviets, 10-3, and no one gave his squad a chance for a medal.But Brooks had faith, and a squad that was 'hungry'...While the film suffers from a lack of depth in the portrayal of the players (by the way, they do all their own skating; TV footage is not used), MIRACLE's 'feel' of the decade is well-done, using montages and voice-overs to convey the American sense of helplessness in a decade of tragedies. The unexpected U.S. victory galvanized the nation (Al Michaels' stunned reaction, ""Do you believe in Miracles?"", has become a catch phrase for both the game, and the times), and actually contributed to turning the country around.While the Academy Awards will probably ignore Kurt Russell's commanding performance (as the film was not a 'hit'), MIRACLE is still a film worth viewing, given our own troubled times. While the film may not be 'great', it's message of hope is certainly worthwhile!",,Anonymous,History

I remember how inspired my entire family was when it happened, because so many other things were happening in our country that were negative.  Watching this movie brought all of that back.  The movie not only did a convincing job showing us how the team was formed and trained by their coach, but also showing how the country desperately needed something or someone to give us hope that things could get better.  I felt that pride and hope all over again watching the movie, and I was only ten the first time. That's how good this movie is!The casting for this movie was brilliant.  Kurt Russell was perfect.  But the best was the casting of the hockey team.  These were actual hockey players, playing hockey players.  Sure, some of them were also actors, like Eddie Caghill, but he had to audition as a hockey player, not an actor.  And it worked.  The hockey scenes were so good, and some of those hockey players were not only very good actors, but downright good looking too.  I was impressed, and I tend to be very critical of actors, since my background is performance in theater and film.  These boys did great playing hockey and acting.  Bravo, boys!  Bravo!So, if you haven't seen this movie, see it.  You won't be disappointed.Rank: 10",10.0,Anonymous,History
Kurt Russell is superb,"I do love a sports drama, which is fortunate as Disney sure do a lot of them!'Miracle' is very good, as it details the events of the 1980 Winter Olympics between the hockey teams of the US and the USSR. The constant connections to world events can feel a little forced in parts, but I entirely get what they were going for - it doesn't hamper things at all, anyway.Kurt Russell is superb as Herb Brooks, he's far and away the best and most interesting character/actor onscreen. Russell nails the role. Elsewhere, Noah Emmerich does a solid job, as do those who portray the players - even if none of them stick in my memory much.The score is strong, as are most things about this film. It probably goes on for a tad too long, they could've cut thirty minutes without losing anything major. It doesn't drag though, to its credit.In conclusion, this 2004 production is 100% worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,History
An effective inspirational sports drama,"Sports aren't really my thing, but every once in a while I enjoy watching a sports movie. This one in particular is a great one despite following Disney's formula almost to the letter. Often, it's not the ideas in a movie that make the difference, but their execution, and that couldn't be more true here. MIRACLE is the story of how the USA came from behind to defeat the USSR in the 1980 Winter Olympics. I already knew how things would end, but for me that didn't matter. It was great to see fantastic performances from the entire cast and the development of a diverse group of individuals into a cohesive team under the leadership and guidance of Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell). It gets off to a bit of a slow start, but once the focus shifts from team-building to the excitement of playing hockey things really took off. The only thing that kind of drags the film down is a subplot involving a conflict between Herb Brooks and his wife (Patricia Clarkson), but mainly for pacing reasons. I still thought it added depth to Herb's character overall. I should also give props to the soaring musical score which effectively sell the emotional highs. When all is said and done, this is a great film that speaks to America's strength in times of adversity. I'm not one to buy the myth of American exceptionalism hook, line and sinker, but I do acknowledge that we need inspiration from time to time and this film definitely delivers it. Highly recommended for sports fans, or people who like inspirational films.",7.0,Anonymous,History
cool movie,"The director of Miracle is Gavin O'Connor, main characters are Herb brooks, Patti Brooks, Craig Patrick,Jim Craig, Mike Eruzione, Jack O'Callahan, Rob McClanahan, Ralph Cox,Mark Johnson,Dave Slik, Mike Ramsey,etc. I'm not a really big fan of hockey but this was a good movie. I liked how they went from losing every game to winning all and beating the Soviet Union. I liked how they played for different teams and at they end they all got along, and put their differences aside. I was crazy how hard coach Herb was on the team but it was worth it. I've seen this movie before I would watch it again in or outside of school, and I would recommend people to watch it especially if they like hockey or just any sporting event.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Even based on an inspiring true story, the film lacks depth in the characters and a direction that fails to extract the full potential of the narrative","""Miracle"" is a 2004 film directed by Gavin O'Connor that tells the story of the United States ice hockey team, known as the ""Miracle Team"", during the 1980 Winter Olympics. Set in real events and received some positive attention upon release, the film has some significant flaws.The plot revolves around trainer Herb Brooks, played by Kurt Russell. Brooks is a determined and dogged coach who seeks to build a team capable of taking on the mighty players of the Soviet Union, which dominated ice hockey at the time. He believes that with a lot of hard work and discipline he can unite the players and turn them into a winning team. The film shows the selection of players and the intense preparation for the Olympic Games. Herb Brooks imposes rigorous and challenging training on the players, seeking to extract the best from each one and forge a united and competitive team. During this process, there are conflicts between the players, rivalries, and resistance to Brooks' unorthodox tactics.Although the plot is based on real events and tells an inspiring story of overcoming, it is important to mention that the film takes some artistic liberties and simplifies some aspects of the real story to create a more accessible and emotionally engaging narrative. ""Miracle"" offers a predictable, clichéd narrative. The plot focuses mainly on the preparation and performance of the American team during the Olympic Games, but fails to deeply and engagingly explore the individual stories of the players. The characters are underdeveloped and lacking in nuance, which makes it difficult to connect emotionally with the audience.The plot is divided into three main segments. At the beginning of the film, we are introduced to coach Herb Brooks, played by Kurt Russell, and his determination to build a competitive team to represent the United States at the 1980 Winter Olympics. Through flashbacks, we are introduced to Brooks' story as a player hockey and his unconventional approach to coaching. The film quickly establishes the conflict between Brooks and the traditional expectations of players and the ice hockey community.In the middle segment, we see the intense process of selecting and training the team. Brooks implements rigorous training tactics, challenging players physically and mentally. Tension builds as the players' personalities clash and rivalries develop. Through intense training sequences and emotional game scenes, the film captures the evolution of the team, showing their transformation from a group of individuals to a cohesive unit. The film also explores the political context of the Cold War, with the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union reflected in the confrontation between ice hockey teams. The climax of the middle segment is the historic showdown between the United States and the Soviet Union in the semifinals, highlighting the tension and emotion of the game and the director's ability to create a sense of anticipation and suspense.The film's final segment culminates in the epic game between the United States and the Soviet Union known as the ""Miracle on Ice"". The film deftly portrays the match, capturing the intensity of the game and the American players' determination to overcome the odds. The direction creates an electrifying atmosphere, conveying the sense of pride and patriotism that surrounded the actual event. The film culminates with the United States' emotional victory over the Soviet Union, followed by winning the Olympic gold medal. The moment is portrayed with a mixture of emotion, triumph and celebration. The film concludes with a final narration that highlights the lasting impact of the Miracle Team and its legacy of inspiration and resilience. In general, the movie ""Miracle"" uses the beginning to establish the characters and conflicts, the middle to show the evolution of the team and the challenges faced, and the end to deliver the emotional catharsis of victory and the feeling of triumph. The skillful direction and solid acting contribute to the viewer's immersion in the story and the journey of the characters.Technically speaking, the film does not stand out. The cinematography is conventional and lacks visual innovation. The hockey scenes are well-executed, but they're lacking in truly emotional or exciting moments. Furthermore, the soundtrack is generic and unmemorable, not contributing to building suspense or tension. As for Gavin O'Connor's direction, he fails to extract the maximum potential from the story and characters. The direction is competent, but it lacks a distinctive touch that makes the film memorable. Moments of drama and tension often seem forced, and the lack of depth in the dialogues undermines the actors' interpretation.Gavin O'Connor opted for a conventional, straightforward approach, focusing primarily on Coach Herb Brooks' journey and the formation of the Miracle Team. O'Connor sought to convey the intensity and passion of the sport, using well-choreographed and realistic ice hockey scenes. An interesting choice of direction was to portray the main characters as ordinary individuals rather than renowned players or superstars. This helped to create an easier identification with the team, emphasizing the collective and overcoming aspect to the detriment of the individual highlight. The production adopted a sober visual aesthetic, with a cold color palette that refers to the environment of ice and winter. The cinematography doesn't present great innovations, but manages to convey the energy and speed of the hockey game, providing some exciting scenes during matches.The film explores the political context of the late 1970s and early 1980s, with the rivalry and tension between the two countries, establishing the political and symbolic importance of sporting confrontations. Victory over the Soviet Union in the hockey game becomes an iconic moment, transcending sport and representing a triumph of American values and freedom over the Soviet system. ""Ice Defiance"" portrays the climate of the Cold War, highlighting the atmosphere of distrust and intense competition between the United States and the Soviet Union. The film references historical events such as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, which heightened tension between the two countries and triggered a global political crisis. The game between the United States and the Soviet Union at the 1980 Olympics takes place in this context, and the film shows how the sporting confrontation was widely interpreted as a symbolic clash between the values of the Western world and the Soviet bloc. The film highlights the patriotism and spirit of unity that permeated the country during this period. Miracle Team players are portrayed as heroes who embody the American values of determination, teamwork, and perseverance. The film shows how the Miracle Team brought the country together, transcending social, political and cultural barriers. The victory over the Soviet Union served as a shot in the arm and national pride at a time when the United States was facing a series of internal and external challenges.As far as behind-the-scenes trivia goes, during the filming of ""Miracle,"" the actors who played the Miracle Team players had to undergo intense ice hockey training. They were mentored by professional players and former Olympians to learn the techniques and moves of the sport in order to make their performances more authentic. In addition, director Gavin O'Connor and the production team had access to the archives and records of the 1980 Winter Olympics to ensure historical accuracy in recreating the matches and uniforms worn by the US team. Another curiosity is that some of the real players from the 1980 Miracle Team made cameos in the film. Mike Eruzione, captain of the winning team, played himself in an emotional scene where coach Herb Brooks hands him the responsibility of leading the team. These elements contributed to the creation of an exciting and engaging narrative, despite the film's limitations in other respects.Casting the ""Miracle"" movie was a careful process, aiming to find actors who could convincingly portray the Miracle Team players and capture the essence of the real characters. As for Kurt Russell's performance, he was selected for the role of trainer Herb Brooks. Russell is an actor known for his versatility and ability to play strong and charismatic characters. His choice to play Herb Brooks was based on his ability to convey the determination and intensity needed to portray the iconic trainer, and in preparing for the role, Kurt Russell studied Herb Brooks' characteristics and coaching style, as well as his approach motivation for the team. He also had the opportunity to meet Brooks in person before his death, which helped deepen his understanding of the character and establish a personal connection with him. The actor managed to convey the nuances and complexities of the character, highlighting his relentless determination and his pursuit of perfection in the sport. His convincing performance contributed to the film's emotional impact and conveyed the central message of resilience and teamwork.In terms of repercussions, ""Miracle"" got a mixed response from the public and critics. While it was praised for depicting an important historical event and celebrating the spirit of self-improvement, the film was criticized for its lack of originality and emotional depth. While it had some appeal among sports fans and American patriots, it did not become a classic of the sports genre. It's a film that fails to go beyond the conventions of the sports genre. Despite being based on an inspiring true story, the film lacks depth in the characters, technical aspects that are not very striking and a direction that fails to extract the full potential of the narrative. At the end of the day, ""Miracle"" is a forgettable film and does not stand out among other films in the same genre.",6.0,Anonymous,History
What a coach...,"""Miracle"" is a Biography - Sport movie which is based on the true story of Herb Brooks. He was the coach who led the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team to victory over the Soviet squad which back then was simply impossible to be defeated.I enjoyed this movie because it is based on true events and on a real life person who was very important in hockey. The direction which was made by Gavin O'Connor was exceptional and he presented us very well the mentality of Herb Brook and what he had to do in order for his team to succeed. He also presented very good the struggle of the players and the tough training they had to do in order to prove to Herb Brooks that they are worthy. I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie because it is a hockey lesson and I believe that even if you are not a jockey fan you will love this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent Movie,"Miracle is an excellent movie about the greatest moment in sports history. You have to understand the game of hockey to really appreciate this movie. I believe why more people did not see Miracle is because they do not understand the game of hockey or choose not to understand it. The acting was top-notch in Miracle, especially Kurt Russell. He did a great job as Herb Brooks. I have always been a Kurt Russell, but I believe this was his best part. If you haven't seen this movie, I encourage you to go see it, you will witness something great. I do wish Herb Brooks could have been alive to see this movie, but remember he was a part of the real thing. Overall, I give this movie a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Blatant jingoism aside, it's an effective crowd-pleaser","This film succeeds solely because of a sensationally good turn by Kurt Russell as Herb Brooks. It's easily Russell's best performance. He so thoroughly embodies Brooks' persona that it's easy to forget we're watching an actor.There's also wonderful supporting by from Patricia Clarkson as Herb's wife, Patty. Russell and Clarkson have tremendous chemistry together and create an utterly believable relationship on screen. And Noah Emmerich turns in a nicely understated performance as Craig Patrick.The film doesn't delve too much into the players themselves. Which is a pity, because they come off an interchangeable. But, then again, the filmmakers and Disney weren't going for a piercing study, they were aiming for a crowd-pleaser.Of course, since the game with the Soviets was ""more than just a game,"" the film ratchets up the jingoism to give us an idea of what those 20 young men were playing for. So we're treated to the customary cornball moments - the flag-waving, the repeated chants of ""USA!"" and the exhausted player who, during a grueling workout session after a game in Norway, yells out with nationalistic pride.The film's about 20 minutes too long, but the excitement builds well in the third act. The ""Miracle on Ice"" game takes 21 minutes and they're exhilarating, adrenaline-pumping moments. Although we know the ending, it's impossible not to get drawn into the game, thanks to some terrific editing. When I saw this film in a theatre, many patrons literally were on the edge of their seats, biting their fingernails and, then, cheering when Al Michaels exclaimed, ""Do you believe in miracles?""""Miracle"" is one of those films that aims to make you feel good about yourself, fellow man and the country. If that's the kind of entertainment you're looking for, then this film definitely is for you. It doesn't challenge the viewer in any way, shape or form. But, dammit, the film is entertaining for the most part.Unfortunately, now that professional players have bastardized the Olympics - is it really exciting to watch the Jaromir Jagrs, Mario Lemieuxes, Kobe Bryants, Michael Jordans and Jennifer Capriatis in the Olympics? - we know we'll never experience another moment like this again.As Russell's voice-over at the end aptly points out, ""Now that we have Dream Teams, we seldom get to dream anymore."" And that's a real shame.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Yet another feel-good ""determined coach/athlete"" drama from Disney. (spoilers)","Released in 2004, Miracle was probably quickly turned out in response to Hollywood's almost-compulsive need for ultra-patriotic feel-good movies. For Disney, they never seem to get tired of the story of the determined coach, athlete, and team drama, since they have been producing almost one a year (with previous ones being Rookie, and, among one of the better ones--Meet the Titans). This one is based on Herb Brooks, a former Olympic hopeful for the US hockey team who is now coaching a new team of potential Olympic hopefuls for the US team who is set to challenge the Russian in the Cold-War era (this centering on the 1980 Olympics).A major problem with this film, despite it being ritual at this point, is the pacing. I'm not sure whether it was the intention of the filmmakers to focus solely on the dynamics of Herb Brooks, who patiently tries to piece together a sound team of players, or whether it was the intention to focus on the work of the entire team who eventually went on to defeat the Russians. If it was the latter, than the pacing killed it. Even despite the little individual dramas that arise among the players, almost none of it is given much interesting detail. Almost none of it is really entertaining or meaningful. It is just kind of like...here is player X, you will know him because of this characteristic. We never really get much understanding of how the players were dynamic in and of themselves as though filmmakers were reluctant to add more detail beyond the making of Herb Brooks's character. The result of this being, a movie about an important figure in sports history (at least by the understanding of the filmmakers who chose to make a film about Brooks) that is intertwined with all of these other really unimportant people and even more standardized moments of hockey action.The almost mundane portrayal of the historical importance of Herb Brooks is the result of far too much standardization. The consequence of Hollywood's inability to depart from convention.",3.0,Anonymous,History

But Herb Brooks was able to put together a hockey team of primarily college players to pull off this gigantic upset.Most of the hockey players in this movie were played by actual hickey players to make the hockey games seem realistic and didn't have a bunch of fake hockey scenes played by actors with nothing more then a crash course in playing hockey.",10.0,Anonymous,History

If you watch a film like Youngblood after Miracle, you'll just want to strangle yourself. EX-NHL player Ryan Walter has made a fantastic job in dramatizing the goals and the actual match events that took place. It annoyed me that some other events were changed from what actually happened to boost the American over-patriotism and alleged unity as well as making others, especially the Soviets to look like ""The bad guys."" However that was something to be expected and we see it in pretty much every film, especially war films.To sum it up, the film is not to be taken as a documentary of what happened but rather as good hockey entertainment.

Not Bad at All,"Movies on this kind of feel-good subject matter (especially when you know how it's going to turn out) can really only be SO good... but such an uplifting story can also only be SO bad.  It's a great story with interesting characters (particularly Herb Brooks), inspiring and worth retelling.  This movie could have been a lot more slick and manipulative, and to the director's credit it's not.  In spite of his bad wig (Patricia Clarkson, who plays his wife Patty, has a pretty bad one too), Kurt Russell is quite solid as Coach Brooks.  He's one of those leaders who declares early on, ""I'm not here to be your friend,"" but of course earns the love and respect of every guy on the team.  The guys -- all unknown or little-known actors -- are good (and look pretty authentically like I remember guys that age looking in 1979-80), though of course there is little individual character development.  It is nice to get to know Jimmy Craig, the goalie, over the course of the movie, because it becomes quite clear that he pretty much saved the big game.  The Russians had a million shots on goal and he blocked all but two. Overall, ""Miracle"" is a solid movie with a story that's worth revisiting. The period details are spot-on and even though the ending is no secret, it's quite inspiring.",7.0,Anonymous,History

This is an outstanding movie!!!",9.0,Anonymous,History
Well-done tribute but....,"From reading other reviews, I think the merits of the movie have been pretty much covered so I will concentrate on a few areas that were missing, or just could have been done better. Heading into the 1980 Lake Placid games, America was coming off of the worst economic decade since the Great Depression, with high unemployment and high inflation. Gas prices (where you could get gas) were at all- time highs. American pride was still stinging from Vietnam, Watergate, the Iran hostage crisis and the Cold War with the Soviet Union. Americans needed Lake Placid to, if even for a moment, give them something to cheer for. At the beginning of Miracle, there is a brief montage that attempts to frame the events of February 1980 in terms of the political, economic and social issues that Americans faced. However, the movie comes up a bit short in terms of conveying the severity of the state that America was in at the time, and the general lack of confidence in the future. Miracle also did not do enough to emphasize just how good the Soviet team was. In fact, the statement by Herb Brooks in his pre-game speech, ""their time is over"" actually leads the uneducated viewer to think that the 1980 Soviets were a once-great team that was reaching the end of its dominance. Not true. The Soviets won gold in '56, '64, '68, '72, '76, '84 and '88. They would continue to dominate world hockey for another decade after the Miracle on Ice, and nothing less than the fall of the Soviet Union would be required to eventually dismantle them. They had, by far, the two best players in the world at their positions in Vladislav Tretiak (G) and Boris Mikhailov (RW). As was shown in the movie, the Soviets made a mockery of Team USA in an exhibition 3 days before the Olympics. The score was 10-3 but could have (and by all accounts should have) been much worse. Years later, Soviet coach Viktor Tikhonov wondered if that result may have caused his team to take the Americans lightly when it actually counted. In stark contrast to the Soviets, Team USA was patchwork bunch of college kids of varying levels of skill and experience, and although some of them would go on to play in the NHL, there were certainly no Gretzky or Lemieux caliber players on the 1980 team. Director Gavin O'Connor certainly conveys to the viewer the notion that the Soviets were the best team in the world at the time, but should have gone perhaps a bit further to show just how far removed the Soviet hockey team was from the rest of the world; they were simply in a different world. Overall, Miracle was a well-done tribute to the 1980 Men's hockey team. However, it doesn't quite capture the epic effect that one single game had on a psychologically and emotionally exhausted nation. So profound and unlikely was that victory that the International Ice Hockey Federation called it the #1 Top Story of the 20th Century, and Sports Illustrated ranked the Miracle on Ice the #1 Sports Moment of the 20th Century.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Great event, good movie","A great movie has to be great in a number of ways, great plot, great acting, great directing, etc.  This movie definitely had a great plot that will resonate with US audiences.  The rest of the movie however was only good to so-so.  None of the acting performances particularly stuck out as being outstanding, but none of them were bad either.Basically this movie just tells the story event by event, unfortunately this means that a lot of the characters fall by the wayside.  For instance, when the final cut was made it was hard to feel bad about it because the player/character wasn't well developed.All that being said this is a good movie overall.  The story is the classic scrappy little guy beats the big bad guy which is a story that is hard to have fail.  It is even harder to mess up when it is a true story.

My other favorite scene is when the team is in their locker room and Herb ask Ramsey who we are playing (Sweden). Then looks at Mac and they just start yelling at each other and Herb gets Mac all worked up and says that will get him going. I love that I wish Herb lived to see this awesome movie.

Do you believe in miracles?,"One of my earliest clear sports memory was the hockey game between the US and USSR. I don't remember their names from back then--I've been reminded from articles, stories, and ESPN's replays of the game--but I remember the game, the upset, the excitement on TV. It is the game that made me the hockey fan I am today. I was just shy of ten, so I didn't appreciate the bigger picture of the game.Now that I'm older, I have a greater understanding of history, the Cold War, and hockey. So when Disney's 'Miracle' came out, I looked forward to seeing it. It is the story of how Herb Brooks assembled a team of college hockey players--almost all of whom were from Minnesota and Boston area colleges--to compete against the world's greatest teams from Northern and Eastern Europe, some of which had been playing together for a decade.The movie opened with news clips from the turbulent 1970s, starting with the war in Vietnam through the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. It was one of the darkest times in American history, and we needed something to be proud of.Kirk Russell played Brooks, the coach of the young American team who was the last player cut from the 1960 Gold Medal Team. He recreated Brooks perfectly, from his clothes to his accent to his mannerisms. Oddly, as Brooks used amateur players, director Gavin O'Connor used mostly amateur actors for the movie. All but Eddie Cahill, who played goalie Jim Craig, had no acting experience at all. They were hockey players who learned how to act on the fly. Despite that, the acting was quite good. And Disney got Al Michaels and Ken Dryden to reprise their roles as themselves announcing the game.In the titles after the movie, we learn where the players are and what they do now. Only a few of the twenty players made it to the NHL, and only two or three are still affiliated with organized hockey now.

Disney-ized version of the story,"Check out the HBO documentary Miracle on Ice or the 1981 Karl Malden version before watching this one.Herb Brooks was a very intense, emotional man whose language doesn't fit into the Disney universe. Unfortunately, the Kurt Russell character seems more like the Emilio Estevez coach in Mighty Ducks.Overall the film does a good job in recreating the 1980 miracle but it does not satisfy this viewer with the raw emotion that was so palpable in 1980.The HBO documentary is much better in delivering the story and has interviews with the players, Herb Brooks and Al Michaels.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Miracle: 5/10,"I don't really understand Disney's viewpoint of sports movies. Their three main ones, Remember the Titans, The Rookie, and now Miracle, are all similar and different. All of them have underdogs that come up from below to win, but each has a separate quality to them, which I will get to later.Coach Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell), who was taken out right before the 1960 Olympics, where the USA won the gold medal in hockey, is hired to coach the 1980 Olympic team. He takes 21 ""rag-tag misfits"" and tries to put them together as a team to defeat the previously unbeatable Soviet team. Will they be able to do it? Well, considering the title of the movie is Miracle, and it wouldn't be a miracle if the people who have won for the last twenty years won....Remember the Titans worked because it dealt with more than the sport; it had racial issues added to it, adding another layer to it. Also, the cliché of ""rag-tag misfits coming together to win the big game"" worked in that movie, because it focused on general characters, while in Miracle, there wasn't really anything below the surface. Eric Guggenheim's debut script tries to borrow off of other sports movies by attempting to have both interesting subplots involving the coach AND the players...sadly, neither of them work out.The Rookie was great because it showed the protagonist's inner conflict. While Brooks didn't really have any inner conflicts, anything involving the coach was barely fleshed out, and just whatever information we needed was given randomly. It's obvious that Miracle ""borrowed"" from those movies, but it's nowhere near as good as they are.Russell is great, though, contrasting the rest of the movie. As the hard-as-nails coach, this might be the performance to really put him into the public's eye. Although the script doesn't put any backstory for him, it's obvious that Russell put hard work into portraying this character. Patricia Clarkson is wasted as his wife, who seems upset that her husband is always away, but name a recent movie in which Clarkson plays someone who isn't upset. All of the people who play the hockey players do what they need to do: skate.I suppose Disney had trouble keeping this movie at a PG. Because whatever fight scenes there were, they were extremely tame. It looked like two figure skaters walking around each other. I don't exactly call that ""rough sports action"". On the other hand, this movie had way too many uses of the word ""hell"", it's probably just Guggenheim's favorite word. Although I'm not a big sports fan, I enjoyed some of the hockey action. It's not exciting, because it's obvious who wins, but it's fun to watch.If you go to see the overlong Miracle (in which 30 minutes could have easily been taken out), see it for Russell's performance, or just sneak into it at the end where most of the hockey action is, because there's nothing for the first hour and a half that's that good.My rating: 5/10Rated PG for language and some rough sports action.",5.0,Anonymous,History

Great Movie,"This is one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. The fact that they used real hockey players makes a world of difference. I also like the fact that this is a true story and the directors did a good job of keeping it true with the help of Herb Brooks and members of the real 1980 Olympic team. Even Al Michaels said that he when he watched the movie, he would forget that this was not the real game (and he was the one calling the game at the Olympics in 1980).What I don't understand is people making comments about this movie who clearly state that they are not sports fans. Of course they wouldn't get it. It's about believing in the power of teamwork and working hard to accomplish a mutual dream. You don't have to be a ""hockey"" fan to appreciate this movie. It's a movie that leaves you feeling good, and we need that right now... just like we needed it back then.I understand why the director wanted to show Herb's family life, but I thought those scenes with his wife just slowed things down. Guess I was just more interested in the dynamics of the hockey team.See this movie... you won't be sorry.",10.0,Anonymous,History
what a movie,"Great movie. It's hard to recreate the magic of a once-in-a-lifetime event, but Miracle comes pretty close.It succeeds in recapturing the spirit of the times, the personality of coach Herb Brooks, the tension of the game, and the exhilaration of Al Michaels' famous call as the clock went to 0:00. While there are plenty of minor things I could quibble about, Miracle's ability to recapture the spirit of the Soviet upset makes it a success.A movie about this subject could easily have been a stinker, but Miracle isn't that at all. It's a great sports movie that suffers only in comparison to the real story. I gave it 9/10.",,Anonymous,History

You Ess Eh! You Ess Eh!,"I don't like words like genius or miracle. Yet to my disdain these are popular words that get thrown around with reckless abandon. These days practically everyone with a pulse is a genius and anything remotely positive ends up labeled a miracle. I suppose we need something to believe in in these days, so it shouldn't come as a surprise hyperbole is becoming as common as hybrids on our roadways.Nobody wants to believe in miracles (or geniuses) more than Americans and if there aren't any immediately available, then why not revisit the past where the almighty red, white and blue shone like a blinding beacon of hope. No bigger evil comes to mind (with heartfelt apologies to terrorists) than the big red evil of the former Soviet Union and there's no better metaphor for winning the Cold War than beating those damn Russkies on a frozen sheet of ice where men do battle with skates and sticks. Yes I'm talking about hockey and if the Americans know one thing about hockey that would surely be that they beat the Commies at the 1980 Olympics (and went on to win the gold medal). In fact, I think it may very well be the only thing Americans know about hockey.It may be almost 30 years since the Team U.S.A. underdogs pulled off this major upset, but calling hard work, orchestrated team work and a refusal to quit a miracle is the equivalent of calling Gavin O'Connor's Miracle a masterpiece. Masterpiece status aside, the on-ice action is exceptionally well shot, with an incredible attention to detail and authenticity. Perhaps the best things about this movie is the director's decision to cast real hockey players in all the major roles, all of whom not only do an impressive job of acting, they also take on the brunt of all the stunt work.Typical of the sports melodrama genre, Miracle suffers from a few too many moments of pulled heart strings. The one trick O'Connor goes to too many times are the telegraphed reaction shots of secondary characters in the crowd. Annoyingly, Goaltender Jim Craig's father gets so many of these shots you can't help but pray for a deflected puck to pluck him in his sickingly over expressive face. On top of that, O'Connor makes an odd choice of closing the movie with an overly weighty voice over from Russell, a choice that practically undermines the relatively straight faced restraint characteristic of the rest of the movie. All in all, this is an entertaining movie, especially for hockey fans. A miracle? Not quite, but definitely something worth cheering about.http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,History
A tribute to the USA hockey triumph,"Miracle is the story of the 1980 US Olympic hockey team's triumph over the tough and professional USSR. Miracle starts from Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell) taking the coaching job, with his vision of what it would take to beat the Soviets in the Olympics. The players he picks are not the obvious choices, not necessarily superstars, but they are the choices that he feels will fit that vision of winning. Kurt Russell buries himself in this role--he IS Herb Brooks from Minnesota, with a very convincing mid-western accent. The story does a good job of setting up the importance of this triumph. Not everyone likes or gets sports, but this movie shows that whatever this event was, it was no mere game. It was a shot in the arm for the country at a time when it needed it. The film is a great tribute to a remarkable achievement.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Disney doing what they do best with this sort of material.,"It's a feel good sports movie based around the true story of Coach Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell) who had the unenviable task of leading the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team in the Winter Olympics at Lake Placid. Where the all conquering Russian squad were waiting.We follow Brooks as he assembles a youthful squad then pushes them to the limits, mentally and physically, all while facing pressures in his home life as he gives his all on the ice rinks. If you know your sports history then there's obviously no surprise factor here, but there's good insight into squad dynamics, of coaching and toughness involved in the many facets of high level sport. Russell leads his young cast admirably, while the action scenes during the matches have a kinetic energy that's most impressive. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
"The real story is/was so good, that the movie's streamlining didn't help.","I am big fan of college & Olympic hockey -- it is so much more pure and meaningful than the 80 game clutch & grab seeding schedule before the Stanley Cup playoffs.  I go to 10+ games a year and I applaud the raw love for the game that college players exhibit.Over the last 5 years ABC/ESPN (owned by Disney or didn't you know) has spent $600Million on the television rights to NHL hockey.  The effort has been a dismal failure for both sides.  Ratings have fallen during that period (as players' salaries have skyrocketed) and hockey is now watched in as many homes as Arena Football.  So, perhaps we can understand the motivation of Disney releasing this movie at the current time of year.That being said, the story of the 1980 US Olympic Hockey team is one of sports' greatest.  For a more traditional, and a bit less melodramatic retelling, see HBO Productions, ""Do You Believe in Miracles?"".  It does a very credible job of blending the USA hockey team (the players and their stories) with the ""back story"" of 1980 and America's malaise. It also points out some interesting tidbits such as the US-Russian game was NOT televised live, the final with Finland was just as important as the game with Russia, and even includes interviews with the Russian players to get THEIR points of view.Miracle was a reasonable, workmanlike dramatic recreation of the events (and Kurt Russell was great as Herb Brooks) but it was way too ""clean"".  If you don't know anything about hockey, it probably doesn't matter, but if you do, you'll be surprised that: 1) every face-off is at center ice 2) icing & off-sides do not occur. 3) pucks are always deflected by goalies and never smothered. 4) shots on goal always come from hard slap shots or one-timers and never through deflections, screens & rebounds. 5) (Except for once), penalties and power plays don't exist.The real story is so dramatic that the movie didn't really add much to what happened.",5.0,Anonymous,History

"The USA hockey team completes the ""miracle on ice"" on February 24th, 1980","America had been dealing with the turbulent 1970s, with a war going on, lying Presidents, oil shortages, lame-duck Presidents, nuclear accidents, Iran-Contra and they just needed something to cheer for, as they headed into the 1980s. At least, that's what the opening credits of this film wished to convey to us. This now modern classic is a biopic of sorts, of how the USA hockey team, beat all the odds at the 1980 Winter Olympics. No matter what era you see/saw this film, it immediately puts your frame of mind into this period piece, set in the summer of 1979.The main focus of the film is how Coach Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell), assembles a collection of players, who don't necessary meet the talent levels, but do meet the psychological, guts and smarts, to be champions. After studying the styles of the Russians and the Canadians, he is sure he can have much better success at winning the gold medal, if he uses those styles, with an American twist. Hockey fans will really enjoy this one.This is where the biopic part of the film comes in. We do get to learn a lot about Russell's Herb and his wife, Patti's (Patricia Clarkson), lives, that they had during this time. We know the motivations that lead Herb to this point in history. We learn the turmoil it put upon his wife and family. Director, Gavin O'Connor, does not hold back the notion, that some of Herb's colleagues thought he was a little crazy. That this unorthodox way to coach a team, was not the way to go. It is that struggle to win over everyone else around him, that weighs in on Russell's character. It is as strong as winning the gold medal and it is felt throughout the entire film.Gavin O'Connor, directs the hockey action quite clean and full of energy. The tension felt through the most pivotal games in the film, is felt heavily by the audience. The pain of the players coming from the screen, realistic game action and cast performances are a welcomed view from this group of young actors. I thought the secondary characters could have been fleshed out a little bit more, but this film accomplishes its ""goal"", by creating a modern classic, about a strange time in our history, that needed a spark.7.9 (B- MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Anyway, with the hockey scenes they used great camera angles to actually create the emotion which is totally awesome. Most other hockey movies, let alone any other sport movie, never got this close to the action. Also to get 'inside' of the players and coach's mind, to see what was really going on in their heads.

"After 24 years, this story still makes me scream YES!","Miracle, Disney's latest sports biopic, scores a hat trick. Kurt Russell as a stifled Herb Brooks plus 20 kids who can skate and understand the position of the 1980 US Olympic hockey plus the inevitable ending is a powerful package that I will watch again, and again. Russell seems to have morphed into Brooks and his spartan portrayal is mesmerizing. Brooks was known as a man of great ideas and few words; Russell brings those traits to life on the screen without going over the edge. I have always thought his talents have been wasted on a lot of throw away parts; this one is worthy of him. The on-screen team, including Buzz Schneider's son Billy playing his father, are great skaters. Their Olympic counterparts worked their butts off in 7 months of drills, and these kids look as though they could have kept up with them. The moment when Al Michaels said, ""Do you believe in miracles?"" in 1980, I did. When he said it again in the movie, I remembered how it felt 24 years ago, and it was as good now as it was then.",,Anonymous,History

It is truly sad that Herb Brooks was killed in a car crash just a few weeks before the theatrical release of this film. The world is just not the same without him around. He will be sorely missed.

this movie was amazing: saw it 3 times,"This movie is an absolute must-see, hockey fan or not.  Kurt Russell nails the role of Herb Brooks, the coach of the 1980 US Hockey Team.  Kurt Russell deserves an Oscar.  He portrays Herb Brooks as a normal guy who knows how to press the right buttons and how far he can push his players.  Herb Brooks was an extremely demanding coach, and even though I wasn't around in 1980, I know a ton about the event and know how Brooks acted.  This movie follows the team from day 1 of then whole process.  The actors who portrayed the players in the movie were mostly first time actors, and they did an awesome job.  They were all hockey players at one time or another, and some were still playing, which added authenticity to the film, which is what director Gavin O'Connor was aiming for.  If you are a girl stuck watching this movie with your boyfriend and you don't want to watch it at first, trust me, you'll still like it!  The hockey players are amazingly hot!  I had a few favorites, but my favorite was Patrick O'Brien Demsey, who portrayed the team captain Mike Eruzione.  Not only was he a great actor, but he was hot! For those of you who have seen ""Bring it On"", the actor that plays male cheerleader Jan, Nathan West, is it this movie.  He plays Rob McClanahan, the second leading scorer on the team.

"You don't have to know or like ice hockey to appreciate ""Miracle"" - you'll relish the experience anyhow","I'm not a sports fan per se. ""Miracle"" is my first ice hockey experience and the film certainly made me enthused about it, appreciating the sport with much respect for what the players have to go through to reach where they are. Such talent, tenacity, creativity and team spirit, along with personal sacrifices, giving their all in pursuit of a dream - ""an unknown"" as Kurt Russell's Coach Herb Brooks put it - their commitment is admirable.This is a memorable film directed by Gavin O'Connor (""Tumbleweeds"" 1999). He optimizes every inch of the film:  the beginning credit roll employed a montage and deft use of typography giving us a setting of the times (almost felt like watching snippets of ""The Fog of War""). Quickly and right to the point, we see Kurt Russell's Coach Brooks telling the NHL decision makers that mindset and training tactics had to be changed in order to win against the leading Soviet hockey team. And for the next 2 hours and 10 mins, the theme is unswervingly demonstrated. The film is full of heart-tugging drama and exciting action (not explosives or chases) - it's the making of an ice hockey team transformed in front of our eyes, with suspenseful moments even though it's based on a true story, and it's definitely touching and uplifting. How can it not be - it culminates into the historical event of the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team playing opposite the 'undefeatable' Soviet team.Kurt Russell, a rather underrated actor, gave us an impressive performance in w-d Ron Shelton's ""Dark Blue"" 2003. Here, he's taken on the role of an intelligent, tough as nails ice hockey coach, Herb Brooks, in his story of choosing 26 young men for austere training and leading 20 of them representing the privileged (dream) team into 'battles' against the world's talented hockey teams in the 1980 Winter Olympics at Lake Placid, New York.The pace is tight, even at the closing credits roll, director O'Connor seized the chance to give us follow up info on how the team athletes are now doing. But there are wonderful pausing moments between Kurt Russell and the ever talented Patricia Clarkson (""Pieces of April"" 2003, ""High Art"" 1998) in a 'regular' role as Brooks' wife Patti - brief the scenes may be, she very much hold her own. (Don't miss her fascinating performance with Peter Dinklage and Bobby Cannavale as the interesting threesome in w-d Tom McCarthy's excellent debut film ""The Station Agent."") Noah Emmerich delivered a quiet performance as Craig Patrick, the assistant coach. (He was in the melodrama ""Beyond Borders"" 2003, along side Clive Owen and Angelina Jolie). Music by Mark Isham (""The Cooler"" 2003, IMAX film ""Galapagos: The Enchanted Voyage"" 1999, ""Point Break"" 1991) complemented the emotional build ups.This film reminds me of another worthy team building film based on true events, also distributed by Disney: director Boaz Yakin's ""Remember the Titans"" 2000, with Denzel Washington portraying Coach Boone leading a diverse high school team in unsettling times of the early 70's. Another stellar young energized cast with an equally brilliant performance from Will Patton as Coach Yoast. Experience it if you haven't.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Something to believe in ...,"Back in 1980 Herb Brooks led a group of young men on a dream for the Olympic Gold in Men's Hockey.  The Soviets were the ultimate team and considered the best in the world.  Many of these Soviets had played together for the past 15 years, while the Americans were young men who were coming together for the first time.  Brooks wasn't looking to put together a team of all the best players, but rather a team with the right players.  He wanted players that would play a game of attacks and take on the Soviet's game.  He knew the team he was to put together would be different than if he was going to be going for a National Championship.  He wanted this more than anything and was willing to do anything to accomplish that.I was just a child when the real events took place, but over the years from talking to family and seeing history recap on ESPN, I knew the story.  There were many things going on in the world at the time.  This wasn't just a game to the Americans watching, this was an escape.  This was a way to beat the Soviets.  This was a dream.  This was something to believe in.    It wasn't over with the Soviets, but that was such a tremendous accomplishment.  A bunch of young men beat the best team in the world, the same Soviet team that beat the NHL All-Star team not long before.This was a really good movie.  You don't have to be a sports fan to enjoy this.  It's not all sports.  We see the lives of the coach and the players. This is touching movie and a great one to watch with friends and family.

Can he whip a bunch of green, but talented kids into a competitive team?

All the kids playing the U.S. players are excellent, and the hockey footage is terrific. A feel-good movie.

Sports commentators of the time likened it to seeing a bunch of guys from Canada get together, form a football team and then beat the Pittsburgh Steelers.The producers of the movie deftly set up the context of the political unease between the Soviets and Americans and how America was desperate for some good news back in those days. There was an ongoing hostage crisis in Iran, an energy crisis and a collective crisis of identity for the entire nation.Another way ""Miracle"" excels is that it shows the human side of the whole preparation for the games and the drama that occurred. There are as many scenes with Herb Brooks and his wife as there are the coach and his players.Finally the hockey game between the Soviets and the Americans is beautifully staged and choreographed and makes the viewer forget he/she is watching a recreation of the event.

Disney does it again.,"Disney has now fallen into a new category.  They are now a movie company that can take a good movie or event and once again destroy it.  If you have ever had the opportunity to see the original movie about the 1980 team, `The Miracle on Ice,' you will find that the original showed more coach and player interaction.  The wonderful world or Disney decided to show a family being torn during the training of the team and then the family bonding. That is great, but they could have played off more on the players.  For example, Jim Craig.  He story was a great story to milk from (not going to tell you about it for you may not have seen it).  What about the relationship Mike Cruzione really had with Brooks?As for the decision to show the hockey games in action, they were not well done at all.  They did not show enough of the games where as a person who watched the Olympics that year saw the team mold more as a team as each period unfolded.  In the original they had shown actual clips of the actual games, and in my opinion brought back fond memories of the moment!Please don't let my opinion take away from what our players and coaches did back in 1979 and 1980.  They were a true miracle that this country needed. Even though I thought the movie was very lack luster, it is one that people should see to feel how important one event can help not only a few men, but a whole nation!  Thank you Herb Brooks and the other 20 players who made the team.  Thank you for not only winning the Gold medal, but thank you for helping this country!",3.0,Anonymous,History
Biggest Moment in American Sports History!,"Miracle is an inspirational sports film that touches on the what is mostly likely the best moment in American sports history. Thanks to a marvelous, powerful performance by Kurt Russell, the story goes from a clichéd mess to a very powerful, heartfelt story. This is your typical sports film with the main team as an underdog going against all odds to be number one. But unlike many sports film, this is actually a true story.Gavin O'Connor's film takes place during the Cold War and it spotlights on the 1980 Olympics. The film has the underdog, fresh-faced American hockey team versus the intimidating, experienced Soviet team. The film mostly talks about Herb Brooks and how he got his team into shape to face off against the Soviets.The acting is really good. Kurt Russell really adds new blood to the story and his role as Herb Brooks is most likely why this film is so moving. The other actors did solid too. Honestly, I see no reason why Patricia Clarkson should have been in this movie. All she does is play the role of the complaining wife. I liked how no-name people were cast as the players and they were really good.Overall, this is a truly inspirational sports film full of choking-up moments. I liked how they incorporated some history in the film so that the younger viewers would learn some important history. It's very predictable as it should be, because this was more than just a game. It's a symbol of American pride during these troubled times. This is how a sports movie should be made. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Great,"This is the best hockey movie of all time! Kurt Russell was amazing. All of the actors who were the players were great. This should of been nominated for an Oscar. Kurt Russell should have been nominated for an Oscar also! I love this movie! Top 5 sports movies(not in order) Hoosiers, Rudy, Miracle, The Babe, Field of Dreams. All of these movies are great but Miracle steps forward and send across more than sports. There are life lessons to be learned and also you can learn a lot about that time period. Watching Miracle is truly a lifting experience. Miracle stands above the rest by making a movies with such great action and with a sport that has only been measured in Hollywood by Slapshot and MVP.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Miracle,"This film is by far the Greatest Sports movie ever! it goes behind the helmets of team USA and shows you the men who wore them.Even though i was not alive in 1980 i have seen the actual ""miracle on ice"" archive footage,and i must say that this film is impeccably accurate.Gavin O'Connor has managed to make the audience feel like they went back in time and are witnessing the miracle all over again.I was extremely impressed to learn that the actors chosen to portray the 1980's U.S team were in fact hockey players first, who were taught to act.The action scenes in this film are intricate and will make you want to jump out of your seat cheering the U.S on even though you already know what's going to happen.I have based my own school film project off of Jack O'Callahan, one of the miracle players and this film was a great help. Even if you don't come away from this film with a passion to pick up a stick and lose some of your teeth, you can at least sleep better at nights knowing that there are no more long gas lines!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Proud to be an American,"This is one of those films that reminds people of the great things that Americans can accomplish.  If you have any ounce of patriotism at all, then this movie is highly recommended.  At the time that the actual event occured back in 1980, Americans were going through a very tough time. (The  Carter Years...thank God there was only four of them!)  This was just the thing that was needed to raise hope and morality.  Nobody who saw the actual event will ever forget it!Kurt Russel gives an excellent performance that should be recognized with an Oscar.  The supporting cast is good as well.

Of all the movies that have been made about the 1980 U.S. ice hockey team, this is surely the BEST. Kurt Russel plays the legendary Herb Brooks, the coach that brought a bunch of farmboys together to beat the best hockey team in the world. Through triumph and tragedy, these 20 young men pulled off the best game in the history of hockey. I have never seen something so purely spectacular in my life. Only God could create something better than Herb Brooks did in the winter of 1980. I give this movie a 10 out of 10.

fun movie,"not sure why others seem so critical of this fun movie. of course, if you are over 40years as i am, the recollection is vivid. nonetheless, there is always room to just recall, forget about the woes of our current lack of soviet opposition, and reminisce.acting is fine, supporting cast is even better. the story is so good, how can't you enjoy?personally, i covered this team when i was in college, and remember predicting that they'd win the gold medal. there was something that they had that transcended our mere human existence, and you could palpate it! there is nothing on screen that could possibly best that, and it is unreasonable to expect such. for those under 40years old, this might be a reasonable facsimile to the real thing since they could not possibly have that experience to have drawn upon.",,Anonymous,History
Almost a masterpiece,"I really, really like this movie. Except for the parts that, upon re-watching years later, are annoying or just inaccurate.First, the positive. The inspiration / miracle factor, comes through in spades. Kurt Russell is great as the mean yet human after all coach Herb Brooks. This movie depicts the formation of teamwork, real camaraderie, and overcoming early reactions to the Soviet team with visceral emotion and life. The opening narrative was one of the most powerful setting-establishers I have seen. The movie is nearly as inspiring as watching the game itself (which is perhaps the best sports match ever, Rocky eat your heart out). I really wanted to rate this a 10.I wish this movie would have stayed more consistent with how the story played out in real life. The story was incredible enough that events didn't need to be over dramatized, exaggerated or downright falsified. I can't go into details without revealing spoilers, but they are easy to find with minimal googling. I also wish this movie had more profanity. With the intensity of emotions that existed...I understand it is Disney, but Coach Herb is said to have used very strong language at times, and watering his tongue down did not help the storyline. Lastly, there was way too much stick-to-wall-thumping at the end, and not enough showing the hockey game. The first viewing I didn't notice, or mind, but upon re-watching, I asked myself, ""Were so many cut-scenes of the same kind of bench reaction really necessary?""This movie had a je ne sais quoi about it that really sets it apart from most of Hollywood. Miracle on Ice is probably one of America's proudest and most triumphant moments in her history. This movie really captures that feeling. I just think that with some better editing, less exaggeration of certain aspects (Jim Craig was great but not THAT amazing), and not watering down strong tongues who lashed out, this could have been a truly perfect 10 film.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Not only a good movie, but a good book too","""Do you believe in miracles? YES!"" declared Al Michaels on the night of February 22, 1980. A quote heard throughout North America at the end of a hockey game. A game in which a group of young, American men defeated the greatest hockey team in the world. This game not only changed the lives of these twenty men, but men and women across the nation. For many Americans, it was the first feeling of happiness, and relief, in years during a time of war.""The Boys of Winter: The Untold Story of a Coach, a Dream, and the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team"" shows the players lives before and during the Olympics, as well as Herb Brooks' aggressive coaching style. The book revisits the hockey game played on that cold, winter night in Lake Placid, New York. The author, Wayne Coffey, puts readers into the player's lives and helps them feel the pain and glory of it all. Coaches aren't always the player's friend. The main character, coach Herb Brooks, was a perfect fit for this team. He knew what it would take to win a gold metal. He pushed his players hard, sometimes to the point where the players would become sick, but this was all part of his plan. He wanted his players to be the best conditioned team at the games. He made his players believe they could win, even though the entire world deemed it impossible. That team, to have any chance at all, needed a maniac in charge, not a nice guy, and in Brooks it found an inspired one. His genius was to see that the American team needed to engage the Russians with their own style of play -- fast, fluid and based on puck control, not muscle -- and then to brainwash the American players, most of whom were former collegians with no international experience, into believing they were better than they were (McGrath).A hockey game couldn't have been drawn out any better. Coffey concentrated on the game against the soviets. He spreads it out over 11 chapters, while telling stories of the players in the midst of it. Some of the players were not easy to find for Coffey. A majority of them coming from Minnesota, where they had built homes in the mountains, or off of a lake. However, the players were generous enough to take interviews.Life isn't always easy. Coffey showed this well for one particular player. Mark Wells had an unusual life. He grew up in St. Claire Shores, Michigan and played for the Detroit Junior Red Wings in 1975. He was put on the fourth line for the Olympics, which he wasn't happy about, but almost didn't go at all. He suffered a hairline fracture in his ankle just weeks before the games. He worked hard to get back to playing speed, but wasn't a factor in the games. After the Olympics, Wells signed with the Montreal Canadians to play in the NHL, but was quickly traded to the Detroit Red Wings. Wells refused to go, saying his heart was with Montreal. He ended up playing minor hockey in 1981, but called it quits after. Unfortunately, his life started going downhill. In 1989, Wells was in the restaurant business and was unloading crates of turkeys. When he bent down to pick one of them up, he heard a snap and fell to the floor. He had cracked a vertebra in his lower back. He went through an eleven hour surgery to get it fixed; however, this meant he would no longer be able to work. He was nearly immobile, and had to move in with his mom. Nearly five years had passed since the accident when he met Tom Krozak. They spent most of their time together, having lunch and talking about life. At one point, having a friend in Krozak was the only thing that kept Wells alive. In 2001, he had another surgery to reduce the pain. The outcome was astonishing. He was able to walk without pain and live a normal life. Wells is currently finishing up school at Walsh College in Michigan. Coffey's description of the game was brilliant. Readers can feel the intensity and excitement. The body checks, the saves, and the goal celebrations were all vivid and colorful. Just under eight minutes remained. The U.S. defensemen were dropping to the ice at every chance to stop the puck from even getting to Craig. Ramsey met Kharlamov along the boards and flattened him, the Russian's red helmet slamming into the ice, maybe the hardest hit of the night. Fetisov teed up from the left point, but Morrow went down and smothered the shot. Alexander Golikov sped in on the left side and fired from the top of the left circle, way wide. Kasatonov launched another shot from the point, and Craig gloved it. Petrov came down, saw a lineup of four white shirts at the blue line, and cranked a slap shot from sixty-five feet. Craig kicked it away with his right skate (Coffey 237).The pictures that Coffey creates are exceptional. They really help the readers feel like they were at the arena that night. The Americans beating the Soviets is the greatest underdog story in sports history, and it may never be matched. ""The Boys of Winter"" shows the hardships, and the triumph of it all.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Great Movie!!!,"One of the greatest sports movies I have seen; right up there with Hoosiers. Thankfully, O'Connor stayed true to the story and did not put a ""Hollywood"" spin on it. Great to see actual hockey players in the movie who were turned into actors and not vice versa.

Watchers and Doers,"Spoilers herein.Rich American universities hire bunches of black kids to play basketball for them. Then if they do well, it somehow reinforces the schools' identity, even to the point of increasing in their mind the value of the education. I'm not kidding, if you don't know the US system.Similarly, if a few gymnasts go to the Olympics in the name of your country, they somehow reinforce your national identity when they win. That's because both the universities (excepting MIT) and the Olympic community have shamelessly exploited the assignment of self.This film is strictly formulaic, but expertly edited. The skating camera-work here is the star and gives a thrill. This is very much in the tradition of 'Red Shoes,' in how it blurs the line between the watcher and the dancer.That's the point of this. It plays off the political nature of the game. It begins with an effective collage of cold war related political images - not images of events so much but images that have become tokens in their own right. Prominent shots of the World Trade Center are included. The idea is clearly that if the US can beat the Rooskies, then any miracle of victory is possible.So we get the 'Mighty Ducks' story, except these kids get motivated by representing the US against their militaristic Soviet counterparts. You will get excited by the game, and likely feel dirty as a result of having been so jingoistically manipulated.Here's the thing that interests me: how the story is folded into the manner of its telling. Disney's method is to drill, drill, drill so that the competitive 'play' becomes natural. The idea is to not be particularly creative, like the 'All-Stars' are. Disney eschews stars, going for the team. A success reflects on the brand.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,History
Sentimental hogwash,"(2004) Miracle
DRAMAAs a person, who on occasion, watches and keeps up with hockey, basketball, football, baseball and soccer games, there's a reason why I try to stay 'clear' away from sports movies in general, and it is to avoid already expected clichés, since most sports films never offer anything new to what anyone can't find out themselves, if, let's say, if they wanted to get into the sporting field. I've never seen such ludicrousness, in a poor attempt, to turn a simple little game called hockey, as part of a solution to end the cold war- that'll be the day. The movie takes place sometime during the year of 1981, and Jimmy Carter was the President Of The United States, and the movie was implying that much of the other countries was hostile because of the Iranian hostage kidnapping of several Americans- via ""Argo"". Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell) has just been announced as the coach of the US hockey team, and the movie dwells on the heartbreaking choice he had to make, selecting only 20 best out of 27. I've never witnessed such cheap calls for sentimentalism, until I had saw this film. Viewers also get to witness how this affects their families and so forth. I mean, do I really need to say anymore. You know, the thing I want to say, is that part of the reason why Russia has won so many gold medals in the sport of hockey, is the fact that it's under Communism rule, making the point that much of the general Russian public are not in the best financial situation in comparison to, let's say the US, and that the entire environment itself had always been kinda icy cold- including Sweden and Canada for that matter- pointing out that, hockey is perhaps the only sports game those countries had ever played as long as they have the weather for it. For the US, it's going to have to be, and always will be American football- for hockey had never been a popular sport amongst Americans when they're others that are much more popular. For a movie that's more than 2 hours long, I've never seen such obviousness, such as when the players were jabbering about the good looking girls on the stand, when they should be focusing on the game. And then with all of those inspirational speeches and lectures we're always subjected to hear, everyone has to hear them no matter what sport you're in- it's all so ""routine"" that it gets way to tired after awhile. If I want to watch something like this, I'll either check out the documentaries, like ""Hoop Dreams"", or just tune on to my local sports channel, thank you very much. For, I don't need to see something that's made up and acted, when I can actually witness and see the actual thing.",3.0,Anonymous,History

The piece de resistance was the action sequences which put the viewer right there on the ice in the middle of all the plays. I think this was an incredible piece of movie making. As for the fans who commented on the ""mistake"" showing 4 periods on the score board, according the Olympic Hockey Rules, Once into the medal round at the Olympics, if a game is tied after three periods the teams play 10 minutes of overtime and, if still tied, the game is decided on a shootout. For the gold medal game, it is 20 minutes of OT before the shootout. Hence the ""4th period"", which in this case, was unnecessary.",,Anonymous,History

Great Sports Film with a Lot of Heart. Kurt Russle at His Best,"This is one of the best sports films ever made in my opinion. It tells the underdog story of the US Olympic team against the Russians in 1980. Anyone who was alive and awake at this time remembers what a stunning upset that was and for the fact that it was against our biggest Cold War adversary at that time. Even if you didn't follow sports or the Olympics, it was impossible not to hear about it.The film shows the realities of coaching a team. Not much coddling or favoritism going on here. Teams are a Team not a bunch of separate individual personalities which is part of the coaches main strategy: they must learn to work as a team and not a bunch of 'All Stars.'Patriotism is a strong point but not overwhelming. Coach says at one point, ""The name on the front on your jersey is way more important than the name on the back"" at a time when he was trying to emphasize that being a part of the USA Olympic Hockey Team was more important that any one player alone. Many Olympic athletes today should learn that lesson instead of acting like they are the most important humans on Earth and that the USA doesn't matter- even though the USA trained them and provided for them to compete at that level.The action is great and the actors can really skate. I recommend this film to anyone. This is one of the best Disney films to ever come out... before they started putting out so much PC garbage.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Miracle on Ice,"A marvelous movie that is more about the human spirit than simply a sports story. Herb Brooks is considered one of the greatest motivational coach's of all time. Herb was inducted into the National Hockey's Hall of Fame in 2006, which was overdue, however he earned the right and his family have the knowledge that his spirit will live on in the larger context of Hockey Legends. Kudos to Kurt Russell for his excellent acting in showing the essence of the man and keeping the force of Herb's genius in perspective. Gavin O'Connor's direction was superb in catching hockey at ice level where the action is most intense and capturing the competiveness of the young hero's who made hockey history relevant to all athletes no matter what the sport they participate in. On a personal note I just threw out a pair of plaid pants last year that were very similar to the outfit Kurt Russell/Herb Brooks wore and the memory of the late seventies and early eighties are still fresh as is the memory of the actual event that was celebrated in Canada as much as it was in the United States.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Love it, it is extremely funny and has a lot of heart too","MIRACLE, the Disney retelling of the U.S. Hockey squad's astonishing Gold Medal performance at Lake Placid in 1980, is not a great film (a TV-movie from 1981, ""Miracle on Ice"", despite the bizarre casting of 69-year old Karl Malden as 43-year old coach Herb Brooks, is superior, although relying heavily on TV footage for game sequences), but it does offer Kurt Russell in one of the finest performances of his long career.The 53-year old Russell, a life-long veteran of both TV and film (making his debut on a ""Sugarfoot"" TV episode, at age 6), has developed a reputation over the past two decades as a very competent, if not overpowering leading man, primarily in action films (ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, TOMBSTONE, BREAKDOWN) and comedies (USED CARS, CAPTAIN RON, OVERBOARD). What is often forgotten, however, is that he has remarkable 'range' as an actor, with brilliant performances in the TV-movie ""Elvis"" (1979), the underrated SWING SHIFT (1984, where he met his long-time love, Goldie Hawn), and 2003's DARK BLUE (as a crooked cop searching for redemption during the bloody aftermath of the Rodney King riots in L.A.). As age has carved his features, Russell has lost the ""beach boy"" glamor that had often 'stereotyped' him in the past, and gives his 'Herb Brooks' a sense of credibility and pain that lifts his performance to Academy Award caliber.Herb Brooks was a remarkable person, long before Lake Placid. Despite success in coaching a string of national champion college hockey teams, he had never recovered from being the last player 'cut' from the 1960 Gold Medal U.S. hockey squad, and from being a member of the '64 and '68 teams that were humiliated by the Soviets. Driven by a desire to beat the nearly invincible Russian squad, he realized that a group of college 'all-stars' would never possess the 'team' skills to get the job done. Ruthlessly, refusing the assistance of the U.S. Olympic Hockey Committee, he pieced together a squad of talented skaters, 'broke' them, then re molded them to fit his vision, working them unmercifully for over six months, while spouting Vince Lombardi-like platitudes. Despite his torturous regimen, just days before the Olympics, his team would be humiliated by the Soviets, 10-3, and no one gave his squad a chance for a medal.hill the film suffers from a lack of depth in the portrayal of the players (by the way, they do all their own skating; TV footage is not used), MIRACLE's 'feel' of the decade is well-done, using montages and voice-overs to convey the American sense of helplessness in a decade of tragedies. The unexpected U.S. victory galvanized the nation (Al Michaels' stunned reaction, ""Do you believe in Miracles?"", has become a catch phrase for both the game, and the times), and actually contributed to turning the country around.While the Academy Awards will probably ignore Kurt Russell's commanding performance (as the film was not a 'hit'), MIRACLE is still a film worth viewing, given our own troubled times. While the film may not be 'great', it's message of hope is certainly worthwhile!",8.0,Anonymous,History

It's on par with the best Tom Hanks and Jack Nicholson has ever offered.The action sequences are amongst the best ever filmed in a sports movie so for hockey fans you will have to wait until the 2nd half for your thrills.I am not a devoted hockey fan but I found this movie so entertaining I plan to see it again.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Gavin O'Connor did wonderfully.,"Wow. This movie is definitely everything I expected it to be. The people who are portraying the actual players did a wonderful job, the director, Gavin O'Connor was the one that really shocked me though. He made sure that every move was the same exact one as it was in the real games. I was very impressed. It was also in the correct places at the right times, where the events actually happened. And the actors were wonderful at acting and playing hockey, a thing which is hard to do. Accents and physical appearances were great, too. Every player, from Mike Eruzione (Patrick O' Brien Demsey) to Phil Verchota (Kris Wilson) resembled the real people as well as how they played ice hockey. Gavin wanted this movie to mean something, and it has to a lot of people. Good job, Gavin!",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Even though I knew the outcome, I still welled up at the end. An excellent movie!","Kurt Russell has to be one of the most under-appreciated actors working today. For this part, he BECAME Herb Brooks. As for the movie, it's well-made, well-acted and extremely moving, even though you know the ending.Al Michaels' call still gives me chills every time I hear it. Seen in the context of the movie, which showed the mountain Brooks and team had to climb, it was even more powerful. One thing the director did well was the opening montage which focused on the time during which the 1980 Olympics occurred. This was post-Watergate America, suffering from Jimmy Carter's malaise. Against that backdrop, the tonic the US victory provided can be better understood for those too young to have lived through it.This is a movie to own and re-watch every so often. The DVD comes with additional footage of an ESPN interview with the real players. That's worth watching, too. This ranks up there with Field of Dreams as one of the best sports movies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,History
`Miracle' is what American filmmakers do best.,"`Seabiscuit' on ice?  `Miracle' is what American filmmakers do best: a rousing true tale of an underdog overcoming insurmountable odds to win the prize. Director Gavin O'Connor's dramatization of the 1980 USA Winter Olympic team's victory over Russia's juggernaut champions for 15 years is even more exuberant than the horse race because the team represented the renewal of American spirit in times gloomy in the recounting. `Mighty Ducks' this is not.`Seabiscuit's' depression era salvaging spirit seems a bit tame next to Iranian hostage takers, empty gas pumps, post Watergate, and Viet Nam, a few of the dark events that left President Jimmy Carter few options other than to scold the American people for indolence and apathy.  The opening titles' montage of period footage is the best I have seen to establish an era whose hopes and fears were crystallized in this new team of very young players. Make no mistake about it; the film's focus is the US victory over the USSR, so much so that the final victory for the Olympic gold over Finland is but a footnote.USA veteran hockey coach Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell) knows it's not just a game, as his enduring wife (Patricia Clarkson) reminds him in the hours when he is most absorbed in game films and firings and neglecting his family.  In fact, `Miracle' is about this remarkable coach's vision that only the most grueling practice will prepare them for the best team in the world. He purposely at one point verbally beats them up, walks out of the room, and says to his assistant coach Craig Patrick (Noah Emmerich), `That ought to wake them up.' His assistant coach, team doctor, and board overseers do not agree with his aloof tactics but are mute at the final victory when the announcer remarks about the team's stunning stamina.The Americans' average age was 21; some of the USSR's players had been on the ice together for 15 years.  Intimidation was the key Russian strategy (as well as some of the best players in the world).  This grim group probably couldn't remember when it was last defeated (early 60's?).  But the Americans prevailed in a victory the director makes immediate and visceral with Steadicam, close up, and swelling music.The film lacks the ability to tell exactly why the USA won, besides the painful preparation, because the Russians remain faceless, only the coach briefly featured as a lean Brezhnev with beetle eye brows and nary a smile from him or his team. At a point in the game when the Americans surge ahead, Brooks remarks that the coach didn't know what to do.  Darrell Royal, commenting on football coaches, gives an insight into Herb Brooks' success: `A head coach is guided by this main objective: dig, claw, wheedle, coax that fanatical effort out of players.'Wish we knew more about that elusive success, but this we do know: Herb Brooks was responsible for putting together the finest group of young hockey players in American history, training them to the point of retching and fainting, suffering from a lack of faith around him, and delivering gold worth more to a nation than all the jewels of a monarchy.",,Anonymous,History
"Shallow, disappointing film adaptation of one of sport's greatest stories","When I first saw the trailer for Disney's ""Miracle"" last summer, I told myself I'd go and see that film on opening weekend. It is unquestionably a film that deserved to be made. Perhaps, though, it deserved to be made by someone else.Like Disney's last true story, feel-good sports outing, 2002's ""The Rookie,"" ""Miracle"" never quite captures the emotion and inspiration it should, given that the story behind the production is a tremendous one in both instances.Though his performance is praised by those who knew Herb Brooks, the great coach that led this team to their improbable triumph, Kurt Russell struggles as the lead with an underwritten character. That's a theme that would become recurring, almost monotonous, for everyone else. Disney does not give the ""characters"" (I hesitate to call them as such, since they are real people) any room to breathe, and the story falters greatly at various points. It has a stop-and-go feeling to it, where things apparently just magically happen without the viewer being given the privilege of actually seeing them unfold. At one point, these guys aren't getting along so well. Then, they're starting to play together. And before you know it, we've apparently witnessed the birth of a hockey family after an outsider is brought into the fold.The only true focus any of the players get goes to Mike Eruzione (Patrick O'Brien Demsey) and goalie Jim Craig (Eddie Cahill), and it is largely undeveloped and unrealized. Both young men were remarkable and inspirational stories in their own right, but neither can seem to really open up in this film. Eruzione goes from nearly being cut to being the captain, with little-to-no visible reason for it. Craig pops up every twenty minutes or so to have an issue with something, reminding us that this guy has some issues he needs to get through. That's really about as far as we ever get into these young men, besides some feats of toughness from Jack O'Callahan (Michael Mantenuto) and Rob McClanahan (Nathan West).Overall, ""Miracle"" falls disappointingly short of the glory that the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team brought to a sport and, truly, an entire nation. It's hard to care about the players, as you never truly get to know any of them, or even get to know the team itself. We never get to see Herb Brooks really teaching them the new style of hockey the players adapted to succeed against the Russians and the rest of the world's top teams, and we never get to see exactly when this ragtag bunch of kids really becomes a bona fide team. While we know those things truly happened, and that makes it easy to fill in the blanks, ""Miracle,"" standing alone, does not satisfy.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Best Coaching Movie Ever Made,"I caught this movie on TV last week, having missed it in theaters a few years ago - not being very interested in 'hockey' movies. As I started to watch it, I could tell within 10 minutes that it was going to be terrific, mostly due to the excellent performance of Kurt Russell. Why he was not nominated for an Oscar is beyond me, because his character is the Hannibal Lecter of sports coaches. The whole movie is really about coaching and team building, perhaps the best example since ""12 O'Clock High"", and doesn't bore the non-hockey enthusiast with endless games, much like ""Rocky"" and boxing, instead focusing on character. Being Canadian (where the movie was filmed, by the way), I was also happy not to have over-the-top patriotic rhetoric. Though there are 'goofs' on historical accuracy, it is always enjoyable to see a period of history replayed.

Outstanding,"As a life-long hockey player, I felt this film was long overdue. It was well done, and the acting was outstanding, especially Kurt Russell (who deserves an Oscar nomination), and all of the hockey players.The choreography was incredible considering how tough it is to recreate hockey. It is too bad many of the shots used in the movie are impossible in real hockey games.I do wish I new how much was genuine and how much was dramatized to fit 6 months into 2 hours.

Ice Rinks of Dreams.,"Pure popcorn film that uses a proven formula to get its cliches and story across. Admittedly though the formula here is good enough to make ""Miracle"" a minor success. New U.S. Olympic ice hockey coach Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell) takes a band of rag-tag young men from various places and try to mold them together to defeat the dead-eyed Soviet Union national team which had captured gold medals at each winter game competition from 1964 through 1976 (every four years of that period). The U.S. Olympic Committee just wants to be competitive, but Russell goes beyond that philosophy---he wants to win it all. And thus we have a ""Hoosiers""/""Remember the Titans"" hybrid with a splash of ""Rocky"" and ""Chariots of Fire"" mixed in. The result is a good, but far from great little film that could best be described as ""The Rookie""'s and ""Field of Dreams""' (two films that are very over-rated in my mind) little brother. Russell is the only notable performer here. Patricia Clarkson is the closest thing to being the second fiddle as Russell's wife. The hockey players are all flat characters that end up being Midwestern and Northeastern stereotypes. The Russians are more mysterious than interesting and those in the Olympic Committee are just present in the venture. Russell's domineering command of the screen and a very memorable musical score make up for most of the picture's shortcomings. Runs a bit long, but still a good way to spend some time with friends and family and remember a truly amazing part of American and sports history. Sadly the real Herb Brooks died in an automobile accident during the early stages of this production's filming. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,History
Not the best /:,"The fact that this is a disney movie, you would expect it to be more kiddish. Don't let that throw you off. In my opinion this more of an adult like movie rather than it is a kid one. Only because it's not cartoonized and sportsy, total opposite from other more popular disney movies. The entire plot of the movie is to tell the true story of Herb Brooks a player-turned-coach. He led the 1980´s US olympic team to victory and beat a what seemed to be an invincible Russian squad. It was really, truly, inspiring to watch. This movie did not go into the history as much as I would preferred it to. The little bit of history in this movie is interesting, I just wish they would´ve put more into it. Gavin O´Connor was the director of this movie. He's directed about 16 other movies, Miracle is the only one of them that i've watched so far. The acting in the movie was great, i'm not even gonna lie. The only ´main actor´ that i´ve seen in other movies is Kurt Russell. He's been a part of so many other movies. His acting is really great especially in other movies, or at least I think so.

Miracle,"Perhaps Al Michaels said it best, while opening the broadcast for the Soviet and USA 1980 Olympic hockey game, ""For people who don't know the difference between a blue line and a clothesline, its irrelevant."" The movie Miracle is about much more than just a hockey team and its journey to the Olympic games. This is a true story of an inspirational team of twenty college kids who competed in the 1980 Olympics. The coach who brought these guys together and made them a family in such a short amount of time was Herb Brooks. He some how got the team to buy in and believe that they could stand a chance with the immortal Soviet Union at the time. This movie portrays much more than just an underdog sports story. It reveals the difficult times Americans were faced to go through and all the horrifying things that were happening with them during the cold war with Russia. Herb Brooks and his team gave Americans an opportunity to take their mind off the distractions and unite as one to watch the greatest sports moment in history. Miracle is a different underdog story in the fact that during the movie they don't focus on the other team much at all. Along with that is you don't know many of the guys on the USA team. The name of the characters and the small talk scene between the guys is just about all you get for depth of the characters. This movie is about the United States proving that Democracy is superior through a hockey game and understanding the man, Herb Brooks, who played a vital part in it. Herb Brooks, played by Kurt Russell, is the main focus in the film from a character standpoint. Kurt Russell does an amazing job portraying the type of man that Herb was. Kurt was able to provide such insight to Herbs life during the movie because Herb was actually on set to help him get into character. Herb was cut from the 1960 Olympic hockey team a week before the team won the gold medal and he was going to do anything in his power to insure they won it in 1980. He showed this through out the movie by not letting his emotions get in the way. The camera work in this movie is unreal. When you watch the movie it feels like you are out their on the ice with the players. The action scenes flow really well together and are easy to follow what is going on even if you have no background in hockey. The amount of work it must of taken to get each scene perfect is insane. An interesting aspect about Miracle is that when people watch the movie it gives them an indescribable feeling. It is a story that most Americans of 35 years or older are able to recall when and where they were during the time the event happened. I was talking with my teacher one day and asked him about the movie. He said he remembers the exact place he was at and what he was doing when the game was played. Watching the movie brought him back to that moment and it gives him chills every time he watches it. It gives me chills and I didn't even live through it, but it feels like you are when watching the movie. Disney pictures went above and beyond to recreate the greatest moment in sports history and it will leave you grinning from ear to ear.",10.0,Anonymous,History
One of My All-Time Favorite Sports Movies,"I remember the 1980 US Hockey Team's victory over the Soviet Team like it was yesterday. It's just one of those things that if you were fortunate enough to see, you'll never forget. The 80's were one of the worst economic times for this country I can ever remember (I was 14 at the time) and this was indeed about a lot more than just hockey. It became what was indeed the GREATEST moment in sports that I will ever see. To re-live this moment through the film ""MIRACLE"" is a real treat. I know where the story is going to go.

Casting Hockey Players,"One of the things that make Miracle such a thrilling sports film is the realistic action scenes depicting the ice hockey competitions of the United States Olympic team. Past sports films relied on the use of stunt doubles or professional athletes to perform athletic scenes in place of the main cast. However in filming Miracle, there was clearly no need for stunt doubles as the actors themselves were able to perform the on-ice actions required. This is due to the fact that the actors cast to play the roles of the hockey players in the film were selected primarily based on their ice skating ability rather than particular acting ability. I believe that this casting decision was a tremendous benefit to the quality of the film.As a very fast paced and high intensity game, a hockey film demands an enormous effort to efficiently capture the nuances of the gameplay during filming. While other sports such as football and baseball can be plausibly acted out by professionals in place of the actors because of the stop and start nature of gameplay, hockey must be filmed in a continuous way. Therefore, it is very difficult for actors and stunt doubles to be switched in and out during action scenes while still having the game appear realistic. To solve this problem, the director was faced with two options. He could either cast professional actors and teach them how to play hockey, or he could cast hockey players and teach them how to act. The director, Gavin O'Connor, chose to cast former college and minor league ice hockey players to play the roles of the American and the foreign hockey players in the film.In this case, I believe that casting former hockey players was the right decision and caused the films realism to be enhanced far and above what it would have been if regular actors were forced to learn a game that takes years to master. The cast as a whole had minimal acting experience, but still performed admirably well. The acting was not perfect, but the benefits of the realistic hockey scenes more than make up for any deficit in the theatrical ability of the cast. I can only imagine how deplorable the hockey action scenes would have been if actors who could barely skate were portraying the elite hockey players.In addition to the on-ice ability of the cast, the hockey players cast in the film are nearly perfect in their portrayal of the hockey sub-culture that exists at all levels of competition. With their long hair, foul language, and stoic determination, each and every member of Team USA is a token collegiate hockey player. Obviously, this stems from the fact that they most of the actors were at some point collegiate hockey players.In particular, Mike Mantenuto, who portrays defenseman Jack O'Callahan puts on an incredible performance. His shoulder length hair is a perfect imitation of what a hockey player hopes to achieve. Also, he puts on a very believable show of the grudge his character holds against another player, and the violent way in which the rivalry culminates. Finally, Mantenutos performance during the scene in which he is injured is a perfect enactment of how a hockey player would react to a potentially career ending injury. His face appeared to be emotionless, but his eyes revealed a deep heartbreak that only comes when a player is faced with the end of his career.In conclusion, the right decision was made when it came to casting the members of the United States Olympic hockey team. The hockey players-turned-actors were phenomenal in their portrayal of their real life counterparts. All culminating in what is clearly one of the greatest sports films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A hockey game to always remember,"Kurt Russell stars as coach Herb Brooks in a true story of the 1980 U.S. Olympic ice hockey team winning the gold medal by defeating the powerful Soviet Union and Finland teams at Lake Placid.  Brooks has had a dream of coaching the U.S. Olympic team ever since he was cut from the 1960 U.S. Olympic team.  Brooks' dream comes true, and he gets the coaching job in 1979.  Brooks puts together a team of college kids and begins to get them into shape.  Since the Soviet Union is the greatest hockey team in the world, Brooks begins to retrain his team in the European style of playing the game.  The Soviet Union team has won four consecutive gold medals and recently defeated a team of National Hockey League all-stars.  Brooks said that the all-stars were individual players and not a team.  With all his hard training, he finally turns these kids into the U.S. Olympic team, and a family. The team defeats the Soviet Union in the semifinal round by not allowing them a single goal for the last 10 minutes of the game.  With the world watching the game on TV, Al Michaels asks his famous question at the end of the game, `Do you believe in miracles? Yes!'  The team still had to play Finland in the final round, which they won.  I am one of those people who saw this game, and it brought back our pride in the USA during the cold war.

Miracle: A Student Review,"The movie Miracle is much more than your typical American patriotism movie. With the stellar acting, and spirited directing, Miracle extends beyond the reach of inspirational films and into the realm of pure excellence. After watching the film, one is left with a feeling of great patriotism nationalism and belief in one's country.Kurt Russell delivers the performance of his lifetime as he portrays Herb Brooks, a hard-nosed, passionate United States national hockey coach. Russell captures the character of Herb Brooks and develops his own passion as an actor. The active pacing back and forth and fast-paced and overdramatic gum-chewing helps Russell in fully becoming the head coach of the United States hockey team. One of Russell's most memorable scenes in the film is when he delivers a speech to the team when they are experiencing some adversity. Russell displays true acting brilliance as he is able to fully grasp the fierceness and desire for greatness that Brooks displayed when actually giving the speech. Even the casual viewer will feel the effect of this speech and feel that same desire for greatness in their own life. The constant action and dramatic moments of the movie will keep anyone on the edge of their seat and begging for more.Complementing the impeccable acting by Kurt Russell and others is the determined directing of Gavin O'Connor. Mr. O'Connor makes it much more than just a sports film about an average hockey team that rises to glory. He uses the historical events of the time to show how Americans can rally behind a cause, even when times are tough. The way that O'Connor is able to portray the struggles of a young team on their Olympic journey depicts perfectly the way Americans were struggling as a country to combine as one in their Cold War pursuits against the Soviet Union. O'Connor incorporates real-life events all throughout the film. This includes the way that the film begins with a brief historical year by year review and news clips with current events of the time scattered in. The current events that are displayed in the film really help to make the viewer feel that the film is more realistic and are instrumental in conveying the common themes of patriotism and extreme nationalism.Contributing to the overall greatness of the film is the dramatic scenes involving the trials and tribulations of representing one's country on the world's grandest stage. One scene in particular that I will choose to focus on is the semifinal game against the Soviet Union. The United States had been embarrassed by this team in the past as the Soviet Union were in a class all to themselves. Being a young, inexperienced team, the US was a major underdog in this matchup. After coming together as one, UNITED team, will the Americans be able to match the Soviets in strength and speed and beat the greatest team ever assembled? My all-time favorite part of the movie is when Al Michaels coined his famous phrase, ""5 seconds left in the game, do you believe in miracles?! YES!"" As an avid wrestler, I often used mental preparation as a big part of my success. Before every big match that I ever had, and I mean EVERY big match, I would watch Miracle in its entirety. The feeling of great inspiration and drive for success that I got after watching this film made me feel as if I could accomplish anything I put my mind to, a feeling that is exactly what Gavin O'Connor does such a remarkable job conveying.

Addressing some of the other comments,"Some people commenting on this movie are admittedly not hockey fans, and some are not good with their history, so I am going to offer some needed insight: 1. to the guy who commented that Noah Emmerich did a poor acting job, not showing enough emotion: This is actually a fairly representative portrayal of assistant coach Craig Patrick. Hockey coaches are often more level-headed than you might expect, and Patrick was no exception. Emmerich played him pretty darn well, actually.2. Someone asked why Kurt Russell played Brooks with a polish accent. That's not a polish accent, it's a Minnesota accent - which sounds similar, especially given the number of Polish immigrants living in the upper Midwest. If you watched Fargo, you would hear a similar accent by many of those characters.3. To the guy who said this: ""The only part of the film that was totally unnecessary was the typical Liberal slant that Hollywood just has to put in our faces every chance it gets. Here, they do it by quick cheap shots against Republican Presidents while airing an inspirational speech by Democrat Jimmy Carter."" You, my friend, are clearly no student of history. Carter's speech was considered by many then - and now - to be a disaster. Instead of having its intended effect, it instead resulted only in causing Carter's already-low favorability rating to plummet further. And it is indeed in context; the ""Malaise"" speech, as it became known, fits in with the other historical elements shown at the start of the movie.4. Finally, a lot of non-hockey people complained about the lack of emotion in the characters and the acting. You would be very disappointed to find that hockey players are not over-the-top drama queens, I'm sorry to tell you. We get emotional for two things: scoring goals and winning games. At those points the movie portrayed the emotions, no? Otherwise you're not going to get a lot of drama, and the movie showed that accurately.

The performance of a lifetime,"The sports movie Miracle, about how the American Olympic hockey team won the gold at Lake Placid in 1980, defying all the odds and beating out the Soviet Union and Finland, is unabashedly a vehicle for a star, Kurt Russell as coach Herb Brooks. Miracle never escapes from certain essential conventions of the genre it represents. One by one team members emerge from the crowd for little moments in the spotlight, then fade back into the team. The coach has to struggle with his wife because as a husband and father he's barely present for the year of the Olympics. Cohorts and rivals challenge his methods. Then the big game comes at the end to rouse the audience and resolve everything exactly as we knew it would.It's the last big screaming jingoistic Cold War victory, but then again it isn't: it's not about politics. It's about the game, the coach says, and since he sets the tone throughout, we buy that. What gives you the shivers and raises the blood pressure isn't jingoism but that old crowd pleaser, seeing an underdog come from way behind to win. And it's true this time: the story really happened, more or less anyway. And we get to see some real hockey players play hockey too.Miracle is a star vehicle all right, because the focus is on the coach and his methods more than it is on the team. But Kurt Russell saves the movie and redefines the vehicle because he's self effacing without ever ceasing to dominate the story. Russell controls Herb's gruff manner with more subtlety than Gene Hackman or Denzel Washington - two actors who've done this kind of role so often they could do it in their sleep - would be likely to manage. They've done it too many times. They've started to yell. They've lost the feeling.Russell succeeds in making his character's toughness subservient to his goals as a coach. He's aloof, hard, even mean, with the players as they meet and work out and the eliminations take their toll. His assistant coach, Craig Patrick (Noah Emmerich), gets to be the good guy -- and he does so winningly. But Herb Brooks's distance, hardness and meanness are clearly part of a strategic professional plan. At the end he comments years later that now pros play in the Olympic team sports and we have `dream teams,' but all that means is that the games we dream of never happen any more. He's not looking for a combination of the best amateur hockey players: he's looking for the players who'll play best together, not for a dream team but for the best team he can coach to victory at Lake Placid, beating all the odds. The best talent, the hungriest guys, the players with the biggest need to prove themselves and win.Real hockey players play the team members. They're not just athletic actors who look good with their shirts off: they're guys who're really fast on the ice, and they're out there doing their own skating. The director shines here because except for one ensemble scene early on, there's no awkwardness in the acting of these young men. They come through as authentically as if they were all professional actors. Their presence gives all the dressing room and game sequences a sense of reality they'd never otherwise have. Hardly any of the players stand out, and that's good. There aren't any scene-stealers. It's a team. It's about the game: and here, the movie becomes less conventional and avoids clichés about oddball characters who overcome a laundry list of personal obstacles to become good players.Herb galvanizes the men by making them angry at him, then a `family,' as one says after they've suffered together enough to want to stay together; and then they believe in their coach because they see his intensity. He's not trying to be liked; his eye is on the prize. He cares about what they care about and that makes him one with them. And so when we see that his family life suffers, it's clearly not a dysfunctionality but a necessary part of the whole strategy, a price to pay for being as focused as he has to be. Patricia Clarkson as Mrs. Brooks, dolled up in this non-indy role, is fresh and without sentimentality. Her indy quirkiness, toned down an octave, makes her seem authentic, not just window dressing.Despite avoiding conventional tricks, Miracle never ceases to be a sports movie with a conventional trajectory. But nothing is too crudely telegraphed, even as the scenes are brightly hued. Take Herb's elimination of the twenty-first man, for instance: the time when he calls his last cut in to tell him. This is a guy who's `done everything I've told him to do.'`There's no easy way to do this.' This is an emphatic, intense little scene, but there's nothing corny about it. Russell's forceful restraint works in scene after scene after scene.Many times, as when a star player gets a serious knee injury, the writing underlines Russell's understatement. The coach just doesn't say much. He avoids telling the player what we've just heard the doctor say, that the kid will be out for four games. Herb just says he has to get the knee photographed and then see. He's merely present; there's no speechifying.We don't see a lot of hockey before the final few games. During the early workouts and eliminations we see Herb make the team members do the same fast turning and skating exercise over and over to the point of exhaustion. No team has ever been able to outskate the Soviets, he says. They've got to be able to do that to win. The point is borne out in the key game when the Americans do indeed beat the Soviets by outskating them. They've also got an absolutely brilliant goalie, Jim Craig (Eddie Cahill), the one man who's shown his individuality by refusing to take a psychological test. The final couple of games leading to victory are covered almost play by play. This too contributes to a sense of authenticity. There's too much crosscutting to the coaches and fan reaction shots at the end for my taste, but this is a movie about a coach and a victory, not just about a hockey game. As the games develop, you realize that Brooks truly picked the talent he needed to win the gold.The movie particularly shines at that inevitable clichéd moment, the final pep talk before the key victory. To begin with, Russell has good material to work with: the speech he delivers is extremely well written. `Great moments come from great opportunities.' he begins. There's not a word out of place. It's eloquent, yet Russell's strong, unflashy delivery strips it of any sense of patness or rhetoric. It's the kind of speech you could memorize, a Gettysburg address of pre-game pep talks. And its creative logic is brilliant: `If they played us ten games, they might win nine. But they have only one game, and we're going to win it.'Yes!In its simple way, Miracle is a well-made movie. Kurt Russell's extraordinarily impressive, self-effacing acting in the lead role is more than well done: it's the performance of a lifetime. And because of Russell's restraint his costars shine like winners, every one.",,Anonymous,History
Thrilling Bit Of Nostalgia,"I can still remember the 1980 Olympics and that fateful hockey game with the Russians - the first time I had watched a hockey game from beginning to end. The film provided a thrilling bit of nostalgia. Kurt Russell did a spectacular job as Herb Brooks. The director also managed to maintain the differences among all of the players so that we could identify them on the screen (with large casts, characters tend to blend together). The only knock I have (besides the obvious factual manipulations and the rah-rah U.S stuff) was that there wasn't enough individual drama, only a taste of it with Brooks and Jim Craig. But that is a small point indeed. This was a very good film.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"A film that captures a team, a brotherhood and a country","If you live in America, you've heard of the 1980 United States olympic hockey team. They defyed the odds and won the gold medal in Lake Placid, NY. Some saw it happen, but only the people involved knew the true story. Now we all get to know.The movie follows Herb Brooks(Kurt Russell)from his meeting with the american hockey association to become the coach, to the infamous soviet victory. When tryout day comes around, Brooks has already done his homework and knew what kind of kids he wanted on his squad. Brooks cuts most of them on the first day, even though they had 6 more days of tryouts.Many of the kids on the team had a rivalry. Jack O'Callahan was cheap shoted by Rob McLanahan in college which he says cost him his college championship. Brooks quickly gets the boys to forget about they're grudges and start playing together, by hours and hours of hard practice.When the boys did'nt play up to the potential Brooks felt they could the were forced to sprints, which they did all night after a tie with the Norwegian team.The boys practicing and playing together everyday for months on end forced them to become a true team. Even more than a team. A brotherhood. A family.The hard practices and feelings of brotherhood toward one another finally come through in the infamous game against the Soviet Union, which united America together. (I have seen the olympic game against the soviets and they TRULY played like a team). A couple days later the downed Finland to win it all and put a cap on the olympics.It was all over.It was a Miracle.The acting in this movie is superb.Thumbs up to Kurt Russel for his Research in this role. He had many of the same mannerisims as Herb and with his accent actually sounded just like him. If I didn't know that it was Kurt Russell on the screen, I would have believed it was actually Herb Brooks.The boys in the roles of the players also did a very good job. However i felt that many of the actors didn't look too much like the actual players,(such as Mark Pavelich and Ken Morrow to name a few)but hey, in movies you can't always have exact look alikes, right.The long and short of it, Miracle is a terrific film and is definately up there with Slap Shot as my favorite sports film ever.A definate 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,History
You WILL believe in Miracles!,"Another one of the great inspirational sports movies, one that concerns one man, Herb Brooks, who has to coach a ragtag group of dedicated hockey players to represent the USA at the 1980 Olympics, and win a long overdue medal for the country in hockey after a string of victories from the giant USSR. Of course there's always struggles from finding support to quelling old rivalries between players to motivating them to play their best. Kurt Russell is terrific as Herb, this is strictly about the man more than the team, so don't expect the shenanigans of Mighty Ducks, nor the formulaic plot that one has, this is a true story of a team fighting to win the gold. The question is, can they do it? Herb will have to give them all the instruction they'll need to get it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Exciting,"Wow!  A good action sports movie.  Nice camera work during the practices and games.  Watched that game in 1980 and remember Al Michael's ""Do you believe in miracles? YES!!""  Along with the scene of Jim Craig searching out his father after the game with the flag draped on his shoulder.Despite knowing the outcome of the game, this movie still grabbed me and drew me into it as if I did not know what happened (reminiscent of ""Apollo 13"").  Nice to see the movie show how hard team USA had to work and practice and how Herb Brooks chose the players to represent the U.S. in the Olympics.The supporting cast also was quite good with their performances, collectively might be worth a mention as best supporting actors when next years awards season comes around.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Lake Placid a place like Bern ?,"Watching the Miracle, it is (for a German viewer at least) not easy to resist a comparison with the just released ""Wunder von Bern"" (Miracle of Bern) movie linked to the German Soccer Worldcup Win 1954 against the 4 year long undefeated Hungarians. The parallels are easy to draw : Here are the Americans still depressed from the Vietnam drama and suffering additional hits thru recession and hostage taking at their Iranian Embassy (events which are back grounded in the movie), but who rise against and regain their pride thru some All American boys bringing down the unsurmountable Russians (USSR people to be correct at that time)on the ice in Lake Placid to righten the set-up between the 2 world powers. Here are the German Underdogs just 9 years after World War 2 revitalizing a whole Nation and putting them on track for the ""Wirtschaftswunder"" (Economic Miracle) that put Germany into the leading group of industrialized Nations. Here is Herb Brooks, the no-nonsense Coaching Guru, there is Sepp (Josef) Herberger, who made a living from one liners like ""The ball is round"" and ""The Game lasts 90 Minutes"". But this is also where the difference is : While the Miracle is carried almost only on the shoulders of Kurt Russell as the charismatic coach molding average College Boys into Winners, the main story of the German movie is the reunification of a Father, who is a late returner (9 years after war ended) from Russian prison camp, with his family (Mother, daughter, grown up boy sympathizing with Eastern Socialism and a younger boy he has never seen before. He lost his place as head of the family, as they had to get along without him for 10 years or more and is facing major trouble to find his place in the new Germany. Only in a long and painful process he can fit into his role, culminating in a trip with his younger Boy to the final in Bern, Switzerland, where the boys hero (and preferred father figure as to then) scores the winning goal upon his appearance. This makes the story a lot more heart warming and connected to life compared to the however great impersonation Kurt Russel does. Where the miracle is however stronger, is to show, what are the fundamentals of such miracles : After a lackadaisical test game he lets his boys do the drill (sprinting up and down from goal- to middle line) even when the janitor cuts of the power and the light. He continues until the lights of his boys go out literally....",,Anonymous,History
Best hockey movie?!,"There aren't many movies about ice hockey. The ones I've seen are: The Mighty Ducks, Young Blood, Miracle and Mystery: Alaska. One of the better ones until Miracle came along, was Mystery: Alaska I think. In this movie a local village ice hockey team is challenged by the New York Rangers.In The Netherlands ice hockey isn't popular and not shown during regular sportprogrammes. I find this to be a big disappointment, because to me ice hockey is the fastest and coolest sport to watch and do.The reason why the movie Miracle got on videotape so fast in The Netherlands (it wasn't shown in theaters), is because the movie is very pro-American and chauvinistic. I myself am pretty pro-America and I think that we could use some more patriotism in The Netherlands. There aren't many people in The Netherlands who are actually proud of their country.What I liked about the movie Miracle was the winnersmentality amongst the players. In Dutch sports this mentality is often absent. Take a look at the Dutch soccer team during the last few world championships and European championships.Anyways, Miracle is the best hockey movie there is right now.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Do YOU believe in Miracles?,"Just saw ""MIRACLE""  the true story of the 1980 US Hockey team starring Kurt Russell...Most os us around here (ahem) are old enough to remember the 1980 Olympics. What I liked about this movie was though the world experienced the thrill of the US v. USSR victory, we never understood what those ""kids"" (median age of the team...21), went through...how they trained, and fought through injury, adversity, doubt, heartache and heartbreak.  They went from being stars of their college hometeams, to being one team...unified, and learned how to become a family.  With that, they carried the weight of a country's belief on their backs.  The Iranian hostage crisis, the gas shortages, the sting of Viet Nam still lingering, they found a way to bring hope back into the human spirit.There is a small, albeit quiet moment in the film that shows the beautiful NYC skyline, in its full 1980 glory.  The moment passes, but we see those towers again, standing tall and proud, and I was reminded again about the belief and hope we have always had as a nation...that through adveristy, we will continue building and believing in miracles.Go see it....",9.0,Anonymous,History

Solid inspiring sports story,"The first time I watched Miracle I was thoroughly underwhelmed by it. I think there are times, with movies based on a point in history that I already know, where I get disinterested until the inevitable happens. It's like I sit down only looking for one thing, and the rest of the movie is getting in the way of me and that moment. However, revisiting the film this time, I found it much more engaging. I'm always a sucker for the story of the underdog sports team that learns a new way to play from a passionate coach, and then wins against all odds. It's a tried and true formula, and Miracle delivers on that formula in a fully satisfying fashion. Of course, when you have a film that fits so squarely into a niche, it can start to feel cliche at times. I can overlook this because I am a sports fan, and there's something thrilling even when it's only being simulated in a film.I did find the hockey scenes felt fairly authentic. It's a fast-paced, full-contact sport and somehow they made it all look real despite the fact that they could never let the actors risk their safety filming some of these shots. There's also something extra satisfying that stems from the fact that this wasn't all that far back in history. This meant that they could interview people who were actually there in order to inform some of the choices they made, and to maintain the accuracy of certain details. During some of the big games, they could even use actual play-by-play calls from the original TV broadcast. I'm sure there are plenty of details that were given a little extra Hollywood magic to make them feel more cinematic, but most of the way through Miracle felt like a good recreation of this big event in US sports history. I enjoyed Miracle so much on this rewatch that I will probably seek it out again in the future.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Kurt Russell is the only good thing about this movie,"First off let me say that I'm a big fan of Kurt Russell and I wish he got more attention and praise. I rented this film based mainly on the fact that he was in it. Too bad that the only thing I thought was any good about the movie was Kurt Russell.Some of the problems with the movie.The hockey team members are not developed as individual characters. Frankly, they all looked alike and acted alike to me.The movie tries to make the viewer feel awe, patriotism, and pride not by the actions of the characters but by SWELLING MUSIC. This is a typical Disney film technique. To make up for the lack of characterization, simply put in some emotional music. It was particularly annoying in this film.The film tries to blend in the history of the era but it doesn't do a very good job.You don't learn anything about the game of hockey from this movie.So, I would only recommend this movie if you like Kurt Russell. If the movie is about anything, it's about his character. He was a player on a team that lost and now he's a coach and wants to win. This explains his motivation.I would recommend ""The Greatest Game Ever Played"" the recent Disney movie about golf over this film.As for Kurt, I think he's one of the best actors around, always interesting, and deserves a heck of a lot more recognition.",,Anonymous,History
One of those movies that you want to watch before a hockey game.,"This is the type of movie, that you would want to watch before a hockey game, because it just pumps you up. This movie really did show what hockey is about. It is not only a sport you play, but it is a sport you play with passion and hard work. The story was told really well, and the way they made the goals exactly how they really scored them was really cool. This movie is a hockey classic film. All hockey fans should see it, if you don't then you aren't a real hockey fan. Go rent it for 4 bucks it is worth it. The only things I didn't like about it, is that some parts were boring, they should have put more action stuff and less talking.

I Believe,"This, ladies and gentlemen, was a great movie.Of all of the hockey films that have come out (mostly by Disney, for some reason) in recent years, this one gives you the best feel for what the greatest moment in sports history was like.Though some liberties were taken with the storyline - there were no fights in practice, Eruzione didn't end the skate-til-you-puke session in Norway, and the pre-game speech that Kurt Russell gave was never made - this story is the ultimate good guys beat the bad guys film.There were many things about the story of the USA team that I'd forgotten in the intervening years: how Eruzione had come close to being cut, about O'Callahan being hurt in the prelims, and even about how players used to celebrate a goal by pouring out onto the ice. (That practice was actually legislated away for the 1984 Olympics in Sarajevo by the IIHF.) The fact that the O'Connors went out of their way to find hockey players and make them actors lends more credibility to the game sequences. The sticks and uniforms were basically accurate - though I don't believe the Tuuk blades were around back in 1980; I could be wrong, though.I do know at least one person who doesn't care for the film, but that's because she's from Russia, and to her (at least) the bad guys won.Overall, this is a film that can get a hockey fan through a long off-season - or an idiotic self-inflicted labor dispute.",9.0,Anonymous,History
not a single original moment,"Those who made 'Miracle' seem to think that none of us have ever seen a movie about a sports team before. Even though it is based on a true story, the film is so derivative and formulaic that you could practically write the screenplay yourself (had scenarist Eric Guggenheim not already done it for you, that is). Despite the best efforts of Kurt Russell in the lead role, there isn't a single original or surprising moment in the entire 134 minutes that the film takes to drag us through its story.Russell plays Herb Brooks, a hockey coach from Minnesota who fulfills his dream of leading an American team to a gold medal against the Soviets in the 1980 Winter Olympics at Lake Placid. Brooks is the ultimate sports film stereotype: a coach driven to extremes to make his team the best that it can be. More drill sergeant than coach, he pushes his players almost to the breaking point, carrying his 'tough love' philosophy nearly to the level of sadism. But, of course, this uncompromising taskmaster is just what this ragtag collection of hockey players needs to achieve cohesion and discipline, break through their underdog status, and pull off a 'miraculous' win on the ice. And this is also what eventually earns him the undying respect and allegiance of his players, fellow coaches and financial backers, all of whom greet Brooks with initial skepticism until they see the miracle he is able to perform.It's hard to overestimate just how vapid and corny most of 'Miracle' turns out to be. The boys have so little personality that they quickly become both interchangeable as teammates and indistinguishable as individuals. Patricia Clarkson plays the stereotypical loving wife who nevertheless whines and pouts endlessly because her hubby is devoting all his time to the team and none to the family at home. Much of the dialogue is of the rah-rah, pep talk, we-are-family variety, made all the more mawkish by a lugubrious symphonic score droning on incessantly in the background.The raison d'etre that is supposed to separate 'Miracle' from all those countless films that have come before it is the fact that this team beat the Soviets at a time when not only was the Cold War at its height but the Russians had just invaded Afghanistan, the Iranians were holding American citizens hostage, and American motorists were stuck in long gas lines during the peak of the 'energy crisis.' We even hear a snippet of President Carter's infamous 'malaise' speech to underscore just how badly Americans were feeling about themselves and how much of a moral boost this victory gave to the beleaguered nation. The film, however, despite its good intentions, is simply not rich or resonant enough to sustain this broader theme. Thus, even with all the swelling music and inspirational speeches, 'Miracle' can't overcome the triteness at its core. 'Miracle' is a feel-good movie for the easily impressed.",,Anonymous,History

"This is the Rocky of Hockey, with a better ending yet!","9 / 10.  This is the Rocky of Hockey, with a better ending.  Tampa hosted a sneak preview.   The line to get in was long, akin to the Saturday matinee lines I remember from the 50s.  Miracle gives you more value for your movie dollar than any alternative playing today, if smiling all the way home is a goal.Ironically, Miracle underscores that hard work, discipline, focus and `wanting it badly enough' is what it takes to win - everything EXCEPT a miracle in fact.  Super stars - the most talented - aren't the ingredients that get the job done.  Unification of the human spirit - developing the will to win - is by far the more important element.Kurt Russell is brilliant.  Patricia Clarkson (wife) peppers sage advice that influences Herb's thinking and his evolution as a coach.  Listen to her words.  The team members were unknown actors (to me).  But just as they were the right players for the team in Brooks' view, every one was the right actor for the film.The demand for Herb Brooks' autobiography will skyrocket.  This is a man of vision, whose mind records an opponent's vulnerability so that he can compete and win against it.  He has this innate understanding of how a coach molds solid individual talent into a team . . . a family.  Every smart CEO across the land will use metaphors and clips from this great film to inspire their corporate personnel to go and do likewise.  I know this because it happened with Hoosiers; Miracle is Hoosiers-on-steroids (quite possibly the most inappropriate sports simile ever written :-).The hockey play is superbly choreographed.  The psychology of the game - as well as the heart and mind of the player  - is explored in depth.  You can't help but learn the mechanics of the game along the way.  Whether a current hockey fan or not, you'll better understand the game two hours after the the film starts, an unintentional benefit.This film made me 'prouder YET' to be an American.  To live in a land that produces the likes of Herb Brooks and this caliber of cinderella team.  My blood was pumping.  I suddenly wanted to be in better shape; vowed to be more focused on goals in my own life.  I knew these games occurred many years ago, but the movie made me feel like it all happened yesterday.Don't exit too quickly unless knowing what the players are doing now is unimportant.

Somehow it worked,"The acting, Kurt Russell notably excluded, was not good. The direction was average. The script was a little better than average. The story was--true though it was--the archetypal ""Cinderella story"" and there were no surprises--through that story pattern and the fact that we all know what happened in reality.But during the game, I was on the edge of my seat and gripping the armrests and after the film ended, I left the theater walking on air. I can't figure out what the filmmakers did right, but somehow this movie got a little bit of what ""Rocky"" got entirely. ""Rocky"" had a surprise at the end, great acting overall (Don't knock Stallone for that one--save that for ""Judge Dredd"" and ""Demolition Man."") and a very well-written script, but there's something extra to it that pushes it to its brilliant level. Somehow, we feel for Rocky Balboa in a way that we do not feel for all Cinderella stories. Somehow we connect and that's where the film's power lies.""Miracle"" did the same thing, but just lacked the technical feats of ""Rocky."" I could complain about the poor acting of most of the players, the silly switching between new Al Michaels commentary and old that was very obvious (his voice sounded totally different), the smarmy story, and a dozen other such things; but movies are about experiences and I had a great experience. No, it's not ""Rocky""--but it's not ""The Mighty Ducks,"" either. It's more on a level with ""Rudy,"" another great sports Cinderella story, because I can't explain how it worked, but it did. There were people in the theater clapping and cheering during the game as though we were watching it live--proving to me that it is true that you can't get a film's full experience without being in a theater.One small detail about this film that impressed me, though, was its portrayal of the Soviets. They aren't evil robots--when we see them after they lose, there is a respect in their eyes that we never see in film portrayals of Soviets and there is a great respect shown between the two coaches every time they interact (though just with their faces). The Soviets are humanized much more here than I expected and I think that humanity was part of the film's ultimate strength.Kurt Russell was excellent as well. I couldn't help but think, ""Snake Pliskin as a Canadian hockey coach? How is that going to work?"" but it did.I haven't seen him do much, but I hadn't really thought of Kurt Russell as a serious actor--so his excellent performance caught me by surprise and got me caught up in his character, except for the scenes with his wife, in which she was written and played so badly that it became embarrassing. A perfect example is when she and he have a fight while he's watching game film. The fight is stupid and unbelievable and we can't see any emotion in her, but then after he returns to watching film and we see him sitting alone, Russell manages to create a moment that most actors would kill to get--and it's all in his eyes.There may not be much to this film, but it's certainly worth seeing. There are laughs in the right places, there's an excellent performance by Kurt Russell, and there's a purely upbeat storyline--just don't look for anything more. Don't expect ""Citizen Kane"" and you won't be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,History

I just don't like sports movies,"Kurt Russell is one of my all-time favorite actors but I am not a huge sports fan, and I often find the majority of sports-related film adaptations (Remember the Titans, Hoosiers, etc.) quite boring. Don't get me wrong -- some are rather entertaining, but for the most part, the standard routine (underdog team that goes through tough training with a strict coach and learns the secret to success) gets on my nerves. It's just the same formula used over and over again.Disney's Miracle is a commendable effort, based on a true story and featuring some OK performances, but Russell seems strangely out of place and the movie itself offers nothing new. Might as well call this Mighty Ducks Redux: The Serious True-Life Version.If you're a fan of sports movies, you'll enjoy it. If not, stay away. I only found it sporadically amusing.

miracle,"Miracle is a good movie about the 1980 winter Olympics. This movie is about a how the US hockey team defeated the soviets it was the USA second gold medal. Throughout the film the hockey team goes through many trials, but they use their weaknesses and turn them into strengths. This movie seemed pretty spot on with the depiction of how difficult it was to win against this team, and how good it felt to win. The director to this movie is Gavin O'Connor, he did a good job on making you feel anxious or jumpy on whether or not the puck was going to score. I have never seen any other movie by this director but he did a great job with this film. Overall I thought this was a great movie and I would recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Hockey Excellent from a Hockey Fan,This movie surpassed my expectations with Kurt becoming Herb Brooks and the hockey scenes being so believable because of using ex hockey players.  I also was a teenager during this time and the movie caught the essence of the time with so many unsure of the US place in the world.  A country on the decline or on the rise.  I still remember being at a high school basketball game when it was announced that the US beat the Russians.I have been a season ticket holder to Gopher Hockey for alot of years. Kurt became Herb Brooks for me and the movie caught the feeling of what hockey means to Minnesota and to the New England states.,10.0,Anonymous,History
"by far, the best movie of 2004 so far!!!","When going into the theater to see this movie, I had high doubts. For one, I thought since it was a Disney movie, it would be another ""believe-in-yourself"" tearjerker. Also, I was turned off by the 2 1/2 hour runtime. Boy was a wrong!I never saw myself feeling bored and even though the outcome is known, the energy was right there with me and I found myself on the edge of my seat. Disney did an amazing job portraying this amazing hockey team.The story was evenly told and acting was superb. Kudos to Kurt Russell in his excellent portrayal of Herb Brooks. The entire cast was impeccable.Although not a ""perfect"" movie, it is still a great treat to watch and it is definately a great feel-good movie. You will leave the theater feeling overjoyed. It is one of the best family movies I have seen in awhile and I feel that it will entertain many years from now. I give this movie 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Miracles come...if you believe.,"At times, I remembered where I was when some of the world's famous sporting miracles happened. Here in my country where people can be football-crazy at times (soccer in American English), we are more accustomed with football-relating events. With the current FIFA World Cup in Germany (football's biggest prize) still happening at the moment, I thought it's kind of a little freaky I saw this last night on the cable here.I had actually once watched this on the cable before. But back then I was watching more of the scene where it's USA against the Soviet Union. Now it's re-watching practically more or less the whole thing again. It's based on the real-life events leading to the 1980 Winter Olympics.Though it's months before the showdown in the 1980 Winter Olympics, Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell) had already started with preparations for the ice hockey team. His tactics might had deemed radical at times to those around him, but then he still stuck to his guns.Because he knew what it feels like to almost winning that elusive goal medal once. Brooks, who was once part of the national ice hockey team, was cut out at the last minute in 1960 Winter Olympics and eventually witnessing from the TV his fellow teammates winning. He don't want history to repeat in front of his charges again.So after all that intense preparation, the big day beckons. People are starting to believe their national team can beat the seemingly-talented Soviets. Well...what happens after that is for everyone to see. It was the period of the Cold War then...but when miracles happened, everyone started to believe in their country once again.At times I do ask myself if I really believe in miracles. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. Sporting miracles are for those who really dare to believe because, who will have given them a chance in the beginning? I seemed to be seeing it at the World Cup too which is still going on...Trying to find some real-life awe-inspiring moment? Then this one is a good recommendation for you.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Great Underdog Story Is An Instant Classic,"Miracle is rare gem stashed among today's big budget films:  It's truly a remarkable film.  If you're looking for awesome computer-generated effects, Ben Affleck paired with a mediocre female popstar crossover, a blazing hip-hop soundtrack, or scantily-clad hotel chain heiresses, this film is definitely not your game.  However, if you are sophisticated enough to appreciate great storytelling without any gimmicks, this true underdog tale will leave you feeling inspired.  Guys, this is our ""Steel Magnolias"" (in a happy sort of way), but don't let your girlfriend see you all choked up.Exceptional writing, acting, and directing all contribute to the film's credibility and raw emotion.  Kurt Russell is superb as the ambitious head coach Herb Brooks, whose ""tough love"" tactics invoke a mix of fear, admiration, and respect in his young players.  The rest of the largely unknown cast, including Patrick O'Brien Demsey as team captain Mike Eruzione and Eddie Cahill (goalie Jim Craig), shine as well.  While you may be equally unfamiliar with director Gavin O'Connor, he's done his job because you will feel like you're sitting behind the goal at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, rooting for Team USA to beat the Soviet champions.Miracle should prove to Disney executives that great movies can still be made without relying on 3D animation; maybe this film's success will provide some leverage in future negotiations with Pixar.  Corporate politics aside, Miracles is a truly a must-see experience for the entire family.  Even if you're too young to remember gas rationing or Mean Joe Green commercials, you will love Miracles.  Who knows, perhaps even Russians or (gasp) Canadians will love it?",9.0,Anonymous,History

USA Wins Gold; Russell should win Oscar,"Often there is talk of sports transcending life.  In this day and age of hype machines like ESPN, the line between athletics and everyday life is often blurred beyond the point recognition.  There are a few times when David Beats Goliath, when adversity threatens to champion the will of those selected few who always seem to rise above it.  A few come to mind, recently - Rulon Gardner's Olympic Gold in Greco-Roman wrestling, Kirk Gibson's walking wounded, one-legged home run off of Eck in the 1988 world series, Brett Favre's amazing performance in Oakland on Monday Night Football less than 24 hours after the passing of his father.  And then, the mother of all triumphs:  The 1980 USA Hockey Team.  A bunch of college guys, primarily from Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Boston.  The Lombardi-esqe head coach with a vision, a plan, and the unbridled will to mold together a bunch of role players, a few superstars, and guys willing to put it all on the line for each other, into a team that would pull off the most improbable and amazing upset in the 20th century.  Disney made a couple of key decisions regarding this movie.  First, they hired Kurt Russell to play Herb Brooks.  Russell is a former jock - he made it to AA ball in the Angels system before blowing out his rotator cuff - and understands the intensity of sports, and injected it wonderfully and accurately into his character.  Second, Disney used real hockey players, not actors, to portray the hockey players.  In fact, Buzz Schneider is played by his son, Billy.  The result is some of the most authentic and intense athletic scenes ever filmed for a movie.  The bottom line is this film is a gem; it's well made, the story is well told, and the hockey players do a pretty damn good job of acting.",10.0,Anonymous,History

However, Disney did a superb job in recreating the event that defined and accelerated USA Hockey.  One cannot help but experience the pain and pure joy that this event held for those that lived it.  Herb Brooks knew exactly how to motivate these men to defeat the hockey superpower of the world for the most prized trophy, the gold medal.  A great coach that wasn't entitled to a medal of his own.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Very uplifting and remarkably restrained,for Disney","This latest offering to Disney's cannon of live action films,following 2002's ""THe Rookie"",actually is able to do one better to the genre of Amazing Sports Cinderella Story by making the events of a very real,very legendary moment in Olympic and American sports history into a very tangible,almost ordinary and tension-filled occurrence.Kurt Russell,more known for his physical,tough performances in actioner flicks,sci-fi cult films and light comedies,shines in this film as the late University of Minnesota(and NHL?)coach Herb Brooks,who is charged with the daunting task of cobbling together an Olympic team for the 1980 Winter games in Lake Placid. His problem: he has to do it with a fresh batch of amateurs(i.e.college kids) and he has a grand total of nine months to do so. Even though the goals of the USOC is to simply put a team on the ice that won't embarrass the country in the games,Brooks,a reservist on the 1960 US Olympic Hockey team that won the Gold(and thus a driving plot point for his character),has his goals set higher. He wants nothing less than to medal,and knocking off the Russian team--a program that had not only won the gold the last four winter games(1964,1968,1972 and 1976),but was sporting a team that had been laying waste to all competitors for the better part of the last decade and were probably sporting pros,guys who had played together for years,thus giving them an added edge.Russell's Brooks is a difficult character to peg.Watching this film,you discover his coach is not an easy man to relate to or like at all times. He is driven,stubborn and single-minded enough to test the loyalty of even his most fierce defenders. BUt he is also the quintessential ""True Believer"",meaning he is willing to go to the mat to push for the best out of the diamond in the rough sort players that are facing high odds.PAtricia Clarkson's turn as his patient wife is another deftly crafted performance(She's also very good in ""Pieces of April"" and to a lesser degree in ""Far From Heaven""). Her impact maybe more subtle on the movie,but it no less necessary. NOah Emmerich holds up his end of the deal as the assistant coach Craig Patrick,who shows more with body language and facial expressions than words.Rounding out the main players and contributors to the movie are the kids playing the team. I was interested to notice through reading the bios that many of these youngsters were not only fairly new at acting but were very experienced hockey players as well. The characters themselves,real and very sympathetic,are given just enough character to flesh out the movie. The characters of Eruzione(the Captain),O'Brien and O'Connell are given the most shrift,since they have the most pivotal stories or roles on the team.LAstly,and most importantly,this film succeeds in that it stretches the tension of a story that the ending is already well-known. By grinding down the elapsed time of the team's progress,from exhibitions,through Olympic trials and finally,the games themselves,to each shot-by-shot,check-by-check,goal-by-goal,reaction-fixed moment of the game itself,as well as the moments before the game,at the intermission,and even the moments immediately after,the show's director O'Connor is able to raise the emotional levels of the film so as to allow the triumphant,joyous payoff to be strong.Given the emotional pressure points of this movie,Disney actually was fairly restrained in showing the whole effort to gain respect and ultimately victory,which was no mean feat,since Disney seems to butter their bread with movies that are ham-fisted in sentiment,animated or not.While I can't give it a perfect rating,this is still a strong movie that anyone who likes inspirational films will greatly enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Victory On Ice,"With a professional and intense performance by Kurt Russell as Herb Brooks, MIRACLE, the story of the U.S. Olympic hockey team's miraculous win over the vaunted Soviets at the 1980 Winter Olympics at Lake Placid, New York, is by far one of the best true-life sports movies ever made.Russell definitively captures the intensity of Brooks, who in real life just missed the cut on the 1960 Olympic hockey team at Squaw Valley (where the Soviets last lost) and has now been given the task of fielding what the U.S. Olympic Committee wants--the best team of hockey players.  But Russell is after something more--like the RIGHT team of hockey players, the right combination that will ensure not only competitiveness but also give a winning edge to the squad once the Olympics start.  Though he resorts to cajoling, temper outbursts that would nearly rival anything Bobby Knight ever did, and extremely strenuous skating exercises, the team gradually grows to respect him and, in one of the great moments in sports history, Brooks' team defeats the vaunted Soviets 4-3 in the Olympic semifinals, setting themselves up for the subsequent gold medal win against Finland.Aside from Patricia Clarkson (as Brooks' wife) and Noah Emmerich (as Brooks' assistant coach), the main cast of MIRACLE consists of real-life hockey players, not actors.  This adds a great measure of realism to the proceedings, as do the television news flashbacks to a turbulent post-Vietnam America and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan only two months before Lake Placid.  But MIRACLE is not a jingoistic sports film that tilts the balance so heavily in favor of ""our side""; it is simply a story of America getting itself something to be proud of at a time when we so desperately needed it.The real-life Herb Brooks, sadly, didn't get to see this film; he passed away shortly after principal photography was completed, and MIRACLE is thus dedicated to him.  He would no doubt have been as proud of what this film accomplished on the big screen as what he and his Olympic squad did on the ice nearly a quarter century ago.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"""Miracle hits close to home now, as it did in 1980""","Amongst the turmoil of politics and unrest all around the world, we see a man who emerges to conquer that turmoil with the drive to mold, temper, and test a group of men that has to be at its best in order to send a message to the world that the United States remains a nation of strong citizens, unable to be dissuaded by a literal nemesis of the time.  This picture is not so much about hockey as it is about the strength of fellowship, comradery, and the feeling and ambition to surpass a barrier that held back a people from success.  The camera work is outstanding; very seldom is the camera so superbly utilized in a film.

"Great movie, very inspirational","I really liked this movie. The action was great, and Kurt Russell's Herb Brooks accent was dead-on. I watched this movie sitting next to Ken Morrow, #3 on the US team, and he said the action and events were pretty accurate, although they had him left-handed a few times. I would also like to commend Disney for putting out a movie without the saccharine, and at the same time not filling it with foul language and nudity. The ONLY thing I didn't like was Russell's hair in the movie, which looked like a Devo helmet or a thick coating of shellac. Also, Herb Brooks was only 41-42 years old during the timespan of the events depicted in the movie, but Kurt Russell was 52 years old while filming the movie, and it shows. Nevertheless, Russell's acting is superlative, and you really feel like you are there. Watching the world events of the time makes you want to vote for Reagan all over again!",9.0,Anonymous,History

The USSR was at their hight of power and beating them was a real boost. This may not become a blockbuster, but, it's worth seeing. Bring some older kids and youth to this film.

Great depiction of what happens when you believe in yourself.,"Here in Edmonton, The Heartland of Hockey, and being a hockey fan, I obviously was not going to miss this one. Knowing minimal background about the Miracle on Ice, I felt that this is one movie I could not miss. Afterall, I was born in 1980! It was neat to hear the names of a number of players who I recognized on the US, Russian and Swedish teams. Broten, Ramsey, Tretiak, Mikhailov, Kasatonov, as well as Brooks, Tikanov and Patrick the coaches. From what I have seen of Brooks when he was a coach with the Pens, I felt at times I was really seeing him in the way that Russell played him. That was a real credit to Russell in the fact that he truely grasped the role and did it to pretty much perfection. The movie reflects on hockey players at that age too! Young, cocky, and with everything ahead of them, these young guys showed it in their acting.The movie itself was a very inspirational movie to see. The unbeatable Soviets were beaten by a group of young college guys back in the 1980 and what it shows is the underlying lesson that you should never give up, and that when you believe in yourself and those around you anything can happen. And it did. The camera work at times made you feel like you were a part of the game, some people in the theater REALLY got into it! There literally was an older man (In his 60's I think) cheering and yelling at the screen during the tense final game. While it was a little odd to have that occur, that is a credit to the filmakers in bring the realism to the movie.I would have to say that was one of the better hockey movies, and obviously the best Disney hockey movie.

The truth behind building a team,"""Miracle"" tells the story of the 1980 US Olympic Hockey team that beat the USSR at the Lake Placid games. The film gives a great account about how to put together a winning team and what their win in 1980 did for the United States.Kurt Russell, the only really well known actor in the cast, is Herb Brooks, the coach who threw out the old plans for playing Olympic hockey, and molded a young team into winners.The focus is on Brooks and his work during the short 7 months before the games.It is by far the best role for Russell since ""Backdraft"".Most Hollywood films of historical subjects get watered down, affected by too much ""dramatic license"", or tries to appeal to the modern movie demographic (read 12 year old males). ""Miracle"" does none of that.Having actually watched the team play in 1980 on television, the events during those games were portrayed factually. Even the clothing and other cultural items of the times were done factually. Herb Brooks and the other members of the team served as consultants so the authenticity of the story was maintained.Being a Disney film, it was able to use video and audio from the ABC network coverage of the 1980 games including the play by play of Al Michaels. It was a hoot to see the old video clip of Michaels and his perm during the intro to the big Soviet game.As for the hockey, be prepared to sit through most of the film before the action gets going. The main focus is how the team was put together and molded into a team, besides most us know how the game ends. The hockey action is real and intense just as should be. The producers cast people current and former hockey players.One quibble I have with the film is that it really didn't go into the ground swell of support the team got by the time they got to the medal round. 79 million people watched the game versus the Soviets on television and when the US team won, the nation went nuts. And that was even with the game being on tape delay - held for prime time viewing and the results had leaked out by then.Another quibble is the filmmakers spent a lot of effort on the sound for the hockey scenes (according to the DVD extras) yet the crowd noise in the Soviet game at the Olympics sounds off. On TV the place was rocking by the end which made the event even more intense. That is missing from the film.Even with the quibbles, I do believe that ""Miracle"" will become a classic sports movie much like ""Hoosiers"" has become. The underdog taking on an impossible task and winning, will always be a great feel good story.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Miracle,"""Miracle"" tells a fantastic story of the 1980 US Olympic Hockey Team's victory over the powerful Soviet Union. This film also combines important events in history, as we well know the Olympics can never create world peace as long as hate stands. But besides that, I believe this movie has made an advantage to gain support from the theater audience as they too were clapping, screaming ""USA"", and holding their breath to see what would happen. Getting the audience and myself involved in cheering the fictional team is something that I would've never expected. This film takes your mind off the acting and the technically the film has created, and puts you (the audience) in a position that you actually are at the 1980 Olympics in Lake Placid, and that your cheering on your home team (USA). The cast is amazing, the sport is more and more fun and exciting, and I believe that this film will do extemely well in theaters for fans of hockey, fans of Olympic Games, families, or any ordinary Jor or Jane looking for a good time at the movies. Bottom line, ""Miracle"" is spectacular in its own way.Rating for ""Miracle"" - 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,History
10 on a scale of 10,"This movie, though better, was similar to Rudy or Hoosiers or Rocky in that it was a sports story of success against incredible odds. I gave those others a 9/10. I've watched thousands of movies and only rated 19 of them as a 10. I'm going to make this only my 20th rating of a 10/10. The reason is because the story is so much more important, so much broader, and the payoff is so much greater than those others. Therefore, it had/has more effect on me directly. The only other sports movie that I gave a 10 to was Field Of Dreams - my all-time #2 movie.I'm not a hockey fan at all, but it doesn't really matter what the game was. It was the story that was compelling. I can't imagine that I watched the game live in 1980. I don't remember for sure, but I just cannot imagine it. I am pretty sure that I couldn't have cared less. I probably assumed they were going to get the snot beat out of them and, thus didn't watch. Because of this, I don't think I have ever appreciated the full significance of the game.The movie spends a fair amount of time bringing us up to date through the 70's as to what was going on in the world. The point of that was to try to lay a foundation for the event as well as to essentially lead us to accept that, in a way, this victory marked the first step toward changing the 70's disasters into 80's successes.But, here is the whole thing for me. Yes, it was interesting and very well done. But, I have to be honest. The last 20 seconds or so of the Russian game literally took my breath away. I actually started to lose my breath. It was so well done that I almost jumped out of my seat and yelled when the buzzer went off. And, believe me, that takes A LOT! In that respect, had I been a fan of the sport (NOT) and would have been watching during the game in 1980, I would have probably gone insanely wild at the end of that game. It was something incredibly special and the movie did a great job of building the suspense and making it real.""Do you believe in miracles?"" is the greatest sports line in history and now I really understand why.Also, I just have to say - Russell was fantastic.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Team Sports Story,"The core story of ""Miracle"" was Herb Brook's masterful deconstruction of the most legendary team in hockey history. The Soviets had dominated the sport for nearly two decades, but Brooks figured out a method to beat them, then had the guts and drive to put together a team that executed that method. And beat them.The film makes use of a number of period references, which help to explain why this game meant so much to so many in the US.   Some will find this jingoistic, but for most of us, it restores the memory of a time when teamwork did the impossible.Good story, great acting.

So I was a living spectator, on TV of course, of the US Men's Hockey team's miracle run to the gold.""Miracle"" gave me some new surprises about what it took for Herb Brooks (masterfully played by Kurt Russell) to prepare the team.  The first surprise comes with the simple passage of time.  I was only 23 years old at the time of the Lake Placid Olympics so I wouldn't remark on the young age of the players.  But now, wow!, average age of only 21.I figured the team had to work very, very hard to prepare and the film shows the rigors of Brook's training, both physically and mentally but I had no idea he had only seven months to mold them into a team.Sports shows always show last second winning shots of events, but I discovered how important a couple of last second tieing shots were to keep the Dream alive.""Miracle"" shows as its denouement, as expected, plenty of action from the game against the Soviet Union.  The movie takes you right on the ice and you experience the battlefield ballet that is hockey.  Really intense and exhilarating.My only quibble is it treats the Gold Medal game against Finland as an afterthought. As any sports fan knows, sentimentality rarely meets reality. I think for the US team to come back after such an emotional charge to win again is the grand finale of amazing feats they performed.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Rousing Sports Movie,"Even if you don't like the game of ice hockey this is a terrifically enjoyable film. Kurt Russell is excellent as the coach of the 1980 Olympic ice hockey team, all the young actors portraying the players give sturdy performances, as do the entire supporting cast. If you liked Rocky or Cinderella Man this is a must see for you. I defy viewers to keep from getting excited during the games. They are filmed expertly, you feel like you are right in the middle of all the grueling action. One of the best scenes involves the coach mercilessly working his team after what he considers an unacceptable performance in one of their games. It's a brilliant and disturbing scene that will make you squirm. The final game between the USA and Russian teams will have you on the edge of your seat, even if, like me, you know the outcome. It's just that good.Yes it is an unabashedly patriotic film, and so what? It was a time when America needed heroes and the hockey team delivered. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Worth Seeing If Only For Kurt Russell's Performance,"My Rating: *** out of ****.If anyone wants to watch something uplifting, Miracle will certainly do the trick. While watching the film, I found it impossible not to like it. This is a well-made film that is a definite crowd-pleaser.The first thing Miracle has going for it is Kurt Russell. Russell has had an uneven resume and from what i have seen, this is easily his best performance(although I have yet to see Dark Blue). Russell's performance as Herb Brooks is compelling and intense; it's one of the best performances I have seen this year.No one else in the cast comes close to Russell's performance. The actors who play the hockey players are effective because their not well-known (I heard they were hockey players but I'm not sure). However, Patricia Clarkson (who did nice work in Far From Heaven)is only adequate as Brook's wife.The director, Gavin O'Connor, deserves a decent amount of credit. The climactic game is brilliantly filmed. The other scenes on the ice are also compelling. The only time the pacing actually seems off is in the beginning and the scenes between Brooks and his wife.Miracle is definitely a film worth seeing. Like I said, it's a film that is hard to dislike. Miracle is just an uplifting experience.",8.0,Anonymous,History

A Time for Greatness,"""Miracle"" is truly an inspiring and uplifting movie. As trite as it may sound, Director Gavin O'Connor and Writer Eric Guggenheim's ""Miracle"" celebrates the triumph of the human spirit. The storytelling by O'Connor and Guggenheim, along with Kurt Russell's commanding performance eloquently distinguishes greatness distinct from excellence. Excellence is the conversation around talent, training, and pedigree. Greatness starts with heart. Coaching for greatness is the only game whether it is sports or... in life. Given that movies are the profound medium of this generation, a movie like ""Miracle"" that inspires, and asks people accept or reclaim their own greatness is such a breath of fresh air in the current climate of 'credible'- ""Life sucks"" motion pictures.Kurt Russell plays 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Teach Coach, Herb Brooks. In 1979 Brooks became the Olympic Team Coach-- after winning 3 NCAA titles as the coach at the University of Minnesota. He assembles a team of 20 to 22 year-old collegians to take on the Best in the World-- the Russian Olympic Team. I was unaware of this when I was watching the Winter Games in 1980. The Russian Team had won the Gold Medal in '64, '68, '72, and '76. They destroyed the NHL All-Star Team at Madison Square Garden in 1979. They were the World's Greatest Hockey Team. Brooks didn't make the final cut for U.S. Team which last beat the Russians in 1960. What Brooks and his young men accomplished in the Winter Games of 1980 was a miracle. Though as we watch this story unfold as told by O'Connor, what happens is not unthinkable.We are clued from the beginning what Brooks (Russell) is about, when he selects his team on the basis of one day of try-outs. He tells his assistant Craig Patrick (a solid "" good cop"" Noah Emmerich), ""I'm not looking for the best players... I'm looking for the right players."" 20 players make the final team. Like the 1980 Team, two standout: Goalie Jim Craig (a strong internalized Eddie Cahill) and Team Captain Mike Eruzione (a spirited Patrick O'Brien Demsey). Craig (Cahill) is fulfilling the dreams of his late mother, and enduring the financial hardships of his family. He still suffers from his loss, and looks to resurrect the greatness that Brooks sees in him.Ultimately, this story is about Coach Brooks. This works, because there are way too many characters (as good as the performances are). Kurt Russell's performance is powerful. Patricia Clarkson creates the role of his wife Patty as a focal point, in what could have been an after thought in less capable hands. Her Patty is Herb's rock, and will not take any crap from him when she reminds him of his responsibilities as a husband and father. She is tough, and his inspiration.What makes Brooks' story so moving and touching is that he is really about having his 20 and 22 year-olds become great men. He tells them, ""I am your coach. I am not your friend."" He demands from them more than they think they have to give, because his listening for them is much bigger than their own. That is a great coach. There is a stunning scene, after his team ties the Norwegian National Team-- coasting through. He makes the entire team run speed drills after the game until they drop. He reminds them, ""Win, lose, or tie. You WILL play like champions!"" No team has ever had the endurance to skate all 4 periods with the Russian. Brooks is a demand for his men to do the impossible. It's about heart. Russell has a moving scene with his wife before the medal round match with the Soviets. He tells Patty what he wants is that ""20 years from now these guys will look back and know that they left nothing on the table, that they gave it their all."" Before the game Brooks makes his team choose greatness or... not. He tells them, if the played the Russians 10 times, the Russians would win 9. ""But not today... Today you are a great team."" ""This is your time...""""Miracle"" is awesome. Kurt Russell gives the performance of his career. His Brooks is an authentic demand for greatness and ruthless compassion. The movie is also a tribute to a great man, the late Herb Brooks. During the closing credits, the actors playing each of 1980 Olympic Team members are acknowledged along with a short summary on what that member is doing today. They all have outstanding lives. So it was not only a Miracle in 1980, but also a life lesson. Brooks has an enduring legacy. ""Miracle"" is a great movie about the greatness in all of us. Thank you-- Gavin, Eric, Kurt, and crew. You have made a very special movie that moves, touches, and inspires.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent and Moving movie chronicle of a historic event.,"I watched every game in 1980 and then went along with several hundred other fans to meet and greet Jim Craig when he arrived in Atlanta to join the Flames. Shook his hand - great kid. This movie is a fabulous tribute and a lasting momento for a historic and inspirational US sporting event. It still stands as my favorite Kurt Russell film, and I usually watch it 3 or 4 times a year. His performance as Herb Brooks is riveting - right down to the Minnesota accent and the intensity of a coach with a burning desire to accomplish the impossible. Definitely doesn't hurt to have Patricia Clarkson in a down to earth supporting role as Herb's wife. If you haven't yet seen it, get it and watch tonight! You can thank me later.

Excellent trip back...,"Kurt Russell performed brilliantly as Herb Brooks. I didn't mind the low coverage of the gold medal game cuz the game against the Soviets was 'the game'. And as Al Michaels says in the final seconds against the Soviets, that game WAS the 'Miracle'. I didn't realize just how much of the movie would be centered before the Olympics and Brooks' training techniques...that was interesting to see, especially with them starting out with him trying to get the job. Too bad Brooks missed the movie, even though he lived it. He will definitely be missed!",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Not as much a ""miracle"" as it appears; good movie nonetheless","We've all heard the story: a group of rag-tag college kids bands together, gets in the best shape of their lives, plays as a team while being coached by a genius, and sucker-punches a vastly superior Soviet team that had won dozens of games in a row and routed them 10-3 in an exhibition prior to the Olympics (no doubt Brooks wanted it that way so they'd be motivated for the real games and maybe lull the Soviets into a false sense of security).The movie is well done, but it ignores what really happened: a group of future NHL players took advantage of their youth to get themselves into superior condition to an aging Soviet team that was ripe for an upset, on American home ice, nonetheless. For example, Ken Morrow, who played for the NY Islanders' four Stanley Cup winning teams from 1980-1984, had been drafted by the Islanders in 1976 but played in college for four years. Mark Pavelich wound up with the Rangers, as did Dave Silk and several other players, including Mark Johnson. Oddly, Jim Craig had a terrible career in the NHL, where his weak play outside the crease was exploited to the point of finishing him. Still, this was a great performance by a great team that was captured in what was almost a great film (a great film would have spent more time deconstructing the hidden talent this team had). It should also be noted that Herb Brooks coached the NY Rangers in the early 1980s, and never came close to defeating the Islanders, so either he wasn't as much a factor as we thought, or the 1980 Islanders were superior to the Soviets.The movie begins with a ""retrospective"" of America's string of humiliation in the 1970s: the oil embargo and gas lines, the hostage crisis, ""Russians in Afghanistan,"" and the general ""malaise"" that was prevalent the US at that time. It also portrays the desperate state of US Hockey on the international stage, as no one expected anything from the 1980 team, except maybe winning a few games in the early rounds and avoiding humiliation. Herb Brooks is hired to coach the team, and immediately becomes its dictator, refusing input from the people who hired him and saying simply, ""You hired me to do a job, and I'm trying to do it."" That was easily the best line of the movie.Brooks is shown to be a brutal taskmaster more typically associated with Soviet than American hockey. He believed that to beat the Russians, the Americans would have to train like them and even surpass them. Just as Bobby Fischer showed that motivated Americans can defeat the ""Russian system"" in chess, Brooks applies a Fischer-like work ethic to mold his team into an international hockey force, having chosen his players based on what they could do on their best day rather than their average or worst, and then doing everything he could to get them to peak at the right time. He pulls off the mission, as we all know, but the real story is how he does it. To this extent, the movie is one of the best ever done in that it shows how to beat the best at their own game. A nice little foreshadowing occurs when Brooks tells Johnson that ""that coast-to-coast stuff won't work against the teams we'll be playing,"" yet it wound up being what kept Team USA in the game.This was a story that had to be told, a movie that had to be made, and the job was done well enough to make this movie a must-see.",8.0,Anonymous,History
One of the best I've seen in a long time,"The hockey action was awesome.  Normally sports movies are a turn-off because the actors look horrible trying to be athletes.

Again!,"This has fast become my favorite sports movie ever. Most sports movies don't do too well because they are too cliché and done poorly, having sentimental moments at all the wrong times to try to bring the audience in.

Through the good times and the bad, they uplift an entire nation that is aching from the pains of war. They give the country exactly what it needed. The actors were brilliant, especially Kurt Russel. It had its funny moments as well, and by the end of the movie you fall in love with each and every one of those boys on the team.It doesn't matter if you don't like hockey, or even sports.

Yet we are the first ones to admit and attempt to atone for our past mistakes.I am a huge hockey fan. It is the most exciting sport, especially live (I have to laugh at the yahoos who called hockey ""boring"". These are the same people who believe a car going 'round and 'round a track is exciting). Herb Brooks coached my favorite team, the N.Y. Rangers. It is one of my life regrets that I did not see the U.S.-Soviet game--I was home and was watching something else. But I did see the Gold Medal game.I thought Kurt Russell's portrayal was outstanding. The hockey scenes were outstanding in their detail. Although I read that it did not actually happen, I loved the scene where Mike Eruzione yells that he plays for the USA.The drawback for me was hearing that failed one-term president Jimmy Carter's malaise speech---which instead of being inspiring, blamed the American people for his failings as a president. Oh yes, those halcyon days of double-digit unemployment, inflation and mortgages--which coined a new phrase ""misery index"" were truly memorable until Ronald Reagan took the reigns and reversed course.And I'm glad the Soviets weren't portrayed as lovable bears either.

The Moose Hole - Review of Miracle,"There comes a time when a nation faces a crossroad in its history, a time where it must choose where the country goes next. That choice, whatever it may be, will shake the nation down to its core and change that nation's populous forever. In the United States, that situation was no more prominent then in 1980. It was the final year of the Carter administration and on the domestic front, the United States faced soaring inflation, sharp increases in energy prices and high interest rates. The nation fared no better overseas as American diplomats were taken hostage in Iran and the United States butted heads with the Soviet Union over their invasion of Afghanistan. All this turmoil in the presidency of what was the `smartest' president the country had ever had, who in one speech seem to blame all his problems on the American people. No wonder Americans were desperately looking for something to believe in. That revitalization of the American Spirit came in the form of the U.S. Olympic Hockey, who came from behind to pull off one of the greatest moments in sports history.The story focuses on a rag-tag team of hockey players who get past their differences and rise to beat the greatest team in the world at the time, the Soviet Union. Herb Brooks has a real score to settle. In 1960, he was all set to be part of the U.S. Olympic hockey team and bring home a gold medal victory for the country. The end result was Brooks ended up being the last player to be cut from the team and he never had another shot at that medal as a hockey player. As for the United States, they went on to win the gold medal but it would be the last one for nearly twenty years as the U.S.S.R. (or the Soviet Union) would dominate the ice from there on out. That is until Herb Brooks becomes the coach of the U.S. Olympic team and changes the way they play hockey. Instead of going the normal route of choosing NHL All-Stars, Brooks makes a wide variety of choices that he plans to create the perfect team to beat the Russians at their own game. In the world outside the ice rink, political conflicts collide with the Winter Olympics to create a game (between the U.S. and Soviet Union) that would act as a symbolic clashing of strengths. That moment that Americans were looking for something to believe in was now. The story for Miracle, which was based on the true story of the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey team, was surprisingly quite inspirational. Why surprisingly? When an audience goes into a 'based on a true story' film, they practically know what is going to happen, so there is usually a great lack of enthusiasm in the material but Miracle combines the right amount of sports action and patriotism to make a rare nail-biting experience.If anything, it can be said Miracle lacks star-power in its cast but that doesn't seem to hurt it one bit as the 'no-name' stars carry the film with ease. Kurt Russell, who is best known in the Disney world for his roles in such classics as The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes and Follow Me Boys!, takes center stage in the role of Herb Brooks. Russell has the role down to a T including that wonderful Minnesota accent that never feels awkward or half-assed. What makes his performance all the more special is the fact that the real Herb Brooks died shortly after principal photography of this feature was completed, so knowing that Russell put so much enthusiasm and emotion into the role before the death of Brooks shows the real dedication of the actor in his films. Patricia Clarkson, who was just nominated for an Academy Award for her supporting role in Pieces of April, gives a decent performance based on the material given to her in the role of Mrs. Brooks. Granted the filmmakers try to show the complications between Brooks' dream and his family life but her role seems too much of a distraction based on plot. The U.S. Olympic Hockey team on a whole is exceptionally played by a variety of actors, each of which contributes a piece of his talent to create a unified representation on screen.Overall, any film, based on a true story, which can produce a movie-going audience cheering in applause as an end result is worthy of praise. `Do you believe in miracles? Yes!' This shouldn't come as too much of a surprise at Disney seems to have a knack for these sports films with such successes as Remember the Titans and The Rookie. They've covered football, baseball, and hockey. Can basketball be too far behind? Despite a wonderful showing, there are some things to pick at. One is the use of slow motion in the film. Granted this is a sports film and this technique is expected to be used, but in certain moments in the film, it just felt a tad awkward and wasn't necessarily needed. Another is just political commentary on the use of President Jimmy Carter's `malaise' speech in the film. In the context of the film, the filmmakers try to make it out to be an inspirational message, foreshadowing later events in the feature, when in reality it was Carter's blaming of the problems of the nation on the American people. Could it be inspirational in another sense? Yes, but not in the way the filmmakers were attempting to make it out to be. Miracle expresses how even in a time when a nation faces an almost uncertain future, the American people can still be proud of who they are and where they are from, in just one simple moment.My Rating: **** out of 5 (Grade: B+)",8.0,Anonymous,History
Probably my favorite movie of all time.,"Miracle is nothing short of an inspirational masterpiece and is probably one of my favorite movies of all time! Directed by Gavin O'Connor, this film beautifully captures the incredible true story of the 1980 U. S. Olympic hockey team and their historic victory over the seemingly invincible Soviet Union. As a huge hockey fan, I can confidently say that this film resonates deeply not just with sports enthusiasts but with anyone who appreciates the power of determination and teamwork.Kurt Russell delivers an outstanding performance as Coach Herb Brooks, embodying the tenacity, passion, and strategic mindset required to lead a group of young athletes to greatness. Russell's portrayal perfectly captures the complexities of Brooks' character, from his relentless drive to his ability to inspire and challenge his players. The chemistry among the cast, representing the team members, is palpable and brings authenticity to the emotional highs and lows of their journey.The film excels in its storytelling, balancing the intensity of competitive sports with the personal growth of each character. It highlights not only the rigorous training and sacrifices made by the athletes but also the cultural and political significance of their victory during the Cold War era. This context adds layers of depth, making the story more than just a sports film; it's a tale of national pride and resilience.The hockey scenes are thrillingly choreographed, immersing viewers in the action and excitement of the sport. The cinematography captures the adrenaline of the games while the score heightens the emotional stakes, making the climactic moments even more exhilarating.What truly makes Miracle special is its inspirational message. It's about believing in yourself, overcoming obstacles, and the importance of unity and teamwork. These themes resonate far beyond the rink, making it a movie that can inspire anyone, regardless of their familiarity with hockey.Overall, Miracle is a phenomenal film that encapsulates the spirit of sportsmanship and the triumph of the human spirit. For its powerful performances, inspiring story, and historical significance, I give it a perfect 10 out of 10! This is a must-watch for everyone, especially those who appreciate what it stands for and the incredible history behind it.",10.0,Anonymous,History

The greatest sports movie EVER!!!!,"At a glance this may seem like your typical David vs. Goliath sports story. While that is the theme, the movie is anything but typical. The true story of the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team, 'Miracle' is for anyone with a sense of national pride. Kurt Russell is legendary coach Herb Brooks, who defied all logic at the time to create the greatest hockey team in history. And I do mean team. Never ONCE does this movie fall upon the cliche of the final heroic moment by one player that secures victory. No, this movie is about team, about family. Early on Brooks asks his players ""Who are you? Who do you play for?"" Each player answers with his name, and whatever team he had playing for up to that point. Brooks never lets on that this is not the answer he's looking for. Only later, after a humiliating defeat, does Brooks push his team to physical exhaustion in a quest for his answer. Finally, he gets it. ""Who do you play for?"" ""I play for the United States Of America."" It's then the player realize that this is not about the individual. It's about one team, one nation. Now I'm probably being biased here, but Kurt Russell is outstanding as Herb Brooks. (Kurt Russell is my favorite actor) Brooks, cut from the 1960 Olympic hockey team one week before the games, was a no-nonsense coach. ""I'll be your coach, but I won't be your friend"", he tells the team on the first day. His drive brought out the best in his players. Whether through exertion, intimidation, an unshakabe 'anything is possible' attitude, Brooks was a force to be reckoned with. The hockey scenes, strangely enough don't come off as revolutionary. In this day of digital technology you might expect sweeping camera movements or Matrix-like shots to put an additional ""Ohhh"" factor into it. Instead, the scenes have a 'you are there' kind of feel to it. Why would this be? I think it's because what those men achieved in the Lake Placid games of 1980 was so incredible, that the filmmakers didn't need any fancy tricks to improve on it. Now I saw this film at a sneak preview that was undoubtedly filled with hockey fanatics. But I can't remember a time when I was with an audience that as so into a movie. During the game scenes, the applause was thunderous (and no, it was not applause from the theater sound system). At the end, after the victory, all I could hear was the sniffs of people crying. And when the credits rolled, accompanied by cast pictures saying where each member of the team is today, and Aerosmith's ""Dream On"" playing, the applause was thunderous again. A great movie to see with a crowd. Hell, a great movie anyway.",10.0,Anonymous,History

`Miracle' is an absolute crowd pleaser that you do not simply watch; you take away an experience.,"When one considers the odds that the United States Olympic Hockey team faced at the Winter Games of 1980, the end result can only be called miraculous-as is the case with the new film `Miracle.' Kurt Russell (`Dark Blue') stars as head coach Herb Brooks, chosen to lead the newfound team to glory. Even though the film is a tad conventional, it proves to be just as rousing and exciting as attending a real game. It all adds to the flavor of a great film that allows its audience to become a part of its magnanimity.As the film opens we are introduced to Brooks' character, a no-nonsense kind of coach who has a new way of beating the famed Russian Hockey team-by learning their techniques. A simply concept, but a crucial one. Furthermore, Brooks encourages his team to get to know each other and become friends.In one scene, where old rivalries erupt between two players on the U.S. team, Brooks lets them fight it out. When they are finished, he says, `That look like hockey to you? To me it looks like two monkeys trying to hump a football.' The point being that this kind of behavior and old tensions is not going to exist on his team. He also makes it a point to say that when the team puts on their jerseys, the name on the front means more than the name on the back. In other words, these men were representing the USA and they we not going to make a spectacle of themselves over childish issues. In the end, Brooks shapes the men to be more than hockey players, but heroes during a time when the Cold War was strong. They were a symbol of the breaking of barriers between political rivalries, and the joining of athletes for the love of the game. 	The film's strongest points are in its cinematography. In several practice and game scenes, the camera gets right in the action. There are shots where ice crystals hit the lens. This gives the film the essence of realism-its not a visual effect, the ice is real and these men, although actors, are real hockey players. 	Moreover, the camera does quick zoom-ins to grab the facial expressions of its characters; much like it would if it were a real game being filmed. This gives the audience another point of realism that makes the film feel more authentic. It is that authenticity that makes so many audience members want to cheer and applaud at the screen. 	It is difficult to find fault with the acting. It is almost as realistic as it can get, except for a few minor problems-this is a Disney release and its PG rating naturally implies it being kid-friendly. In one scene, Brooks yells at a team member for not wanting to play because he a bruise on his leg. Brooks orders his player to get back on the ice and walks away from his saying he is a candy-ass. The player's response is simply to yell, `What do you want from me!' This has to toned down from anything that really happened-if a player, whom is injured and tired, is called a candy-ass by his coach, it seems only natural that a few other choice words would come out of his mouth. 	Nonetheless, `Miracle' is an absolute crowd pleaser that you do not simply watch; you take away an experience. ***1/2",9.0,Anonymous,History
Incredible movie!,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. What Herb Brooks did was basically the impossible! To assemble a team of players to beat the Soviet Union in ice hockey was unheard of. He could have picked an NHL all star team, trained them for a few months, and would not have defeated the Soviets. He methodically recruited specific players with various skill sets and molded them into a perfect machine. If you follow hockey at all, you realize how amazing this accomplishment actually was. Kurt Russell plays Herb Brooks to a ""T"" and the other characters (assistant coaches, staff, players, etc.) are all believable. Quality hockey players who sell this as believable and realistic. I've watched this movie at least 10 times and knowing it was 43 years ago to, I want to watch it again. Herb Brooks was the perfect coach to pull of the impossible and nobody thought he could do it. However, Herb knew he could do it and where this was a will, there was a way. Herb pulled off the greatest moment in Olympic history.... Possibly the greatest moment in the history of all sports.

very entertaing!!!,"I was only ten years old when the US hockey team beat the might Soviet team. I do remember the pride that people took in the victory. The begining of the 80's was rough time in the US. This movie retells the story in a very efective non-heavy handed way. The focus of the movie is the coach, played by Kurt Russel. His performance carries the film, he brings energy to the film. The hochey aspect is handled in a great way, everybody know the outcome of the game but the movie builds to its victorious conclusion gracefully. Even though the movie recognizes the patriotic aspect of the story, it doesn't go overboard with it, which is nice, if the movie would have been made in the 80's the filmakers probably poured it on thick. It is the type of movie that puts a smile on your face as you walk out of the theater.Grade:B",9.0,Anonymous,History
This was a great movie,"I saw this movie last night and I loved it. Since I born two weeks after the Olympics I did not see the original game. I did see a documentary about it on HBO and I said to myself this would be a perfect story to make into a movie. When I heard that there was a movie about it I could not wait to see it. I think that this generation knows what it is like to feel bad about ourselves, everywhere I turn there is Anti Americanism. We turn on the news and there is nothing happy (I should not say that, the mars lander was great). This movie is not about America being the best, it is about giving America hope again. This was a Miracle, hockey players from all across the country played as a unified team to beat the best team in the world. This gave America something to root for and I can relate since 9/11. I know a lot of people are saying that this movie was just America being pompous but how can it be pompous when it really happened? Is Apollo 13 pompous? Americans should not be riduculed for having national spirit.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Amazing Movie inspired by an amazing true story,"The 1980 United States Olympic team was selected from a bunch of college players as the Soviet Union were a national team who had been playing together for 15 years. The Soviets were unstoppable and after beating the USA 10-3 at Madison Square Garden, the 1980 Olympics seemed just like another gold medal for the Soviets. Kurt Russel's performance is great as Coach Brooks and it's amazing how the players were selected. Brooks was looking not for a team, he was looking for a family who could work together. The Americans were believed to not even get to the medal round but something caused them to play unbelievably. After beating Czechoslovakia 7-3, Team USA built up some confidence and played in the greatest sporting event in history. The USA/Soviet Union game on February 22, 1980. This turned out to be the greatest moment in sports history and this movie really re-created it well. The actors were great hockey players and having Al Michaels announce the games was very cool.""DO YOU BELIEVE IN MIRACLES?"" ""YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""",9.0,Anonymous,History
Mighty Ducks Replica?,"Although an excellent movie about the 1980 US Olympic Hockey team, this movie is, for the most part, a remake of the Mighty Ducks. MD is about a hockey team that must disregard its differences to pull together and win themselves an Olympic title. In D2, the US Hockey team is pretty good, but must take on Iceland. (Even the coaches look similar form Russia and Icleand) In spite of all this, however, i am a forever hockey fan, and must give this movie a 7.0, just above average (have you seen any of the guys' bodies????

A very well made hockey movie with terrific acting and a lot of heart!,"Miracle isn't the typical type of film I would normally go see in the theater. I am usually not the one to see many sport movies but something about the trailer really interested me to see this film. Was it the fact that Kurt Russell was in it and this was his first movie in almost 7 years that didn't look like it was totally going to suck? Was it the awesome Dream On song by Aerosmith playing in the background during the trailer? Or was it just the fact that it seemed like a very interesting film to me. Well, I think it was all of the above. So continue on to read my review for Miracle.I got to see Miracle tonight at a special sneak preview. I was really looking forward to the film as being the highlight of the week. I walked into the theater tonight, which was very packed and had to sit up in the top row because there were no seats in the theater besides on the floor. So I sat there with a group of loud obnoxious college kids and watched Miracle.The movie stars Kurt Russell in possibly the best role of his career as Herb Brooks, the real life hockey player turned coach. Herb's lifetime dream was to make a dream team of Hockey players that can overcome any team as long as he can push them to the max. Well Herb gets his wish and spends every waking minute of his day, making the selected 21 the best they can be and showing them if you push yourself to the limit you will win the toughest and hardest battles. A lot of strong performances, great hockey scenes, and excitement lie ahead...The movies' acting was terrific. I used to like Kurt Russell but for the last six and a half years all he's been putting out is garbage after garbage. His last decent film was Breakdown in 1997. I think honestly though his role as Herb in the film was outstanding. What a performance. Bravo Mr. Russell I applaud your work. Patrica Clarkson who is starting to be seen as an actress also did a good job in the film as Herb's wife. I see Patrica Clarkson becoming a big star I mean she has three good movies now under her belt, Pieces of April, The Station Agent and Miracle. As for the entire Hockey team in the film, well there are way to many to name but all did a great job. The performances in the film were really something great.The director Gavin O' Connor has made a film he can be proud of for many years to come. This guy did one hell of a job capturing the true feelings and inspiration of this hockey team. And what about those awesome camera angles capturing the hockey excitement. I almost felt I was right there when the movie was playing. I wanted to clap my hands and cheer (luckily for me people in the audience were doing it for me). This is Mr. Connor's first main stream film, his earlier film was Tumbleweeds which is an independent film I always wanted to see but I haven't gotten around to it yet. I am sure after seeing this film, I will put it on my list for renters next time I go to the video store.A complete unknown named Eric Guggenheim wrote the film. I am sure with this very powerful and inspirational script will he get many more jobs in the near future. The man wrote a very touching, inspirational, and exciting script. Some people never achieve to write something as good as this film is so he should be proud.So to conclude my review, I really enjoyed Miracle. I would have probably enjoyed it more if I wasn't sitting in front of a bunch of rude college kids who did nothing but laugh for the first twenty minutes but luckily they quieted down and I got to really enjoy this film. It showcased a very powerhouse performance by Kurt Russell and the entire cast who played the hockey team. I was very interested in the story. I think this could quite possibly be the best movie made about sports ever. It's sure as hell the best Hockey movie I ever seen. I would probably give Miracle a 8.5/10. It was a really great film and might be one of the years best.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Well Worth It,"My wife took me to see a sneak preview for my birthday (Saturday January 31st).  I'm a huge hockey fan/player and have been for years.  When all this took place, I was only 3 years old.  Therefore I have no memory of the actual game.  The movie does an outstanding job of introducing the global climate in the lead up to the game.  The culmination of the cold war policy, and the rest of the historical events that were taking place at the time of the contest.  I also feel that the director(s)/producer(s) were very true to the match-up.  A much larger, physical, and seasoned Russian team against the smaller, inexperienced USA team. The movie was very balanced in that there is a lot of Herb Brooks' relationships outlined on and off the ice, his struggles to coach the team his way, combined with the excitement and great cinematography of the actual matches and practices. I give it 8 out of 10 for that feel good feeling, and 7 out of 10 overall. I might be biased because it was a birthday present though.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Definitely the Best Movie This Year!!!,"I definitely feel that this movie is and will be the best of 2004. Kurt Russel's portrayal of Herb Brooks is amazing and I definitely think it is his best role ever. This movie really shows how America was suffering in 1980 and how this unbelievable moment made everyone believe that things would be okay...that anything is possible if we just would believe. I was truly amazed on how well this movie was casted and how average Hockey players depicted such an amazing role of the 1980's Olympic Hockey Team. The acting was much better than expected. Everything about the movie was perfect, even the way they used actual audio commentary during the game was amazing. I think I cried most of the was through the movie because of how emotionally stimulating it was. This movie was definitely one of Disney's best and I highly advise everyone to see it, even if you don't like Hockey.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Great Moments,"With the Olympics right around the corner, I was itching for a dose of Team USA. This film hit just the right spot. Though the movie's poster and the blurb on Disney+/IMDb give away the ending (The true story of Herb Brooks, the player-turned-coach who led the 1980 U. S. Olympic hockey team to victory over the seemingly invincible Soviet squad), it is still an inspirational classic.The story is strong, the message is powerful and it is easy to leave the movie with a new sense of patriotism.Note: The final locker room speech is one of the all-time greats.Best Character: Jim Craig

This Might Be The Best Hockey Movie Ever Made,"There really haven't been a lot of hockey movies made over the years. I can think immediately of ""Slap Shot"" - which was a comedy and not a serious hockey movie. There was ""The Mighty Ducks"" - but that was more of a kids movie than anything. And I can remember that the story of the US gold medal win in the 1980 Winter Olympics (the same story told in this movie) was told in 1982's TV movie ""Miracle On Ice."" There may have been others, but I can't think of them. But however many there may have been I find it hard to believe that they would have been better than this version of the story.It's a hockey movie. From beginning to end it's a hockey movie. On and off the ice, in the dressing room and the board room and in Herb Brooks' home - it's a hockey movie. But it does a truly superb job of blending in what was going on in the world at the time - which is really what made the whole story so dramatic in the first place. The 1970's had been a bad decade for the United States. Watergate and Vietnam and the Arab oil embargo and a sputtering economy. As the decade closed the US Embassy in Iran was seized and American diplomats there were taken hostage and the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. The Soviet Union seemed to be in the ascendance, and the United States seemed to be in a downward spiral. Who would have thought that hockey - which was really not much more than a niche sport in the US at the time - would be the start of an American resurgence?This movie focuses on Herb Brooks - who was the coach of that US Olympic team. Kurt Russell played the part, and played it well. Brooks had a passion for hockey and for the job of coaching this team. It was a passion that became an obsession, fuelled by the fact that in 1960 (when the US had also won a surprise Olympic hockey gold medal) he had been the last player cut from that team before the Games began. Brooks took on the job and demanded complete control over the program. He drove the players - hard; almost to the breaking point at times. He was their coach and not their friend; he wasn't looking to win popularity contests. It was a fascinating portrayal of the man, who tragically died not long before this film was released. Brooks was the focal point of what was happening. The players, on the other hand, were a team. In the movie, that means that Russell dominates. The actors who played the players kind of fade into the background. Patricia Clarkson does a decent job as Brooks' wife Patti - who sometimes resents her husband's obsession with the job and team and game - and Noah Emmerich is decent enough as assistant coach Craig Patrick - who's often uncomfortable with Brooks' coaching methods - but this is Kurt Russell's movie, and the 1980 US Olympic hockey team was Herb Brooks' team, and Russell pulls it off well.The on-ice action is brilliantly staged and seems absolutely authentic. Even though we know the outcome, the movie did a great job of building up the suspense of that US-Soviet game, as a bunch of American college players take on the mighty and experienced Soviet hockey machine, which was professional in all but name, which had taken 2 of 3 games against a team of NHL All-Stars (blasting the NHL'ers 6-0 in the final game) in a tournament held a few months before the Olympics, and which should have crushed the US team. Like most anything that chronicles the tournament, the movie tends to skip quickly over the fact that the US still had to beat Finland after beating the Soviet Union to win the gold medal. With everything happening in the world at the time, of course, what really mattered was that the United States beat the Soviet Union. There will never be another hockey game like that 1980 game. It's probably matched in drama only by Game 8 of the ""Canada-Russia"" series of 1972. Hockey is such an international sport now, the best players are all familiar to us because most of them (wherever they're from) play in the NHL, and the top countries are all capable of beating each other on any given night, so this type of upset and drama could probably never be reproduced.I'm not an American, so the patriotic aspect of this film eluded me, but I am (like all good Canadians) a hockey fan - and I have to say that Disney put out one fine hockey movie with ""Miracle.""

Dramatic; Terrific acting; The movie wastes nothing.,"This movie is terrific, yet I'm not a hockey fan and I don't watch sports movies. Is it possible that a movie can be all about hockey and not about hockey at the same time? It's not a retrospective of 'the game', it's about people embracing a vision. The worth of this film, and most of the drama, comes from the acting, and from the success of the writer and director in keeping the script tight and the elements of sports, emotion, family, and country balanced. Secondary to this is the drama from the hockey play itself, and this is largely helped by the on-ice cinematography. A successful effort is made to place us in the period, to help us understand the social and political climate of the day; it's important and it's well-executed. Kurt Russell does a fantastic job as coach. Merely seeing a few seconds of his performance in the preview made me want to go see the movie. Each team member gives a top-notch performance. This is not a lovable bunch of misfits, thankfully, but a group of independent young men whose individual characters enhance the film instead of trying to define the film. Patricia Clarkson does a superb job of playing the coach's wife, Patty. First to last her performance was worthy of praise. Overall, nothing in the film went to waste. The dialog was very relevant, the pace was excellent, the content well-balanced, and the cinematography was apparently great because I totally forgot I was looking through someone else's eyes. The cast and crew can look back on this effort with a great deal of pride. I sincerely hope you enjoy this film as much as I did. Thanks for reading.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Russell Delivers,"After seeing this movie opening night (I'm a huge hockey fan), I have to say that Kurt Russell is definitely the driving force behind the film. Overall, it was a great depiction of the events leading up and involving the memorable 1980 Olympic win, but without Russell, this movie wouldn't have been nearly as good as it was. He stays very true to playing Herb Brooks as he actually was and it's a true honor to Brooks's memory to have a stellar performer give a great performance in his name. I've honestly never seen Russell this good. But then again, I feel like he doesn't do enough films that give him a chance to act to his potential. I need to also add that the kids in this film were OK, and at times you can sense that their acting is forced, but since this is a team movie, none of that really ends up being bothersome because it's easy to forget about the individual players and just focus on Brooks. Let's face it, this movie isn't just about a great moment in sports history, it's about one man's dream and how he made his vision possible. This movie is about Brooks, and in so being, it's all about Kurt Russell's performance.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Embodies the spirit of American sports.,"Miracle is not a good movie because it tells a story of ""The Miracle on Ice"", Miracle is a good movie because it brings forward all the problems this country was having at that time.  This movie made it clear that this Miracle wasn't just one for American hockey fans, it was one for Americans all-together because it gave them hope of better things to come.  As have most sports films created by Disney, this movie doesn't just focus on the sport or on an event, it brings real issues to the front and relates them with the way sports can bring people together.

Great Sports Film,"I don't know how anyone, at least here in the states, can come away from this film and not be feeling a sense of patriotism. The movie is focused around the 1980 Olympic hockey team and what they accomplished in route to the gold medal in Lake Placid. I felt the movie did a good job in presenting what most viewers of the film probably already knew going in...a team of individuals that rose to unexpected heights and pulled off a miracle victory against a superior team in the Soviet Union.I went to see this movie for numerous reasons including my enjoyment of hockey and being a Kurt Russell fan. Kurt Russell did a great job as the US hockey coach, Herb Brooks, who did whatever it took to bring a group of individuals together as one team, a team playing for the name on the front of the uniform as opposed to the name on the back. This is the kind of sports film that I will watch time and time again because it worked for me on so many different levels.

The accomplishment,"The story of how hockey coach Herb Brooks brought together a group of college age young men and trained them to beat the best hockey team in the world at the time, the USSR Olympic Team, at the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics.Some pleasant surprises that the viewer can expect is that the film is not just about hockey. Hockey is the obvious focus, but there is good ensemble acting and the spirit of teamwork, friendship and Brooks's tough love training methods make for a good sports movie. There is more to anytime team game than just the game itself. Also there is a lack super patriotic tone that pervaded countless 80s movies, even sports films like Rocky IV. ""Miracle"" manages to show a great event in sports that undoubted filled many Americans with national pride, but it doesn't over do it. The only pride in the film is Brooks's and his team's, which is just how it is supposed to be - it is their accomplishment. Though, it will make any viewer feel good. --- 8/10Rated PG for a few expletives, basically suitable for all ages.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"it shoots, it scores","When I first found out about this movie, I was reluctant to go see it because I could still remember too well the way the story played out in real life.  Even though it happened 24 (!) years ago already (and I was only five years old at the time), I can still remember the names of all the guys on the team: Eruzione and Craig and Ramsey and Broten and Christoff...I remember my Dad having to explain to me the concept of a tie after their game against Sweden.  And I remember, of course, the way they beat the Soviets on that February night in the most famous hockey game ever played. Up in our home in snowy, small town Minnesota, my family (even my mother and my sister!) gathered around our TV to watch the game, echoing each shout of `U-S-A!' as it came to us across the airwaves from Lake Placid.  When the U-S-A finally won the game, everyone in my family jumped up for joy and started spontaneously hugging each other in wild celebration.This movie can't quite make you that excited about hockey, but it gets pretty darn close.  Yeah, I finally caved and went to go see it once I started seeing all the positive reviews come in.  I found out that they were all well deserved.The tone of this movie reminded me quite a bit of another Disney sports film-the Rookie-in that it carefully places all of the sports drama within the broader context of family life.  While this will definitely help it appeal to a wider audience, it does mean that it's fairly short on hockey for most of its first half.  Nonetheless, once the movie gets out onto the ice, it does a terrific job of translating the speed and the excitement of the game onto the silver screen.  The attention to detail is really quite remarkable.  The moviemakers found dead-ringers to play guys like Mike Eruzione and James Craig.  The Minnesotan accent that Kurt Russell puts on in playing US coach Herb Brooks is really impressive (and amusing!).  And they even get the timing of each important goal right.I also admired the way they treated the Soviets--the nominal bad guys--in this film, too.  They weren't portrayed as blatantly evil in some hopelessly simplistic, Disney way, but rather, just the way they were: supremely confident, impassive and intimidating.  We also get to see that, despite all of their confidence, they're human, too.  They start cracking under the pressure when the American team keeps coming back, and we see them looking on forlornly when the USA players finally win and celebrate their `Miracle on Ice'.I've often thought that someone from another country could never really understand how much this hockey team meant (and still means) to Americans. In the years that have gone by since 1980, people have typically told this story in the context of how America was down on its luck at the end of the 70s and didn't really believe in itself anymore.  This movie will tell you much the same story.  One of the most fascinating sequences in the film, in fact, is an excerpt of a Jimmy Carter speech from 1979, in which he talks about how Americans have lost their characteristic confidence and faith in the future.But I've always remembered the Miracle on Ice as being much simpler-and much bigger-than all of that.  Thoreau once pointed out that people only really come together in times of great sorrow or great joy.  For instance, I'm sure that every American still remembers what it felt like when the country came together in the wake of the great tragedy of 9-11.  The Miracle on Ice was like that, but different-it was something that brought us all together simply because it brought us all great joy.  For those who can still remember what that felt like, 24 years ago, this movie is sure to bring the smiles back to their faces.  And for those who never got to experience it for real, the first time around, it may just make them want to jump up and hug someone. :-)",,Anonymous,History
Great movie,"Miracle is a fantastic film that deserves more buzz than it has received. I have watched the film no less than 20 times, and I like it more each time I view it. While the actors portraying the '80 Olympians didn't exactly deserve Oscars for their efforts, the movie does not suffer, in large part due to their earnesty.The only thing that really bothers me, for those of you watching the movie on DVD, is the captions. 20% of the time, they don't match what is being said. I've gone over them several times, and there are some seriously egregious mistakes. Doc at one point, in the captions, refers to Robbie McClanahan as Mike as in Eruzione. Dave Silk and Ralph Cox are also confused. Items such as these are complimented by many less obvious mistakes that are no less distracting.",,Anonymous,History

Makes Good Use of it's 'Rags to Riches' Formula,"9 out of 10Inspiring and exhilarating story about the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team that broke long odds by beating the mighty Russian team and eventually going on to win the gold medal.This film gives off a rousing spirit that can be equaled to the one given off by the classic ROCKY picture.  One almost wants to jump from their seat and cheer.  This a very unique brand of movie because you know exactly what is going to happen and yet it only makes it all the more exciting.  It has a marvelous structure that takes things from the 'blueprint' stage to the final stage.  You see everything from the hiring of coach Brooks, to the selecting of players, their rigorous conditioning and eventual molding.  You see how this really wasn't a 'miracle' at all, but instead just good strategy and a lot of hard work and sacrifice.This is a film that can be appreciated by a true sports fan as well as a player or coach.  It sticks to the basic story and by and large keeps things real.  There are no unnecessary story threads or exaggerations.  On the whole it is accurate and amazingly detailed.  It captures the era well and should bring back a strong feeling of emotion and nostalgia to those who lived through it.Russell at first seems miscast as Herb Brooks.  He wears a puffy hairpiece that looks absolutely awful on him. The plaid pants he wears look almost as garish.  His Minnesota accent seems a little goofy at first, but by and large he stays pretty consistent with it.  Eventually he starts to really melt into the role.  His body language resembles the real Brooks and by the end you start to believe he is Brooks.  The way he chews his gum behind the bench during the games looks exactly the way a real coach does. This is one of Russell's best acting jobs and deserves Oscar consideration.It's hard to find anything too critical about this film.  The ""Dream On"" song by Aerosmith, that is played over the closing credits, seems to edgy for the material however the rest of the music  is excellent.  It would also have been nice to see what the players look like today instead of just reading tidbits about what they are all now doing.  The crowd in this film cannot equal the enthusiasm of the real crowd.  It might have worked better had it been filmed in the U.S. and an actual American crowd been used.It is unfortunate that those in Canada dislike this movie because they consider it pro-American.  This film is not about politics of even hockey for that matter.  This film is about having big dreams and the exhilaration that comes when they are finally met.  It's just the same old 'rags to riches' formula, but it's very well done.",,Anonymous,History
"Same Story As The Last Movie, But Different","In comparison of the last movie made on the 1980 Gold Medal USA Hockey Team, ""Miracle On Ice"", the story is the same as the 1981 movie, but the story on how they got to where they did was a little different.In the 1981 version, Karl Malden played Herb Brooks.  Karl Malden's version was more standoffish, vicious mentally, played plenty of mind games with his players and used Captain Mike Eruzione as the team's ""whipping boy"".This version, Kurt Russell was just as demanding and could be just as vicious, but compared to Karl Malden, he was a kinder, gentler Herb Brooks.That's not to say in any way, this was a bad movie.  I throughly enjoyed it. The storyline was good and the action was wonderful.  You felt like you were there and enjoyed seeing the old clips of Al Michaels and Ken Dryden calling the game.  I liked that they used the old footage and not actors playing them.  No one else could imitate Al Michael's saying, ""Do You Believe In Miracles????  YES!!!!!"" when Team USA beat the Soviets.In addition, I liked how they incorporated the current events from the gas crisis, the US Embassy in Tehran, Iran taken over by the students, the Soviets invading Afghanistan and President Jimmy Carter's announcement of boycotting the Moscow Olympics, which followed the Placid Winter Olympics about 5 months later.  I remember all of those events and I liked the fact that it wasn't just a hockey movie, but a movie about the USA Hockey Team and the time it took place, since those events potentially affected the team.At the end of the movie, I really liked the 2 tributes they did for Herb Brooks.  The saying in one of the tributes was a beauty.On a personal note, I liked the players they used for the hockey scenes.  I recognized nearly all the players in the cast as almost all of them are former Western Hockey League players and seeing a couple of former WHL/National Hockey League players in Ryan Walter as the referee in the USA/USSR game and Bill Ranford as Eddie Cahill's (Jim Craig) double.I can't wait for the DVD to come out.",,Anonymous,History
review,"this past tuesday (jan 20) i was fortunate enough to catch a ""press screening"" of this film. if you are a hockey fan you must see this movie! it doesnt matter if you're american/canadian/russian/czechoslovakian /communist/fascist/democrat or republican. this movie will still hit home with you because it deals with dedication, hard work, teamwork and the determination it takes to achieve something worthwhile.the ensemble cast is solid! kurt russell deserves a nomination for best actor for his excellent portrayal of the great herb brooks (coach of the miracle 1980 gold metal hockey team)!!!on the content of the film it is rated PG. it seems that PG is not what it used to be. these days its almost impossible to actually take a kid to a PG film without being embarrassed (even some of the disney animated films are questionable). when we went to see `the cat in the hat' i was sinking  in my seat (because there were a lot of children present) as all the innuendos and crass behavior passed for humor (thank god our kids werent with us). . but i must give kudos to disney for this film! as i think back i cant remember if i even heard an actual swear word (a 4 letter expletive). there was no sexuality other than a loving kiss here and there between herb and his wife. the only reason i see to even give it the PG rating is for the inherent violence of the game itself. there arent many films that can truly be called a family film but this just might be one of them.if you were old enough to actually remember watching the game you will be magically taken back in a time machine to where you were at that moment (and you will especially be touched)!anyone else who has ever wanted to do something that seemed impossible should go see this movie!on february 6, 2004 you will believe!!!",,Anonymous,History
Miracle? Far from it.,"I was not alive in 1980 when the United States hockey team played the USSR in this so-called ""greatest moment in sports history"" so I don't know how accurately the events in this movie were portrayed, or if this movie truly captured the feeling of 1980.However, I do know and I knew almost immediately after leaving the theatre, that this film was no classic. Not that it was a terribly bad movie either. It just wasn't a good one. And that is by no means Kurt Russell's fault. He was great as USA hockey coach Herb Brooks. He had the midwestern accent and everything.I just don't feel that Miracle took care of its characters. It did little to develop them at all. It seemed like the entire movie was a race to get to that final game against the Soviet Union. All of a sudden in that final game, Mark Johnson was just so good! I didn't even know who the hell was supposed to be portraying Mark Johnson. The only players the movie really introduced the audience to were Jim Craig and O'Callahan. Mike Erruzione was introduced only long enough for the audience to forget what his face looked like. They totally neglected the rest of the team.If you lived through this ""Miracle"", live with your memories, they're probably better than this movie.",,Anonymous,History
Captures the moment,"Just saw this last night and, I've got to say, it does a great job of transporting the viewer back in time (assuming one remembers that time, that is.)  This is a well-done film.  It's patriotic without being jingoistic, inspiring without being melodramatic, emotional without being sappy.  And the political background of the time, particularly the hostage crisis and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, are neatly intertwined with the main story, without getting in the way of it or hitting the viewer over the head. Still, the ""scene setting"" nature of the historical/political tidbits really captures the mood of that unsettling winter.Kurt Russell obviously did his homework - his portrayal of coach Herb Brooks is very effective.  Possibly his best acting job ever.  But Brooks shares the spotlight with his team.  Using unknowns (except perhaps for Eddie Cahill, who plays Jim Craig; ""Friends"" afficionados will recognize him) for the players - all of whom can actually skate - was the right way to go.  The heretofore anonymous faces reinforce the depiction of the team of young unknowns that comprised the 1980 USA gold medalists.  You can actually see them bond as they endure Brooks' rigid, demanding training regimen.  The result is highly realistic.  You believe these guys as a TEAM.And the hockey action is, quite simply, the best in any motion picture ever made.  Particularly the crucial game against the Soviets, which (even though the outcome is known) is unbelievably tense.  And it must be pretty accurate, since Al Michaels' actual play-by-play narrative describes the action on-screen.  Makes me wish I remembered the actual details of the game better - I was a freshman in college, we had a West Campus party that night, and all other themes of the party were put on hold during this one.  Thanks to the evening's beer consumption, the game itself is fuzzy in my memory, but the excitement is not.Finally:  Don't leave before the credits have ended...",,Anonymous,History
I just couldn't grow to like this,"My parents got the DVD of this and I saw it. Twice. I didn't enjoy it either time. My mind cannot focus on anything that is going on because it is filled with too much light conversation. My mind also has trouble because it's in the head of a person in a sports-loving family who doesn't love sports too much himself. The only miracle is the one that actually happened and that this film portrays. This movie didn't make me unleash my temper, but it's just the hardest thing in the world to focus on. Kurt showed to me that he's a great actor in Sky High, but I don't blame him for being in this. You don't have to agree with me, but this is my honest opinion.",,Anonymous,History
Medals were given to the wrong teams,"I really liked Miracle, even though I have been warned about the possible cheezieness in Walt Disney productions. But this movie was great, close to perfect. It might have been perfect if they only could decide which team that actually won which medal.When the medals were given out to the three remaining teams, it didn't match what Kurt Russel or ""Herb"" was stating just before, and I quote "" Two days later we won over Finland..."", while a short scene shows Finnish hockey players facing USA in the last game. Made me wonder why Sweden was getting a medal and Finland wasn't taking their part in the medal ceremonies scene at all.I am originally from Sweden and I can tell the difference between Finland's and Sweden's colors. But it still didn't quite fit with everything else. Since I go the feeling that something was fishy, I decided to check it up online, and to my surprise, USA won the finals, but over USSR, and Sweden got third, playing Finland in the Semi-finals.So this means that the whole movie is correct until it actually matters, which team won what.""Do you believe in Miracles, yes, but not that USA was playing against Finland in the finals, they played with USSR.""",,Anonymous,History
Good but misleading,"Do you believe in critical thinking? If not, stop reading.  The movie `The Miracle,' about the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team, provides a great opportunity to use critical thinking, which shows that the game against the Soviet team was not as big a `David vs. Goliath' story as the movie made it out to be.But first, it's a good movie. Kurt Russell portrays coach Herb Brooks well. Brooks was a good coach who did a great job of preparing his team. The hockey scenes are exciting.  The team spirit and patriotism in the movie seem sincere and genuine.  Thumbs up.But back to the `David vs. Goliath' angle.  Was team USA a `David?' In hindsight, we know that twelve of the U.S. players went on to play in the NHL.  Some very soon after the Olympics were over. Some had long and fine careers. So the talent was there. At the end of the movie, we're told what the players are doing now.  But no mention of their NHL careers.  If they had mentioned this, we might not have seen them as such a little `David.' So the director only told us what he wanted us to know, to play up his angle.If we compare the U.S team in 1980, to the team in 1960, which also won a gold medal, we can see how good the 1980 team was.  Only two players from the 1960 team made it to the NHL and one had a career of only 12 games. Now, in 1980, there were 21 teams in the NHL and in 1960, there were only six.  So if it were 3.5 times easier to make it to the NHL in 1980, we might expect 7 players from the 1980 to make it if they had the same talent level as the 1960 team (3.5*2=7).  But many more, 12, did.  Furthermore, the 12 from the 1980 team played a total of about 6,000 games in their NHL careers while it is just 675 for the 1960 team.  So it seems even more miraculous that the 1960 team took the gold since it looks like they had much less talent than the 1980 team.  The 1960 team also beat the Soviet Union, who were the defending gold medal winners. Haven't heard about a movie for the 1960 team.Were the Russians invincible?  No.  But the movie shows the U.S. players watching the Russians beat a team of NHL all-stars 6-0 on TV just prior to the Olympics.  If you know nothing about the history of hockey, you might say to yourself while watching the movie, `wow, how can these young kids beat a Soviet team that clobbers the NHL's best?'  Well, that 6-0 loss was part of a three game series in which the NHL won one game (4-2) and the other was close (5-4). In 1972, a team of NHL all-stars beat the Russians in a seven game series.  In 1976, a team of NHL all-stars won the Canada Cup tournament, which pitted the best national teams of the world against each other.  This included the Russians, who won 2, lost 2 and tied 1. Also, these NHL all-star teams did not spend six months practicing together as a team like Team USA did in 1980.  If they had, they would have done even better and the Russians would not have looked so invincible. It takes both talent and team work to win.The old format of the NHL All-Star game also shows the value of teamwork. In 1950s and 1960s, the defending Stanley Cup Champions played a team of All-Stars at the start of the NHL season.  Obviously the All-Stars had more talent than could be assembled on any one team.  But the all-stars only won the series 10 wins to 7, with two ties.  The Detroit Red Wings beat the all-stars 7-1 in 1950.  In 1959, the Montreal Canadiens beat the all-stars 6-1.  So sometimes all-star teams get beat pretty bad because they have not had a chance to practice together as a team.  To make an issue out of one game (the 6-0 game mentioned above) is to reach a conclusion based on a small sample size. That can be very misleading.In the final seconds of Team USA's victory over the Soviet Union in 1980, the announcer Al Michaels shouted, `Do you believe in miracles?'  Calling something a miracle does not make it so. If you believe in critical thinking, you won't be so easily fooled. Maybe the movie should have simply been titled `The Upset.' But an upset is not as compelling as a miracle, now is it?",,Anonymous,History
Avoiding the sport cliches is a challenge and 'Miracle' is up for the challenge,"Miracle (2004) Kurt Russell, Eddie Cahill, Michael Mantenuto, Patrick O'Brien Dempsey, Kenneth Mitchell, Nathan West, Noah Emmerich, Patricia Clarkson, D: Gavin O' Connor. Audience-pleasing true story of Herb Brooks (Russell), the hockey coach that overcame impossible odds to rise from underdog to champion. At the Olympic Games in Lake Placid, N.Y., he led the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team to a big victory over the seemingly unshakable Russians. Working through the definition of a feel-good movie, the film exceeds the sport clichés with resonant values on teamwork, discipline, and motivation, while still working inside the formula even up to the projected game climax. Russell has never been better. Running Time: 135 minutes and rated PG for language and some rough sports action. ***",,Anonymous,History

the Documentary was better...,"""Miracle"" will come and go as a decent film, inspirational to Americans and hockey fans alike, but, as much as I would like to, I wouldn't call it a 'great' film.Kurt Russell cannot be faulted.  He was an excellent Herb Brooks in his cleaned-up Disney-fied characterization of the crass Olympic coach.Historically, the movie was almost perfectly accurate, in comparison to the HBO Sports documentary ""Do You Believe In Miracles"".  The problem lies in the drippy melodramatic writing (""They are starting to believe""... apparently Morpheus was in 1980 Lake Placid), and the less-than-inspirational directing.  In most of the game sequences, the shots were so choppy I couldn't figure out what was happening.  Most of the acting on behalf of the players was subpar.  Granted, in a film like this the actors have to be skilled hockey players in order to pull off the role. Obviously most of the team are hockey players first, actors second.""Miracles"" wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.  The film will come and go.  It didn't pull at my heartstrings, and I believe that Coach Brooks and the team would have enjoyed the film, but I think they deserve better.

I was there,"I am very proud of how this movie turned out. I was one of the three thousand extras used in the climactic U.S. vs U.S.S.R. scenes and let me tell you it was a gruelling shoot.It was during the heat wave last June, so it was 35 degrees Celsius outside and really difficult to breathe. It was marginally cooler inside but not by much. It was amazing to watch how they managed to pull off the unique feat of finally getting hockey on film properly. The camera guys, the grips and the assistant director (Pete Whyte, amazing) were all on skates. The extras were screaming almost non-stop for 12 to 15 hours at a time. I had no voice left at the end of it.But the coolest thing was this. After screaming ""U.S.A."" over and over for several hours, we had a moment of quiet while they were setting up a shot. Suddenly, slowly, a roar started to build, in wave after wave. We were looking around, trying to figure out what was going on, because the cameras weren't rolling. Finally, up in the rafters, we noticed that someone had hung a Canadian flag for everyone to see. The roar became deafening. Production assistants were falling over themselves trying to get up to the rafters to get it down because they were worried it would ruin the shot. Pete Whyte, in obvious awe, came over the P.A. system in a low voice and said, ""That, was coool...""He seemed to realize that we were running out of energy and as brilliant directors do, he came up with a way to get us up and running again. He had someone tug the flag down and toss it onto the ice. Then he did two things. He had a poster made that he set face down on top of the Russian net. When the cameras were rolling and he wanted us to react to the final U.S. goal and go berserk, he skated behind the Russian goal and flipped the sign up. It said, ""Canada Kicks Ass."" He then picked up the Canadian flag and skated up and down the ice, holding onto two corners of it and let it fly over his head.It was a beautiful thing. So, say what you want about the country politics involved in the script of the film, but in fact it is Canadian pride that shines in every frame.",,Anonymous,History

They use actual footage of 70's Cold War events and weave together the Al Michaels 1980 call of the Soviet Union game into the on ice action.  The only complaint is the lack of emphasis on the Finland championship game, which was equally important to Herb Brooks who was cut shortly before the 1960 Olympics and never won the Gold before.-Ari",,Anonymous,History

Good Memories but OK film,"This movie was good but not great like I was expecting. A purely hockey movie, it missed a huge opportunity to tell the story from the viewpoint of being a springboard to the Reagan era which ushered in a return of national pride and the resurgence of a great nation. Instead, we get little snippets of insight into what was going on at that time but stay completely focused on hockey. Since that result is well known to everyone, it seemed very anticlimactic and even forcibly staged. I don't know why but it felt hallow. Instead of being a personal and heartfelt movie, all it tried to do was recapture the excitement of the 80 Olympics. However, with the shock value gone by a forgone conclusion, it just seemed like the wrong thing to focus on. Don't get me wrong, it's a story that should be told and I did enjoy it for what it was. We are treated to nice, in depth moments with Herb Brooks. I just wish there were more character development like that instead of hockey scene after hockey scene. The actual hockey skills on display are quite poor and it was almost distracting watching the director cut in and out to hide this fact. Somehow I give this movie a 7 out of 10 probably solely because of the memories it evokes rather then its own merits.",,Anonymous,History
What you see is what you get.,"This is a pretty good inspirational reality movie. I think it compares to something like Apollo 13 more than some other sports movies. Russell is great as a low-key, but highly motivated Herb Brooks.I thought the movie was best in the early and middle going. Ironically, the actual ""Miracle game"" had very confused game action. The earlier games seemed clearer.Another bigger disappointment was the new play-by-play by Al Michaels. Michaels is actually a pretty good hockey PBP guy because he uses the range in his voice to convey intensity and action. During the live call of the 1980 game (back in 1980) Michael's voice tone said as much as his choice of words. But in the movie, he's so monotone and unenthusiastic that it's a let down. It would have been better to use clips from the ABC broadcast in 1980.Anyway, Miracle is a good values movie for the whole family. The kids won't appreciate the kind of US that existed in the late 70's. They also won't get the elevation of the players from rival individuals to a united, dedicated team. (The underlying message to the citizens of the country is a little too subtly presented to stick.) But some day your kids will understand.",,Anonymous,History
"Good Movie, but why ruin the Miracle?","This was a great movie to watch. There was a good mix between Hockey and story so that it carries itself across evenly and smoothly. The down side is that as a Hockey coach I believe Disney allowed the Director to Disgrace the 1980 US Olimpic Team by taking away there true hard work. This movie makes the Soviets seem ""cheap"" on the ice, and that I can tell you they were not. Anyone who knows hockey, knows that the Soviets could score at will, and they did not need to Run goaltender Jim Craig (which is what was shown in the movie) to score their third goal. Anyone who saw the real game knows that the soviets scored thier third and final goal on a defensive breakdown allowing the soviets to go in alone on a breakawy. I write this in the defense of hockey, do not take away from a historic event just to boost a dislike to a country that no longer exists. The US beat the soviets because of hard work, commitment, and teamship. Above all the soviets lost because of those same reasons.",,Anonymous,History

I totally accepted him as a hockey coach.I was surprised with the attention to detail in this picture. They had everything exactly right.

Sound of Ice,"As a pro skater, the actual sounds of the hockey player's blades on the ice were incredibly crisp in Miracle. For me, it made the games all the more real. Seems like a small factor to note but it is such a specific sound that was extremely well executed. Usually the 'crunch' of ice sounds in hockey or skating movies are contrived...takes a real skater to know these sounds and reproduce them so well. Maybe I missed it, but at any point in the film did anyone say, 'Do you believe in Miracles?'",,Anonymous,History

This effort by him, to learn Brooks' mannerisms, the vocal inflections, the nuances that set Brooks apart, makes you realize what (besides the unlikely ensemble success) makes this an inspiring movie.The film was assembled with archived footage and several old ABC clips which are seemlessly integrated and adds a level of reaLITY and authenticity to this. This is not a Scholastic film or an AAU archive this is a production that is accurate (mostly) and has that seldom used (or found) quality of drawing you in.

The part that was most closes to home was the relationship between the coach and his team. The coach was a real jerk, and worked his team till they could not take anymore. And the scene where he made them stay after the game that they lost to Norway, and had them do sprints felt like watching someone die...

Miracle 4/10,"MiracleIn this less than miraculous drama, story of the team that transcended its sport and united a nation with a new feeling of hope. Based on the true story of one of the greatest moments in sports history, the tale captures a time and place where differences could be settled by games and a cold war could be put on ice. In 1980, the United States Ice Hockey team's coach, Herb Brooks, took a ragtag squad of college kids up against the legendary juggernaut from the Soviet Union at the Olympic Games. Despite the long odds, Team USA carried the pride of a nation yearning from a distraction from world events. With the world watching the team rose to the occasion, prompting broadcaster Al Michaels' now famous question, to the millions viewing at home: Do you believe in miracles?I saw this on a rainy night at the theater. I had to sit in the front row, which might have made my viewing on this film different, but I still don't like... Kurt Russell gives a decent performance as the coach but, unlike Remember the Titans, the film focused on the team rather than the coach. And it's not necessarily terrible when a sports movie focuses on the coach, but I've always found the players much more interesting. I just saw Friday NIGHT LIGHTS, and I liked it better than this but not as good as REMEMBER THE TITANS.I know I shouldn't be comparing two totally different sport movies that aren't even the same sport, but what else do you compare this to? I was quite bored during this film. It's clunky, uneven, annoying, and worst of all boring.

Fantastic,"I saw the film at a special preview in Las Vegas (tickets were given to people who showed up early, in hockey gear to the local ECHL team a few days before the showing).  The film was not so much a bash of the Soviets (as some have suggested), but about a team who represented their country during a period of bleak news.  The country was in a recession, with double-digit inflation and interest rates, gas shortages, a weak president (Carter) who essentially told us our best days were behind us, and a Soviet enemy who appeared to be winning the cold war (taking Afghanistan) and dominated Olympic hockey.  The team gave the United States a huge booster shot in a bleak period.  If we could beat the Soviets on the ice (where they dominated the world), maybe we could also triumph over the other challenges we faced.The values of the story are hard work, dedication to a team instead of individual glory, and determination to beat big odds to win.  Was the team underestimated?  Probably, but they were underestimated because nobody thought a coach could push them into being the best conditioned team, and into refusing to be intimidated by the Soviets.  A scene, probably included for dramatic effect was Herb pushing the players hard until one of them finally gave him the right answer to ""Who do you play for?"".  Instead of his college team (the answer previous given by all players who were asked the question), he responded ""The United States of America"".",,Anonymous,History
Choices,"I was as wary as the next person when it came to this movie. How often are sports films just pathetic?This particular film, however, was fantastic. The choice to use hockey players instead of actors just floored me. There is nothing scarier than taking someone who has never acted before and trying to work with them on acting skills, becoming frustrated and just letting it go. However, the casting, and the work done with these kids was amazing.The hockey games are phenomenal, the choices of editing and cuts and various lighting effects just fit.The scene with the Herbies was brilliantly executed. The actors actually did all those Herbies for three days! The real team actually did them as well, for an hour after the game.This story is about as accurate as it gets in terms of historical films, and is one of the most exciting movies I've ever seen. We were inside the theater cheering and yelling along with the crowd on the screen. We knew how it came out, but it was that well filmed and executed that we couldn't help it.I'd like to end with a comment for the users who said that the light marked 4 was confusing because they were waiting for a fourth quarter. First off, if you know anything about hockey, you should know that hockey only has 3 periods, and that any given hockey scoreboard is also being used for sports such as basketball, which do have 4 quarters.Secondly, you'd think that after the first few games, all of which ended after three periods, you might notice something was similar.Thirdly, even if you don't know anything about hockey, this is an event that happened only 24 years ago, and is permanently etched into the American psyche. You would think that you'd take the time to notice a basic rule of the sport, but apparently the American way is to ignore all events that have ever happened, except in some sort of vague one word reference to it. The filmmakers did an excellent job in making what was happening understandable, even for non-hockey fans, it's not their job to assume that you're a complete moron and spoon feed you basic tenets of the sport. They didn't do a long sequence explaining that you score by the goal going into the net did they? They assumed that after you saw it go in, saw the scoreboard increase and saw people celebrating and calling it a goal that it would be enough for you. They didn't expect you to wait for the field goal point and be disappointed when it never came.Your own basic ignorance is not the filmmakers fault, so get over it.",,Anonymous,History

My wife, no big hockey fan herself, was right there with me, getting caught up in the action.The players and Herb Brooks are all legends here in Minnesota, of course. We sometimes forget that the hockey players came from Massachusetts, Michigan and elsewhere. It certainly brings back some good memories from a bad time in this nation's history.  For those of us who lived through it, we sure needed the win and this movie does a good job showing that need and the catharsis it brought to the nation.",,Anonymous,History
One of the better sports underdog movies,"When I try to come up with sports movies that are actually good, I can only think of two: `Hoosiers' and `Remember the Titans'.  `Hoosiers' was good because of the performances of Hackman, Hopper and Hershey, but it created little-to-no suspense for the basketball team.  Denzel Washington and Will Patton lifted `Remember the Titans' but that film was great because of how well we got to know the football players, and because of the cheery tone. `Miracle' is a balancing act, focusing on both coach Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell) and the players of the team.Brooks is, of course, the main character, but we never stray away from the players of the team for too long.  Director Gavin O'Connor said he either had to hire actors and teach them to play hockey (impossible) or to hire hockey players and teach them how to act.  Thankfully, he chose the latter. And they're not half bad, either.Of course, the best performance of the film comes from Russell  and it's probably the best performance of his career, too.  He masters the accent, the determination, and the anger.  He was born to play Herb Brooks.  He gets awesome support, too, from Patricia Clarkson and Noah Emmerich, among others.When I rented `Hoosiers' the cover said that the film was praised for its `revolutionary' camera techniques that capture the basketball action.  If those were revolutionary, I'm not sure if theirs a word in the English language that describes the cinematography in this film.  I was amazed by how effortlessly the cameras followed the wonderfully choreographed hockey action.  I don't want to even imagine the hard work that the hockey scenes must've been, but it doesn't seem that way.One thing I must say is that the movie feels reallyheavy.  It's so full of drama that it makes it sort of exhausting to watch.  That's the only flaw: I don't think I'd watch this movie twice.  It's strong and powerful, but a little too long and, well, thick.Still, this is definitely on par with `Hoosiers' and `Remember the Titans', a great sports movie and of the years best so far, 7.5/10.",,Anonymous,History
Kurt Russell IS HERB BROOKS!!!,"As a life long fan of Kurt Russell, I was impressed.  As always, Kurt Russell delivers the goods.  He had the attire, accent etc. of a hardcore coach in the era of Jimmy Carter, Soviet Union, high gas prices and the 1980 Olympics.  I hope Kurt Russell gets recognized.  Geeze, I had no idea tha Herb was such a mean coach!! He was a GOOD coach but he was very hard on his players!!  I loved that part where his team loses to Norway....and after the game, Kurt Russell makes them do skating drills for what appears to he HOURS!!!  I was shocked!!!  That was good.  The best part of the movie for me, was watching Kurt Russell go back into the empty hallway of the skating arena...and trying to not let his enthusiasm explode after defeating the Soviets.  Thank you Kurt Russell!!!!!",,Anonymous,History
This was a excellent movie!,"Even though you knew how the movie would end, it still had you on the edge of your seat.  I think they did a great job making this flick!! I remember when the US won the gold metal over the Soviet Union, I was so proud!  I knew those guys must have worked so hard and knew their heart was in their playing!!",,Anonymous,History
"Predictable as expected, but hardly fun along the way","After seeing the trailers for this film, I walked in with a very vivid expectation of what I would see.  Miracle truly didn't disappoint in this aspect, but unfortunately that's the only way in which it didn't disappoint. Miracle delivered a truly predictable sports flick that didn't even really make the journey very much fun.There are many many films in the sports movie genre, leading to played and replayed stories with smarmy, milked endings.  This one was no exception. Sometimes they can be pulled off without seeming heavy-handed or trite, but other times, they just turn out schmalzy and boring.  This tried story of a has-been-turned-coach having to deal with a team made up of a group of argumentative Hollywood hotties and the ensuing lives changed and unity formed contains exactly every single element the sports movie formula requires.  Honestly, I expected Emilio Estevez to arrive at any moment and instruct the players to initiate the Flying V maneuver and win the game.Aside from the thematic issues, there were technical indiscretions as well. As far as editing goes, you could tell what they were going for, with the constant cuts back to the timer and the extreme closeups, but it just didn't seem to add anticipation, just confusion.  Furthermore, the extended overuse of close shots often led to confusion as far as blocking and where characters were in relation to other characters in a scene, lacking some serious establishing shots.  Still, there were SOME good acting moments, particularly on the part of Kurt Russell, who pulls off a relatively brilliant Coach Herb Brooks.  The kids were all right for the most part (was it just me and my companions, or did a lot of those kids look almost identical?), but their characters still seemed at times overworked.In the end, it was all right, exactly what I expected, so I can't say I was disappointed.  But what I CAN say is it's a good thing America won, or else they wouldn't be worthwhile individuals, or so the sports world would have you believe.  ""It doesn't matter if you win or lose....""  Hm.  That theory seems lost on America as of late.5/10.",,Anonymous,History
The climax of the movie was ruined for me.,"I don't happen to know that in hockey there are THREE periods, not four quarters.  How many average Americans DO know this?  Then during the hockey game against the USSR (the climax of the movie) they kept showing the scoreboard which had FOUR quarters listed on it, and we were clearly in the THIRD of these four.  Therefore I thought that there was a full quarter to go, so instead of really going with the action, as the moviemakers intended, I'm sitting there enjoying the movie, but excitedly waiting for the 4th quarter.  Suddenly it's all over and I'm thinking that this was one of the stupidest oversights I've ever seen a movie maker commit.  The movie was good, if you realize that you're watching the last period of the hockey game.Pitiful.",,Anonymous,History
This is more than a Miracle...,"I was so shocked at how wonderful this movie was.  I wasn't planning on even seeing it but my friend wanted to and as soon as the movie began I was sucked in.  I liked hockey to begin with but now my love for it has grown and grown.  This movie is so much more, it covers sportsmanship, commitment, hope, and so much more.  This movie is so great, high-five to Kurt Russell, absolutely awesome job depicting Herb Brooks.  Absolutely wonderful, go see this movie!!!",,Anonymous,History
"Feel good movie, and a fun one.","I was lucky enough to see ""Miracle"" at an advanced screening for our local NHL team and collegiate baseball team as a team-building activity.  That being said, I went into the movie expecting it to be a good, feel good movie.  Incidentally, during many of the scenes where we played the Soviets some of us actually cheered during great plays, it was pretty amusing.  I mean come on, I knew the Titanic was going to sink too, but it was also entertaining.I thought that it started out very well portraying the prevailing attitude of Americans at the time.  Face it, the target audience was not even born when this transpired.  So it was great to get a background to what the times were like and how important this game was to the American people.Kurt Russell did a great job playing a guy that I had barely heard of. He was convincing as both a coach and a person.  I also liked the players. They were a bunch of no-name actors (relatively speaking) playing a bunch of no-name hockey players (at the time).  They had that youthful quality that the team also possessed and seemed to work well together.There was also some pretty good camerawork that went on showing the hockey, not just television angles like on ESPN.  There were also some pretty good licks taken by the Americans, a bit more than I expected from a Disney Film.Overall, I thought it was a very good movie.  One that is great for adults that may remember the times, and for those too young to remember but want to see a good/clean sports movie.I would give it 3 1/2 stars out of four for a movie that made us all walk out entertained and proud to be an American for a while.",,Anonymous,History
Quite big mistake,"At the end of the movie the voice told that USA won Finland and the gold. And then they showed the flags of the three best countries: USA, Soviet Union and Sweden (?!)The creators of this movie should have known the colours of the flag of Finland. Blue and white.http://www.cartinafinland.fi/sekalaiset/images/SuomenLippu1.jpgWell, at least we had a good laugh when we saw the flag ;) And now I have to write here something stupid, because there has to be at least 10 lines of writing before the system allows this message to be shown.

PHIL VERCHOTA AND MIKE ERUZIONE,"They really need to be in the movie more. Mike Eruzione, because he's cute, and Phil Verchota.....well......only because my dad works with him at the bank. Phil is huge, but he is so cool. He was the guy that was checking out the blondes in section 2 during the movie. And Mike Eruzione..... Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! You have to agree, Mike (Patrick O'Brian Demsey) should have been in there more. He was such a good actor, too. I also hoped to see more of Jim Craig, because he seemed to be the sports freak type. But then again, so am I, at least when it comes to the University of North Dakota hockey team.  And if anyone from the real 1980 team or whoever played them in the movie is reading this..... I LOVE YOU!",,Anonymous,History
USA!  USA!  USA!,"I had opportunity to see the film ""Miracle"" last night at a preview screening.  This is the flick with Kurt Russell portraying Herb Brooks and the 1980 US Hockey team's triumph at the Lake Placid Olympics.The movie is terrific.  Even though you know the outcome (and I remember watching the games while a senior at Syracuse), there is still a good deal of suspense and tension, as it's made quite skillfully.  The pacing is very good, the editing creative, and they build up the game vs. the Soviet Union quite well.  The hockey scenes are very authentic; I can only imagine how difficult it was to shoot, as well as how amazed the actors are going to be when they see it all put together.For those not particularly enamored of hockey (the poor souls), there is still a lot to recommend about this film.  It's got a ""Rocky""-style good feeling, explores the relationship between Brooks and his wife, the players' relationships with each other, and so on.  There is a good dramatic sense, but then, this is a Disney film, and they have experience doing these things, eh?  Having said that, however, ""Miracle"" is much better than ""Cool Runnings"" or any of the ""Mighty Ducks"" series.  Those were treacly, whereas this is inspiring.Russell (another Disney veteran) does a good job as Brooks.  His portrayal seems pretty authentic, at least what I remember of him from news reports and such.  Although the print I saw last night did not include the end credits (maybe they're not yet completed), one has to think that Brooks was consulted during the writing of the script and shooting for confirmation of details and events.  At the close of the film, there is an acknowledgment of his passing just after the completion of shooting.  It says something to the effect that while he never got to see the film, he lived it.  If only he had called upon his legendary genius to have used his seatbelt that final night...In any case, I highly recommend this film when it does come out on February 6th, I believe.  I'm sure you'll really enjoy it.  For those of you old enough to remember the event, it will bring back the thoughts and stirrings from those days long ago.  And even if you're not, you're still going to have a great evening of hockey and entertainment.",,Anonymous,History
Emotional,"This movie was wonderful, especially if you are old enough to remember the times surrounding the 1980 Olympics and the match vs. the Soviet Union specifically.  I found myself getting emotional early on in the movie since I knew the ending since it is a true story.  Kurt Russell did a superb job as Herb Brooks and it is unfortunate that Herb Brooks died last fall before the movie was completed.While the movie is great, there is one tragedy involved with the movie's production.  That tragedy is that the writer getting credit for the movie didn't actually write the screenplay that was used for the film.  Because of stupid, outdated Screenwriters Guild rules, the true writer, Mike Rich (who wrote Finding Forrester, The Rookie, Radio)isn't getting credit for the movie.  His story has been documented in THE OREGONIAN (Portland's main newspaper) and it is very unfortunate.  Mike should be very proud of this movie as it caught the characters, emotions and thrills of Feb. 22, 1980. One bit of good news about Mike is that Herb's wife, Patty, invited Mike to the unveiling of a Herb Brooks statue in St. Paul, MN last week and Mike spoke at the unveiling and then there was a showing of the movie and 12 of the 20 team members attended.  Herb's son actually wore plaid pants in his fathers memory.Great Movie, Great Job Mike Rich!!!!!!!",,Anonymous,History
