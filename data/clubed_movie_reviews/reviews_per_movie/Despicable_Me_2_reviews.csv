Delightful Family Entertaining,"The ex-villain Gru is raising his daughters Margo, Edith and Agnes and researching a legitimate jelly and jam business with Dr. Nefarion and the minions. Meanwhile, a laboratory in Arctic is stolen by a powerful aircraft using magnetism. The Anti-Villain league (AVL) agent Lucy Wilde recruits Gru to help her agency to discover who has stolen the laboratory and its research. They know that the thief has a store in a mall, and Gru suspects that the owner of the Mexican restaurant Salsa & Salsa, Eduardo Perez, may be the villain El Macho that is presumed dead in an accident.""Despicable Me 2"" is a delightful family entertaining. Who can resist to Gru, Agnes and the minions? And now, with Margo growing up and interested in boys and the clumsy but heartwarming Lucy Wilde, it is a great fun for the whole family. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Meu Malvado Favorito 2"" (""My Favorite Wicked 2"")",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Good animated fun!,"I went to see this film this morning and found it very enjoyable. I can't really remember the 1st so I can't really compare.Despicable Me 2 is a fast paced, funny, feel good film that keeps you entertained from the 1st minute to the last. The pace of the film moves along nicely and keeps the audience attention very well. It has many laugh out loud moments, a decent mix of children humour and adult humour.The main character Gru (voiced by Steve Carell)is likable and funny. The minions however are the main stars, they had me laughing on multiple occasions during the film. The language created for the minions is very well done as they speak in a fictional language but you can always gather what they are saying.I found the visuals very impressive, it was very colourful and very imaginative. The action scenes we also very well done.Would definitely recommend seeing this, no matter what your age. I am 22 and thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's not just for kids!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Not as good as the first film due to little in the way of plot, it's still worth seeing just to watch the minions.","I adored ""Despicable Me"" and my wife and I could never agree which we liked more--that film or the similarly themed ""Mega Mind"". We liked them both but she preferred ""Mega Mind"". Regardless, both films are excellent and entertaining for all ages. Because ""Despicable Me"" made a huge amount of money, it wasn't surprising that soon after they announced they were making a sequel. And, when the early teaser promos arrived in theaters, they stressed the minions and said nothing about the sort of story the sequel would be. This was, apparently, very prescient--as the film turned out to be exactly that--a film with a vague plot but which was worth seeing just for the antics of the minions. In fact, my wife decided to see ""Despicable Me 2"" simply because she heard me laughing many times at the minions.The film picks up pretty much right after the first one. Gru has adopted the three little girls and they, along with the minions and Dr. Lethario, are one big, happy family. However, trouble is brewing. Some super-villain has stolen a top secret formula that transforms nice creatures into killing machines--and a top secret international organization approaches the ex-villain, Gru, to help the locate the formula. They give him a spunky female sidekick and eventually romantic sparks fly. As far as the secret formula and the villain are concerned, this really seemed secondary to the romance and antics of the minions--and this plot seemed to wrap itself up quickly and easily.As I said, the plot, for what it is, is minimal and seems to be just an excuse to watch the minions as well as the romance. And, for me, this was enough to justify recommending the film. Clearly not as good as the original, but filled with fun nonetheless.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Loved It!!!,"In all honesty I can't remember the first film that well, so I found it hard to compare to the sequel. On the other hand this film is completely memorable and so enjoyable.I saw the preview and I absolutely loved it. I was worried that all the good bits were in the adverts but the film was full of exciting and hilarious parts that aren't in the advert.The minions are so funny, I was actually crying with laughter at some parts. In fact, I enjoyed it so much I am taking my little brother to see it again (mainly so I can see it again! Hehe)The characters are lovable, hate able, and hilarious, the film has evolved from the first one (from what I can remember) and its such a heart warming family film.I COMPLETELY Recommend THIS FILM :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
great movie for the whole family to enjoy,"Much funnier than the first one, Despicable Me 2 actually has me liking the second installation in a series much better than the original. A lot of sequels add in new characters. Some serve a purpose. Others not so much. This movie adds in new characters that are important. With funnier lines, funnier actions, and tons of minion madness, the movie has us focusing less on Gru's villainy, and more on the love life he never had.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Fantastic family fun, on par with the original","The first Despicable Me was a wonderful film, so while there is the worry of whether a sequel would work you can't help wanting to see it anyway. Despicable Me 2 was just as good as the first one, maybe not as fresh in terms of plot but what worked so well in the first works equally well here. The animation, also having the advantage of staying true to the style and look that the first had, is bursting with vibrancy and colour without looking too over-saturated as well as having a lot of detail to it. The retro-futuristic designs and gadgets are inventive and very striking to look at, while the music has rousing energy and is also memorable. Despicable Me 2 in the writing and gags is peppered with humour, and this is of the laugh-out-loud hilarious kind, though because there's a lot and that you may be laughing so hard you may be at a risk of missing something. To counter-balance the hilarity, the film also incorporates a message, it is a heartfelt one and doesn't feel cloying and out-of-place. For what the story may lack slightly in freshness in correlation with the first, it more than makes up for it in wit, heart, excitement and how briskly it moves without feeling rushed. Having more of the minions- one of the best assets of the first film- was a masterstroke also, and their subplot also gave the story an increasing sense of jeopardy and threat(though theirs is a little more interesting than that of world domination). Gru is a lovable character, whether a villain like in the first or not, and adds a lot of charisma and energy to the film. The top-notch vocal talents of Steve Carrell, Steve Coogan, Kristen Wiig, Benjamin Bratt and even Russell Brand are a further advantage. All in all, like the first Despicable Me this sequel is fantastic family fun and equal to it. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"It was okay, I guess","I was really looking forward to this film, but to be honest, it wasn't all that amusing. It made me smile a couple of times, but no real chuckles. The story was a little messy. Gru wasn't as convincing. Neither were his interactions with some of the new characters. Pure good doesn't suit him very well. The minions weren't as funny - in fact, they were a little annoying - and the villain's master plan was rubbish.The graphics were okay, but visibly low budget (compared to Pixar's Brave, for instance). It was as disappointing as one must expect from a sequel.If you don't have anything better to do and just want to be mildly entertained for 98 minutes, go for it. Otherwise, just re-watch the original Despicable Me, it was a lot better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Great Fun!,"So Despicable Me 2 is a very family funny/friendly animated comedy which at points really does make you laugh! If you are reading this now and haven't yet seen the trailer, I would recommend you don't watch the trailer and just go straight to the film, Some of the best parts are shown in the trailer. To watch this film you don't really need to have seen the first however I would recommend you do as at points the film refers to Despicable Me (1).I'm going to keep this review short and simply say, I gave this film a 9* rating as I found it strongly entertaining, not as funny as I thought but still a great film! The story line was also very easy to follow and keeps you engaged throughout.Would recommend this film to anyone! I would say most people will enjoy this film, find it entertaining and recommend it to there friends!This film is perfect for any family to view!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Not as good as the original,"The plot of the sequel was interesting, just like the first movie and I would definitely watch it, because I really liked the first movie. The storyline was well-written, kinda different than the first movie. The characters were kinda the same, very interesting, well-developed and likeable. Of course, the graphics and effects of the second movie were as good as the first movie. The opening scene was definitely unexpected and it was really funny. In my opinion, the villain of the second movie wasn't as interesting as, the one of the first movie. Overall, it was a nice and enjoyable movie that had some really funny scenes and epic battles. I have to admit that, the first movie was kinda better than the second movie. Last but not least, the ending scene was definitely unexpected. By they way, I'm gonna definitely watch the 3rd movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A disappointment,"Sigh!I don't get to watch too many movies, and even fewer on the big screen. So after watching Despicable Me (the original) numerous times at home - and loving it to death, this movie was a big disappointment for me and my daughters at the movie theater. It's been hard for me to put a finger on exactly what was missing, but I think it is mostly the lack of clever, witty dialog that filled the first movie. There are many fun moments in this movie, but they are predominantly sight-gags and one-liners. And sadly, the space between those moments was just not too intriguing. FYI, my girls (10 and 7) were also underwhelmed - though my younger one asked to get it on DVD or iPad, so she could replay the few parts she really liked.I thought this sequel had a lot of potential - especially in the Lucy character, but most of that potential was just squandered. The villain is portrayed with a very stereotyped and non-PC caricature, and unlike Vector (the villain from the first movie), didn't seem to have any motive. The evil plot was actually kind of scary instead of being funny, and the characters seem to spend a lot of time doing things that were just not that interesting and saying things that were just not that funny.All in all, a real let-down for our once-in-a-blue-moon trip to the movie theater.",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A Despicable sequel... In the best way!!,"As unphased as I am by the imminent departure of Louie Walsh from the X Factor, he did coin a memorable phrase during his tenure there.. 'The Likability Factor'. And that's what this movie has... Despite the by-the-numbers plot, and sometimes questionable attempts at humour, the relationship between former bad guy Gru and his three (whisper it) adorable daughters is real and affecting, just like in the first one.When a hardened cynic such as myself falls for the love between three adopted children and their new dad, you know it must be doing something right. Equally productive is the addition of a new love interest for Gru... A crazy redhead with a thing for gadgets and talking non-stop. Voiced by Kristen Wiig of Bridesmaids fame, she is a great addition to the franchise and you can tell her and you-know-who belong together.But let's face it... ALL the marketing for the movie is based around those little one-eyed yellow guys called Minions. They're as dumb as posts, speak utter gibberish and kids love 'em. I found them all rather hit and miss, sometimes their antics were cute and hilarious, on other occasions they were a real pain in the... neck. But at my screening whenever they arrived, there was an audible coo from the assembled TTF ( Tiny Tot Federation) so what do I know? Let the small fry have their fun...Overall, an impressive sequel that manages the impressive feat of being comparable to the original... But the question is, where do we go from here? The conclusion is pretty finite, but if this has made enough money... You can guarantee Hollywood will find someway of making a follow-up. After all, if there can be a sequel to Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs, ANYTHING is possible... 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Better than the original!,"It's not often that a hit animated film's sequel surpasses the original film. Despicable Me 2 is one of those rare cases. From the moment it appears on the screen to the end of the film, Despicable Me 2 is a fast paced, fun film that never ceases to be entertaining.This film has you laughing quite often, contains humour that both kids and adults can appreciate, and had at least one moment that was worthy of clapping out loud to.The character development is to be praised, as is the warmth and soul that Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud put into this film.This film leaves you feeling joyful and satisfied and happy for the characters and the new direction their lives are taking.This film is not to be missed and I can't recommend it enough.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Silly Fun (With A Little Emotion Thrown In),"The first ""Despicable Me"" effort introduced audiences to the goofy, rambunctious Minions as well as the relationship between villain-turned-good guy Gru and his three little girls. The second movie plays to those same strengths and offers more Minion mayhem and more heartfelt moments.For a basic plot summary, ""Despicable Me 2"" sees Gru (voice of Steve Carell) recruited by secret agent Lucy (Kristin Wiig) to join the newly-formed Anti-Villain league. Though at first nonplussed by the offer and content to be just ""Dad"" to Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier), and sweet little Agnes (Elsie Kate Fisher), Gru begins to feel the tug of adventure once again (as well as perhaps a bit of a romantic fling as well?!) and is quickly caught up in the world-saving game again.In terms of comedy and adventure, this movie provides it in spades! It's amazing that it took this many years of human history to think up such hilarious characters as Minions, as they can make even the most sourpuss among us crack a smile (and have most of us rolling in the aisles!). Their crazy antics are unrivaled in the history of animated feature films.There is also a nice little touch of emotion in the movie involving Gru finding a partner (or mother, as asked for by Agnes). I actually wish the movie would have focused on this movie, as a more developed and focused emotional aspect could have easily vaulted it to five-star status.Overall, though, ""Despicable Me 2"" is fine comedic fare for anyone who enjoyed the original. The girls might touch you, the Minions will have you laughing throughout, and Carell's Gru is such a crazy character that he is a joy to watch. A fun film for the entire family.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"When the world needed a hero, they called a villain.","I went to the cinema preview with my friend for this movie, and its even better than the first film! I only saw the first film recently, and I really liked it. I wasn't sure I wanted to go and see the film at first, but my mate wanted me to go and see the preview yesterday with him, and reluctantly, I said yes. Usually, the second films aren't better than the first, but boy was I wrong! I was laughing through out the whole film, and so was everyone in the audience, it was full to! Steve Carrell's character, Gru, was hilarious. I think everyone could agree though, the minions were the best characters in the film. My friend told me the directors made up a little language and did the voices, and I was very impressed, for you could hear a hint of English in every word they said.So, if you have seen the first film and liked it, don't hesitate to go and see it when it officially come out on the 28th June.

Jokes Over Substance,"The first Despicable Me was like a potential for a childhood favorite of the new generation by showing a memorable set of characters, and themes that contain a right amount of heart and sweetness. The existence of a sequel is obvious, by the way, there may be more things to explore in this villainous world. The charms and laughs return, but dealing with the story, it's cluttered with subplots that feels episodic and messy. However, many would still find it very entertaining and hilarious. Despicable Me 2 is okay, but its ambition needs to be more than their obsession with the minions.Just like the original, the film sets Gru to a simple mission, then he suddenly gets some distractions by his family building issues. But those certain distractions helps the film to be more than just a silly James Bond parody adventure and eventually gives a heartwarming message. We can accept this way of being more interested in the family stuff than the spy action, but now this sequel doesn't have much of the consistency from the first. There isn't much going on in the main plot, letting the subplots do most of the job. The subplots, as always, are tend to build a theme, but the story didn't dig enough to make all of that compelling. In the end, some twists are suddenly revealed and almost all of their problems are immediately solved.The voice performances still fill some life to these delightful characters. The best parts, without a doubt, are the minions, since they are the biggest reason why everyone wanted to see this. Their humor and antics are priceless and there is no single scene that you won't giggle. Here, they are a lot crazier than you would hope, because definitely that is what any kid or fan wants. The animation and action scenes are as lively as the comedy running around.Despicable Me 2 spares some good laughs, but it's still sort of disappointing. It indulges itself for focusing too much on the cute stuff. That's not bad, but the film quickly loses interest at the bigger picture. As much as it's terribly entertaining and funny, people will leave the theater lacking enough heart. The central plot is not energetic compared to the comedy, and the protagonist's distractions, which are supposed to create themes, are now plain distractions. Thinking aside, how worse could have been? To those who root for the characters(other than the minions) will somehow like it at least. A less bland blockbuster can be beneficial in this era. Still, the film would've been way better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A must see.,"This movie will honestly have you crying of laughter. It's as if this franchise will only continue to be better and better! With lots of lovely little twists and silly little gags Despicable me 2 will warm your heart and leave you smiling like silly! Definitely something to watch if you're upset, definitely will cheer you up.The movie has you smiling straight from the start with the cuteness and the willingness emitted from Gru when it comes to the kids.Despicable me 2 was absolutely worth the wait. With lots of highs and lows Gru has managed to prove to the audience that we should be able to put our faith in him, much like our common superhero movie Gru is put in difficult situations we question how he will get out of, but of course, he does.This is not just for children either, people ages 30 could easily be caught smiling at this heart-warming movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
40% more Minions a must go see!,"This was better than the 1st film which I saw and enjoyed. This is fast paced and funny because I laughed throughout. There are loads of potentially funny situations and they exploited them all instead of the disappointment of not taking things that little bit further. I'll be seeing it again and again as there is so much to catch the 2nd and 3rd time around too. The new characters, bad guy and gal spy, the spicy Latin flavor all enhance the storyline and enjoyment of the film. Minions are all throughout the film so if you wanted more you got more.

Average,"I don't understand how this is 7.8. I am a fair reviewer and this is at most a 6 by IMDb standards.It is well rendered, and there are some innovative parts, the characters which were excellently formed in the first one have now no consistency, the subplots clumsily come together, and no matter how many reviewers say this has adult and child appeal, it really is aimed at very young children.if I was to compare it in standard, you are looking at a Ice Age/Madagascar standard instead of the Kung Fu Panda/Toy Story 3 level.Worth a watch but 7.8 sounds a bit fishy to me",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"If you liked the first, you'll like this one!","Even more Despicable! Actually this is a sweet turn for the lovable anti-villain villain, Gru (voiced by Steve Carell), who is comfortably back as a bona fide family man, to the three adorable orphans who melted audiences hearts alike in the first film. Gru would seem like a fun father, but he takes his responsibilities overbearingly over the girls as he has trouble accepting them growing up. Not only that, but he struggles to find contentment with no longer being a villain, with his laboratory now transformed into a jam-making factory. Through expected plot development, advocated from a sequel, it is not until a love interest comes along, Lucy Wilde (voiced by Kristen Wiig), that Gru loosen his shell and the plot moves into action. She takes him to the aptly titled 'anti-villain league' who recruit Gru, with Lucy as his partner in anti-crime, to take down a new villain who has taken disguise at a local shopping mall. What better way to take down a villain than with a post-villain. However Gru is not as proficient as he used to be, he is divided and distracted between his responsibilities to his girls, his love for villainous antics and his mixed emotions to his new partner.The plot moves efficiently and effectively, moving briskly but taking special care with the characters whom audience enjoyed the first time around, while injecting a few new ones. Of course this means the minions are back, if ads didn't make it obvious. The uniformly dressed but motley shaped crew seem to have grown exponentially in number, as they are ever present in the film. Even their antics in the background over petty things, prove hilarious, but the pint size helpers also take a pivotal role in the plot. This strikes an interesting point in the films advertising. Hardly any plot was divulged, beyond set-up, meaning that there are plenty of surprises to be had in the film. In fact the minions took the foreground of marketing, being funny without substantiating into crass or being overtly annoying. Not only are they ingenious supporting characters but also act as an ingenious means of marketing the film, without spoiling much of the fun of the film, similarly like Scrat in the Ice Age films. If you only liked them in the first film, you'll love them now.The bottom line (hahaha 'bottom'- you read it in a minion voice didn't you :) is that this is a very comfortable flick. It lives up to the adage, if you liked the first you'll like this one. Colorful and cheerful animation, that is quite impressive, with more minion madness, as expected, punctuated by heart warming sentiment, in good measure.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Set A Villain To Catch A Villain,"After being nabbed in the original Despicable Me, Steve Carrell as Gru is given a kind of furlough from villainy and attempts to go straight with his kids. But a top secret laboratory is stolen from its Arctic site, I mean the whole building is just lifted from the ground with a giant magnet and transported to wherever. Those research facilities in the wrong hands could have a devastating impact on humankind so we set a villain to catch a villain.Kristen Wiig returns as Lucy, agent from the anti-villain league and truth be told she's enjoying the assignment though even because she brought Gru down in the first Despicable Me, she has a thing for him.As for Gru he suspects that supervillain El Macho whom he runs into in a mall hasn't retired from the villainy business. I really did like what Benjamin Bratt did with his character. Sounds like he was having a great old time with the part.Despicable Me 2 is a nice animated feature good for the whole family.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
One hundred percent Enjoyable!,"The sudden torrential showers had me thinking do I really have to go for the movie, but thank god I did! One and half hours of laughter made it worthwhile for braving the rain. From the word go, you start laughing and till the movie ends (and it gets only better during credits). There is no special intro to Gru this time but his 'Angel' costume really sets the tone. Agnes is cuter than ever and watching her run like the unicorn makes you smile (atmosphere gets better if you have kids in your theater, I had quite a few and makes you laugh when they imitate Agnes!). Margo is growing up and Edith is just the same. Gru is also looking out for a date all through the film, not knowing he has one right next to him, Lucy. She is the Agent from AVL (Anti Villain League) and her first job is the way she brings in Gru. (Lipstick taaaser!!!). And then there are the Minions. They actually are the focus of this film. You get a load of them throughout the film but you never notice. Every single one of their scenes make you laugh so hard that at one point I couldn't stop!!!(Minion Fire Brigade!!) And then there is El Macho and his son(and his chicken!) who give the twists in the end. You wont miss out Dr.Nefario who seems to leave Gru and plot the crime but helps save the world in the end.

LIGHTBULB! Not so bright. REVIEW with SPOILERS!,"Back in April I posted a reply on the boards indicating a sentiment of anticipation that I could not wait to see Despicable Me 2 having loved the first.I take my words back.It was enjoyable but I could have waited!Not as fresh, not as funny, not as simple or as visually fantastic or as big hearted as the first.Suffers a classic case of 'the sequel needs to be bigger' - which lays the way for busy visuals and too many subplots, in turn over complicating the story and cooling the focus of its heart.Is it fresh? No - what main plot of villainy there is, is boring. Although Gru and Agent Lucy Wilde's relationship is predictable it is handled efficiently enough that you hope boy gets girl and vice versa if only for Agnes' sake.It is funny? It's a mixed bag lacking the warmth of the first film, so the myriad of gags try harder in this (unsuccessfully) through added comedic violence. The main laughs are, for the most part, made up by antics of the Minions - these little yellow guys are no longer the side show to the wit of Gru and the delicious voice delivery of Steve Carell.Is it simple and visually fantastic? I'll say no - that's not to say the CG animation is not fantastic - it is as you would expect dazzling! But is it way too busy and that was the joy of the first.Is it big hearted? I think you can manage an answer from the observations above and your own feelings once you've seen it. I'll put it this way - it does try - but there is nothing in DM2 that comes close to Gru's bed time storytelling.The story arc of 'family' is now complete for Gru and the girls - moving forward I hope Despicable Me 3 is a prequel - of a time when Gru, Dr Nefario and the Minions were still up to no good.6.5/10I didn't mean to call you a meat loaf, Jack !",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Every You Would Want In A Family Film,","Despicable Me 2 is a brilliant film with a great storyline and an impressive voice cast.I definitely wouldn't say it was better than the first Despicable Me,the first one was a lot more heartwarming,but it still is a very good sequel and has everything you want in a family film,humor for both young and older audiences.However,the story of the movie feels very scattered and throughout I felt like they were trying to fit too much in one hour and a half.Like the first Despicable Me,the Minions are the best part,and they get even more screen time in this one that they did previously,it's almost impossible not to laugh at these goofy and lovable characters.It's not as good as the first Despicable Me,but this sequel is very funny and an enjoyable movie for the whole family and I look forward to seeing what Illumination Entertainment does with these characters in the future.Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) joins the Anti-Villain League in order to find an anonymous villain working on an experiment to turn the world evil.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
So-so sequel,"Like many sequels, this one falls short of the original. The first movie is set apart by its originality, and the transformation of the arch-villain Gru into a soft-hearted father.This time around, Gru and the kids are already settled, and he's retired from villlainy. The only thing to do is bring him out of ""retirement"" to do battle with yet another villain, who wants to take over the world (don't they all?).Throughout the movie, minions abound, providing comic relief (in a comedy).But most of the action is only a little more than ordinary. Some sight gags work well, but not enough to make this sequel stand out. some scenes just run too long - the Cinco de Mayo party, for one.There's a possibility of a third movie, and with a partner for Gru, the stage is set for something completely different.

Fell Short of the Goal,"This movie might be worth the rental and then it is just something to toss at your kids about 6 to 8 years old. The first movie was hit with both young and old but this movie is just cliché filled with tropes and idioms. Unlike the first story this one lacks humor.The writers completely lose sight of the good characters from the first movie such as; Vector, Dr. Nefario, and even Gru's Mom. They bring in a new villain who leaves a dry taste in your mouth. The only thing original and funny about him was his premature demise. Instead the comedy falls on the shoulders of his minions.

'Meh' at best,"I'm slightly confused as to why this ranked number one in the box office. It's an OK movie, but it's not great enough to beat movies that should have claimed number one, such as Pacific Rim.The movie itself has many good intentions, but it focuses too much on the minions rather than around Gru's life with his daughters, and bonding with them. Sure, it pans to the fans' obsession with these yellow Minions, but for those who aren't in love with them, it can lead to a mediocre experience.I've watched it four times. The first two were with other friends, and the other two were alone in the audience. I can't say it's a movie that you should watch alone, because you won't be laughing as hard as in a crowd. The movie starts off great, but after Lucy shows up, the act with the Minions has me a bit unfocused. The skit there is drawn out too long, and even the scenes after that don't keep me on the edge of my seat.The scenes at the mall brought a chuckle at the most from me, but overall, pelvic thrusting from Gru made me feel awkward surrounded by parents who may think that it's inappropriate for their children to be watching. And it sort of is. It's embarrassing.It just gets more and more drawn out, and I really wanted to leave the movie at the halfway point (at the fourth time watching it), because I know I'm not going to get any pleasure watching the rest of it.I do watch movies repeatedly, over and over, but I won't be seeing this movie again. I won't say that I was ever a major nerd for Despicable Me, so maybe that's why my review isn't ecstatic over this movie. I don't feel it earned its place as number one convincingly enough, but hopefully it will be the last of this Despicable Me series.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

A marginally adequate brain-off entertainment,"This animation is about the super villain Gru, who is recruited to fight another villain's plot to take over the world.""Despicable Me 2"" has very cute characters doing silly things, which is fun to watch at times. The minions are so silly that they got me chuckling many times. However, the charm of the film ends there. Maybe I am not the right age or the right demographic, but I find ""Despicable Me 2"" just a little to silly. It is a simple hero versus villain film, with very little to engage the adult viewers. The emotional subplot the search for a mother is just too thin to make any emotional impact.In recent years, animations are so good that viewers are completely spoilt. We expect a visually appealing film with fun, jokes and emotional subplots, plus an obligatory moral lesson. ""Despicable Me 2"" might have been a good film fifteen years ago, but it is only a marginally adequate brain-off entertainment for the high standards nowadays.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The Despicable Me franchise lands its second outing on both light-weight feet.,"The Despicable Me franchise may not be necessarily better than Disney, Pixar or Dreamworks, but it certainly has a breezy quality to it that's refreshing to see. I really enjoyed the first film for light entertainment. While it has the standard something-for-kids and something-for- adults, its charm comes from really not taking itself seriously as it could almost be an update of the absurd Looney Toons cartoons but still having a small gut punch of emotion. The first film hit with the bonding of the three girls and Gru, this film is about the one gap left in their unconventional family - the mother and wife. This new addition, Lucy, unfortunately feels more like the grating Kristen Schaal than the frequently endearing Kristen Wiig. They force the quirkiness on her character and it's incredibly irritating. As much as I want to see Gru find a partner and the girls find a mother figure, the way they had everyone, even minion, adore her unconditionally backfired entirely. However, she doesn't drag the film down that much. Everything else is on top form, perhaps even better than the first film. While it's nice to have such an unlikely likable and resourceful protagonist in Gru, the series does seem to suffer from its lack of antagonist forces as the film glides through the narrative with ease. But then, this isn't supposed to be heavyweight stuff like Pixar.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
One of the funniest movies I've ever seen,"***NOTE*** I only check-marked this because I say one joke from the movie. Other than that, this review is spoiler-free.When I saw the first Despicable Me movie, I liked it a lot, but I was expecting a really funny movie with serious moments in there. I personally believe the first one is a film that has a first priority to make you care rather than just go for laughs the whole time. It does that, and has a few funny moments. I felt that the sequel would be similar in that aspect, but I was wrong about that. This film is loaded with funny moments. You saw some of it in the trailer, but I still expected the movie to be like the first. I'm glad I was wrong though, because the more funny moments in this film really gives us something new and unique about it. This was the big comedy I was expecting with the first film. There are so many humorous moments in this, you'd lose track easily. I think the joke that made me laugh the most was at the beginning of the film when Agnes is having a medieval-themed birthday party. The minions are playing along and one of them keeps hitting the wrong thing, and all the other minions just attack him. That was just awesome. Speaking of them, I love how creative they've become. There's so many great jokes with them, it's hard not to enjoy them.As for the characters, all your favorites from the first are back, plus they introduce a few new ones, like Lucy, and the villain. I'm not going to say who the villain is, or what he does, but I will say that his build-up in the movie is really clever. He kidnaps most of the minions, but you don't see his face, or even any of his body. It's not revealed who the villain is until around the end of the movie. I think that's really clever, but I don't think the villain is very threatening, or even funny.I'm also not a fan of Lucy. She always seems to be in a laid-back mood. There's one scene where she's strapped to a rocket, and she's not even acting like she's freaking out. Why is she happy about everything? I can understand that they're trying to make her a fun character, but I think she was overdone.Another thing I like about this movie, however, is that when I was watching the trailers for it, I felt this may just be Gru trying to stop a bad guy. For the most part, it is, but there's another story going on (I know I check-marked spoilers, but I'm not saying it) that is balanced very well into this movie. It's more than just Gru trying to save the world.I personally liked this movie better than the first one, although that one was good too. I may even put this as one of my favorite comedies. Go see it when you have the chance.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"Good film, but inferior to the previous installment","I had the chance to watch both the first and second film on a flight from Seoul to Singapore. The first one came out in 2010 and I was busy doing my national service hence I never had the chance to watch it. The first one was a pleasant surprise and I loved the idea of focus on a bad guy turning good of sorts. The second installment tried to expand on the story and foundation based on the first one. It worked alright, but it was predictable at times. Also, I always felt that the minions steel the thunder from Gru. It could have been better if the bond between Gru and his adopted daughters were explored further. In the end it's natural movie goers will get a spin off of the minion movie. It's a fun movie to watch with a child, but there is was no two times the charm.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

A fine sequel but not as charming as the predecessor.,"A fine sequel but not as charming as the predecessor.Many sequels get lost or get rotten by showing the same thing over again in a new package. The packaging is different but the contents are more or less the same. This film too, follows a similar path just that it deviates to introduce more themes or plots. Like, the sub plot of Gru (played by Steve Carell) and his girlfriend Lucy (played by Kristen Wiig).The villain is new, the gags are new and the action is also new, yet the soul remains unperturbed or changed. So that's a bit of disappointment if you expect something radically different in this. If you loved the earlier one indeed there are higher chances that this one shall also be loved. I am saying this, as actually there are more moments of laughter and fun.The minions, who had a lesser role in the prequel play a big role in holding the film together and helping the hero achieve to win over the villain. I ain't gonna reveal anything more than this, concerned to the plot. Of course, the kids who were there in the earlier film are part of this too.I like it but not to an extent as I liked the first one. Yet, it's watchable and hilarious too. I am going with a 3/5. Yes, it's surely a well done animated film. But for me, I got a feeling of been there and seen that.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Really Bad.....(which made us sad),"Okay, I have children so we ran out anxiously to see Gru and co.,after watching previews for a year. I have to say that we are huge fans of the first movie so it pains me to give the following review.The movie was a bore. Sadly, the previews that we watched for a long time that made us want to see the movie ironically turned out to be the movie! There was such a lack of story that it amazed even my children. Gru was not a kindhearted villain anymore and his character lacked any depth. Even the villain was not characterized well. The first half- hour(at least) was exactly the previews(in order). The rest of the movie failed to develop and left us wishing that we had saved money and saw this sequel on DVD. Very disappointing!

The formula didn't really work this time!,"As I write this Despicable Me 2 sits with a score of 8.1 on IMDb, an unnaturally high score in my opinion due to the 'recency effect' surrounding the hype and excitement surrounding its release. I saw the first screening today in my local cinema and took the opportunity to see it in 3D. I loved the first movie, it was an amazing movie with a big heart that worked both for kids and adults alike. I think the makers sat and made a list of all the things people liked from the first movie and the list probably looked something like this...1. Minions- lets have more minions. 2. Agnes- more shouting, he's so fluffy, or words to that effect. 3. Gru's stubborn resistance to opening up his heart. Already for the kids so how do we fit that part of the formula in? 4. Gru's moment of resolve when nothing can stop him.The problem as with many animated movies is that the storyline was incredibly weak, yes all those things listed were cute but the first movies greatness came off the back of a great storyline. The storyline in this movie was so thin that I found myself having spells of 10 minutes or so throughout the film where I was completely disengaged. Lets also not forget how great the soundtrack was for the first movie and there was no real attempt to better or even match that, in fact they used much of the same soundtrack from Pharrell Williams. Sure there were occasional nice moments throughout because the characters are great but I'm disappointed that they didn't continue the franchise with a equally strong storyline. I predict that the score for DM2 will level off to about 6.5 and on the strength of this movie I'll happily watch DM3 but I won't be rushing to the cinema to see it. As I was leaving I caught a guy saying that the best thing about the movie was the 3D bubbles that came out the screen during the credits. I suspect the gimmicks will be remembered long after the plot which was instantly forgettable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Still despicable,"The first Despicable movie was better, no doubt about it. But this still is a funny continuation of the story.

Charming and enjoyable fun,"In 2010, 'Despicable Me' was a surprise hit – it was not a sequel and came from a studio who had never had a huge success in the era of Pixar; but it was an enjoyable comedy that went on to gross nearly half a billion dollars worldwide, thus making a follow-up all but inevitable.'Despicable Me 2' finds former supervillain Gru (wonderfully voiced by Steve Carrell) in much less evil form, blissfully living with his three adopted orphans (and the minions), hosting birthday parties, sweetly dressing up as a fairy princess and making cupcakes and jellies. However, this idyllic life is interrupted by Anti-Villain League agent Lucy (Kristen Wiig) who is partnered up with Gru to take down a nefarious villain.Despite some good gags involving Gru, the real stars of the show are the little yellow Minions. They're given significantly more screen time here than in the original, but thankfully it rarely feels like overkill, instead they're a reliable source of laughter whenever they are on screen, whether chopping through a wall, singing a lullaby in gibberish talk or saying ""bottom"" with a snigger. On the other hand, Kristen Wiig is given a relatively underwritten role and most of her jokes fall flat, despite some good voice acting.One of the flaws of 'Despicable Me 2' is how unfocused it is – the big villain behind it all barely gets a look-in, while the plot is muddled and slightly unengaging, but overall, this was easily forgivable, simply due to the charming nature of the movie. It's not earth-shattering and arguably not as good as its predecessor, but this sequel is consistently enjoyable, always managing to put a smile on my face and causing viewers young and old to erupt with laughter.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

The jokes just kept coming, and they stayed funny, which is rather rare for a sequel.

Good use of the minions make it work even if it is uneven and plot not particularly engaging,"The key thing for me about this film is that the plot really didn't stick in my head. I don't mean the easy summary that Gru is employed to help locate and takedown another super villain suspected to be working out of a local mall, but rather that the detail of it didn't leave a mark. It isn't that I needed an animated kids film to have a really gripping narrative, but here it is a bit meh in its content and pacing. This is where it is weak but generally it manages to shore the film up all around the plot by adding constant cute and funny bits at every turn.As with the first film, the film is at its best when it gives a throwaway moment to Agnes or, more frequently, it lets a minion fall off something. This it does a lot and it is never not funny but at times it does start to feel a little like the film is overusing them and hurting the main characters by comparison. Gru is less interesting and often just feels like a plot device to make a story so that the film can mess around within that frame and this goes for many of the human characters. It does still work though but, while the film is loaded with voices from Carrell, Wiig, Schaal and many others, it really tends to play to its short yellow strengths instead.It is still funny, but the minions should be the cherry on top – not the whole show.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Sitcom-y but endearing in the best of ways,"Three years ago, Despicable Me launched Illumination Entertainment and announced Universal Studios as a viable player in the animation game (only Disney/Pixar and DreamWorks used to show up to these box-office battles). The film wasn't even the only supervillain animation to hit the theaters that year, but it did one-up its rival Megamind both in critical acclaim and commercial success.Now, the original film's creative team returns with Despicable Me 2, continuing the adventures of former supervillain-cum-adopted father Gru, his precocious daughters Margo, Edith, and Agnes, and his little, yellow, nonsense-spouting minions. Following closely on the first film's heels (this film gratifyingly puts a premium on continuity), the now-retired Gru is settling into his new paternal role, and while the spikier parts of his personality remain, he's reshaped himself into an adoring father and potential purveyor of jams (and jellies). When an evil plot threatens the globe, however, Gru finds himself pulled back into the supervillain game by the Anti-Villain League, who've recruited him to be the hero, an ersatz spy who knows how the mystery bad guy thinks. One earnest and delightfully overbearing partner introduction later, the pair (Gru and newbie AVL agent Lucy Wilde, played by Kristen Wiig) are undercover as bakers in a strip mall where the bad guy's scheme is likely to go down.Despite the world being threatened, the stakes feel surprisingly low in the film; the archness of the plot never feels as real or immediate as the character interactions, which are enjoyable all the way through. Here, Gru realizes his loneliness, his neophyte partner realizes her true calling, and his daughters come to grips with new realizations and wishes. The characters take center stage, rarely letting the transparently-raised stakes of the plot machinations get in the way of sitcom-like character arcs such as the eldest daughter dating (and Gru's dogged insistence on undermining it) or little Agnes wanting a new mother. But that's sort of the magic of these films; despite the plot beats being the stuff of basic sitcoms, the setting and characters manage to still make the film a winning combination.Steve Carell dusts off the strange Eastern European accent he originated for Gru, and manages to be both an amusing character and his own straight man. Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier, and Elsie Fisher embody adorableness as the girls. But it's Wiig who steals the show as Agent Wilde, a professional woman who is also goofy and personable. Wiig and Carell have fantastic chemistry, even with just their voices in play.The minions, those little yellow blobs in overalls that accompany all of the film's publicity, are back and hilarious as ever, despite their laser-like focus on slapstick and complete lack of intelligible dialogue. The Despicable films seem to be two separate animation genres welded together: the first is a heartfelt, Pixarian meditation on the nature of family, but the second is the part with the minions, which embody the anarchic spirit of the Looney Tunes more successfully than any of their predecessors. It's a strange melange that shouldn't work, but dammit, it does, and the resulting films wound up being both moving and guffaw-inducing.The other aspect of the Despicable films that bowls me over is the virtual cinematography; truly, alongside the best of Pixar's output (like Wall-E), these are some of the most beautiful animated films ever made. The use of color, depth, and art are stunning, from Gru's Charles Addams-inspired design to the beautiful play of light, shadow, and color. This sequel follows the high standards of the first, and the result is a feast for the eyes.The bottom line is that like the first film, this one is a trifle, but a very enjoyable one. It's little more than a victory lap for Carell and company, but when there are characters you can enjoy this much, what's wrong with spending another couple of hours with them?",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

They are funny every time that they're on the screen. They are just the silliest and the most adorable. Gru has an interesting family story where the girls especially Agnes wants a mother figure. The oldest girl Margo is infatuated with a boy. And Gru could be falling for Lucy. It makes for a good compelling personal story. And did I mention the Minions?

Just as fresh as the original one! cant recommend enough,"Despicable me 2 This is probably the first time when a animated series' sequel has surpassed the excellence of the original movie. It was fairly unique as instead of the typical good guy as the main character, they put up a villain as the protagonist (although he ended up good) which made it more refreshing and more fun to watch. Aside from his pointy nose and hilarious accent, we were also invited to spend some time with the extremely adorable and mischievous yellow Minions, who speak almost entirely incomprehensibly in their own unique language. This time around, Gru's no longer a villain. The comedy here works too. The jokes are humorous and most of them work for all ages. Some of them may not be original or repetitive, but they're still able to give you a laugh. And it doesn't hurt that an incredible cast was behind the delivery of the jokes here. Steve Carell was charming as usual and he never fails to impress with his excellent voice portrayal of Gru. The rest of the cast was superb too. I for one,Liked the visual effects in this more than I did of Life of Pi. The sets were also very vibrant and colorful. They're so wonderful that they make the film come to life. Everything is splendid about the setting. They're also very detailed and it's just a treat for the eyes. The animation too is just eye- popping. All the characters' movements are extremely detailed and very smooth. The 3D is more of an optional choice though, but some scenes are especially tailored for 3D as they literally pop out of the screen, especially the end credits. Don't miss that one.High points- Animation, dialogues and end credit Lows- a bit scary for lil ones Verdict- Just as fresh as the original one. I cant recommend enough!  7 on 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Comedy Genre at its best!!!,"DM2 is definitely a competitive movie to its prequel,you may not find the stealing of moon this time though. Except the plot,sequel is way better than its prequel especially in terms of comedy. Steve Carell has outdone himself really. There is more importance to Elsie Kate Fisher(Agnes) here as the directors know well what we'd like to see. I bet you cannot find any other animation films this much funnier. Both the directors are the smartest ever i've seen. Budget is low as movie already soars in Box office. They knew exactly what to do to make the Box office come their way. Yep,I am talking about the minions. When I watched the prequel I never thought they were making a sequel giving more value to minions. But they found a way. That was spot on! What I still wonder is whatever they tried to give us a comedy,it never failed anytime. That is never easy. Great stuff! May be here, we need Tom Hanks' voice to get a lot of votes for this wonderful movie. Come on! All go see this. Don't waste your life by being miss this funniest flick. When it comes to music, Happy song is just amazing. Its safe to say that background music is brilliant as always. Minions at its best during the climax. Final words: This is surely one of the greatest animation movies of the century. Just spend your bucks to encourage both the directors to make another splendid movie. Of course,we can anticipate more from them as Sandra Bullock (Richest Paid Actress) is pulled for their next one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A fun ride_ not great but entertaining,"The first part was about Gru, a rather unsuccessful villain, who cultivates himself into a loving father in the course of the film. In the second part there are all those elements that made the first part such a good film. But now these elements are weighted differently. There is one rule: More Minions at any price. That means there are only a few allusions to other films (For example, the homage to Star Wars Episode 2), the story is less exciting and Gru is not that substantial, but the Minions get more space to unfold.The story of Gru and his children is no longer as interesting and touching, not so strong too, but who bothers. Actually the story of Gru and his children was indeed told in the first part. Although this also means that the story of ""Despicable 2 ¨ is not as exciting, but this film was incredibly funny.The best thing is that the minions work wonderfully as role models. This may be because that they are presented as minimalist as it could have been. All information has been conveyed by gestures and facial expressions. Simultaneously, the Minions are very easy knit and behave like children. This is always something going on, we forgive them every stupidity, and it includes these little creatures straight to his heart. ""Despicable Me 2 "" is considered a work of evolution , if you really want to give a correct term to the film, as it is a sort of next step in the first film, which was , however, already important issues such as parental responsibility and the problem of children orphans.Themes like love, the desire to build a family and friendship are treated with a certain maturity, thanks to the valuable work of the writers Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio.The graphics and animations are one of the strong elements of the film and it is a true pleasure for the eyes. Somehow even the music manages to carve out as a living in the movie.In terms of the narrative, the film is beautiful and engaging, in some respects even exciting, great to spend an evening in total relaxation.From the beginning until the final sequences are witnessing a great ""show"" that manages to entertain the paying public in an efficient manner , but this is still a feature of the new generation of cartoon in which the U.S. we are accustomed in recent years .""Despicable Me 2"" is further proof that the U.S. animated family film works quite well , and it is an industry that still manages to dazzle the viewer with fantastic stories and lovable characters.(7.4 / 10)",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Mediocre in every sense,"There is nothing much to say except that this movie which is now the 2nd biggest blockbuster of the year is plain. I guess we are in the Twilight age when mindless, depth lacking films are blockbusters and beloved by the drone masses while great films are never given their just dues and forgotten. As the Twilight saga proved, intelligence and substance is dead.Now for this movie. Animation sucks, poorly done CG and very off looking. It is so obviously poor quality but since that is what the public is used to, of course it is beloved.Story is childish. This film is JUST for kids and a few really really kiddish adults. Heck i watch loads of animated films and consider myself a kid at heart but then again the animations i like actually have depth and emotion and story and most of all SUBSTANCE! This film lacks it all. No story (fit for small kids), no substance which actually was there in the first one, no emotions and no depth. In fact it is so bland, i am in shock at how far public tastes have fallen to make this a hit. Some dumb-ass i saw wrote how very Pixar and adult this film is. Intelligence and substance is falling way too quickly in our society as proved by this person. Apparently substance-less, beyond childish drivel with a few minor references to movies is considered a coup in film making. Wit, intelligence, emotionally driven stories that actually have a message and soul are a taboo in society these days.Character development is near 0. And the minions silliness drives this film. Perfect for people who hate thinking or who are shallow and these people number in the millions as the twilight saga has just proved.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"A lot of fun, but Despicable Me 2 is no where near as good as the original","My hopes were high for the sequel to the hilarious family film Despicable Me. However, they were not matched.Despicable Me 2 has wonderful, vibrant, colourful animation, and the minions still keep is laughing but other then that, there really isn't anything memorable here. The story is weak. The humor is mainly aimed at little children, which is not necessarily a bad thing and it ends all too suddenly. Also, the love story between Gru and the special agent (Chill, i really haven't spoiled anything) feels forced.All in all, Despicable Me 2 is an enjoyable Family film, but a poor sequel to the wonderful original Despicable Me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
despicable me 2 review,I was waiting for this movie a while before it came out. The very night it came out I saw it in the Theaters. Its a excellent movie I give it a 9/10 it was better then the first despicable me. You have got great actors You got Steve Carrel playing Gru You got Benjamin Bratt playing the new villain El Macho witch in my opinion is better then Vector in the first movie and You also have Kristen Wigg playing Lucy. It also has quite a bit of comedy in it I had a few good laughs and I hope You will to. The minions are very cute and they did a good job on making the looks on the characters. This movie did good in the box office it made 338 million for domestic total gross and that's good thanks for checking my review guys ill see you later!,9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Despicable Me 2 was an okay sequel to its previously okay predecessor,"I remember partly enjoying the first Despicable Me movie. My problem with that one, though, was that I thought it was too cutesy to make the satire effective enough for me. With this version, I sorta expected the cuteness, especially with all those minions, so I wasn't as disappointed as I partly was with the first one. In this one, Gru is recruited to help the anti-villain league with outing a former villain in a mall. An agent named Lucy (voice of Kristen Wiig) is picked as his partner. Oh, and his kids are trying to play matchmaker for him. I'll stop there and just say that while I did enjoy this sequel, I didn't find myself thinking it was hilariously funny. But I was amused enough with what I saw so on that note, Despicable Me 2 is worth a look if you like this sort of thing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
What would Gru be without his Mignons...Mignons FTW!!,"They are back, even when I did not know how much I missed them. The sequel of ""Despicable Me"" was none of my most anticipated movies of this year. Neither has the original movie been the big milestone of animated movies. Still the story around the super villain Gru, three little orphans and above all the little yellow helping fellers, his mignons, was entertaining and had some unforgettable scenes. I just say ""fluffy"". Now the creators had a hard job to do. Gru became a ""nice"" father, ended his evil career and became business man. Ordinary problems like annoying neighbors and hyperactive kids can only be managed with his army of clumsy yellow guys. But his past reputation gets Gru a job at the AntiVillainLeague, where his know-how should be used to catch another bad guy. The story beginsWithout spoiling anything, because I guess everybody knows that Gru will succeed, this sequel shows how it is done! Creators really listened to the fans and did a remarkable job. They took everything what was great in the original movie, what had the highest potential and bundled it together to create a hilarious and enjoyable sequel, bigger and richer in variety, similar to the step ""Shrek""/""Shrek 2"". More of big eyed Agnes and much much more of mignons are the main pillars which prop the new adventure of Gru as Secret Agent. What is more, new characters like Mr. RamsBOTTOM and crazy Lucy, Grus big fan and more than just a helping hand, enrich this story tremendously.To sum up, ""Despicable Me 2"" shows in special graphic style how movie ideas should be developed and how entertainment potential can be used effectively. With more screen time, the mignons may finally live up to the importance they deserve and I would not be shocked, if a mignon-spin off would follow. In short, great fun for every age!",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Meh, about what you get with sequel","Much like Cars 2, Despicable Me 2 relies too heavily on secondary characters meant to be the comedic leavening to the main protagonists the first time out. Much like Mater gets nauseating in large doses, the minions (or allergy pills with eyes) get to be more annoying than cute when brought to the fore. This main issue rises from generally flat writing that attempts to stick too closely to tropes presented in the first installment rather than trying to break new ground. In fact, the only real laugh comes from Agnes asking Gru dressed as a fairy princess why a fairy princess would be fat and he responds: ""because I live in a house made of candy and I eat instead of facing my problems."" Beyond that most of the humor comes from minions doing slapstick which just isn't that funny unless you are six years old. The voice talent does an admirable job lead by Steve Carrell doing his non-specific Eastern European accent. Unfortunately, we never hear from Gru's mother whose complicated relationship with her son drove a lot of the interest for adults in the first one. In short, watch the first one again instead.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Best film of the franchise, hands down!","This is where the series should have ended with Despicable Me 2. Like the first movie, it has more humor and jokes that keeps the audience entertained. When I saw this for the first time back in 2013, I have no idea what was going through my head. I recently thought it wasn't as good as the original, but after five months of thinking about it, I got the movie on DVD on Christmas and I watched it a lot ever since. Despicable Me 2 picks up one year after the events of the first movie, Gru is now a father and an jam businessman. While trying to live a happy life with the three adorable girls, he meets secret agent named Lucy, who works for the Anti-Villain League. Along the way, Gru discovered a man named Eduardo Perez, which he believes Eduardo is El Macho who stole the PX-41 serum in Russia, but nobody believed him. As the film progresses, it was revealed that Eduardo was really El Macho all along. In my opinion, El Macho was the best villain of the series alongside Vector. In the tempt to stop El Macho, Gru must decide what side he is on: will he save the people he loved or will he go back to his villainous ways? The choice is his... Despicable Me 2 will go down as one of the best sequels of animation. The characters were spot-on like Agnes, Margo, Lucy, Edith, Dr. Nefario, Antonio, the Minions and others. The only character that I don't like is Jillian because she tricked Gru into dating Shannon, which ended up being the worst date ever. Anyways, Despicable Me 2 is the best film of the franchise with the bittersweet ending that will leave the audience in tears of joy.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Lacks it's originality, but undeniably cute","Honestly there's nothing new that 'Despicable Me 2' offers especially in storyline. It's more about Gru a-changed-man (after being villain at the first movie) is recruited by an institution to undercover and reveal a crime. He is accompanied by Lucy, his new partner and of course the minions to find out who's the bad guy and what's he planning.A spy thing and fighting against bad guy has already been common these days. Besides the studio make the same formula like in any those movies and most of times are predictable. The conclusion for massive conflict is also very simple that makes audience exhausted and would feel they're watching a repeatable movies. Gru's character who become a hero this time is boring, I still prefer to see a bad Gru which is quite impossible. Luckily, they have cute characters (Minions and Agnes) that audience wouldn't mind to see it although having poor storyline. Just seeing Minions move, walk or talk would make people at least smile. Minions have more portions in this movie which is reasonable and not surprising. If it wasn't Minions character, 'Despicable Me 2' would be so horrible and disappointed. Overall, 'Despicable Me 2' is just an ordinary animation movie but still enjoyable to watch. What makes it special because of the cuteness of Minions and Agnes that save the entire film. Just bring kids watching these, they're definitely gonna love it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Simple and good but expected a little more,"Once again I am not convinced. 'Despicable Me' movie from the series is yet to impress me. Like the first, it was not that good but okayish. The only great advantage of the story was having minions around. As usual the minion's jokes were very good, even in the end credit we're entertained thoroughly. It is unimaginable, 'Despicable Me' without minions.Whatever the movie is, there's no stopping for the Steve Carell role, I mean he as a dubbing artist to the Gru. The story continues after ex- super villain Gru gave up his stealing business to take care of his adopted children. Now he's a trying to be a good care taking father and making jelly for a living. But looks like the past won't let him as a new person. The officials recruit him to catch the new villain on the loose who is a great threat. And the rest of the story tells how they gonna stop the dangerous villain from being executed his masterplan.The story was okay. The problem was the villain, he was too weak. The movie never lets him show his true power in any portion of the tale. I thought many scenes in the movie were wasted for nothing.

Sill a great movie!,"""Despicable Me"" was a big summer hit grossing a surprising number 251.5 million dollars on the box office. It was ranked tenth on the all-time animation movie chart. Three years later, the sequel released wishing to make a blockbuster as great as the first movie.In the first movie, Gru, a super-villain, planned to steal the moon by adopting three girls for his personal benefit. Slowly, these kids changed his heart. As a result, Gru turns from ""superbad"" to ""superdad"".This sequel begins with Gru who has quit being a bad guy is invited to help the anti-villain league. Gru and his partner, Lucy are searching for the top secret formula which makes a cute, fluffy animal turns into a purple, savage monster. Through the cooperation, Gru and Lucy made an unexpected chemistry reaction, but when he saw his eldest daughter, Margot hanging out with another boy, he opposed like every father does.This sequel comparing to 2010's ""Despicable Me"" is nearly as entertaining as the original, although it may not be as fresh, it still brings big laughs in this sequel. For example, after the first movie successfully caught the audience with the colorful vision and the charming characters (especially those cute, yellow minions), the appearances of ""Gru's cousins"" increased. The minions were a highlight since the first movie. This time, minions are everywhere! They sing, they dance, they make fun with each other, but most important of all, they sure make the audience enjoy the 98-minute movie.There is a big difference contrasting to the original. The first movie shows the father-daughter love which makes us feel warm and cozy, this time, ""Despicable Me 2"" adds some romance into it. For example, the ""Gru-and-Lucy"" love and the little crush between Margot and Antonio. These all make the plot more interesting.""Despicable Me"" is my favorite animated movie ahead of ""Wreck-it Ralph"" placed in second. Although the plot of ""Despicable Me 2"" is not as great as the first one. It is hilarious, adorable and enjoyable. In 2014, the minions will have their very own movie. Though we might not understand their language through the entire movie, I am still looking forward to that movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

However it gets tiresome quickly, even my 5 year old was getting bored by the end of the movie.I love good animated movies especially when me and my daughter both find them entertaining, that's really a mark of a good movie when it can reach adults and children alike.Despicable Me 2 never really took off, and was a total dud for me (and my kid)",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Better than the first version,"I watched Despicable Me only to understand what was the deal with the Minion memes. Although I did understand what it was all about, I decided to take a look at the sequel also, since I found so many things to like in that movie, especially the characters and the comic timing. And I'm really glad I decided to make that decision. Despicable Me 2 is, in every way, better than the first movie. Although I don't really like animated movies which don't hold much value other than giving the laughs, this movie is actually much better than most such movies.The thing I really like about Despicable Me 2 is that it is able to expand over the story that the prequel did. Normally in animated movies that are just made for the laughs, the sequels don't work so hard to make the story. They just bring back the villain, and bring in more explosions. There are also characters who are suddenly pulled out of nowhere, which isn't something that happens over here. This movie knows it's just made for the laughs, yet it takes the effort of making it more complicated than it needs to be.Dr Nefarious retires in this movie. I really liked him. He seemed to be something like a grandfather to all the Minions. I still remember the scene where the Minions are working and one of them wears a fruit dress and dances singing something like ""Eto hola macarena kala kala macarena"" (I don't know what it was, but it was so memorable). Then there's the scene where Gru is invited to the secret agency.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Exceeds The Original,"Gru (Steve Carell) is recruited by the Anti-Villain League to help deal with a powerful new super criminal.Opinion is mixed on whether the first or second is the better film, and this is ultimately a personal and subjective decision. For me, however, the second is better than the first and it is easy to explain why: the shift from the kids to the minions as the secondary characters. Some people prefer the kids, while others (myself included) prefer the minions.In 2013, the strongest animated film is certainly ""Frozen"" and that will likely be the film to take home the Oscar (just as they snagged the Golden Globe). However, ""Despicable Me 2"" is a strong contender; while not quite as inventive in the animation department, or musically, it still manages to be the most entertaining film and that should count for something. Of the two, this is the one that will probably get more repeat viewings.Mysteriously, Pharrell Williams' ""Happy"" was nominated for best original song. As great as this film may be, the music is not its strong point. Not that ""Happy"" is a bad song, but it does very little to stand out and seems an odd choice. Two songs from ""Frozen"" could have been chosen and this would make more sense than ""Happy"" (though there might be rules against two songs from one film being chosen).Some have alleged anti-Hispanic bias, or even blatant racism, presumably because one character is named El Macho and he runs a Mexican restaurant. A bit stereotypical perhaps, but there was nothing outright offensive. In fact, El macho is shown riding a shark into an active volcano, which is just about the coolest thing anybody could ever do. And the voice actor (Benjamin Bratt) is half-Peruvian...Regardless, this is a great film and deserves a shot at the Oscar, despite the likelihood that ""Frozen"" has it on lock.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Minion Mania,"You have to love a story where the bad guys have reinvented themselves as good guys. Gru (Steve Carell) has teamed up with Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) on their new business of producing jams and jelly. With that being said the creators had to find a new nemesis to fill the part; along comes El Macho (Benjamin Bratt) who is intent on taking over the planet (what else is new). I guess he figured if bad guys can turn good then the reverse should also be possible and he has invented a potion that will do just that. Since no one knows more about how the evil mind works then Gru, he is enlisted by the Anti-Villain League to find and bring down the bad guy. Joining him in this effort is their newest agent Lucy (Kristen Wiig). Lucy swings into action as soon as she is introduced and I have to say that James Bond has nothing on this girl. While all this is going on, Gru is trying to be a normal parent to his adoptive daughters Edith (Dana Gaier), Agnes (Elise Fisher) and Margo (Miranda Cosgrove). Margo is having some issues of her own as she is experiencing puppy love for the first time with a very cute, leather-clad boy named Antonio (Moises Arias). Okay, on to the minions. Whoever invented these guys have a heck of an imagination and I am looking forward to their own film coming out. They were, of course, the funniest characters in this film. As I sat in the theater and watched kid after kid dragging in a stuffed minion, I thought that they loved them as much as I did. With all the big blockbusters this summer such as Man of Steel, Ironman 3 and Star Trek Into Darkness, I think that this film will stand up to all of them in terms of revenue. This film is as good as the first one and may even be better. I have to also say that it was full of action without being violent. There was also plenty of silliness, fun and even a bit of romance. I did not see this film in 3D but I could see parts that would have been very interesting in 3D. I would probably see more films in 3D if they ever came up with a way that you didn't have to wear those stupid glasses. Anyway, I recommend that you have a family day at the movies.

Now with added Minion action,"If you are regular cinema goer to Odeon Cinemas in the UK you would have bombarded with advertisement for Despicable Me 2, since Christmas. Despite this advertising overload to some viewers, Despicable Me 2 turns out to fun continuous for the series, even if it does occasionally retread some of the same material.Since the events of the first film Gru (Steve Carell) has given up being a villain and sets out to be good father to Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier) and Agnes (Elsie Fisher) with the help of his little yellow Minions. But a new villain has emerged by stealing a secret Russian lab with formula which can turn anything into a purple hairy destructive beast. With no leads the Anti-Villain League (AVL) recruits Gru to find the villain who is located in a mall. Yet sparks starts to between Gru and his partner, Agent Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wigg) while someone is kidnapping the Minions.Despicable Me 2 continues what worked in the first film, the physical and visual humour, the slapstick and the Minions. This film has much more Minion action as they hurt each other, dance or simply enjoying life and this time they play a much bigger part to the story. The Minions are fun creatures and fans of them will be satisfied with their additional screen time. But the Minions are not the only physically comic characters, Despicable Me 2 introduces a new character, the psycho chicken and he is awesome as a guard dog and provides great humour.Wigg is not a new actress to series, but her character is new. Wigg gave an enthusiastic performance as the eager Agent Wilde, a woman who loves her job. Wigg is known comic actress and she has excellent comedic timing to enhance her lines. Occasionally she does comes off as an embarrassing mom and Wilde is a very Wiggequese character, so people who dislike Wigg will struggle to like her character. But for most people there are plenty of character qualities to make her very likable. Steve Coogan is also a new addition to the series as Silas Ramsbottom (ha, ha, bottom): he is a much more serious, deadpan performance but he still makes an impression and he has some good lines.Benjamin Bratt was brought in as a last minute replacement for Javier Bardem and Al Pacino as the film's antagonist. For someone who had to work on his role very quickly he brought out a larger then live character as Eduardo the dancing Mexican restaurant owner. He is a much more entertaining character than Vector from the last film.The original Despicable Me had the visual look of a Saturday Morning Cartoon with better animation. The sequel underplays this element and has more of a Bondesque, The Incredibles look to. The AVL Headquarters more like a Bond villain's lair. The backstory of the villain El Macho, the most manly villain ever, was told in very entertaining flashbacks and his manly death felt very much like the superhero deaths in The Incredibles.In comparison to the first film, Despicable Me 2 does sometimes meander and looks at subplots, particular Margo falling for a boy and Gru's love life. The flow was not as natural as Despicable Me. At times, Despicable Me 2 plays like a romantic-comedy as well as a sci-fi animated film.Near the end of Despicable Me 2 repeats some of the same plot points of the first film, even if the make-up is slightly different. It could be argued that this is simply following typical screen writing tropes but it generally takes small step back for a film that actually worked as a continuation to the story. There are also a couple of repeated jokes, but it could easily be seen as a running jokes.Despicable Me 2 is a delightful family film that will please fans of the original and adults and children alike. It is a film that plenty of humour with different types of jokes during its run time and serves as what a sequel should be, a continuous of a story.

When a Sequel Is Done Right,"It seems unfortunately common for a good film to get a sequel and for that sequel to be a grave letdown. Sometimes they will change too much and lose the qualities that made the first film so likable and at others they seem to do nothing but rehash the same ideas that we saw the first time round. It's probably because it's tough to make common ground between these two possibilities to make the sequel worthwhile. Luckily Despicable Me 2 falls into neither of these categories, remaining as fun as the original and continuing to entertain us with the same visual based gags and ludicrous premise.The premise this time around being that Gru has given up being an evil doer and has instead begun to make jam (the jam causes the minions to run in disgust) so he can spend time with his three girls. But he is quickly recruited by the anti villain league and partnered with the secret agent Lucy to track down a new super villain. In the meantime his minions slowly begin to disappear being taken under various mysterious circumstances. It's a nice ridiculous plot that does have time for moments of real sentiment as we see Gru being a father and his attempts at finding love.Of course whilst sentiment and emotion are all well and good, just like the original film it is the comedy that never ceases to entertain and keeps us watching this franchise. It's a kind of universal comedy that can be loved by all through its focus on visual gags similar to something like Mr Bean or Tom and Jerry mixed with some hilarious dialogue (the name Ramsbottom still makes me chuckle). It doesn't matter if you're young or old, the silly nature of the film continues to make you laugh just as it did the first time round. The humour does die down towards the end with far fewer jokes being packed in to the climax, but it's still a film that knows how to make great comedy.But what is able to make the film so funny? The minion's of course! These little guys have become the franchises mascots, with the marketing being entirely focused around those little things. The next film's even going to be a prequel entirely devoted to the minions. I don't know whether the writers ever knew that these characters would become so big, but now they are instantly amongst the most recognisable figures in modern animation with their large eyes and squishy yellow body becoming a regular fixture within many children's bedrooms. All this because every second they're on screen you'll be assured some great laughs with their silly voices and their adventurous nature.After gaining 970 million dollars at the box office, this is a franchise that is not going to die down anytime soon. And I'm glad. It may not create the same feeling of fantasy as Kung Fu Panda does or the sense of adventure in the Toy Story films. Instead it makes you laugh at every opportunity and through this it is sure to become a classic as one of the best feel good franchises. I can only hope that all the future instalments have the same level of charm and enthusiasm that have made these first two films so incredible.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Better than original!! Fun for everyone!!,"A rare feat for any movie that part 2 is better than the original but I loved this movie!! Funnier and more minions!!

Disappointed but entertained,"I came into this film with great (but realistic) expectations, 'cause it is after all a sequel. Still this film hit just below the bar I had raised.First of all, the plot was not as creative and original as the first. Second of all, neither was the dialogue/script. They both lacked depth, proficiency and pioneering. They really had something amazing to build on from the first film and I don't feel that they seized that opportunity.The jokes weren't as funny, the characters weren't as well written. They just took all the good stuff from the first and added some cheap new characters to complete the cheap plot. And when I say cheap, I just mean they took an easy way out on this one.And what disappointed me the most was that the emotional depth that blew me away in the first, was gone. All that misery and evil that really made the characters who they were and really made you feel with them, it was just gone.But it did contain a great amount of laughter. So in the end, you did receive a very entertaining film for the entire family (mostly children on this one), but don't go into this one expecting the copious amount of emotions that you got from the first film. It was the typical automatic sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Just one word ...Boring,"Why did they do it? Seriously man, the first movie which came out in 2010 was pretty good with a charm of its own and this time they have killed (almost) all the joy and the fun.The love story in the film felt so forced, the dialogs were clichéd and scenes were so predictable. I watched it on my PC and have to literally fast forward some of the scenes. The plot was so lame that even a 3rd grade kid can figure out what's going to happen. No to mention that they pretty much blew the suspense within the first 30 minutes.Though i have to admit that animation was top notch but then, which movie doesn't have that nowadays? .The fundamental problem with this sequel lies in the script which can't hold on its own even on the solid foundation of its predecessor.This time Gru reluctantly agrees to help Anti-Villain League in finding out a criminal mastermind who is stealing research stations from Antarctica and doing other shitty stuff. Well thats pretty much of the story!, and I don't even want to talk about the love angle. But, one thing which IMHO the director has done right is to give more focus to minions this time. At first it looked unnecessary but in the end I realized that whatever funny moments this flick had were those with minions in it.Anyways, I can only say that much about this movie. My genuine advice to you guys would be to wait for it to come on TV, don't waste your hard earned money to watch it on Netflix.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Bravo! More despicable excellence,It's very common for the sequel of an excellent animated movie to be a letdown. This however is not in that category. It builds right away from where the last one left off. In fact I liked this one even more. It further solidifies Gru's new role as a loving dad and shows the girls growing up/ developing new interests. We are introduced to a couple new characters and they mesh well with the originals. Like the first I just love how they are able to make the movie so silly and yet still tell a story. I found the villain in this second movie to even be more interesting than the first.Both Despicable Me and Despicable Me 2 are animated family classics in my opinion and should be on a must watch list for all movie lovers.,9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A fun but familiar sequel,"""Despicable Me 2,"" directed by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud, continues the delightful adventures of Gru (voiced by Steve Carell), the former super-villain turned doting father. This sequel dives into new territory as Gru is recruited by the Anti-Villain League to track down a new criminal mastermind.The film's charm lies in its quirky characters and humor. Steve Carell's performance as Gru is as endearing as ever, balancing his gruff exterior with a heartwarming softness. Kristen Wiig's character, Lucy Wilde, adds a fun and energetic dynamic as Gru's partner in crime-fighting. The true stars, however, are the Minions. Their antics and slapstick humor provide constant laughs, making them irresistible to both kids and adults.Visually, the film is vibrant and engaging, with creative set pieces and imaginative gadgets. The plot, while straightforward, is filled with enough twists and turns to keep viewers entertained. The themes of family, love, and redemption are seamlessly woven into the story, adding depth to the comedic escapades.Overall, ""Despicable Me 2"" is a fun and heartwarming sequel that successfully builds on the original's charm, offering a perfect mix of humor, adventure, and heartfelt moments.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
as good as the prequel; a little boring at times; excellent ending; after the end I felt I cared and cherished the characters; very meaningful and rewarding ending,"100% spoiler-free.What is more important than family, right?This sequel is ""more of the same,"" meaning that it offers everything the first film offered and has the same strengths. However, this sequel is was a little boring for me and it did not get interesting until the villain and his plot was revealed and it got even better when I saw the ending. This movie had a very strong ending and such ending made me love the characters and made me have an emotional connection with the characters. Finally, I CARED about the characters. The ending was great, although it could have also been ""sweet"" (i.e., family-heart-warming-sweet). Still, great ending.Once again, the terminal goal of the plot is VERY meaningful and the ending was very rewarding for the three kids and for us the audience who definitely appreciate family.Conclusion: this movie is a good watch and definitely worth watching.

Follow-up invites high expectations,"I thought the shift from domestic to adventure was a stretch. But I enjoyed the voices/characters. I thought it seemed less than the original. But I went along for the ride. I gave it seven but it is easily an eight. It was a work of love, obviously, and it showed. I had a bit of a cold which added to my attitude of stepping back to see what appealed to my six-year old granddaughter. There was a plot to carry you along with the romance that Gru felt compelled to resist. The children were laughing and so were the adults. Good fun for the whole family. Can there be a DM3? Sure. You cannot say that you will never see a dark day again in your life. There is always another call for Gru's skill set.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
It was good in what it did.,"I recently watched this film with my brother, his girlfriend and my sister and myself, I couldn't wipe the grin from my face for hours. The plot is nowhere close to strong, there are major plot holes and the characters were kinda meh, but for once that wasn't the goal of DM2. The goal was random, immature (hehe, bottom) and absurd humor and it did that with brilliance, even the bumper from Illumination was hilarious.Conclusion: If you're going to this movie as a fan critic you might not have the evening of your life, but if you're going expecting a good amount of humor for any age then this is a movie you cannot miss.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Fun sequel,"""Despicable Me 2"" provides us with the further adventures of Gru, the arch villain who, at the end of the first film, had given up his evil ways to become a doting dad and a respectable business man. However, because he has insider knowledge on how evildoers work, he's been tapped by a top-secret spy organization to go undercover and help save the world from bad guys who are not quite as reformed as he is. Gru teams up with Lucy Wilde, an attractive agent who also becomes a love interest, to find out who absconded with an entire research laboratory in the Arctic with the use of a giant magnet.While it's true that Gru, as a character, is probably more interesting and fun when he's plotting a crime rather than fighting it, ""Despicable Me 2"" is still an entertaining and colorful diversion for audiences of all ages. Steve Carell, Kristin Wiig, Benjamin Bratt, Russell Brand, Steve Coogan and Ken Jeong are some of the better-known actors who provide the voice work for the film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Knocking the Lone Ranger's hat clean off.,"""But the real gift of this little animation gem is homely Gru, the world's best villain but financially least productive. His plan to steal the moon is about the cleverest comment on how much we have stolen, innocence among the treasures; the moon is all we have left to lose. But there is also something else to be stolen—Gru's heart—and that's easily filched by Agnes, Margo, and Edith, orphans selling the equivalent of girl scout cookies but sub textually a heart for a villain who doesn't know yet it's a loving parent's.""Those were my words 3 years ago about Despicable Me, and I stand by them for this year's Despicable Me 2 with one change: Gru's (voice of Steve Carell) heart is to be stolen again, this time by the Anti-Villain League's techno titan, big-nosed Lucy. Having proved herself a formidable agent, she joins Gru's new mission to stop super villain, El Macho (Benjamin Bratt), before his diabolical, out-sized magnet sucks up the entire earth.There's a reason this animation is knocking off the Lone-Ranger's ten-gallon hat this summer: Despicable is lovable: a genuine heart beats in all its characters, from cute-as-hell near-sighted, yellow Minions to the new villain, whose Latino heart beats strong, if for the wrong reasons. Somehow the slightly fey Ranger and the ambiguous Indian cannot capture the same romance.Gru is the unlikely hero once again, a model of rehabilitation who could prepare the younger generation for the myriad comebacks such as Eliot Spitzer, Mark Sanford, and Anthony Weiner:Gru: Yes, I have been recruited by a top secret agency to go undercover and save the world.Edith: You're gonna be a spy?Gru: *That's* right, baby! Gru's back in the game with gadgets and weapons and cool cars!His date with a big-lipped valley girl is disastrous enough to make any single male move into a monastery.

Borrows Smartly From Many Sources,"My first impression when watching the opening act in this high profile sequel was that they were trying to make ""Incredibles 2"" (which is happily finally going to be a reality). In this case we are dazzled by a Bond-ish type car loaded with secret weapons and other super capabilities. I feared when seeing the trailers for this film that the minions would take up most of the screen time. Thankfully there is a carefully calculated balance between glitzy action scenes with enhanced 3D shots and the kid friendly goofing around with just a few minions here and there.The other resemblance to ""Incredibles"" was the animation style taking directly from Chuck Jones (Roadrunner cartoons). I got a good chuckle from an over-the-top Chuck Jones style introduction to the main villain. Some banter is developed between Steve Carell and Kristen Wiig. Physical gags rule the momentum as everyone propels themselves into other objects and other people. It is actually a risky move as they also retain the level of cartoon violence that was more acceptable back in the mid-50s than it is today. Again, this is a very calculated move to keep adults watching.As for the story, it borrows from many well known scenes from famous movies. Raiders of the Lost Ark, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Finding Nemo, amongst others. So not much for originality, nice look, but a generic villain. 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"I really liked it, very funny and great fun. Not as good as the first one.","DESPICABLE ME 2It was a very funny film, but nowhere near as good as the original movie.Gru is recruited by the Anti-Villain League to track down a super villain who has stolen an entire research lab from the Arctic. Gru has to investigate this crime with his new partner, Lucy. Whilst all this is going on, his oldest daughter has started to find boys attractive which then leads Gru to anger and he has to do his investigations whilst watching his daughter with this new boy... and if that wasn't enough, his minions are getting kidnapped too.The story was enjoyable, and the characters were brilliant. The thing I noticed about this film the most though, is they film makers knew that the minions were really popular from the original movie, so they made them more of the main characters in this one. I thought the minions had the funny parts and were the main advertising technique they used for the film. The only thing I was slightly disappointed with, was the really funny bits of the movie were shown in the trailer... there are other really good bits, but most of the them I had already seen.The voice cast was quite impressive, but I never understood why. Steve Carell, Kristen Wiig, Benjamin Bratt, Mirander Cosgrove, Russell Brand, Ken Jeong & Steve Coogan are the voices. Why would the movie company pay so much more for famous people to use their voices, when they could clearly find someone unknown and the audience would not know the difference? Especially Steve and Russell... if I didn't already know that they did these voices, I would never had recognised them, so surely they could have found someone cheaper. But I don't mind... it's their money. I suppose it is just to draw in the crowd a bit more.This movie is great for kids and will keep them quiet and entertained for the duration.

Despicable Me 2: Much Funnier!,"Great movie for the whole family to enjoy
Much funnier than the first one, Despicable Me 2 actually has me liking the second installation in a series much better than the original. A lot of sequels add in new characters. Some serve a purpose. Others not so much. This movie adds in new characters that are important. With funnier lines, funnier actions, and tons of minion madness, the movie has us focusing less on Gru's villainy, and more on the love life he never had.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Just as Despicable,"To produce the perfect sequel animated or not is hard to do, especially in the case of this film where the original was so beloved.I think the smart move made by the creative powers that be was to take the bits of the original that people enjoyed and make more of them. So yes, we get a lot more minions and a lot more interaction between Gru and his girls.The character of Gru is developed well which was important and there is some genuine heart to be found in amongst a wide range of jokes that appeal to both kids and the adults who've more than likely taken them to see it.This sequel achieves it's aim of bettering (or at least being on par with) the original but I think it would be better to leave the series on a high rather than produce further sequels.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Great family fun,"Just like the space dolls on ""Toy Story"", in the Despicable Me films, the supposed supporting players, ""Minions"", are now running the asylum.Gru (Voice - Steve Carrell) is now officially retired from devising dastardly plots to steal the moon and so forth. He now lives peacefully at home looking after his cute as a button animated kids Margo, Edith and Agnes, life is good and world domination now seems but a distant dream.Enter stage left Lucy Wilde (Voice - Kirsten Wiig) from the AVL (Anti Villain League) tasked with finding out what occurred in the Arctic Circle where a Mutagen PX-41 was stolen using a giant magnet, as you do.Re-activating a villain to catch a villain is an old trick but Gru is not that interested, he enjoys his life as a devoted father, the kids, the minions, all is good.Meanwhile Dr Nefario (Voice - Russell Brand), Gru's devoted crazy boffin type, decides to leave Gru's employment, he ""missed being evil"" and leaves in quite spectacular style, as long as you have time to wait.Eventually Gru bows to the inevitable and partners with the under cover Wilde, in a shopping mall Bakery ""Bake my day"", enabling them to stake out a possible uber villain, El Macho (Voice - Benjamin Bratt).As you can imagine the plot descends into chaos from here and nothing runs smoothly. To detail the plot would be an exercise in pointless surrealism, so safe to say this is used as a framework on which to hang some great visual and voice gags whilst providing a convenient stage for the star of the show, the Minions.Poor old Gru, upstaged in his own film by the very characters that should be his underlings, never mind, the audience gets the benefit.From vacuuming French maid minions, to YMCA outfitted groups, followed by an almost surreal song, sung in a made up language ""frenchstyle"", it is obvious the writers were given free rein with their favourite characters. At times it feels like the writers and animators were fuelled by more than diet coke but overall this works a treat.There are real laughs and you may never be able to say the word ""banana"" or ""bottom"" without thinking of a yellow minion in the future. This is inspired, daft fun.There is a downside in that the story, however silly, does get to play second fiddle to the Minions ever increasing screen-time and arguably the film does lose it's heart somewhat. This will be of no concern to the ankle-biters but apart from good laughs, this misses the under the cover adult depth, so beloved of Pixar movies.With world wide box office of $918m, second only to Iron Man 3 in 2013, expect to see more despicable behaviour on the big screen sometime soon.SummaryGreat family fun, pushing the minions to centre stage provides great laughs, occasionally to the detriment of the movie as a whole but most will not care.

Not so Despicable at all,"In a perfect world or in movie-world there is a clear line between good and bad, hero and villain. Well, lives isn't that black and white, nor are the movies now for that matter. Why can't we have a bad guy who is good as well? Movies have already dabbled in the anti-hero, so I think it is time for the lovable villain, or at least one who has a heart. I am not talking about having the next James Bond villain want to take Mr. Bond for ice cream instead of killing him. What I want is someone like Gru (Steve Carell), a bad guy who discovers his heart, but still has that evil streak in him.In 2010's ""Despicable Me"" we were introduced to Gru as he tried to take over the world, only to have his life taken over by three little girls. These girls Agnes (Elsie Fisher), Margo (Miranda Crosgrove) and Edith (Dana Gaier) malted Gru's heart and made him not want to be so evil. In fact Gru is out of the 'Evil' business now and he no longer has his minions preparing for world domination, instead he has them making jam. Super villains are still out there, and one of them has stolen a formula that could cause the world problems if they are not found soon. So how do you catch a super villain you ask? You use an ex super villain to track them down. The Anti Villain League recruits Gru and teams him with Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig). Together they must find the mystery villain and save the world from whatever evil plan he has in store for us all.It seems that most animated movies now are just franchises waiting to happen. Even the mighty Pixar has started to return to the well more often. Why does it seem every animated movie has a sequel now? Well it is pretty simple. Dollar signs. Unlike most sequels though, animated movie's quality can stay relatively the same. Maybe it is because they keep it simple, they don't try to outdo the first film, and they just make a good movie. In the case of ""Despicable Me 2"" they don't let you down, they bring the same laughs as the first film. Stephen Carell is great as Gru, but the minions once again steal the show. Who don't love a little yellow guy who always seems to want to do well by his boss, but always seems to cause trouble. It's like watching those old Saturday morning cartoons, waiting to see what the minions will get themselves into. The other thing about this film is the 3D looks good, especially as you watch the credits sequence. I look forward to animated movie sequels, because the filmmakers who make them know what they are. These movies are suppose to be fun, something the whole family can enjoy, and with ""Despicable Me 2"" they did what they were suppose to do, make a fun movie.http://the2cinemen.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Just as Lovable and Funny as Before, But ...","The first ""Despicable Me"" back in 2010 was an unexpected heartwarming surprise for me. I did not think I would like that film because of the strange-looking artwork of the unorthodox characters. But the main story of the film, about how a super-villain named Gru, who wanted to steal the Moon, reformed to become a dedicated family man to three orphaned girls Margo, Edith and Agnes, was its best feature.This story of this sequel is about the reformed Gru (still voiced by Steve Carell) being recruited by the Anti-Villain League to be their secret agent. His mission was to discover and apprehend the evil criminal who had developed a toxin which can turn any being into destructive purple hairy monsters upon injection.While this mission was going on, Gru was also having difficulty admitting his romantic feelings for kooky partner Lucy (Kristen Wiig), as well as trying to break up another romance budding between his eldest daughter Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) and her dashing Latino admirer, who was the son of the man Gru suspects to be the diabolical El Macho.Unfortunately, the story is not really much to be excited too much about this time, unlike the first one which was totally original and endearing. The first film was already perfect as it was as a stand-alone film. I actually thought and even hoped back then that there would be no more sequels to that one. But you know Hollywood, they will try and squeeze out whatever they can from a successful franchise like this one.The star of this film is the colorful and vibrant artwork. We watched this film in 3D and it was awesome and worth the money it cost. The face of Gru himself alone, with that pointy nose of his, is made for 3D. The 3D animation was breath-taking in so many scenes, especially those where there was a speeding submarine underwater, the car hurtling out of the mall window, a jelly fight of epic proportions, an exploding volcano, up to the Minions antics during the final credits.I liked the first film better than this one. This sequel, while still enjoyable, focused more on the relationship between Gru and Lucy. It had little of those delightful encounters between Gru and his daughters which made the first film uniquely appealing. I wanted to see more of cute little Agnes most of all. While she had her little touching moment at the end, it was just too short to make too much of an impact.But definitely, this is one very funny and entertaining film for the whole family. Fans of those naughty little yellow Minions will rejoice as they have practically half of the movie running time dedicated to them, and there are so many more of them here. Fans of good 3D effects will really find this film so cool. I just missed some of the heart that made the first installment more than special.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
One hilarious-of-a-kind,"Minions alone can make the audience laugh. Adding to that is Gru & the 3 little kids action. This is one hilarious movie ever. Though it has lower ratings than the 1st one, I must say that this is better. And the fact that most audience was adults, it means that the movie gets the heart of both children & child-in-mind movie-goers. Though something was missing... and I can't even figure out what is it. Maybe it is the lack of villains. I mean, compared to the 1st one, the villain took most of the part of the movie. But on this one, only a little about it. But the way the minions delivers their actions, I can totally say that this is a good movie. The after credits makes me think that there's gonna be a 3rd movie. And boy I can't wait for that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"No surprises - ""Despicable Me 2"" measures up","They've done it again. The 2010 hit ""Despicable Me"" offered up a kind of family-friendly entertainment that only a cold-hearted cynic could actually despise. Its ""Looney Tunes""-like slapstick offered light and lovable counter-programming to the visually stunning and emotion- filled animated films of the big studios such as DreamWorks and Pixar. In ""Despicable Me 2,"" Illumination Entertainment and Universal Pictures apply the ""if it ain't broke..."" approach and have churned out a sequel that in every way lives up to its predecessor.This achievement isn't exactly staggering. As enjoyable as the first film was, it fell squarely into kid-focused entertainment with a hidden entertainment value for adults. The gags were mostly physical, immature and celebrated violence as a means to a laugh. Nothing has changed with ""Despicable Me 2."" Fortunately, the quad team of directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud with writers Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul works just hard enough to keep the ""Despicable"" shtick fresh.The film reacquaints us with Gru (Steve Carell) as he adapts to life without super-villainy while taking care of his adopted girls, Margo, Edith and Agnes. Suddenly, he's abducted by the Anti- Villain League and brought to their underwater headquarters by the eccentric agent Lucy (Kristen Wiig). They explain a villain has stolen a very dangerous serum of sorts and request Gru's help as a former super-villain. Gru gives them the cold shoulder the first time around, but naturally changes his mind. Teamed up with Lucy, they narrow their search to a local mall, where Gru discovers a man he thinks to be the famed and presumably dead villain El Macho (Benjamin Bratt).The villain of the movie remains a mystery though his plan involves kidnapping Gru's lovable minions. That said, plot doesn't hold much weight when it comes to enjoying ""Despicable Me 2,"" as was the case with the first film. The movie instead rides on the success of its antics, be it slapstick or subtle, clever humor — or even a combination of both as is frequently the case.In terms of heart-warming family themes, ""Despicable Me 2"" opts for cliché. As a single father, Gru is highly motivated by keeping the young Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) away from boys and the neighborhood housewives are all intent with fixing him up. His girls, especially Agnes, are all excited by the possibility of having a mom, and looking around the options are ... pretty clear.Sticking to the mold isn't as easy as it probably should be, so props to Illumination Entertainment for matching the hype. As such, ""Despicable Me 2"" shouldn't find many detractors. At the same time, it remains a fun diversion in comparison to animated films from DreamWorks and Pixar, which (mostly) continue to innovate rather than stick to a formula while delivering a similar caliber of entertainment.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Great family film,"I saw this movie with my family, this includes a three year old and a five year old. We all enjoyed the movie. Sometimes hard to do at the drive in, that is where we watched it. Still it kept us all entertained. All the characters from the original were still very funny and fresh. The youngest sister is still so adorable. I liked Kristen Wiig's new character as well. Made it into a sweet story. It's funny she was in both movies but had different parts and different voices to go with them. Very talented. I would recommend this movie to both adults and kids. I would watch this movie even if I didn't have kids. Although, my kids are still repeating lines from the movie. Certainly left an impression on them. And me.

The Vidiot Reviews,"Despicable Me 2The reason super villains don't date is because they're obligated to dine and dash.Thankfully, the scoundrel in this animated movie has abandoned the bad life.Rearing his daughters (Miranda Cosgrove, Elsie Fisher, Dana Gaier) in suburbia, former baddie Gru (Steve Carell) is enlisted by The Anti-Villain League to apprehend a thief who stole a transformative formula.Partnered with an AVL agent (Kristen Wiig), Gru targets the local mall.Zoning in on super villain turned restaurateur El Macho (Benjamin Bratt) as the culprit, Gru is stunned when the heist is blamed on a wig shop owner (Ken Jeong) instead.Meanwhile, his lovable minions have been malformed into macabre menaces.The obvious sequel to the original success, number 2 delivers the same juvenile laughs while also exploring single parenting further.In fact, 9 times out of 10, the children of super villains grow up to lead very meaningful lives via identity theft.

Hilarious family film!,"Despicable Me 2 by Walt Disney Movies is great for so many reasons. It is pretty much viewable to anyone aged from 3 to 103 and they would enjoy Despicable Me 2 especially in the cinema, on the big screen. People mostly will love the minions' riot of anarchic slapstick with their antics and their strange delighted helium-induced jabbering's which are really the heart of this Disney movie. Best of all, the minions are mostly sweet and innocent, and represent so much the joy and exuberance of living in the moment that it's impossible for anyone to watch this film or give a film review and not be happy or give a positive review. I'm pretty sure that they will get their own movie at some point by obtaining DVD releases. The new DVD releases of the Despicable Me 2 movie is a must see after Despicable Me (part 1). Walt Disney did an outstanding job as usual and added the perfect touch Despicable Me so that Despicable Me 2 could be even better on DVD release.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Laughed until I couldn't breath!!!,"I was just looking for a place to post about this movie.... Passed it several times on pay-per-view thinking it couldn't be appealing to adults. Still not sure how I chose to watch it, but-- I AM SO GLAD I DID! I laughed so hard throughout the movie and especially at two scenes that involve a fake tube of lipstick. This move is great for the whole family. Action adventure is my usual genre, sometimes a break from the usual is a good thing, will be recommending it to all my friends who want to pause the blood and gore.

"You can't explain exactly why, but the minions make you laugh a lot!","This movie is a kind of movie that you as an adult can't explain honestly. Maybe has this kind of child movie sensation but at the same time you're laughing a lot. The crowd can't stop laughing. This minions are so contagious that their creators deserves a prize not just for the quality of the characters but for getting a so unique way of make people happy. Because the people leaves the room with a happy face. They are like tickles, you just can't resist. Period. The plot is not a Mensa product but it doesn't matter, it makes you laugh! Maybe the pitch, the form of the minions, i don't know. You will get contagious fun. Also the story has nice heartwarming moments that deserves the ticket on its own. Gru is a terrific character and the new female agent is a very good one too. Color are nicely balanced and makes panoramic shots looks very natural. The little kids are screen candies, very funny and cutes. It is not a Shrek 2 but for sure is a terrific second part for a surprising franchise. For sure deserves a sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
How to Ruin a Great Idea,"A dull tedious love story featuring Gru, now a retired villain and single dad with three kids, rather than a clever evil genius. They created one of the best animated characters for a good while then wasted him on this woeful script. Avoid at all costs unless you've got your kids with you.The theme is quite childish really and they have lost all appeal to an adult. Gru is often embarrassed around his new lady friend, the kids are sickeningly sweet and the minions make more silly noises and dress in ridiculous costumes, aiming for cheap laughs. Great for kids who laugh loud and long but it's a poor ending for poor old Gru. A kidnapping of the kids would have been a better option, forcing Gru to go back to his evil ways, the strengths of his character, but they chose a weak option.",1.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Absolute Minion fun the second time around.,"""Despicable Me 2"" succeeds as one of the best animation sequels of the year, bolstered with a great voice actor ensemble reprising the role of Steve Carrell as Gru, the uncanny daddy dangerous, and his little cute girls Margot –played by Miranda Cosgrove–, Edith –Dana Gaier–, and Agnes –by Elsie Fisher–. Of course, the Minions are back and even crazier and gibberish, it's an absolute howl.The film offers vast improvement from its predecessor. It will always mold an impression to its general patronage for it's seldom they encounter such animation feature which is not from the hands of Disney- Pixar or Dreamworks. And now that the sequel has come out, Despicable Me 2 is even funnier and sure get your money's worth.A top-secret headquarters called AVL, or the Anti-Villain League by Agent Lucy Wilde –voiced by Kristen Wiig – and the league director Silas Ramsbottom –voiced by Steve Coogan– hire Gru. The investigation leads to a mutation serum that make creatures go purple and berserk. So Gru and Lucy's job together is to locate the remaining serum.Another character is Eduardo –voiced by Benjamin Bratt–, whom Gru suspects as the El-Macho. Whether he has the serum or not, he may still be recognizable enough to be villainy as Gru suggests. Benjamin Bratt as the El-Macho is unrecognizable at first because of his Mexican accent, and so is Gru's mad scientist assistant Dr. Nefario –played by Russell Brand– who's voice as a grumpy old man may seem odd but acceptable.Despicable Me 2 works on its slacker humors involving Gru with his lanky stature and pointy nose and his spy gadgets. Aside from the Minions, the film made sure his jokey dialogues and the gibberish language of the Minions are sensible. Steve Carrell still has the impending voice-over as Gru. The irony of his tone in the character makes me laugh just as I did in the first film, and it still doesn't spoil my liking.The new characters on board such as Kristen Wiig as Lucy gives an elusive improvement in Gru's anti-social but odd humor as a loner. Wiig is the perfect voice-over for the character and matches Gru to be the exact partner, better yet the perfect lovey-dovey. However, Ken Jeong is the odd one out in the mix. His character as the wig man Floyd is pretty thin unlike the other ones. I'm obliged that he were able to voice act in the film though.Finally, the Minions are here to stay. They look adorable akin to the previous film with the same babbling offbeat and gibberish dialogue. There're too many too count, but I didn't care much as long as plenty of them keep the laughter piling up.Kudos to production company Illumination Mac Guff (the company behind the VFX of the film), if they're planning for a Despicable 3, I don't see 'why not?' If this animation feature became of a franchise, looks like I will be counting Minions to laugh with. But as for now, I'm telling you that Despicable Me 2 is even funnier and affable to be one of the best animation films of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The minions are back,"After all, it took some skill to mix all that madness on the moon with a beautiful side story about a trio of orphaned girls who later win Gru's heart. Even while the new version lacks that creative spark, there is still a lot to love thanks to the vivacious visuals and a flawless voice cast lead by the naturally animated Steve Carell.A second enjoyable 3D presentation, once again led by a few of those crazy Minions, will be missed by those who mistakenly decide to leave at the beginning of the end credits.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Maybe not quite as good as the first, but it's still just as comedic and entertaining","The overall movie and story, including all the classic characters from the first as well as some unique new characters, continues to be a lot of fun, colorful, high-tech, and interesting. It's much similar to the first, the major differences being that Gru is now an official parent to Margo, Edith and Agnes and instead of plotting evil, he stops it. When I first watched this, I was not so convinced when it came to comparison to the previous film. El Macho was not nearly as good of a nemesis as Vector was, and some of the jokes may not have been as good either. As time went on, it did get a little better, but even the upcoming Despicable Me 3 will probably not even top the first classic for all IÃ¢??m concerned. As a whole, there was pretty much the same amount of amusement, it had a good music score, and it was well done for a sequel when it comes to the ratings especially.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Quite possibly one of the funniest movies of all time,"If there are two things I love in an animation film those things are a good story and plenty of laughs. Although in this movie one eclipses the other by a large margin, Despicable Me 2 is as good a story as any. Now a family man, Gru has given up his evil ways and is stuck in sort of a rut. When he is recruited by the Anti Villain League he grabs the chance to once again experience a thrilling life, but at what cost is the question. Steve Carell reprises his role and shines yet again. All of the mannerisms in Gru's character are very well played and you laugh and cry along with him throughout the movie. Newcomer Kristen Wiig is a very welcome addition to the saga. Her quirky agent Lucy is a delightful character and provides a few giggles herself. However all of these great roles are overshadowed by those crazy yellow creatures known as the minions. In every scene they make an appearance they steal the show and leave you wanting more. Cuteness is also a factor played out very well by the Gru's girls with Agnes leaving a white smile in your face every time she speaks. Probably not a masterpiece of a movie, Despicable Me 2 is a hell of an entertaining piece of blockbuster cinema and feels fresh every time you watch it. Personally I find it to be one of the funniest movies of all time and overall a fantastic way to spend 1 1/2 hours without any worries at all.Rating 9/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Minions!,"This much like the first movie is a hilarious masterpiece. This time around Gru and his 3 girls are together and he starts out being on the legit side of things(seems he's retired from the villain game).

If they made an entire movie out of nothing but minions I would be on cloud 9, but the makers of the entire Despicable me series are pure geniuses when it comes to both comedy and timing. This is one of the very few animated cartoons that I can truly say is not cheesy.They've managed to capture the magic of a fantastically funny world without taking away anything from any age group.

A Comedy for Small Children,"Standing as one of the most uninteresting protagonists to grace the world of animation in the past few years, my only question is: who really cares about Gru? And after watching ""Despicable Me 2"", I can't for the life of me figure out why the original even merited this sequel if the character of Gru was going to continue to be at the helm. Expecting to see a story about the reformed villain Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) ""getting back into the game"" (by which I mean being recruited by the Anti-Villain League (creative name I know) in order to help with the capture of the next super villain bent on world domination) but instead getting a throw-away love story, with forced sentimentality and a final battle sequence which comes up terribly short.OK, so if you know me then you understand that I don't care for the Minions. But I do get why small children enjoy their incoherent babbling and slapstick antics. And the youngest girl in these films is one of the cutest animated characters outside of any Pixar film. But again, I don't get the appeal of Gru outside of the well conceived plot of the original, which took a lot of people by surprise and which I even gave a positive review to.Synopsis: Watch Gru make silly faces, watch the cute kid be cutesy, but most of all watch the Minions beat each other senseless. This entire movie seems to be the result of a focus group that when asked what they enjoyed most about the first movie responded with a resounding: MINIONS! And so that's essentially what we get here, Minions at every turn. But as the most annoying part of the original, in small doses said Minions had been tolerable. But when said Minions appear in nearly every scene (as they do here) in conjunction with the relentless Minion-centric trailers we all had to sit though lo these past few months, ""Despicable Me 2"" only becomes more tiresome as it moves forward. Well, unless you wanted to see a Minions movie. And honestly, that is what many fans of the original are going to buy a ticket expecting to see. So, what do I know? Highlights: There is one funny character in this movie and it's not Kristen Wiig, who voices Lucy, an agent of the Anti-Villain League and the only character more annoying than the Minions. Clearly the best character in ""Despicable Me 2"" goes by the name of El Macho (voiced by Benjamin Bratt). But between this character, the little girl being cutesy and the two Minion covers of well known songs during the finale which is sure to get a rise out of audiences, the overall entertainment factor is still low if you are going into this film not a Minions apologist.Side Note: Do you know why the Minions aren't funny? Because their style of physical comedy is not at all clever. In fact, I don't believe their style of comedy is meant to be clever, but instead bait cheap laughs. For example: Have you ever seen a grown man hit himself in the face in order to make a crying infant laugh? Well, the Minions are kind of like that. Displaying the most infantile physical humor designed to send a room full of small children into hysterical laughter. So why millions of adults laugh at these antics is beyond me.Final Thought: While it is true that I believe the Minions are the most annoying group of animated characters since the Chipmunks, if you read this review carefully my dislike of ""Despicable Me 2"" goes deeper than a simple hatred of those freaky little tater tots with eyes. ""Despicable Me 2"" is a supremely well animated, predictable and incredibly uncreative shell of the original, with every comedic moment playing for cheap laughs. And unlike most things in life, not even Pharrell can save this production. In short, there is really no reason to watch ""Despicable Me 2"" unless you were dying to see a Minions spin off or you are under 10 years of age.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

Good silly fun,"After the success of 'Despicable Me' (1) a sequel was only a matter of time. If you didn't see the first, it was about - what most people would describe as - you 'pretty clichéd Bond villain,' (aka 'Gru') complete with lair and army of incompetent minions. Only his plans for world domination and chaos are thwarted when he adopts three orphan girls. If you can believe that, you probably enjoyed what followed.Now, we find him making jelly instead of nerve gas and taking his girls to the park. However, because he's turned good, he's recruited by the good-guys to take on a 'real' supervillain. And, naturally, this time round he meets a 'love interest' along the way.The bottom line is that the kids will love this. It kept my nine year old daughter entertained for hours. It's silly, colourful, loud, easy to follow and packed full of delightful animation and visual gags. Plus it contains a healthy dose of spoofing of Bond-type films which will be picked up by the adults.If you have kids, they'll love it and you shouldn't mind watching it with them (a few time, too!). I have to say that, although I enjoyed it, I didn't think it was up to the (high) standards of the Toy Story and Shrek franchises. Even thought I love Steve Carell, if I had my way, I wouldn't watch this more than once. However, that's not an option as my daughter is currently wearing out the DVD in the player.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

No one is ""too cool"" for minions, and I dare say, this movie may have been better than the first one. I, for one, am extremely excited to see what happens if they make a Minion Movie, and I will be there opening weekend.

"Despicable Me 2: Gru's Gone Good, But Are We Having a Gru-Time?","Grab your shrink ray and prepare for another dose of adorable villainy, because Gru is back in Despicable Me 2! This sequel reunites us with the lovable-ish supervillain turned reluctant dad, juggling fatherhood, a new love interest, and a (semi-accidental) stint as a secret agent. Does this follow-up capture the magic of the first film, or is it just another minion-filled rehash?The animation shines again, even more vibrant and detailed than before. The 3D sequences, while not groundbreaking, add a fun depth to the action scenes. Gru's character continues to be a delight, his grumpy exterior slowly melting away thanks to his adopted daughters and the ever-present shenanigans of his minion army. The new characters, like the suave agent Lucy Wilde and the flamboyant villain Eduardo Perez, are entertaining additions, each bringing their own brand of humor and chaos.So, is Despicable Me 2 worth your time? If you enjoyed the first film, then this sequel is a solid follow-up. It offers more of the same humor, heart, and stunning animation. It's a fun family film, light and entertaining, but not likely to blow your mind (unless you get hit by a stray shrink ray, of course).",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"As lively, amusing and wacky as the original, but Gru's falling in love is pure slapstick that lacks the poignancy of his turn as an accidental father the last time round","No one could have quite predicted how delightful and heart-warming 'Despicable Me' would be, and therefore how the debut toon of Chris Meledandri's Illumination Entertainment could have come out of nowhere to give Pixar a good run for its money. Boasting ingenuity and heart in its story of three orphan girls who reform a criminal mastermind and his army of yellow Minions, the film became a monster hit in the summer of 2010, all but guaranteeing this entertaining but slightly less outstanding sequel.Indeed, despite the return of directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud as well as writers Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul, Gru's return feels less inventive than its predecessor, let down most noticeably by the absence of a more character-driven plot. Whereas the first film emphasised Gru's change of heart after turning into foster parent, this one struggles to find a defining character arc for him following his bad-to-good transformation, settling instead for some mild over-protectiveness and a new romantic interest.Gone are the poignant parent-child bonding scenes between Gru and his adopted kids, - Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier) and little Agnes (Elsie Fisher); other than an opening sequence where Gru purposely dresses up as a fairy princess to please Agnes during her birthday party, the rest of the movie barely lets Gru spend any time with his kids. A later subplot that sees Gru's fussing over Margo's teenage crush for a cool Mexican boy feels almost like an afterthough, with most of the attention instead placed on his budding relationship with a female partner Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig).Wilde is the only missing piece to Gru's otherwise picture perfect family existence, so the writers have constructed a skeletal mystery as an excuse to bring Gru and Lucy together. A new agent of the Anti- Villain League, she is tasked by the League's director Silas Ramsbottom (Steve Coogan) to recruit Gru in tracking down the villain responsible for the theft of a dangerous transmutation serum from a top-secret laboratory in the Arctic Circle. Some initial resistance aside (which culminates in a hilarious send-off for Gru's evil mad scientist Dr Nefario - voiced by Russell Brand), Gru opts to join forces with Lucy.Their investigative work largely takes place within a shopping mall, where they set up a cupcake shop as a front to observe the other suspicious shopkeepers - including the owner of a Mexican restaurant called Eduardo (Benjamin Bratt) and the owner of a wig show with the even more eccentric name of Floyd Eagle-san (Ken Jeong). Intended as a perfect complement to Gru, the gregarious Lucy literally bounces and dances around Gru - but though their scenes pop with verve, their relationship lacks the endearment of Gru's with his three girls in the first movie.Seemingly aware of this, the directors carefully balance Gru and Lucy's hyperactive romance with almost stand-alone sequences of the 'oh-so- cute' and utterly irresistible Minions. Not simply in droves - whether making jam and jellies in Gru's lab or rushing in line for a dubious ice cream truck that comes around the neighbourhood - they also appear in amusing twos and threes as firemen, housemaids and babysitters, and perhaps even more so than before, threaten to steal the whole show. Rather than just Gru's assistants, they also have a bigger role to play in the hysterical finale, which deftly ties together what often exists as disparate story strands in the rest of the movie.Yet even though the plotting could do with a little more meshing, the lively visuals and consistently zany energy will surely keep you engaged throughout. Whereas Pixar or even DreamWorks' animation tend to go for beautiful visuals and even a fair amount of restraint, the French-based animators on the 'Despicable Me' movies have opted for complete and unfettered amusement as their top-most priority, and the maniacal energy and sheer nuttiness with which they have crafted many of the laugh-out- loud scenes are infectious to say the least.It certainly helps that they have a voice cast to match their ambition. Steve Carell's combination of deadpan and an Eastern European accent once again lend Gru an inimitable persona, while Wiig's brisk and bouncy delivery works superbly as his accompaniment. In equally comical fashion are other new additions Coogan and Jeong, but the one deserving of special mention is Bratt, whose devilish intonations lend Eduardo (or otherwise referred to as El Macho) both charm and menace.The uniformly excellent voice cast keep up the snappy pace of the movie, which together with the lovable Minions, strive to sustain the same entertainment value as its predecessor. And largely, this is as amusing, lively and even uproarious as the original; yet, beyond the slapstick and physical hijinks, there is still something lacking. As one character remarks in the movie, you cannot quite top Gru's out-of-this-world scheme of stealing the moon; and for that matter, neither does Gru's tale of falling in love quite match the same poignancy and sweet-natured charm of his coming-into-fatherhood story the last time round.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"Besides a string of jokes, both adult and juvenile, the best moments in Despicable me 2 are when we get to see minions indulge in screwball mischief.","Whenever a sequel is announced, it is safe to assume that filmmakers are coming after your money in an attempt to milk the success of the original film. From a movie patron's perspective, there is always a risk of being victimized should pre-ordained expectations go south. This risk is amplified when returning viewers expect an equal or greater experience in comparison. While not quite as unique as the 2010 original, I am happy to report that Despicable Me 2 is an equally entertaining encore, just as long as your expectations are tethered to a stick of Acme dynamite. Yes; dynamite.Returning directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud have brought along few tricks that are seamlessly blended into the visual quality of this animation. And of course, the use of 3D is one of them. That being said, the real treats come from returning screenwriters Ken Daurio and Cino Paul, by injecting the story with heavy doses of the most likable aspects from the predecessor — adorability and hilarity. The story is also altered where Gru (Steve Carell) is now a fervent father to his three adopted girls Margo, Edith, and Agnes, having abandoned his villainous ways of the past. But when new super-villain El Macho (Benjamin Bratt) threatens to turn Gru's lovable minions into aggressive monsters, the latter is recruited by the ""Anti-Villain League"", a secret agency whose only purpose is detecting and eliminating super-villains. All of a sudden, Gru is back to juggling again — this time as a hero and an overprotective father, while actually falling for AVL colleague and sidekick Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig).For a spy-spoof animation, the story does not do much to hide its high level of predictability. Instead, the screenwriters have clearly focused on slapstick gags that are well written for viewers of all ages. There are several references to heist and spy movies that adults will mentally tick off to, while kids and toddlers are more than likely to get off to a rollicking ride from the start. Making this possible are zany new characters that add extra pizazz with plenty of loony-toon moments. One such character is Bratt's El Macho, a two faced super-villain with a psychotic chicken for a side-kick and a son that steals Margo's heart from right under Gru's nose. And while Carell's Gru takes a backseat as a reformed villain, Wiig's Lucy brings out a wacky side of Gru that is straight out of the Acme crate I had mentioned earlier. But amongst the various characters and voice talents at work, nothing can prepare you for the incredibly adorable Agnes (Elsie Fisher). Also returning from her debut role in Despicable Me, Fisher's voice acting is the essence of cuteness each and every time her character is on screen.Besides a string of jokes, both adult and juvenile, the best moments in the film are when we get to see Gru's minions indulge in screwball mischief, including singing pop music with a French twist. These are also the moments when 3D is at its intentional best, so stick around for the end credits where minions audition for their 2015 movie spin-off called The Minions. But before we get there, I recommend Despicable Me 2 for the loads of fun, joy and laughter it has in store. It is easily one of the funniest animated films of the year.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Wildly Entertaining!,"""That's right, baby! Gru's back in the game with cool cars... gadgets... and weapons!""There might not be that much of an interesting story in this sequel, but I have to admit I had a blast with these lovable characters and laughed throughout the entire movie. I don't think I laughed as much with any other movie all year so I have to say this is the funniest film of the year so far. It has several clever lines and I was glad to see all these memorable characters back. Once again the minions steal the show along with Agnes who is as adorable as ever. There were also some new characters that brought some freshness to the sequel. I can understand why some adults might not have liked this film because it is predictable and has some very stupid moments, but I know kids will have a great time. They will love this sequel because the minions have more screen time and they steal the funniest scenes. I couldn't help but laugh at all the funny and adorable situation, and perhaps hearing the kids laugh at the theater made me appreciate the comedy even more. This is a very family friendly film which reminded me a lot of the old comedy from the Looney Tunes. I could sit through this film many more times without hesitating because it is a very easy watch. I think I'd even prefer to see this over the first Despicable Me, but they were both great and funny films.In this sequel we see how Gru (Steve Carell) is adapting to family life as he has put his villainous life behind him. He seems to be enjoying his life as a single parent to Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier), and Agnes (Elsie Kate Fisher). Everything seems to be going well for him as he has his minions working on a jam business. Meanwhile a secret Arctic lab has been stolen and the Anti-Villain League decide to contact Gru for his expertise in order to catch the person responsible. After recruiting Gru they team him up with Agent Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig) and together they begin to look for suspects. Gru is convinced that the villain is Eduardo (Benjamin Bratt), who used to disguise himself as the villain known as El Macho, but he has been presumed dead for years. During their investigation, Gru's minions are being kidnapped, and the question remains as to who is the person behind all this.I really enjoyed the animation from the guys at Illumination Entertainment and thought the 3D worked nicely. I really loved the underwater scene and thought it was really breathtaking. There were some great animated moments, but the lovable minions are the ones that steal the show with their funny voices and mischiefs.

EXCELLENT movie..... BUT something was very concerning,"This movie was excellent but....Let me start off by saying: I am not the type of person to be easily offended by anything but there was a part of the film that made my friend and I very comfortable. It seemed very awkward and the whole theater was thrown off by it. Violence against women is not funny and should not be in a movie rated for young viewers. I'm not upset about this at all but it made the rest of the movie a little awkward.. almost as if making you wonder if someone was angry at an ex-girlfriend and decided to make this scene to spite her.I won't give anything away but the scene I am talking about involves a young women dressed in leopard print with a lot of makeup on. Her character is superficial and annoying. Long story short, she ends up being drugged while out on a date and then her limp body is tossed around and violated in a violent way (an awkward few minutes that seemed like an eternity)until she ends up face down tossed onto her front steps at the end of the night. I found it inappropriate to expose young children to that sort of behavior. I could understand if it was some sort of magic weapon used against her or something completely made up.. but drugging a woman and then violating her limp body is not something I would want to expose my children to.Just a thought. Other than that the movie way awesome. Definitely would not take my children to see it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
It Killed 2 Hours,"How is this one the highest grossing animated films of all time? Why does it have a 7.6 on IMDb? What's so universal about dumb, whacky yellow henchman to the human psyche? Despicable Me is so average, even when compared to the original, which at least tried.Despicable Me was about a misunderstood evil villain, and his misadventures as a single father. Despicable Me 2 doesn't have themes beyond its adventure. Side characters from the original are missing or reduced to cameos. Gru is no longer a villain. His single father issues are trite. The lone development in this film is Gru's romantic relationship. Its typically cartoonish, with little romantic chemistry.At least the movie is funny. The characters are outrageous and often engage in slapstick. If you like what you've seen of the minions, you'll probably like the film's humor.Its a decent rental, if you're just looking for laughs. You don't need to watch the first.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
I'd rate this film on about the same level as the first.,"'DESPICABLE ME 2': Three Stars (Out of Five)Sequel to the 2010 hit animated film about an evil criminal mastermind named Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) working with an army of minions in a plot to steal the moon. He has a change of heart when he befriends three orphan girls. The sequel begins with Gru now a family man, raising the three girls, and working as a legitimate businessman trying to produce jam. That all changes when he's recruited by the Anti-Villain league to help stop a new powerful supervillain. The film was once again directed by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud and written by Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio. It features the voice talents of Russell Brand and Miranda Cosgrove, reprising their roles from the original film, and Kristen Wiig and Ken Jeong are back as well (but playing different, bigger parts than they did in the first film). Steve Coogan joins the cast this time as well and Benjamin Bratt voices the main villain (who was originally voiced by Al Pacino but he dropped out of the film because of 'creative differences'). The movie is about as clever and amusing as the first; if you enjoyed that film you're almost sure to enjoy this one as well.The film opens with the theft of a secret Arctic laboratory (by a flying vehicle using a magnet). A chemical, which mutates ordinary animals into viscous killing creatures, was inside the lab so naturally the Anti-Villain league (AVL) is concerned. They turn to Gru (Carell) for help. AVL agent Lucy Wilde (Wiig) abducts Gru from his home and transports him to the secret underwater AVL base. Once there Gru meets the AVL league director, Silas Ramsbottom (Coogan), who informs him of the laboratory heist and asks him for his help catching the supervillain responsible for it. Gru initially rejects their request but later decides to help the AVL after all. He's teamed with Agent Wilde and of course romance blossoms.The movie (like the original) captures that old style cartoon feel well. It was made on a budget of just $76 million. Compared to other big animated films that's pretty low and compared to how much money it's making that makes it a hugely profitable film (like the first)! Do I think it deserves it's humongous blockbuster success? No but I don't think any of the kids' animated films out today like this do. This one is at least better than average; It's funny (at times) and Carell and the rest of the cast are good in their parts. The minions are a little too gimmicky for me but they're funny at times as well. I'd rate this film on about the same level as the first, I'd have to watch the original again to say if it's better (because I don't completely remember it) but it's definitely a decent crowd pleasing sequel.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n28SgCY6lwc",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Good fun,"Sweet, feel-good movie. Quite predicable and not laugh-a-minute funny, and mostly quite empty for the middle section of the movie, it has a good heart and finished strongly. Probably more a kids movie than an adults movie though.Thus, very similar to the first Despicable Me: good start, drifts a lot in the middle, finishes strongly with some nice emotional touches.Animation is great, as expected. The choices of the voice stars is spot- on. Steve Carell steals the show, of course, but the remainder are good too.Not a classic, but good fun nevertheless.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Better than the first!,"Generally I am not a fan of sequels. Specifically the sequels to kids movies tend to just get dumber and dumber. Definitely NOT the case with Despicable Me 2. My husband & myself (30), our 3 kids (4, 6 & 8), my parents (in their 50's) and my little sister (21) all went to see this on the 4th of July b/c our park pans were rained out. We ALL laughed from the first minute to the last. It honestly starts off hilarious and just keeps the jokes coming the whole time. Another thing I liked about this one was that there were 2 scenes that had the adults laughing hysterically, that the kids didn't quite get. It was nice that it wasn't 100% aimed at the kids, so no matter the age everyone in the theater was laughing the whole time.It was nice to see Gru as a great dad being responsible and fun, and it was nice to see him with a love interest. The girls are growing up a little so that was really cute to see and to see how Gru is reacting to that. My favorite thing about this one though, was that the Minions had such a BIG part. Half of the laughs were because of them which was great.I would HIGHLY recommend seeing this one ASAP! (Though, you could probably skip the 3D aspect).",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Despicable Me 2 lacks more original proposals, which go beyond what was already seen in the first film, to guarantee the interest of a wider range of the audience","In mid-2010, the animation studio Ilumination Entertainment arrived in Hollywood with the great animation Despicable Me. It was a fun and well-produced business card that showed that the new company was not reaching one of the most competitive markets in the world just to make numbers. You could already see in the feature a good knowledge of cinema as a business and the audience they wanted to reach: the whole family. The commercial potential of the franchise was obvious, especially for the friendly and clumsy minions. Therefore, a sequel was commissioned, with the pairs of directors and writers of the original (Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud and Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul, respectively) returning to their posts, seeking to replicate the success of that film. Thus, this ""Despicable Me 2"" was born.Former villain Gru, having embraced his role as father of the little girls Margo, Edith and Agnes, now faces the problems and joys that come with parenting. But when a new supervillain emerges, the former villain is recruited by a secret agency to meet him among shopkeepers at a mall in his city. To help, agent Lucy Wild is brought in, who conquers Gru's daughters and awakens in him a romanticism that he himself had forgotten. Of course, in the middle of the main plot, which still involves a Latin criminal known as El Macho, we still have Gru's minions ready for their mess, and then they are brought to the central plot.Continuing Gru's evolution towards becoming a better person thanks to the influence of his daughters, the production references successes that range from the 007 series (in his extravagant antagonist and the exotic-named girl) to ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" (something curious, as Steve Carell does the voice of Gru in the original version). But, unlike less rated films, such references to pop culture do not take over the tape, which remains interested in its own characters, something that can be credited to the maintenance of the writers of the first feature. If the first animation showed the bad guy getting in touch with a side of himself that he didn't even know existed, in the sequence Gru is no longer the greatest villain in the world, and now he spends his time taking care of his three adopted daughters and trying to arrive, with the help of his army of tiny yellow creatures, to the formula of the perfect fruit jelly.Gru is also, for the first time questioned about the love that is haunting him due to an experience of the past in his days at school. Love is a central theme for the story this time. It's not just Gru, but the eldest daughter, Margo, also experiences the adrenaline rush of falling in love. Even Dave (a Minion), one of Gru's many servants, falls in love. This theme of love is what defines this sequence. We have a number of new characters now. The first of these is Lucy Wilde, the orange-haired woman who works for L. A. V and eventually becomes Gru's love interest. Her funny actions and hyperactive behavior make her a fantastic addition to the wide range of vibrant characters here. There is also Silas Bundósvisky, the leader of AVL. The final addition to the list of characters is Eduardo Perez, owner of a Mexican restaurant, whose real identity provokes him to say: ""it is nothing more than it appears.""With Gru having accepted his role as a father figure in the previous chapter, the logical step to take with him would be to introduce him to dilemmas with which the adult audience can identify, doing so that children understand and have fun, something that the film gets. Gru's relationship with Lucy further humanizes the protagonist, not being forced into the plot, however the character Lucy is irritating. Empathy with the female character is very difficult due to her lines and exacerbated movements, perhaps the audience will start to like her only at the end of the film. To try to increase the plot, Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) gets a boyfriend and Agnes (Elsie Fisher) wants to have a mother, complicating Gru's difficulty in dealing with women. These situations give more grace and bring a freshness to the boring main plot. I do not quote Edith (Dana Gaier), the middle daughter, because she was simply forgotten by the writers.The insertions of the minions during the projection serve to create moments of pure relaxation. As much as they sometimes appear disconnected from the rest of the tape, it is impossible to deny that the little creatures are really funny and charismatic, fulfilling their basic function of making people laugh. The plot involving the villain and his evil plans ends up being thrown aside. The main antagonist proves to be very uninteresting and not even his adoration for Gru's previous works is taken advantage of by the script. Even the chicken that Gru and Lucy face in the middle of the tape is more striking.Another resource used is the girl Agnes, the cuteness in person that won everyone over on the first tape. Here the directors use and abuse the cuteness of the little girl, creating some purposefully exciting moments that take everyone by heart. It is a stark emotional cheating of the filmmakers for several moments.Using a formula to subvert expectations that since The Addams Family (the series is from 1964) has been working satisfactorily, Despicable Me 2 lacks more original proposals, which go beyond what was already seen in the first film of the series, to guarantee the interest of a wider range of the audience. As it stands, the simple plot, without major twists, and the shallow characters, with no more elaborate objectives, should please only the little ones, and look there. Such a plot is cluttered, takes a long time to walk and, when it does, it happens in an uninteresting way, without creativity, choosing lazy and boring resolutions. And it is always interrupted by predictable and exaggerated jokes, in addition to the fact that there are completely unnecessary subplots that do not take the film anywhere. As an example, one can cite the resolutions of the scenes in which Gru and Lucy sneak into Eduardo's restaurant (Benjamin Bratt), or when the two try to enter a merchant's store hidden in garbage cans, or even later at the party of Eduardo. Such situations are resolved abruptly. We still have to accompany the older sister's supposed first love and the search for a girlfriend for Gru, as in that dreadful scene in which he is having dinner with a paunch.In addition, the jokes are weak, sometimes investing in a physical mood without a hint of resourcefulness or shaming the bar in a shameful way when, for example, you create a character by the name of Silas Bundovski, or even when you shout the jokes, underlining the motifs with falsetto and grimaces, as Lucy's character does the entire film. Another problem is that the film has flaws in the construction of some characters. The biggest one, of course, is Gru's. If in the first film the character was undergoing a mushy and forced transformation, in the second his alleged villainy does not even appear. He is a bad guy who has nothing bad, he has become a good guy, a cute, considerate guy, who wants good things to win, and who loves his little girls with all his heart. Even his supposed sullenness is put aside, composing a character who is not even an anti-hero, but the good guy with all his undeniable qualities. Removing the protagonist from his natural habitat also takes away a good part of his grace. If Gru's sarcastic humor prevailed in the first feature, here the type of joke used includes showing him dressed as an enchanted princess to please his daughter.The production design of the film invests in rounded lines and in a suitably cartoonish and caricatural tone. However, just as the villain is not well used, the scenarios referring to this one are also not, being extremely generic. 3D, on the other hand, only shows what came during the credits, impressing in the crazy things involving the minions in preparation for the future solo yellow film, but with technology being little used during the film itself.The duo Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud presents us with some very creative sequences, as is the case of the moment when Gru walks down the street in love and, after a romantic disappointment, makes the same way back. In addition, the filmmakers finish this scene in a simple but bright way, showing him sitting on the porch of the house, in the rain, in a totally gray environment, and when the door opens (as his daughter comes to bring him a guard rain), a warm yellow light comes out of the house and illuminates it. By making direct mentions of the original (the pancake format), in addition to quotes from classic films (the reference to Alien involving a rooster is hilarious), Despicable Me 2 manages to entertain without much commitment, but not as much as the previous one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Great Animated Fun,"There isn't much to be said about Despicable Me 2 besides that it is great animated fun. When I say that it sounds bland but its because it is practically the same film as the first Despicable Me 2, only with a more light and fun atmosphere. It really does have the same plot and types of twists. I don;t think this is a bad thing though because I see the Despicable Me franchise as a throwback to what old cartoons really mean, which is to provide over the top fun for the sole reason of laughter. But in Despicable Me, it also mixes in some true heart. I could really see the Despicable Me franchise turning into a big series and I would be right along with it due to the fact that the two movies so far are some of the only animated films I have laughed at in a while, and one scene from the second may possibly be the funniest scene in a movie in 2013. I just think the only problem with this sequel is that it copies a lot of the content from the first so it is hard to connect and feel with some of the emotion presented in its flawless predecessor. Not to say it doesn't have heart be cause it does, but it doesn't come in as much of abundance because most of the characters are already developed and some of the side stories of underdeveloped characters are a tad lousy, such as the father-daughter aspects. I think this side story was a little weaker than it could have been and it didn't really tie up in the end. I like the mother-daughter elements better, those were spot on.But overall Despicable Me 2 is a great animated movie that people of all ages can enjoy. I don't think you really need to see it in the theaters because unfortunately it's 3D isn't as good as it could have been, and the visuals do not compare to other animated films such as Pixar (that doesn't make the movie lesser though since it doesn't rely on visuals, just the screenplay). So I would say it is must see on a rental.Grade: B+",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

MY REVIEW: A Despicable Experience for DM1 Lovers!!,"Despicable Me 2. After the high popularity of wonderful Despicable Me, it was expected that they will push the envelope again but disappointing that sequel was written and directed just to cash in the charm of original's characters and lovely minions. After Gru has turned good, writers just do not know what he shall do. New villain and side characters are so one dimensional and boring. Only real fun you have is from minions. It just lacked the sharpness of original. If you haven't seen the original, you might like it but for who have seen the original and adore it are just going to feel that huge potential was wasted. I am going with generous 7 out of 10 for Despicable Me 2. It's not great fun like the original but not a complete let down either.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"Less focused then the original, but still a good time","The first Despicable Me, though not up to Pixar in the CGI world, was above all Dreamworks films bar Kung Fu Panda and How To Train Your Dragon, way above anything from Blu Sky or Sony, and better then most of Disney's CGI features. Illumination Entertainment seemed to be one to watch. Their next film, Hop, was a disaster, but it was a live-action one they merely contributed animation to, so it was easy to ignore. Then, The Lorax was typical market-tested, drawn-out stuff, leaving the company with a one-in-three ratio of success thus far.Now, with Despicable Me 2, they have partially restored my faith. Therein lies the movie's problem. It is PARTIALLY better then the original, both in terms of a few element,s and snippets and scenes here and there. But when looking at both as a whole, the first is obviously better. Why? The element or surprise, probably, and Despicable Me 2 is otherwise the best animated film so far this year (in the UK, comparing it to Croods and Epic; Monsters University has not been released here yet).The plot is attracting stuff. Gru, having had his villain heart softened by the trio of adopted girls, now lives a much more peaceful life. Right around the time that his colleague Dr. Nefario leaves to work for another villain, making Gru question his currently tepid life, he is hauled - literally - away to the Anti-Villain League, where he is recruited to ""go undercover and save the world,"" as he puts it.Viewed with my critical glasses on, the film is riddled with problems, and I'm not even leaving the viewpoint of a average moviegoer. It is never quite as epic an adventure movie as one would want it to be (though this is not nearly as notable as it was with Monsters Vs Aliens). The characters are also just not as interesting as before. Don't get me wrong - Gru is as amusing and mean-when-required as ever, and Carell remains top-notch, but his one attractive hook - he's a villain - is missing (suffice to say, the biggest laughs with him are when flashes of it shine through). And the third act is rushed up too fast, as though the production schedule din't allow for a proper showdown.There is one shining factor that is undoubtedly improved - the humor. Even when there is little going on plot-wise to interest, there is always a plentiful supply of gags, and for both groups - for every minion snippet, there is a Indiana Jones spoof. One thing I am certain of is that this one will not hold up to repeat viewings nearly as well as the first, due to the fact that the jokes are the highlights.As a result, I'm torn between 6/10 and 7/10. The one finds Gru less interesting because of what made the first film's ending so sweet, while the other had a good time, and came out smiling. And the ratio of missed gags to hit gags is a safer one then the first (where we had to deal with the annoying Vector and more bit-part celebrity voices then this one). And the minions themselves are pivotal this time around, for a plot point I won't spoil, in a ticket-worthy nod to Invasion Of The Body Snatchers (they have a safe mix of adult gags, kid gags, and everyone gags).With all that, I'm going to give Despicable Me a 7/10. Still of of the better films so far this year.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"When the world needed a hero, they called a villain.","The first movie Despicable Me (2010) not only was a very good movie and was successful, but it was also the first animated movie from the animation studio Illumination that got it to be as well-known as it is today; the sequel Despicable Me 2 (2013) that came out three years later after the first was a very good and entertaining follow-up. The sequel Despicable Me 2 (2013) was funny and entertaining to watch with well-done animation, great voice acting, effective emotional moments, and fun action involving Gru, Lucy, and the minions; there is a little side plot going on at the same time as the main plot, but it was funny enough to be fine for the movie, with the minions obviously being for the kids and bringing the childish humor to the film.Steve Carell still does a wonderful job voicing Gru making the character a funny and likable character, with him being recruited into the Anti Villain League and him working with AVL agent Lucy when looking for a certain serum used in a plot from another villain; I like how Gru takes on the role of being an agent for a secret team while taking care of his three daughters, and the three girls Margo, Edith, and Agnes voiced again by Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier, and Elsie Fisher who are all funny and there is some kind of side plot going on with Agnes, but they are still likable and entertaining with Gru being a protective parent at times. Gru's new partner Lucy voiced by Russell Kristen Wiig was a funny character and I liked seeing her and Gru work together and build chemistry with one another when they are going on certain missions to find a serum the agency is looking for, and how they can seem like opposites by the way they act; also, at the same time Gru's minions mysteriously disappear because of a plan being put together from the actual main villain, which can be funny, and the minions themselves can be funny despite being there for immature childish humor.The main villain that Gru tries to prove to the agency that he is still around, which is big reveal on who it is, so no spoilers but I will say he is voiced well by Benjamin Bratt; he is a funny, who does use and steal Gru's minions for a certain plan he has been working on for years, while also just trying to have Gru join him because of the last movie. The 3D animation is well-done, the minions are funny in the scenes they are in, and the action scenes are fun to watch; the look of Gru's lab and gadgets are cool along with the look of the AVL tech and headquarters, but also that the weapons used are cool when used on people; the movie does go more into a spy movie, and I liked that direction it was heading. Also, there are some songs by Pharrell Williams that are nice to listen to, along with there being quite a few heartfelt moments between Gru and the three girls or Gru and Lucy when Gru is being a protective father and building a relationship with Lucy.The sequel Despicable Me 2 (2013) is as enjoyable and entertaining to watch as the first, because it has well-done 3D animation, quite a few funny moments and memorable lines of dialogue, and incredibly good voice acting; Illumination still did an excellent job with this movie, though it is not a perfect animated movie, it is still fun to watch for both animation fans and families. This movie is worth watching and rewatching like the first, with this being a good sequel to a movie that got this animation studio started; a great follow-up to a great animated movie that I recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
More Minions only helps this wonderful sequel.,"Minions. They are everywhere. The popularity of these crazy little yellow things is running crazy and helping Despicable Me 2 smash the box office on the way, and for a good reason. They make Despicable Me 2 what it is: a hilarious, fun, and entertaining sequel to one of my favorite animated films of recent time.Don't get me wrong, the delightful Minions aren't the only thing that make the movie a joy to watch. The main (human) cast of characters return headed by funny man Steve Carell, reprising his role of now loving father and ex-villain, Gru. Carell's voice once again brings Gru to life and makes him simply hilarious. Aside from those Minions, Gru is the best and funniest character in the movie, delivering jokes for kids all ages and a couple of those under toned jokes for the adults. Along with Gru, Margo, Edith, and the oh so cute and funny Agnes return as the adopted daughters of Gru, though their roles are less than the first movie. Russel Brand returns to voice Dr. Nefario, who has few parts but once again adds nicely to the mix, and Kristen Wiig comes along to act as a love interest in the form of Lucy, who is funny at times, but also has her not-so-funny moments. But even with this great cast, they all are side stepped by the real show stoppers. The Minions.The first Despicable Me, released in 2010, was an enormous hit, and to Universal's delight, spawned a new pop culture phenomenon in the Minions. While the first movie was fantastic, people wanted more Minions, and in Despicable Me 2, they answered the call. These wacky hilarious goof balls pop up in almost every scene of the movie and provide all kinds of laughs. Whether they're beating each other to a pulp, dressing up and playing make-believe, or cracking jokes and laughing about butts and farts, the Minions are just plain old fun to watch. They also play a much larger role in the overall story this time around, becoming subjects to main villain El Macho's (Benjamin Bratt) evil tests. To state it again, the Minions steal the show, and without them, Despicable Me wouldn't be half as popular as it is.There really isn't too much more to say about this movie. The story was fun and provided a good mystery, but for older viewers such as myself, was pretty easy to figure out. Gru acts as a member of the Anti-Villain League, setting the stage for spy missions, as well as some action scenes, and they provide fun entertainment aside from the antics of the Minions.Kids will love this movie inside and out. It is a very visually engaging film, it's very funny, goofy, and has those bits of action and mystery in it, not to mention again the Minions. Adults and older viewers should find just about the same joy in the movie, it's cute and provides jokes and funny moments that someone of any age can enjoy. Despicable Me 2 is a more than worthy sequel that gave fans what the asked for, and what the makes the movie great. Minions, Minions and more Minions!9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"A Fun, Lovable Sequel with Plenty of Minion Madness","Despicable Me 2 (2013), directed by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud, continues the story of Gru, the former supervillain turned loving dad, as he faces a new adventure full of laughs, action, and, of course, Minions. While it doesn't quite reach the emotional depth of the first film, this sequel delivers a delightful and hilarious experience for fans of the original.Pros:
Gru's Evolution: Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) is as charming as ever. This time, we see him adjusting to life as a single dad while also navigating the world of espionage. His character development continues to be engaging, especially as he explores the possibility of romance with his new partner, Lucy.Lucy Wilde: Kristen Wiig's Lucy Wilde is a fantastic addition to the cast. Her quirky, energetic personality brings a fresh dynamic to the story, and her budding relationship with Gru adds a sweet layer to the film.The Minions Shine: The Minions take center stage with more screen time and their own hilarious subplot. Their slapstick humor and adorable antics are as entertaining as ever, and their misadventures are a highlight of the movie.Family and Heart: While the sequel leans more on comedy than the emotional core of the first film, it still has heartwarming moments, particularly the scenes involving Gru and his daughters. Agnes's unshakable belief in Gru's goodness remains a standout.Action and Spy Gadgets: The film embraces its spy theme with fun gadgets, imaginative set pieces, and colorful action sequences. The creative blend of humor and action keeps the movie lively and engaging.Visuals and Music: The vibrant animation is even more polished in this sequel, and Pharrell Williams's music, including the hit song ""Happy,"" adds a cheerful energy to the film.Cons:
Less Emotional Depth: While the movie is undeniably fun, it doesn't quite capture the same emotional weight as the first installment. The focus on humor and action sometimes overshadows the story's heartfelt moments.Simpler Plot: The story is more straightforward and less nuanced than the original. The villain, El Macho, is amusing but lacks the complexity and memorable presence of Gru in the first film.Minion Overload: While the Minions are delightful, some viewers might feel their increased focus comes at the expense of the main storyline.Conclusion:
Despicable Me 2 is a worthy sequel that builds on the charm and humor of the original while introducing fun new characters and scenarios. While it lacks the emotional depth of the first film, it more than makes up for it with laughs, action, and heartwarming moments. It's a joyful, family-friendly adventure that's sure to entertain audiences of all ages. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"It May Sound Odd, But I'm Disappointed","I'm not expecting high art when it comes to a ""Despicable Me"" Movie. This isn't a Pixar, Studio Ghibli or Liaka film, it is an Illumination Movie. Just turn your brain off and have a good time. But even with that in mind, this movie fell short for me. I mean the film was nominated for 2 Oscars and made north of $900 million dollars at the worldwide box office, you think it should produce more than a ""meh"" from me.I watched ""Despicable Me 2"" with 4 kids ages 4-10. After the first 10 minutes, I didn't hear a single laugh from any of them. At the 80-minute mark I was being asked when the movie was going to end. It is a bad sign when a comedy fails to entertain its target demographic.The movie has great voice actors doing funny voices, but not saying anything all that funny. They have both Kristen Wiig and Kristen Schaal, how can those two not be funny? They just weren't given very good material to work with.On a story telling level there is a lot that doesn't add up. Plot points and timelines feel disjointed, one action does not organically lead to the next. Story beats are abandoned, and solutions are pulled out of nowhere. The film lacks a certain energy. A lot of it takes place either in the mall or at the girls' house. It just has this leisurely pace for the story beats, which soon bored the younger kids.What I think this film does well, and why people keep coming back is for the characters. I do think Gru works well off of the 3 girls, the agent and I liked the new villain more than the previous film. I also think that the soundtrack for this film is really great.At the end of the day, you can probably tell from the trailers whether this is the film for you. I think it is perfectly fine, not great but not despicable to me.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Despicable Me 2 has tonnes of cuteness, but little else...","We went to watch this film together in a group of about 20 people. It was a midnight screening, and after a long day (we were in a training camp), I had expect the film to entertain and cheer us all up.Unfortunately halfway into the film, many of us were pretty bored by the relatively lack of interesting plot lines.The characters, other than being very cute, have little else. I don't really feel for them. It's like they lack real depth in their characters and personalities. There are just too many minions in the film, in the end they will all appear as ""that little cute yellow thing"".To me, the main problem with this film is that many of the punchlines are fairly predictable, we aren't really laughing out that much throughout the film. It depends way too much on sheer cuteness of the minions, and also the over-the-top, exaggerated character animations or actions. It lacks genuine comedy wit, and cuteness can only do so much.It's not that just guys find that the movies fairly disappointing, many of the girls felt the same way as well.It's a nice movie, but just don't put too much expectation on it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Cute romance,"A good sequel with another cute story about Gru, but this time about his romantic front. It's exciting, and as always, the animation is great, both the colors and the technological motions. I think Despicable Me (2010) is slightly better because it has a little deeper and better story, but anyway, recommending!",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Despicable Me 2 maintains the colourful animation and zany characters from its predecessor, but loses memorability.","If you've been reading my reviews like a good follower, you'll know I'm not a fan of Illumination studios. A mass marketing animation group who clearly milked the first successful film they created. And here we are with its sequel. Gru is recruited by the 'Anti Villain League' to stop an evil villain from unleashing a serum that turns anything into a weird monster-like purple maniac. Meanwhile, his adopted girls try to play matchmaker and find him a girlfriend. A consistent sequel is one would ask for, and fortunately we received it. Returning cast members, directors and script writers resulted in a perfectly good animation that all the family can enjoy. Well...somewhat enjoy. This main plot is unfocussed in comparison to the first instalment, trying to balance a ""save the world"" situation with kindling a romance did not always work effectively. The two plots occasionally blended but the main plot seemed to be the love story as opposed to the former which ultimately left me underwhelmed. The villain was memorable atleast albeit his world domination plan was underdeveloped. Steve Carrell and the returning voice actors clearly had fun, and I consistently smile when he says ""girls""...it's more like ""guuurlz!"". Kristen Wiig was a welcomed newcomer and a definite highlight to this sequel. The animation was fluid, vibrant and always colourful. At times, the film felt like a music video for all of Pharrell Williams' songs, and if I have to hear 'Happy' one more time I will shove a minion up Illumination's...*cough* you get the idea. The minions provide slapstick humour aimed more towards the younger viewers, they are still annoying as ever hoisting fart guns and singing songs incomprehensibly but what can you do...just go with it. Liked the countless film references, a minion screaming and pointing reminiscent of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' did make me smile. A fun light watch that is no where near as good as the first.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Love is a dangerous mission ...even for a villain,"Contains no spoilersLife has certainly changed for Gru (Steve Carell) since the first Despicable Me (2010). He's now a respectable family man as well as eligible single father on his block which has a nosy neighbor and his daughters pushing him into the dating pool. Instead of devising plots to take over the world, he and thousands of minions along with Dr. Nefario try to corner the market in jelly making. Yes, life has definitely changed for Gru ...or has it in the sequel, Despicable Me 2? In this movie, Gru faces a larger challenge than being recruited by AVL (Anti-Villain League) for a mission. It's juggling the challenge of falling in love and handling your eldest daughter's sudden interest in boys at the same time. This reviewer can certainly relate.She enjoyed how the writers delicately handled the adult theme and complexities of Gru's falling head over heels for his fellow AVL agent Lucy (Kristen Wiig) without it being done overly dramatic or over the top that the kids would find too gross for them to enjoy the movie. It was handled in way even some of younger viewers could understand and laugh at the goofy things we adults go through when trying to ask a woman out on a date. There is one scene within Despicable Me 2 that fully explains why Gru has a difficult time meeting women that got plenty of laughs from all ages. Nice to see that the cooties joke is still popular with kids today. On the flip side, what's a kid's movie today without the occasional fart joke (as if this movie needed 23 to prove how funny they are)? *sighs* They may be funny but didn't generate much laughs from this reviewer's daughter ...perhaps she wasn't the target age group for that.Also this reviewer liked the movies unique notion that villains are hiding amongst us including hatching evil plans inside our local malls like Eduardo/El Macho (Benjamin Bratt) who's son has caught the eye of Gru's eldest daughter. This sets up a the funny situation where Gru becomes the over protective father and then comforter when she experiences her first heartache. However, it's the minions that really keep this movie afloat and mostly funny especially when they insert iconic 70s nostalgia (i.e. YMCA and yes, there was a parent who actually embarrassed their kids with the infamous hand movements in the theater) to include the adult/parent viewer within the plot of Despicable Me 2. A word of caution - the intense scenes featuring the mutated purple minions might be a little too scary for viewers under 4. They did make a few kids cry .Overall, Despicable Me 2 is a fairly decent family movie that kids of all ages can enjoy . Don't leave when the credits roll at the end of the movie or you might miss the funny extras!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
I don't get the hype..,"Literally the only thing my whole group of friends could do after the movie was stare at each other and wonder what we just saw. It was funny at times, yes. But the plot was lacking in originality. Most of the supposedly funny parts were more like annoying attempts to being funny, but not really succeeding. The new woman character was nowhere near appealing and flat out unlikable. Pretty disappointing. I have no idea how this gets anywhere above a 6. I usually don't rate movies, but I really felt like I wasted my money on this one. A lot of minion action but I feel like it might have been too much. The ending was just disappointing... I feel like they could have made it a lot more thrilling but it was way too predictable. There wasn't much of a buildup of a plot, and the way they solved the problem was just too easy. There was inconsistency and some more inappropriate scenes that would require some explanation for kids.. I don't know. This movie was definitely one I wouldn't waste my time and money on. Much rather just watch the first one again.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A barrel of laughs,"I loved the first movie a lot, so when I heard they were making a sequel I was worried it would follow the faith of so many before it. Thankfully, Im happy to say it didn't. Not only did it keep in spirit with the first one, they didn't spoil all the jokes in the trailers and I couldn't stop laughing all the way. True, it's easy to guess the ending, but honestly, how else were they going to the moment we saw Lucy. The minions were great, Agnes was great, Gruu was great... a lot of it was great. Only complaint would be that Edith didn't play a very big role in this one either as it focused more on the love fracture and the fatherly relationship between Gruu and the girls. Regardless it was a great movie, worth supporting and worth watching.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Gru and his minions are back for an amazing and laugh out loud sequel!,"Despicable Me 2 is a masterpiece of a film, there I said it. The 2013 summer comedy has really surpassed my expectations, especially since it's from the widely negatively received French animation studio Illumination, the film has a great story, great music, great music, great visuals, just about everything about this film is great.Let's talk about the story of the film. The story revolves around a now retired villain Gru (played by Steve Carrel) as he struggles to provide for his family. One afternoon, Gru and two of his minions get kidnapped and offered a position at the Anti Villain League. Gru denies the offer at first but then joins after his long term partner and friend Dr. Nefario (played by Russel Brand) leaves his team. Gru now must work with the energetic Lucy (played by Kristen Wigg) to find out who is the criminal mastermind behind a theft that could end humanity. That's not all Gru has to worry about , Gru now has the responsibility of taking care of his children, Margo, Edith, and Agnus and also to find out why his hilarious army of minions are dropping mysteriously by the day.I really enjoyed the story of Despicable Me 2. It's super creative and fun but also invokes a ton of mystery. There are two major plots in this movie, the spy plot and the romance plot. Both plots mash together super well and the film spends the perfect amount of time on both plots so one doesn't feel underdeveloped. I also really love the villain of this movie and his motive. I'm not gonna spoil who he is but he is hilarious and threatening at the same time. The animation is a major upgrade from the first Despicable Me and it's absolutely beautiful. It's super colorful and realistic but not too realistic where the cartoony designs of the characters breaks the immersion. The minions this time around are central to the plot as it brilliantly ties in with the plan that Gru and Lucy are trying to crack. The minions are show stealers this time around as they should be. They are loyal and are always ready to help out, not to mention that they are insanely funny. The girls are also handled well in the sequel, they get plenty of screen time and don't feel rushed and forced in the film. The worst part of this film is its humor, while still funny, it's mainly now fart jokes. So the film can feel immature at times. Also, there's a side plot about Margo dating a boy that Gru doesn't like. It really doesn't go anyway and feels like filler to extend the runtime.Overall, Despicable Me 2 is one of the best animated movies of the 2010's decade. It has integrity and executes its bold and creative ideas in a perfect fashion. It's a must see for any animation fan or someone looking for a good action and comedy movie! You really out did yourself illumination!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A fun sequel for the whole family!,"Despicable Me 2 continues with the story of ex criminal Gru(Steve Carell), who is now living the domestic dad life & focusing more on his jam/jelly business. Soon however, Lucy(Kristen Wiig) of the Anti-Villain League, recruits Gru to stop a new criminal who is injecting a serum into animals which turn them into indestructible killing machines.This was an extremely funny & entertaining film. Gru's minions were hilarious as ever! The 3D was spectacular. A note on the voice acting. Steve Carell was outstanding as Gru. I love that weird accent that Gru talks in. Kristen Wiig was great as Lucy. Benjamin Bratt was spectacular as Eduardo/El Macho. Miranda Cosgrove was impressive as Margo. Dana Gaier was effective as Edith. Elsie Kate Fisher was adorable as Agnes. Agnes was the cutest character in the film. Russell Brand & Ken Jeong were hilarious as Dr. Nefario & Floyd respectively.

Confused waste of potential,"I enjoyed the first Despicable Me quite a bit. Especially the minions were great fun. This is one reason I was really disappointed after finishing DM 2.The film had almost no plot to speak of. There was no tension or excitement at any point. If there was an issue, it was resolved within minutes or even seconds. None of the characters went through any sort of gradual personality change. The ones that did change did so from one scene to the next, often with no explanation or a only single line to let you know why.The first minutes offered several laughs and chuckles. After that, I may have smiled slightly four times. I did consider leaving the cinema twice, and I noticed about 15 people who did so. Most jokes fell flat and were overplayed, overused, embarrassing and annoying. Lucy was clearly supposed to be found annoying by Gru, but she was also unbearably cringe-worthy to the audience at all times. The minions constituted more than half of all the ""funny moments"" in the story and surprisingly failed completely. It was if they had brain stormed ""funny minion costumes"" and ""100 stupid situations minions can get themselves into"" and then just selected them at random to plop into the film now and then. I don't know how they are going to do a Minion film now that we have already been bombarded with unfunny repetitive sketches throughout all of DM 2. All I know is I will not watch it.The animation was quite good. It was smooth and at times fairly pretty. Some characters and animals were designed in a pleasingly humorous way while others were exaggerated to the point of being silly and aggravating.Overall the story was a mess with no direction, no excitement and mostly shallow, irritating characters. It was a weak foundation for many tired attempts at squeezing out the last cuteness and comicality of the minions.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Laughed entire movie with kids,"We loved DM1, and loved DM2 as much if not more (more Minions means more laughs!!). My 8 and 10 year old's were all smiles pretty much the entire movie with the entire sold out crowd all in sync in the non stop laughter. I read a couple so-called ""movie reviewer's"" slamming it.I don't know what movie they were watching but even Mom and I loved it too, awesome movie. The Minions steal the movie (sure this is of no surprise to anyone!). Carrell and Bridesmaid star Kirsten were great voices and were a great animation love story that unfolds in front of your eyes.Now the kids are going to drive us crazy to take them to see it again.

A Good Story And It Left Me With Tears In My Eyes From Laughing,"I am truly delighted to see that this movie gets a good rating. So many good animated films get low ratings I suspect because adults just don't get them. Obviously people are getting ""Despicable Me 2."" I just left the theatre not too long ago, and it's one of the few times that I've had a movie leave with with tears in my eyes from laughing. It's a very funny movie - one that gets funnier as it moves along; one whose funniest moments in my opinion (and from the laughter in the theatre) came at the very end. It's a tremendously worthy sequel to the original, which was also very good. In fact, I think I enjoyed this more than I did the original.The villain Gru is back once again, but this time he's more of an anti- villain. He's busy playing daddy to the three little girls he adopted in the first movie, and he's turned his crime lab into a jam and jelly making factory. But an unknown villain appears on the scene threatening the world, and Gru is recruited by the ""Anti-Villain League"" to use his villainous expertise to find out who it is. He's partnered with Lucy, who - predictably enough - becomes a love interest for him. But somehow the ""romance"" doesn't distract from the story the way they so often do. It added to the story. It gave us a better sense of Gru - who he was and where he came from. It worked surprisingly well.And, of course, there are the minions. All sorts of minions. Everywhere and all over and in almost every scene it seemed. And they're just as funny as they were in the first movie as well.The best part of this is that it's not just a cartoon, and it's not just for kids, and it's not a weak sequel. It has a story to it; a plot that actually works and keeps the viewer surprisingly interested all the way through. Everybody involved with this deserves credit for putting out a winner. My one piece of advice is not to simply get up and leave when the credits start to roll! (9/10)",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Fantastic Visual Treat,"I got to watch the advance screening, and I have to say, it was one of the best I have seen. The movie nicely blended together fantastic imagery, distinctive music, hilarious comedy and an original plot line.The animation is crisp and clean. The 3D isn't overused and all ""in- your-face"". There are many stunning settings and locations; each one has obviously designed with great care to depict a particular mood or atmosphere. Combined with the various angles used (first and second person, bird's eye views), this movie is a delightful visual treat.Story-wise, Despicable Me 2 wasn't a great as the visuals, but formidable just the same. Yes, there was character development and an easy-to- follow plot-line, but it seemed just a little bit weak. The movie didn't tie up some loose ends, but they were trivial and seriously don't detract from the overall story.The music of Despicable Me 2 is very distinctive, both compared to other movies and between different scenes and environments. There is edgy, electronic music, upbeat spy music, rhythmic salsa music, and of course, the ""Despicable Me"" theme song.Despicable Me 2 does a fantastic job appealing to both the kids and the adults. A rule of thumb is that anything the minions do, the kids will laugh at it. the adults get an impressive mix of pop songs in the 80s- 90s, however they are usually sung in the minion's gibberish.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Weak rehash of ideas from the first one,"The animation is good, and actors have done a good job providing the voices. However, the movie remains a confused and weak rehash of the same ideas of the first one. Shark? Check. Missile? Check. Crazy contraptions? Check.This second installment begins many plot themes, but none of them materialize into a story. Not enough time is devoted to get any story line going, and the movie jumps from one to the other. Sometimes when the movie gets back (for example, to the hair club), that's when you remember 'Oh, yeah! that happened"".In the end, there is not much time for a climax, and it ends up being silly, but not in an entertaining way.Where the movie really fails is in the expectations set by the first one. The richness of the various characters are missing, even that of Mr. Perkins. Ultimately, the girls don't have much to do, nor Dr. Nefario, Gru's mother, or even the minions.Sequels often fall short of the first, but with the imagination shown in the first one, you would think that they would have enough left over for making another one. Unfortunately, it looks there was just enough imagination left for the Trailer.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

The entire audience was laughing out loud the entire movie. I.m so glad they waited to make sure the next movie was equal quality or better. And it's better.

First Film Was Just A Little Better.....,"Despicable Me 2, the sequel to the 2010 smash hit, is an entertaining film and quite funny at times. It's not as good as the first film as it lacks the creative dialog the first film possessed. That being said, the Minions were funny and adorable as usual, the animation was crisp, the characters were worth getting to know, but it lacks the fresh feel of the original. Kids will adore this film and even most adults would like it somewhat. If you're a fan of the first film, you may come to enjoy the sequel.This film marks the return of Gru. But this time, Gru is not a villain as he is trying to work on his parenting skills. But he gets recruited by the Anti-Villain League to go undercover and find out which person stole a secret Antarctic lab. Along the way, he gets help from Lucy, the awkward agent from the League.This film has a respectable voice cast. Steve Carell returns as Gru and does an effective job. Russell Brand and Miranda Cosgrove also return and they did a good job. Kristen Wiig is a good addition to the cast and I think she's perfect for Lucy, instead of Ms. Hattie. I wanted to see Al Pacino voice the villain, but I think Benjamin Bratt did a fair enough job.Overall, Despicable Me 2 does not feel as fresh as the first film, but it still makes for a high-quality piece of entertainment. The visuals are excellent and this movie makes good use for the music. The story seems a little stale, but then isn't that the case for many sequels? But I had a fun time and I'm sure many children did too. I rate this film 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The Minions are probably one of the funniest characters ever created.,"My review of 'Despicable Me2':Got to watch 'Despicable Me' - the first part just a few days back.Yes I know I was very late and was surely left wondering at the end of it 'Just what the hell took me so long to watch this piece of animation all this while?'.It was downright enjoyable so with the hilarious trailers of the sequel hitting the scene I was like all eager to watch it in 3D at the theatre. There are only a very few movies which I go and watch on the big screen unless its running at my favorite theatre in town coz of the EXPerience factor. 'Despicable Me' was really good and the the trailers of this sequel were so convincing that it had to be one of those exceptional cases.The first part was definitely original and introduced us to the amazingly cute and hilarious world of minions - the tiny yellow beings :) 'Despicable Me 2' borrows the theme and builds on from its predecessor and takes it to a whole new level. The story is kept quite simple while focusing on the character development of its protagonist the 'Gru'. There are different shades to Gru's character which we get to witness in this one. He is quite a different man now in this one from the one we used to know in the first half of 'Despicable Me'. His affectionate, protective, romantic ( or not so romantic at times ) and caring nature is revealed. The three girls whom he had adopted also are quite smart now and one can't simply resist oneself but fall for the irresistible cuteness of the youngest of them Agnes. I mean there quite a few scenes between Gru and her which would melt your heart and make you go 'Aawwwwww....'. The introduction of the character of Lucy as the eccentric and sweet spy agent is very well done. No I won't give away spoilers here but you will know what I am talking about once you watch it :) But for me the show stealers got to be the incredibly unique minions. Hats off to the person(or team) in whose mind the idea of creating such characters was born.I mean there are hundreds of them and if you ask me they account for the funniest parts of the movie. They are adorable , confused, cute and convincingly funny little beings.Lets talk about the voice overs now. After watching the first part I felt that Steve Carell as the voice of Gru couldn't have done it any better but honestly he beat me to it. I mean being a non Latino himself how does he manage to pull off that kind of Hispanic accent with so much ease? Hats off to this man really who also happens to be one of the funniest American celebrities. OK now Gru is at least human but how to manage to voice over for one of the funniest characters ever 'the Minions' ? Leave that job to Pierre Coffin and what you get is an unique and downright hilarious dialect even though you don't understand most of it lol. I mean I still can't get over that 'Silas Ramsbottom. bottom ..hehehaha..' part really. There's a song sung by the Minions at the end. Let me know what you think of it.Technically the film is gorgeous. With the skill level of the artists and animators and with the kind of high end equipment at their disposal almost every 3D animation movie looks eye candy in recent times. So I would not say I saw something groundbreaking which I haven't seen lately. But this in no way undermines the quality of animation which 'Despicable Me 2' has to offer. Specially loved the fur and the water effects.The 3D is nice and it has its moments for sure in some of the scenes. In terms of overall feel of depth throughout the length of the movie however I felt that 'Epic' had the edge.The 3D was smoother and more consistent in 'Epic' but it isn't bad at all in 'Despicable Me2'. If you want to see more of it wait till the main end credits start rolling and you will get to witness some 'in your face' kind of 3D minion action :)Apart from its technical brilliance what really made this movie shine and such a joy ride for me was the characterisation, the human touch and the insanely hilarious quotient. I normally am not used to laughing out loud at the theatre but this one really had me and during some scenes I was not able to control it at just the giggling level. This movie will be loved by kids and adults alike. If you have watched and loved 'Despicable Me' then I am sure you would want to go out and enjoy this FUN ride as well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The Minions Stole the Screen!,"What can I say about animation movies? In average, animation movies are easy-watching and awesome. Both the graphics, humor, and the story is usually so simple. Mostly about good versus evil. In this Despicable Me 2, the good versus bad is the main theme but all the aspect in this movie is good.First, the cute minions, which I think are the number 1 attraction in this movie, really stole the screen. With their cute shape (?), hilarious voice and behavior, the Minions are really awesome and, yeah, cute.Gru, the main character is also hilarious and don't forget his awesome accent and way of talking. I don't really care about the girls (Margo, Edith, and Agnes). But they are good additions for the movie and the love of Gru's life. And Lucy is another person of interest in this sequel. She's hilarious.Good animation and awesome humor, especially the Minions, this movie is really recommended for everyone.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Gru the Good,"I thought Despicable Me 2 was just as adorable as the first. Gru has given up his villainary to raise his precious new daughters.

Make way for Lucy (Kristen Wiig).Lucy, an Anti-Villain League agent, recruited the hapless Gru to help catch a villain. Lucy was so lively, animated, strange and likable. Her character added a lot to the movie. I would say that she was to Despicable Me 2 what Vector was to part one except in a different capacity. Of course the minions delivered as you knew they would. They're so good they have their own movie now. I thought the movie was very complimentary of the first installment and a nice follow up.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A defense of Al Pacino,"Looks like that this animated full-length film by Illumination Entertainment became successful thanks to Al Pacino's ""creative differences"". On the other hand, the voice of Eduardo/El Macho sounds like an animated character from a Latin American cartoon and definitely not the real Al Pacino voice I expected for a while. Actually, I supported him, but someone else became the voice of Eduardo/El Macho. Was Al Pacino as the voice of Eduardo/El Macho a deception from Illumination Entertainment? Or it was just a lie? I have no idea, but any attempt to make an animated or a video game character with Al Pacino's voice failed. Anyway, I support Al Pacino's ambitions as a voice actor.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Underwhelming, but cute","I really liked the first film, so I was definitely looking forward to the sequel. I thought it to be one of the best animated movies the summer box office would offer.I can't say this movie is bad whatsoever. I can say it was overwhelming and the plot practically nonexistent.Despicable Me 2 is the epitome of cute, but hardly thought-provoking like the first film or features like PIXAR's (most of them).Gru and Lisa had an adorable meet-cute and Agnes, Edith, and Margot are equally adorable. However, the villain and the ending of the film before the last scene was anti-climactic and leaves questions.Overall, not a misfire and a moneymaker. Will I watch again? Probably not. Honestly, I kept thinking I was getting too old to enjoy films like this, but I do love many animated films. This was not one of them.",2.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Enjoyed it more than the first one.,"Despicable Me 2 offers a fun sequel with vibrant CGI and brighter, denser colors compared to the first film. The introduction of new characters and the continued antics of the minions keeps the energy high and the humor fresh. Compared to the first film, there are more scenes featuring the minions, whose interactions remain hilarious.The film maintains its wholesome vibe, particularly through themes of parenting and dating. Lucy, voiced by Kristen Wiig, who also voiced Lola Bunny in Looney Tunes, brings a similar charm to her character. The wordplay and puns from the first movie are back but not so much. Agnes delivers some particularly great and memorable lines. The chemistry between Gru and Lucy is fantastic, making them a compelling duo. Gru's character development, especially in the dating scenes, is relatable and empathetic. The dialogue is well-timed and enhances the narrative rather than feeling random.However, the villain in this installment feels underdeveloped, and the final fight scene is somewhat disappointing. Despite this, the film is highly enjoyable. The music is a highlight, featuring Pharrell Williams, whose songs add a nostalgic and fitting touch.Overall, Despicable Me 2 is a vibrant and enjoyable sequel with excellent character development and humor. Hence, I give it a solid 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Pretty Despicable Again,"Despicable Me 2 is the second film in the franchise about the Minions and Gru. It continues Gru's story by introducing a love interest in Lucy. It also introduces the AVL (Anti Villain League). The plot seems pretty simple with it being targeted towards children. I find it is as good as the first. I often have the unpopular opinion that the sequel(s) is as good or even better than the original and this one is no exception. Oftentimes, I might not feel the same if it was the fourth entry of a particular title and this is only the second. I like the evil minions and we could've seen more of them. Maybe do something more with the PX-41 serum in a future installment in the Despicable Me franchise. That seems a little underutilized in this film. That is probably why I find this film interesting and as good as the first.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Great Sequel,"If you saw the first Despicable Me, you probably didn't think that it would ever need a sequel. But this movie fits in with the series perfectly. It gives you all of what you probably loved about the first film and gave you a new great story to enjoy. This movie is pretty good for any age to watch. I'll admit that some parts of this movie follows predictable story lines that you see in mostly any movie. But, there's enough in here that'll surprise you if you've never seen it before. I highly recommend it to anyone. As a PG movie you might have to put up with some crudity that you otherwise wouldn't, but that tends to happen in a lot of good movies. So if you are looking for a good use of time, then you might want to see this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
One word- MINIONASTIC!!,"I had loved the first movie for the theme and of course, for the heart- warming story of a Bad-guy-turning-good. Now, in the second movie,one look at the teasers and we got to know that this had plenty of mad minions running amok and a purple monster let out loose. With plenty of minion movies out in Youtube, I have become a self- proclaimed Minion fan and this was the Major reason for me to watch this movie! Was I let down? Well, No!! I got my share of U2 styled minions, Hawaii styled minions, nanny styled minions and many more of Kevin, Dave and they gave the movie a push that has made Despicable 2 better than the first one for sure! A villain turned doting father is what Gru has become and the story goes ahead with a lot of love, relationships and family themes running in the background of heinous plots, villains and monsters. I would rate this movie a cool 9 out of 10!! any day!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Great Movie for all ages,"This movie was extremely funny which was to be expected because of the first movie. This movie has funny moments, romantic moments, and just plain cute moments. The actors and actresses in this movie are perfect for the characters. I do not know who came up with the minions in the first movie, but whoever it was, I give them kudos! The minions make this movie so much more worth seeing. They definitely add to the comedic side of the movie. The story line of this movie was pretty standard, but the writer put a fun twist on it. The character designs match the characters personalities perfectly, which they probably do on purpose, but I still thought I would say, ""Job well done."" I took my two year old niece to this movie, and as we were sitting in the theater, I noticed that she was speechless throughout the whole movie. She was entranced. She cracked-up whenever the minions where on. Let me just say that for a two year old to sit that well through a movie must mean it is pretty good. All in all, I would definitely put this movie on your ""must watch"" list; you will not be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Still got the charm.,"The original was adorable and very funny, and even though its sequel lives on that it's still well done and captures what made the original so loveable.Gru is now looking out for the three girls, Agnes, Edith and Margo while being recruited by the Anti Villain League to capture the mastermind behind a mysterious abduction of an entire laboratory from the arctic circle.He ends up working with the enthusiastic Lucy Wilde and then the fun begins. They go through so many hilarious scenes together, and give the minions a run for their money.Saying much more would be spoiling the movie's central plot points, but let's put it this way: Despicable Me 2 delivers what is expected but does not feel like a rehash at all with the heart and the humour still being top-notch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
You have to watch it if you love minions!,"Lots of light scenes from the stupidity of Gru's minions. Lots of cuteness from the girls (Margo, Edith and Agnes).But the story is very predictable. The drama is not too strong, there are some tense from the action scenes, but not much, not enough to brought people's tense expression.This movie will instantly bored you when you don't see minions or the girls on the scene.I am saying that this film is very funny, cute, hilarious, but not good enough as a drama. If you haven't watch this movie, you can't hope too much from it's story, but you'll laugh pretty hard as you see the minions, and you'll be amazed from the cuteness of the girls.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Better than the 2010 movie,"""Despicable Me"" was a 2010 toon hit that capitalized on the idea that a villain's heart could be filled by three orphan girls. Universal/Illumination's sequel, ""Despicable Me 2,"" finds the still-surly Gru just lonely enough to accommodate a love interest, Steve Carell's overcompensating character. The sequel extends co-directors Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin's delightfully silly sensibility to a larger universe, with Gru repurposing his arsenal of fearsome inventions to keep his adopted daughters entertained. His highly adaptable crew of gibberish-spouting Minions do double duty, alternating between glorified babysitters and elbow grease on Gru's latest enterprise: developing a line of delicious jellies and jams. Secret agent Lucy Wilde, voiced by Kristen Wiig, represents an organization called the Anti-Villain League that seeks to recruit Gru. Lucy is not just Gru's equal in nearly every way but also his romantic match. The script not-so-subtly suggests that Lucy is vacant as early as Gru's first scene. The unnecessarily complicated scenario serves to bring this odd couple together, despite the script not being as charming or unique as the original. ""Despicable Me 2"" is a sequel to the popular animated series, which focuses on the Minions, a group of yellow characters who have a unique feature in the works. The film is based on the classic hand-drawn cartoon tradition, with the Minions embracing the loony design, zany humor, and impossible physics pioneered by Hanna-Barbera, Friz Freleng, and Chuck Jones. The film's focus on amusement is evident in the characters, including the Minions, who perform themselves, and new additions like Ken Jeong, Steve Coogan, and Benjamin Bratt. El Macho, a former villain, is the lead suspect in Gru's undercover investigation into the theft of the serum. Gru's eldest daughter Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) falls for El Macho's hipster son, Antonio (Moises Arias), compromising Gru's objectivity in the case. The film divides its allegiance evenly between grown-up and kid characters, rather than pandering to youngsters. The 3D format and Pharrell Williams' funky theme keep things moving, but certain story threads remain unresolved amid the toon's rush to entertain. The film ditches the mall location and abandons Gru and Lucy's cupcake-making cover stories, assuming that Minion cover versions of ""I Swear"" and ""YMCA"" will excuse the lack of a proper ending. The creative team takes advantage of the 3D format and Pharrell Williams' funky theme, but some story threads remain unresolved.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The Best Sequel Of The Year So Far.,"Only in the past year was I introduced to 'Despicable Me' and the world of the minions. Since then I have been anticipating the sequel with much eagerness. Whilst Pixar may dominate the awards and the box office with their films, it's great to see Sony Animations putting their first sequel on the big screen. Is 'Despicable Me 2' a worthy sequel or just a lazy money grabbing summer flick? Well, the smile I had on my face throughout the film should say it all.The film opens by reuniting us with Gru, his daughters and the minions at a birthday party. We watch the minions slapstick humour fill the screen with laughs and also see how Gru is adapting to a life without being a super villain. Each of the characters are moving on in some way or another, Gru is still single and his girls want him to find love, whilst Margot is having boy troubles if his own. Gru is recruited anti- villain league to stop a new super criminal whilst also learning a little more about family life and love.'Despicable Me 2' is a funny and friendly family film. Whilst the minions take up the majority of the films laughs, each of the characters has their moments in the spot light. Steve Carell gives a great voice performance as Gru, as does the rest of the cast. Kristen Wiig is a much welcomed member to the cast as Lucy, Gru's new undercover partner and I look forward to seeing her character in the future.As with many of Pixar's films, Sony Animations have created a genre that works on levels both for adults and children. I may have been one of the only people in the screening without a small child, but I still laughed and enjoyed the film as much as any of the children in the cinema. Also with rumours that the minions will be getting their own movie spin off circulating, it shows that the 'Despicable Me' world has much more fun to spread.A solid sequel that's full of laughs and more importantly heart. 'Despicable Me 2' is a great family film for the whole family this summer. 'Monsters University' really has its work cut out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Despicable Me 2 - Short Noodles Review,"I just have to stress how much replay value this movie has. I can honestly watch it so many times. There's never really a dull moment in this movie. If you liked the first one, I'm pretty sure you'll like this one too. Personally, I loved the first one and I might even like this one more. Despicable Me 2 is about the ex-villain Gru moving on from his life of crime and instead raising his family (of which the youngest girl Agnes is probably the cutest animated character. Ever.). Along the way, there's a spy conspiracy concerning a supervillain on his hands, as well as the outstandingly lovable minions. We all love the minions and the makers of this film realized and capitalized on that. There's so much more minion humour in this movie and it's great. Essentially all the humour in this movie is laugh-out-loud hilarious and the best funny parts are the really subtle things. It's actually rewarding in a sense. The second half of the movie is also filled with cool spy stuff (bear in mind that it's not Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol though) and it's all fun and entertaining, while still retaining all the laughs. It's fun for kids, teenagers, and adults: the quintessential family movie of this year so far and definitely the funniest.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A sequel that is better than the original. - Designed to perfection. Very visually appealing,"A sequel that is better than the original.I know, I know, that's very hard to come by, but this film achieves that rarefied air.I love the idea of Gru being a good guy now. He is basically a full time dad first, and an agent second. He is basically an animated Ethan Hunt now. He even mentions Mission Impossible, which was amusing to hear.Visually these films are getting better and better, with this one being no exception. I don't understand how they are getting better with such a relatively short period of time in between the movies. I loved how the mall looked. Being covered with all that glass in the shape of a dome, was a great design element.The Minions ""ice cream bar"" scene was hilarious. I really like how they do the same things as humans, but in their own cute minionistic way.Gru being an overprotective father while Margo has her thing, was so endearing. He really loves these girls at this point. He is dedicated to them and it shows.That date scene Gru had, was very cringy to watch. I know who the target audience is and they might not catch it. But wtf, taking her home like that after they knocked her out. No biggie, just made me raise my eyebrows a bit.The villain in this movie was very meh. He didn't capture my attention much. His house and restaurant all looked gorgeous, but he lacked charisma in my opinion. Not saying he was horrible, just very lackluster.When talking about this franchise, the plot doesn't matter. They are all the same, with some subtle changes here and there. It's all about the minions and Gru, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. You make films to entertain, this franchise does it very well.I absolutely loved the idea of what happened at the end, it makes Gru and his family complete.An amazing film, which looked absolutely fabulous. A very worth addition to the franchise.This gets a LennyReviewz Score of: 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Awesome Movie,"Despicable Me 2 is a great film. We like to watch it a lot. The characters in the film are lovely and kind. For example Gru, he is an evil man but he is also a good dad. He always love and take care of his daughters. We also love the minions. Because they are so cute and adorable. They sing so funny and great. We love all of their songs at Gru's wedding. They sing I Swear but they read Underwear. It made us laugh over and over. We love the 3 daughters of Gru. They always care about their dad. That makes us love them a lot. In conclusion, we think the film is fantastic and want to watch it over and over again. We definitely recommend this movie to everybody. Everyone must watch this movie at least 5 times.ILA S3A Class: Milly Daisy Van Kate Erika",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Almost as good as the first one, recommended","I'm sad to say but this was the last great entry into the franchise. It just fell off from here. ""Despicable Me"" 1 & 2 were amazing, and at first I didn't think the sequel would even compare to the first entry but I actually also enjoyed myself with this sequel, although not as good as the first, it probably will hold a special place in my mind for some time to come.It had all the charms from the first movie, the minions were funny, Gru was an evil funny genius, the plot was fun, and the introduction of a new female character who manages to be hilarious as well.

A hilarious animation,"Gru, an ex-villain but now a proud father gets a job offer he apparently cannot refuse: to work for a secret society in order to track down an undercover bad guy. This assignment will prove to be quite a challenge for him as his new partner Lucy isn't the ordinary kind of girl anyone might expect.I have to say (and I honestly didn't expect this) that this sequel is actually better than the original. The way it introduces its story and the way the minions are used for comedy is really impressing. Gru's change of attitude is even more dramatic while sudden turn-overs keep the suspense up and running. Although it manages to be a little dramatic which combined with some romance give it a special feel, it isn't as profound as other titles in its category.But never mind that, its true Pièce de résistance is actually its comedy. The way all aspects are put together supplied with a whole bunch of minions create the most pure comedy I've seen in an animation. It was so funny I didn't realize I was still laughing after the scene in question was already over. For this part alone it deserves to be seen, not to mention its other great features.

They were a pure joy to watch.I wasn't so keen on El Macho as the bad guy though. Vector from the first film was perfect, because I really didn't want him to succeed, but El Macho didn't quite have the same presence.I firmly believe that at least the first two 'Despicable Me' instalments will live on for many years as must watch films for most generations.

This time it is Despicable !,"Summary: Fun movie for kids. For movie goers, just boring !It is one of the most anticipated movie of the year. First part was a huge success with Gru, Minions & Girls. So this movie was a must watch for me.It is obvious that you expect a lot from the movie. Let me tell you, if you haven't seen first part go and watch the movie though you won't get the references about who is who. But it's OK. You will like it.For those who have watched first part, guys don't watch in theaters. Yes, I am saying truth. It is not the worst movie. It will be good entertaining 90 mins. but the excitement with which you will try to see, you will get bored. For children it is OK, they don't care about story, direction. For them it's absolute fun.Here are my thought about the movie.Why Watch: Fun of minions - First part revolved mostly around Gru with some short but best minions fun. This time story is WITH the Gru but with breaks of funny minions (which is not always) it's like watching a boring movie with really good commercials.Same here, Gru's story with some snippets of minions shorts. Agnes - Agnes here got some focus due to her funny cuteness. Other part - This is the actual story. which is funny at times but boring as well. It doesn't take you to the peak of fun but there are ups and downs.Why not: Boring story. This movie doesn't have the soul. Direction: Story doesn't focus on the story. Instead takes some minions shorts & other funny shorts. It's just not continuous.Overall score: 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
I loved it,I loved this movie so much. I always think that the second movie will be so bad but I would definitely give this movie a chance. It was so funny and entertaining I never wanted the 98 minutes (1 hour 18 min.) to end. Most of the characters came back and the minions are still my personal favorites. I have always loved the casting of the characters in this movie. I think they all take control of the role they were given and it sounds like they are having so much fun in the booth that they had recorded it in. The reason I gave this movie a 9 not ten is because even though I was super entertained there was one part of me that said this movie isn't as perfect as the first (but quite close). I always see movies when they come out and this one I was so happy to spend my 2 hours seeing. I would so recommend seeing this movie!,9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
It Bring a lot of joy.,"The feeling after watching is that the minions have significantly increased their role, and there are many new images. The creator may have spent too much thought on the minions, and I feel that other characters have been left out. , The little yellow man is the biggest cute point. The protagonist's love story is a bit old-fashioned, but it's not a romance in itself.

The Minions Are Back - Ever So Moreso,"I think this film is a very cute sequel to ""Despicable Me"" and good news, the minions are in it even more. The 3D animation is wonderful in this movie and the designs and colors are very fun visually. I can tell the creators of this film paid attention to what audiences enjoyed most out of the first movie and that is what influenced a lot of ""Despicable Me 2."" I think all of the voice actors suited their characters perfectly. This film brings back the familiar voices of Miranda Cosgrove, Steve Carell and Russell Brand, while also adding in newer characters such as Lucy voiced by Kristen Wiig, Antonio voiced by Moises Arias and many others.My favorite character is actually all of the minions. I loved them all so much in the first ""Despicable Me"" and I think it was a great decision to include them for in the sequel. Their banter is so funny, even though I can't understand their gibberish, their motions tell the story of what they're trying to communicate. I think the way they work together and fight is very comical and all of their interactions are very funny. The minions really are the perfect side kicks to Gru since he is so wacky.My favorite scene would probably be when Gru finds out that Margo is on a date. He freaks out so much and goes running around the mall trying to stop the two of them from being alone. It's really funny and although it is a bit over exaggerated, it still shows what all fathers go through when their daughters start showing an interest in dating. I also think it's funny how Margo's sisters react to her new romantic interests. Edith, being a total tomboy, thinks that it is disgusting for her sister to go on a date with a boy. Agnes on the other hand thinks it's the cutest thing and immediately starts saying that they are in love, which only worries Gru even more. The entire scene is filled with very funny, memorable dialog and interactions between the main characters and is definitely a scene that stands out for me.I recommend this film for ages 6+ and anyone who enjoyed ""Despicable Me"" will absolutely love ""Despicable Me 2."" I give this film 4 out of 5 stars. It has the perfect mix of humor for children and adults so it makes for an enjoyable experience for all.Reviewed by KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Raven D.

Despicable in the Wrong Ways,"5.4 of 10 vs. 8.25 for the first. Sadly, like the spy hero gadget-tech films it's intended to satirize, this is little more than a spy gadget film. Unlike the first, this gets tiresome and even boring. They really seem to be forcing ideas and plot developments. It's still relatively entertaining, but nowhere near the story depth and inventiveness of the first.Original and sequel both borrow a lot from other cartoons in terms of the look and characters, so the story is the key to making it into something more than a bunch of cartoon images and quirky sounds/images. Quirkiness alone can work for up to a half hour, but definitely not beyond 60 minutes.Stick with the first or the more recent Wreck It Ralph (2012) if you're feeling like a villain.

An excellent follow up to the original,"I remember watching this movie in the theater over a decade ago and I loved it. Even though the original didn't need a sequel, this was an excellent way to continue the story.Positives for Despicable Me 2 (2013):
It's a lot of fun to be on another adventure with these characters. There are still those moments where you'll be laughing and smiling throughout the movie. Gru is still an awesome protagonist as Steve Carrell is always phenomenal with his performances. I also really liked Kristen Wiig as Lucy and the way both her and Steve Carrell play off each other was entertaining. Benjamin Bratt was great as El Macho in this movie and while he's not as great as Vector, he's also a lot of fun. The Minions continue to be one of the highlights of this franchise. And finally, the action sequences in this movie are a lot of fun.Negatives for Despicable Me 2 (2013):
There's a subplot involving Dr. Nefario that was very predictable from the moment it happened. Also, the three girls are pushed off to the sideline and for me there were points in the movie where their presence were definitely needed. There's a pointless romance between Margo and El Macho's son that could've been taken out of the movie and you would've had the same movie without it.

not all that great,"after loving the original one, we all expected something more extravagant than the first one! but it ended up being a huge disappointment. I almost feel like they should do over and pretend like the second movie never happened. I feel like the story line was all about the minions and they completely forgot to implement the girls or even more of Gru in there. moreover it dragged on and on and on. It almost felt like the audience for the first movie were mainly adults and the producers felt like they messed up and decided to make the second one address kids in particular. they could keep the adult audience and address the kids as well, after the huge success they had with the first movie.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Genuinely lovable; a worthy sequel, consistent jokes and that same sense of humor from the first movie","Despite the great voice talent involved, DESPICABLE ME 2 is really about the minions. The lion's share of the film's laughs come from them, and they are its comedic muscle. It's not hard to see that the little yellow Twinkies are the franchise's marketing bread and butter, but they're so shot up with personality and Three Stooges violence, that that's not at all a bad thing.And the laughs haven't diminished with each subsequent viewing. The movie has me in stitches at every turn, and it does feature one of the greatest scenes in the history of cinema (""Bee-do bee-do bee-do). Not to mention the singularly most infectious pop song in 30 years (""Happy""), and the 21 Fart Gun Salute, which I can only hope to arrange for my funeral.Regardless of where they go for the next movie (straight-up sequel or a full-on Minions movie), I say bring it on.

Not A Great Instalment,I did not enjoy this instalment at all. The crew could have created the storyline heaps better. It did not make any sense at all to me. The cast selection was excellent.

Lovable Mi(nions)..!,"Now i am just fresh out of a screening of the most adorable 'Despicable Me 2' here in Chennai and i feel like i have to write down a review to 'pusher' people to definitely watch this one ASAP.Although i would have to be honest and concede that it's more ""lovable Gru"" than ""despicable Gru"",i would be a fool if i said Steve Carell doesn't uplift his role with new-found enchantment;while keeping in touch with his usual loathing self,despite the fact that he loses his villainous demeanor and dons a much,shall i say,welcome hero.Come on we could all see it coming.!How else could the second installment have turned about...The lady character in Lucy mostly fills up the empty spaces with good wits yet the character itself tends to fizzle out after a promising intro..It's all understandable still because the tech crew has packed so much content into a 90 min flick that some children might fall out of it,you know..Having said all that,Despicable me 2 belongs right up there with the elites of animation movies like ""The Croods"",""Megamind"" and the like...Just enough for everyone..Pure family entertainment... And NOW moving on to the best part of the movie - NO its not the 3 cutest girls in the world (the tiniest one is my favorite by far though ;but the premise of the whole sisterhood thing i thought was brilliant right from the word go),it is THE MINIONS...!Oh yes folks who enjoyed the first part know what i am talking about..It's almost like the screenwriters guessed the audience craved for more..This is the high point of the movie..Whenever the minions make an appearance,no matter how small they bring the biggest cheers to the audience hearts..So innovatively created;these so-called minions,the real superstars of this tremendously colorful animation world are the ones that keep the loaded film intact(whether they come in purple or yellow)..And special mention about the end which is just as awesome as the beginning,maybe even better..

Despicable Me 2 review,"The first Despicable Me film has come out as a personal favorite among CGI-animations; it is a zany world of mad supervillains, awesome gadgets and superweapons, funny characters, and some of the most quotable and most hilarious dialogue I've seen in a while.This second film offers more of the same, for better or for worse. It does still dish out huge helpings of imaginative gadgets, transforming vehicles, crazy weapons, and mad villains. There's still a huge amount of slappy, silly comedy, amusing dialogue, and fun characters. The minions are back in full force, often stealing the show with their zany antics and unique lingo.The only problem is, something feels out of place. Part of it is the comedy; there's certainly a lot of physical gags at work, but it doesn't feel as fresh or memorable as the first film. The dialogue is also lacking in particularly memorable or quotable lines. The gags feel like they're aiming more and more at the kids, and while they'll certainly get a kick out of everything, it'll leave the adults wishing there was something more.I think the plot is also to blame. It is notable for progressing the characters along in their relationships. In doing so, it puts out a number of individual subplots that don't really tie into the main story. The subplots in the first film at least tied in with the main conflict, but here, it's purely distracting and random. That being said, I did enjoy the characters and their nuances.This film utilizes the same animation style and quality as the first film. It shows a little more ambition as it fills up the screen with endless minions and detailed settings. Movements are cartoony and exaggerated, as before. Character designs are pretty much the same as before; they're wild, but distinctive. Even though some viewers found Kristen Wiig's character a little too animated and wacky, I enjoyed watching her. Voice-acting from the whole cast is great. The writing is okay. Designs for all the settings, props, costumes, and creatures are decent. Music is pretty lively and fun.I personally favor the first film over this sequel, but it is fun to see the characters and minions back in action, and to see new faces and new gizmos on display. Unfortunately, the film seems to aim more at the lowest-common denominator, and the plot suffers a little; it's great for kids, okay for adults, and would be worth a rental for anybody who wants more of Gru and the imaginative world he inhabits.4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Average | Film: Good)",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Just as entertaining as the first,"I'm not sure if anyone saw the first Despicable Me (2010) being the success that many people remember it as today. It certainly had a lot going for it considering its clever plot, funny characters and unique slapstick. And once the box office reports were in, it was obvious that a sequel would be on its way at some point - although I'm not certain if people thought it would arrive three years later. But it's important to understand that for the past three years, the producers must have put in a lot of work to make sure this next chapter in Gru's life was just as entertaining as the first and it did just that.This time, fans find Gru as a new man, making jam and jelly products with his goofy minions and three adopted children. Little does he realize that another evil villain is planning to take over the world. So in order to stop this from happening, Gru is given an offer from the Anti-Villain League (AVL) to stop this new threat. And as the plot continues, he begins to learn even more things about himself he didn't think he would overcome. Along with that are some new characters like El Macho (voiced by Benjamin Bratt) and Lucy (Kristen Wiig), and agent of AVL who partners up with Gru. Oh and let's not forget the new purple minion - what personality, ha!What's great about this sequel is that it feels like nothing was changed at all; which is great. The continuity is clung onto tightly like the first film, the characters all still have their respective voices, the tone is still the same as well as the musical score. Even though it's been three years, it honestly feels like the first one ended literally a year before. That's how close these two match each other and that proves that the time was worth the wait. There isn't much else to say other than if you enjoyed the first one, watching this will be just as enjoyable.The sequel to the 2010 hit replicates the formula so well that it may feel more like an extension of the day after the events of the first movie. Either way, it still is just as fun.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Fairly entertaining,"Having seen a trailer for Despicable Me 2 I was quite looking forward to watching the movie. Most animated films are aimed at adults as well as children and DM2 is no exception although the focus is probably more towards the children. I saw the 3d version of the film and there are some scenes which were undoubtedly better in 3d. The end credits are a particular example.The storyline revolves around Gru a retired crook being hired by the anti villain league and being paired with the rather pretty Lucy. They investigate a crime and the movie is always watchable, but never quite memorable. Overall pretty entertaining and sure kids will love it.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
very funny film great family entertainment,"Despicable Me 2 is one of those rare cases that a hit animated film's sequel surpasses the original film, The main character Gru (voiced by Steve Carell)is likable and funny. The minions however are the main stars, they had me laughing on multiple occasions during the film. The language created for the minions is very well done as they speak in a fictional language but you can always gather what they are saying.I found the visuals very impressive, it was very colourful and very imaginative. The action scenes we also very well done.I will say tho you have to love the minions there like the squirrel in ice age it just wouldn't be the same with out them, special with the thing they do, they really do have you rolling around on the floor laughing your head off.In this film their just more funnier than they were in the first film which was good as well, but this is a great family afternoon film that will leave you happy after watching as it a feel good film.

"Unpopular opinion, I know","I watched Despicable Me only to understand what was the deal with the Minion memes. Although I did understand what it was all about, I decided to take a look at the sequel also, since I found so many things to like in that movie, especially the characters and the comic timing. And I'm really glad I decided to make that decision. Despicable Me 2 is, in every way, better than the first movie. Although I don't really like animated movies which don't hold much value other than giving the laughs, this movie is actually much better than most such movies.The thing I really like about Despicable Me 2 is that it is able to expand over the story that the prequel did. Normally in animated movies that are just made for the laughs, the sequels don't work so hard to make the story. They just bring back the villain, and bring in more explosions. There are also characters who are suddenly pulled out of nowhere, which isn't something that happens over here. This movie knows it's just made for the laughs, yet it takes the effort of making it more complicated than it needs to be.Dr Nefarious retires in this movie. I really liked him. He seemed to be something like a grandfather to all the Minions. I still remember the scene where the Minions are working and one of them wears a fruit dress and dances singing something like ""Eto hola macarena kala kala macarena"" (I don't know what it was, but it was so memorable). Then there's the scene where Gru is invited to the secret agency where the two Minions laugh at Bottom.The thing I like about Despicable Me is how many characters there are to love. There's the Minions who are so adorable, there are the three daughters whom I feel like pulling cheeks of, there are the new characters in the form of the Mexican man and Gru's wife. They all have characteristics and emotions, and the movie takes time to explore over all of them. In live action movies this is easy since their runtime is higher, but in animated movies where the runtime is less than two hours, this is actually a pretty big deal.Although Despicable Me 2 isn't exactly what I'd call a memorable movie, it is fun while it lasts; something it promises of being. It's not something that you're gonna carry in your memory for the rest of your life, but that's probably what makes it so much fun to rewatch. It's a definite recommendation for anyone who is looking forward to watching something fun for the weekend with children.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Not as mature or as competent, even, as the first, but still just as passive and so just as adequate.","Again, 'Despicable Me 2 (2013)' is a very passive experience that fails to engage on almost any level. This time, though, there's this odd, almost meta-textual edge which has the feature fully embrace its animated format to the point where characters will just break-out into dance, or even song at some points, while strangely leering at the camera. The plasticity has also been at least doubled so that people will flail about all over the shop and take ludicrous amounts of bodily-harm without so much as a scratch. All this adds up to this bizarre combination that makes it feel much more like a self-aware cartoon than a proper computer-generated film. What doesn't help its credibility either, is that the central character's arc has been entirely excised and almost all development gutted from the feature, leading to a series of skits featuring nothing but caricatures in slap-stick situations desperate to make small children chuckle. The movie skews very young throughout, with only one or two jokes that made me laugh, and yet it still passes the time as adequately as the first even though it isn't as competent in terms of its story. Its a different beast, one that isn't as mature or even quite as competent, but it is still just as decent because it is almost exactly as passive an experience. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Something for the whole family! 9/10,"Review: This is how all animation movies should be. With a mixture of adult and kiddie humour, this movie was great and for a sequel, it's just as good as the first one. Making nearly a billion dollars, I think that the audiences also enjoyed this really funny movie. The minions made the movie, and the storyline was great for a animated movie. The whole look and feel of the movie was also brilliant, and the director cleverly added some sing-a-longs which all kiddie movies should have. The love element was also cleverly added into this movie, but it didn't spoil the flow of the movie because of the mad purple minions and the Mexican baddie. I just hope that it doesn't take years to bring out a third one. Brilliant!Round-Up: Its hard to believe that the first movie came out 3 years ago, because it's still fresh in my mind, which just shows how great this franchise is. I loved the face expressions of the characters, especially the girls who were sweet. Gru has become the loving father who is looking for love, whilst fighting baddies at the same time. It has something for everyone and it's put together well. I think that you can tell that I haven't got anything bad to say about the movie so just watch it.Budget: $76million Worldwide Gross: $920million (WOW!)I recommend this movie to people who were fans of the first one and who loved the minions. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Likable but not as good as first. A little small minded,"This movie was a little fun. Especially when the minions are involved but honestly, I am so sick of Disney/Pixar feeling they have to turn to the 'love story' as a result for creating a plot. And the fact that this film had a ""everyone should have a mommy"" sub-plot in it made me really upset for all the children out there watching it that have a single-parent house-hold (which is a lot of kids out there). The original was more positive since three girls were being adopted from an orphanage (positive and an inspiration for children in an orphanage or not-so-good-household)in which all they wanted was someone to love them (which in the end happens in the original story) but now the focus has been switched to everyone has to find love to be happy 'with a significant other'. I feel this is a step backward for people's moral values. Don't get me wrong, I saw it in 3D which I would recommend (especially at the end with the Minions!!!) but if you are expecting it to exceed the original, as far as funniness, you're wrong. Otherwise, it's a good kids movie with enjoyable parts and I would definitely rent it if you have a 3D TV.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
2 words: Awesome & Adorable!,"I really loved this movie! It was hilarious and at some moments had me rolling on the floor going ""No! They didn't!"" I was dazzled by the first Despicable Me and I can honestly give the producer 2 thumbs up and a job well done! it's not often that you find sequels as good as it's original,But Despicable Me 2 simply blew me away!Though the format of Despicable Me in General is more ""cartoony"" it's graphics is major eye candy. It's fun ,creative, and mesmerizing. The minions are just too cute! Their random moments and constant talk of gibberish adds much comedy and gives DM that ""exciting glow"". I really liked how they continued the plot of Gru transforming from Super villain mastermind to Super hero father.Even though Despicable Me 2 is hilarious it has it's moments where the characters are going through something in life that's relatable to real people (younger and older).Whether it's going through first crushes, dealing with maturing kids , getting back into the dating game ,and even realizing your true love Despicable Me 2 offers the whole family a great relatable experience.Lucy Wilde was an awesome new character to enter Despicable Me.She had a lot of spunk and a eager outgoing personality. The trio of girls Margo ,Edith ,and Agnes definitely got to show off more of who they were even though I wish they still had just a bit More depth to their characters.I was actually surprised Margo, usually the sensible one ,became love struck and lost some sensibleness upon meeting Antonio.But hey! That's how most girls are when they get their first crush: infatuated puppy love!Although I really enjoyed this movie ,rabid purple minion creatures and all,it was kinda predictable .Most of the trailers I hate to say was a sum of the entire movie! That part was just a tad bit of a downer but I still liked Despicable Me 2 all the same.Oh and just saying parents beware.I'm not much of a negative thinker but the part where Gru has to use his belt to find traces of the mutation formula ...um ...it kinda looked like he was humping stuff.There's some more little hoo ha's here and there but that's why it's rated PG.I <3 this movie!

Despicable Me 2 is the funniest movie I seen in a while.,Despicable Me 2 is the sequel to the first Despicable Me which I liked. In fact I liked it more than other people. I saw the movie in 3D and it's OK but not really worth your hard earned cash. My main problem was it was too cliché and I knew what was going to happened in the film which was sad. But it's biggest star are the Minions they are hilarious. They saved this movie and they turned it into comedic gold. The movie was funnier than Monsters University by a mile. But my main problem is it is just a huge comedy there is barely any depth. Sure this is the biggest laughs I had in the cinema and I had a great time overall.

As good as the first or a little better,"Here things improve since normally the second parts are not too good. The villain is excellent, the pacing is blistering, and the minions continue to provide laughs and fun. The problem lies in the need to give a more complex dimension to Gru (they give him a girlfriend) and her adopted daughters (they give one a boyfriend). The characters must be facilitators of jokes and to the extent that this is sustained, any additional ideas are welcome. In this case, it is possible to sustain the script thanks to the excess of the minions who steal the film. The final result is fully satisfactory and resists the passage of time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Even More Entertaining than the Last,"This was just as fun as the last, maybe even more. The comedy still hits, and it still has a strong story. I would say I had more laughs in this one compared to the first. This fits has more of an epilogue for Gru's story. You took the time in the first movie showing him go from despicable to a caring father. This movie kind of shows the after effect of that. The movie did however do a good job at keeping me interested in these characters and their story. The villain, El Macho, was cool, but kind of forgettable. We're supposed to kind of grow with the character, but you can't really do that when he fakes his own death and we didn't know him beforehand.

"Occasionally funny, but hyper and unnecessary","Every once in a while, a movie made for children will surprise me, either because I'm moved by the emotional richness of the script, or something visually astounds me. The original ""Despicable Me"" wasn't entirely either of those things, it just made me laugh. OK, so the scene in the original centered around the three girls and the finger puppet kittens was heartwarming, but not in the same way that Disney or even DreamWorks does 'schmaltz'. It's fair to say that the sequel has even less heart, and more hyperactivity than the first.The story centers around Gru, the former supervillain turned 'legitimate business man and single dad, who gets pulled back into the mix by the 'AVL' (Anti-Villain League). They need him to use his vast knowledge of nefarious ways to pinpoint a new villain that's using a 'serum' that turns things into purple-hued monsters once injected. He's partnered with Lucy (Kristen Wiig), an intense AVL agent who (mild spoiler alert) might just be quirky enough to accept Gru for who he is! Cue the awkward 'getting to know you' moments between the two, the hints from the three adopted girls about getting their dad out on the dating scene, and weave it with the search for the supervillain behind the purple serum, and minions doing their thing, which includes fart guns, singing 90s R&B ballads in minion-speak, and occasionally smacking each other. The villain is fine, and occasionally funny while playing up the cultural stereotypes.Getting back to hyperactivity on-screen, I know that 'kids these days' possess tiny attention spans, enjoy 'shiny' things, and opt for fart jokes or colliding minions to genuine humor, but I've reached my limit. The octogenarian part of my conscience tells me the sugar-induced, ping-pong style of animation lately exceeds acceptable levels, to the point of distraction, and ultimately, boredom. Lately, my child doesn't remember the personalities of most animated characters, or the story arcs, but reminiscing about fart noises and minion speak is easy. It's possible that because he's a boy, those types of silly things are top of mind. I know that ""Despicable Me 2″ isn't around to do anything other than make money, and it has already succeeded greatly in doing that, but I don't know exactly what it accomplishes other than existing as a bloated blooper reel. The creator, Chris Meledandri, has made a name for himself creating beautiful animation that farts, dances, and plays nostalgic or trendy music to get our attention, in an attempt to steal some thunder from the Disney/Pixar machine. The minions sure are initially funny- the first few hundred times they have a slap fight. After that the slapstick humor turns into tired humor. Then they struggle to make someone laugh, then throw in some hyperactive moments. There's nothing truly original here. It's the same idea as ""Three Guys and a Little Lady"" with the math switched around, mixed with some moments reminiscent of ""The Incredibles"", and enough new faces to sell more merchandise at Universal Studios.My last thought- the filmmakers created this universe, but appear to have only a smattering of villains, and no 'heroes'? That's depressing; I figured at this point we'd hear about the 'Superman' of this particular world. If this individual doesn't exist, then how do they define who the villains are? How does the Anti-Villain League operate- is it like MI-6, with Double O agents, or do they call on individuals with extreme intelligence and engineering skills to combat the evil people? Maybe I'm just too caught up in traditional definitions of good versus evil and worthwhile animation and blah. Maybe I'm thinking too much about it (likely). Either way, just like ""Monsters University"", ""Despicable Me 2″ is unnecessary, feels incomplete, but isn't terrible.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
I love it!,"I was hesitant when it first came out because sequels are hard to make. I wasn't disappointed though, because it's so hilarious! It's heartwarming as well, just like the first one.

Gru goes secret agent and falls in love while the Minions are kidnapped,"Released in 2013, ""Despicable Me 2"" is the sequel to the hit 2010 animated film. This time Gru is propositioned by the Anti-Villain League and teams up with Agent Lucy Wilde to find out who stole a mutagen known as PX-41, which turns subjects into aggressive monsters. Gru is convinced that the presumed dead supervillain, El Macho, is responsible while the leader of the Anti-Villain League concludes he's incompetent. Meanwhile Gru goes on his first date, many of his Minions are kidnapped and Margo becomes infatuated by a boy at the mall.Like the original, ""Despicable Me 2"" is zany, consistently amusing and often laugh-out-loud funny. It's hard to determine which one's better as it's simply a continuation of the story with a more James Bond bent and a smidgen of ""Gremlins."" Lucy's a great addition and you can't help but hope a Mulder-Scully relationship develops between Gru and Lucy.The movie runs 98 minutes.GRADE: A-",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Despicable Me 2,"A good movie to rest and relax with for the whole family. No nudity and vulgarity, just the butt of Kevin the minion on the beach. It was subtle and funny, the music was excellent specially the rendition of 'I Swear' (All 4 one). A must see and get a copy for your library too :-) Knowing Steve Steve Carell, Kristen Wiig,and Russell Brand and their caliber of comedy it was hilarious with their blend, it was perfect and very real entertainment.

Feels Exactly Like the First One ... In a Good Way,"Despicable Me 2 is the sequel to Illumination's first animated movie which came out in 2010. In this one, Gru is hired by an organization who wants to capture a criminal who's trying to take over the world because they believe Gru can dentify whether or not he or she is a villain. That's all I'm gonna say.I came into Despicable Me 2 with no expectations. I just didn't know what to expect. I really liked the first movie, but it wasn't a movie that needed a sequel. Still, I'm glad we got it.This movie feels exactly like the first one, but not in a bad way. It has the same feel, same humor, same style of animation and a pretty similar story. But it's all good fun. It's an entertaining ride with funny characters and some good jokes.Just like the first movie, Despicable Me 2 also has heart. So not only are the characters funny, but they're also sympathetic.There's not much I can say about this film. Overall, it was really good.

"Despicable, With a Dose of Delightful","This is a tough one to rate and review. On the one hand, the rendering and quality of the CGI is up to the highest standards (animated films seem to be getting more beautiful with each year that passes); the minions provide the core comedy of the film, being cute and lovable idiots who at heart are really just immoral, child-like agents of chaos; and there are plenty of nods to sci-fi and horror that I found littered about the film.But on the other hand, it seems tired. It doesn't feel like it's added anything new to animated films. Gone are the days of The Little Mermaid, The Lion King, Aladdin, where our heroes aren't complete and utter idiots, but intelligent beings with flaws and emotions we can all connect with.Although the minions are fun, I found this film to be another addition to the ""Let's Dumb Down the Human Race and Little Kids with Silly Idiotic Secretively Violent Characters"" sub-genre of the animated film industry, and the film industry at large. Villains and stupidity have become all the rage.Despicable Me 2 was on my watch list, and I'm glad I gave it a whirl, but I'm hoping one day we get an animated film that brings the same emotional impact the classics used to bring to the table instead of the increasing Hollywood addiction to making stupidity and violence fun by hiding it within seemingly harmless characters in kids movies.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Whole is less than sum of the parts . . .,"This film was a series of sight, sound and writing gags that had almost no continuity, and while funny, did not result in a coherent narrative.The first Despicable Me suffered nearly the identical fate, but the parts of that whole were more robust and formidable - the cruel mother; the dastardly foe; the extreme crime; and just the novelty of all of the unusual imagery.Here? Each part was much reduced. Light laughter, a few LOLs, but zero engagement with the meager plot. I was never drawn into the story, because the story was just a bunch of slight laughs trying to operate as a plot.And isn't anyone going to comment on the notion of the female protagonist being a red-head named Lucy with her hair tied back in a bun? I mean, come on . . . . .",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Was this a different movie?!,"I have a feeling that this movie was gonna be the minions movie before they decided to make a sequel instead. That's what I'm gonna question first: WHY ARE MINIONS FUNNY?! Slapstick IS funny, but when you won't laugh when you see that as an entire movie! That's why the Home Alone sequels didn't work, so why are the creators of this movie getting a pass? And the minions' comedy is just that: slapstick overload! So, now that that is out of the way, let's talk about something else. GRU IS BLAND AS HELL!!! Whenever I hear him talk, I hear a bored, uninterested Steve Carrel waiting for his paycheck. And he only cares about himself until someone he knows is in trouble. And the girls! My GOD is this a waste of Miranda Cosgrove! She is a good actress and she was even very good in the first Despicable Me, but she just SUCKS here. The smallest one is a boring character, and I don't remember ONE LINE OF DIALOGUE from the middle child. I would go on and on about all the other characters, but I won't. And the plot just plain up SUCKS!!! Again, it feels like a Minions movie that needed a plot to have a sequel to the first film. It feels slow and boring, and I'm convinced that the script writers were high while writing such inane dialogue, comedy, and characters!!! NEVER WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!

"A perfect example of what not to do with a sequel, but still half enjoyable.","I really enjoyed the original film but had serious doubts that they could do much with a sequel. However, the trailer made me quite hopeful so I actually walked into this film with high expectations.But within minutes it was obvious that this film was falling into all the obvious traps for bad sequels. In the opening party scene it was clear that these were not the same characters from the original but just caricatures of them.Why did they have to make Gru such an incompetent idiot this time around? Makes it hard to root for him. The introduction of Lucy, as a potential love interest, could've added a lot to the story if they had not made her so irritating. Instead, she is just an annoyance.The only bright spot for much of the film would be the minions, though even they wear out their welcome in a prolonged musical interlude towards the end.The action climax is so good that it almost allows you to ignore the rest of the film's flaws but in the end I am left imagining the great film that this could've been if the story had received even a fraction of the imagination that went into the visuals.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Funny how? Felt disappointed,"This is what often happens with sequels, they disappoint the viewer – this means they are not as interesting as the first movie. This movie is not funny by any level and the character Gru lacks what he brought in the original movie (unpredictable behavior). I actually admired the character in the first movie, and some of that evilness in Gru should have stayed with the Character. This is what the title is based on (despicable me. Any change in the character takes the whole concept out and the movie becomes a repetition of hundreds of movies where the hero is at risk and then get saved at the last minute.

Jack in the Box,"Despicable Me was a success the moment it opened, a literal out-of-nowhere film that had the makings of a huge box office hit. Not surprising the challenge that followed in making something better. I brought my BLT sandwich, as ever, in case of mediocre results.The screening was packed. Little kids everywhere, a real logistics nightmare for the parents and cinema. They loved it, making horrible noises and kicking. Particularly upon the appearance of the minions - there's a huge cash cow waiting if they can produce another film, perhaps even a nonsensical minion spin off. Some rather original jokes, steady plot. Enjoyed the fact that most of the film takes place in one location, none of this fancy, lets fly to Africa and back nonsense of other films, where they feel exciting locations makes up for an inconsistency in dialogue. Nothing violent, no foul language, a fine plot for its target audience. A meagre sense of pace, quite a lot of change in direction, but overall one may enjoy this as much as his children. If you have younger counterparts, take them to see this, they will enjoy it. The sort of thing they'll look back on in later life and say ""Remember how good this was?"" as we all did with our TV and films. Though, unfortunately, they never have quite the same effect years on.Although it's not really aimed at folks my age, the film had pleasant moments. They have managed to exceed themselves. Not my type of film at all, in fact I don't know why I went, but these days films just don't get me going like they used to, so I went mainly to review. I found my BLT getting quite dry, but this film did not enough to withhold me from my sandwich. And nice it was.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Dumb, obnoxious, unfunny and lazy","Despicable Me 2 was annoying, unfunny, cheap and really bad. The animation was lazy, the movies has no grasp in terms of actual quality animation, not only a lot of the backgrounds are repeated with no really variation into the environment making look cheap, but a lot movement of the characters, their modeling and their design was kept in a minimal and simplistic level and it's visually poor and awful looking, and also easy to make. The movie recycles a cheap and overused plot involving spies and so forth and it's very predictable in the sense that it doesn't do anything new or inventive, including there's no reason these movies should exist, it's completely pointless and it got made in order to make a profit at the box office, considering the big revenues the first one gained.

A Middling Continuation of Gru's Adventures; Lightly Entertaining,"Picking up right where the original left off, evil genius Gru has seen the error of his ways and transitioned into life as the single, adoptive dad of three young girls. The sudden reform has left everyone (an army of minions, a long-time collaborator and Gru himself) a bit stir-crazy, so he seeks new thrills as a turncoat, tracking and identifying his former rivals for a stuffy government agency. Illumination has leveled-up their equipment since the first film, which makes for a far more polished visual product, but the story is less lively and fuzzy than its surprising predecessor. Of course the minions are everywhere, getting the star treatment before their inevitable spin off, but the girls are relegated to watery secondary story lines and there seem to be a lot of missed opportunities. Gru's job with the g-men, for instance, seems like a ready-made setup for introducing all sorts of wacky new characters and enlarging the world, but instead it merely hones in on a single new villain and ventures no further. The introduction of a love interest is hesitant, overly convenient, and never really clicks. There's plenty of fun stuff for younger audiences, of course, and some of the sight gags are clever, but most parents will find themselves daydreaming through the bulk of this one.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"An excuse to make a lucrative sequel, basically backed by the Minions.","This film is the more than expected sequel to ""Despicable Me"", which is naturally motivated by its huge box office success. The script revolves around a theft of a chemical formula that turns the most harmless creatures into monsters. The central characters of the first film are back, but the entire script is a poor excuse to make a sequel and revolves around the Minions, clearly the stars of the film, almost obscuring the main character. It's worth watching this movie just because of them. It was a conscious bet of the production team, given the explosive popularity reached by these little yellow creatures similar to cheese snacks. It worked. He managed to make the film a success. But the quality of the movie lost with that.The plot also plays with romance involving Gru or his eldest daughter. This is a more interesting and appealing subplot but its not enough to make the film truly interesting. This is an adventure movie, not a romantic story like ""Lady and the Tramp"", ""Beauty and the Beast"" or others. And the truth is that this film has a lot of funny, it's very romantic but it has little adventure and action, and the public that hoped for it later felt disappointed in their expectations.This movie is not bad. But it's also not as great as the first movie was. The first movie was a good story, with good characters, an excellent comic vein and good animation. This movie had all of this except the good story, which should be the center of everything else. It's still funny, but that is not enough to make it a great movie.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

This movie tried too hard to play it safe.,"I loved the first ""Despicable Me"", as it was a great movie. All the ingredients were there: The anti-hero Gru using three orphan girls to take on the world, while they use him to evade their orphanage and in the course of actions they all find themselves being a family. Simple and beautiful. Hence i was skeptical when i found out there was a second movie coming. And rightly so.Sure, for itself it still is an acceptable movie with cute jokes. But it doesn't have the emotional values of the first one. The story is a slapstick secret agent plot garnished with some superficial coming-of-age ideas and a kitschy love-story. Nothing serious, about the depth of an average sitcom. It just plays safe.And by doing that it sorta kicks the soul of its predecessor overboard. The worst is how the mandatory happy-end is handled.

"Not as funny as the other two movies in the franchise, but alright.","I highly enjoyed Despicable Me and the recent spin-off with the Minions, but I have mixed feelings about DM2. Granted, the animation has greatly improved since the first DM and some of the jokes are REALLY funny(the Minions at some parts, mostly Agnes), but there are some characters that were obnoxious and/or underdeveloped(Lucy, Margo, Edith) and even some of the humor is simplistic and childish(fart noises, pratfalls). What sucks is that in the other two DM movies in the franchise, the kid factor was very well realised and one of the many things that made them entertaining. But here, there is just way too much of it and it's often in your face. Other than a handful of hysterical gags and some detailed animation, DM2 is just an OK movie that doesn't hit the mark with me the way it did with DM and Minions. I did like the 3D conversion and the minion knight fight gag(I laughed so hard I cried on that one), as well as Agnes being cute and funny along with the Minions sometimes, but it's an overrated film that is strictly for the kids. Watch the first DM or go see Minions 3D,both movies I thought were great animated comedies and should be recognized more than this average film.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Just a typical sequel...,"Honestly, sequels to movies are never very good. Unless it is a to-be- continued sequel. This one, however, is a ""let's make another movie to continue this movie, even though it doesn't need to be continued, for the sake of extra money and spotlight!"" sequel. This movie felt like a tired, formal shell of the original.I usually find that when it comes to a poor movie or TV show, the issue will be that it was a good idea, but wasn't done well. That is the issue with this movie. The plot line was rather creative but the gags were weak, the characters were bland, there was too much lazy filler which had left me uninterested in the middle of the movie, and the ending was predictable.If you liked Gru's original character, expect a lot out of movies, or are a feminist, then this isn't the movie for you.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Worth watching,I just watched the movie today with my family. This simply had me laughing the whole time. I found really touching and lovely the picturing of Gru's struggles and deals with being now a good guy and being a father at the same time. The introduction of charismatic characters such as the villain and Lucy Wilde made the movie pretty enjoyable. And then there's the minions. Those little yellow fellows helps through the movie a lot.

I hate to use this word, but I think it's a masterpiece.I thought it was very well done, but frankly was hard to follow especially the last half hour.

Delightful Me Too,"This film is recommended.Minions everywhere, rejoice! Reformed evil mastermind Gru (Steve Carell) is now out of the spy business. Gru is content to while away the hours with as a typical family man with his three adopted orphans at his side. That is, until he is pulled back into the world of espionage by Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wigg), in Despicable Me 2, the popular sequel to this entertaining franchise.This time, Gru's mission is to stop another evil mastermind, El Macho (Benjamin Bratt) who is hatching a grand scheme of world dominance using the comical minions as his prey.This film is more of the same childish shenanigans as the first. It follows its tried-and-true formula without much re-direction into its own inventiveness. But what this sequel has that the original lacked is a stronger screenplay with sly humor, better developed characters, and sight gags that are very funny. Directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud create an off- kilter world that winningly pokes fun at the spy genre and make the film very family-friendly for any age demographics.The computer animation is top notch with brilliant colors and strong details. Voiceovers by Carell, Wigg, and Bratt make their characters come to life, as do the fine support by Russell Brand, Miranda Cosgrove, Elsie Fisher, Dana Gaier, and both directors who create the Minion- speak language throughout the film. The exaggerated characters, their subtle expressions, and the inspired farcical movement add to the festivities. One can't help but delight in the mindless antics and slapstick, especially whenever the Minions are on screen. They upstage everyone in the movie and are given more screen time in this film, a wise decision. Their vocal mash-ups and visual traits are the perfect antidote to chasing the blues (or purples) away.Despicable Me 2 is fun from the start to finish.

Hilarious As Hell But Also Emotionally Hollow,"Hilarious as hell thanks to total Minion madness, but also completely hollow at its core due to the absence of the very ingredient that made its predecessor an unexpected success of its year, Despicable Me 2 is an unabashedly funny ride when the screen is occupied by the little yellow henchmen but apart from that, everything about this sequel is a step down.The follow-up to Despicable Me, Despicable Me 2 continues the journey of Gru as the ex- supervillain finds himself adjusting to a normal family life with his three daughters & is also attempting an honest living in the jam business. But when he is recruited by the Anti-Villain League for assistance in their latest investigation, his prime suspect turns out to be a legendary supervillain, presumed dead long ago.Co-directed by Pierre Coffin & Chris Renault, Despicable Me 2 features an action-packed plot, more characters & major upgrades in minions screen time but it still ends up finishing as an inferior sequel for the charm, freshness & heart of the original is sorely missing. Even its attempt at humour feels forced at times, the plot follows a generic route & the new voice cast don't bring any sort of novelty to their characters either.The technical aspects are pretty much the same as the original. Cinematography adds more colours to its palette, Editing could've used a little more trimming for there are scenes that don't contribute to its story at all, background score has the feel of the original, and the 3D animation also offers a slight improvement over its predecessor. But its writers are always trying to conceal its paper-thin plot by sugarcoating it with more minion segments.It's in the moments without the minions where the film's shortcomings are clearly exposed. Gru's arc is demoted from a cool supervillain to a boring hero although Steve Carell does chip in with another impressive work. However Gru's three daughters are sidelined for the most part. The minions once again steal the show effortlessly with their slapstick antics & hilarious impressions and it's only because of them that the film isn't a chore to sit through.On an overall scale, Despicable Me 2 is a passable sequel to Despicable Me that may lack the heartfelt emotions of its predecessor but makes up for it with its roller-coaster minions madness. A delightful, light-hearted & crazy fun ride for viewers of all ages, this follow-up chapter will manage to leave most families satisfied but for those who were looking forward to something more than the usual minion mischief are bound to leave with a slight feeling of incompleteness.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
